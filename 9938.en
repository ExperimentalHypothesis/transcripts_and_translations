Interview Australia, 18 May 1987.

Uncompleted Journalist: [Inaudible] Shri Mataji: You see, because I try to know so much about religions. Journalist: Yes. Shri Mataji: Because I’m dealing with all kind of religious people Journalist: With- yes. Shri Mataji: And then you see, within ourselves, it’s - there is a religion, human religion. Journalist: Right. Shri Mataji: That is actually our valency, it’s our valency. Journalist: Our well being? Shri Mataji: Valency is a thing- the carbon has four valencies, we have also ten valencies within us. Journalist: I don’t know this word. Shri Mataji: Valency is a word of chemical, chemistry, valency, v-a-l-e-n-c-y Journalist: And it’s something new Shri Mataji: Well it is within us, you see, this ten qualities a human being has . Journalist: We have ten valencies. Shri Mataji: Ten valences. And once we are missing in that, then we are missing in our personality. Journalist: And it seams that you have all sorts of relationship with people’s psyche and the problems they have, but we will always say there are psychosomatic. Shri Mataji: Yes. Psychosomatic diseases or human physical diseases all are because we are very much going into extremes, you see. So there are imbalances in our character.

Journalist: Given that you are living in London it must be odd of you- I mean ... not even from your own base.
Shri Mataji: But it started in India, I shouldn’t say that.
Journalist: It did!
Shri Mataji: It first started first. First, first twelve Sahaja Yogis were from India.
Journalist: The first twelve
Shri Mataji: 12 Sahaja Yogis. They are called as Sahaja Yogis - Yogis
Journalist: Oh, really? And you’re the founder of the-
Shri Mataji: Yes, I’m the founder.
Journalist: And was it nineteen seventy?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Journalist: And I believe Australia now is the first growing?
Shri Mataji: Yes it is, it’s something really remarkable I tell you.
Journalist: And this must go like this the last six or seven years.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Suddenly, you see, I think Australians have a quality of innocence in them
Journalist: Right.
Shri Mataji: They have.
Journalist: And.... The first chakel-you call it chakel?
Sahaja Yogi: Chakra.
Shri Mataji: Chakra, yes. And first chakra is Australia and New Zealand, yes, first chakra of innocence.
Journalist: Ok, which makes us more-
Shri Mataji: Innocent, yes. You are innocent people. Calibre also because of innocence, calibre. But you are very innocent and - But you understand innocence and you respect innocence also I think.
Journalist: And obviously, you had a time with the background Rajneshes and you totally discredit him. Does that make difficult, does that make people more resistant to listen to you or? I believe you denounced him.
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, all of them. I ‘ve denounce all of them, openly,
Journalist: All of them.
Shri Mataji: With their name. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
Journalist: Yes, Yes...
Shri Mataji: You see this is a- you see, what are they here for? That’s the main point is, you see? They are just there for making money, that’s all.
Journalist: Alright.
[Cut in the video]

... Shri Mataji: Because the whole hall was filled. Some were sitting even on the ground. And when they got their Realization they said: "It was like a -" what‘d you say to the, when you open the bottle of Champagne? Booze, booze, "It came out like a booze!" They said "Mother".
Journalist: Alright.
Shri Mataji: Yes, so many of them.
Journalist: And this is-you’re just talking to them, sitting [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: No, I just - I was talking to them and I told them how you can raise your residual force, the Kundalini, the force that gives you Realization. That is the reflection of the Holy Ghost with us. Christians also don’t know what’s the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the Kundalini, which is the residual force in the triangular bone, you see?
Journalist: Whoa!
Shri Mataji: And when it humps, they make them rise, rise it, with their own hands and then suddenly they felt the booze coming out of their heads.
Journalist: Right. So if I went along and I was sceptical, and I went to the meeting and I went through the mechanics of, of – how you would you describe?
Shri Mataji: Sometimes, the reporters also get it, surprisingly. They’re cynical, I Think. [Shri Mataji laughs] Because they meet all kind of funny people, I tell you, so it’s difficult to believe in a genuine person, you see,
Journalist: Yes.
Shri Mataji: There are very few genuine people in this world. So the whole attitude is different.
Journalist: Alright, yes. And when that resistance stops.
Shri Mataji: It’s that, even if they, I mean, don’t want to have it you see, you cannot force it on anyone.
Journalist: And you’re not about to force it on anyone.
Shri Mataji: Not at all. You have to ask it from your heart because Holy Ghost is the pure desire within you, pure desire to be one with the Divine.
Journalist: And you would not want to identify one single God or whatever.
Shri Mataji: No, not at all, it’s not that way. It’s all of them, all of the incarnations, every one of them, are the milestones of our evolution.
Journalist: [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Of our evolution. And this is the evolutionary process, the epitome of the last breakthrough of our evolutionary process.

Journalist: Can you explain to me a question apparently a gentleman did not know you few days ago, and he has found what you believe may be a cure for AIDS or, can you explain that? Cause you know that’s going to cause all sorts of reactions
Shri Mataji: Ha. AIDS. Now, AIDS, so far, I did definitely cure one person, no doubt.
Journalist: Yes, and it’s only the one person.
Shri Mataji: One person. But he came from TM
Journalist: Transcendental Meditation.
Shri Mataji: Trans-Med
Journalist: Right.
Shri Mataji: Now, I told him not to go to in any again and finish it off.
Journalist: O, really?
Shri Mataji: Yes
Journalist: Why?
Shri Mataji: Because they try all these entities and those things just to capture your attention and capture you.
Journalist: Well, they have a whole philosophy, you mean.
Shri Mataji: All like that. They mesmerize actually. This fellow, he was treated, he was alright. The doctors said that he had not this thing in his blood. His parents were very happy.
But again, he went to the same. Naturally, you feel, you see –then he died also.
He came back to me. I said: “Now I cannot treat you”. “Now it’s alright, finished”. “I cannot go on all the time. Why did you go? I mean I told you.”
Journalist: Yes. This is the man that became IO and was looking to TM for relaxation
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no. He was in TM
Journalist: Yes.
Shri Mataji: And there, I don’t know, he became homosexual because in the TM, in those days- you are not supposed to see your wife, you see, you have to live with men, you’re forced.
Journalist: You don’t.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no! All this nonsense, we don’t believe in all this nonsense. No, no! You have to be married; you have to happy husband and wife.
Journalist: And you didn’t believe in funny clothes.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, nothing.
Journalist: Or begging on the street, or.
Shri Mataji: No. We have to be very normal people.
Journalist: Whoa.
