My Dear Children,

What are you searching?

Why are you aimlessly and listlessly running about?

The joy that you have searched in material gains, the joy that you are looking for in power, the joy that disappeared in the words of books--the so-called knowledge--is all lost in yourself, and you are still searching and seeking!

You can pay attention to everything outside yourself! You are lost in your thoughts, like babes in the wood! But there is great hope that you can rise into the Heaven of "thoughtless" awareness, which we call Self-realisation.

I invite you to this feast of Divine Bliss, which is pouring around you, even in this Kali-yuga, in these God-forsaken modern times.

I hope you will come and enjoy the spiritual experience of the Life Eternal.

With all My love and blessings.

Your Mother,

NIRMALA
