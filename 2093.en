Celebration of Shri Mataji's Birthday. Bombay (India), 30 March 1983.

First Bhajan, “Bbhay kaya taya Prabhu Jyachare,” was sung. Shri Mataji remarked, “That was My father’s favorite song”.

Many people have always asked me that why God created this Universe. Of course, we are not supposed to ask questions to God. It’s easy to ask questions to Mataji when She is giving a lecture. But God is a person who is beyond questions. And why He created Universe is something like why I wore all these ornaments. As I am not habituated of wearing ornaments, but I have to do it. I have to do it just to please you people, or we can say that God created this earth, just to please His own children, just to make them happy, just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God, to give all that what He has got.

So He had to create this creation in such a way that He could create His own image, reflect it and make it enjoy itself. It’s a very mutual appreciation, as we call it, andolan. Whatever He does for us, is for His own pleasures. But the beauty of it is that your pleasure is His pleasure. And the other way round is, His pleasure should be your pleasure, too.

Once that becomes the fact that the pleasure of God becomes your pleasure, you enter into that beautiful arena of heavenly joy, swargiya anand. Only if it is one-sided enterprise or one-sided effort, it gets lost. Human efforts are one-sided, but God’s efforts are such that they cannot be enjoyed unless and until they are reflected by.

So whatever He has given us we cannot count them, we can only say they are blessings, because it’s an abstract way of saying things. That is the blessing of God, that He has given all the blessings. It’s an abstract thing, because we cannot count, we cannot give it a form, we cannot say what He has done for us.

And when this joy of His creation is felt in our heart, once we start enjoying that joy within ourselves, then it becomes a complete picture. When it is complete you cannot describe it, because it is not relative. You can just enjoy it. And that is how the depth of enjoyment is described, that at that depth, what are we to say? We are lost. The drop has become the ocean and the ocean has become the drop.

First the ocean becomes the drop and then drop becomes the ocean. And then the ocean tries to become the drop. It’s a beautiful system of give and take, which can only be appreciated by people who have tasted the nectar of the beauty of God’s love. It’s very easy to say there is no God. It’s the easiest thing to say. But it is even easier to enjoy God than that. Is the easiest thing to enjoy Him because He is so available. He is so anxious. The whole purpose of creation is to give you joy, to give you happiness.

As today when I had to go to the bank, I was wondering, “I have never worn these ornaments anytime in life, and today as the time has come and I have to wear.” I just thought of it, “It’s just for my children”. If I have to wear them, what does it matter? Just to make them happy, what does it matter? If they feel happy, then My happiness is complete. But you felt for Me, that I should wear, itself shows that you wanted to see them on Me. Is also such esteem of your very subtle bhakti, very subtle love for your Mother.

In these modern times, to have such bhaktas, itself is a big blessing for Me. So as you say, “Mother, bless us,” I say, “You also bless Me.” You have already blessed me by this beautiful arrangement you have made, the way you have put yourself, surrendered yourself for this great puja. Because all is such an interdependent process. You do the puja. I can’t do the puja. You have to do the puja. When you do the puja, the chakras are awakened. Mine are awakened, but in you they are awakened.

Now how to explain to people what is the importance of puja is. If you have not tasted the fruit of a puja it is impossible to explain. It is at a higher level only one can understand all these things. But so far whatever was done was at such a lower level by such low type of people that everything became absolutely unholy. It was all unholy doing and because of that unholy doing God himself is unhappy.

So He has created this Universe to create realized souls, not to create useless people, not to create people who do not believe in God, who do not believe in higher life, who do not believe in leading a life of purity. He never created this Universe for them. They are just existing, just like dead people. They are not living people. So those who believe in God, those who worship Him with all purity, are actually, in a way, giving blessings to God because it is so pleasurable for Him to see that they have understood, that they have felt it, that they have liked it.

Sahaj Yogis also, some of them have problems, doesn’t matter. But as long as the desire is pure, your Kundalini is pure, as long as you feel you that you have to do your ascent in a proper way, in a surrendered way, everything is going to become a complete beautiful picture.

And to create this elevated Kingdom of God within our heart and without, one has to know that God’s efforts are absolutely complete. He has made you.

Now only little less is there. It’s from the other side. He has created this universe so beautifully and after creating that beautiful universe, that universe has to reflect God fully. That’s all. So the fifty percent job is done. Only other fifty percent job you have to do. You should not worry if there are people who are not interested in Sahaj Yog, those who are not going to do meditation, those who are not going to do puja, those who do not enjoy this higher life. Just don’t worry about them. But you must know that you are special people, and that you have to create the nucleus, the complete body of that part, which is going to complete this work of great faith.

Today I am so enamoured that the speed of everything has come down to zero for Me now. Nothing is moving. There is no gati in Me now left, so enamoured and overwhelmed by your celebration, by your kindness, that I just don’t know how to express Myself. All this is suggestive of such tremendous depth and gratitude in your hearts for something I have done nothing whatsoever. I have done nothing, because I have not achieved anything in life Myself. I was what I am. I will be the same. I have not done any tapasya or anything. I have not walked even an inch to achieve my goal. It’s you who have prepared yourself, who have come closer and closer, just like a ready lamp, a Deepak, and got yourself ignited, enlightened yourself, because of your preparation. It’s only your own doing, which has given this light everywhere.

You know very well that light cannot spread in vacuum. It cannot spread. If there is vacuum, light cannot spread. That’s why without the Sahaj Yogis, I have no existence at all. I don’t exist. My whole existence is here because of you. I have no meaning. I have no work. I don’t do any work at all. I am the one who is the laziest and who doesn’t do any work whatsoever. It’s only you who have achieved it. It is you who have raised yourself. Actually, your birthdays must be celebrated, instead of Mine, because neither I am getting old nor young. I am just the same. There is no difference in anyway.

And I think it should be the birthday of Sahaj Yoga which should be celebrated today.

That we can say today, that it is about twelve years some months that Sahaj Yoga was started on a public basis, though I started it long time back, I don’t know how many years back. So, at this stage we have to understand that puja is an abstract achievement which can only be experienced and all of you should sit with that feeling that we are going to achieve nothingness within us, egoless, egolessness, emptiness, cleansing, so that the light of love should flood all the areas within us. And that is only possible when, of course, the chakras are to be awakened. That’s going to work out and also that you should open out your hearts completely. Not to doubt anything, not to think about anything, but just open your hearts, just receive it, with complete faith and understanding.

You have people from all over the countries, so many countries. All the world is represented here. I feel that already we have touched every corner of the world. On this day only thing we have to declare that let Sahaja Yoga become a Mahayoga in its full way. That everybody in the whole world should recognize that Sahaj Yoga is the only way people can rise in their evolution and a new world can be created. And this kind of a development, which is a collective development, which is not of outer world but of the inner world, which generate the roots of this creation into a new dimension, into a new personality, because by that time, the roots would have reached the source, source of this Divine love, of this All-pervading Power of this Brahmashakti.

Today I would request you, that you all should take a vow, that all of you will try to bring more people to Sahaj Yoga and try to save as many as possible through all your efforts. That’s the only thing if you can give me on My birthday I’ll be very much thankful.

May God bless you all.

[Marathi to English transltaion]

In Maharashtra, you can't live without speaking Marathi. You should speak a little Marathi, And the fact that we have survived for seven years, means, we've managed somehow. AAAA, the speciality of Marathas, Saints who were born in this land, have poured water on their foreheads. saints have preached a lot, and Gods have erected 3 and a half peethas here. Ashtavinayaks are residing here, by receiving all this, if people of Maharashtra do not achieve divinity, then people of Maharashtra will be answerable to everyone. one should keep in mind, lot of effort has been done in Maharashtra.

Nowhere so many saints were born, even though there is speciality in this Land, if still Sahaja Yoga doesn’t prosper here then there is no hope of happening elsewhere. In Maharashtra, there are many misdemeanours which has affected people here. All this should be destroyed, I mean, all types of tobacco and so on. Today all of you should decide that if a person takes tobacco then he should not be invited for food at home. Abandon him. Tobacco is rampant in our country, but there is a lot of use of tobacco in Maharashtra. So if he is an addict, don't call him, tell him that Shri Krishna has told us. that if you are using tobacco, you don't sit in our company. There are many misdemeanours in Maharashtra. in which this is worse. If you get rid of it, the language will be sweeter. It's a small thing, but the lesson learnt will be very beautiful. The rest I will remove. just take care of the tobacco issue.

Everyone should share the work. There are also people who see it as a lot of work, One gift after another is flying. and there are people who have come, from the places where usage of tobacco has increased. So, please I request all of you, to take my name without any fear. But do not go after tobacco. As the type of tobacco is going to be very terrible now. I am telling you, I have already said this. Then don't tell me, Mataji, you didn't warn us. Tobacco is of very dangerous variety, people have been taking tobacco for many years. But people should think about, why now, due to tobacco people are suffering more. There must be some reason why tobacco is taboo now to Almighty, so, you should understand and give up tobacco completely. This is a request on my Birthday, to the entire Maharashtrian community.

The glory of Maharashtra is too big, this country got the name Maharashtra, that too, from time immemorial, no one can tell, why Maharashtra and from when? When Sanskrit was first seen, like, a simple response, at that time, Maharashtrian language and culture became very popular There are five languages in this country. There are five languages in this country, hence it became Maharashtra, So Maharashtra is eternal. Before Shri Rama, this country was still Maharashtra. I mean how eternal this country is. And a lot of area of Dandakaranya come in Maharashtra, not entirely. some parts of it come from Dandkaranya and some do not. Some parts are in Maharashtra Hence this was all pre-planned by God Almighty, such a special land was prepared. The meaning of it is so huge, that we will come to know gradually. If anything seems uncommunicative now, then in Sahaj Yoga everything comes out gradually.

So, realise that, we are sitting in a very big land of virtue. Now for example, we enquired about a land I said, you should buy this land, but at that time people did not understand, that why Mataji is after this land. People’s thinking is such that, why Mataji is after this land. But they do not think that there is something, Now, a big article has appeared in the newspaper about that land, and all the sacred work has been done there since Tretayuga and how important the land is, and, Prahlad wandered there and that is the place of Shandilya Muni etc. When it was published, the people of Maharashtra realized that what Mataji has said was very special and that she did not ask for it unless it had some meaning.

So in such a situation, one should understand that if we learn about some thing through vibrations, it is deep, and if I understand, it is very deep. And so I don't over-describe the depth of this Maharashtra, but I only say that this is a very beautiful place. So, to protect her, and to protect her sanctity, In this Maharashtra, the real roots of Sahaja Yoga will be found. So, the minds of the people of Maharashtra should be fully awakened. In whatever way we can, We should do this. In Maharashtra if you spread Sahaja Yoga, I have no doubt that it will spread all over the world. Because the saviour of entire world i.e. Shri Ashtavinayaks are rooted in Maharashtra, also Ramdas Swami has hoisted, many Shri Hanuman’s in this state. Many tasks have been done here, and due to its essence, this land has turned sacred, people of Maharashtra should know it's merits.

In Maharashtrian language there is a special edge, and by holding morality and purity, it can be hoisted like a sword. But even then, the idea that you don't want to learn another language is wrong. If we do not respect other languages, we cannot spread Sahaja yoga in those languages. So, all the Maharashtrian’s today should decide, that we should learn other languages, and respect others. And for them in our Maharashtra we should with great heart invite others wholeheartedly accept them. On me, you people have lot of faith, which is very deep, and why is it so deep? neither you nor I can say why? But nothing like this happens without any reason. Unless there is old or new relationship, such things don’t happen. Keeping that in mind, why are we going deeper, what is it that we did? Instead of thinking that, we might have done something, with such complete thought, in mind one must have self esteem..

A kind of complete confidence one should invoke within oneself. We must be something, that’s why Mother has blessed us. Keeping this in mind, if you move ahead, then rest of queries will be gone. Then we are something, so Mataji blessed us, and we have attained. We have got, what was our's. And what we have received we should spread. We are something that’s why we received; hence we should spread it, because we are something. We are something, so you can’t be polite, since we are something, we have to share. That’s what you people are, so joyful and beautiful, let others tell you, somebody else will tell, others will tell about us. When it will come to your observation, you will be surprised. Let this day improve you all, be joyful, and be like festival. Whatever I can do for you I have already decided it. Now, whatever you want to do, go ahead with it. I don't want to say anything. Perform the Puja as you wish. No need to take permission for anything. You do what you think is right, I am ready for everything.
