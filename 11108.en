BEWARE, DEAR ASPIRANTS

BEWARE, DEAR ASPIRANTS .THERE IS A JUDAS WITHIN US . BE CAREFUL. HE WALKS WITH US, WORKS WITH US. SINGS THE PRAISES OF THE DIVINE MOTHER, BUT HE IS AN UGLY SERPENT, THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SATAN, WHO IS IN DISGUISE. HE HELPED TO CRUCIFY CHRIST IN A SLY MANNER. HE MAY BE A WOMAN LIKE POOTANA, WHO CAME TO POISON THE CHILD KRISHNA.

LET US ALL KNOW THE ONENESS IN OUR MOTHER’S LOVE. AND TAKE GUIDANCE IN THE BURNING FLAME OF HER DIVINITY. GUARD AGAINST SUCH SHIP SINKERS IN THE SHIP OF SAHAJA YOGA.

MAY GOD GIVE YOU KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW THE EVIL GENIUS – THE NEGATIVITY PERSONIFIED.
