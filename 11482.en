Talk to Sahaja Yogis

[Missing part] After that she sat down at least. And then she said to Me, “Mother, I must say this Chaya, what must have she done in her last life to be married to a man like that?” After that she never took his side. Always she used to come and tell Me that, “Chaya told Me that he’s such a funny man.” She wants as soon as he comes in the room I should enter into the room. She says, “I feel shy.” I mean, [Hindi]. If they have no understanding then we [can’t, cannot] do anything. Do you feel shy? You shouldn’t do that. You really feel shy. I mean, there’s something like shyness. She said, “I find it impossible, you know, with this man. I feel very shy and I feel very embarrassed.” She wanted to, [see with/show] us some nice film, she wanted to see. So this fellow said, “No, you should only see it with me.” She said, “But you are not coming. If you come [then we’ll go together, I will not go out].” He couldn’t bear her going with other friends. Can you imagine? Such a jealous spot. [Hindi]

I mean, we are not complicated. In the same way, get rid of your complications. Like who will now get married. I mean, they must have arguing. That’s important. And they come out fighting, both of them. No one can sleep there. In that Brompton Square, can you imagine, that such a supposed to be spot place. Once I was there in the evening time. Who was with Me that day? None of you. He came out of that place, from Brompton Square. About twelve o’clock in the night we were going back. And one girl and one boy came out. Not girl and boy, quite old I would say, well the girl was about, and the boy was twenty-five, the girl was twenty-two or something. He was pulling her by her hair and she was beating him. I said, “What’s this going on?” He said, “We are married.” I said, “Really?” If they are married then they are supposed to fight. When they are not married they are supposed to love. It’s a funny junction. Find the absurdity? So you get out of this thing. This kind of madness, it’s not good.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s funny.

[Recording interrupted]

Shri Mataji: You see, Chaya told Me, he’s such a henpecked husband. This is we call as [Hindi/henpecked], who runs after the wife all the time. Looks funny, you know. Must have [also/ a] your self-respect.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: So one must develop a real style. It’s an education. It’s an education. The women must sit together. Men must sit together. It’s an education. We, too, have [some men, problem] like that. Some are like that. Actually, it’s very funny. Everybody laughs at them. Very embarrassing. The husband running after the wife or the wife running after the husband, it’s very embarrassing. I mean, you are in any case married. What is there to run after? So much ado of the wife is very embarrassing. Or of the husband also is very embarrassing. Live like normal people. Now you have gone in a tour. It’s not a honeymoon trip. Not at all a honeymoon trip. It’s a trip for education ? education how to live with the group, how to live with each other, the other Sahaja Yogis. [Hindi/ understand?] So this is it.

Now for marriage, not for fun [any way, anymore]. Do not take any frantic steps. Marriage should be done in a very normal way. There should be no frantic here. Take it easy. Nothing has to be done extraordinary. If you like somebody, you can have the marriage. If you don’t get married this year, doesn’t mean you won’t get married next year. So don’t misunderstand. And Sahaja Yoga is a training and you’ll be [better]. When you have come here, you have not come here just to go round like tourist[s] or to save your money [in India] by coming down here. You have come here to educate yourself, in the aspects which are not [to be for your comfort].

Sahaja Yogi: [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [You] have to sit down. Men on this side, women on that side. Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: Make four groups. Four groups

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: We’ll make four groups.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. Two groups of women.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Ladies first. Two English for the group.

Sahaja Yogi: Ha, ladies first.

Shri Mataji: In India that...

Sahaja Yogi: In India, always ladies first.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Never.

Sahaja Yogi: Never.

Shri Mataji: Never eat. No woman will eat before her husband has eaten. Never.

Sahaja Yogi: So ladies are requested to make two groups.

Shri Mataji: Never. On the contrary, men are fed first of all there. They like to pamper their husbands, and husbands rest and I’ve told many, many times, this is the fact. Women do never eat even if you force them.

Sahaja Yogi: Woman will not take food till her husband took food, firstly. She will take after.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Then he must still get. Unless and until that all the menfolk have not eaten, the women won’t eat.

Sahaja Yogi: First husband, then wife.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Then for children. When they have all eaten the food then the women will sit down and eat their food.

Sahaja Yogi: She will sit alone. [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Sometimes she’s alone. So she eats alone.

Sahaja Yogi: So now, you will make two groups of ladies.

Shri Mataji: But if there are many [women also this is their place, many outputs]. But here once I told only in, [as I ] remember, we told someone there, that German girl. She came like Hitler [on us / or not]?

Sahaja Yogini: Oh, we thought that, yes. Yes.

Shri Mataji: You remember?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I do.

Shri Mataji: I told her that, “You better feed these men. They have to go out. Then you eat later on.” And she became like, just like Hitler. Can you believe it? She was so angry with Me for this. I just didn’t know that I have said something very wrong. We all do it all the time in India. And sometimes I feel, what’s the matter? We never feel we are oppressed or anybody is dominating us, nothing of the kind. How are they dominating? I mean, we are sensible people and we can look after them. They have to look after them. They are in charge of them. Yes, that’s what we think. Why do we think like that?

Sahaja Yogi: Because they haven’t got the ego, while Europeans have got the ego. They’ve got to [show/shout] that they are not only in charge of them.

Another Sahaja Yogi: Both, both of them, both of them.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but the women, you see, will fight with the husbands. “Why don’t you eat well? You must eat well. Have this food.” If he goes away without food then she won’t eat the whole day. “You must have your food.” She will prepare his bath. She’ll do everything. She’ll look after him. Like a child she treats the husband.

Sahaja Yogi: This is degrading for a, for a Western woman. In this country it is not.

Shri Mataji: Oh, it is very upgrading. For us it is upgrading. Why should it be degrading?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, because they still have a conditioning.

Shri Mataji: Aaa?

Sahaja Yogi: They still have ego.

Shri Mataji: Ego, ego. I mean, do you see, I don’t know...

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to give his bath.

Shri Mataji: Aaa?

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to give his bath.

Shri Mataji: Have patience, mummy, she gives you bath.

Sahaja Yogi: He likes this.

Shri Mataji: Very few.

Sahaja Yogi: Once in a week.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogis: Once in a week.

Shri Mataji: Just see that, concession’s coming forward.

Sahaja Yogis: Concession.

Shri Mataji: Now, I must say I’ve spoilt My husband completely.

Sahaja Yogi: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: My daughter says so. “You have really ruined him.” Even he says so. “I’m so ruined.” When I’m not there he’s shouting at the servants, shouting at everyone, and they say, “If You are not there, we are not going to stay near of him.” He says, “Nothing is all right. This is wrong, that is wrong.” He’ll throw his shirt this side, throw that. Then, I mean [we/I] really [spoil them, spoiled him]. And they also stay it forward, walk off. They don’t [go here and there/ hear anything]. They’ll look forward, but not this way, you see. It’s very different. I think the training it’s different. Your parents would have been like this. Grandparents would have been like this. So you are like this. But our parents have been like the other way round. So we have learned from them, we should say. But it doesn’t go to our heads, some of these things. I mean, if My husband says, “You come and eat food with me,” supposing, and there are five six guests are sitting, and I’ll say, “Who will make the rotis now, you are asking?” They say, “No, no, it’s all right. You just make them and bring them along.” But I’ll say, “No, it will become [burned/cold].” “It’s all right. Doesn’t matter. What is there? We’ll all eat together.” They will force on Me that we should eat together, and I’ll go on saying all the time, “No, no, no, let Me prepare.” [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: There, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Ha.

Sahaja Yogi: Ladies, please stand up. Go there and sit there [if you look].

Shri Mataji: This is My experience. In America I have decided that Western ladies should stay first. I don’t want to say [it so bumptious/ so on workshops]. I’m not saying it.

Sahaja Yogi: Makes them more conceited.

Shri Mataji: What?...
