Talk to Sahaja Yogis

[Missing part] After that she sat down at least. And then she said to Me, “Mother, I must say this Chaya, what must have she done in her last life to be married to a man like that?” After that she never took his side. Always she used to come and tell Me that, “Chaya told Me that he’s such a funny man.” She wants as soon as he comes in the room I should enter into the room. She says, “I feel shy.” I mean, [Hindi]. If they have no understanding then we [can’t, cannot] do anything. Do you feel shy? You shouldn’t do that. You really feel shy. I mean, there’s something like shyness. She said, “I find it impossible, you know, with this man. I feel very shy and I feel very embarrassed.” She wanted to, [see with/show] us some nice film, she wanted to see. So this fellow said, “No, you should only see it with me.” She said, “But you are not coming. If you come [then we’ll go together, I will not go out].” He couldn’t bear her going with other friends. Can you imagine? Such a jealous spot. [Hindi]

I mean, we are not complicated. In the same way, get rid of your complications. Like who will now get married. I mean, they must have arguing. That’s important. And they come out fighting, both of them. No one can sleep there. In that Brompton Square, can you imagine, that such a supposed to be spot place. Once I was there in the evening time. Who was with Me that day? None of you. He came out of that place, from Brompton Square. About twelve o’clock in the night we were going back. And one girl and one boy came out. Not girl and boy, quite old I would say, well the girl was about, and the boy was twenty-five, the girl was twenty-two or something. He was pulling her by her hair and she was beating him. I said, “What’s this going on?” He said, “We are married.” I said, “Really?” If they are married then they are supposed to fight. When they are not married they are supposed to love. It’s a funny junction. Find the absurdity? So you get out of this thing. This kind of madness, it’s not good.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s funny.

[Recording interrupted]

Shri Mataji: You see, Chaya told Me, he’s such a henpecked husband. This is we call as [Hindi/henpecked], who runs after the wife all the time. Looks funny, you know. Must have [also/ a] your self-respect.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: So one must develop a real style. It’s an education. It’s an education. The women must sit together. Men must sit together. It’s an education. We, too, have [some men, problem] like that. Some are like that. Actually, it’s very funny. Everybody laughs at them. Very embarrassing. The husband running after the wife or the wife running after the husband, it’s very embarrassing. I mean, you are in any case married. What is there to run after? So much ado of the wife is very embarrassing. Or of the husband also is very embarrassing. Live like normal people. Now you have gone in a tour. It’s not a honeymoon trip. Not at all a honeymoon trip. It’s a trip for education ? education how to live with the group, how to live with each other, the other Sahaja Yogis. [Hindi/ understand?] So this is it.

Now for marriage, not for fun [any way, anymore]. Do not take any frantic steps. Marriage should be done in a very normal way. There should be no frantic here. Take it easy. Nothing has to be done extraordinary. If you like somebody, you can have the marriage. If you don’t get married this year, doesn’t mean you won’t get married next year. So don’t misunderstand. And Sahaja Yoga is a training and you’ll be [better]. When you have come here, you have not come here just to go round like tourist[s] or to save your money [in India] by coming down here. You have come here to educate yourself, in the aspects which are not [to be for your comfort].

Sahaja Yogi: [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [You] have to sit down. Men on this side, women on that side. Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: Make four groups. Four groups

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: We’ll make four groups.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. Two groups of women.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Ladies first. Two English for the group.

Sahaja Yogi: Ha, ladies first.

Shri Mataji: In India that...

Sahaja Yogi: In India, always ladies first.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Never.

Sahaja Yogi: Never.

Shri Mataji: Never eat. No woman will eat before her husband has eaten. Never.

Sahaja Yogi: So ladies are requested to make two groups.

Shri Mataji: Never. On the contrary, men are fed first of all there. They like to pamper their husbands, and husbands rest and I’ve told many, many times, this is the fact. Women do never eat even if you force them.

Sahaja Yogi: Woman will not take food till her husband took food, firstly. She will take after.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Then he must still get. Unless and until that all the menfolk have not eaten, the women won’t eat.

Sahaja Yogi: First husband, then wife.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Then for children. When they have all eaten the food then the women will sit down and eat their food.

Sahaja Yogi: She will sit alone. [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Sometimes she’s alone. So she eats alone.

Sahaja Yogi: So now, you will make two groups of ladies.

Shri Mataji: But if there are many [women also this is their place, many outputs]. But here once I told only in, [as I ] remember, we told someone there, that German girl. She came like Hitler [on us / or not]?

Sahaja Yogini: Oh, we thought that, yes. Yes.

Shri Mataji: You remember?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I do.

Shri Mataji: I told her that, “You better feed these men. They have to go out. Then you eat later on.” And she became like, just like Hitler. Can you believe it? She was so angry with Me for this. I just didn’t know that I have said something very wrong. We all do it all the time in India. And sometimes I feel, what’s the matter? We never feel we are oppressed or anybody is dominating us, nothing of the kind. How are they dominating? I mean, we are sensible people and we can look after them. They have to look after them. They are in charge of them. Yes, that’s what we think. Why do we think like that?

Sahaja Yogi: Because they haven’t got the ego, while Europeans have got the ego. They’ve got to [show/shout] that they are not only in charge of them.

Another Sahaja Yogi: Both, both of them, both of them.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but the women, you see, will fight with the husbands. “Why don’t you eat well? You must eat well. Have this food.” If he goes away without food then she won’t eat the whole day. “You must have your food.” She will prepare his bath. She’ll do everything. She’ll look after him. Like a child she treats the husband.

Sahaja Yogi: This is degrading for a, for a Western woman. In this country it is not.

Shri Mataji: Oh, it is very upgrading. For us it is upgrading. Why should it be degrading?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, because they still have a conditioning.

Shri Mataji: Aaa?

Sahaja Yogi: They still have ego.

Shri Mataji: Ego, ego. I mean, do you see, I don’t know...

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to give his bath.

Shri Mataji: Aaa?

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to give his bath.

Shri Mataji: Have patience, mummy, she gives you bath.

Sahaja Yogi: He likes this.

Shri Mataji: Very few.

Sahaja Yogi: Once in a week.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogis: Once in a week.

Shri Mataji: Just see that, concession’s coming forward.

Sahaja Yogis: Concession.

Shri Mataji: Now, I must say I’ve spoilt My husband completely.

Sahaja Yogi: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: My daughter says so. “You have really ruined him.” Even he says so. “I’m so ruined.” When I’m not there he’s shouting at the servants, shouting at everyone, and they say, “If You are not there, we are not going to stay near of him.” He says, “Nothing is all right. This is wrong, that is wrong.” He’ll throw his shirt this side, throw that. Then, I mean [we/I] really [spoil them, spoiled him]. And they also stay it forward, walk off. They don’t [go here and there/ hear anything]. They’ll look forward, but not this way, you see. It’s very different. I think the training it’s different. Your parents would have been like this. Grandparents would have been like this. So you are like this. But our parents have been like the other way round. So we have learned from them, we should say. But it doesn’t go to our heads, some of these things. I mean, if My husband says, “You come and eat food with me,” supposing, and there are five six guests are sitting, and I’ll say, “Who will make the rotis now, you are asking?” They say, “No, no, it’s all right. You just make them and bring them along.” But I’ll say, “No, it will become [burned/cold].” “It’s all right. Doesn’t matter. What is there? We’ll all eat together.” They will force on Me that we should eat together, and I’ll go on saying all the time, “No, no, no, let Me prepare.” [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: There, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Ha.

Sahaja Yogi: Ladies, please stand up. Go there and sit there [if you look].

Shri Mataji: This is My experience. In America I have decided that Western ladies should stay first. I don’t want to say [it so bumptious/ so on workshops]. I’m not saying it.

Sahaja Yogi: Makes them more conceited.

Shri Mataji: What?...

Part 2
And here they have tried to establish how astrology is so correct and whatever is predicted fourteen thousands years back it is also today coming [back/up]. But this is about two thousands years back one of the great astrologers of this place, not Sholapur but little downward, Karnataka, he described about these things so clear-cut that I mean you will be amazed. That, he said that, “This Great Yogi will come on this earth, on the Mina Rasi, the Pisces.” So, I’m just on the cusp of the Pisces and the Aries, you see. But that’s not so important. Then he said so, says that gradually we’ll start seeing some miracles from 1964 to ’66. So he says that may be little bit. But he says, the, the real change, Manvantar in the age, the new age, He will start from 1970.

Sahaja Yogis: Ah!

Shri Mataji: And by 1980 it will take its grip. All right? That time by this new method, the new age will be formed and this, the old one, Vaivasta. You see, there’s one, another, we have yugas. One of the yugas will be over, and that yuga is in Kali Yuga. So that’s how Kali Yuga will be finished from 1970, will be start receding back, Kali Yuga. And a new age of active Divinity will start, Kruta Yuga. New age of active Divinity, Kruta Yuga will start. All right. That time, that time, the sun will rule in a new way, the sun. The axes of earth will be reduced, and the speed of the earth will be reduced, gradually. And that time a great Maha Yogi will be born who will be completely Parabrahma, completely Parabrahma. That’s Me.

Sahaja Yogi: Jagat Mata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki. Jay!

Shri Mataji: And He [unclear]. And He, He will possess all the powers, to do or not to do, to, [and / that] means Mahakali and Mahalakshmi, all the powers, all the powers. Before this, people used to go into bhakti, devotion, gyana, means reading, Patanjali Yoga and then they used to get their mokshas. But with this new method that this Maha Yogi will bring in, the pure power within you, in your chakras will rise, and as a result the Kundalini Shakti will be awakened and will be enlightening. Because of this new method of Maha Yoga you will see with your own eyes and you’ll get it in this body in your lifetime, the realization. And you’ll get the joy of realization. Imagine, two thousands years back. He’s greater than Blake, I must say.

Sahaja Yogi: What’s his name Mother?

Shri Mataji: His name was [Hindi], Bhujander, Bhujander Kaka, Kaka Bhujander. His name was Kaka Bhujander, Acharya Kaka Bhujander.

Sahaja Yogi: Acharya Kaka Bhujander Tattwachary.

Shri Mataji: Tattwachary, Tattwachary. You don’t have to sacrifice this body. Many people, great saints, sacrificed their body in living condition. They went into a cave and starved themselves and died. But that’s not necessary with this new method. I mean, you won’t die, either. Means you will achieve your Spirit. And the [Sakshatkari Santvara shabdakari ka sant] the realized souls, the saints who [are/have] realized, the Brahmananda, the joy of the Brahma, by this new Yoga. And they won’t have to go into Samadhi. Samadhi is where people just sit down, go on meditating for hours together and the ants grow up on them, and all that. It’s not necessary. Just without doing anything like that, they will get their realization, and they will enjoy the joy of Brahma.

Sahaja Yogi: Means the Sahaja Samadhi.

Shri Mataji: Ha, Sahaja Samadhi. This is Sahaja Samadhi, according to [you/him...] Among millions first one will get realization. So you understand your own positions. You see, the way sometimes we fritter away our attention in nonsensical things. You realize that among millions you are one. This is written here. We fritter away our attention in useless things like “my husband, my wife, my children, this that and that.” So it is written here that among millions one will be selected. Do you follow that point?

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Then the, all the human race can get over their death or their destruction by this yoga. You’ll have to lead a life, a married life, a normal life, yet may not [marry/be married] but like a normal householder. Otherwise, you cannot get this yoga [sthiti]. Like if you become a big saint, and a sadhu baba, or a guru, or something great [then] you cannot [get it]. You[’ll] have to be a normal householder. May be married, may not be married; it is not the point. [Samsari/Sansarik] means living on this earth, in the brass tacks, as you say.

Sahaja Yogis: The grass roots, grass roots, grass roots. Grass roots.

Shri Mataji: Grass roots. It’s grass roots. But brass tacks are there.

Sahaja Yogi: The brass tacks, yes.

Shri Mataji: Brass tacks.

Sahaja Yogi: That has to be English.

Another Sahaja Yogi: Down to the basics.

Shri Mataji: Down to the basics. I am getting American now.

Sahaja Yogini: But I think that’s British, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Is it? Is it?

Sahaja Yogini: I think brass tacks is British.

Shri Mataji: Now, what is the American for that?

Sahaja Yogini: I’ll have to think about that.

Shri Mataji: All right. Think it over.

Sahaja Yogini: I’ll tell You. Nitty-gritty.

Shri Mataji: Nitty-gritty? All right. Then all your diseases will disappear so fast with this yoga that you won’t need anything like a hospital.

Sahaja Yogis: Great. Great. Great.

Shri Mataji: In the beginning this great yogis, you people also, only by touching people you can cure people. It’s a fact.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Like the Ardhanari Nateshvara is the Shiva that will be [the state of/ this thing for] human beings. Their old age will disappear, their body will remain as it is and they will have a body which is divine. What a promise. So don’t worry too much about your bodily comforts, all right? Then [maybe/ may be ] some of you, if you want you can fly in the air also with that body. Also they can become subtle, and can enter into the body of [others?], that already you are doing. Enter into the body of others to get them cured. That already you are doing. They will not be touched by the fire and any weapons. Also you will be able to see these subtle things with your own eyes. You can see them. This will not only happen in India but all over the world. India is a country of great punyas. That’s why there are powers which will look after the protection of this country, and this country will gradually rise. He says that the third world war that was... When was that third?

Sahaja Yogini: We had two since now.

Sahaja Yogi: Second World War finished in ’45, Mother. Third world war...

Sahaja Yogini: May there be no more.

Shri Mataji: They may have to go for a third world war and they will have to suffer for it. After all, after that this great incarnation will interfere and all the countries will come together with the understanding of collective oneness. And they will understand that war is so horrible. In a very big ? I don’t know which one ? in a very big city a conference of all the countries will be held. There not the politicians but the yogis will direct them. Yogis. There, he calls you yogis throughout. This might be the third world war we had with China, maybe.

Sahaja Yogi: Korea. The Korean War?

Shri Mataji: Or maybe China because he says that because of [Chinese/ China’s] aggressive policies and the third world war we, we’ll have to bear lot of...

Sahaja Yogi: [Blain]?

Shri Mataji: No, lot of...

Sahaja Yogi: Responsibility?

Shri Mataji: No, no, you, you will have to bear lots of problems, you see, and these we’ll have to fill up the gaps in, but by true prayers we’ll be able to unite all the countries.

Sahaja Yogi: Could be the Vietnam War.

Shri Mataji: By the new inventions of science, the divine knowledge and the science will become one.

Sahaja Yogini: Great, Mother. That’s a miracle.

Shri Mataji: With the science we’ll be able to establish the existence of God and of [death/ the Spirit]. That is how there will be no difference. There will be coordination between the science and the, co-relationship between the science and the Spirit or, or the divine knowledge. Already we are getting it because, you see, on My photograph people get vibrations. It’s the science, you see. On the television, mantras, all that, if you start curing [people] through scientific methods, we’re also using the science for that purpose. You can prove that these things can be carried by magnetic forces, by sounds, by all these things. See, we can prove it. Then he says that because of ignorance and because of maya, yogis had to suffer a lot to become collectively conscious, [Brahmani], that to feel the Brahma. But now... and they had to do lot of penance. That was so difficult. Will become Sahaja. This is the word, Sahaja. Sahaja [Hindi]. Sahaja. And you don’t have to give up anything to achieve Brahma. In the new yoga system when it will manifest in the different countries, in the new age, the administration will be governed by people who have their own powers of yoga. Depending on how far you are in your yoga and their qualities as yogis, that will be the determining [point/fact]. They will be able to create a society which will completely fulfill their desires and their necessities, and people won’t need to have money accumulated with them. [Hindi] The poverty and sickness will be completely finished, and in their absence the country, the [ Samaj] the society will be healthy and restful and without any anger. And [they have / he has] described here about the China attacking India [now]. These are another places but this is a quite a good thing. They have also given the name of Jacqueline Murray. She is an American lady.

Sahaja Yogini: Ah?

Shri Mataji: Jacqueline Murray.

Sahaja Yogini: M U R...?

Shri Mataji: They don’t spell. This woman had [depicted / predicted] about Me. And she has said that, she has said that a great personality will be born in India, a lady. She said, about 1924. I was born in 1923. About correct, you see. But Cheiro has said that by 1980 the new, the new advent... [missing part]
