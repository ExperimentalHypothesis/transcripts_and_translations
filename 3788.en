Shri Mahalakshmi Puja, Kolhapur (India), 3 February 1984.
If you did not have Sushumna we would have been like animals only. Even animals have this channel up to a point. As you know they can come up to the void, but after the void the ascent as human being starts through this Mahalakshmi energy within us. So this energy is very important and that one is very much worshipped in this country. First this energy starts working within us as seeking – seeking shelter and food. Once the shelter is established, which is established through the Mahakali Shakti – I mean when it is in the heart of an animal sense of security is established, then he starts seeking food." ...
... "we had a very bad floods in Patna, and it was such a bad flood that people had to go in the upper storey and look after their security – that was the first thing. Which is such an innate feeling in human beings to preserve life and that comes from the Mahakali’s powers. And when they went up there, they told Me that they didn’t have food for 3 days but they had never thought of food. They never even thought they were hungry, they were only worried that the water may rise up to that point where they are and they’ll all sink and die. So the only worry was that how to exist, how to survive and the food question did not come. 
But when people starve, they also start thinking of insecurity, that they may die, and then they start thinking about food. So the first security comes in, then the second comes – the sense of food. In emergency the sense of food that comes, is the beginning, but later on we start putting our attention to food. Then the enjoyment of the food, then discrimination of the food and all those things, you see various things start coming into us and we get lost with this Mahalakshmi Tattwa."... ... "So whatever God gives us, whatever is there 'is good, vibrate it, and eat it'. "...
... "This is of course Mahalakshmi’s blessings that we think of food, but She doesn’t say that you get lost with it, so we get lost with it and once we are lost with it then our seeking doesn’t become higher." ...
... "So now the attention more goes towards the acquisition of better facilities for food, or better food, or whatever you may call for health food as you call it, and that also if you go too much, you see, you can touch the banks, but you shouldn’t cross over and walk through otherwise how will you move on the river? That’s the point is, so we start building up that sort of a nonsense also, this is good for health, this is not good for health, that is good for health, and health for what? For what is the health? Health is for having a good attention, which you don’t have, is lost in the food. ..."
... "then they think that, you see this kind - it works all the time, the insecurity part of it within, so, that this food could be lost, so what should we do to have better food? So they start thinking of money, so you know that the barter system became a system of money, people started having money. But then apart from food, clothing, other things started and people started moving with it to the Mahakali power more and more, and the creative power more and more. The banks are also becoming subtler and subtler, the movement is also become subtler and subtler. So as the man started moving higher and higher arts developed on the right side, and the idea of quality of life, or quality of security changed. So the both the sides becoming subtler and subtler and the growth becoming subtler and subtler, man gets again lost into those subtler banks on the right and the left. Still you have to move further. 
So the Mahalakshmi power takes you higher and higher, that time then you think you must express yourself and the expression starts in arts, culture, it starts also in your living, in your institutions of security, like political advancement, political institutions, and that’s how human beings reached a point where now they think they have done that was all possible, but still in a subtler way they are still lost. So the Mahalakshmi Tattwa went up to, say Christ – up to that point, and still people have not gone into the subtler side of that. They are still on the banks, moving towards the banks – not in the centre of it. In Sahaja Yoga what happens is that, the pure desire that is Kundalini is kept at the beginning of the life, just at the beginning of the life, when you were not even a human being, even below- this carbon and all the journey from carbon onwards is to be repressed again through the Kundalini. 
 All this journey that you did on the superficial level of this Mahalakshmi stream has to be redone in the innermost way to penetrate through all these subtler centres which are inside the stream – not outside. ..."
... "Even if you say that the Kundalini is the moving force, still where is your attention? Still your attention is on the banks. So you come up again superficially, you come and just float superficially and then again jump onto some bank, then again I’ll have to put you down inside the water, go inside, inside, again go back to the Kundalini, again start your journey. But from the very beginning, steadfast if you move towards the target, towards the spirit, then I have no problem but it doesn’t with human beings, they are so much used to the attraction of the banks that they always come up, float, go to the banks, and again sometimes settle down there, or again come back so the journey is upward-downward, downward-upward. Though the movement of the Kundalini could be such that you jump like a jet and set down there. The day that starts I’ll be the happiest person, because it is too much sometimes for Me to make this kind of a journey four times up and down with everyone because of the so called attachments they have outside. The inner movement with a detached mind, if they accept a situation and they decide within themselves that I’m going to do like this, I have decided on this, they can work it out. But it’s not so. Mostly the attitude should be that Mother is like a mirror, and we have a mirror in front of us so we know how we are proceeding." ...

... "But getting out of the Sahaja stream and doing something, is again coming out of that innermost channel of Brahma Nadi – outwards, again floating, going to the banks, again going down because every time you go down like that you have to start your Kundalini again back. It’s a very difficult thing. And the force of the Kundalini gets spent. So one has to understand that if you have to do this journey, you have to be a determined person, you have to be a disciplined person, yourself." ...
... "but even serious things should not attract your attention, your attention should be on the solution of all the solutions, blessing of all the blessings, the emancipation of all the emancipations. You shouldn’t worry about anything else, you just worry about 'that' connection which is being established and nothing else. Everything is looked after. It is as simple as that. If this connection is broken, the simple thing is to keep the connection on. What’s the use of polishing this, doing this, doing that, are you going to get the connection back? This is a simple practical thing we forget. And once we start forgetting that practical side we become retarded in our progress and what we find wherever we are we are there. Like in this Kolhapur I would say when I come, you will see tonight there will be a huge crowd, very huge crowd, always we have. Out of them how many really take up this journey? Very few. Doesn’t matter, you shouldn’t mind it because they are not wise yet. But those who become wise, who take up the journey also, in between jack in the box, they come out. Suddenly I find somebody floating, we are going through the submarine and they just jet out. This is how it has happened with all our journey, and at this place when we are, we have arrived here, not by plane, not by car, not by roads but through the innermost core of our heart we have arrived here. The Brahma Nadi we have arrived at Kolhapur, at Mahalakshmi’s point through the most innermost part and that’s how we are here. So we look at this place in a very gross manner, that’s our old habits but the new habit should be vibration-wise where are we, what is it. Once you develop this, I can definitely completely transform this Kolhapur into another place. You are like My channels." ...

 Today is a special day for all of you, is called as Mahabij महाबीज, the day of Mahabij, means all the mantras have a Bija and the Mahabija of that is Omkar himself, Omkar. And in the first place this Omkar was like an egg - Brahmand ब्रह्माण्ड. They call it Brahmand – the whole Brahma ब्रम्ह becomes an Anda [egg]. Of course when they say Brahmand even Sanskrit people don’t know that they are talking of an egg – Brahmand- the Anda of Brahma, that is the first Bija, and how this Brahma ब्रम्ह, this vibrations, how they were created. In the first place, when the Devi separated from Shiva, before that She had gone round Him as you know, and then Shiva told Her – Sadashiva told Her that You have to now create, and the separation took place, so He came out of that Pradakshina प्रदक्षिणा or you can call it elliptical form, and when He came out of it, that created a kind of a sound - sound that had this Brahma in it. So 'that Brahma' was left in that area. As I have told you that first the Devi went round Sadashiva and created a garland. That garland had covered Shiva in it, like the nucleus inside. But when Sadashiva went out of it, it created a sound and that sound filled the whole of that Andakruti अंडाकृती, means the form of an egg, and that is the MahaBija. That is the Omkara and that is reborn as Shri Ganesha and later on as Jesus Christ. That’s why at Mahalakshmi’s place come with Mahabija day is a very significant thing. Because Mahalakshmi was the mother of Jesus, Mary, and Her Son was the incarnation of Mahabija. So to come here on such and such date and to do Mahalakshmi’s Puja is a very big privilege, is a great privilege for all of you. And with that privilege you should humbly do this Puja and try to get into that Mahabija – become one part of that Mahabija, which is this Brahmand, the whole Brahmand, Brahma’s Anda – Anda means egg, is created. Be part and parcel of that and not to create any angularity or any kind of a misrepresentation but be homogeneous with the whole Brahma. One has to put attention to your Brahma Shakti which is manifested as vibrations. Today the vibrations are so great that I didn’t think I would be able to speak on this, but somehow I have managed. I hope you all have been able to understand the subtlest of subtle that I have talked to you today. So when you travel with Me you should not think that you have come here to see the whole land and all that, or to enjoy life. You have come here to become the channel of your Mother’s work. If you understand that, then you will be able to realize that God has given you a very appointed place. So I would request you – be deserving. Deserve it, and assume your seats, coveted places where God has put you.
May God bless you.
