Conversation, songs, with Shri Mataji, Cambridge, England, 24/03/1982

FIRST AUDIO

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Beautiful.

So, you hurried up too much. Will you have something to eat or not?

Sahaja Yogi: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You had your breakfast?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Sure?

So, I wanted to talk to you about France, the programs.

Oh God! What is it here? It's a tree! It's a tree, is it?

Sahaja Yogi: A very small tree.

Sahaja Yogi: The tape recorder, Mother.

Shri Mataji: For what?

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: William was very anxious just to hear you Mother; William who came back to France is anxious to know what-

Shri Mataji: You must get some tapes from Gavin, copy of tapes from Rustom are wonderful tapes there. Five tapes.

Sahaja Yogi: Rustom? I have.

Shri Mataji: Rustom. You've got? There are wonderful.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All about Christ and his place and all that, it's very good. They have sent Me these tapes about Christ and really, I was verifying [unsure] , I must say, as I couldn't bear these people having the thing called United Church.

They are uniting all kinds of bhoots and mesmeric people, all sorts! They had all kinds of false gurus, fake gurus, this, that in the name of church. I mean, this is even worse than having a church, isn't it? If there is only one bhoot, you can make it run away.

But this kind of a donkey stuff they are doing, I just can't really explain how they behave like that.

Yes, come in, come in, come in.

Hello.

So Marie, what are they doing these people? What work are they doing now? We are trying to expose.

Marie: They are trying to-

Shri Mataji: But, is it a church organization?

Marie: Not at all, it's completely outside of churches.

Shri Mataji: Independent.

Marie: Very independent.

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Marie: Some of the people are Catholics, some of the people are just-

Shri Mataji: But then who will attack Catholicism?

Marie: They won't, they won't.

Shri Mataji: That's it, you see? That's the point is, that's the basis of the whole thing.

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: That's the basis, you see. Because you see, if you allow one bad thing to continue, the others say: "What have we been doing? We are doing the same thing. Why should you have any objection?" You see? Like in India, there's one "adi guru"- he calls himself- Shankaracharya Arwe fellow. He wants to crown himself and he wants to have a crown and he wants to have a huge, big umbrella weighing tons, you know, with all the gold- what you call, jewellery and everything. Just think of it. Now, if somebody asks him: "Why do you want it?" He says: "What about Pope? Why don't you think of him? Pope does these things, he has got all the jewellery, this thing, that thing. And moreover, on top of that, what he says is the worse thing, that [inaudible] let the Christians here.

They said that at least our Rama, or Krishna wore the real gold stuff. But Christ did, wore only rags. Despite that these people are wearing the jewellery, so, I mean why can't I wear?" He says.

But he doesn't understand he is not Rama.

What to talk? What to say? You see, they are so stupid, you know, you just can't talk to them. And they are convinced with it. I don't know.

So, but you can get some writings from Australia. Australia, I'll let the Australians tell you what they have printed. So, their printing will help you to print in your, this thing. So you write to Warren and he'll send you all the things they have.

Marie: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Also my- somebody has got all the cuttings about Me where I have said this false guru, you should be careful, this thing.

Now, I must tell you a very good thing happened. The TM people here, in Cambridge, suddenly became aware of Jim's restaurant. The head of the department, who was a Dean once upon a time and a very powerful man, he came down to Jim's place. And he saw my photograph. So, he asked for a very special meeting of the TM and he sent invitations. So, Jim wrote to Me and I gave a bandhan and all that, and nobody turned out for the meeting. Not even a single soul. Can you imagine? Not even a single soul. So it's working out, no doubt, at that level, at a very subtle level. It's working out, no doubt.

Yesterday, it was very cold there.

How do you like the house? Yet, it's all removed and, John? He's not putting back in proper places.

Sahaja Yogi: It's vibrated.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: It's vibrated with John, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Isn't it? It's very blissful. Colleen is very nice. You should see the whole house.

Marie: It's quite amazing.

Shri Mataji: Hum? It's very subtle. You know this, I got this from where? Actually, I saw this-

Sahaja Yogi: Which John did you want, Mother?

Shri Mataji: The other one. He took it out and he's not placed it back, you see.

Marie: I think he has just gone out. He went out to see someone.

Shri Mataji: Somebody, to repair the front door.

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It's all right, let him come back. So, you see, what happened, that I went to see one place created by one Georgian artist called Adam, architect, very famous. And he had these, he had all these designs. So, I came back and I design it myself this, on the same lines. They have come quite near that. And then we copy, then the fellow was here he copied it and he made it.

But, if you want to see that place, I think it's overdone. Ours is not so much, a little bit. So, I think the French should like it because they don't like too much.

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: So, what is happening to France?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, we have prepared everything, when we come back Mother, to start programs next to the place of Nathalie because it's a very, very light and very nice place. And also we have prepared some programs in Paris. And we-

Shri Mataji: What is the program?

Sahaja Yogi: When?

Shri Mataji: What is the program.

Sahaja Yogi: We have tried to make one program each fifteen days, so we have time to make a proper advertisement. Because last time we found out that [when] we have programs each week, there were very few people and they were not very well organized. So we try to put our attention more and advertise.

Shri Mataji: What you do, I tell you. In the Western countries, though they are so affluent, they are very fond of food and entertainment. Indians are not, you see, though we are poor, we are satisfied. I think those who are satisfied are born in India, perhaps.

What you have to do - I got a hint from Christine, you see. We have to learn from each other! [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

What you do, you call them for a weekend and that we'll have music and will have dinner and also we'll have some dogs, the whole day they can spend there. At a weekend. If you ask them to travel somewhere, they like it, first of all. And secondly, you must call them for dinner. They'll be very happy and anxious to do it. But if you just call them for the programs, they are not interested. You see, they are still so gross and so materially sort of- you see, I'm surprised that in affluent countries, people should be so fond of food, it surprises Me. But they are. The more they become affluent, it's like drunkards, you know: once they start drinking, they just want to have more drinks, it's something like that. I mean, the Western people are much more materialistic than Indians are though we are poor people or maybe that temperamentally we are like that. We are satisfied people, aren't we?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You have seen them [In India].

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, very much.

Shri Mataji: You must not have seen any Indian eating anywhere.

Sahaja Yogi: They are very satisfied. They are very loving people.

Shri Mataji: They would get up in the morning, arrange everything for these people for food, everything and you would not see them eating anywhere, sitting down and eating. Serving, looking after you, giving you food, arranging things, running about, but you will never see them sitting down suddenly. But if the - Western people will suddenly rush and sit down on their things and start eating [onomatopoeia].

It is a [inaudible] thing, I must ask Cristine. First, I never knew that you are not satisfied people. As far as food is concerned, after a certain age, a person should be satisfied. Say, when you are young, say about five, six years, seven years, one feels like that. But then they grow, you see, and then you don't all the time ask for food, food, food, food, food, so important! It's not so. So this point, you must remember. And Christine has sent Me a hint that if you can call people- Hi John!

Sahaja Yogi: Hello Mother.

Shri Mataji: If you could call people for food and for some entertainment then they'll be there. But if you just say you are coming for programs, they are not interested. They are not interested in programs. And thirdly, my lectures maybe the third position, maybe. The first, food, second entertainment, third, my lectures. So you put my lectures.

Sahaja Yogi: In the last part, when the belly is satisfied. [Laughter.]

Shri Mataji: They are like children still, they are not grown-ups. I tell you now, I've discovered when Christine gave Me a hint that, you see, I was, I never knew this that they are so fond of food. That Western people are so fond of food when they have affluence they are such children still wanting to eat more and more. And if they have food, you see this. We never think of food!

Sahaja Yogi: The house will be open one afternoon, a day per week and a weekend also to any person who is interested and we will share our life and our meals. So...

Shri Mataji: No, no, you have a group meal business. All of them, all the Sahaja Yogis, at least, must be with you that they are going to celebrate Mother's birthday or something, delayed action doesn't matter, but we'll have food, you see.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, OK.

Shri Mataji: Cheese you can have for the French.

[Laughter.]

They have two hundred types of cheese but still, they go for one cheese! All right, so you have something to eat and something entertainment then you can give them the lectures. I tell you they are still children compared to Indians.

We are not interested in food, we are not! By the time we have our- even children in India are not interested, you have to run after them with the plate in your hand: "Eat, eat, eat." They won't eat. Just they don't eat. You ask any father, mother in India, they'll have one problem: "Still they don't eat what to do?" Just don't eat.

Here I have seen that I used to think it's only one or two, but if it's a common thing that people will just come and eat this thing, that, they come from there, eat, properly done. No question, in India.

Now, the servant, look at him.

Sahaja Yogi: He does not eat very much.

Shri Mataji: He, you see, you give him anything, it's lying there. He will not eat, I will not eat, C.P. will not eat. We just don't eat anything.

But, I've seen that with Western people you just lay it down, it's finished. You see, you have to finish [inaudible] it's just finished.

It's a thing, you see, it's a, I think it's the mind perhaps, maybe.

Sahaja Yogi: They are not satisfied inside, so.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: So we know that when we eat we are-

Shri Mataji: I think it's just nervousness.

Maire: It's desiring something and not knowing what you want. So you take the most obvious thing which is food. Or you know what you desire but you don't want to go for it because it requires more discipline. And instead of -

Shri Mataji: No, but we don't put any pressure on ourselves. Automatically, Marie, I tell you, it is automatic. We don't put any pressure. I mean if we get food well and good, if we don't get doesn't matter.

But sort of it's not such an important thing for us to have food.

It's more respect, more manners. Manners are very important in India. Say, if you are unmannerly then a person will think as if he has been stumped, you see. If somebody says you are unmannerly, it's the worse thing that you can say to an Indian. So if you eat like this and it's regarded also as unmannerly in India. I think you've developed this. I've seen my grandchildren now just don't eat, just don't eat at all. You give them anything, you give them chocolates, you give them this, they'll throw it. 
Very little. Maybe, they like some icecreams sometimes. So, I get some icecreams for them. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] That's all I think, nothing much. 

But I think this eating also comes as nervousness. They don't know what they are seeking and they start eating food. Then entertainment. So do it: first of all food, then entertainment, then my lectures. And then Realization. Also, they are some people who will just listen to the lectures, they'll say: "I just want to listen, that's all." The desire is up to that point, then finished. 

This is India, is it? You are all so much tanned. Sahaja Yogini: Our liver Mother. Shri Mataji: Now, you are tanned with liver, is it? [Laughter] [Inaudible] Sahaja Yogini: It's true. Shri Mataji: In India, it was very bad. Sahaja Yogini: But I also get tanned very fast, Mother - I try never to go in the sun because I don't like it. But even I get tanned very fast. Shri Mataji: That's liver. Liverish personality. Oh God! This liver business is too much. So, stop eating cheese, absolutely. For liver, I don't know what to do but left to the right is a good idea for liver, very good idea. And don't think too much. You still think too much. I think Lord's prayer will help you. If you say Lord's prayer, Agnya will be balanced. If Agnya is balanced- there's not a single photograph which I can say is like Christ, to save. 

Sahaja Yogi: We bought from India a picture where we see only the nose and your Agnya. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogi: There is a big picture, in India, of You. We see only your eyes and your Agnya. You know, like that, just like that. And we put it in the meditation room. 
Shri Mataji: Only my eyes. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, and your forehead.
Shri Mataji: Is it? I have not seen that. 

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I have pictures Mother from India. From Alex? Shri Mataji: [In Hindi] Marie: Your glasses? Shri Mataji: Glasses. Who are these? Sahaja Yogi: Destandey's daughters Mother and Patricia. Shri Mataji: Hum? Whose's daughters? Sahaja Yogi: Bestanday's daughters. Shri Mataji: Who was? Sahaja Yogi: Mister Deshpande Shri Mataji: Deshpande. Deshpande was a big [?] Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I know. Shri Mataji: This is tremendous, you see? These photographs are even improving gradually I see I'm showing myself. I just bring my spectacles. [Shri Mataji leaves the room.]

[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: I was very tired in Delhi birthday. We used to have so many programs and it was nice.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I was wondering, would you like to be taken in video during your trip?

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: Would you like to be taken in video film during your trip of Europe?

Shri Mataji: Video film, when?

Sahaja Yogi: When you are going in Europe, this year.

Shri Mataji: Video film, all right, let's see. I have no objection to anything.

[Inaudible.]

Shri Mataji: Oh, you saw this?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it's Walt Disney, Indians [inaudible] It's spiritual Disney Land Mother.

Shri Mataji: Where was this? Where was this picture?

Sahaja Yogi: In a big kind of museum we can say -

Shri Mataji: In Dehli?

Sahaja Yogi: Not in Dehli, no. Where there are all the saints.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see, I see. Yes, they said: "You must see that and " I never go there. Yes.

Very tired ...

This is a very good photograph, you see, it's got the whole image of [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi: These are baptised by the water and the sitar is like this playing, [laughter] it was very nice, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You enjoyed yourself, hey?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

It was much more deep this year.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: I had a deeper experience this year in India.

Shri Mataji: Ah, very good.

Sahaja Yogi: I felt more, I felt more vibrations.

Shri Mataji: Where is it, the difference?

Sahaja Yogi: It is when we went to this temple, we went to a big temple Mother.

Shri Mataji: Ah, ah. They gave you the cool [inaudible] Kolhapur.

Sahaja Yogi: Kolhapur [unsure].

Shri Mataji: It is the same Disney Land.

Sahaja Yogi: Disney Land. Yes spiritual.

Shri Mataji: Very few Indians- foreigners must have gone there, to this Disney Land, you know.

Sahaja Yogi: It's very funny to fish, you go out and-.

Shri Mataji: Yes, there're very few have gone there.

All of these photographs of [?] have got something, a special expression. Disney Land, I've not been there.

Sahaja Yogi: This one is wonderful.

Shri Mataji: How did you get these colours? I never got a shawl like this, of this colour.

Sahaja Yogi: It was in Dehli, Mother.

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: Father, mother. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] C.P. was laughing really, he should see these also. He would say: "What are these? [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: It was a wonderful marriage. [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: Everybody watching them, you know, in the streets.

Where was that? Haldi.

So much of mirth and happiness and joy for everyone.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have learned a song from India. Shall we sing it to you?

Shri Mataji: All right, sing it. Indian song? It's an Indian or an English song?

Sahaja Yogi: It's an Indian Mother.

Shri Mataji: Now, what're the words?

Sahaja Yogis [Marathi, 2]:

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

Mataji nchya sange badha bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange badha bi ghadali

Badha bi ghadali Prakashamaya zhali

Badha bi ghadali Prakashamaya zhali

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Matajinchya sange Dharma bi ghadala

Matajinchya sange Dharma bi ghadala

Dharma bi ghadala Vishwa Dharma zhala

Dharma bi ghadala Vishwa Dharma zhala

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: You've got it very well. You can see-

It's a very sweet song, isn't it? It's a written by -

Look at that one, what is he doing?

Sahaja Yogi: He's cutting the trees there.

Shri Mataji: He is cutting the trees?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. A little branch and after it will go there again.

Shri Mataji: On my God.

So, this song, you know the meaning?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It's a double meaning. "Bi ghadalo" means "spoiled", we got spoiled, you know, the dharma got spoiled and we became the dharma of the universe, you see. The religion got spoiled and we became the religion of the universe, like that. It's very a double meaning, it's beautiful and written by Tukaram. Now, you have seen his picture, yes.

Sahaja Yogi: Tukaram!

Shri Mataji: Yes!

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I'm very pleased to learn a song from him, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It is a- at the end, his name come in, but they have not put it in this one. Because [inaudible] for Mataji. But it is Tukaram who has sung this. So, you have seen his film, you remember his film in Pune?

Sahaja Yogi: So nice, Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's a very beautiful film. You remember Nathalie, that film of Tukaram?

Nathalie: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: The same one has written this song "amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana" that "I am spoiled so you also get spoiled". And it has a double meaning "bi ghadalo". Also means the sea has taken its form "bi ghadana", the sea has taken its form and you also do it. Just like that.

Very straightforward, simple words but very deep, you see. Who taught you this one?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, before we were leaving, I had some Indian to sing some songs and write the words.

Shri Mataji: My sister sang this song. Did you tape her?

Sahaja Yogi: What happened, this night [inaudible] and something happened and we lost it. This tape has been lost.

Shri Mataji: But some people must have it.

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe Douglas, because he's not ready yet. Maybe, Douglas- Malcolm has recorded everything from you from India.

Shri Mataji: Yes, so he must have got it, yes. He must have got it, Douglas.

(British) Sahaja Yogi: This tape, we have it.

Shri Mataji: All right, so. And this-

Marie: Mother?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Marie: I know you said that the Goddess doesn't understand French but there's some beautiful song to the Virgin Mary, in France.

Shri Mataji: No, you sing that, that I understand.

Marie: That, you understand.

Shri Mataji: They look so nice. You see this?

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, yes Mother, beautiful.

Shri Mataji: You see, before a song starts, it has vibrations, you know. So, I understand that. Those I understand, not the language.

Marie: Can we sing to you Mother?

Shri Mataji: Please.

Marie: It says: Mother, be the queen of our home, be the queen of our country.

Shri Mataji: Now, say it.

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, you have seen this film.

Shri Mataji: We have seen this? Oh, I see. OK. Has this come today?

Marie: Yes, Allan brought it.

Shri Mataji: Allan?

Marie: I think so.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Sahaja Yogini: Also Madhama [unsure] from Canada was gone this morning.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Sahaja Yogini: Marc, [unsure] from Canada. He went this morning and he left a letter for you.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

Sahaja Yogini: He had to go back to Canada.

Shri Mataji: They have taught you all this?

Sahaja Yogi: No, from the tapes Mother.

Shri Mataji: Which tape?

Sahaja Yogi: From the tape from India, Mother.

Marie: We asked somebody to record for him.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Sahaja Yogi: This has been recorded from Rahuri.

Shri Mataji: From Rahuri.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. And I listen to it this morning at five.

Marie: [Inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi: This is more simple but for the others, we have got the words written by

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. It's Purna Kadambe, ne? "Kadamba" means lotus, "purna" means a "complete lotus" it's a beautiful combination of words, I don't know how they get it. It's very surprising. But [Inaudible] must come out very well I must say.

What are these playing with the children?

Sahaja Yogi: This playing?

Marie: No, it is this playing with the children.

Shri Mataji: What are they playing now?

Sahaja Yogi: With a kind of- I don't know-

Marie: Cymbals.

Shri Mataji: In the school. He has pushed receptions in the school, you know? Very good reception in the school. And such huge grounds, just think of it and think of other places, you see. I mean, you can see very clearly the difference. We spend so much time here and I don't know what is the outcome.

Marie: It's slow.

Shri Mataji: Very slow. You know Marie, now I have been doing this for ages, I should say. Eight years have passed. How much time did we have spent in India, do you know? I started about seventy, I came here in seventy-four, January means three years. And here eight years, can you believe it? What can you do, I mean, with these people? Three years only I worked there [in India] and people are so simple, they want to get it and they work it out. I don't know how to explain all this.

Sahaja Yogi: They see everything from their hearts.

Shri Mataji: Yes, there is, of course. I mean here, the people are very complicated, I think. Even Australians are better. Australian, it is – you see, that's like, it is more like people are simple. Here it's complex many complexes you know with them, [unsure] so complex that I don't know. What do they think of themselves? Such a complex system is there, to accept such a complex system itself is wrong. To say that you are this, you are that, I mean I don't know. Where have you reached with these complex things?

Sahaja Yogi: We always, when we see something, we try to intellectualize. It always starts from there.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that's it, very true, no doubt.

Sahaja Yogi: To judge everything with there.

Shri Mataji: But to intellectualize what? What are you intellectualizing, you see? What I don't understand is what is there to intellectualize? Can you intellectualize the sprouting of a seed? Say, for example. Can you intellectualize? Human beings can't do anything. Can you explain why the flowers have come like this or intellectualize? It's stupid to intellectualize about that is living. You cannot intellectualize, you see? You can only do it about the dead things. But about living things, how can you say? Can you explain why a flower takes such a shape, can you explain? How? How? How? Tell Me. Anything you cannot explain how. I mean you can't even create a stone, leave alone anything else. Let living thing alone, you can't create even a matter, not even a stone? Can you create even a stone with intellectualization? So what do you get? It's nothing but complications, it's imagination it's not reality. You see, imagination is imagination and reality is reality.

It's very simple but people don't understand, you see, why- how can you intellectualize anything, I just can't understand.

It's very difficult to let them see this point, this simple point that living things cannot be intellectualized. That makes you really stupid [Andre?] you really become stupid. Absolutely stupid, you know, to my mind, it is stupidity. To my mind, if I see- actually, I don't know what to say, I mean, how to explain? You are intellectualizing something which you cannot intellectualize. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] That's all. What do you say? Stupid! What's the word for that kind of folly?

Marie: It spoils your life completely.

Shri Mataji: I mean, an unnecessary waste of time and an unnecessary waste of energy for nothing at all. It's all imagination, sitting down and intellectualizing, I mean it's a mental activity, nothing constructive about it. Why waste? Why waste your energy? This is the thing I don't understand.

This one is nice (photo).

You see, the main thing is, that a great thing that has happened. At least, I can communicate, penetrate into that, at least. This has happened. But now, how many I am going to get you out of this intellectualized electrolyzed people, I don' know. They are jumping all the time. They are jumping so much that it's impossible.

Marie: Mother, the main way is if people feel they're loved.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Marie: If people feel that they are loved. It's only if their heart opens.

Shri Mataji: They feel they are all right. Have you seen?

Marie: No, no.

Shri Mataji: They feel- No, but just ask them if they feel that they are complete. They feel they have found out the meaning of what they are. Have they? Just ask them.

This is stupid, they are stupid persons only think like that. It's a sign of great stupidity, believe Me, that to feel "I'm all right." you see? You are even thinking till you say "I'm all right." Means what? You must say: "It's stupid". Are they all right? You think so? Anybody who can say that they are all right.

This one is very nice (photo).

[Cut in the audio]

[No sound for a couple of minutes.]

Shri Mataji: This one is beautiful. One is better than the other, nothing to change. [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Just think of Me, I mean, how much talk to these people? They don't want to get their Realization they don't want. Then, how am I to talk to them. I mean, without Realization, how will they understand about Me? And if I say I am this and that, supposing I say like that, then they'll start getting angry with Me. So it's a very vicious circle, I tell you, this intellectualized business [unsure], like electrolyzed people going round and round and round like mad. They don't want to stop and they think they are all right. That's the worse part of it, you see, they are going directly to Hell.

They don't even think they require cleansing. 

Like John told Me [unsure], he's better now but the father does not want to recognize. Sahaja Yogis said: "You should have been all right and the [inaudible] also." So we taught Sahaja Yoga no doubts, I mean that is awareness, All-pervading Power that you have to feel it, you have to be born again. What about that part? Now, Mister Pope is coming [inaudible] That means he is going to see – what is a queen and a king?

Yesterday, you see, when the king and all of them came up, I did not stand. I just did not stand. He said: "What has happened?" I said: "[inaudible] Mister. Why should I just stand for you people out there [unsure]?" I just did not stand.

Especially Miss Gandhi [Indira] was there. But she is a thief, you see. How can you stand for a thief? I know she is a thief, I cannot stand up from my seat, I said: " How can I stand up for her." People just stand up.

[Inaudible sentences.]

... I tried and tried I am not going to stand up for them. Who are they? You know, they are not [inaudible]. In the kingdom of God, where will they be? She's such a big thief Miss Indira Gandhi, such a cheat, horrible woman. She is making money on that poor country. Why should I just stand for her? Such a [inaudible] woman.

I like the king, he's all right. But, I mean, I did not stand up for her. She's a thief all right, that's all.

You see, I went to see Nizamuddin Auliya, a Realized soul whose tomb is there. And the king, you see, the emperor, somebody's there. The emperor, you see, he must have come. He wanted, you see, to make him come to salute. He said: "No, I will not. I will not salute." And he got so angry that he said to the saint that: "If you don't come" - Is it?

Marie: [Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Who can do it?

So, you see, he said: "You have to come." So, he said: "No, I cannot. I don't want to come to bow to you. I'm not doing that." So, he sent an order that "if you don't bow to me, like tomorrow, I'll cut your neck." You see, the neck will be cut out. And that night, he was murdered, the king, the so-called king was murdered.

The saint doesn't bow [Inaudible]. The saint has to sit. [Inaudible].

But I am the same [unsure] of the saint why should I stand up?

Shri Mataji: Rustom.

Sahaja Yogi: Rustom, Mother? Nice brother.

Shri Mataji: He's a great Sahaja Yogi, isn't it?

Sahaja Yogi: I spent my last night by this musician, this sitar musician, I don't remember his name, from India.

Shri Mataji: Ravi Shankar.

Sahaja Yogi: Not Ravi Shankar, another one. We went to Patricia also, they know, they met Patricia.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I know.

Marie: Debhuka.

Sahaja Yogi: And we went to these classes of this kind of Bangali 's dances, the girls were dancing very smoothly. Not heavy, not heavy like us.

Shri Mataji: [Inaudible part ]. You didn't see them dressed.

Sahaja Yogi: No, it was lovely, a lovely ballet [unsure].

[No conversation for 3 minutes]

Shri Mataji: [Inaudible part].

You can put it off. [Cut in the audio]

58:35

Sahaja Yogini: Are you sending us an English Sahaja Yogis to Paris?

Shri Mataji: I wish I could if there was some job for them.

Sahaja Yogini: What is it about Gregoire, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Gregoire? No, Gregoire is going away to- what's the place. Gregoire is going away to Bonn, Bonn, for about three years he'll be in Bonn and he hates it because of his in-laws there.

Marie: But he's not, normally he's not there officially, is he?

Shri Mataji: Not yet, but he said soon. But, he would like to go somewhere else. He said: "If I go to Vienna, I don't mind, anywhere but not in Bonn." That's one place he hates.

Shri Mataji: What did she say?

Marie: She wonders why he was not in Rome any longer.

Shri Mataji: Rome?

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: When was he not there?

Marie: Because she didn't know that he was finishing at the end of March.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Marie: Gregoire.

Shri Mataji: Yes. We have opened an account now, both of us together for the building. We have started now for the building in India. You see, there are three buildings we have to build and all of us must contribute, anything that is possible, you see. So, I said, a minimum of hundred pounds one should contribute in a year. But that's so minimum, I mean, we'll make no money, a hundred pounds is nothing. But still, a minimum of a minimum one hundred pounds, one year is not much.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Marie: Which buildings, Mother? 
Shri Mataji: We have got now a very beautiful plot of land in- or maybe of three lands in Bombay. One of them is the land which is a beautiful place on top of a mountain from where you can see three [inaudible]. It's very near to Bombay, it's a beautiful place. That we have got for free. We have got two lands free and one we have paid for it, a government land. 

[Shri Mataji is working on someone.] 
Shri Mataji: John, what has happened? 
John: I am just [inaudible] Mother. It's about ten to eleven, right? 
Shri Mataji: Hum. John is doing very well. Only thing, his Vishudhi should improve. You know, I was coming on the steps and suddenly my right Vishudhi twisted. Here is [laughter] Really! And C.P. said: "What happened? Are you going to fall?" I said "no". Since Vishudhi, you see, when I- look at the sensitivity of my body also, if you are a Realized soul. If C.P. has a bad Vishudhi, I don't feel. But if John has, I feel it. 
How is it, John, with this? What's the matter? 
John: I am [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Not yet. 
John: Not yet. 
[Shri Mataji is laughing.] 

Sahaja Yogini: Mother? Shri Mataji: Yes. Sahaja Yogini: I have a point here Mother and I can't get rid of it. Shri Mataji: Just sit. What do you have? Sahaja Yogini: It always gets blocked here. 

You'd better leave, she won't come, eleven-thirty is worse. She might come; give a bandhan.

Better. What's the matter here? Marie: I don't know, I can feel it rises and then it starts descending [inaudible]. Shri Mataji: That means it is a left Vishudhi, "ne"? It is a left Vishudhi, you should cure it. Marie: It's a very exact spot, Mother, it's a very precise spot. 

Shri Mataji: Are! [Conversation in Hindi.] 
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much. 
This is Radesh's wife. 
Shri Mataji: This you put this thing in such a container that doesn't require much water. 
It's left Vishudhi. 

You see, this is too much these people are trying to be too much, there is not even one person Madrasis, you see, and nobody appreciated. And all the Satajis were laughing. [In Hindi] Indian Sahaja Yogini: Especially vocal music. Shri Mataji: [In Hindi]. But best would have been to have instrumental. Indian Sahaja Yogini: Flute. Shri Mataji: [In Hindi]. South Indian dancing, that would have been much better than this music of Shubah Lakshmi. And she's not such a singer I tell you. She's not a great musician. What it is, she's good for bhajans and all that. She started first time, singing Hindi bhajans. So, people started to appreciate. But nothing great compared to what we have, talents. Sahaja Yogi: Excuse-me, Mother, Gregoire, he wants to know if he can take your darshan. Shri Mataji: Who? Sahaja Yogi: Gregoire, he wants to know if he can take your darshan tomorrow at eleven o'clock. Shri Mataji: All right. Better? Sahaja Yogini: Sometimes it's very painful. 

[Conversation with Sahaja Yogis in English and in Hindi while eating. Music in the background.]

Shri Mataji: So, if you don't mind I'll talk to her for a little while. You go and have a look at the house and you can hear the music everywhere.

SECOND AUDIO [track n°4]

 [The first five minutes are the same as on the first audio] 

Shri Mataji:..Such a complex system is there, to accept such a complex system itself is wrong. To say that you are this, you are that, I mean I don't know. Where have you reached with these complex things? 
Sahaja Yogi: We always, when we see something, we try to intellectualize. It always starts from there.

You see, imagination is imagination and reality is reality. It's very simple but people don't understand, you see. So, can you intellectualize anything, I just can't understand. 
It's very difficult to make them see this point, this simple point that living things cannot be intellectualized. That makes you really stupid [Andre? Inaudible], you really become stupid. Absolutely stupid, you know, to my mind, it is stupidity. To my mind, if I see- actually, I don't know what to say, I mean, how to explain.

This one is nice (photo).

You see, the main thing is that there are great things that have happened. At least, I can communicate, penetrate into that, at least. This is has happened. But now, how many I am going to get you this intellectualized [inaudible] five people, I don' know. They are jumping all the time. They are jumping so much that it's impossible.

Marie: Mother, the main way is if people feel they're loved. Shri Mataji: Hum? Marie: If people feel that they are loved. Internally their heart opens. Shri Mataji: They feel they are all right. Have you seen? Marie: No, no. Shri Mataji: They feel- No, but just ask them if they feel that they are complete. They feel they have found out the meaning of what they are. Have they? Just ask them. You see, stupid, they are stupid persons only think like that. It's a sign of great stupidity, believe Me, that to feel "I'm all right." you see? You are even thinking till you say "I'm all right." Means what? You must say it's stupid, are they all right? You think so? Anybody who can say that they are all right. This one is very nice (photo). 

5:04

You see, I've seen what happens if people take with the lens, then the one portion of the body looks big and one small.

[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: I mean if you are here, I'll be quite free for you. Tomorrow morning I'll be much freer than this. Today, you see, I've got some things to be bought, this, that. You see so many things are left out in this house which need to be tidy, I don't know. It's a man's house. It has come out well. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.] Sahaja Yogi: This musician, Mother, gave me an address of a man in Paris who is playing the tablas. Shall I start some? Shri Mataji: Who gave you? Marie: Debhu Shadhari. Sahaja Yogi: Devudsha. I don't know, maybe he's not a good fellow, I don't know. Marie: Debhu gave him the address of somebody. Shri Mataji: They'll be very expensive though. But doesn't matter, we can learn if you want. Marie: I can always go and ask. Shri Mataji: Yes. In India, it would be much cheaper to study, but, next year we'll do something about it. Because, you see, Baroda? I wanted to go to stay in Baroda [Gujarat]. Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. 

Shri Mataji: Baroda has a very big university of music and everything: dance, music, art, everything. So you can stay with them and it will be easier you see. Sheh is going to start an ashram in Baroda. So, it would be easier for you to learn all this. 
You should also go, I think. [To others]
Sahaja Yogi: One year in Baroda. The twin brothers excited [laughter]
Shri Mataji: Yes. I was telling you, you should make some money here and then go. 

The kind of door you have in your- for your first wardroom, in the drawing-room when you enter in a huge, big wardroom, that kind of a door, what is it called? That kind of design. 
Marie: It's a sort of country type of furniture. 
Shri Mataji: Is it? 
Marie: Yes. It's a traditional country style. 
Shri Mataji: It's country, it's not regency style. Not sophisticated. 
Sahaja Yogini: Country style. 
Marie: I's traditional country style.
Shri Mataji: Very robust. 
Marie: Yes, very robust. 
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]
Marie: It has to be. 
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]
Shri Mataji: No, you see, what? I was thinking if Me and CP we are making one cupboard. So, now I think I'll give up, in one week I get it here, it's quite nice. Then, another thing he wanted, CP, very "petite" [French word meaning "small"] chairs that you get in France, with a simple design on it. A sort of, that kind of people's seat they have mostly. 
Marie: Well, small chairs. 
Shri Mataji: Not small. But chairs, "petite" chairs you see, which have thin legs, French chairs and all that. You see, they have very thin legs and things. So if you could find out some shops. 
Marie: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: Or maybe Lille would be better. 
Marie: Paris has a lot of furniture, lots of lots. 
Shri Mataji: You know it's very expensive to go to even [?]. But some place, if you could find out where you can get a second hand.
[Some noise.] 
Shri Mataji: Rustom! 
A "chaise longue", and one, two chairs and a little, you know, it's very "petit" thin legs, that sort of things.
Maire: So it's very delicate. 
Shri Mataji: Delicate, sorry. 
Marie: So you would want how many chairs? 
Shri Mataji: Two chairs. 
Marie: Two chairs and a "chaise longue". 
Shri Mataji: And a "chaise longue", yes. Two chairs and maybe a little "setty" two "setty" [unsure]. You see, we have one room like that, all right? 

And another room that we have upstairs, you see, is only this much, we can't put in a big, big sofa's set there.

[Inaudible] Shri Mataji: What is it you're catching? Sahaja Yogi: Liver? Shri Mataji: Both things have come up here, you see? Sahaja Yogi: Oh, yes. I [Inaudible] when I was young, you see. I fall on the head and I opened my head. I always had that those two. Always. [Laughter] Mother, I wanted to ask you, Kay and her husband have arrived in here. Shri Mataji: They are coming here? Sahaja Yogi: No, they just [inaudible] because Kay has got something in England she's going to take back. They just came to visit and Shri Mataji: But they'll be here for a week at least. Then, I'll see them later. A little later this week. Just, this week is a little thing because of this Indira Gandhi being here, you see. This timeline, that time, these things, it's too much. Sahaja Yogi: There's one gentleman, mister [inaudible], you see? Shri Mataji: From where? Sahaja Yogi: Algeria. He's a very important lawyer in Algeria. You've met him before. Shri Mataji: His grandma is from Switzerland. Marie: Yes, he went to live. Shri Mataji: He sings very well. Marie: Yes, very good. Shri Mataji: Are you getting Algerians there? Marie: In France, not so many but some people were sent by mister Channal [unsure]. A young couple and the lady had leucemia. I think I wrote to you. Shri Mataji: Oh God! They'll now get all the patients as you know. Hello, John? Can you put on some music? Marie: She's all right now, she's all right. 

Shri Mataji: You treated her? 
Marie: Yes. 
[Shri Mataji is laughing.] 
Marie: But she's treated her herself, Mother. I gave her the picture and she said that I keep praying and praying and praying now, I asked her to. 
Shri Mataji: That's much better. 
Marie: And they are so simple and so good. 
Shri Mataji: Because they become, you see, sort of established in Sahaja Yoga. 
Marie: Yes, yes

Marie: Yes, yes. 
Shri Mataji: He's a doctor, he's a lawyer? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes and he is in England this week. 
Shri Mataji: He is coming here. This week he's coming.
Sahaja Yogi: He is here already in a hotel, nearby. And he phoned me yesterday to ask me whether he could-
Shri Mataji: I will be more free tomorrow or day after tomorrow than today. They have to go and get these styles of yours and all my time is wasted in all nonsensical things.
Nirmala Yoga has come today, it's a good one. 

Sahaja Yogi: There's a little bit something about here. 
Shri Mataji: Yes, put your hand there. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Hamsa more.
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogi: Hamsa. 
Shri Mataji: Hamsa. He does not meditate. You see, if you meditate every day, I can make out on the vibrations. It is easy, it goes on a communicating like dirt you know. And you have to remove every day, it's better. If you go on, then it starts sliding down into privacies. You must meditate, otherwise, it's a big problem. Then suddenly, you find a big mob. 
He's very good, meticulous but he has to gain on speed. And I think with meditation he can do it. Can you become a master? 

[To John] 
You've done it? 
John: Now, here. 
Shri Mataji: Good! He's so speedy, I tell you. Now, what about putting some screws on, one or two. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I nailed it [inaudible] some wood pulp in the holes. 
Shri Mataji: Good, great. He's very fast. 

Shri Mataji: He thinks too much. What are you worried about? 
New Sahaja Yogi: Nothing.
Shri Mataji: And why do you think so much? When the thoughts come, we should say: "Not this, not this, not this." It will work out. I think also, hair should be cut a little bit. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I am only waiting till I go back to France because I have a good hairdresser there. That's why. [Laughter]
Shri Mataji: He doesn't like the hairdressers here, imagine! 
Marie: He's by us, you know, he's really by us [unsure]. 
Shri Mataji: By us towards what? Towards French? 
Marie: Yes
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

That's nice that the French should come here and Indians- The English should go to France and work there. 16:12

[That part is at 58:35 in the first audio] Sahaja Yogini: Are you sending us an English Sahaja Yogis to Paris? Shri Mataji: I wish I could if there was some job for them. Sahaja Yogini: What is it about Gregoire, Mother? Shri Mataji: Gregoire? No, Gregoire is going away to- what's the place. Gregoire is going away to Bonn, Bonn, for about three years he'll be in Bonn and he hates it because of his in-laws there. Marie: But he's not, normally he's not there officially, is he? Shri Mataji: Not yet, but he said soon. But, he would like to go somewhere else. He said: "If I go to Vienna, I don't mind, anywhere but not in Bonn." That's one place he hates. Shri Mataji: What did she say? Marie: She wonders why he was not in Rome any longer. Shri Mataji: Rome? Marie: yes. Shri Mataji: When was he not there? Marie: Because she didn't know that he was finishing at the end of March. Shri Mataji: Who? Marie: Gregoire. Shri Mataji: Yes. 

We have opened an account now, both of us together for the building. We have started now for the building in India. You see, there are three buildings we have to build and all of us must contribute, anything that is possible, you see. So, I said, a minimum of hundred pounds one should contribute in a year.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother? Shri Mataji: Yes. Sahaja Yogini: I have a point here Mother and I can't get rid of it. Shri Mataji: Just sit. What do you have? Sahaja Yogini: It always gets blocked here. 

[Music starts. Shri Mataji might be working on that SY]

Shri Mataji: She has not yet come, I don' t know.

You'd better leave, she won't come, eleven-thirty is worse. She might come; give a bandhan.

Better. What's the matter here? Marie: I don't know, I can feel it rises and then it starts descending [inaudible]. Shri Mataji: That means it is a left Vishudhi, "ne"? It is a left Vishudhi, you should cure it. Marie: It's a very exact spot, Mother, it's a very precise spot. 

Shri Mataji: Are! [Conversation in Hindi.] 
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much. 
This is Rajesh's wife. 
Shri Mataji: This you put this thing in such a container that doesn't require much water. 
It's left Vishudhi. 

You see, this is too much these people are trying to be too much, there is not even one person Madrasis, you see, and nobody appreciated. And all the Satajis were laughing. [In Hindi] Indian Sahaja Yogini: Especially vocal music. Shri Mataji: [In Hindi]. But best would have been to have instrumental. Indian Sahaja Yogini: Flute. Shri Mataji: [In Hindi]. South Indian dancing, that would have been much better than this music of Shubah Lakshmi. And she's not such a singer I tell you. She's not a great musician. What it is, she's good for bhajans and all that. She started first time, singing Hindi bhajans. So, people started to appreciate her. But nothing great compared to what we have, talents. Sahaja Yogi: Excuse-me, Mother, Gregoire, he wants to know if he can take your darshan. Shri Mataji: Who? Sahaja Yogi: Gregoire, he wants to know if he can take your darshan tomorrow at eleven o'clock. Shri Mataji: All right. Better? Sahaja Yogini: Sometimes it's very painful. 

[27:10: end of the first audio part. Cut in the audio 28:57] Sahaja Yogi: Nice souvenir to come back here. Shri Mataji: See with her, all right? Now, this is the bathroom. See my bathroom.
