Conversation, songs, with Shri Mataji, Cambridge, England, 01/01/1982

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Beautiful.

So, you hurried up too much. Will you have something to eat or not?

Sahaja Yogi: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You had your breakfast?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Sure?

So, I wanted to talk to you about France, the programs.

Oh God! What a beauty!

It's a tree! It's a tree, is it?

Sahaja Yogi: A very small tree.

Sahaja Yogi: The tape recorder, Mother.

Shri Mataji: For what?

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: William was very anxious just to hear you Mother; William who came back to France is anxious to know what-

Shri Mataji: You must get some tapes from Gavin, copy of tapes from Rustom are wonderful tapes there. Five tapes.

Sahaja Yogi: Rustom? I have.

Shri Mataji: Rustom. You've got? There are wonderful.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All about Christ and his place and all that, it's very good. They have sent Me these tapes about Christ and really, I was verifying [unsure] , I must say, as I couldn't bear these people having the thing called United Church.

They are uniting all kinds of bhoots and mesmeric people, all sorts! They had all kinds of false gurus, fake gurus, this, that in the name of church. I mean, this is even worse than having a church, isn't it? If there is only one bhoot, you can make it run away.

But this kind of a donkey stuff they are doing, I just can't really explain how they behave like that.

Yes, come in, come in, come in.

Hello.

So Marie, what are they doing these people? What work are they doing now? We are trying to expose.

Marie: They are trying to-

Shri Mataji: But, is it a church organization?

Marie: Not at all, it's completely outside of churches.

Shri Mataji: Independent.

Marie: Very independent.

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Marie: Some of the people are Catholics, some of the people are just-

Shri Mataji: But then who will attack Catholicism?

Marie: They won't, they won't.

Shri Mataji: That's it, you see? That's the point is, that's the basis of the whole thing.

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: That's the basis, you see. Because you see, if you allow one bad thing to continue, the others say: "What have we been doing? We are doing the same thing. Why should you have any objection?" You see? Like in India, there's one "adi guru"- he calls himself- Shankaracharya Arwe fellow. He wants to crown himself and he wants to have a crown and he wants to have a huge, big umbrella weighing tons, you know, with all the gold- what you call, jewellery and everything. Just think of it. Now, if somebody asks him: "Why do you want it?" He says: "What about Pope? Why don't you think of him? Pope does these things, he has got all the jewellery, this thing, that thing. And moreover, on top of that, what he says is the worse thing, that [inaudible] let the Christians here.

They said that at least our Rama, or Krishna wore the real gold stuff. But Christ did, wore only rags. Despite that these people are wearing the jewellery, so, I mean why can't I wear?" He says.

But he doesn't understand he is not Rama.

What to talk? What to say? You see, they are so stupid, you know, you just can't talk to them. And they are convinced with it. I don't know.

So, but you can get some writings from Australia. Australia, I'll let the Australians tell you what they have printed. So, their printing will help you to print in your, this thing. So you write to Warren and he'll send you all the things they have.

Marie: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Also my- somebody has got all the cuttings about Me where I have said this false guru, you should be careful, this thing.

Now, I must tell you a very good thing happened. The TM people here, in Cambridge, suddenly became aware of Jim's restaurant. The head of the department, who was a Dean once upon a time and a very powerful man, he came down to Jim's place. And he saw my photograph. So, he asked for a very special meeting of the TM and he sent invitations. So, Jim wrote to Me and I gave a bandhan and all that, and nobody turned out for the meeting. Not even a single soul. Can you imagine? Not even a single soul. So it's working out, no doubt, at that level, at a very subtle level. It's working out, no doubt.

Yesterday, it was very cold there.

How do you like the house? Yet, it's all removed and, John? He's not putting back in proper places.

Sahaja Yogi: It's vibrated.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: It's vibrated with John, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Isn't it? It's very blissful. Colleen is very nice. You should see the whole house.

Marie: It's quite amazing.

Shri Mataji: Hum? It's very subtle. You know this, I got this from where? Actually, I saw this-

Sahaja Yogi: Which John did you want, Mother?

Shri Mataji: The other one. He took it out and he's not placed it back, you see.

Marie: I think he has just gone out. He went out to see someone.

Shri Mataji: Somebody, to repair the front door.

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It's all right, let him come back. So, you see, what happened, that I went to see one place created by one Georgian artist called Adam, architect, very famous. And he had these, he had all these designs. So, I came back and I design it myself this, on the same lines. They have come quite near that. And then we copy, then the fellow was here he copied it and he made it.
