Conversation, songs, with Shri Mataji, Cambridge, England, 24/03/1982

FIRST AUDIO

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Beautiful.

So, you hurried up too much. Will you have something to eat or not?

Sahaja Yogi: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You had your breakfast?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Sure?

So, I wanted to talk to you about France, the programs.

Oh God! What a beauty!

It's a tree! It's a tree, is it?

Sahaja Yogi: A very small tree.

Sahaja Yogi: The tape recorder, Mother.

Shri Mataji: For what?

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: William was very anxious just to hear you Mother; William who came back to France is anxious to know what-

Shri Mataji: You must get some tapes from Gavin, copy of tapes from Rustom are wonderful tapes there. Five tapes.

Sahaja Yogi: Rustom? I have.

Shri Mataji: Rustom. You've got? There are wonderful.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All about Christ and his place and all that, it's very good. They have sent Me these tapes about Christ and really, I was verifying [unsure] , I must say, as I couldn't bear these people having the thing called United Church.

They are uniting all kinds of bhoots and mesmeric people, all sorts! They had all kinds of false gurus, fake gurus, this, that in the name of church. I mean, this is even worse than having a church, isn't it? If there is only one bhoot, you can make it run away.

But this kind of a donkey stuff they are doing, I just can't really explain how they behave like that.

Yes, come in, come in, come in.

Hello.

So Marie, what are they doing these people? What work are they doing now? We are trying to expose.

Marie: They are trying to-

Shri Mataji: But, is it a church organization?

Marie: Not at all, it's completely outside of churches.

Shri Mataji: Independent.

Marie: Very independent.

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Marie: Some of the people are Catholics, some of the people are just-

Shri Mataji: But then who will attack Catholicism?

Marie: They won't, they won't.

Shri Mataji: That's it, you see? That's the point is, that's the basis of the whole thing.

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: That's the basis, you see. Because you see, if you allow one bad thing to continue, the others say: "What have we been doing? We are doing the same thing. Why should you have any objection?" You see? Like in India, there's one "adi guru"- he calls himself- Shankaracharya Arwe fellow. He wants to crown himself and he wants to have a crown and he wants to have a huge, big umbrella weighing tons, you know, with all the gold- what you call, jewellery and everything. Just think of it. Now, if somebody asks him: "Why do you want it?" He says: "What about Pope? Why don't you think of him? Pope does these things, he has got all the jewellery, this thing, that thing. And moreover, on top of that, what he says is the worse thing, that [inaudible] let the Christians here.

They said that at least our Rama, or Krishna wore the real gold stuff. But Christ did, wore only rags. Despite that these people are wearing the jewellery, so, I mean why can't I wear?" He says.

But he doesn't understand he is not Rama.

What to talk? What to say? You see, they are so stupid, you know, you just can't talk to them. And they are convinced with it. I don't know.

So, but you can get some writings from Australia. Australia, I'll let the Australians tell you what they have printed. So, their printing will help you to print in your, this thing. So you write to Warren and he'll send you all the things they have.

Marie: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Also my- somebody has got all the cuttings about Me where I have said this false guru, you should be careful, this thing.

Now, I must tell you a very good thing happened. The TM people here, in Cambridge, suddenly became aware of Jim's restaurant. The head of the department, who was a Dean once upon a time and a very powerful man, he came down to Jim's place. And he saw my photograph. So, he asked for a very special meeting of the TM and he sent invitations. So, Jim wrote to Me and I gave a bandhan and all that, and nobody turned out for the meeting. Not even a single soul. Can you imagine? Not even a single soul. So it's working out, no doubt, at that level, at a very subtle level. It's working out, no doubt.

Yesterday, it was very cold there.

How do you like the house? Yet, it's all removed and, John? He's not putting back in proper places.

Sahaja Yogi: It's vibrated.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: It's vibrated with John, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Isn't it? It's very blissful. Colleen is very nice. You should see the whole house.

Marie: It's quite amazing.

Shri Mataji: Hum? It's very subtle. You know this, I got this from where? Actually, I saw this-

Sahaja Yogi: Which John did you want, Mother?

Shri Mataji: The other one. He took it out and he's not placed it back, you see.

Marie: I think he has just gone out. He went out to see someone.

Shri Mataji: Somebody, to repair the front door.

Marie: Yes.

Shri Mataji: It's all right, let him come back. So, you see, what happened, that I went to see one place created by one Georgian artist called Adam, architect, very famous. And he had these, he had all these designs. So, I came back and I design it myself this, on the same lines. They have come quite near that. And then we copy, then the fellow was here he copied it and he made it.

But, if you want to see that place, I think it's overdone. Ours is not so much, a little bit. So, I think the French should like it because they don't like too much.

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: So, what is happening to France?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, we have prepared everything, when we come back Mother, to start programs next to the place of Nathalie because it's a very, very light and very nice place. And also we have prepared some programs in Paris. And we-

Shri Mataji: What is the program?

Sahaja Yogi: When?

Shri Mataji: What is the program.

Sahaja Yogi: We have tried to make one program each fifteen days, so we have time to make proper advertisement. Because last time we found out that [when] we have programs each week, there were very few people and they were not very well organized. So we try to put our attention more and advertise.

Shri Mataji: What you do, I tell you. In the Western countries, though they are so affluent, they are very fond of food and entertainment. Indians are not, you see, though we are poor, we are satisfied. I think those who are satisfied are born in India, perhaps.

What you have to do - I got a hint from Christine, you see. We have to learn from each other! [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

What you do, you call them for a weekend and that we'll have music and will have dinner and also we'll have some dogs, the whole day they can spend there. At a weekend. If you ask them to travel somewhere, they like it, first of all. And secondly, you must call them for dinner. They'll be very happy and anxious to do it. But if you just call them for the programs, they are not interested. You see, they are still so gross and so materially sort of- you see, I'm surprised that in affluent countries, people should be so fond of food, it surprises Me. But they are. The more they become affluent, it's like drunkards, you know: once they start drinking, they just want to have more drinks, it's something like that. I mean, the Western people are much more materialistic than Indians are though we are poor people or maybe that temperamentally we are like that. We are satisfied people, aren't we?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You have seen them [In India].

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, very much.

Shri Mataji: You must not have seen any Indian eating anywhere.

Sahaja Yogi: They are very satisfied. They are very loving people.

Shri Mataji: They would get up in the morning, arrange everything for these people for food, everything and you would not see them eating anywhere, sitting down and eating. Serving, looking after you, giving you food, arranging things, running about, but you will never see them sitting down suddenly. But if the - Western people will suddenly rush and sit down on their things and start eating [onomatopoeia].

It is a great [inaudible] I just don't understand. First, I never knew that you are not satisfied people. As far as food is concerned, after a certain age, a person should be satisfied. Say, when you are young, say about five, six years, seven years, one feels like that. But then they grow, you see, and then you don't all the time ask for food, food, food, food, food, so important! It's not so. So this point, you must remember. And Christine has sent Me a hint that if you can call people- Hi John!

Sahaja Yogi: Hello Mother.

Shri Mataji: If you could call people for food and for some entertainment then they'll be there. But if you just say you are coming for programs, they are not interested. They are not interested in programs. And thirdly, my lectures maybe the third position, maybe. The first, food, second entertainment, third, my lectures. So you put my lectures.

Sahaja Yogi: In the last part, when the belly is satisfied. [Laughter.]

Shri Mataji: They are like children still, they are not grown-ups. I tell you now, I've discovered when Christine gave Me a hint that, you see, I was, I never knew this that they are so fond of food. That Western people are so fond of food when they have affluence they are such children still wanting to eat more and more. And if they have food, you see this. We never think of food!

Sahaja Yogi: The house will be open one afternoon, a day per week and a weekend also to any person who is interested and we will share our life and our meals. So...

Shri Mataji: No, no, you have a group meal business. All of them, all the Sahaja Yogis, at least, must be with you that they are going to celebrate Mother's birthday or something, delayed action doesn't matter, but we'll have food, you see.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, OK.

Shri Mataji: Cheese you can have for the French.

[Laughter.]

They have two hundred types of cheese but still, they go for one cheese! All right, so you have something to eat and something entertainment then you can give them the lectures. I tell you they are still children compared to Indians.

We are not interested in food, we are not! By the time we have our- even children in India are not interested, you have to run after them with the plate in your hand: "Eat, eat, eat." They won't eat. Just they don't eat. You ask any father, mother in India, they'll have one problem: "Still they don't eat what to do?" Just don't eat.

Here I have seen that I used to think it's only one or two, but if it's a common thing that people will just come and eat this thing, that, they come from there, eat, properly done. No question, in India.

Now, the servant, look at him.

Sahaja Yogi: He does not eat very much.

Shri Mataji: He, you see, you give him anything, it's lying there. He will not eat, I will not eat, C.P. will not eat. We just don't eat anything.

But, I've seen that with Western people you just lay it down, it's finished. You see, you have to finish [inaudible] it's just finished.

It's a thing, you see, it's a, I think it's the mind perhaps, maybe.

Sahaja Yogi: They are not satisfied inside,so.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: So we know that when we eat we are-

Shri Mataji: I think it's just nervousness.

Maire: It's desiring something and not knowing what you want. So you take the most obvious thing which is food. Or you know what you desire but you don't want to go for it because it requires more discipline. And instead of -

Shri Mataji: No, but we don't put any pressure on ourselves. Automatically, Marie, I tell you, it is automatic. We don't put any pressure. I mean if we get food well and good, if we don't get doesn't matter.

But sort of it's not such an important thing for us to have food.

It's more respect, more manners. Manners are very important in India. Say, if you are unmannerly then a person will think as if he has been stumped, you see. If somebody says you are unmannerly, it's the worse thing that you can say to an Indian. So if you eat like this and it's regarded also as unmannerly in India. I think you've developed this. I've seen my grandchildren now just don't eat, just don't eat at all. You give them anything, you give them chocolates, you give them this, they'll throw it. 
Very little. Maybe, they like some icecreams sometimes. So, I get some icecreams for them. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] That's all I think, nothing much. 

But I think this eating also comes as nervousness. They don't know what they are seeking and they start eating food. Then entertainment. So do it: first of all food, then entertainment, then my lectures. And then Realization. Also, they are some people who will just listen to the lectures, they'll say: "I just want to listen, that's all." The desire is up to that point, then finished. 

This is India, is it? You are all so much tanned. Sahaja Yogini: Our liver Mother. Shri Mataji: Now, you are tanned with liver, is it? [Laughter] [Inaudible] Sahaja Yogini: It's true. Shri Mataji: In India, it was very bad. Sahaja Yogini: But I also get tanned very fast, Mother - I try never to go in the sun because I don't like it. But even I get tanned very fast. Shri Mataji: That's liver. Liverish personality. Oh God! This liver business is too much. So, stop eating cheese, absolutely. For liver, I don't know what to do but left to the right is a good idea for liver, very good idea. And don't think too much. You still think too much. I think Lord's prayer will help you. If you say Lord's prayer, Agnya will be balanced. If Agnya is balanced- there's not a single photograph which I can say is like Christ, to save. 

Sahaja Yogi: We bought from India a picture where we see only the nose and your Agnya. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogi: There is a big picture, in India, of You. We see only your eyes and your Agnya. You know, like that, just like that. And we put it in the meditation room. 
Shri Mataji: Only my eyes. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, and your forehead.
Shri Mataji: Is it? I have not seen that. 

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I have pictures Mother from India. From Alex? Shri Mataji: [In Hindi] Marie: Your glasses? Shri Mataji: Glasses. Who are these? Sahaja Yogi: Destandey's daughters Mother and Patricia. Shri Mataji: Hum? Whose's daughters? Sahaja Yogi: Bestanday's daughters. Shri Mataji: Who was? Sahaja Yogi: Mister Deshpande Shri Mataji: Deshpande. Deshpande was a big [?] Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I know. Shri Mataji: This is tremendous, you see? These photographs are even improving gradually I see I'm showing myself. I just bring my spectacles. [Shri Mataji leaves the room.]

[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: I was very tired in Delhi birthday. We used to have so many programs and it was nice.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I was wondering, would you like to be taken in video during your trip?

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: Would you like to be taken in video film during your trip of Europe?

Shri Mataji: Video film, when?

Sahaja Yogi: When you are going in Europe, this year.

Shri Mataji: Video film, all right, let's see. I have no objection to anything.

[Inaudible.]

Shri Mataji: Oh, you saw this?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it's Walt Disney, Indians [inaudible] It's spiritual Disney Land Mother.

Shri Mataji: Where was this? Where was this picture?

Sahaja Yogi: In a big kind of museum we can say -

Shri Mataji: In Dehli?

Sahaja Yogi: Not in Dehli, no. Where there are all the saints.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see, I see. Yes, they said: "You must see that and " I never go there. Yes.

Very tired ...

This is a very good photograph, you see, it's got the whole image of [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi: These are baptised by the water and the sitar is like this playing, [laughter] it was very nice, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You enjoyed yourself, hey?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

It was much more deep this year.

Shri Mataji: Hum?

Sahaja Yogi: I had a deeper experience this year in India.

Shri Mataji: Ah, very good.

Sahaja Yogi: I felt more, I felt more vibrations.

Shri Mataji: Where is it, the difference?

Sahaja Yogi: It is when we went to this temple, we went to a big temple Mother.

Shri Mataji: Ah, ah. They gave you the cool [inaudible] Kolhapur.

Sahaja Yogi: Kolhapur [unsure].

Shri Mataji: It is the same Disney Land.

Sahaja Yogi: Disney Land. Yes spiritual.

Shri Mataji: Very few Indians- foreigners must have gone there, to this Disney Land, you know.

Sahaja Yogi: It's very funny to fish, you go out and-.

Shri Mataji: Yes, there're very few have gone there.

All of these photographs of [?] have got something, a special expression. Disney Land, I've not been there.

Sahaja Yogi: This one is wonderful.

Shri Mataji: How did you get these colours? I never got a shawl like this, of this colour.

Sahaja Yogi: It was in Dehli, Mother.

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: Father, mother. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] C.P. was laughing really, he should see these also. He would say: "What are these? [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: It was a wonderful marriage. [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: Everybody watching them, you know, in the streets.

Where was that? Haldi.

So much of mirth and happiness and joy for everyone.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have learned a song from India. Shall we sing it to you?

Shri Mataji: All right, sing it. Indian song? It's an Indian or an English song?

Sahaja Yogi: It's an Indian Mother.

Shri Mataji: Now, what're the words?

Sahaja Yogis [Marathi, 2]:

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

Mataji nchya sange badha bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange badha bi ghadali

Badha bi ghadali Prakashamaya zhali

Badha bi ghadali Prakashamaya zhali

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Matajinchya sange Dharma bi ghadala

Matajinchya sange Dharma bi ghadala

Dharma bi ghadala Vishwa Dharma zhala

Dharma bi ghadala Vishwa Dharma zhala

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mataji nchya sange mule bi ghadali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

Mule bi ghadali Chaitanyata nhali

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Shri Mataji: You've got it very well. You can see-

It's a very sweet song, isn't it? It's a written by -

Look at that one, what is he doing?

Sahaja Yogi: He's cutting the trees there.

Shri Mataji: He is cutting the trees?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. A little branch and after it will go there again.

Shri Mataji: On my God.

So, this song, you know the meaning?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It's a double meaning. "Bi ghadalo" means "spoiled", we got spoiled, you know, the dharma got spoiled and we became the dharma of the universe, you see. The religion got spoiled and we became the religion of the universe, like that. It's very a double meaning, it's beautiful and written by Tukaram. Now, you have seen his picture, yes.

Sahaja Yogi: Tukaram!

Shri Mataji: Yes!

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I'm very pleased to learn a song from him, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It is a- at the end, his name come in, but they have not put it in this one. Because [inaudible] for Mataji. But it is Tukaram who has sung this. So, you have seen his film, you remember his film in Pune?

Sahaja Yogi: So nice, Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's a very beautiful film. You remember Nathalie, that film of Tukaram?

Nathalie: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: The same one has written this song "amhi bighadalo tumhi bi ghadana" that "I am spoiled so you also get spoiled". And it has a double meaning "bi ghadalo". Also means the sea has taken its form "bi ghadana", the sea has taken its form and you also do it. Just like that.

Very straightforward, simple words but very deep, you see. Who taught you this one?

Sahaja Yogi: Before we were leaving, I had some Indian to sing some songs and write the words.

Shri Mataji: My sister sang this song. Did you tape her?

Sahaja Yogi: What happened, this night [inaudible] and something happened and we lost it. This tape has been lost.

Shri Mataji: But some people must have it.

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe Douglas, because he's not ready yet. Maybe, Douglas- Malcolm has recorded everything from you from India.

Shri Mataji: Yes, so he must have got it, yes.

Sahaja Yogi: This tape, we have it.

Shri Mataji: All right, so. And this-

Marie: Mother?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Marie: I know you said that the Goddess doesn't understand French but there's some beautiful song to the Virgin Mary, in France.

Shri Mataji: No, you sing that, that I understand.

Marie: That, you understand.

Shri Mataji: They look so nice. You see this?

Sahaja Yogi: Oh, yes Mother, beautiful.

Shri Mataji: You see, before a song starts, it has vibrations, you know. So, I understand that. Those I understand, not the language.

Marie: Can we sing to you Mother?

Shri Mataji: Please.

Marie: It says: Mother, be the queen of our home, be the queen of our country.

Shri Mataji: Now, say it.
