And be coming back to Sydney again. And stay here have been wonderful.

We have made the largest number of people and you have to look after the people who are going to come here now.

We have to be very cautious and careful with the new people because they don't know about Sahaj Yog, they don't know about the kingdom of god, so don't have to show off in any way. Try to be kind and nice to them and tell them everything.

In such a manner, as if you're trying to be very helpful to them.

Don't get angry with them, don't shout at them. So very big responsibility, I think, to. Get the new people. In proper shape. It's a knack I think. It has to be a nack if you find somebody rather difficult or someone, then you ask somebody else to deal with that, go on on shifting such a person, so that person gets fed up and will go away if somebody is asking too many questions or anything. Also, you try this thing like that, you see, don't go on arguing, don't argue with anyone. Too much arguments will not bring anything, you know in Sahaja Yoga cannot be argued on some extent is all right, but too much. It should not be argued. Now. We have achieved quite a lot in Sydney and for the whole world to see that if you can do that in Sydney, why not anywhere else? Let us see what happens, but, tomorrow's, Melbourne program and the program of television may work out something better. Gradually, you can show them the miraculous photographs that's also is quite convincingif you you talk to them about miraculous this thing and gradually can then start talking about me and what John has said about me.

But slowly, slowly, they should be introduced to Sahaja Yoga. Now, I would say for puja, very few people new should be invited to begin with slowly. Then you can invite some of them and some of them you can take them to India also, but first you must test them, see how they are, how are there reactionsand carefully doit. Now there has been a little problem always that leaders in other centres or other places or in the same say Sydney, or maybe Melbourne and Adelaide, or anywhere, people just start thinking that they'll become great. That sort of situation should not arrive.

Leaders have to be very humble.

And have to be very much under the main leader that you have here.

Nobody who has right to oust the leader, who is here.

Or say things like that, this is. I've heard today that.

They asked James to get out of Sahaja Yoga out of the ashram.

Such a thing should never be done again. I've never known such a thing and happen here, but should never be done again. I know when to remove who and I know how to adapt things. You better not interfere with that. Also whatever the leader tells you, listen to him, you are very lucky you have such a good leader like James, because I've seen people are very hot-tempered, very one-sided. They try to dominate people, they try to have their own way. He is a very sensible man, very balanced person and I'm very lucky I found him, so please don't try to disturb him wherever you are, he tells you anything. Listen to him, whatever is the problem talk to him.

If something goes wrong in him I am the one who would correct. Please don't try to correct him. You must respect your leader very much in the presence of others.

You must respect them. Actually. We have started a system in London where we said that to the leader we should to the elders, we should call them by mr, not by names.

That also was never there before. We never used to call elder people with their names, but it failed. I think it's rather difficult for people to take to new habits. Gradually it might work on it's. Better to say, mr, especially in the presence of others. They understand that they are older people, so they are calling them mr. And to your equal age you can call them by names. They are very much impressed to see that you respect the age that's very important part these days to see. Especially. We have so many elderly people coming and if you talk to them now, say they what's your name, you you should say what's your name, please? And if they say but say my name is Jack mr Jack, you should say not a you, Jack, come here.

Very common, you see a little boy, say, of 20 years calling an old man of 70 years, you Jack, come here.

Looks very funny, it's not good. Does not be how of Sahaja Yogi. So Sahaja Yogi must have a sense of respect that's very important. After reading Markandeya and understanding him, how respectful he was.

This respect descents is not only in me, it descends to everyone like the grace descents, the joy descents in the same respect also. Respecting others is very important in Sahaja Yoga. Secondly, never argue among yours ourselves that's very important part.

In the presence of others, never argue always support each other. Don't support a non Sahaja Yogi.

Never support a non Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogis have to support Sahaja Yogis in the presence of others you should not argue at all.

Thirdly, now we have also certain cases in which we have to reorganize marriages. Sometimes we have to send some people away, some people this way, that way it always helps is for your good is like a circulation system. I see something is not all right, alright, so what you do? You take it out, to treat it well and put it back.

In the same way. If somebody is not all right fitting it properly there, then you can take that person out, treat that person again if he fits well. So you should thank your stars that it can happen and it can work out. The whole attitude should be how much we gain, how much we can, improve how much we can go ahead. That should be our attitude, and then one has to realize that this is such a great work.

In the whole history of spirituality and the whole history of humanity that has never been such a revolution, so we are all part and parcel of that revolution, so we have to understand.

We have to understand that we have to be strong standing on our legs, on our feet. Now there are people who depend on their wives for, say, they like, for vibrations or wives depend on the husband. Tell me every time tell me what are the vibrations? No, you stand on your own legs and find out what are the vibrations like. You're not to depend on them. Wives should not try to dominate the husbands and husband also should not try to sort of belittle wives. That's how things will work out very well, because in the presence of others, whatever is our behavior, how we look before them, that is going to impress them the best.

We may have to have more ashrams more places, I think, because so many people are increasing in sizes, I would say you can start a fund here, some sort of a fund for yourself with which I have nothing to do in the fund called as a building fund. You can call it something, or we can see if you can find some land somewhere gradually if you can buy some land and build a proper ashram, bigger in size, where people could stay something like that if you can manage, need not be in the city because maybe expensive or you could find an old house which is still appadated than be renovated by us, like we give you Shudy camp, so you can have a bigger place with a bigger hall and things can be worked out in that way because I don't think this all is sufficient, even for you.

So now the whole thing has been so beautiful and so good and so excellent. The success was so great.

And we are going to have success after success, no doubt, but only it depends on how many of you rise higher and higher. The more you rise, the rest will come behind. Don't fall down with any ideas with any, depressive thinking, or we can say of aggressive thinking just be there and be in thoughtless awareness, grow in meditation, achieve your depths, everything will be solved and everything will be perfect.

I want to thank you, especially for arranging this program in Sydney in such a wonderful way, and the Steven, who has arranged for the TV program also, and the way it was so successful in that beautiful hall and it's unforgettable the way people got their realization. So all of you are responsible for working so hard for distribuing those pamphlets and putting up posters and things like that, apart from that is, your dedication is your love, your understanding about Sahaja yoga that has helped so much thank you ever so much may God bless you.

Yogi: Thank you for coming Mother.
