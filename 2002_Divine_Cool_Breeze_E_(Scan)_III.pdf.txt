 Diwali Puja Los Angles - 18.11.2001 (Pravachana of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi) It's a very-very great day today, I should say, where the evil the knowledge is very subtle, very subtle; it's not superficial knowledge, it is very subtle, and because they don't has been suppressed. Where evil that spreads its power all over is only know this subtle knowledge they fall because of two factors; one is that you into the wrong path of, I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose not knowledgeable, you are are staying blind and you follow things the people who are doing good. But above all, is the power of God. All this which are not right but you think are drama is played to prove the existence powerful. This illusion creates not only of that great Power. It has all worked problems but absolute destruction. So we faced a very big challenge, no out so well and for all of you, Sahaja yogis, it's a very great achievement doubt, and it was easily solved. It was that you can see the play. Many people based on all wrong basis just to create who have achieved so called success a problem. Problem was created with a purpose and nobody could imagine cannot see that, but you can see it that it would be solved so easily and so because you are spectators. Though quickly. My desire was to get over it all the world is a part-and-parcel of the drama, you are outside it, and so you before the Diwali, that has happened. Due to ignorance also people do lots of can see it so clearly. Whatever has things. Anybody who follows some happened nobody could have believed it that it would finish before Diwali. religion or some sort of a thing, it's only because they are not aware of the truth, they are ignorant about achieving the truth, and they cling on to which is being created and we also So it goes like this, the stupidity the fact that they know everything. sometimes think that this kind of stupid With all this happening there have thing will impress others. Impression is been so many factions, so many stupid not the point. If you see among all people, who are getting completely these people who are lost, what ruined by ignorance. Now before impression have they created? They were there to create a great impression coming to Sahaja yoga, you know, all

 May-June 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 5 & 6 on you to show as if they were great think, we understand many things warriors and fighters but what which animals cannot understand. We cook our food, they don't. But also impression they have created! sometimes I think we cook our brains Whether you are a realised soul or not because the way people behave and they can see that it's a miracle, it's a try to avoid the truth with their ego is miracle, how things have worked out, Now the new phase has started. You surprising. all have a very-very open challenge to All this happens. It is a drama, as I get people into enlightenment. People told you, but you better study it properly and apply it to yourself and see if you are not so ignorant now, they are not so much blasted. Moreover, I find them are also a part-and-parcel of that very much changed. Their attitude drama. For that you have to rise higher, towards truth has changed, and they you have to rise higher, higher above understand there is truth beyond all this that they have gone through. It's your ego and your super ego, your very important because if a human conditioning and from there to watch yourself, to see yourself. What is this? being starts thinking this is the truth they just get stuck up. At any cost Why am I doing such and such thing? Why my attention is like that? What is whatever may happen, he will go on the main reason for my own sticking to that. He won't be able even possession, I should say, or for my own to verify whether it is the truth or not. misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things? Once you start seeing Animals can make out because they that, and if you find even a wee bit of have got innate capacity to smell the such nonsensical understanding within evil, innate. We cannot, human beings you then you can forgive also people cannot. If there's a evil man, a dog will bark at him, otherwise it will go and who have been absolutely brain- throw him down. It will do everything washed, absolutely brainwashed and they did everything under that which is not normally done. How is it he influence. As it is now you have risen has developed this capacity to find out much higher than all these people and who is a thief and who is not? We have much more aware than all of them. So a higher awareness. We think about you have to just understand this point many things which animals cannot

And for everything as to what things are the people who are actually bad you happening and how they are don't have to worry, that's the work of happening, how they are working. the Divine power to destroy them. That's not your work. You are a Watch yourself and see for yourself if soldier, so you have to just fight, you have any of such ideas, any fight the ignorance, your own and lingering either. Try to cleanse the of others because mostly soldiers fail when they have their ego.

There should be no should cleanse yourself. obstacle but you should just push forward and know that there is no There are people who have done obstacle at all. It's just a myth that lots of wrong things. I simply pity them. there are some obstacles and that They have done wrong things, it is you can overcome. It's not easy to their responsibility to see what they raise the awareness of people because it looks there's a very little have been doing. Why they have been distance of crossing over but it's doing it? What is the need to do that? not so, it's not so. It is a very All this introspection will work out so well, then your real powers will come, difficult task sometimes for some people to get out of the bandhans of your powers of giving realisation, your powers to understand the problems of Agya. At that point, I find, some of you fail and for that the best thing is your country. of the whole world. And to introspect. When you think you once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out, you have the are always correct and you are alright, the best is to introspect. Am responsibility to fight it out, then things Il doing everything right or not? How will work out. You cannot leave am I working for my betterment? everything to the Divine Power. You The illusion is such that sometimes have to use the Divine power and you have to work it out because you are you think you are doing well. Say, in the soldiers of Divine. Of-course, with our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type; they will come that beautiful idea you start cleansing

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 5 & 6 May-June 2002 find out faults within yourself. What are forward, they will do this, do that, these things that are staggering you? This is the best way of improving your but inside what is the purpose? The purpose is that people should see that you are doing this work, that awareness. Like you are going in the work. The purpose should be that car, and you have to know the road, you have to know how you are driving, you should be able to see yourself within. You must see what is the you have to see what are the problem inside and you will very problems, but instead of that, you think, oh-no end of yourself! It won't well understand that you have been of great help to yourself and to others. For example, there's a very work out. Today is a day of very great big building and all the buildings that happening, I should say. Celebrating are in nearby area may fall down due to earthquake but this one building the Diwali is a very-very joyous, but this joy is not for ourselves. This joy is which will be standing erect. The for the whole world. We have to work reason is that, that building is constructed on very solid ground. In for the whole world. We worked for the same way if Sahaja Yoga is ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, constructed on a very sound ground whatever it is, but what are you doing for others? That you should see in nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it. And every person has to do yourself. It is very important. Only that. For example, some people told such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga me your Sahaja yogis, you know are like this, like that, are big show offs. I care and they are doing something for said, really? I can't believe it that they others. It's a great enjoyment with that. could be like that! I said, I would like to When the lights are burning, to give because they have concern, they have you happiness, they are burning their meet them whosoever they are. So they said, no, you can find them out bodies to give you happiness. They yourself, who are those people, and are the ones who should teach us that why they behave like this. I said, we have to do something ourselves to myself I know everything but I want enjoy our own higher awareness. All this will work out, I am sure. I am also you to know. Finding faults with others trying my best to make this light is a very nice thing, very easy also but

 May - June 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 5 & 6 unshaken and full of enthusiasm, think of the past and the problems of the past. You have now overcome it. There, it is you who are anxious to fill your pitchers; can do it. It's not my Just enjoy yourself and have faith in anxiety that's going to help you. So, yourself and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen, very quickly it will you stop even if you want to have complete picture about yourself. You happen. It is your desire, also you have to first give up identification have method of working it out, you have anxiety to work it out. Main with yourself otherwise you will never know what's wrong with you. anxiety should be: how can If you are too much identified with transform this person?" You can transform anyone. You tell one you, you cannot. person, another person follows it. Like Now, as it is what is the aim after when we came in the plane, I found at all, what is the aim of our lives? We the airport so many people had put up have to change the whole world into a their hands towards me like that. I peaceful thing. Changing yourself of- said, "who are these people?" They course is a great thing no doubt, but were not Sahaja yogis. They had seen changing others also we solve all the somebody or what has. happened I problems of the world. If all the people could not ask them. But all of them of this world become good people, said they are feeling cool breeze in Sahaja yogis then can you imagine their hands. They didn't know anything about it, they didn't know about what will happen! Think of that dream I have, that we have to change each kundalini, nothing. Then what is this and every person, that we can change cool coming? But basically they are there to get their realisation, only we and we have to transform them into good people. If they are not have to extend our ideas, we have to transformed they are like a candle extend our love, instead of getting without any flame, and if they are annoyed with them, better is to give capable of getting transformed we should try all methods, all the tricks to that they are very anxious to get do that.

So, again I will say are waiting there for you to give them introspection is very-very important in self realisation, and let them celebrate their Diwali with you. Enjoy the Diwali. Sahaja Yoga, and the light inside is there, you have to look after it. Diwali you cannot celebrate with I was extremely happy to hear from one candle. You have to have more and more candles; that's what is your many people that they felt the blessings of Diwali. But you see, job. Only by your own candle you are yesterday you had these showers, going to do it, it's your own and it can how timely they were, never happened enlighten anyone. Then why not use it in the history of this world, never at any cost, at any place? I have met some Sahaja yogis, I asked them, happened. Why yesterday these what did yo do? They said, no, showers came and tried to give a new nothing, nothing, we did nothing. experience of the showers? All this is a Why? Then what's the use of getting time, I should say that even the nature realisation if you have done nothing? knows, and we should also know that You don't want to give realisation to this is the time for a special thing. Normally I get letters about people anyone, don't want to talk to anyone, who are sick or their parents are sick you feel so shy about it. Then I met or their this is sick, all types of, then some who said, just now, Mother, we are coming from your programme. somebody's marriage is broken, then somebody has children they are sick. "How are you so late?" Because they Means all kinds of nonsensical told us that there's some bomb scare. problems they write about. Reason is "So you were waiting outside?" "Yes". "How many?" "All of us". Thousands waiting, there was no bomb. They said this, they themselves who write are not realised souls, or may be they are half baked because they could themselves there's no bomb so we went inside and we all got our realisation. "But you say that why should we write to Mother? We can get it done ourselves! were realised souls!" No, we had a Instead of that one has to write what realisation that sometimes we have to wait but now we are convinced that they have achieved, how they have nobody can harm us, nobody can achieved that, how they have got love from others, how they have worked out trouble us, overpower us, only we do it

You have to respect "my mother is sick, my father is sick'. yourself. If you are their relation it's All these relationships, they go on of your business, like none understanding wisdom that we are killing you. So no one is your brother, nobody is your sister, only Sahaja here, we have come here for a very- yogis are your brothers and sisters. very special work, of very high quality. If that is not then all such people write. Now you have some cousins and cousins, so let it be. That's not your One lady got married in Sahaja job. You don't have to work it out. Even Yoga, and she wrote to me that I was before coming I got letters like that somebody's cousin's cousin, this thing divorced about eight months back or is sick. So, I asked this lady, I said, nine months back and all my relations why do you write all these things, all are now saying, why did you marry in the time about this cousin and that Sahaja Yoga, and every body is criticising me and Sahaja Yoga. I said, cousin? She said, Mother I am trying who asked her to marry? I never asked Oh! Sahaja spread to yoga. her. So now the marriage has become Because if they will be cured then they will come to Sahaja Yoga. This the main point for her, that all my is not the way we want to spread family people are saying, What did Sahaja Yoga. It looks like advertising they do for Sahaja Yoga? If this or something speciality that you marriage doesn't become alright then should cure somebody then some they will say that something is wrong people will come to Sahaja Yoga. We with Sahaja Yoga, let them say. We just don't want such people. I never have not committed that way. Everytime I have told you that don't want to hurt but I want to give you write to me for your mother, father corrections and understanding and the wisdom. Why are you Sahaja Yogis? this, that. If you don't know how to Just to cure all the relations? They cure them, better give up Sahaja may be sick because of some Yoga. You yourself can cure them. mistakes they have committed.

 May-June 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 5 & 6 Sahaja Yoga? "No". "Mother?" "No". "Brother?" "No, nobody". So, why are the attention is on wrong things and on wrong basis. If you have some you asking me? What relationship I intelligence, then you must know that have with them? They are not Sahaja now you belong to a very high quality yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja spiritual people which are very few, in this world. They are very few and you yogis. They are not Sahaja yoigs so must make a concentrated effort why do you want to trouble me? It is seeing that this quality must be in so impossible to understand. In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get self many and there must be lots of realisation, alright. Then those who aspirants. Find them out, tell them-you have found it, so you can also have it. want to have self realisation, you can But don't worry about things which are give them and fix them properly but of no value to you. You must know you instead of somebody who is hanging in are a special race, you are special the air and who is falling from the soldiers who have been trained for airport to some other place, all kinds of doing Sahaja work. So, wasting things, all this is really maddening and energy on your relations, on brothers and sisters is no good for you. It is to sickening. I am not concerned, you should not be concerned also. be understood now that you have your own energy, preserve it. For what? For What you should do is to see that these people who are talking about it Sahaja yogis. You should should come to Sahaja Yoga, and you everyone who is a Sahaja yogi or must tell them because you are not wants to become a Sahaja yogi, who doing Sahaja Yoga that's why it is are established Sahaja yogis you must there or that person is not doing help them because we are one Sahaja Yoga that's why this is the personality, and these are all the different hands of one personality, one problem. We are alright, we are fine. Because Sahaja Yoga is open so God. So, this oneness must be established within yourself, and everybody comes there. I would others request you on a Diwali day to promise to yourself, I will not waste my energy should also see that oneness in you. There are some on people who are not Sahaja yogis. people who are very active, there are some persons who are very It's very important because all the time

All that you will work out, I am sure, because this is the see and you will definitely try to correct it if you love that or you give up. These are special people, specially selected year of great achievements and great success but with that if you start doing for a very special cause and you can- something nonsensical, nothing will not waste your energy on small work out. Of-course, I don't say that nonsensical things that is one thing we haven't got such Sahaja yogis with you should know. us, we have. We have all the soldiers On this Diwali day you have to with us, no doubt. All the armaments know that you have to burn yourself they have, everything they have, but for the light of the Divine, to absolutely we need more and for that we have to work out collectively. Must plan what spread all over. But don't do it too should we do. much. Like some people came and told me, Mother, we have given up Recently there has been a big our parents, we have given up this, argument about the Islamic behaviour. we have given up that, still we are not good. So, I said, why should you nor Hindus. We are not, because you give up? You are catching on to cannot put yourself into a small arena something then you are giving up, or saying I am Sahaja yogi but I am a automatically all this is finished. We are neither Christians, nor Islamic Christian, you cannot. You have to No, we were, you see, very much give up that margin.

I have seen many Muslims also people are no good, and don't who came to Sahaja Yoga but out of pay too much attention to them. them very few are real Sahaja Yogis, They don't deserve any attention. but they will come, listen to my lecture, That is very much to be understood this that. But very few are really that you should not also be like that Sahaja yogis, in the real sense of the nor you should have friends like word.

The truth is that Sahaja today in the Christmas become the Spirit. He is the one who Puja. Christianity has has talked about the Second Birth, of spread all over the world realization, but they have forgotten and there are so many, so called, Christians who say achieve.

Completely opposite. this religion. There is no religion, which is following really its principles as have been described. I don't know how they Essence of Christ's life was detachment and sacrifice. For a manage to twist the truth in this manner, just to make some money or person who is detached, there is nothing like sacrifice. He sees his life some fuss. Such a ritualistic stuff is as just a drama. Such a great going on in the name of Christ. Though personality came on this earth and they have faltered so many times and created this so-called Christian they had experience of such bad religion, which has gone into wars. All influence on the world. We don't know kinds of hypocritical things and now why such a round about things come the people are discovering about it. He up and people accept it.

So many specially there is a class called things I have corrected in my own life "Wahabis', these people are saying time. I was surprised, how could I do that the women are the one who spoil it? But these Muslims and Islamics, you cannot correct them. Such horrible your morality and so hide them. They should be covered. Any women who things they do to their women and were wearing white chappals in whenever you try to help them, it is Afghanistan, they were beating them, impossible. For example I started a killed them, and so many people in place for the women who are left-out in the world alone, who are like orphans, India, specially in North, have taken to who have children.

All of them were spiritual, spiritually equipped? What there and nothing has happened to can it work out. What ever we know about human beings we try to draw them.

Before Diwali this very difficult. Its impossible to put this war will be over and it ended. What a into their heads. stupid thing to think that they can So what ever is possible we have to destroy the creation of God like this? do our maximum. Put our attention to Who are they?

Have faith in yourself. think they lack in faith or whatever it is. work it out and talk about it. But Sahaja yogis are little shy. Once I was going A very few people come out and do it. In Italy, I have seen and also Australia, by plane. One lady was very very hot. So I asked her "what Guru she Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot because of their conviction that we have to give followed. She told me the name. I was others what we have. We have to surprised that she didn't know share it. From the life of Christ one has anything about spirituality, and these to understand his sacrifice. It is such a people have huge houses and big lot of sacrifice to be crucified like that, temples and everything, and she was telling me the praise of her Guru. I with the thieves, but he did it! In the same way when you all people want to thought she was very shameless. She do Sahaja Yoga work, you should not has not got anything in her? She was so very hot, and she is talking about it. But Sahaja yogis won't. I was father, what will happen to my grand think, what will happen to my grand mother. I mean whatever letters I get surprised why Sahaja yogis don't talk are all about this. Its very funny. They about it. The other day I had gone with somebody in the market and I had a are only worried about some relations. They are not worried about the relation Sahaja Yogi with him. Now I was surprised that he started telling them all over the world you have, worried about me and he started giving them about the wife or children, I get only realisation and they were very happy letters like this. Nobody writes to me about it. Every where you go, you have that they have given realisation to so many people. They never write how neighbours, you go to markets, every they have been able to achieve where you should go and talk about it. Like they sing carols, we should also spreading of Sahaja Yoga. None have bhajans and things to tell other writes. Very surprising. You have to tell me. I hope you all people people. We have to tell. Why are we so understand the importance of shy? This shyness is not going to help spreading Sahaja Yoga. If you don't do Sahaja Yoga. So please see that you

The should be married, and I have not got greatest thing for me, as you have so many lights here, we should have married as yet. Marriage was never our idea but then we had to allow many more Sahaja yogis all over the marriages, and now it has become the world. If you want to change this world, and if you want to avoid all main issue with everyone. Either they are not married, if they are married, the trials and tribulations of the useless life they are leading, you they are not happy.

Now the kind of don't want you to write all these things to me. It shows how poor you letters I get that they want to marry. are in Sahaja Yoga. Why not write to Alright. There are many girls who me how many people you have given claim that we have been applying for 4 years, we couldn't get married. Firstly realisation to. That will make me happy.

Just think of it. But they Sahaja Yoga. In every religious write letters of complaints that we movement there have been so many have applied 4 times. We cann't, we wrong things. While in Sahaja Yoga I think marriages are a very big hurdle. can't help it. So you go outside, marry Moreover boys don't come, because in anywhere you feel like or else you wait India very easy to marry boys. You and see and dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga. Its a very difficult thing also get money, this, that. But girls,

They will have their own marriages, though they for his coming on this earth is Agya. are Sahaja yogis. I cann't understand And if you give realisation they have the crucifixion of Christ, for his birth why in Sahaja Yoga also, after coming crossed the Agya. They have gone to realisation, to them marriage is a beyond and they are in Sahasrara. So very important thing! What is most in Sahaja Yoga you understand every important is that how many people thing. It is very easy to understand. you give realization to. That is your Sahaja Yoga is the simplest thing to understand, but after self realisation, life. If a lotus is there, it will open, but it So you have to go round and see how must give fragrance. Even the lotus has the responsibility. Then what many people you can give realisation about you people? I am not saying you to. Every thing is alright. All your get crucified like Christ. No, 1 say you worshipping is alright. Your puja is enjoy your life, you have peace and alright. But what is most important is, how many people you have given stability, balance, but at the same time realisation to? I would like to know how you have to spread Sahaja Yoga. This is what is your job now. Your job is many people you have given, not important. Only this is Specially with ladies. Ladies are rather important how many people you weak in giving realisation. They can do give realization to. It is very-very a lot, I know, they can. After all I am difficult becaue they have made a also a woman. But some how I find the mess of all the great incarnations, all ladies in Sahaja Yoga are not of a level. They can do a lot and lot but those great Sufis and Saints. But at some how they don't understand the least you people don't do that. So importance of their lives. You are very please try to think whom can you give realization? To whom you can talk important. How many people there are about Sahaja Yoga? We have to who have got realisation. There were spread out, and next time I hope I hear so many sufis who got realisation. They write poetry, finished. There from you, how many people you have given realisation to. were so many saints who did so much,

They wrote all these things. Pepole will read them but timing. But if you are people in nothing happens. You have the art of majority, who have really become giving realisation. You know about Saints and making others saintly, then Kundalini. You know all about it. Go I am for you. Otherwise I am available ahead and talk to people. I was alone to you. You can have my vibrations, when I started Sahaja Yoga, and I am you can have my pujas. All these things are permitted, no doubt. But for a woman! So what about you? There is that you are only capable, you are only now a challenge for all of you. How many people have you made Sahaja entitled for that, if you are doing yogis? Even in your family, people are Sahaja Yoga, if you are spreading not Sahaja yogis. Your daughter is not. Sahaja Yoga, if you are giving to Your son is not. So what's the use of others, then only you will be singing glory to Chirst? If you are considered really capable of receiving singing glory to him, you must make the vibrations of the Goddess. In some people cross their Agya. He is so countries if it is so much powerful, why highly placed within us. But you have not with your country, with your neighbourhood, with your friends, with never respected him, that such a your relations, it is powerful. So tonight highly placed personality in you have you have to decide that you are going crossed over, so why not others? to dedicate yourself in giving it to Let us see from today's Puja how others. It is very joy giving, talking much determination you have. You about Sahaja Yoga. May God bless you. should know that a Goddess does not

All the ordeals through which into the kingdom of God. And even to stay there, and to enjoy the blessings of Shri Ganesha, we have to have our we had passed, we try to magnify it. In childhood the children only remember innocence fully blossoming. So we the people who have loved them and praise him and He is very easily not the people who have hurt them. They don't want to remember perhaps. pleased. And whatever we have done grow It looks like that. But when they wrong, before coming to Sahaja Yoga, He completely forgives because He is up, they only try to remember the the Eternal Child. You have seen people who have harmed them or children, when you slap them, have troubled them. And that's how they make themselves very miserable. sometimes get angry with them; they forget it. They only remember the love and not what they have suffered at But the principle of Shri Ganesha is extremely subtle, is the subtlest of your hands. Till they grow up, they do not have memory of bad things done subtle. And it exists in every thing. to them. From the very beginning, a That it exists in the matter, in the form of vibrations.

So the parents must deity, among all the deities, and understand that if He is the giver of nobody can surpass him in His wisdom, there should be wisdom within me. And if I have the wisdom, powers. then I have the balance and I don't lose temper with children, but I try to We have to understand that as correct them in such a manner that children are growing Shri Ganesha they get corrected.

So it's the duty too much, then also they will behave in of the parents, who are Sahaja yogis, to see that they look after their children the same manner. in a way, in a detached way, to see So one thing is to be taught to your that Shri Ganesha in them is settled. The first sign of Shri Ganesha in a own children, as Shri Ganesha himself does, that respect your Mother. Your child is wisdom. If the child is not wise, if he is troublesome, if he does not mother means, your Holy Mother and know how to behave, then it shows your own mother. That is very important. If the father does not make that Shri Ganesha is being attacked by him. And these days, in the modern the child respect the mother, the child can never be alright. Because the times, as it is, children are very much under attack. Innocence is under authority comes from the father, no attack, and it is very difficult for people doubt, but the mother must be to make a fine line, as to how for to go respected. But for that it is very with children and how far not to go. important that mother must respect Today's lecture will be more the father. So, in the present situation concerning about how far to go with if you start fighting with each other, Shri Ganesha, as far as children are misbehaving and talking in a manner concerned, because that's very that's not proper, it will have very bad

What makes you feel get angry, with his disciples, but basically, what he thinks is that 'he is my protege, and I am developing him and building him'. But if the modern that now we are a means, we can say, an thinking is set, let them be individuals, instrument, a media by which we express let them be independent.

 33 May-June 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 5 & 6 extend to everything that you do. You has to feel that he is a child still, and there is the mother and the mother is should see what? Things that are good. Whatsoever has got vibrations. bringing the child, giving all the powers to the child, loving the child, Today, I want to tell you something understanding the limitations of the child, looking after all that. All the very important about this All Pervading Power we have heard about. These sweetness, all the wisdom of the child are nothing but vibrations. The Parma to be appreciated, that is vibrations. Chaitanya is nothing but vibrations, And if you see the subtle side of it, it's where all identities are lost, the mother not my child, its not only a limited thing because it is eternal, it is everywhere, is lost, tather is lost, nothing remains. It is just this vibrations, the subtle you cannot have it. In everything you do, I have seen people the way they Vatsalya; exists. And this is the only handle the things in the West. We thing, out of which everything comes and remains in itself. Like we can say. Indians also have to learn from them. that the sun's rays come out and then So we have to accept for that, what they try to create chlorophyll. So is the way to handle also beautiful it's not that you cannot compare sun with that. Or we can say that from the things. How to look after beautiful ocean, the clouds come out and they things, how to manage beautiful relationships? You shouldn't be harsh. try to nourish the Mother Earth. That's You shouldn't be unkind. You also, they cannot be compared. Everything is inside. This Param shouldn't see things which are insulting to others, so that the Chaitanya has got everything inside. So we can say that everything is relationships are maintained. So all the relationships that are between nothing but knowledge, is nothing human beings and God are through but truth, is nothing but light. But when the folds of it come out, then we get the Ganesha principle. So when it into the folds of that Chaitanya, then becomes relationship between you and God, then there are vibrations, we become ignorant. But there is and then the same relationship should nothing like ignorance, it does not

 34 May - June 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 5 & 6 In exist. Like there is darkness because In the same way, this Param Chaitanya acts and what we get lost is, there is no light. Once light comes, it (darkness) does not exist. So in our awareness, that is our Param Chaitanya. That is why, the play starts. ignorance does not exist. But The play starts, like, day before what happens that the folds of this ocean, into that people go and it is lost. yesterday's Puja, What did happen? Thus we understand one thing very We were sitting there, and it started clearly that we are in Param raining. So to prove, that I can control rain so it rained. Some people were Chaitanya. We are made by Param covering out.I gave a bandhan. After Chaitanya. All the time we are sometime, the rain moved out from the surrounded by it, only thing is we are puja to the backside. It was not raining sometimes lost in the force. And why, where we were sitting and after that it why we are lost in the force, because became the Sun and it was so cloudy. of our own unawareness. This Sun came, it became sunny. So that's awareness has to come, that we how, you have to become aware of the are part and parcel of that Param Chaitanya. The whole thing is called powers of Chaitanya. Now when you as 'Chid-vilasa', is the vilasa, is the give bandhan, what you do is, to put Chaitanya into action. Though you are, playful enjoyment of God's attention. Now you will say, how can that be? For suppose, in the ocean, but the ocean acts upon you all the time. You cannot example, we see the sun, I will just give a simele closer to it. We see the act in the ocean, you cannot ask the water to do this, to do that. But as a sun and then we see the water. We see the water in the lake. There is realised soul, you are empowered, water, and because of sun we can see now you can ask water, all right you dissolve. You do this, you do that. the water. Then supposing, we see the But for that, it is important to be the mirage and we think, this is water and masters. And to become the masters, we run after the water. But the whole thing is the play of the sun, whether it you see, like a matter becomes a is a mirage, whether it is water, human being, and from human beings they have to become masters of the whether it is the sun.

 35 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV issue 5 & 6 May-June 2002 now you are empowered and you can matter, and you handle the matter. So do it. It works out in everything. It we come back to the same. Like, agriculture we can handle, just by works in your talent, in your understanding, in your education, in vibrating, we can handle water, we can handle Sun, we can handle Moon. everything. Like there are some boys, who said, "Mother see we could not Because there is rapport now, we are solve our problem so we gave a aware, that rapport has been established. So all this play is bandhan. Immediately the whole thing extremely beautiful to me, I see it. But came and we wrote it down and there is the solution", It is happening with now you all have to know that you all have become realised souls and you them. have those powers. So in every action, in every thing, So all other non-sensical things you whatever you do, you should know, it is were indulging in, better give it up. the Param Chaitanya that acts. Only There is no sense in it. What ever is thing you have to be aware of your Self and aware of it, it acts. And you just sensible, you should do, because jump into that awareness and it works. there is Shri Ganesha within you, who is absolutely sensible. He is nothing That you have seen. But still so many but sense; He is the giver of sense, So people do not know. So many people still know from their brains, do not know He is the killer of demons as they say. He is the one, who removes all the from their hearts. And so many people even if they know in their hearts, they ordeals by improving our awareness. do not act in their attention. So only True, ordeals cannot remain, because these three things you have to improve, you give the bandan and it works out. Now, I asked somebody to write down one is your heart, another is your the miracles, and now he says, it has head and third is liver. If you can become voluminous. It is, because improve your these three organs, the before realisation, whatever looked Param Chaitanya will act. But then all like miracle, is no more a miracle. this attention about money should be given up. Param Chaitanya will create Miracle has lost its meaning. Because

It may not create money, because it does not have a way they behave towards themselves and others! All these things are to be mint, but it will create possibilities. And this is something to be understood very understood. Now that we have entered well and it is so blissful to know that into the Kingdom of God, means Param now you are aware of the Param Chaitanya, and that we are very Chaitanya, and you can master it. important citizens of that. If one can Master it is not in the sense that you understand this, then I think Sahaja can dominate it, but you ask it like Yoga can be very successful. 'Jinn', do this! Do that! With respect. Everything will work out miraculously, everything will workout. And all those But the way sometimes we do not pay who respect to Param Chaitanya, is also not aware about the are something surprising. The way we act, possibilities where they can reach? all the time, the way we are behaving! They are thrown out, in the sense in the Like in my presence, the people will folds, in the ignorance, so called, into the darkness.
