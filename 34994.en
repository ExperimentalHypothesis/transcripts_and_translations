How to speak to new seekers

Sahaja Yogis must understand because you must have that knowledge, how to neutralize these images and projections that they have built. Because they are very formidable things, and unless and until you learn how to do it, they won’t be able to understand you. So, you have to be always as you say that “one up”. Now the first thing was the idea of illusion. Very interesting it is. Now for them, you see, there is nothing like evil, nothing like bad; everything is an illusion for them. So why talk of evil? Why talk anything against the gurus? Everything is an illusion. All right. Now let Me see how will you answer that. Who can answer? To a person who talks to you, how will you answer? Tell Me.

Sahaja Yogi: I think [we can] feel on Your vibrations and your hands is just not an illusion. Then it’s real that you can measure things.

Shri Mataji: No, no. But you see this is different. First, I mean you should start from the point at they are, still on arguing point. Not yet they have feeling any vibrations, or anything. So then, how will you tell them, if they say that is also an illusion? You can’t talk to them about vibrations to begin with. You all are at a very different level that you don’t understand. Must know that your levels are changed completely. You are talking from a level where they are not. So now, how will you tell them that the devils are there, and the satanic are there and there is negativity and all these things.

Sahaja Yogini: You get them to [log on and see OR lock and] how it’s working in our lives.

Shri Mataji: Oh, then going into big discussion. They’ll say that, “Oh, that we have seen.” You see, they all think that they can take their own decisions, they can have their own ideas. Another idea is that they will say that, “It’s all an illusion, you see. You talk about all these things, they’re illusions, finished.” Now they will say, “Look at your lives. All right, we look at our lives as illusion.” Then what do you say?

[Hindi] Ha, let’s have it.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, supposing You can tell their vibrations to prove it.

Shri Mataji: No, no, they haven’t felt the vibrations. They don’t know what is vibrations is. You see, you just confront them as they are. Vibrations are different things. They haven’t got it. They haven’t felt it. They have not known what it is. Then how will you discuss? You see, even you meet them. [Hindi] When you just meet them and you confront them, then what will you say?

Sahaja Yogi: [unclear] what are the questions.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Here you see, Americans or anywhere, of course, Americans are the top-listed people in this that they have their own images and they have their own conceptions. Now one of the conceptions is that everything is an illusion, you see? So, how can we say that somebody is a bad guru or a good guru or how can you say that there are evil forces? There’s nothing like evil because it’s all illusion.

Sahaja Yogini: Now I can say that this is my experience with it.

Shri Mataji: No, no that’s very personal. Would be arbitrary. Because they never had any experience, nothing. Then, on mental level, they....

Sahaja Yogi: Maybe we have to go to the physical level with these people and tell them that it’s something like that they can quit your help. You can go down to their level and get their intention by help maybe, then peaceful, [unclear].

Shri Mataji: No, no, they are not willing to go on to that point. They are not going to ask you to give you Realization or anything. They will just, ha. Now let’s see.

Sahaja Yogi: You tell them to look at any other Scriptures that are accepted. You tell them to look to any other Scriptures whether they are Christians.

Shri Mataji: But if they don’t believe? Say, agnostic. I mean, we have all kinds of headstrong people over here.

Sahaja Yogi: What about the decorous, the way they [lead/lived] their lives and the examples [that/of] their disciples whatever they [did/were doing].

Shri Mataji: No, no, for them evil is not there. Even they are leading that life, is an illusion.

Sahaja Yogi: You can only judge, Mataji, from your experience, your own experience.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but supposing without that, [Hindi] without that on mental level, if somebody confronts you, what will you do? Supposing face to face you see somebody comes and says this to Me, “Oh, I think this is all illusion. Why should we worry about somebody’s bad or somebody’s? It’s all an illusion.”

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, can’t You tell what is from within because Your vibrations?

Shri Mataji: But they don’t want to listen to all that. They will say this is myth.

Sahaja Yogini: Who created the illusion?

Shri Mataji: Aaaa?

Sahaja Yogini: You could ask them if it is illusion, the illusion has to be created. There’s a Creator.

Shri Mataji: No, they will say, “Illusion exists because we are ignorant, but to me it’s an illusion.”

Sahaja Yogini: To become [more real]?

Shri Mataji: Aaaa?

Sahaja Yogini: To become [more real]?

Shri Mataji: He becomes the, he has to become the reality. But to him, you see, that’s also is an illusion.

Sahaja Yogi: Now You can please tell us, Mother.

[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: No, no, you have already. I’ve told you now. You have to tell because I’ve spent so much time with you now. Will you please tell what I told you?

Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know if I can repeat the same way You said to me, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: All right, I’ll tell. See, when you are just discussing something on mental level you cannot talk of something of an experience and all that. Nobody is going to listen to you. So, you have to go on the mental level itself, and there you have to convince a person. So, you should say that, say, a man is in a boat, all right? And he sees the waves of the water, is the ocean. So, to him it’s an illusion because it doesn’t affect him. All right? But supposing you are in the water, then it’s not an illusion. So, you have to achieve that state of mind where it becomes an illusion.

Another good example is, supposing you are watching the television, all right? Then there is a fire, you see. You are seeing the illusion. That fire doesn’t burn you. But supposing you are, there is fire already, will you put your hand to that? You won’t, because it’s not an illusion for you. So, you have to achieve that state of mind where the thing is an illusion, which you do not have. That’s what we are saying that you have to achieve that state of mind where it looks like an illusion. Then they will realize that their state of mind is at a lower level and they have to raise it to a higher level because it’s not an illusion for them actually. You see the point now? How to explain it. Very simple is that for a person who is in a boat, for him it is an illusion. But not for the person who is in the water.

This is one question. What was the- another question I’ve explained to you? It was a good question I explained to you, on mental level it was. So, I’ve said the second. The first one is not coming anymore. Aaa. Then which I explained to you, there’s another thing. It’s the idea of people is this, that you see I’ve asked somebody, “Why do you like Freud so much?” He said, “Because he was new.” So, to a Western mind anything new, “Oh, we should do it. Why not? It’s a new thing. Let us do it. If anything is new, then we should try. Why not try?” But trying whatever it’s new. So, for this, what will you explain?

You have to give a concrete example.

Sahaja Yogini: The example of a natural plant’s growth. Plants grow the same way as they always do. Human beings have the same natural way of growing. And...

Shri Mataji: No, no, but how will you say, “Don’t try anything new?” How will you say that? This is the mistake of our Western society is they tried everything new. Hippie-ism came, hippies. Now this cocaine has come, cocaine. Tomorrow something else; we have that. Paint your hair, paint your hair, paint your nose, paint your nose. [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Anything new they want to try, “What’s wrong?”

[Conversation in Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: Power of discretion “nahi hai” [No, it’s not].

Shri Mataji: Aaaa?

Sahaja Yogi: Power of discretion...

Shri Mataji: No, no, but how can you say to them if? You can’t be blunt with them. To say, “You have no discretion,” they’ll say, “You don’t have.” So, you can’t be blunt, but how cleverly you can tell them. Concrete example.

As
I told you the other day, I think you missed the point. You have to
say, “All right, plastic is new. Try plastic. You make a plastic
flower, all right? And you get this flower. Which is, which is the
right thing? This one. Why? Because it has evolved from a tradition.
It has evolved from a seed into a tree, into the, and there you see a
flower; it’s a living process. All right. But plastic is new, but
it’s plastic; it’s dead. 11:40

They also tried plastic, used to have plastic everything, plastic this and plastic that. Now they are fed up with the plastic. They don’t know what to do with them. So, everything new, when you try at least see that it has some traditions; it has some basis.

Now all these people you are trying “shaktipar”, this, that, nonsense, you see, they have no basis. But it is never written in any Vedas, anywhere, in any Shastras; this word it is not there. This arunupaya, tarunupaya, karunupaya, all that, it’s not written anywhere. It comes suddenly from somewhere, from this Theosophical Society. This Theosophical Society is only hundred years old. All this nonsense is a hundred years old. We have never heard of such thing. Even Ram Krishna, dancing like that, you see, wearing a sari and all that, one has never heard of anybody doing like that. So, from, from where does it come? Suddenly a new thing, and all that new thing is accepted by the West. It is not described anywhere, not talked about, take to any Vedas, take to any Puranas. Anywhere it is not described.

Nowhere it is written that Kundalini it’s a dangerous thing, nowhere. Even Kabir who was, I think, about sixteen hundred years back has not said that. [Hindi] Mohamed Sahib ke baad aaye. [Hindi] Eight hundred years back. Mohamed Sahib has not said it sixteen years [unclear] back, sixteen thousand years back, sixteen hundred years back. Eight hundred years back Kabir never said it. Suddenly, I don’t know how the idea that Kundalini is very dangerous has come. So, all such new things have also come in India, like tantrism, erotic these things, and they went away. Because all such new things what people try go out of the circulation of your evolution. They are just thrown out. They are not accepted. In the same way, all these gurus will be thrown out. In these twelve years you have seen all gurus are exposed. You can see how wrong, what wrong they have done cause also it has effects, because if you take to something which is just new you see the effects of that, like plastic. When, when they said that first bomb fell in Singapore people had never seen bombs. It was a new thing. So, they came up to see, and they died. So, one has to understand that whatever we call new, may not be good for us. So, this is the second answer. All right. Now, another, third question; let’s see if you can answer this one.

Sahaja Yogis: We haven’t done too well so far.

Shri Mataji: So, trying everything new ventures, new things, one must have a traditional idea about that. Like a man who takes to new business suddenly, does not know anything about it, its tradition, its background, anything, suddenly takes to new. He is not going to be successful [Hindi]. In the same way, anybody comes out of the blue and says that you stand on your heads, why must you? You should ask, “Why should we? Why should we do this hassle? Why?” No, because it is new it’s acceptable. So, the two questions are clear-cut, I hope, in your minds now, very clear-cut should be. Now the third question, let Me think. Trouble is, in your presence I also don’t think. What is the third question you asked Me? Just trying to remember. You have forgotten all the questions. You only ask Me these questions.

Sahaja Yogis: Bad memory. It’s very difficult the thing when You are missing, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Third question is, I don’t remember what they did ask. No, I don’t remember third question is. I’ll remember later. Then I’ll ask.

Sahaja Yogi: Was it about the destruction, Shri Mataji? About the collective manifestation of Shri Kalki or...

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

Sahaja Yogi: About Shri Kalki. I asked in [unclear] about the big wok.

Shri Mataji: Ah, that one? That is only for Sahaja Yogis. We can’t tell all these things to others but for Sahaja Yogis. Like he asked Me a question that, “If this is the last chance, then what’s going to happen to the rest of them?” So I said, “In the beginning, of course, we’ll try to get them to India, do whatever is possible, but even if they don’t understand and they play games with themselves, then we have to cut off.” Then another world for them is created. And in that world they’ll live. They’ll have all human awareness, but as described by many people [and/that] it’s true they’ll have burning sensations in the body. Is described like this: a big wok will be there, there will be boiling oil and they’ll be put in that and fried, and they’ll have their awareness there and they’ll suffer all the pangs, and this is one of them only.

There are thousand and one styles they’ll be tortured. Horrible things they’ll have. That’s what you’d asked Me. Ha. Now, so the other question like that, that they will say that, “But, see we have advanced so much, you see.” They all think, “We are very advanced people and we are so developed and this and that. We are so much developed, and all thanks to our psychologists and thanks to our scientists and thanks to other people that we have come up to this level,” you see. Many people think that now they have achieved their freedom also because of Freud, so-called freedom. So, what’s wrong? What’s the answer?

Sahaja Yogi: So today it’s the question, do you feel free?

Shri Mataji: Do you?

Sahaja Yogi: Do I feel free? I feel free.

Shri Mataji: No, no, the question is this. No, no, the question is like this. I was just talking. The question, if somebody asks you, then what will you say?

Sahaja Yogi: I would say, “Do you feel free”? If they say that, “I feel free because Freud gave me my freedom,” I can turn around and say, “And you feel free?”

Shri Mataji: Then, they’ll say, “Yes”.

Sahaja Yogi: If they say, “Yes”, oh then, it’s wonderful because they have found a nice [terminal?]. But I don’t believe it.

Shri Mataji: That’s a, that’s a different point. You see, that’s not.

But how to convince them?

They will say that, you see, “We have advanced so much. India has not so much advanced. We are very well-to-do people. We have solved our material problem. We are developed people,” this and that. I mean, they are quite cocksure about themselves. That’s why they talk like that.

Sahaja Yogini: I would ask them how much peace and joy they experience in their own life.

Shri Mataji: Oh, you see that, they will say they do experience. Then what can you say? You see, these things cannot be proved you know, Ursula? You cannot prove it.

2:40:50

[Cut in the audio] (audio 4)

So, you, “We will be joyous. You see, you have no fun in life. We have all the fun. We have all the pleasures; you have no pleasures.” They say, “You dress up in a way that’s very, sort of very cumbersome.” Anything, I mean they, they have ideas about things, you know. They are sorted out, according to them. Their dress is very sensible and not to have the dress is even more sensible. Then, what will you give them, a concrete example?

Sahaja Yogi: [Then/Though], we can say if they are so free, how come they have to depend on a chair to sit on it?

Shri Mataji: It’s all right. They say that chair is all right. We can make the chair for sitting on it. What’s the harm? I mean, that’s why they are developed because they have comfort. They don’t, should not live like primitive people sitting on the ground.

Sahaja Yogi: They’re slaves to their cigarettes and...

Another Sahaja Yogi: If, if they are on an aircraft and, and they, they are thinking that they are free to travel to Spain and they are there in that travelling and you are telling, “You are not travelling. You are just sitting there. The aircraft is not moving and I can prove it to you.” So you, you can. They’ll say, “Yes, in twenty-four hours I’ll be there.” Then you say, “No, you see in twenty-four hours I’ll prove you that you will still be here.” And they can; they can believe whatever they want. But the aircraft isn’t still moving.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but, but it’s a fact. They are richer people. They are much more comfortable. They have much more yarns in the heads than the, these poor Indians, or any other person, you see. “Why should we be saints?” They can’t understand. What is the advantage? You see, for them everything must be valued, in advantage and disadvantage.

Sahaja Yogini: I would say, “If you are so free, why can’t you go for walk, for walk in a park at night?”

Shri Mataji: Why don’t you?

Sahaja Yogini: Why can’t you walk in the park at night if you are so free?

Another Sahaja Yogini: For fear that you might be [attacked].

Shri Mataji: But they can say that...

Sahaja Yogini: They have no freedom, [though they think] to be free.

Shri Mataji: No, they’ll say that even, you see that fear that one has, everybody can have, because in the park somebody can rob you.

Sahaja Yogi: No, independence and pleasure in [just playing with] some other objects not within.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] This is our theory that there is something within. But concrete proof you have to give this mental being. They don’t believe supposing there is another life, or a better life.

Sahaja Yogi: Happiness is a state of mind. I, I believe happiness is a state of mind.

Shri Mataji: Then whatever you believe they will say, “I’m not [interested]”.

Sahaja Yogi: No, no, I’m talking about people who are materialistic. They have, you know, I mean, what they want, and if they are happy in that state of mind, that’s their life style. But it’s the way we understood life that...

Shri Mataji: Yes, but how will you convince them that they should take to our life? How will you convince them that they should take to our life, that we have a higher life than theirs? How are we higher than them? Because they think they have fun, they have more pleasures and comfort. How do we have to tell them that how are we on a better part than they are? This is the point is. [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: Well, we have more senses than what a normal person has.

Shri Mataji: What? What do you have?

Sahaja Yogi: More senses we have developed.

Shri Mataji: No, that is, that is, supposing they don’t know about it, that you cannot convince them. Not [related/relative] to you also, if you have to just tell them what has gone wrong. See, what you have to say that, supposing the way we have developed would have been all right, the human beings would have become better human beings. In these thirty years’ time, thirty years back human beings were much better than they are today. We are, we have become so violent. I mean, in this New York now city you can’t go alone anywhere, with the purse in your hand, you see. But thirty years back it was possible. Thirty years back you could go in any park, into any park. Nobody would murder you.

So if this material life has given you any satisfaction, materially if you are better off, then why people are stealing? They are corrupt. They are trying to cheat. Why, if you were going the right way? We have to become better people in the sense we should be more compassionate, more understanding, of a nature that is congenial to everyone. We should become people of greater wisdom, but there is no wisdom in modern life; there’s no logic. With the science, what have we achieved is an atom bomb. We have put there like a devil, sitting there, one atom bomb, carbon bomb, hydrogen bomb, this bomb, that bomb, to be blasted any day. People are just waiting to put their finger on the button.

So, to say that we have advanced is a wrong idea. It’s a myth, because human being has not ascended. Primitive man was afraid, say for example, of a tiger. One can understand, but now modern man is afraid of another man. So as human beings our quality has gone down. So whatever we have developed, maybe the matter has improved in quality, but human beings have fallen down. Now we have to improve the quality of human beings. Now, what should we do? So, for that Sahaja Yoga is there. [Hindi] Concrete proof.

Sahaja Yogi: We have to become innocent again.

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

Sahaja Yogi: We have to become innocent again.

Shri Mataji: Yes, we have to become but that, to get that innocence back you see, how to get, they will ask. Then you say, “There’s a way. We have become ourselves. We have become better people. We were not so good.” Then they will come to you. And our children are going to be much worse than what they are. They will start killing their own parents. I mean, they are already killing so many. So, what life we got, we are giving much worse life to our children. So, in every way, whatever advancement we have made, might have improved the conditions, comfort, or whatever it is, but human beings have not improved. That means these things are not required to improve the conditions of the [human beings].

Human beings are very treacherous these days. You cannot trust anyone. I can tell you, thirty years back you could trust anyone. You had much better friends. You had much better people. Nowadays you can’t even, I mean, a Sahaja Yogi may not be able to trust another Sahaja Yogi. The situation could be that bad. I mean, a saint, imagine saints, born Realized people can smoke, can drink. This is Kali Yuga. So, what have we achieved, this kind of a horrible atmosphere where only satanic forces can reign. That’s proved it, all right? So, we are no more compassionate, we are not sharing, we are not enjoying each other, but after Sahaja Yoga, you get back everything. All right?

Sahaja Yogi: Many things.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
