Public Program. Santa Cruz (USA), morning 18 October 1981.

Last night I was really very happy to meet you all and I was thinking how I could reach you so spontaneously. It is a great thing to cherish the moments of meeting you. I went into your beings, to your problems yesterday. That Gregoire has said that you all have got mostly the left sided problem not so much the right side, means ego is not so much there as your left sided problem. And the left sided problem is the problem that comes to you because of certain mistakes you have committed in your seeking. So doesn't matter, it can be worked out. The basic of the left sided problem comes because I think you didn't get the love of your parents also in your childhood. One of the biggest problems is that of the mother's problem that you didn't feel that security when you were a child, to begin with. It's mother's side. Left side is the mother's side. The another thing could be that when you went into the society they tried to create diffidence in you by their own norms and ideas about life, you see their idea of successes is very different from the idea of a seeker. Because for a seeker the only success he can have is when he has found out the truth. See that's what he is seeking. And if one child is born who is a seeker in a family who don't know what a seeking is, they are just seeking money or something else like that which is very superficial and nonsensical for a seeker. The diffidence grows in him gradually in the sub conscious and he starts thinking that are we mad? Or is there something wrong with us? Or are we something strange people? What's happening to us? So how is it that we are so much different from the rest of the people who are madly doing other things and so much involved and we do find them funny.

So the left side starts getting accumulating that diffidence within yourself. Then you find some friends who are with you or find people who talk the same language of the thing that they are seekers, they have to seek and they have to seek something. But the another diffidence that starts afterwards when you become a group or sort of, this whole thing becomes known to the people who are selling in the market. We can say who are in the market. Who are just trying to mobilize their money into new channels, wherever they can make some money, you see. So if these people when they come to know about such a group, which is still uncertain, does not know, How to go? Where to go? What to do? You see it's a very vulnerable society. Very vulnerable society because there is nothing established. They don't know what to do? If they realize that these people are wasting their time, that the people who are doing other seeking like money and all those things, they understand that but they cannot also understand what they should do. So it's a very vulnerable, a very risky type of a life they lead. And in that risk the first hit comes when they give up their parents, you see. Because when, they are because of the parent's attitude towards them, they have to give. And the parents in America, I was surprised, are really not at all kind to their children. They have only rights, they have no duties, I feel. I mean it's just the other way round you need. They have no duties for their children. They are rich people, they don't look after your, I mean their needs, nothing. It is something surprising, the other day somebody told Me that a story that if the son is having a party or something, I mean enjoying himself with his friends. Then if he puts the music little loud, the mother in the other house would ring up the police and call ... and ask the police to arrest this fellow. I mean this is the country I can't imagine. In India, on the contrary if the mother if she knows that boys are going to have the party she will go all out, prepare something nice for them and how to make them happy. and she would disappear from there so that their age group should enjoy themselves. I mean this is a very common practice in India. So many such things you know have crawled up because of, I think war. I would place it in one of the things is war. Because of war your parents got disturbed and they got upset. Let's also give them some praise about it. All right so they were all very much frightened and disturbed and their nerves were broken. Let's take it like that. Now whatever it happens, then they also, the material advancement, so called, through your industrial development came through. All right. That also puts such a pressure on them. I mean if somebody has a TV you must have TV. If you don't have a TV then you are a gone case. If you have some plastics then you should have some plastics. They have some nylons you must have some nylons. You see this competition was in accumulating these things all the time and the machines they were trying to create more and more of this nonsense because they are hungry things. And so they were consuming all the Mother's earth and converting it into all these nonsensical things, which now is a big mountain and it is a big problem for you to how to dispose them out?

And the other thing, the people in the households were trying to compete with others in this kind of a nonsensical pursuit. You see the whole thing was a chaos for you, because you are born with a different, different awareness within you because you are awakened to a fact that material things are not going to give you joy. And this is what was difficult for you to convince your elders. And the elders also got into the funny ideas of Freud, I should say, and all the people started writing books about nonsensical things, how to treat their children, how to behave towards them. It's something absurd I can't believe. It's shocking when I hear. I mean there was a girl in Switzerland. She told Me that my child who was only one and half month or something like that died, Died in his bedroom. I said, in his bedroom? I can't understand what is that? She said we don't let children sleep with us. I mean I can't understand. You just can't understand how can you leave? I mean you can't sleep - your children are not with you. You just can't sleep, you are so worried. And this is something you see from the very childhood if you are left in another room, you feel... I mean you must be frightened.

And I don't know what must be happening to you. I mean when I give you realization I am even worried about you. What' going to happen to these children who, are born realized. I have to leave somebody here to look after you, to consolidate it, to manage it, to make you go otherwise you might be frightened. It is really, it is so. With this one feels very much disturbed and whom to blame? You see, you cannot blame anyone. The whole thing, you can say, it was to be like this. So accept it as it is. But it has harmed you on the left hand side. So to begin with, in your psyche, I would say, the problem started from the right from the time with them. Now you to clear that with your choice. You decided to be born to these parents. You thought them to be sane people. May be your mistake. And then you took your birth in this great country which has also got some great disadvantage no doubt which I will tell you now what is the greatness of this country is, why you were born in this country.

And then thirdly, that you have to live with your own nature, you could not take to the nature of other people and the difference between the two, the gap was so great that you just couldn't manage it, you see, and you have to get out of it and once you are out of your home you are absolutely vulnerable to these people who are attacking you. Because you are not yet matured enough to face them. You are quite young. And you are suddenly attacked. Your innocence is attacked. Then now you should not do this to your children. That is very important. But, now the children are going to be very powerful people. And look at the matured ones sitting here, just like the great grand old mothers. You see. They are watching the things like, when I went back, these two boys, one without a shirt and one with a shirt standing there. I said what you are doing here. They said we are looking after all the crooks who are trying to go inside. And we are protecting You from them. These two little things. One was so big... they put all their toys there to fight, you see, all the crooks that are going in they are all standing there both of them. So it's like that. You see, this great children are to be born, no doubt but in between is your generation which is a very important generation for Me because you are the foundation of that great kingdom, the kingdom of God. So you are also very important so the first thing you have to do as I said to say that "Mother I am not guilty". Do not take anything upon yourself. Say that "Mother I am not guilty". You don't blame yourself for anything. Alright first thing.

Secondly is that the left side gives you a kind of a diffidence, it's such a vicious circle you get a diffidence, all right? Because of diffidence you do not get your realization, maybe. Even if you get you realization you go little bit coming little bit going, you see all the time and you get more diffidence. Then the vicious circle starts. The diffidence again stops your feeling the vibrations, again you get into diffidence, you start blaming yourselves and hating yourselves again it goes in a very bad vicious circle. So the first and the foremost thing for all of you is to have complete confidence into your faith that you have to seek something beyond. For say this is the first faith you should have. That you should seek something beyond and whatever you are doing, you are doing in this, may be mistaken. Doesn't matter. But your aims were correct. Your aims were perfect and your aims were correct. All right!

Now the second thing you have to know in yourself that you are not all these things like the worldly things you see but you are the Spirit. You are the Spirit. Now believe that you are. Do not have diffidence because you have failed so far, doesn't matter whatever has happened. Ultimately if you find it, you find it. So second thing you have to know, second thing you have to know that you are the Spirit. This is the second point and I was, gradually, yesterday strengthening your left side of which you are not aware. Perhaps you think that you are very egoistical. Some people think like that and that this is the ego. But mostly this whatever ego you had is also finished because the way they were bumping at it, you see so it is hurting and it may become a guilt within you ... "Ooh I should I have not done this, I should not have done this, I should not..." No use worrying about these things. No use going back onto it. So because of this you see the left side, which is a very important side in Sahaja Yoga, is affected and it starts right from the Swadhisthan. In the Swadhisthan Chakra. As I have told you that I am going to tell you about your Chakras but more relating to the left side. Left side, as Gregoire has written a book "Advent" in which he describes it as the sin against the Mother. And the right side it says the sin against the Father. Not the mother who has given you the birth, but the Shakti, the primordial Mother. The power of God's Love. Sin against Her is the left side and the sin against the Father is the right side. So countries which are developing now like India, you see, they are trying to develop into your style they are going to have plastics and nylons and everything. Then they will take to drugs, then they will become hippies and then this will happen and, then I have to give them realization. Before going all this circle they are not going to listen to Me. They don't want to short circuit it. You see, so them go along with it. They are now developing. All these countries are developing they should come and see you and meet you and know what development has given you. This kind of material... you are understanding so well, but they will not. If you tell them they can't believe.

You will be surprised when I go to India I have to take nylon saris for them. Though we get very beautiful silks in India and they don't think much about it. They think, why don't you bring some nylons for them. So this is what it is. You see they don't understand. And this is the thing I told you that Kundalini is in India but they are not awakened. You people have realized the value of matter. You people have realized that matter doesn't give you the joy. You have to go beyond it, specially nylons and plastics. At least this much you understand. But you go to any sophisticated Indian family they will give food in stainless steel. Though they may have glass they think, Ooh stainless steel is great, you see. All the rich people will take out their stainless steel. Even if they will have silver they think stainless steel is great. Can you imagine? So, this is the state in this they are, while you have reached that state where you do realize the aesthetics, the aesthetics of the matter. Aesthetics of the matter you understand. So you have in one side, on the right side, you have achieved quiet a lot, I should say and it should be confident on that style at least that you understand the worthlessness of all these man made things. That something so great to achieve that you want to have something that is God made. Once you come to that point you should also know that if you have to have realization it cannot be man made it has to be God made.

Now the left side is important here so I will talk about left side. But you should not feel hurt about it because I have to point it out to you to understand the mistakes and the things which should not be repeated. But the right side mistakes are committed as I told you in the people who are developing. So I will mention you to do that part what happens to the right side when we commit mistakes on the right side. What we do is, we don't believe that there is God who is your Father. You forget that there is Father above you. And He is the one who is going to look after. So you don't have to worry so much about earning money by any crooked method or by any means without any values to earn money. To be worried about money, to be worried about your well being is absurd. Krishna has said Yogakshema vahamyaham. He said you get your yoga. If you get your yoga then you get your kshema, which means your well being. The other day somebody asked Me what is the way to Lakshmi? - is first to get your yoga. Why didn't he say kshema yoga .... He said yoga kshema vahamyaham... first yoga? First you get united with your Divine force and then your well being is looked after. It is looked after. Even if I tell you the stories of that you won't believe to what extent it looks after your kshema also. You don't become Mr. Ford because that's madness. You become a person who is provided for, who is looked after and who never feels the dearth that there is no money with you. That's what is, kshema is. In which your health improves, material things improve, everything improves once you have got yoga which is promised by Shri Krishna six thousand years back. I am not saying something new, it was said about six thousand years back. So you become a realized soul. By becoming realized soul you realize that your Father God almighty is the richest man in the whole world. He has everything. From where does it come? It comes from Him. Riches that we think are riches not really riches. The one He gives you, the one He provides you are miraculous. These are miraculous things and when it happens.

I will give you one example for you. Like in London you see we didn't have any place for the boys to live and girls to live in and they want to form an ashram. There was a lady who bought a place because she had sold her place, she bought a place - dilapidated, ruined place in Lambotwale. Of course you will be surprised that William Blake has said, because I laid the foundation there, and he said it that the foundations will be laid in Lambotwale. He said that England is going to become Jerusalem and he said in Lambotwale the foundations will be laid. Imagine this William Blake and his prophecies. I stayed first in Surrey Hills. He has written that the first beacon will be lit in Surrey Hills. Can you believe this man, how good he was in prophesying? Whatever it is, this ashram could only provide rooms for very few boys and girls and big problem for them. So they said Mother we have to have some more places to live and what are we to do? I said, all right, now you pray for it. Just ask. And a boy came up with an idea that we should form a co-op. So they were not willing to form a co-op. They said Mother it takes 10 years to get a nice place in co-op. It's useless. I said if you say so just go ahead. So they formed a co-op. Can you believe within one month's time they got a huge building, with 15 large bedrooms and big halls and all that for them to stay paying only 70 pounds for the whole building, in one week, can you imagine? Then after a month they got a huge big, very-very big hotel with all things there - beds and linen and cutlery and crockery and everything that you could think of paying only 70 pounds per week for all - such a huge big thing. There about 25 people can easily live and they have got halls and basements and this and that. We had 16 marriages on the Krishna-ashtami day. And all these newly married couples stayed in that hotel very nicely, paying nothing, because they didn't have to pay there. But these boys ... I don't know what they did among themselves. But this is what it is. This is the truth. And, such beautiful atmosphere in that place. Everybody enjoying the pure knowledge and the pure love.

Now, we are on the left hand side and when I will discuss about the Chakras. I'll be dealing, pertaining more to the left side. And not the right side, which is the side which we say, is all material well-being or say how do you get your physical well being. You also get your physical well-being through this.

Now as you see here, the first Chakra is very important. Because you see the connection is established in the left hand side, is a very, very important center, is the center of your innocence. The first thing God created on this earth was innocence. And this innocence is embodied in a deity whom we call as Shri Ganesha. This deity was created long long time back, much before anything started on this earth. The omega and the alpha you can call it. And He incarnated on this earth as Lord Jesus Christ. I was told that I have to be careful because there are many people who just don't believe in Jesus Christ. This is a very big conditioning of people because they are born in families who don't want to believe in Christ. Whether you like it or not He exists, not only He exists but He is the only one who can really give us the path from here. So the first one is the center of our innocence. And this center of innocence was kept there at a position where it manifests in the gross - our pelvic plexus, which looks after the excretion of the body. As there are four, we can say the petals of this subtle center, in the same way there are four sub-plexuses for the pelvic plexus. I don't know how many have done medicine here. But the pelvic plexus has got four excretory sub-plexuses. One of them is responsible for sex. Now the idea of sex that has come to us is from people like. Mr. ,say, Freud. Now look at his life. What sort of life he led. He had bad relations with his own mother. He is a perverted fellow. Secondly, see, look at himself. In his own life he should see the light of a person. Then secondly that he had cancer for years together and he died with cancer. So, physically he was nonsensical, mentally he was a pervert. Yes! I mean you must see the person whom you try to follow. Alright? So, it's so logical. Now, you see his life as it is. He taught you, "Oh that if you try to condition yourself about sex and if you marry someone and you're married to one person and then you are attached to conditioning of the society." But he was half baked. Because you are not on your left side, see, if you say that, what's wrong if I do this? What's wrong if I do that? What's wrong if I do that? If you go on like this, then you forget the other side. Which is the ego. Which is the ego side. And then the ego side develops, and then you can become a mad person. Then your sex can be a problem. Today the sex of modern people is such a problem. We should face it. Perhaps you do not know that what a percentage of American young people are impotent today. They are impotent. The more you become impotent a viscous circle is created and to you sex becomes so important that you think you have to become just a sex point. No more a human being but a sex point. All the time you talk of sex, sex, sex, sex. What is the need? It is such a subtle thing. Every animal knows, everyone knows. Nobody is given education about it. In India we never talk about it, we are producing much more children than you are producing here,

That's also another reason why we produce more children is. The load has to be borne on us,because children don't want to be born here. The conditions are so bad. In England two children are killed. Two children. Can you believe it? It's allowed. Two children are killed every week by parents. I mean I can't think of one parent in India, who will do that. One! And we have poverty and we have everything. But no mother can kill her own child even if she had 12 children, she wouldn't mind. Mind is not the thing, she loves them. She can't afford to lose even one child. I mean it is another extreme we have, like we can even sell our country for our children sake. We are to that limit. You see, some of the people are so attached to their children that they don't mind. For their children's sake, they can sell their country and that's going to another extreme. But, I must say that children would like to be born in India, not here. So we are carrying the load upon our self. But, the main thing is our sex ideas are really being conditioned by this so called de-conditioner. When they say do not condition yourself, actually they de-condition you, they think, but they are conditioning you much more by saying "do this, do that". You see, sex you don't have to run away from that. You don't have to get out from that. Not at all. But sane ideas must be developed about sex and you have to lead a very good married life. Married life is the blessing, blessing of the Goddess on you. It is Grihalaxmi. The way you treat your women, the women treat you. The way, I mean it's a reaction. You see. The men treated them so shabbily the women are becoming mad here. I must say they are getting mad. You can't live without men. How can you live without them? It's impossible. You see if you think you can live without men, you are sadly mistaken. It's a wrong idea, you can not. And men can't live without women. Now you might say there are people - I was amazed also, another amazing thing that I heard was that 65% people in California are homosexuals. It's something shocking. It's another thing. Because it's perversion . Now why it happens?

I had a boy in New York who came to Me who was like a boy, he had mustaches and everything, but talking like a woman, you know. I said what's wrong with your ... First I didn't understand, you know, then they told Me, "Mother he is something like that it is that and that. I said all right. But actually he was possessed by a woman. He was possessed by a woman. I removed that possession and he said now I look like and feel like a man and he started walking in a different way all together. He changed his gait and everything and he was walking in a different way. Just imagine it was just a possession of a woman on him. So he was behaving like a woman and he was seeking a company of a man instead of a woman, which he should seek. That's the normal thing to do and he became abnormal. Now when they became abnormal nobody is there to protect it, nobody is going to tell them that this is abnormal. This is nothing that you should say this is insane, this is illegal, nobody is going to listen to you ... if you tell human beings this is wrong they will sit on your head they will never do it. Never tell them this is wrong. Tell them, this is right, go ahead with it and they suffer they will come back.This is the way our modern society is working towards it. All right! You want homosexuality, permit it. You want killing, permit it. Whatever you want you do it. They have a feeling behind that that, once you allow them to do what they like, either they will be finished completely once for all. Headache is gone, or once they realize, they will come back to normal. I think this must be the basis for everybody not going into it and finding out that 65% people are suffering from such an absurd thing which is not at all joy giving. It's never joy giving. It just ego pampering. Because some women told Me, "Mother these men are so dominating and they are so horrid and that's why we should not have anything to do with them. All right. And they try to push us here and there and they try to harass us so we have nothing to do with them. We'll have ladies together." I said, that's not the way. You should know how to handle them. They are very sweet. Oh! They are extremely sweet, you should know how to handle them. They are like children. Absolutely like children. But you have to be a real mother to understand them. They are so sweet you can't imagine. They are extremely sweet and good people. Same about men, I would say, that the way they see the women are sort of dominating them and all that. There are ways of handling the women of that kind also You can manage that. You see you have forgotten the sweet methods of romance. See now the romance depends on the ring you wear. If a woman is wearing a particular type of ring that man falls in love. She changes the ring the love is finished. These kind of artificial ideas if you have about your relationship with each other - if it is the hair you like, if it is the eyes you like and all that - it will it will not last. But the feeling that we belong to each other, just we belong to each other and we have to love each other, then you don't see this difference in each other. You don't' find this disturbing. Not at all. I mean you need not be with the husband all the time but you enjoy the separation and then you enjoy also the meeting. It's not that if you are away from him you are posted ... not at all. It is a very sweet thing that happens to you and can happen to all of you when you are realized. Once you are realized, you come to s normal position that the whole thing normalizes. You see because that is the absolute point. That's the thing that takes away all your imbalances, all your problems and you really know what is love. What is enjoyment?

This Gregoire, is the one who came here with all kinds of nonsensical things here. Today he was telling to Me other day that "Mother you are the Master...Master of fitting all the pieces together in a very nice integrated manner."And, it's true that it is the Spirit in you that ... just brings back everything, that all looking so ugly and so disintegrated into one beautiful full and all the romances that you have heard of. Now I mean such a romance for his wife, he is so romantic that nobody can believe that he a modern man. A modern man is not supposed to be romantic about his wife he can be romantic about anybody else's wife, but not his wife.

So this is the absurdity of our ideas about love. This is [NOT CLEAR] of our own. Why not enjoy your own thing it's like enjoying somebody else's thing. Like in India, you see supposing you get an Indian, he may be a thug. He can come to your house and run away with your things, you know. May run away with all your things, that you have collected. But if you get another one, a western man in the house, he will run away with your wife only. You don't know what he will do. He will talk very sweetly and run away with your wife And he will say "Oh! I have done such a great thing, she loves me."And he is not bothered as to the whole system of your family is finished. The whole thing is finished. Like we had one boy, a journalist, he was 26 year old and his friend was 24 year old and he invited the friend to his house. I mean the friend, he came to the house. His The mother was 48 years old and she ran away with the friend. And four children were left behind and the father didn't know what to do. She had a divorce and she got the house divided. The children are thrown to places. I mean this is absurd. How can you do it? And she came to Me, "Oh! I'm in love with him, Mother". I said, "This little boy, who is younger to your son. How can you be in love? Are you mad?" She must be mad to believe in such a thing. And the fellow was interested in her money, perhaps, maybe. I don't know what he was interested. But they were in love, supposed to be in love. I don't know what sort of a love is this one. See how can you be in love with your great grand children. It's absurd. You know this is so absurd, you see, this eighty year old people trying to copy with you. Going in a pub and dancing like you with their shaking hands and everything shaking and collapsing next moment. What is there to compete with these young children? You are grown up, you are matured, you are sensible, you are sane. You enjoy that. It's so funny thing, you see. In these - modernity - we have gone very much away from reality. That's why we are away from joy and enjoyment.

All right so this is it, that sex is to be used for its right purpose and to be used at its right point, means at the Mooladhara. Christ said one thing. He said, it is written, "Thou shall not to commit adultery". I say, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes." Because He knew this would happen and He is placed at that point where He controls thoughts. Nowadays we have started doing sex with our eyes, this flirting business. What do you get out of it? Looking at this girl. Looking at that girl. Looking at this girl, that girl, what are you getting? Your eyes are ruined. Your attention is ruined. You're finished and [NOT CLEAR] up. And by the time you have seen 20 girls. You will sit down and say "Aah! This is the best way to age." And then you go to beauty clinics and try to look younger. See what is the need to look at these girls like this; they are all your sisters. Have purity in your heart. There is no need to waste your attention so much. There is no need to waste your attention. For an Indian we will be looking at the thing and you will be looking at the women or the men. You finish your choice at a point. You finish it and enjoy it. Even in guru shopping you do the same thing. You have come to Me now, I have told you the truth. But tomorrow another guru comes in, let's go and have a look. If you have that kind of a frivolous idea about yourself Sahaja Yoga is not going to work out in you. You have to settle down with it. You have to work it out. Your Spirit is to be completely uncovered and is to be brought into complete consciousness of it. You should really become the master. Unless and until you are master you should not give in and don't go to these people just to look at them because you spoil your attention. So doing sex with your thinking leads you to impotency. If you have to eat food with your mouth and if you start eating with your nose, the mouth will be finished because it is frozen and the nose will be finished too and you won't be eating either. Whatever things have to do, whatever ways you should allow that organ to work out that thing. So that's why the spontaneity in sex is lost. You think about it, plan about it. How can you plan, I just can't understand. You plan about everything that is so spontaneous and that's why there is such a problem. And people talk here as if sex is something out of the blue. It is there, it exists and you don't have to learn about it. It is all there. And to talk about it, is also it is not necessary. It is your own private. It's absolutely private and sacred thing between you and your wife. That's all. Nothing beyond, nothing before. It's a very sacred thing. The more sacred it is the more you enjoy it. I have known people in India who are 90 years of age and still very potent. One gentleman came to tell Me that, Mother, my wife has died and I am till ... I don't know. I said it's all right. How do you manage? I told him how do you manage? He said I am living - in her separation I live. That's how they live. And they manage themselves. While here the people at a very young age just become exhausted and finished.

So we have to understand that in Sahaja Yoga, you try, it will work out. It works out. Also gradually your attention will be stationed. You will be very much in the center and you will definitely get your innocence in such a beautiful manner, just like your innocence. Can you believe? Completely you become so innocent and so simple that you are amazed at yourself. Your innocence is there as far as money is concerned, no doubt still you are intact on that point. On that point Indians are not. You are innocent as far as material things are concerned. For example you don't mind giving all the money to these horrible gurus as long you get your realization. But there I think the innocence is not stupidity. How can you give money for your realization? I mean it's a simple thing. You must understand you cannot pay money for your realization, one thing you must understand. Anybody who says, now I have got vibrations, some people go to someone and feel heated up. Then they want to get heated up more and more and more. This heat is coming from that man and is going to increase your heat all the time and it is going to increase and increase and increase and your Chakras are going to be ruined completely by this manner. It has to be reduced. It has to come to the cooling point and you must feel the cooling point. If you cannot feel the cooling point then you must know that this man is absolutely wrong. When you are feeling heat here, now for example, it is because the cleansing is taking place. Once the cleansing is over the cool breeze must flow in and you must feel the cool breeze. Now some people might feel absolutely cold, just like frozen, that's also not a good sign that means you are left sided .Some of you may feel that kind of a thing. It's not the feeling. It's the cold, is the point. It is the feeling of the cool breeze, is a breeze like feeling that you get. From My photograph also you will get. That's the way you have to judge yourself. You judge yourself, establish yourself, keep your Chakras clean and you will be amazed how you become a master of the whole art. You will be able to give realization, each one of you to thousands of people.

So now in the second Chakra when we come, I would say the Chakra of your seeking. And we call that as the second Chakra, because the third Chakra comes out of it. Is the Chakra in which you seek. It starts from very very beginning when you were a human being you did not realize that you came to this stage in thousands and thousands and thousands of years. First of all, as any animal, what you do is, to seek God in food. You just seek food. You are seeking food and want to eat and the whole thing is at Nabhi level, is, at this point where you are just seeking the food. How to nourish yourselves? How to look after yourselves? The second seeking later on starts. Some of the animals start becoming more alert by understanding that you have to be more intellect, so they start seeking in power. They want to power other animals and slightly overcome them so that they can eat them, so they seek-in power. Then the seeking goes even subtler and subtler, that they start seeking in money, as human being starts seeking in money, possessions and things. Animals don't have possession, thank God. Because possessions means head ache. You have to have insurance, you have to have this, you have to have that. So the human beings start getting the possessions and all these things and they start really into this seeking. But the last and the foremost seeking is of the very evolved, is the seeking of the Spirit - the seeking of God. This is the real thing that should happen to us. When you are at that point, at that point of maturity then this happening takes place.

Now the other center that is coming out of that one is ... actually it's not shown here. but it comes out of that, actually comes out of here, is the center that is called as Swadhisthan, is the center by which you think, you organize for the future. You think. You organize for the future. You work out your action through it. Like we think, think, think, think all the time, what we do is nothing but think. I mean planning is such a curse that we don't do anything about it, we just plan and keep it in the book. Oh! we have planned it. They think we have planned it, it's done already. It's not so. Now this thinking gives a realm of future into which we are entering. When we start thinking, we do not know how we imbalance ourselves.

In this area... this area ... resides the principle of the Primordial Masters, as Gregoire has told you. Now, when you start thinking, this center- the one you see, which is the yellow colored center - transforms the fat from your stomach for the use of your brain. Now people are so much against fat these days that it would be really dangerous to talk for it. Now from where are you to get the replacement of your brain cells? Tell Me, if you are not going to consume any fat and it is your livers are out. So whatever fat you take, you take any amount of fat, you will not have any weight, try, because that fat is the reserve for your brain which thinks all the time. You have to ... You know ... Do you know that this brain is made of fat cells? Do you know this or not? ... Is nothing but fat cells. In Sanskrit it's called the medh. And the whole thing is called medhi, even the brain. Even your nerves are made of the fat cells. Now when you don't take it, any form of fat, any form of fat whatsoever - I mean I am told that lots of butter is lying here wasted. I don't say that you eat the mountain of it, no, no. What I am saying if you don't take it at all any fat, then what you do is, to make your body starve for the fat that is needed. For one of the purposes is the brain and for your nerves. If you don't take fat in the body you will be a nervous person. What is the supplement for your nerves? What are you going to supply? That's why you find, you see, mostly to make it out a westerner and an Indian is very easy. You make them stand before any calamity. All right? Indian will be silently watching. The another would be going indoor completely The will say, Aah! Ooh! HA Ha! Everything will be coming out or the eyes will be twisting, the nose will be going up and down and ears will be going out like that. They will all be nervous. The reason is your nerves do not have any sustenance in it. That's lost because you just don't take any fat, take little bit, not I'm not saying the mountains. You see, if I say something. you may jump into the mountain of fat. That's not the point. Not at all. But just to avoid completely the fat is a wrong idea. Creates an imbalance. Now this poor center has to do double job. Firstly it has to supply the fat to the brain, secondly it has to look after your liver on the right hand side, when it moves to the left hand side your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys and the uterus.

All these things this poor thing has to do. Now if you are thinking, thinking, thinking all the time then it is trying to find out all those fats whoever it can get from everywhere to supply in the brain. Alright. And if, it does not get that then it is a dangerous thing. But even if it gets it, then it is creating a problem for the other organs which it has to look after. That's how people get diabetes. You don't get diabetes because you eat sugar. It's a wrong idea altogether. I don't know for why the doctors have started this kind of a thing. For example, in India people take sugar at least half a kilo of sugar per day in the villages. At least minimum. They eat more sugar than they eat rice. Take it from me. But nobody has diabetes. Why? Because they don't think. Whatever sugar they take is used for their liver. Now if you do not give your liver any sugar, now ask anyone, how the liver acts. Liver is the one that takes out all your poison. Now this poison is to be taken out of the liver by water. Now if you take the water and drink on top of that, what happens that the hydrogen becomes heavier. I mean there's H3 added to it and the whole system of H2O which has to be neutral becomes like this and you can't receive any heat into it. So the whole heat which is the poison, accumulates in the liver, you get all kinds of liver problems. All kinds of liver problems. Practically most of the western people have liver problems. But they don't know it, till they discover it. Till they are absolutely on the verge of something very fatal, they do not discover about liver. Now this hydrogen which pulls it down, you see, becomes like a arrow doesn't receive anything from the liver - the heat and such a person never gets any temperature. Even cancer acts the same way. In cancer also, the H goes down very much though it's a left sided problem, which I'll tell you. But same thing happens that the heat of the body cannot be taken out by water. So the water becomes a heavy water, you can say. But after realization, the hydrogen goes up like that. And you receive all the heat and people who have bad liver feel terrible heat on the right hand side.

Now you have to take carbohydrates to neutralize that heat. You have to take carbohydrates. If you don't like sugar, eat rice - I mean if there is some sort of a thing on your head. This also is an enterprise, I must tell you, these food stores are also another enterprise which is very, very subtle. Very subtle enterprise. You see, as you had another enterprise of the gurus. Then you had a holiday, you see. Some idea must have come. Then this hip ... what you call it - singers, musicians, the four of them, Beatles. You know the one who created them, Beatles. His uncle had told Me the story. How he did it. It was all maneuvering, to begin with, and that maneuvering makes people mad. And that madness is still on. You see people go on into that. It's all auto-suggestion and all those things they work it out, their psychologies, you see. And they know how to maneuver people and how to dominate. They know. And they maneuver it. They work it out on your weaknesses like you do not know about food. Now some of the health foods I ate, it was not for human beings, it was for buffalos, I felt. Really. Some of the foods were so hard and so harsh, I got such a pain in My stomach I said now this is not for human beings, this is for buffalos. You are not buffalos. You are human beings, you have to eat food which is digestible to your stomach. Of course that doesn't mean you should use this white bread. Of course that is not the thing, which makes your liver completely sort of or you can say the intestine sluggish. But you should not eat all the harder, of such a hard things like everything you cut because you want to preserve the vitamins. You will cut everything and eat everything like that. Japanese are the worst. Japanese are the worst. I mean there is nothing that they don't eat. They eat everything that you could think of. I mean you can't eat the food the way they eat. First thing they served Me on a very special banquet, where the princess was there and all that, was a shell with all these moss around it. You see, for us Indians as it is, a little fussy about these things and My daughter said "what is in there"? And they said, "live thing". I said "live"? We were all frightened, what is "live". They said oyster or something which live inside. And the poked it and it started doing like that and you see...oh God how do you eat it? And the Japanese just twisted it out and ate it off, you see. And they eat everything wrong. There was a boy who was eating peanuts. I said what are you eating and he said I am eating these frogs. He was just peeling them up and eating them nicely. Can you imagine? This is the way they eat their food which is not meant for the human body. You have to cook, but your women are so busy with liberation, they don't cook. They don't cook. You should learn to cook, to handle your husbands. You see, if you know how to cook, it's very simple.

In our Sahaja Yoga center, we teach them how to cook, because if you know cooking you are the master. You see, people are, men are really so simple ... I cook very well. I'm an excellent cook I should say. But a gentleman came to see Me, he was a German and he told Me that there was one chairman of a cart... Catherine, that she told me, if you want to eat the best chicken, ask Mrs. Srivastava to cook - that's My another name. And, She is an excellent cook. I was surprised that this reputation all over that I cook so well... chicken. And he came all the way, you see and he brought the chicken with him. And he came all the way to cook with Me and to eat it and he was a very big man also himself and I was amazed to see that just to learn, how to cook the chicken. He said my wife doesn't know how to cook. Just imagine how helpless he was. All men are helpless as far as food is concerned. If you give them good food, you see, they may say oh! we can eat whatever we like. But it's not so. If you know their taste and things and if you know how to handle them, it's very easy to handle them. Like, somebody told Me Indian men are very great cowards. I said "why?" Because they don't know how to cook, that's why they don't divorce. [NOT CLEAR] to say such a thing. It's not that. They are very wise. Process of changing every day a wife, you see. One wife is, she knows all about your habits, she knows everything, she knows how to cook for you. It's a good idea to carry on very well as companions. Every time if you change, God knows, she may come as a shrew, she may come as anything. You may lose your head with somebody, another will break your hand and another will break your leg. It's better to know one and handle her for this lifetime. So next time at least you don't face that type. It's very simple and wise way of living together, to understand that in one lifetime, only if you live with one person you develop that love, that attention, that understanding because human being basically are very good. If you live with somebody for two days, you will just see the superficial things of that person. That may not be good. So to get to the depth of a person, it's necessary you live with that person with a loving care, you see that person and you will discover how beautiful that person is.

He is so beautiful sometimes that you are surprised at yourself. The other day I had to go for something to a hospital. I mean, I never go to a hospital, but something happened and doctor said after my life You must do this, You must do that. And My husband couldn't see that. You see, he was so upset. He has never seen Me like that. So he went back to his office, he put his head like this and he was sitting there didn't do any work or anything. When he came back, I was angry with him. I said what do you mean by not being here, I was here and there were other people. But actually I knew what he was doing. So I went I told him, I know you ran away, you coward, you couldn't stand here. He said it's true. You know, I couldn't see it. And then his secretary told Me he was horrid. He wouldn't talk to me, he wouldn't allow me to do anything. That's what happened. So, to understand a man is such a great thing ... to love. I don't know if you realize that. It's such a great thing to love. To give. It's much greater than to have. Giving, I don't know if you've tried or not. All My life, I have done nothing but giving. And I think I feel so happy about it. The real source of happiness lies in giving only. Not in taking anything. It's such a great thing to give. Give. Give. Give. And you'll be amazed you'll have no dearth of it. That is what one has to understand. But to think about what things I should preserve, what things I should give. What is there to think? If somebody likes, have it. Doesn't matter. It works out.

Now, the second center, is also of the Lakshmi center, because, you asked Me to how to get the Lakshmi. Now this is the center of Lakshmi, because Lakshmi is the deity of this center. And the deity actually, who is the male side of it, is the one who is the kinetic side. The power is the potential side and the kinetic side is the male side. So, Laskhmi is the power of Narayana. Narayana is the deity, whom you call as Vishnu. That's why Vishnu only incarnates. Because He comes for our seeking. He incarnates. He incarnates to give us our higher awareness. Always the Vishnu incarnates for the aspects of the human kind. And that's how we have been evolving one after another. For example, when Noah's ark was built, it was Vishnu who came in the form of a dolphin fish and saved that Noah's ark. And that's how, we were saved. Then, a tortoise form it came in, to make the fishes come to the shore and start crawling on the mother earth. Like that, a leader is always born and that leader is the aspect of God, is the incarnation. Now, many may say we don't believe it. So many are like that-"we don't believe it. Don't believe in that. Don't believe in that. We believe in this and we believe in this". How can you say that? First of all know that you say this because you are conditioned for something. You have a fixation. When you say I believe in it or you say you I don't believe in it, you have not reached your absolute awareness. Have we? How can we judge? You cannot judge. So, you have to become that. Once you become that, put just your hands and ask the question "Was Vishnu an incarnation? Was it the aspect of incarnation that gives us our realization?" You'll start getting more breeze and more breeze. And then you'll know that it is so. But this fact about Vishnu, that He exists, you will only know after your realization. When you raise the Kundalini and if the Kundalini stops at this point of Nabhi, then you have to take His name. If you don't take His name, it won't rise. That's why the mantra is a very big science. To know first of all how the Kundalini is moving. You can say the mantra is like, give it very gross example, is like a toll that you pay at every point. So, when you go up to a gate, now you have to pass through that. Then you pay a toll. But somebody gives you a mantra before realization, it has no meaning. Because you've not started moving as yet, your car has not started moving as yet. How can you pay the toll? Whom are you paying the toll? You're just paying the toll to the guru, who is nonsensical .You have to go to that point where your Kundalini has stopped. Which you can see yourself and feel it. And then at that point, you have to raise the Kundalini higher by saying that particular mantra. Then at higher level and at higher level. How the mantra is to be said there is a science. This all can become yours in no time at all. In within one month's time you all will be experts of Sahaja Yoga. Take it from Me. When I went to Australia, I was hardly there for a month I think, and within 15 days, see these people from television and all that they came to see Me. And they said "Are Your disciples all scholars?" I said "Not at all. Who told you that?" "Oh they know so much!" I said, "Because they have become knowledge now." You start learning from others when you start giving Kundalini awakening and all that. You start learning what's happening. Where is it going, how it is working out, how to maneuver. Unless and until you start driving the car, how will you become the master of the car? In the same way, you have to know everything, working it out. Not thinking about it. Then people start analyzing. How can this be? How can that be? It's not analysis, is actual working. Actually you work it out. Things flows from your hand and you're amazed. Oh God, the Kundalini is rising! Yes. You can see it's come up. You can give realization. Those who got realization yesterday, today they can give realization. What do you say to that? You are that fantastic. You are that fantastic. That know, that you should not be shifty people. They say that Americans have very, very shifty people. And be careful of this character. So everybody has a sign. Like that, you have a sign that you are shifty. While English are hard nuts. So, be careful. Do not be shifty. Settle down on your own Spirit. Work it out. Learn about it and fix it up.

I'm happy to see Michael has come all the way from Los Angeles. I was sorry I couldn't ring you. The other day I was feeling very sorry. And to see you here I was so heart-contended and I was so happy that you have come here to work it out. You see, that's how it should be. Alright. So, we then go, I mean there is so much to be said about every center. And you know that I've given at least 500 lectures in London alone. And there are tapes of My lectures. These are available. I mean we don't make any profits as usual, but you must also not exploit us by taking the free tapes. You should pay for the tape itself. Alright? Buy some tapes and you can get the tapes from these people. We'll send you. You can copy it and give it to others the way you want to spread it. You can use. There is no restriction on anything, but one thing is definite that you should not sell it at the profit. As I do not sell it for the profit, you also don't sell it for profit. There is no exploitation of the disciple and no exploitation of the poor Guru who is standing before you. Now, before we go to this another center which is very important within us. It's the center; I don't think I'll be able to finish it today, the whole thing. But at this point I'll stop. And tomorrow I'll talk about this two other centers and the Spirit. Alright? Tonight. I'm sorry. Tonight. So, this center is, the center of heart. Here the Jagadamba, the Mother of the Universe resides. The one Who is alone. She is alone. She does not have any male deity with Her. She is alone. She is the Mother. And She looks after the people who are struggling in this ocean of illusion. She is the one who is the protector. She incarnates. It's said that She has incarnated 1000 times. She has incarnated many a times. Now this Jagadamba is the one who resides there at that point. And when you are a child, say about 12 years of age, She creates the antibodies in the sternum bone. And these antibodies spread into the whole body and protect you from the outer problems. Now, those people who have the problem of this, especially in ladies, comes from insecurities in life. If you're insecure, then you get the palpitation and such women at the extreme can develop breast cancer. If you can re-establish this, breast cancer can be cured in no time.

Now the other centers which are important, this is of the Father and the Mother on both the sides. Now the Father, is on the right hand side, is the one by Shri Rama. Shri Rama and Sita who came on this earth, They are not standing in the center, so you can see very clearly that They are not worried about the evolution part of it. But, They came on this earth to establish the right conduct of a person especially in the political and the economic field of life. How to be an ideal, a philosopher or you can say a benevolent king? He tried to establish the symbol of that - Shri Rama. And those people who suffer from father's problem - supposing the father has died very early, they have this problem. And the symptoms of that is you get asthma. You develop asthma. If you have any problem of the father - if your father has died early or if your father is torturing you or if you have no respect for your father, if you are a bad father, I mean, the fatherhood itself, when it is challenged, you get these problems and asthma develops. Asthma, what you call that a breathing trouble, problems. It could be with the combination of that right side heart and also Vishudhi, but mostly it is the right side heart. It could come by the Vishudhi. Now, the left hand side is the Mother's thing is the Parvati, is the wife of Sadashiva, which resides there in Her form as the Mother Annapoorna or She is the one, giver of food. She gives you food. When She is in you, you find that if you cook for two people it will last for as many as who want to eat that. It's like that. This is the deity that comes when it is awakened. It works out. Now when the, this Swadhisthan Chakra is the one by Bhramadeva and Saraswati. Those who are students for them it is essential to get this, because they are the Gods and Goddesses of your arts like music, dancing and all those things. Also, they give you the power of truth, in the sense that - if you have a good Swadhisthan, then if you say something it comes out true. Your vani, means your tongue, your vani your voice, your tongues that you speak becomes the truth. Is the power of this one. With the Lakshmi tatwa as I told you, you get your affluence wherever you go, you bring affluence. You go to any house people get affluence. You touch anything people become better off. All the problems go out and if you have problems on this, whatever you may try, you'll never get rich. It will be always a problem and you'll have sort of losses and things like that.

So the left side [Vishudhi is the Vishudhi...uh... Mother probably meant Nabhi not Vishudhi, thus Vishudhi not considered as the right word - Ed.] Nabhi, which you catch very often here, because of drugs. Now I must warn you that left side Nabhi gives you also problem with money. Always with money. Because if you have got left side problem, the Lakshmi just disappears. She just disappears. If you go more on to the left hand side it is even worse. So alcoholism and all these things take you to a state where you start losing money and you can become very much poor with that. So the poverty comes in with that kind of thing. The right side Nabhi is the one that gives you liver problems and gives you a very dominating nature, may be, or a temperament by which you get very much active. Left side Nabhi has another very serious problem, which is a very serious one. Where if your spleen gets affected, for example people who are very jerky type, having their food then they are running to the work. This can happen to the people who are right-sided also, because they are very speedy people. They are working. And then they want to eat the food at the same time, think about something. They will attend to many things at the same time. And this spleen has to look after all the emergencies and has to supply the blood cells. Because of this kind of a frantic temperament of a person, what happens is the spleen becomes fatty. And then, the serious disease like blood cancer comes in. Moreover this is nothing, because there is an anti-Christ, who has come in this country, settles down here. He is a Hitler, sick, sick, sick , who gives you also blood cancer. So, it's a very serious thing and all these things only takes place when you are not aware of it. You do not know. It can be cured completely with Sahaja Yoga. No doubt. It can be cured by your Kundalini awakening. That's the only way you can cure. Sahaja Yoga. There is no other way out. But you have to first of all know how to manage your Kundalini. How to raise it. But the first thing you have to do is, to give up some of the fixations you have. Because it's a new venue you are entering into. And like any scientist you should keep yourself open, absolutely open, and see for yourself and know for yourself that you have to understand everything, everything in such a way that it should be logical. It should be logical and through your vibratory awareness, not by your thinking. First you have to understand it and logically you'll see it is true. So, it is you who judge yourself. It is you who understand everything. It is you who grow. And it is you the one who grows seeds, also thinks. So I give it to you, all these things to happen to you, within your own wisdom and in your own freedom. All these things should be done. But just now I won't say "Don't do this and don't do that." You'll just give up. Just like that. Because once you find your Spirit you'll never bored. You have no time. You are enjoying yourself so much; you have no time for anything. Even for smoking you forget. That's how I am a very tricky person. I said no use telling them,"Don't do". Otherwise they will never come to My programs. Let them come and then I'll manage. Then you'll start really saving money on these nonsensical things, nonsensical habits that you've got. You want to get rid of them, just works out. So for the time being I think today it's alright. But in the evening time, I'll tell you all the rest of it. And we have got luckily here two persons who are here to stay. She was in London and Michael was with Me. Who are deciding to stay in Santa Cruz. It is she who brought Me here. It is she who gave all these ideas. I mean it is now her responsibility to see that you all are put on to the right path and that without challenging your ego, she should do it, because it can be dangerous also. Because she is one of you and so you may not like it - her telling you something. So don't mind. You'll become like her also. Don't feel that there is something aggressive about her. That is very important. Because with Me it's alright, because first of all I am a Mother and also I am something different. But for her you will think she is just like you. So doesn't matter. You'll become like her. And you can also give Realization to many. Thank you very much. May God bless you. So, any questions? I'll answer these.

Sahaja Yogini: "You were talking about the second Chakra the one that is green here."

Shri Mataji: "No. The one that is yellow color, which gives us, you see, the path of ascent. That it goes round. It's like a lotus. Have you seen a lotus stem which has got a stalk? The stalk is in the third chakra. It comes out of there. And it goes round all over, supplies energy [NOT CLEAR] everywhere. It can bend down. So this is the Chakra which is flexible one. Swadhisthan. Which is actually the Star, Star of David. Star of David. It's the one which Moses and all these, things they have built it up all that. This crossing of this represents the crossing of Moses, the river that He crossed. Of the sea, you can say. All that is represented here. Because the Sea of Illusion, you cross. It's the work of Moses Himself. It's Star of David"

Sahaja Yogini: "Will You explain the difference between self-consciousness and self-realization?"

Sahaja Yogi: "The difference between self-consciousness and self-realization."

Shri Mataji: "I don't know what is self-consciousness. But self-realization and self-knowledge is the same. But self-consciousness what I learnt, My own Indian English, I would say is that you are very conscious of yourself. That you are very particular about your body and your mind. There is another word for that in English language. Is that vanity? Something. That's different. Self knowledge - atma boddha - knowledge of the Self.
One by one alright. One here, one there. Alright? "

Sahaja Yogini: "Last night I went home I would feel like vomiting. [NOT CLEAR].And then I went to bed to go to sleep. it was terrifying."

Shri Mataji: "Why? What happened?"

Sahaja Yogini: "Well, I was having nightmares."

Shri Mataji: "The first day you may have. Because you see, there are spirits around. They will try to dissuade you."

Sahaja Yogini: "We came ... an image of my mother [NOT CLEAR] and she was killing herself."

Shri Mataji: "Your mother?"

Sahaja Yogini: "Yeah."

Shri Mataji: "It can be anything. You see, what happens sometimes when you sleep, I mean you must have had first of all very deep sleep. That's when it happens. But when you come out of that sleep sometimes, you pass your subconscious area in the beginning. And, that impression that you awoke in your sushupti, that means in your deeper sleep you are not there. But you just remember what you've seen in your present subconscious mind. See and you touch that. But afterwards you get rid of that. No problem. It happens."

Sahaja Yogini: "Also I want to ask you a question about you said last night about drinking. And people become alcoholic, are they possessed by negative forces?"

Shri Mataji: "They could be very much."

Sahaja Yogini: "OK"

Shri Mataji: "Because you see, they go to the left side. You see, if you drink, you go to the left side. You are in a vulnerable state. Then, because you enter into an area, which is unknown to you is the collective subconscious. And people can attack you, you see. It is possible. Like Michael himself could tell you after Realization, he started seeing ... the way they were there. He could see them. And then he could fight them better because if you become something else then you can fight them better you see. Otherwise they are in you till you become mad, you don't know. They are there."

Sahaja Yogini: "Also, is that all passed on from mummy to child?"

Shri Mataji: "Very much. Very much. Very much. No doubt. You see you share them even from your friends sometimes. That's what people don't know when they deal with other psyches and things like that, they don't know that there is a way of protecting yourself from this. You have to protect. It's very subtle. They are just like diseases. They spread and they can attack you. They can get into you. It's very simple. It happens. Like I said, he and Evan, they just announced their marriage. And she had been to some clairvoyance and all that. They were all in her. She didn't know. She got her Realization alright. The day the marriage was announced, they couldn't bear it. That happiness of his wife, you see. They all came back. She got so possessed; she started looking like a mad, talking like a mad. It was a big problem. They had to come to London to get it alright. ...

Yes they are there. You can fight it out. No, not difficult. [NOT CLEAR] get rid of it. So just don't worry, alright? It will be alright.

So this gentleman, what have you to say?"

Sahaja Yogi: "Yesterday You talked about your body is a temple of Gods and I noticed that You were drinking coca cola. What is that You like about it?"

Shri Mataji: "It's perfectly alright. You see, I can even take poison. No problem. You don't compare yourself with Me, alright? ... I have to take poison also, I am so [NOT CLEAR] . So don't compare yourself with Me. But this coca cola is not so bad, as people talk. I can tell you. It used to be very bad. Before that they were making, about say 2 years back, I couldn't take that. But there is something wrong with it. I think it is some sort of a ... also I feel, I don't know, but maybe some sort of a enmity. It's sort of an enimity that it is very popular. Maybe people are trying to say something. But nothing goes wrong with Me when I take it. If it was poisoned, I would know that it is poisoned. But something's so wrong with it. Because see, I don't know whatever they give Me, I eat, drink, I don't mind. But of course not the alcohol. Even if I take alcohol, nothing will happen to Me. But I would not take it. Because I don't need it at all. I'm already in the Spirits. I don't need it. But now, I would take it. I don't think there is wrong with this coca cola. It used to be bad once upon a time. I would say about a year back or so. I never liked it. But now I don't mind because, it's something they add in it [NOT CLEAR] it's some sort of a ..."

Sahaja Yogi: "Too expensive to put cocaine in it now;"

Shri Mataji: "Now I don't think they put cocaine, oh very much they must be putting cocaine..."

Sahaja Yogi: "They used to."

Shri Mataji: "Huh... now this is it . Alright. So there's nothing wrong with it... That's it. Now how many questions?"

Sahaja Yogi: "That one that fellow over there."

Shri Mataji: "Of course now this one is ... first of all which one is bad. Because the seventh Chakra is the Chakra which has got 1000 petals as shown here. When you cut the brain in the transverse section you can see it's like petals - petals of lotus. It is said in the Bible that 'I will appear before you like the tongues of flames'. And these are the tongues of flames. Of course all the Chakras look like tongues of flames. Very silent. Very peaceful. Very soothing. But seeing is not the point. 'Being' is the point. If you see them, it's no good. You have to become. And becoming is that, you feel the whole thing coming out of your head. And these have the light. But you need not see them. There is no need to see the auras. Only when you are disintegrated, you see the auras. When you are integrated, you never see any of auras. It's being experimented. People who take drinks and all that, their auras goes like that shaking. But a Realized soul, if you take the photograph of a Realized soul, there will be no aura around it. But, if you are disintegrated, for example if you are taking LSD you might see aura around Me, around everyone. That's not good. That means you are not there. You are in the supra conscious area, where you are seeing the elements that are surrounding. But once you are integrated by your Realization, all these 7 Chakras get integrated. In Sanskrit, there is a very good word for integration it is 'samagra' means, 'agra' is the hole in the needle. So all the needles have holes and the thread goes through that. So all the Chakras get integrated when you get your Realization. But actually this area has got all the Chakras. Now I'll show you where they are. This is the Agnya as I told you. This is the Agnya. Agnya Chakra. This is the window of the Agnya chakra. But inside the brain it is - Agnya Chakra.

Then, you got the Vishudhi Chakra here, which becomes as the Primordial Being. Here as the Virat. Then is the Heart Chakra here. Then is the Nabhi Chakra here. You can feel it. If you have bad Nabhi you can feel the pressure. It's here. Here. It's here. At the back, here the whole is the Swadhisthan. And here, at this point, at this point, in the center is the Mooladhara chakra. Now, you will be amazed when you get diabetes, why should you have your eyes weakened. What is the reason? The reason is when you get diabetes; your Swadhisthan Chakra becomes weak, as I showed you there - that you get diabetes there, down below by the Swadhisthan's exertion. It presses on, it presses on, in the center of the Mooladhara. Mooladhara is here in the center, which controls your eyes. I mean eyes is the same as the power to the eyes. The light to the eyes. And once it starts oppressing it, you start losing your eyes. Your eyes are no good. Even if you're possessed. If you're possessed, also same thing will happen to you. You will have your eyes, but there will be no light. You can't see. All these things can be cured through Sahaja Yoga. It's very simple. The methods are very simple. Which you can learn yourself. You can cure others. You can become the masters.

Now about the Spirit. As I told you, the Spirit resides in your heart. It is the reflection of the aspect of God which you call as God Almighty or Sadashiva. Because God is one. But one person now, I'm one, but I'm a wife, a grandmother, I'm your Mother. I'm doing so many things. These are aspects of God. And God has got firstly, the aspect of love. By which He creates the power of His love, which is called as the Primordial Mother or the Adishakti. It is the same aspect, is represented in you as the Kundalini. You'll be amazed that even, even the Greeks knew about it. Because they called this bone as sacrum. Means the sacred bone. That means they knew that it was a sacred power there. Even, Athena, 'Atha' in Sanskrit means Primordial. And if you see the photograph of Athena or her statue, I've been to. I was so surprised. In Greece that they all speak [NOT CLEAR]. And She had this snake in Her hand representing the energy. When we see the snake, it is the energy. Not the devil or anything. But it's an energy. It moves like this and so she has the snake and also all the chakras in her hand and she's standing with a dress like that. That is Athena. It's very interesting. That place, the Delphi, and all that was so much revealing. And, that Delphi, they said is the Nabhi is the navel of the whole universe. Which is true also. And lots of things, I saw there, which I've talked in a tape you can see for yourself. Now this Spirit is the aspect of God which is a witness - the God that witnesses the play of His love. The first of all is the state where we call it, it is Parabhrahma, where everything is just silent and sleeping. When we are sleeping, nothing exists for us. In the same way the whole thing like Parambrahma, the abstract, sleeps. Then, it comes to Its awaken state. Then It wants to - It gets the desire to create - out of love. So, this power of His love spreads around Him, accumulates and forms another entity called as the Holy Ghost or you can say the Parashakti or you can call it also as the Primordial Mother. She is the Holy Ghost. Now, when the breath takes place, there is a sound. And this sound is the logo, as you call it, the Spirit, that is the sound, is the divine integrated sound, not one sound. And that one is called as Omkara, which is the child, which is the child of this couple and that's how you get the Son of God.

Now the Spirit in us, which is represented, is that son of God within us, which is the part of the, we can say God Almighty's reflection within us. Which is the child in our heart - is the Spirit; is the abstract, abstract form of that Power, which is all pervading - is the Spirit. Now, this is the combining thing. It has both the things. You can see that because it is from the combination of these a child is born. So on one side it is the reflection of the God Almighty. On the other side, it is the connection with the All-pervading Power, which is the power of His love. So it is connected on both the sides. So the Spirit is in your heart which decides, is alert all the time and knows all about you. In Gita it is called as 'kshetragya' the Lord of the field. He knows all about you and He knows what you're doing. It just is a witness. It doesn't involve into the play of what you're doing. It's just watching the whole drama, as long as It wants to. Otherwise, when It is now fed up or does not want to enjoy anymore, It just disappears. When It disappears, you do not exist anymore. This Spirit has got the nature of, as Caesar told you in the morning, Satchitanand. 'Sat' means that when you become the Spirit, you become the truth. Now, what is the truth? Truth is this all-pervading power. You start feeling it. You start feeling the truth. Now, this truth is absolute. You get connected to it. Your attention gets enlightened. And whatever you know through your attention by paying attention to it, means through your vibratory awareness, is the truth.

You put ten children together and ask them to feel that person, who is facing Me. They will put up the same finger. That means something wrong with his truth. Because you become the subject. It's not subjective but you become the subject. You start feeling, everybody feels the same. Now you have seen these people who have come to help Me from Australia, Switzerland, and England and all these places. When you come to Me, they say the same thing about a person. He is catching on this, he is catching on that. Everybody catches on the same. So this all-pervading power is a complete organization of delivering truth to you. You ask any questions whether it is true or not, you will know on your vibratory awareness. Of course in the beginning you have to develop the sensitivity. Once you are sensitive to it, you can find out the truth. So, the 'sat' that part means the brain gets enlightened. Your central nervous system gets enlightened. That means Spirit gives light into central nervous system and you start feeling It through It. First time it comes into your consciousness. Whatever people may tell you, that this is the way we give self-realization and all that, just don't believe it. You must know that, you should have, you should have the sensitivity of feeling that Spirit. And that truth which is common to all of you, that it cannot be denied. Truth is only one. It cannot be hundreds. Once you are realized, all of them talk the same. There is no difference. But the problem is human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. That's the specialty of human beings. Anybody who came on this earth, who are the realized souls, said the same thing. There is no difference whatsoever. But everybody started fighting about it. Like, the real flowers appear on the tree when they are living, they are beautiful, fragrant and they know each other. There is no difference between them. But somebody will take out one, another will take out another and say 'this is mine ... this is mine'. Then they are dead. Then they say this is it. When Christ lived nobody recognized Him. They crucified Him. Even disciples, till He got His Resurrection. Then what's the use? Nobody recognized Him. All the great people when they came here, nobody recognized them.

Christ has said "Whatever you've done to Me will be forgiven, but not to the Holy Ghost." Because the Holy Ghost has to give you your Realization. And when you get your Realization, you have to recognize It. If you don't recognize , that will not be forgiven. After Realization you have to recognize. If you do not recognize, He said it won't be forgiven.

A very, very great understanding is needed to understand what is today - Such a precarious time. The last judgment has started. So many great people are taking birth. So many crooks are taking birth to harm you. It's happening. How will you judge yourself? How will you judge? Are you going to report on a, what you call, a balance? Your Kundalini is going to be awakened. You yourself will judge. Not necessary for anybody to judge. You yourself will know whether I am catching on this, whether I'm catching on that. Today one of the Sahaja Yoginis said "Mother I'm catching on the right heart". Alright. We'll work it out. Another will say, "I'm catching on my Agnya. Yesterday somebody was telling Me "Mother please take out this bhoot from my Agnya". The Agnya means ego. They can feel it. They can see it and they judge it because they are out of it. The Spirit gives you the truth and you like it because the vibrations flow. You feel so peaceful and so happy and joyous. And you can feel others. When the vibrations are not there, you feel what's wrong with it? We should put it right. And, you can feel others. When the vibrations are not there, you feel what's wrong with it? We should put it right and when you know the method - how to do it. You want to do it and you want to feel that. The joy of the Spirit. Though really felt in a big way comes later on, but it starts trickling in. People give up all kinds of habits automatically. I don't tell them. They just give up. The will power is so great that whatever you want you can give up. There is no problem with it. So many people who used to take drugs - the druggists and chemists I used to call them - when they came to Me, some of them came in coma. They just came out without any difficulty. Because if you discover your Spirit, you just do it. A transformation has to take place within you. If that doesn't happen, it is no religion, it is no God. It has nothing to do with your Kundalini. And when it takes you become so empowered, that nothing can dominate you. No habit can dominate you. No guru can dominate you. No ideas and fixations and all these smaller things will dominate you. But you become so powerful that you start emitting light to others. And people can see that light in you, that confidence in you. Now the 'chitta'. Chitta means attention. Your attention becomes enlightened.
