TV Interview, Los Angeles, USA, 1983

Interviewer: Joining me right now is Shri Mataji and She is known throughout the world as a saint. And that's the first time that I have been able to meet a saint. And you're also a faith healer or psychic healer, I guess some people call you.
But when asked in a recent interview as to whether or not you were a saint or considered yourself to be a saint, you had a very unusual answer. Are you?

Shri Mataji: Actually, you cannot certify yourself isn't it as anything?
The quality of a saint is that he can make other saints. If he can make others saints, then he's a saint. Otherwise, it's just self-certification.

Interviewer: Can you make other people saints?
Shri Mataji: I think so, yes.

Interviewer: How would you define a centre? What would another person become that would make him a saint?
Shri Mataji: The person who becomes a saint develops a new awareness as a result of a iving process of evolution that he becomes the Spirit as described by Christ that: "You are to be born again". And in that, the awareness becomes its actualization. It's not just mental projection but actualization, that you become a person who is Collectively Conscious. 

Interviewer: You mentioned Christ and yet you are from an Eastern country being from India.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course! He plays a very big role in your evolution.
He is the gate as said.

Interviewer: So then by your definition a saint could be a person who might be a born-again Christian who might have taken the Collective Consciousness of Jesus into their lives?

Shri Mataji: You see, those who accept him mentally are not born again. Thought, it is a happening that has to take place.
Baptism is a happening and that happening takes place when there's a vital force within our sacrum bone which rises. You can actually feel the rising of that force it comes up onto the fontanel bone area -we'll be baptized- and you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. 

Interviewer: Yes, they say that there's a cool breeze
Shri Mataji: Breeze of the Holy Ghost
Interviewer: That people feel.
Shri Mataji: Yes

Interviewer: And another interviews that I, that I read about you said that the interviewer who interviewed you, that you put your hand above  the interviewer.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Interviewer: And he was able to also feel the cool breeze
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. And also from the [hands]
Interviewer: Can you give me the cool breeze? I've been waiting all my life for that.
Shri Mataji: Yes, I think you pass
Interviewer: Yes, right?
Shri Mataji: You were little upset in the beginning when I ,
Interviewer: I was upset this morning.
Shri Mataji: And i's alright
Interviewer: Yes.
Shri Mataji: I think but now you have cool down, and it will work out in no time.
Interviewer: So will I, will I get the cool breeze,
Shri Mataji: Of course.
Interviewer: Or do you have to touch me?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. It might help, talking to me you might get it, but actually you feel it on your fingertips.  As Muhammad Sahib has said that: "At the time of Resurection your hands will speak." And for the first time you feel that All-pervading subtle power, that you become something more than what you are.
That's the saint.

Interviewer: You have healed many people how many would you estimate they've healed in your lifetime?
Shri Mataji: I don't know how many, I've never kept count out.
Interviewer: Hundreds?
Shri Mataji: Yes at least.
Interviewer: At least, at least hundreds.
Shri Mataji: Yes, at least hundreds.
But, actually, the people who become Saints can also.
So if you see Sahaja Yoga, it can be in thousands. Because so many people who became prophets, they have done it.

Interviewer: They are also healing other people.
Shri Mataji: Yes, they are also. They are healing much more than myself nowadays. 

Interviewer: What type of diseases or things have you been able to heal?
Shri Mataji: Most of the incurable diseases get healed, but it's not a faith healing, in the sense you don't have to have faith, or you don't have to believe into any thigns. There's not blindness about it. There's no blindness. Actually, it's a happening, as I told you, like a sprouting of the seed. As a seed sprouts, in the same way, your awakening takes place. And by that you get your parasympathetic nervous system nourished. It's a question of nourishment.
Nourishment, that's how it works out.

Interviewer: You have made a lot of statements about Orthodox religion, specifically Catholicism and Protestantism.
Shri Mataji: Every "ism".
Interviewer: What do you feel about them? What sorts you about that honorship to them?
Shri Mataji: All religions, you see, are nothing but philosophies. They are just philosophies. They are words, words and words.  As Christ Himself - now, let's see he said that: "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." Can you find any Christian without  adulterous eyes, it's rather difficult.
Interviewer: Hum, hum.
Interviewer: Why? Why is it when he said so, why is it we cannot have those innocent eyes? We should have! The reason is what he said that : "He is to be born again within you." And there's, there's a specific place where Christ is awakened when this force rises. 

Interviewer: And here, one of the articles I read said that you felt that some of the Orthodox religions were based on ignorance and extremism. So it sounded to me-
Shri Mataji: Fanatacism.
Interviewer: that you were being negative about them.
Shri Mataji: No, not very negative. I should say, as a mother, that they're mislaid.
Interviewer: Mislead.
Shri Mataji: Mislead. You see, they just started thinking that by reading something or by praying it will work out. You have to be connected first with God.
Interviewer: So how do you get connected?
Shri Mataji: Connected? God has placed everything within you. Everything is within you and it's only the person who is a saint can do it. It's like the Mother Earth: what you do is to put the seed in her and it sprouts it by itself. It's your own.
Interviewer: Hum, hum.
Shri Mataji: So it's spontaneous, it's living.

Interviewer: There is an article from a London newspaper that mentioned that a young boy 17 years old had been very badly injured, almost to the point of being mangled on a motorcycle. And he was - let's say- two miles away from where you were. And yet he claims that he saw you come to him. He thought that you were really, there apparently it was a vision, that you placed your hands on various parts of his body and he was healed. [cut in the video]
The accident saw you there, but yet you were there. How?
Shri Mataji: It's true, it works out.
Interviewer: How can you explain that?
Shri Mataji: You see, we must know that in the realm of God all your telecommunication television, is so efficient, it works.
Just like I'm sitting here, but I'm there and I'm everywhere as then you can see it. In he same way in his "television" they have arrangements like that and you can work it out. It's simple.

Interviewer: One other thing you said is that you are able to cure AIDS. How?
Shri Mataji: Yes, it could be cured because it's a -what I have seen through this Collective Consciousness, that AIDS is caused by the combination of three  subtle centres within us. And if these three centers can be nourished, it can be cured. I - I think one fellow got cured in London.

Interviewer: But you also said in another interview something to the effect that if you, if everyone became Collectively conscious or at one with you or as sane as you want to put it, that there would be no more homosexuality. So are you saying then that homosexuality is a negative thing?
Shri Mataji: No, it is unnatural.
Interviewer: Unnatural?
Shri Mataji: It is not natural. The thing is when they get homosexual, it is because of the forced conditions. For example, say,  you see, if they see the women are too dominating, it's difficult to carry on with them, they are not any more women, there are more men, you see, so they prefer men who are womanish sort of thing, it's a mixture. The society is quite mixed up.
Or also can be possible sometimes a man can be possessed by a woman and she might - he might behave like that. It's a complicated personality.

Interviewer: Jerry Falwell was on her show last week I believe a week before, he said that the natural state that would cure a lot of things is monogamy: one man for one woman. Do you agree?
Shri Mataji: Of course I mean, that's natural to be like that! No problems.
Interviewer: He said that our society, society  has become too promiscuous and that's why that we have all these new diseases.
Shri Mataji: Yes. You see the thing is, we are on an ego oriented society and where we think: "What's wrong?" But we don't see the whole we just see part of it, you see. And ego can never lead us to right things. Our Self is the one that gives us all the security, all the wisdom all the guidance. And then we just become monogamous automatically. I don't have to tell. Most people who became prophets, as I said, got cured they became monogamous. They were, some of them were homosexuals they became normal people they got married.

Interviewer: Okay. We are out of time. I'd love to chat with you more some of your ideas are very, very fascinating. For those of you that would like to go and intend a free lecture, I don't know if we can call  "lecture", but experience with Shri Mataji, there are three meetings that shall be available  to- you'll be able to see her here in Los Angeles. First this Saturday at the First Methodist Church on Franklin Avenue right here in Hollywood. And also then again on Monday and on Tuesday, and that's at 7 o'clock so this Saturday first United Methodist Church of Hollywood.
Thank you very much.
Shri Mataji: Thank you.
