Public program, Mooladhara (English & Hindi). Delhi, India. 12 March 1979.

[Hindi translation] What should I say? Just tell me really I don’t know what to say (mother laughs). I keep on saying everything. Sir you tell me what do you want to know. Yogi: Tell us Do’s and Don’ts. Shree Mataji: Haan Do’s and Don’ts. Actually today here more Sahaj Yogis are sitting who have already attained realisation and those who are not realised are less. So they are asking me to tell what realised people should do. First thing is that Sahaj Yog is not a lecture or a brain wash. It is nothing like these things. It is actualisation which actually happens to you. It has to be actualisation because if your attention is outside and if I say you take your attention inside then you cannot take it. If I say take your attention towards your spirit then you will ask where the spirit is and where I have to take the attention. It is possible only by one means when something happens inside you and due to that actualisation attention will go inside.

[Mother speaks in English] I am telling them about the way Sahaj Yoga is. It is not the talking about it or giving a lecture or a brain wash that is going to help but the actualisation the happening that is going to take place within you. Now why, people ask me, why this kundalini was kept like that there and then it had to rise and that people had to seek it. First of all as I said that Kundalini is the residual consciousness within us is recording all that we have done before in many lives and today whatever we are doing. It is the subconscious which is like a tape recorder, the (unclear text) micro subconscious you can call it, which is placed in the triangular bone. Now why is happening is necessary because the attention that is outside of human beings have to be pulled inside. Now how is it possible to attract the attention inside? Say something happens, say a tree falls down, you are listening to me with complete concentration but a tree falls down you all will pay attention to that, because that’s a happening which attracts your attention. That’s why kundalini rising was necessary. If kundalini was just placed in a way like all our nerves are there would have been no happening. To create the happening within us the kundalini was keep in such a fashion in three hand a half coil. So the happening takes place and automatically our attention is attracted inside. Because we know Sahaj Yoga is a spontaneous happening. It happens spontaneously. You cannot take your attention inside whatever you may try. You think you are deluded in thinking that you are doing something about your evolution.

So we come to the point what should we do after realisation. Before realisation don’t have to do anything what so ever because you cannot do. It is something like this machine has not yet started or your car has not yet started. When the car has not started then how will you move about? What is the use of moving the steering? What’s the use of moving the brake or clutches? It makes no difference. So, doing anything before self realisation has no meaning. Has no meaning. Now don’t pay attention to every small happening anybody coming in and all that. That’s too much. Pay attention. (mother laughs) So before realisation people think we should do some sort of a jap and tap and all these things. This is all artificial. When your machine has not yet started why should you do it? Without knowing your atma or spirit you cannot know anything about god and whatever you try to do could be absolutely wrong because you haven’t got the eyes to see. That’s why all these people who play in to the religions have landed in difficulties. Once you are connected with god, you enter into the kingdom of god, then you are looked after and then you have a right to use your powers as a citizen of that kingdom. But before that if you try to do any such efforts it is all futile. Could be like a telephone being used which is not connected to the mains. It is like a toy. It’s a dummy. Till you are realised you are a dummy. You must get your realisation. And for that god has already made arrangements in you. Why are you worried? As I have said again and again you have become a human being from amoeba without doing any effort. Who has done it? A seed sprouts (unclear word) do you stand on your head for a seed or does the seed stand on its head. This is a living process, you whole evolution is a living process, which has to be worked out by god almighty himself. You cannot do it. Once you know that you cannot do it, then you will realise that all the efforts you have put in might have even spoiled your kundalini’s channel. It has gone to such absurd limit of deliberations sometimes I do feel like laughing but mostly I weep. Even like raj yog and all that people talk of. Actually these things happen within yourself to the machinery when it starts moving. You see it would be something like a car when it moves the wheel also move, automatically. You don’t have to move the wheel. But before starting the car if you start moving the wheel will the car move? It is something like that you have done. Artificially you have moved the wheels, you have moved every (unclear text, may be its thing), taken so much labour and if you have to move the wheel, imagine without starting the car, how much effort you have to put in. You are exhausting your energy, you are spoiling the wheel and you do not even budge out an inch. It is as simple as that. But when i say it has to be effortless, people say what about effort (English translation of word purusharth used by mother in speech). Is all egoistical. Effort is in maintaining yourself alright. Like Kabeer has said “Das kabeer jatan se odhi, jaisi ki taisi rakh di ni chadariya”! That you do not do. You will go to a guru, pay him money, run after him and do all kinds of thing for a guru. But you will not improve your moral life. You will drink, you will have woman, you will have all kinds of self destroying elements working and here you will be going to guru. You must have your dharms intact. This is the effort (purusharth) is to keep yourself away from all kinds of non sensical temptations which come to you and use your freedom to maintain your freedom from this kind of non sensical enslavement. This is all enslavement. This is not freedom. To enjoy your lust and greed is not freedom. The freedom lies in achieving the power to be above all these things, above all temptations. Every moment we are enslaving ourselves. There we do not put in any efforts. On the contrary we make all efforts to see that we are completely destroyed before we come to Sahak Yoga. So now here mataji is sitting and breaking her hands and making her feet.

Children get realisation in no time. They enjoy the vibrations without any difficulty. They have no problems. They are so quiet. They are enjoying the atmosphere. Why you have complicated yourself for nothing at all. We read all kinds of non sensical things. By reading do you think you will reach god? What university did Christ attend? How many books did he read? What university any one of the saints who were regarded as a real saints have attended? Gyaneshwara the great person from the south, Adishankaracharya from Kerala, anyone of them, did they attend any university? They never required it. Because knowledge is within. Whatever is without is non knowledge (avidhya). Even Surdas say after writing Sursagar “Surdas ki sabhi avidhya dur karo nandlal”. What is the knowledge (vidhya)? What is the knowledge (vidhya) of a motor car? To know what switch wrks what instrument, to know how to control the car, to know how to drive it, that is the knowledge (vidhya) of car. In the same way the knowledge (vidhya) is to know what is the key for different chakras, how to keep your own chakras alright, how to keep the chakras of others alright. How by these things you get the movement in your own (unclear text: may be it is being.)

What’s the matter? I don’t think I (unclear text). It’s quite a lot. There is no need at all for you to know the key before starting the car. After starting the car you can see for yourself. If this works, you can put on the switch, does the light comes in? If you are not able to start the car What’s the use of knowing the keys also? But surprisingly nobody knows the keys. They are so silly if I tell you, you will be amazed to know how the work it out. Now you get a car which is stranded. It’s not moving at all. You are a novice person, you have never seen a car. Alright, so the car comes to you. So they say alright you take one name Rama’s name. You don’t know where does this deity lie. Whether you have to put on that one or not? Whether you have to use that name or not? Whether you are endowed with the right to use that name or not? You say alright i will take the name. So you start taking out the hood of the car. It is that foolish. It is that absurd. It is that stupid. Knowledge (vidhya) Is to know all the keys of your being, to know about yourself, and about others and to know how to work out these keys. Of this mechanism, the tantra of kundalini. But these horrible tantrikas, they call themselves tantrikas, they are cheats(thugs). They are not tantrikas, they do not know the tantra. They know just opposite of tantra, how to insult the tantra by leading a very unholy life. Holiness is the petrol of this tantra. Is the light of this tantra. Without holiness you cannot work out anything about kundalini and those who try their hands get such backfires and such shocks they describe it as kundalini awakening. So useless and so thoroughly dangerous are these theories of tantrikas. Throw all these theories in the sea. Sea is the only thing can take engulf this poison. You are selling tantrism, you are selling poison, you are making money on selling poison. Befalling your motherland, defaming your own mother kundalini. So realise that it is the work of god. It is the ocean which is going to engulf the little drop and not the drop that is going to fall in to the ocean. It is effortless. Sahaja. Sahaja means effortless but the word has come from Sah and Ja. Sah means with germ is born, is born with you. even using this name, I have seen, I have seen people using this name Sahaja have used all asahaja methods. Give them chairs if they want to sit. Come in the evening. Now what the sahaja yogi should do and what they should not do. I am still not very sure. I am not very just now I should tell about it because there are many who are not yet sahaj yogis here. So best thing is to give them realisation first and then we will discuss this with the sahaj yogis alright.
