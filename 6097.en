Guided meditation in the Palace (note of a yogi). Cabella Ligure (Italy), 21-22 September 1991.

Shri Mataji started by using the left hand with the right hand open on the lap, saying that it’s like giving yourself balance, if you are catching on the left, you work with the right.

She started at the Vishuddhi, which begins just above the Agyna, using the Vishuddhi finger and pressing it slowly upwards to the point where the hairline begins, then slowly bringing it back down a little, and moving it a little way across the forehead and back, like a cross:

‘If you are catching here at Vishuddhi, it means you are uncollective.’

The Agyna was catching. She asked us to say silently, ‘Matreya, You are Matreya’. (which is on the left side of the Ekadesha Rudra, which itself if just below the Vishuddhi and between the Agyna and the Vishuddhi on the forehead,) Also, to press the Agyna chakra a little.

‘Working back and up from the Vishuddhi is the Right Nabhi, then the Sahasrara with the Left and Right Heart on either side of it, but reversed, the left on the right side and the Right on the left.’ Then work on the left nabhi: ‘You can feel when it’s caught, it’s hard heavy stuff.’

Further back, at each side of the Back Agyna, which here Shri Mataji referred to as the Mooladhara, are the Left and right Swadisthans, also reversed.

Shri Mataji worked for two or three minutes, then came to the Ego on the upper left side of the forehead and the ‘Conditionings’ on the upper right side, extending back to the ears. We also rubbed each of these chakra positions in turn.

For the Ego we can say the mantras to Shri Buddha or to Shri Matreya.

‘Now close our eyes and put your attention on Sahasrara. When thoughts are coming – they will – you can take the Bija Mantra “Ksham, Ksham’. You can also say silently the Nirvichara Samadhi mantra. Now leave your problems to the Divine Power.’

Shri Mataji then closed Her eyes and went into meditation. Then said, “for Me it is easy, I have no problems!’

Laughing and smiling, She spoke about this word ‘problem’ which they learnt in Geometry: ‘Just don’t put your attention to the problems. Then you will end up in the Turya state. Turya means fourth. You’ll jump into the Fourth Dimension. For instance, when you see these mountains and the nature, you are just there, and you just jump into it. It’s practice for the attention so that when you get a crisis, you’ll just automatically go there, and it will work out. You were destined to come to this point, think how few you are compared to the world population. So now you leave it to the Divine. It’s like the landing of an aeroplane, it’s all fixed, it just comes without any effort.’

Shri Mataji then said, “Because I have given you Realization, the most powerful mantra is ‘Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, namoh nam’ha.’ When you first sit (for meditation), you might feel catches or heat. It’s not necessarily you; it might be the people around you, or the atmosphere, not to worry about it. But when you sit down individually (on your own) before the photograph, you will see how you are.

What I have seen is the giving of a bandhan. First, actually first, one should tie up the kundalini and then give a bandhan.’

Shri Mataji said that the attention should be on the left hand, which we should look into the left hand when tying up the Kundalini. When She tied it, She revolved only the right hand. On the third knot, the right hand only is pulled away.
Ardha Kavacha
(Half protection)

Giving a bandhan, Shri Mataji demonstrated the bandhan for routine protection and made three distinct movements of the right hand up and over from left side to right, without the return movement. (Similar to raising the left and lowering the right.) She said that each movement counted as half. So, seven movements (without the return) are a half-protection, which also, She said, add up to 3 ½.

Poorna Kavacha

(Full Protection)

This is our normal, full bandhan, which Shri Mataji described as being for when one is facing a dangerous person or crisis. At the end of the meditation, She again mentioned the Turya state when you just jump into thoughtless awareness automatically, and lastly,  ‘You shouldn’t talk very much. You lose energy. I’ve seen that. If you want to talk, talk about Sahaja Yoga, not about the bad of others, but the good that others have done.’

22nd September 1991 

Shri Mataji began by saying: “Do not allow anyone to dominate you. You are all individuals. If you do allow it, you will go into the left, where you suppress (emotions) and can become very possessed. You’ll go into the collective subconscious, where you could even develop cancer. When someone tries to dominate you. You must just laugh, treat it as a joke. Especially, you must not be dominated by your wives…. Nor wives by their husbands.’

Shri Mataji then told the story of Shiva and Parvati, who went for a walk and met a snake. The snake said, ‘I want to go and meditate.’ So they said, ‘Alright, go under that tree and meditate there.’ When they came back from their walk, they found the snake lying there, badly beaten and bruised with some skin peed off. They asked what had happened? The snake explained that it had been stoned by some boys while meditating. Shiva said. ‘I told you to meditate but I didn’t tell you not to hiss.’

Shri Mataji continued that also men must not dominate their wives, but treat them with wisdom to put them in their places. “Women are more spiritually evolved. Normally they are the emotions, so that they can achieve Bhakti more easily. But if they do not respect their Self-Realization, they will go down…. Whereas for men, Bhakti is the next step.’

Shri Mataji then gave the example of the chariot. Where the man and woman are the wheels: ‘ But left should be on the left and right on the right. You are equal but not similar. One wheel should not be smaller, or the chariot goes round and round in circles. In marriage, you are each other’s companion..…Now let's have a meditation on Bhakti.’

Shri Mataji placed Her right hand on Her heart and the men did the same:

‘First you must sit down with the photograph and put me in your heart. Also, mentally you must see everything that Sahaja Yoga has done for you in your life and what my incarnation means to you and the whole world.’

She continued that ‘once we were in Bhakti, we don’t feel any suffering, it all becomes a play. When we are in Bhakti, who can touch us? But, when someone dominates us, our Bhakti gets lost.

Also, if someone praises us, we enjoy it through our ego, like two sides of a rupee, giving happiness and unhappiness. But if you can jump into this Bhakti, one can rise very high without any effort.’

Shri Mataji explained how we should sit comfortably, relaxed, with hands open.

‘For Bhakti, there is no method or technique, there are no rules or regulations for Bhakti…Now raise your hands, in Bhakti. Also, bend your head.’

The hands were raised off the knees a little, up towards Shri Mataji, and heads bent to face the ground.

‘First put your right hand on Sahasrara and rotate it clockwise. (Shri Mataji here went into meditation for some minutes with her hand on Sahasrara). Now, take your right hand down….’If thoughts are coming, you can put your hand back to the Sahasrara.’

Shri Mataji then spoke about people have faith in Christ, or Krishna, or the Madonna, especially if then they were young there was a special adoration for these deities. Because, from childhood they have heard about them, they have not met them.

‘Now all these deities are with me, and they are trying to show you through the photos and the miracles…So, now your children will have this Bhakti for me, automatically. They are lucky to have parents who are Sahaja Yogis.’

Shri Mataji continued by saying that those who were Christians should say in the heart, especially for the left side:

‘You are the Holy Spirit that Christ has sent.’ Those who are not Christian should say that She is the Devi or the Adi Shakti.

(During this time, the vibrations were very strong. Shri Mataji was sitting in deep meditation, in Her Majesty, Her hands resting on Her lap, eyes closed, completely still).

After some time, Shri Mataji played a song on a new cassette by a famous blind Indian singer and film composer Ravindra Jain, accompanied by another well-known singer, Hemalata. Shri Mataji explained that he has now written songs about Her and Sahaja Yoga and has put a lot of heart into his music. The song played was very devotional, after which Shri Mataji said it contained two new names not included in the thousand names of the Devi. She was touched by these names and gave beautiful explanations of their meaning:

‘Yoganirupana’ meaning: ‘Giving the explanation of Yoga – its deep meaning and verification’ Shri Mataji said that never before has the Yoga been explained. None of the incarnations did this. The great Indian saints such as Gyaneshwara, who took his samadhi when he was 23, and Tukaram, also did not explain the Turya, because they could not talk to the people. Sahaja Yogis were not there at this time to understand this subtle subject.

‘But you have realization, You can actually experience and verify it.’

‘Dharma Vikasini’ meaning: ‘The flowering, the blossoming of Dharma – when thieving, lying etc, are gone and righteousness, kindness and honesty start manifesting.)’ Shri Mataji shaped Her hands like the closed bud of a flower, a lotus, then opened them as She explained about the ‘Bud of Dharma’ opening:

‘And the fragrance of this Dharma starts emitting, filling the whole atmosphere…’

Referring again to Bhakti, Shri Mataji mentioned a couplet, in which it says that ‘In your heart is a picture of love. If you bow your head, you can see this picture.’

‘Look at the photo and then put Me in your heart.’ (All heads were bowed to Her.) ‘Actually, you are surrendering your ego…. It’s written in the Bhagavad Gita….You need to practice this meditation, it’s like music, you must practice, today this, tomorrow this.’

Shri Mataji also said that what matters is now how long we meditate but how deep.

She then gave the treatment for runny noses in the morning: to take a basil leaf and a black peppercorn with some ghee.

Shri Mataji then talked about Russia, saying how the Russian people don’t like Lenin now, but they don’t realize what he has done for them, he made them introspect.

About the Russian Sahaja Yogis, She said how devoted and dedicated they are, and how the Nagpur musicians had been overwhelmed by their devotion and love for Shri Mataji. One lady wanted to give them tea and told them that, singing the songs of praise of Shri Mataji, they must be celestial beings. But they said they could not stay, and they had to leave in the bus. But then the bus broke down, and they had to back to her. Shri Mataji added that the musicians felt ashamed when they saw the devotion of the Russian Yogis, and that we should also experience these people.

The meditation ended, Shri Mataji gave her blessing and said: ‘Even if I am not here, you should come and sit for meditation. The vibrations are flowing, wherever I am.’

Om twameva sakshat Shri Dharma Vikasini sakshat, Shri Nirmala Devi namoh nam’ha.
