Talk After Marriages in Kew Ashram. Melbourne (Australia), 16 March 1985.

SRI MATAJI: Beautiful, beautiful, is really. It comes from the heart. The whole tune, everything so beautiful. Beautiful, absolutely. Is all the description, isn't it? I don't know what has happened to Christians now, where have they gone. Singing all these songs, feel so lost with them. It's rather heavy, better take it out here.

DR. WARREN: No, no, I want to show you... 

PETER COX: We wanted to show you Shri Mataji. 

SHRI MATAJI: What?

WARREN: something special.

SHRI MATAJI: Ah ha. How did you get it that way, uh? Beautiful, Oh that's fine really. Very beautiful. Yes, may God bless you. It's beautiful.

WARREN: Ray went to all these little details.

SHRI MATAJI: I tell you, Ray is the limit. I don't know how he managed, really. And these little, little photographs we get, and all such problems there.

RAY: Peter, are you going to do "Awake, Awake"? 

SHRI MATAJI: Hmm?

PETER: We're going to do just the song without the poem. This is the next one, Shri Mataji (handing sheet).

CHOIR SING: "POLORUM REGINA"

SHRI MATAJI: Really, they are based on Indian melodies, something like that. Very much is it. And in our, also in our, ah, villages and all that, specially in the Bengal side they have songs made like this, you see, in the -what you call - in the villages, people sing, you see, with this kind, but this very difficult to sing otherwise, you see, very difficult. Is a little, little movements, is beautiful, beautiful, really. Very beautiful. That you have picked it up is something really great.

PETER: It's through Your Grace, Shri Mataji, we're all learning to sing so well.

SHRI MATAJI: Ha, ha, and such beautiful voices you have. I tell you, you all can be given, ah, world prizes the way you are. I am wondering from where all this good voice is coming. It's tremendous, that's it. You see Christine was from America now, she is in America. She used to sing so horribly bad, see, and suddenly I heard her one day and she was like a cuckoo bird, you know, such a sweet voice. I said: "What have you done?" She said: "Nothing, Mother. It's my Spirit now sings I think." So beautiful, the whole voice, everything has become so sweet. Thank you very much, beautiful, may God bless you.

PETER: We have one more song, Shri Mataji. 

SHRI MATAJI: All right.

PETER: Which is not from Spain, it's from a poem by William Blake.

SHRI MATAJI: All right.

PETER: And we, through various sources of inspiration, have set it to the music of Mozart.

SHRI MATAJI: Oh, that's the greatest of it. They are really, I must say, tremendous people. I think what we need is a big orchestra now. Some people should start learning, playing all these things, you see, to have a big orchestra. To play Mozart. Would be great.

CHOIR SINGS "AWAKE, AWAKE".

SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much. The Mozart was great and made greater by you. Same with William Blake. Imagine how much he was worried about England. That's how I went there. Is, all these things must be played ... All these things should be sent there to England. Really, what a choir.

WARREN: While you're waiting for the choir, Mother (Sydney Choir) Sarah is going to play a cello piece for you.

SHRI MATAJI: (To Kim Napper). You got your dress You got it? You haven't got it? Better show her. Someone has got it. Sharon has got it. Where is Sharon? Shannon? Where is she? She has got it. All right? Is a very big cloth, so you can have a nice long dress, alright? May God bless you, you sit Must all be tired, all holding that. You can take it out, if you want to have it. You are tired, you'd better take it out.

SARAH PLAYS.

SHRI MATAJI: But it improved with realization you think? The concentration?

SARAH: Yes, oh yes.

SHRI MATAJI: Yes. It looks like that very deep, you played very deeply for your age. See a thing is with concentration because Sahaja Yoga gives you that concentration, isn't it.

SARAH: I have another one.

SHRI MATAJI: Yes please. It's beautiful. SARAH PLAYS.

SHRI MATAJI: It's marvelous. Beautiful, beautiful. It's so remarkable, without notation, you see, with concentration, to play and it's a very fast number. How beautifully she's played. Thank you very much. Is very kind.

RAY: Shri Mataji, before the Sydney choir starts, the children are getting very sleepy. Paul just told me they've prepared also one song for you as well.

SHRI MATAJI: All right. That I would like to have and then they can go to sleep. That's fine. All the children. Come along That's the best. Better wear that, you're feeling cold I think. Better wear it, it's very, very cold. Just let her - make way. All right.

CHILDREN SING "SONG TO JOY".

SHRI MATAJI: Who is this (Ron van Skip?) lyrics. 

WARREN: Who is the writer of the lyrics? 

SHRI MATAJI: Ninth.

PAUL HENRYON: I don't know who it is but the music was composed from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
SHRI MATAJI: Beethoven.

PETER COX: Schiller, the poem.

SHRI MATAJI: They have already said all this thing, isn't it?

WARREN: They're his words, we didn't amend them at all.

SHRI MATAJI: And you too have chosen such a nice thing. Oh, wonderful, beautiful. So now you are going to kiss me goodnight and go to sleep, all right? Come along. Now you have to kiss me, no - goodnight, all right? Good children. Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, all right? Goodnight, all right. Goodnight, goodnight, how beautiful, all right. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, goodnight, all right, goodnight, goodnight. Goodnight all of you, goodnight. You have all kissed Me?
