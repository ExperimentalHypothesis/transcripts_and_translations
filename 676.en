b'The Importance of Dedication and Devotion, Nirmala Palace - Nightingale Lane Ashram, London (United Kingdom), 6 August 1982.\nThe other day I talked to you about the importance of dedication in Sahaja Yoga and the devotion that one should have. Actually, when we are close to the mountain, we can\xe2\x80\x99t see much of it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we don\xe2\x80\x99t realize the volume that is so close to us, the greatness that is facing us.\n\nThis is one of the illusions that works out for people who do not realize it mentally - what they are in for, where are they, what have they found, what is Self-realization, what is its magnitude, how far they have to go, why are they chosen, what is their purpose of life, how far they have come up, how far they can understand. All these things are beyond the grasp, and one gets stunned, one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what has happened to him when he got Realization actually. That\xe2\x80\x99s why to understand this is only possible if you can understand how to dedicate, how to devote yourself.\n\nIf you want to analyze anything on the basis of your rationality, you are too stunned. It\xe2\x80\x99s too beyond you. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. It is too much. It\xe2\x80\x99s really beyond you. Now think of it - you have got Realization. Can you believe it? That you can, in your life time\xe2\x80\xa6 if somebody had told you this, you would never have believed it - that how can you get your Realization in this earth? Of course you were seeking - because people were saying we have to seek, also you felt you have to seek - but you never thought that this will materialize like this, that you will get your Realization. Then, after getting Realization, you could not feel what it was. Just if you have dropped into the ocean, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is the dimension of this ocean. How far you have gone into it? What is it? Where are we? What is our purpose? To add up to all the mess, we become thoughtless. So you cannot even find out as to, rationally, what it is.\n\nSo, the immensity of this experience, the glory of your Mother\xe2\x80\x99s coming, or the precious gift of your Self-realization - nothing can be realized through your understanding. Try to think - what have you got? Can you measure it with your understanding? Can you understand what has happened? No, you cannot. Because rationality cannot give you the dimensions into which you have fallen. The rationality is actually broken out. There is no rationality left now anymore to even communicate as to what you have been seeking and where have you landed. So the only method you have got now - or only way is left to you - for a drop which has become an ocean, is to dissolve more in the ocean, so that you feel the ocean at least. And to communicate with other drops in such a way that you know the whole through all of them.\n\nSo first is a complete devotion. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important. In this incarnation only it is so very important - because you have got Realization. If you did not have Realization - all right. Murmuring souls - all right. Half-baked people - all right. Little bit misbehaving - all right. This can be forgiven, that can be forgiven\xe2\x80\xa6 everything is forgiven. To look at it, everybody thinks that \xe2\x80\x9cMother is forgiving us.\xe2\x80\x9d But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. I am forgiving because of My own nature. But you do not take it for granted. You are harming yourself by accepting that forgiveness. If you all the time think, \xe2\x80\x9cO Mother, You are so forgiving, please forgive me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6 you are already forgiven, as it is. Once you call Me \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x9d, you\xe2\x80\x99re forgiven. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the advantage? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any advantage out of it. You are a loser. And this point at least rationally if you understand, then you will understand what is a devotion. So, in devotion of Sahaja Yoga, one has to realize that the things that are in Sahaja Yoga, that you have seen in Sahaja Yoga, are beyond your mind - first thing. Definitely, they are beyond human conception. So, on human level, you do not discuss them, and you do not talk about them. But on the collective level you can talk. And when you come to the collective level, then you have to understand that relationship with Me is more established, better established if you establish your relationships with others, in a very collective and homogeneous way. As I told you, the drop becomes the ocean; and the drop has to become the ocean by dissolving all its \xe2\x80\x9cdropness\xe2\x80\x9d with other drops. And all the drops dropping their dropness become the ocean ultimately. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that devotion is double-wedged: one is to each other, and one is to your Mother.\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga, whatever I see, you cannot see. This is proved or not - to you people? Or do you want more proofs? Now it is proved that \xe2\x80\x9cMother sees much beyond us, and whatever She sees happens.\xe2\x80\x9d So anybody who tries to play tricks with Mother is actually playing tricks with himself. Any tricks you try to play with Me, or you think that \xe2\x80\x9cMother is very forgiving, so She will forgive us\xe2\x80\x9d - is really you are torturing yourself, you are\xe2\x80\xa6 it is detrimental to you. Many people are there who will say that \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my Left Swadisthana.\xe2\x80\x9d Some will say, \xe2\x80\x9cI was possessed; there was bhoot.\xe2\x80\x9d Somebody will blame something else. Whatever you are blaming - actually, who is asking you the explanation? It\xe2\x80\x99s only you asking yourself. You are not facing yourself. So the devotion to Me means actually facing to yourself. You face yourself first of all, and see for yourself what are you doing. You are your own enemy; nobody is your enemy. Your Mother is not, definitely. She\xe2\x80\x99s not your enemy by any chance. And no bhoots are your enemies - in the way, if you do not allow them, they can\xe2\x80\x99t be there. No evil person is your enemy, because he cannot be effective if you are spiritually equipped. So you are your own enemy, is decided now.\n\nThe only way to get rid of that enemy of yours - you have to dedicate. Supposing you say that \xe2\x80\x9cI have faith in Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin God.\xe2\x80\x9d So you are holding on to something, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And you are discarding something. But this hold has to be very strong. Rationally, if you at that time when you are sinking, will you rationalize, \xe2\x80\x9cWhether I should hold the hand of this person who is saving, is correct or not?\xe2\x80\x9d No, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just\xe2\x80\xa6 your grip will be very strong. It will be extremely strong, and you will grip it with full force, with full faith - that \xe2\x80\x9cSome or other, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d And that kind of a feeling should be within us that \xe2\x80\x9cI am a person who is sinking because of myself. And if I am to be saved, I have to be absolutely, completely submerged in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely I have to become one with it, then only I can be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d Because at this level, where you are realized souls of a higher level\xe2\x80\xa6 now for a next jump, as I was saying to you - is devotion. Anything else has to be secondary, under the circumstances. If it is primary and your attention is still on that, then you cannot have this second jump.\n\nFirst jump you have already done, you have got your Realization. But from first jump to second jump - you\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard, you have come to the second jump - in the second jump, you have to face it up. You should not feel disgusted with yourself nor dejected with yourself for nothing. But treat yourself as a separate entity. And dedication is, actually, turning back to yourself and looking forward towards the divine personality in you. Once there is divine personality in you, there\xe2\x80\x99s no problem of devotion. You\xe2\x80\x99ll just become one with it; you\xe2\x80\x99ll start enjoying it. But this rationality is the worst thing, that plays tricks with you, which deviates you from understanding that whatever life you have led so far has been on a very material, gross life. You came out of it, you have grown out of it, you have come up. Now, to blossom, to become fragrant, you have to give up rationality. That\xe2\x80\x99s a binding [POINT?]. Try to avoid rationality, try to avoid arguments, try to avoid giving reasons and\xe2\x80\xa6 Even now I find sometimes Sahaja Yogis give an explanation of psychology: \xe2\x80\x9cShe might be insecured, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d This is typically somewhere read in the book: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of insecurity, somebody does that.\xe2\x80\x9d Actually, now we have seen in Sahaja Yoga that most of the so-called insecured are the most aggressive people. They play tricks with others, spoil their lives - and enjoy it. They are the greatest sadists ever born. We have seen these people. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is inse\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d - and that\xe2\x80\x99s how they play tricks with themselves. Now, once you understand that you are not to play tricks with yourself\xe2\x80\xa6 why do you want to play tricks with yourself? You have to be yourself, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. We should not be our own enemies. Are we? So, once you start facing yourself, you will like yourself. You won\xe2\x80\x99t feel disgusted. Because that what \xe2\x80\x9cyourself\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about is glorious, is beautiful, is without any kalanka [blemish] on that, is absolutely detached. But, first of all, your attention has to accept it - that \xe2\x80\x9cThis detachment is my life; I\xe2\x80\x99m a different personality now. Detachment is my nourishment.\xe2\x80\x9d Detach yourself. One gentleman came to see Me in My house. I had a very beautiful lamp, and he liked it. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have it.\xe2\x80\x9d He was so amazed, you see. Wife telephoned to Me: \xe2\x80\x9cHow could it be? How could You give away such a nice thing?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s there? Am I going to carry it with Me when I die? Is it going to go with Me? Just see rationally. If he has liked it, better have it. I have so many lamps in the house; if he takes one, what does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d She said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, You see, I asked my husband, \xe2\x80\x98Will you give this lamp - like this if you had - to Her?\xe2\x80\x99 He said, \xe2\x80\x98No, I would not.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m really\xe2\x80\xa6 I would not\xe2\x80\x99, he said.\xe2\x80\x9d He was very honest. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not.\xe2\x80\x9d But still, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why not?\n\nSo, you know, till the last end we are holding on to something very little there. This\xe2\x80\xa6 even a little bit is holding the sari. You know that, that can hold the whole sari. Even a little bit is attaching to this sari - the sari can be held back. The whole thing you can hold it with one little pin. All these small pins that are there - the hangs-up - are to be denied, to be seen\xe2\x80\xa6 going further. Look at yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Ego? All right, now recede; let me see how do you go back.\xe2\x80\x9d To see all those things\xe2\x80\xa6 you see, as a play, you should see yourself. And then play tricks with your ego and superego. Actually, they\xe2\x80\x99re playing tricks with you. Once you are a master, you play tricks with them.\n\nSo many times I have seen: I\xe2\x80\x99ve said so many things, and they are again\xe2\x80\xa6 then, after some time, people start talking about it. Within one or two months after that, it comes as a scientific proof or things like that. You have seen that, many a times it has happened. Now, when I say something, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure about it, what I say. I never say anything but the truth. I know that I am saying only the truth. But I do not go inside and find out whether it is the truth or not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t read a book to find out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you. I have faith in Myself, full faith in Myself. Whatever I say is the truth; I know for definite that I\xe2\x80\xa6 whatever I say comes out truth. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not your case. That\xe2\x80\x99s not your case, that whatever you say is the truth. So first you have to establish this state - that \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever I say will be the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, how do you do it? The tongue should be such that whatever you say should be the truth. Ultimately, it will come out as truth. And that is why the dedication should be there. What dedication? \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I tell lies?\xe2\x80\x9d There is no need to tell lies. Even if I tell lies, it will come truth - in My case. So-called lies. They are never lies. If I say to somebody, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a bad man\xe2\x80\x9d - apparently to you: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mother, he is such a fine man! How can You say such a thing about him?\xe2\x80\x9d We had one Mr. Michael like that. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is such a loving person, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Somebody said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, are you jealous of him?\xe2\x80\x9d Up to that extent, you know. But when he showed his real teeth, you see, then people knew. So, to develop that kind of understanding about the truth, first of all, you should absolutely fix yourself on the truth. And the truth is that you are the instrument of God, that you have got Realization, that you have got a special awareness, which people do not have. Stand on that. And proclaim it. You are not to be afraid of it. You have got Realization, no doubt. You have felt it. Say it: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Realization. Nothing doing, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m a realized soul.\xe2\x80\x9d Firm on that.\n\nIn this expression of truth, you have to be like the light. The light asserts. It not only asserts but it shows others also that it shines. It shows others that \xe2\x80\x9cI am the light,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cYou walk in my light, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t try to do it, I may burn you.\xe2\x80\x9d So they have that\xe2\x80\xa6 what you call, that\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the word is\xe2\x80\xa6 Tejasvita. Tejas. Sharpness of light. That tejasvita is there, that sharpness of light. That is the proof of your truth.\n\nYou are not afraid of any prime minister, or any minister, or any king, or anyone. But - \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the fact. That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. I know I am a realized soul, I am the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d If you say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever you will say will be the truth, no doubt about it. Whatever you will do will be the truth. But say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d But for that, a real purification is needed about facing yourself fully, in dedication. Means you are holding on to your Mother, you are holding on to Sahaja Yoga, you are holding on to that truth which you have found out. And here you are facing others.\n\nWithout that you cannot do it; your source is that. You are standing on the truth. And that is such a power, such a strength. All of them if you see - Christ had that power, Mohammed had that power - all these great people had that power to say the truth, with full courage, with that assertion that people will accept it. And they would suffer even for that, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. But whatever is the truth has to be said. That\xe2\x80\x99s the first point one should know about dedication - that you are dedicated fully, that you are not afraid of anyone. You are not worried about your losses. Some people have lost their heads also, completely cut their heads. People have tortured them.\n\nSome people have been\xe2\x80\xa6 taken away all their money, have been tortured in every way, but they thought this was the truth, they stood by it. Some of them were stupid fools; they stood for something that was not truth. They did. But now you know that you are standing on the truth, and for that, you should be willing to sacrifice anything - so-called sacrifice, because you are not sacrificing the truth. What you had tried sacrificing is untruth. For that, you require people of strength and courage, and not these half-baked people. You see, till morning till evening asking for forgiveness from Mother. What is it? What is there to ask for forgiveness - because I am forgiving you every moment. But what are you doing to yourself?\n\nWhat sort of a person you are? You think about it, that you have to stand on the truth. For that, you have to be a strong, courageous person with that sharpness, that tejasvita within you - of the light of the beacon. But at the same time, you have to have complete dedication. Supposing there is no oil in this - it will all go off. It has to have oil. It will go off. So the dedication part is the oil in you, is the attachment, complete attachment to your source. That\xe2\x80\x99s the dedication. But that dedication should not give you any other ideas but of a light which shines, which corrects others, guides the path of other people.\n\nIf that is not so, then the source that you are tapping is not coming to you fully, and that your light is not burning properly. So, into dedication when you go, you must not think that it is any surrendering - the so-called surrendering, that you become like a cabbage. That\xe2\x80\x99s the idea people have - that you become like cabbage. But you become dynamic. You become real power - not of destruction but of construction. I mean, for destruction you don\xe2\x80\x99t need much power. Only for construction you need power. For destruction how much do you need? Very little. You can destroy the whole thing in no time.\n\nBut for the construction you really require great power. And that power - sustained power, or flowing power - has to be there. For that, dedication is needed. Holding on to your source of power, you have to stand firm, courageously, without any fear. That\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. That\xe2\x80\x99s the truth you have to achieve. That\xe2\x80\x99s very important. But this is only one side of the story. That\xe2\x80\x99s not sufficient. Just being the truth, the aspect of one side is there.\n\nBut the other side of it is that when this source comes to you, you become the compassion. The truth and the compassion are one thing. You won\xe2\x80\x99t believe, but it is so. Like the wick and the oil combine to form the light. It is the burning of the oil gives you the light. In the same way, the compassion gives you the truth. There\xe2\x80\x99s no difference whatsoever. Only the state is different - that you cannot see the light, which is oil, and oil, which is burning. So compassion is the one which is the source, as well as your store. So, from the source of compassion, you get your compassion.\n\nYou see, I have seen people - they want to have compassion from Me, they want that I should love them. But - reflect it back - do they love others like that? I have known people, they have\xe2\x80\xa6 say, for one person says harsh thing to another, and comes and asks Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, forgive me for that,\xe2\x80\x9d or does something harsh just for the whim of the mind. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d But when you ask for that, I would like to know: have you given compassion to another person? Even after getting forgiveness from Me - that Source of forgiveness, that Source of compassion - have you given compassion to others? Have you been compassionate to others? You see, it should not be one-sided. If you are taking the advantage of My compassion, it should not be one-sided, that you use it for your own benefit and forget about it. Then you will never grow.\n\nYou will never grow. If you have to grow, then you must store that compassion within you. Whatever compassion I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you, love I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you, you must store that within you - and give that back to others. Otherwise you will be finished, you will be nowhere. Is the growth which is sustained only\xe2\x80\xa6 not only by sucking from one side but by giving to others. Otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99ll be stagnated. There has to be outflow. But that is a very hard thing because people are very good at taking compassion from Mother. Or even if they are compassionate, they will be mostly compassionate to people who are, say\xe2\x80\xa6 in, say, Vietnam - not in the ashram.\n\nThey are more worried about Vietnam people, you know: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mother, we are worried about Vietnam people, we are collecting money for them, we are trying to send money to Vietnam.\xe2\x80\x9d And here among ashramites - fighting. This is not compassion by any chance. Sahaja Yogis among themselves are a different race, and they are to support each other all the time, and look after them. When I find Sahaja Yogis criticizing Sahaja Yogis, I\xe2\x80\x99m amazed. I\xe2\x80\x99m really amazed. Because you are part and parcel of the same. How can you criticize? One eye criticizing another person - I just can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I can criticize, all right, but why should you? Why should you criticize each other?\n\nOnly thing that you have to do is to love each other. Christ has said it thrice, I must have said it a hundred and eight times already - that you have to love each other. That is the only way you are expressing compassion. If I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you any love any time, you have to have patience with others, love for others. I sometimes try to coax people, and I find that people immediately come out with some sort of a criticism of others, or something like that. Now, the basic thing is that our compassion, if that is flowing, then only we can get compassion from Mother. There is no place any more; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done too much compassion business. And what I find that now unless and until you flow it, how am I to give you compassion? I mean, there is no space left now. So better give it away, empty yourself a little bit, then I can give you more compassion. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple business. In this respect, one has to understand that the source cannot flow unless and until it expands the flow of it.\n\nLike the river Thames. We went to see the river Thames, the place from where it starts. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small, little stream from seven streams - little little, very little little - we can say, trickling down. And it has become a river Thames. Supposing it does not widens - that will stop at the beginning only. It cannot come out, it cannot flow. It\xe2\x80\x99s not because it is angry, or upset, or anything like that, but by the nature of its flow only it cannot flow, what to do? So, that is what it is - that one has to give compassion to others. It should not be formal compassion, or affected one, but should be a natural one, very natural, spontaneous, feeling from within. It\xe2\x80\x99s not an expression of your ego, or superego, or over-sentimentality, but is a kind of a understanding that he is a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are brothers. Not the way the brothers have been but a different type of brothers who are spiritual brothers.\n\nYou are spiritual people. So this compassion has to be there, and unless and until you develop that compassionate, fatherly or motherly feelings for others\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean, I am a Mother of a person who is about hundred and eight years of age. You have to really mother others, and have that feeling of compassion and love for others. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about your own comfort, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about your own advantages, but you have to think about the comfort of others. You have to think what you can do to make others comfortable, than to see what will make you comfortable. So this flow of compassion, when it starts, you see, the dedication is complete. Because \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever we got from You, Mother, we are giving it to others.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s the dedication. So the flow of dedication is not one-sided. It is double-sided.\n\nYou stick on to something, you get connected with something to get something out of it, and you give it to others. And ultimately that reaches the collective being - means it reaches the source. It is in this light we have to understand. Exclusiveness, or \xe2\x80\x9cWe should - now married - we should have separate place, we should live separately\xe2\x80\x9d - it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, you must have little privacy as a married people, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that. But as far as compassion is concerned, as married people you have to be much more compassionate. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll only worry about your own children, about your own comfort, about your own husband, about your own wife. In Sahaja Yoga, there is no place for such people. It\xe2\x80\x99s all collective. When you bring sweets for your own child, bring for other children in the ashram. You are one family, and all the family has to move with the same waves.\n\nI had told you before that we cannot have separate food arrangements, separate this and separate that. In the same way, we cannot have separate standards of living for different people. We all have to enjoy whatever is enjoyed by all of you. That should be so. And that should be achieved on material level. On emotional level, any marriage which is absurd, which makes everyone unhappy is useless. But marriages are made to make everyone happy. So, before you decide to marry, think that you are not playing tricks. Playing tricks in Sahaja Yoga is very, very dangerous. You are not playing tricks with your marriages; you are not trying to involve somebody else, thinking that Mother will forgive you and all that.\n\nI will forgive. But your ascent is difficult. So don\xe2\x80\x99t try to play tricks with anything that you have been doing before, but change yourself completely, transform yourself completely. Now you change your attitude towards life. You can because it is changed already. If you try to be the other person, you cannot be. Now you have become a flower, now you can\xe2\x80\x99t become suddenly the leaf. Now you are a flower, and you have to live like a flower. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have to remember - that compassion is such an outflow, is such a natural thing for a Sahaja Yogi. It\xe2\x80\x99s not natural for anybody else.\n\nOther people who talk of compassion, or this and that, are actually, are not at all compassionate. They are doing it for money; they are doing it for position; they are doing for ego satisfaction. But you are having compassion because you have to have it, jolly well. It is flowing, the compassion - because it has to flow. And you are doing compassion because of compassion. There is no other purpose behind it. Only this will give you something that is of permanent nature, of a sthayi nature. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people - as I was telling in the morning - who have gone to an organization, made a beautiful organization out of it, and once they leave, the organization is finished. Because they do not give anything substantial to that organization. And what is to be given is a large heart of compassion. If you do not give that, once you go away from that, the rest of them are again barren. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a growth. Like if you bring water, and plant things, and give water to that area, then it becomes very beautiful, and you can say it\xe2\x80\x99s a very lush growth. But as soon as that water source is removed, it gets again dried out. But Sahaja Yoga is different. In Sahaja Yoga you not only grow as a plant but also as the source of the plant. If this plant is removed from here, put somewhere, it will give water to other plants. Do you know this new dimension that you have within yourself? That once this plant is uprooted from here and taken out, it will not die, not at all. It will grow. But it will make others grow. This is another type of a growth that we have.\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s a very different position we are in. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what now I want - that all of you, even if you are uprooted and put into any other place\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, when I ask people that \xe2\x80\x9cYou better shift from here to there,\xe2\x80\x9d they just get frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cYou better go there and do this\xe2\x80\x9d - they get frightened. You are a plant which can not only go and prosper in any place but you will give the necessary nourishment to other plants. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you are. So do not stick on to one place. If you stick on, then think there must be something wrong with the place. Like a glue if you are sticking to one place, it\xe2\x80\x99s very dangerous. And be sure that you must turn away from such a place which glues you.\n\nThat does not mean that, as people are here, they never stay in the house, they all the time running out. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean. Again I have to strike that point. Because otherwise the people are here\xe2\x80\xa6 are all the time running away from their houses. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. The point is that you should not be glued to anything and not afraid of leaving any place, because now you are Sahaja Yogis. You have joined the ocean, and ocean can take you anywhere. So just prepare yourself to move into any place because you have to take this compassion everywhere. And to prosper the Kingdom of God, you have to serve Him. And this service only possible if you know that you are here for a very great, universal task.\n\nNot only for England, for India, or for America, but you are here for a global task, which is the epitome of our evolution. This is the highest thing we have to do for our Creation and for our Creator, and you are chosen for that. So don\xe2\x80\x99t divert your attention to anything that is not fulfilling your own manifestation. Discard all that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your energy. And your manifestation is your compassion, your love. But still, it should not remain rational. Whatever I have said to you is just to put you into a condition where you start sucking the vibrations as well as giving the vibrations. It is an action, which is a happening that should take place within you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not rationality, it\xe2\x80\x99s not thinking about it.\n\nOnly by saying these things I really stun your thinking. You should allow this to happen to you. Just with the vibratory awareness you should judge yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cAm I the one who is giving vibrations to others? Am I the one who has stored these vibrations, or am I getting ruined?\xe2\x80\x9d All this will give you a great meaning - and an employment. As I said, \xe2\x80\x9cemployed by God.\xe2\x80\x9d If you have any questions, ask Me.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, if you become angry at any point with people, is that because it\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency or a negative entity? Or is it just a tendency to react like that?\n\nShri Mataji: You see, if you get angry within yourself, and if you are sure that you are not doing anything wrong, for a Sahaja Yogi there is no need to say outside you are angry. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need. That anger itself is a power.\n\nAnd you should do your bandhan and anything that you want to do. But you should not show that you are angry. You should be absolutely silent. Because you can be; you are in the axis, you are not on the periphery. Actually, the anger is just to see your anger and use that anger for that purpose. And once you start doing that, that anger will itself work out. That anger will itself work out the person. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed how it\xe2\x80\xa6 but you must learn to see your anger that is working. All these things are important. You have seen that sometimes only shouting at the bhoots - they go away. And many mad people have been cured like that.\n\nBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t do all that, that\xe2\x80\x99s for Me. You must be always decent, with decorum and all that. But if the anger is because of your nature, or a tendency, or out of control - than it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing. If it is an out-of-control, than it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing. If you get into a temper because it is out of control, than it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing. I can get very angry, but I am completely under control: I know I am angry, where the bhoot is, how he is running away; I can see it. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t see the bhoot, you can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything. So there is no need for you to get angry, show temper. But if you have an anger - say, for example, which makes you uncontrollable - then there is a mantra for that: Shanti [peace]. \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.\xe2\x80\x9d You must ask for that bliss, for that peace. This is a mantra for you. For controlling your temper, you have to tell yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.\xe2\x80\x9d So Shanti is the point - the axis point is that - from where you witness everything. You are in Shanti, you are in complete\xe2\x80\xa6 you are not in a turmoil even if you are angry. You are not in a turmoil. Whatever is anger is the power, and the power is taking charge. But unless and until that is achieved, what you have to do is to put yourself in a position that you are peaceful.\n\nSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very good mantra - is to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYa Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.\xe2\x80\x9d Can you say that? So the Shanti is your fort. But peacefulness never means cowardice. Never call cowardice as peace. A person who is peaceful is never coward, because nothing can transgress it, nothing can overpower it. It is never never possible that cowardice and peace can go together. But your power is inside, not outside. So you don\xe2\x80\x99t show your power of your anger outside. But just little anger with anybody - you will see it will work out.\n\nBut first establish that\xe2\x80\xa6 that position within you where you are the axis, where you do not allow anger to sit on your head. That is the growth. That is the growth, that you are at peace. Also\xe2\x80\xa6 Another question? All right, satisfied now? Both ways you should know: that one is the anger that is detached - is perfectly all right; anger which involves you - work it out. So judge yourself as to what it is. Good question.\nAsk some questions.\nI mean, such intellectuals sitting here. Ask Me some questions what is there.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, what are Your plans to spread Sahaja Yoga in outer scale?\nShri Mataji: What are My plans? I don\xe2\x80\x99t plan. You see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t plan, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how far My instruments are ready, you see. First, now My only plans - if I have any - is to really prepare My weapons all right. Once they are done, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll fix them up. You see, unless and until you know how far your bomb can fall, how can you plan it? So, first of all, I must measure up the power of My children, how powerful they are. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do now - is to make them aware of their powers to use.\nLike, you see, Hanumana, when He was born and when He grew up, He forgot that time, and He forgot His powers. So He was to be reminded that \xe2\x80\x9cYou are such and such powerful person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your powers are, you\xe2\x80\xa6 you ate of the whole of Surya. This you did in your childhood. You are born with this power, but now, after growing, you are\xe2\x80\xa6 rather bit\xe2\x80\xa6 sort of forgotten it, and also you were afraid of using them, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 sort of looks like in the dominant position. But it is there. If you just try to remember them, it will come up.\xe2\x80\x9d They have tremendous power, these people have tremendous power. But they have to assume and stand on that.\n\nIf they do not do it\xe2\x80\xa6 You see, if I tell them, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, go to this house\xe2\x80\x9d - \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mother, there may be a bhoot there sitting.\xe2\x80\x9d A person comes possessed in the ashram - they all shut their doors: \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, this bhoot has come.\xe2\x80\x9d Or something - then worse.\n\nDjamel: Mother, may I ask you something? How can we deal with, You see, there is one problem, one big problem in Sahaja Yoga, You know. It\xe2\x80\x99s those who are devoted to You at the expense of others.\nShri Mataji: Those who are devoted to Me?\nDjamel: All those who use the excuse of their devoting to You, Mother, sometimes to oppress others.\nShri Mataji: They are what?\nDjamel: Sometimes people use their devotion to You as, at the expense of others or-\nShri Mataji: Then again the same thing, Djamel. It\'s the same thing is. You see it is: you have to do it. All those who are doing that way, I am just pointing out to all those.\nIt you are using, say, your devotion to Me for the oppressing of others, all right? So it is for you to see.\n\nThere is nobody who can be oppressed, because your Spirit cannot be oppressed. Say, there is X and Y. Now, Y is a person who\xe2\x80\x99s trying to oppress X, all right? What will you oppress? He can\xe2\x80\x99t oppress his Spirit, can he? First point. Clear. Now, this fellow, if he has to have attachment to Me, nobody can stop him.\nThere is all\xe2\x80\xa6 you all have direct relationship with Me. Not through anyone. If you want to accept somebody\xe2\x80\x99s agency, then I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you. But, otherwise, you all have a direct access to Me. You all can grow your Spirits; nobody can dominate you. Everyone has complete freedom to grow their Spirit - to know their Spirit, I mean to say. And the Spirit is something\xe2\x80\xa6 cannot be dominated by anyone. Now, supposing somebody tries to oppress you. What will they oppress you, in which way? They\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll not have this carpet, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have that carpet.\xe2\x80\x9d Have it!\nSomebody will say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll jump in the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d Jump! Just now you jump! What will they oppress you in? You see, just see that. Not in your spiritual growth. Can they? And that\xe2\x80\x99s how the problem starts. You see, in material things\xe2\x80\xa6 say, in an ashram now somebody says, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we would like to have a photograph of Mother put there.\xe2\x80\x9d The other will say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we are going to have it there.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether you put it here or there makes no difference. My photograph is going to work it out. Even in puja matters I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen: people will say that \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother is sitting there, don\xe2\x80\x99t put your feet towards the Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d It is common thing; everybody knows should not put it. But still they will say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we want to put it.\xe2\x80\x9d All right, let them put it. Next time they will not, because they will know it is wrong. They will find out. So, you see, nobody can oppress anyone.\n\nI am here to correct. Once you understand that you are not perfect, the other is not perfect, we are all perfecting ourselves, we are all coming up, Mother is there to look after us - then we will never think like that. Now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen, people will say that there are two Sahaja Yogis talking to others\xe2\x80\xa6 Sahaja Yogis. Now, one is a very oppressive one, the another one is upset to see that this one is oppressive. Now, for that purpose, if you are quiet, silent - you will always dominate him. People will listen to you, not to him. But even if you start saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t say like that,\xe2\x80\x9d this, this, they will think these are fighting cocks. Then, at that time, you are wise at this thing - will even give him a chance to understand. But what happens: one person dominates, another tries to dominate them by outward things. And the whole show is over. There is no need to dominate another person by outward things. He will settle down by himself if you show your dignity of your silence and of your understanding of Sahaja Yoga.\n\nThere is no need just now to say, \xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you sit down, you don\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely wrong. They do it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it. In My presence I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it. Because we still live halfway there and halfway here. The way we solve the problem\xe2\x80\xa6 say, you have to do some business. There are two people doing the business. One person says something, another says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you say like this, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d This person says to that person, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t correct me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLike that the fight is on. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help anyway\xe2\x80\xa6 there also. But in Sahaja Yoga it will never help. The another person can only win over by his dignity. By his quiet methods, by approaching a person properly. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the leaders will come up. They won\xe2\x80\x99t come up by shooting another person down, not at all by any chance. That\xe2\x80\x99s not possible. Is not good leadership. Good leadership is judged the way you handle the situation.\nNot the way you fight another man down. So many times you have seen: I just keep quiet - it works out. Not necessary that you should at that moment shout. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need. And it creates a very bad impression and very bad leadership. First of all, you cannot be dominated. This is one fact, is a truth. You can grow in your spirituality, whatever people may try to dominate in the worldly things. Thank God we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any organization. Thank God we don\xe2\x80\x99t have secretaries, assistant secretaries, under-secretaries, by-secretaries, upper secretaries, lower secretaries - we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any nonsense.\n\nOtherwise, even that would have been dominating to people. Then they would have fought that. So we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that problem. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any money problem, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have all these nonsensical ideas. I\xe2\x80\x99ve solved this problem by having no institutions, no positions. Everybody has position.\n\nBut the greatest position is of your Spirit, which you establish. The attention is not there, is more ego-oriented. The whole stuff is ego-oriented. You can\xe2\x80\x99t fight ego with ego, you cannot. You can only fight ego or superego with Spirit. How much do I dominate you? I absorb all your aggression also. And how much do I dominate you? If I have to correct you, I go forward and do it, and tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99m correcting you, whether you like it or not. And you see the result, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. But if you have that capacity, do it. Then there is lacking in you, that you cannot do that way, so be prepared not to, at least, spoil the show of Sahaja Yoga. One person is talking too much? All right, the others will say, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is good for nothing, but another one is a sensible one.\xe2\x80\x9d But if you both are fighting, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show any wisdom or growth, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Does it? Those who think that by dominating in small small things you are going to achieve anything are wrong. Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, My grandchildren are realized souls. They are not bothered about these things, they don\xe2\x80\x99t do this. This kind of a fight they don\xe2\x80\x99t have. That \xe2\x80\x9cwhere to keep this\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat to do this\xe2\x80\x9d - they don\xe2\x80\x99t have. Nothing. At the most, they might fight for a chocolate or something, at the most. But in spiritual matters, they never fight. In spiritual matters they never fight. That\xe2\x80\x99s a place one should not fight, one should not argue. That\xe2\x80\x99s the point not to be argued, because truth is one. What is there to argue? You have seen all these saints, you see, those who have talked about Me. What do they say? Everybody says the same thing about Me. There cannot be any fight between saints, can there be? If the truth is one, how can there be fight? But because one is inadequate, another is dominating - both must achieve that state.\n\nBut the best is to be more dignified, more grown-up, more patronizing\xe2\x80\xa6 People will definitely take to you because you will become the leader. Arguments are not going to lead you anywhere, I can tell you this much. No use arguing among yourself. If you have to argue, you have to argue with others, not among yourself. Otherwise now? What else? What is the thing?\nAny other question?\n\nSahaja Yogini: Mother, would You please tell a little bit how\xe2\x80\xa6 how we fight our ego with the Spirit? How would you do\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: How do we fight the ego\xe2\x80\xa6\nSahaja Yogini: \xe2\x80\xa6 ego with the Spirit.\nShri Mataji: You see, you should never fight ego. If you try to fight, it will sit more on your head. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way to fight it, that there is ego and you fight your ego: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to box you\xe2\x80\x9d - then it will grow more, you see. The more you box it, the more it will grow. Never fight your ego. Only way is to see it. Your attention is very important, your attention is now enlightened. Whatever you see, it comes to its right size. It comes to its right side\xe2\x80\xa6 size. Say, ego - if it is overgrown, you just watch your ego. That is, it is to watch yourself in the mirror, and you say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Ego, how do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Then it will come down. But don\xe2\x80\x99t fight it. Just to be seen. All kinds of egos could be there. If you are overeducated, you are egoistical. If you are uneducated, you are egoistical - because you must try to show that you are something. All sorts of egos are there. So best thing is to see for yourself; that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say, \xe2\x80\x9cFace yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYourself\xe2\x80\x9d means your Spirit.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, that goes the same for the superego?\n\nShri Mataji: Yes, very much so. For superego also - not to be frightened. You should just say, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out! I can see you very clearly, you are there. You get out from here! How dare you frighten me? I am the Spirit. I am the Spirit, how dare you can do that?\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s how. You see, ego makes you idiotic. Absolutely. Ego makes you idiotic, makes an idiot out of you, absolutely. And the superego makes you a coward. It makes you a coward. Now, how to fight it? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be an idiot\xe2\x80\x9d - if you say that, ego will go away. If you want to be an idiot, then he\xe2\x80\x99ll be there to help you. If you want to be an idiot, all right, call Mr. Ego. You\xe2\x80\x99ll become an idiot, straightforward.\n\nIs the easiest way. Easiest way. If you want to become an idiot, simple thing is to call the ego. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come, Mr. Ego, and settle down in me\xe2\x80\x9d - and immediately\xe2\x80\xa6 this is a very simple composition. And superego\xe2\x80\xa6 if you are a coward, then it sits on your head. Say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to be\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Ham Ksham, as I told you, the mantra on the Agnya is. Either you have to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x9d; the other, I say, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, may I ask You a question similar to what he said about superego? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be particular. I\xe2\x80\x99m still having problems with my eating. I\xe2\x80\x99m eating over here. But I\xe2\x80\x99m very afraid, I\xe2\x80\x99m laughing because it is silly, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll become fat. And I\xe2\x80\x99m very afraid, I think a lot about food all the time. Yet I know that with You nothing bad can happen to me,\nShri Mataji: All right, you do one thing just now. You put your left hand towards Me, and\nright hand outside.\n\nShe has the Hamsa here, caught up. There, you see the Hamsa. Tell her to come now. Come in, come in. I see, sorry. Put the Hamsa, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it clearly.\nHello [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi] We\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for you.\nCome forward, you can come forward a little bit. Lots of people are there. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]\n\nShri Mataji: What\xe2\x80\x99s the time now?\nSahaja Yogi: Quarter past nine, nine fifteen.\nShri Mataji: Quarter past nine,\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, that relationship with yourself should be tyrannical. You should lash it down.\nYou should absolutely make it clear to yourself that \xe2\x80\x9cI have to perfect myself if I have to give this my being to God. It has to be perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d Secondly, if you have to have relationship with others, it has to be ideal relationship. Sahaja Yogi with Sahaja Yogi - means something great. The greatest relationship is that.\n\nWith your sister, with your brother - it should be ideal. And in collectivity we have to be pragmatic. In collectivity we can change our course, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take the way we like, the way it moves; we\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it. But otherwise\xe2\x80\xa6 You see, for example, take a plane. It has the same thing. Plane, when it is in the air, it can go wherever it likes. But the screws that are fixed in a plane are ideally fixed. They cannot just start\xe2\x80\xa6 like a pilot seat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the back, and the back doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the front, you see. The relationship is maintained.\n\nAll right? And the screws which are made, or anything that is made - is perfect. But airplane is not fixed. Airplane can go southward, northward\xe2\x80\xa6 anywhere it wants to. Only the things that are in it are correlated with each other in such proportion that they cannot budge from their ideal positions. I\xe2\x80\x99m giving this example because you are here. You\xe2\x80\x99ll understand it better now. And these things that you have produced are themselves\xe2\x80\xa6 are perfect. If they are imperfect, there will be a problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s like that.\n\nIf you understand this very simple thing about relations and attitudes, you will never have problems. Your relationship with a Sahaja Yogi has to be absolutely ideal relationship. Otherwise, some screw is loose. Try to make it ideal. Say, there\xe2\x80\x99s one person. You find the person is too egoistical, or something. Try to see what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you, first of all: \xe2\x80\x9cAm I perfect? Am I all right? Or am I equally dominating, am I equally egoistical?\n\nAll right, if I am, then I better correct myself. But if I am not, if I am a good person, that way I\xe2\x80\x99m not dominating - then I should try to bring down his ego by making sweet things to him, making nice relationship with him.\xe2\x80\x9d Try to be kind to him, so that his ego comes down. Manage somehow or other to establish ideal relationship. Is absolutely simple. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what have I to tell in this thing. You know everything. That it has to be proper. Now see, the relationship between that and Me has to be proper, so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t burn Me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely\xe2\x80\xa6 in lifetime, also, we have to do the same thing - that relationship with each other has to be ideal to create the best results. It is so practical; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is there to tell in this thing. And you have to be perfect because you are the unit. And the whole thing can be pragmatic. Then only it can be. But here just the other way round. The screws are pragmatic, the relationship is imperfect, and the collectivity is absolutely static. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move. \xe2\x80\x9cThe collectivity. After all, we are collective, bound to each other. How can we move, Mother, we are static now. We are bound to each other, we can\xe2\x80\x99t move, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d Just like the Rock of Gibraltar. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been an aeronautic engineer, you should understand this better than anybody else, this example.\n\nWhat else is the question?\n[To someone]: How are you? All right?\nI\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\n\nWhat other question?\nRustom: Shri Mataji, could You say something about maintaining our attention so that it stays where it should and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get diverted into trivial things?\nShri Mataji: Rustom has asked a very practical question, it\'s true - that "to keep the attention where it should be."\nYou see, for everything you have to do some exercise - abhyasa - not before Realization, after Realization. The best way is to learn how to watch yourself. Just now, sitting here, just put yourself into a position from where you watch yourself: "Now what am I doing?"\nThis is the abhyasa, this is the study. Apart from mantras, apart from anything, the abhyasa is the practice, practice of becoming a witness. And the witness is the Spirit state. There attention will not go. I mean you will see everything, it is there, but attention will be inside. Try to practice this: "Am I a witness?"\nNow, say, some people say:" Oh God! I had a horrible time, Mother. This happened, that happened." You see, you are not a witness. How can you have a horrible time if you are the Spirit? You only have a horrible time when you are not the Spirit.\nIf you can watch the whole thing as a drama that is played, then you are not having a horrible time, but this outside of you is having a horrible time, which you are watching.\n\nThat\'s how the attention can be fixed very well if you practice abhyasas, practice all the time to be witness. Say, you go out, you see something, just try to see it, not to think about it. Be a witness of the whole thing. The joy will be complete, and also you will become absolutely peaceful. Your attention will be completely enlightened.\nAnd then the inspiration you will get will be tremendous.\n\nSee, it\'s working out. Working out. Try to watch. And it has such a tremendous memory, if you know how to watch. I mean, to Me, if I see something - I mean, to Me it is just like a film in My mind. If I have seen this room, now I know what is in this design. Everything I know: how you are sitting, what pose you have taken, how you were, what was it - everything is like a design. You see it comes to Me, just like a picture - absolutely. Not of this life, but of lives.\n\nBecause that\'s a recording system that records best. If there are thoughts it\'s like something in between, you see. Now he is trying to record Me on the film, and if there is something in between moving, nothing will come in. But when there is nothing in between and you are just seeing through, you are recording everything that is important. Moreover you will be amazed, you don\'t record unimportant things.\nLike for people now, they go to a village, or any place. They will be recording: "Oh God, it was very dirty, and this happened and we went there and there were cement to sleep, for example, we get." Or: "Then we went inside, and there was no proper chair to sit down. And the chair was so hard, and my back started aching." All these things they will remember.\nAnd then what happened? "Oh God! I couldn\'t get Realization."\nEverything that bad, you see, just like newspaper - all bad news. But to a person who is a Realized soul in a real way, he doesn\'t see, I mean, you don\'t smell anything dirty. You always smell something good. You never smell, you do not think of anything dirty. Everywhere you go, it\'s beautiful. Even if you see just the sand, you see the pattern. Even if you see a barren hill.\n\nI saw some people who had gone. I said, "Look at the beauty of these hills, in Maharashtra." They said: "Mother, what is the beauty? It\'s not covered with trees." I said, "That\'s the beauty, just see the patterns." They couldn\'t see the patterns that I was seeing. But if you ask Me, "What is this hill?" I also know that. Because I know the patterns of all the hills, how it has moved, how it has made patterns and things like that. Because they don\'t see that, you see, they cannot see the beauty because they are looking out for defects. Or relatively, you see, "English trees are better than say X, Y, Z trees. So then this is not better." The relative they start. But you are at absolute point, you are getting the absolute of everything. Everything is your own. What is there to judge?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.\nShri Mataji: Eh?\nSahaja Yogi: Perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.\nShri Mataji: I am the Artist and I am the Art. But what about you? Who are you? You are the\xe2\x80\xa6 you are the one who is created, and you can create, and you can become the artist. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying - that you are not only the light but the light that will give light to others. And, also, you will sustain that light which you have given light. This is the difference now between you and other people. Not that only you will be an artist but you\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy the art of the Artist. This is what you have got. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you are not aware of your powers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dynamic thing which has happened to you, which you should take to.\nBut our attention is on from where the dirt is coming, where the filth is coming, you know; where the ugliness is there. If your attention is on uglines- people tell Me: "There was, this was ugly." I said: "I didn\'t see." I just saw the way the elephant was standing, you see. The way he has pulled up his leg and he was raising his trunk. I never saw the dirt part of it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAt the back of it.\xe2\x80\x9d I say: \xe2\x80\x9cI never went on the back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf your attention is so- even description of a person. You ask a person, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d All his\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean, little funny points will come to your head. Even the photographers, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. They will only take photograph when you are in a funny way, you see; when your face is little turned round\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a seeking after ugliness, seeking after mistakes, seeking after something wrong. All the time if you do like this, you cannot be a happy person. All the time trying to find out defects, and faults, and mistakes, and dirt, and ugliness. I mean, you are in for trouble. You\xe2\x80\x99re asking for it. Like a person was saying there are three-four ditches in this place. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you jump into one of them? Better jump in. So, once for all, you don\xe2\x80\x99t see any other ditch.\xe2\x80\x9d You don\xe2\x80\x99t see the playing grounds, you are just seeing the ditches. For what?! The same thing can look ugly to a person who is of that kind of an attitude, who wants to see everything ugly. Try your attitudes. Try to see good in others. Try to see\xe2\x80\xa6 not in\xe2\x80\xa6 may not be\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying for other people, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying at least for Sahaja Yogis you can do it. Try to see good in them; what good they have done to Sahaja Yoga, what you owe to them, how to get along with them. Why not see the good of them?\n\nBy giving them encouragement, by being good to them you are helping Sahaja Yoga. But you want to help your ego, because you are very \xe2\x80\x9cwise\xe2\x80\x9d. So, then only, when by appreciating another person only, you have better relationship. This is a very simple fact. You see any film - there the two people are talking to each other as if they are barking at each other. What does it take to be kind, to be gentle, to say pleasant things? As soon as they will see a person - \xe2\x80\x9cOh God! You have become very ugly!\xe2\x80\x9d This is the best compliment. That\xe2\x80\x99s human nature - to see to the faults of others, to see to the wrong things of others.\n\nYou see, they will find out in anything. Somebody is very tidy - then that person is bad. Somebody is very untidy - that person is bad. Every sort of thing. But why not you do something about yourself, that there\xe2\x80\x99s something inside you which is not tidy? And inside you that\xe2\x80\x99s very upsetting. To Me it makes no difference, you have seen it. It makes no difference. If you say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep here. If you say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep on the\xe2\x80\xa6 on the grass there. To Me makes no difference to what bathroom I go\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember all those things. What is there to remember in a bathroom, and this, and that? All nonsense it is. I have no memory for all these things. Even if you want Me to know, I will not remember. If you ask Me, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you go to that bathroom?\xe2\x80\x9d - \xe2\x80\x9cWhich one?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat one.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there.\xe2\x80\x9d Then food.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a taste it was?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhat food it was?\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\xa6 all sorts of things people go on thinking a lot. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use? The whole food is going to just be digested in the same stomach. What is there to be so much worried about all these things? We are wasting our energy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t waste My energy. I have no energy for wasting. In the same way, why do you waste your energy? Why not see to the better side of man? By seeing bad side, if you can cure it - well and good.\n\nBut if you cannot cure it, you are going to get yourself bad. If you can cure it - nothing like it. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Also once\xe2\x80\xa6 always person say, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not do that.\xe2\x80\x9d But you would do something else that the other person would not do. When judging others, one has to know one should judge oneself first of all. Because with what are you judging? With your ego or superego. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very common failing, which should not be there any more. Now you are realized souls, you are saints. And the saints\xe2\x80\xa6 though olden saints might be doing whatever they did - forget them. But you people are not going to see the faults of each other but to the good points of everyone. Simple things I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen: somebody says a wrong English word, or a Sanskrit word, or a wrong this - immediately you will catch on that. But he gives a big lecture - it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. That nobody listens. Your mind is working: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat wrong thing he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say?\xe2\x80\x9d Attention should be onto what he said, it\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful. And then you will develop an attitude - as Mine is - you\xe2\x80\x99ll never see to the defects of the place. Never.\n\nNever. [UNCLEAR]. You will have no eyes to see. I mean, Mine is like that, condition is like that, I tell you. It will be like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult. Like somebody says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou come and play those cards with sticks\xe2\x80\x9d - I never remember. I\xe2\x80\x99ll always lose. So I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of play it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d See, everybody says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have so many brains otherwise, can\xe2\x80\x99t you remember these three cards?\xe2\x80\x9d I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s just My brain goes off. I put automa\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I look like a stupid fool when I play that game. So why should I play? Anything like that - I am absolutely good for nothing. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing people know: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, she is useless. Forget her.\xe2\x80\x9d But it should become automatic with you also.\n\nThen it\xe2\x80\x99s so enjoyable: how beautiful we are, that everything is so beautiful around us to see. Such beauty exists and we do not see it! Such tremendous joy! Every bliss is there flowing within us. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we don\xe2\x80\x99t notice it. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a happy thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a beautiful thing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, such a source of joy!\xe2\x80\x9d - was just standing next to Me. I never knew. And just I turned round and saw that force. Turn round! Turn your back to all conditionings of yours, the ideas that you have\xe2\x80\xa6 Do not pass judgement, first thing is. Great art critics and all that, please, I beg of you, that do not pass remarks at anything all the time. Is ego playing the trick. Just watch it, how it is making you feel that you are something very great. Be careful. There were some people coming from America, have they come?\n\nSahaja Yogini: Steve and Christine, they called to say\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: They haven\xe2\x80\x99t come.\n\nSahaja Yogini: They\xe2\x80\x99re coming in one week. One more week they\xe2\x80\x99re coming.\n\nShri Mataji: So then we\xe2\x80\x99ll decide, when they come here, what is to be done.\n\nShri Mataji: Linda, for your problem, what is the thing to be done? Will you get out of your personal problems or not?\nYogini: Yes Mother.\nShri Mataji: No, I\'m talking to Linda now.\n\nLinda: And, which ones?\nShri Mataji: I would suggest you should stay with your mother. She needs you. She\'s an old woman; she needs you. You must serve her. There\'s nothing wrong in it.\nLinda: Very possessive.\nShri Mataji: No, no, no. You are inadequate. Not that she is inadequate. You have to serve her.\nGive her love, affection. She\'s lonely. She behaves like that because she\'s lonely. You are inadequate. I wouldn\'t say to her anything. She never had love and you are the only child she has. You should love her. Give her more love, more affection, and also what she says about Peter, you should do that. Will give her consolation. She\'s going crazy because of that.\nSahaja Yogini: The trouble is, Mother, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like ten years doing Sahaja Yoga.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShri Mataji: Let her say. Her saying, nothing matters. You see that\'s nothing. That\'s just an escape. Because you are crazy, that\'s why she thinks like that.\nLinda: I know that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her of course.\nShri Mataji: But you should establish yourself with more patience, with more love and affection. She\xe2\x80\x99ll say: "Do a hundred times Sahaj Yoga." How has she changed her attitude: because when you went there you went crazy. And you are quite crazy sometimes I\'ve seen. First of all you must be a tidy person, neat person, must look after her.\nYou must take up a responsibility of looking after. She\'s an old woman who has had no love all her life. What she wants is love; and as a child, daughter, you must give her love. Whatever she is, you can\'t leave her alone. If you give her love, I\'m sure you can cure her. Take it up as a challenge and give her a bandhan. Everybody can give her a bandhan and put her right. You cannot be helpless like that to run away from your duties towards your mother, I will never allow you. You can go to Chelsham start a center there, attend it, do it. You have to.\nLinda: Do you want me actually to live with her?\nShri Mataji: Hum?\nSahaja Yogi: Should she live with her Mother?\nShri Mataji: Yes of course, why not? She\'s your own mother. She\'s not such a cruel woman. I don\'t think so. I\'ve seen her. But you get crazy yourself. I know. I know that. This is how you will test yourself.\nYou should live with her - after all she\'s so old now. What\'s her age?\nLinda: Sixty-four, sixty-three.\nShri Mataji: See now, at sixty-three if she\'s left alone in that house, what will she do? You tell her that "I\'ve decided to do what you have told Me about Peter."\nLinda: She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really told me anything about Peter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing most of the tellings.\nShri Mataji: All right, whatever it is.\nLinda: She wants to-\nShri Mataji: She\'ll be all right. You see, you try to tell her these things, she\'ll be all right. You tell her just like this: "And now I\'m going to look after you, you are very sick, you\'re not well. Take care." Did you talk to her kindly sometimes?\nLinda: Well, I tried.\nShri Mataji: No, you did not.\nYou did not, that\'s what it is. As a Sahaja Yogi you have to be extremely kind and compassionate towards her. She\'s an old woman, had no love from her husband. She has tried to do something for you always. So as a daughter, you have a duty.\n\nLinda: I\xe2\x80\x99m very worried about Bumble because it\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of 3-cornered arrangement which comes out.\nShri Mataji: What happens about Bumble?\nLinda: Well, Bumble sort of finishes up in between me and her. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\nShri Mataji: But if you finish off from yourself, she won\'t be finishing off like that. See, why do you create a problem between you and her, first of all? There should be no gap. If there is no gap, then there won\'t be any problem. The problem is because you are a problem and she\'s a problem, so the child suffers.\nBut if you just have nothing, if she tells, on the contrary, if a child tells anything about your mother, you should say: "Don\'t say like that to my- she\'s my mother." Tomorrow she will turn back and tell you that! Take it from Me.\nLinda: I mean in that way she\xe2\x80\x99s\nShri Mataji: She\'s much more sensible in this than you are. You should not tell her anything about your mother. You should say: "She\'s been very kind to me and nice to me." If it is communicated to her, if through Bumble, things will be all right.\nSee, how long is she going to live with this kind of life she has had. All right?\n\nWhere are you going to try your Sahaja Yoga if you can\'t try on your own mother?\nLinda: But she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it Mother.\nShri Mataji: No that\'s not the way. It\'s not outside; it is inside.\nLinda: I tried to cook for her but she would\xe2\x80\x99nt eat what I cook.\nShri Mataji: You don\'t have to do it outside, you have to do it inside with her. Be kind, be gentle, be of service, at the most she\'ll shout sometimes, doesn\'t matter. Forgive her, forgive her.\n\nLinda: I mean she has vomiting, which really worries me.\nMy mother can\'t sleep at night, wanders around talking to herself the whole time.\nShri Mataji: You see, it\'s all right. If she doesn\'t sleep, then you can say some mantras in your heart. You know there\'s a mantra of Nidra and all that ["Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu, Nidra rupena samsthita"]. You put her left to the right, she\'ll sleep off.\nYou do it all that, she\'ll sleep. You should say that: \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe, three times, heavily you\'ll sleep off\xe2\x80\x9d. And if you, when she\'s talking also, if you sleep off, she\'s not going to wake you up again.\nYou just doze off there and she\'ll say: "All right, you go and sleep now formally."\nIt\'s very simple to fight out these things. I mean she needs you, very much. She can\'t sleep. Just imagine, your mother can\'t sleep. How can you run away from her? Just see her condition. She\'s your mother.\nLinda: She is in a terrible state.\nShri Mataji: Then how can you leave her? You can\'t. You can\'t leave her. No, I wouldn\'t say that. You can\'t leave your mother.\n\nYou know, Kathy wanted to come with Me. Remember Kathy?\nKathy: Yes Mother.\nShri Mataji: And I told her, "You can\'t leave your mother in the hospital, come with Me to India. No, you can\'t." She missed that thing completely, I told her: "You stay with your mother." She\'s here, just ask her.\nLinda: Yes.\nShri Mataji: I did tell her. And she was cancer, this thing with the Sahaja Yoga, and all that, and she used to attend to her. She stayed back. No, you can\'t leave your parents like that, you see. Parents are very important things. After a certain age, you have to look after them. Whatever they are, you must look after your parents. That\'s very important in Sahaja Yoga. Your Right Heart cannot be all right, Shri Rama cannot be all right if you don\'t look after your mother.\n\nShe\'s not such a bad woman. I\'ve seen her.\nI, if she were a very cruel, horrible, this sort of thing, then I would have said: "All right, forget her." She\'s not that way. But she\'s not either so much - she\'s drinking because she has no company, she doesn\'t know what to do with herself. So she is trying to run away from herself. It\'s very simple to understand. You be kind and gentle. Give her some value that she\'s something to you, she\'ll be all right. I\'ve seen she\'s not a bad woman.\n\nLot of her sense has come into you also, her goodness.\nLinda: I\xe2\x80\x99m bothered I think by \xe2\x80\x93 when Grazyna came to stay she felt, Grazyna felt that she had this brother, you see, whom she worshipped. He killed himself in moto racing.She saw him dying in front of her.\nShri Mataji: What\xe2\x80\x99s it?\nLinda: She had this borther, my mother, who she loved very much and-\nShri Mataji: That I have heard of already. That story I know, whatever she has done, whatever it is.\nLinda: She seems very fond of dying [unsure].\nDoesn\'t matter. By leaving her, are you going to help her by that? You should fill the position of that brother! You should say, "Doesn\'t matter, if the brother is dead, I\'m here to look after you, mother." Why is she hankering after the brother? She thinks that if the brother had lived he would have looked after her in old age. But God knows if he had looked after, he would have run away, too.\nWhy can\'t you fill the place of the brother? You can. Why not? You take it up upon yourself. You can do it. I know. All right? You look upon her as you look upon Me. Why not? Just try. It is worth it. It\'s worth it. Be nice and gentle. Say nice things, pleasant things to her. Show interest in her life. Actually you see all of this has come from these psychologists also. Horrible ones.\n[Lauhgter]\nNo, they always say: "Mother did something." Everybody I saw they said, "My mother is like .." I said: "How can everybody\'s mother be so cruel?" Could be some people\'s, but not everybody\'s.\n\nAnd also if they have deviated from right path, it is because they never got their love, they never got their place in life. See, the husbands must have ill-treated them, tortured their lives and must have been after them, or maybe they had some other problems from their parents or something. Everybody\'s mother has tortured.\n[Shri Mataji is laughing]\nIt\'s a psychology, I think. That way a mother is in a way always, if you look at her from a wrong angle, she will look like your enemy.\n\nIn the West, the mother picture is horrible. Also wars, things have come in that generation. People have been shattered of their values. You must understand what kind of life this horrible Western society can give to women who are good. Good women are really tortured in this society. Only the smart ones and the ones who are very arrogant and who know how to put men right and women right in their places can exist, you see, this is what it is. It\'s a regular struggle here.\nAny good woman is tortured in this society. I mean, if she exists and she really lives, is something surprising. Ask, Maria will tell you. You ask her how they put them down, how they insult them, how - I mean, everybody has seen this happening here. But don\'t blame the mother all the time. At this stage, you must look after her.\nHum.\nSo now what is next?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Could You marry me and my girlfriend sometime in future?\nShri Mataji: What\xe2\x80\x99s it?\nAnother Sahaja Yogi: Marry him and his girl friend.\nShri Mataji: Who is your girlfriend?\nSahaja Yogi: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s not here tonight, she is-\nShri Mataji: She\'s not a Sahaj Yogini?\nSahaja Yogi: She comes from Bedfort. Yes, she is a Sahaja Yogini.\nShri Mataji: She\'s a Sahaj Yogini.\nSo you want to have a marriage on Krishna Ashtami? Some of the marriage to be performed? Sahaja Yogi: Yes, please.\nShri Mataji: Now when is the Krishna Ashtami?\nAnother Sahaja Yogi: Next Sunday Mother.\n[Laughter]\nSahaja Yogi: Some time in the future, not now.\n[Laughter]\nShri Mataji: You see, the best place to get married is in India. Very easy and you have a real feeling because you come on a horse and this and that, you see?\n\nBut even if you want to have in Krishna Ashtami day, I don\'t know if you can get really somebody to do it - if somebody we can get, we should do it if there are people who want to get married.\nBut you see Sahaja Yoga marriage is taken for granted. I\'ve seen people do not have that understanding, and it\'s very dangerous to play with it, it\'s very dangerous, you see? So I think if you have some time given to yourself, I will definitely marry.\nBest thing I think is [to] let people take some time and decide. Because, you see, it\'s very funny, nobody feels responsible about it. They\'ll come out with a explanation: "Oh, I didn\'t understand and I was not in a position to do it, I was still possessed with a bhoot and I married another bhoot."\n[Laughter]\nSahaja Yogi: Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with her two years.\nShri Mataji: With her?\nSahaja Yogi: yes, with her.\nShri Mataji: You see, you have given sufficient time now. But you see, one thing is their living is in the West, is simple people; but if you tell them "marriage", oh God. They go amok. They go amok. You see, if it\'s a marriage: "Ahhhhh."\nAsk David Prole, he\'ll tell you.\n[Laughter]\n\nYou see, because the law is so horrifyingly funny here, "marriage, oh God, it means horrible things. You have to separate. If you have to divorce- the first thing about a divorce: "You\'ll have to give so much money. " "Half money the wife will take away." "She\'ll murder me."\n[Laughter]\nYou see, they show husband murders wife, wife murders husband, all sorts of things you know all the time it is like going on in this country. It\'s madness about marriage.\nSo I think it\'s a good idea. I would like if you can arrange, because Krishna Ashtami\'s a good time to marry people. Our sixteen marriages, which one has failed? Last time. For the sixteen. No, sixteen here in London. Who were the sixteen people, let\'s see.\nAll first class. All first class, yah? Yah.\nGood.\nSo for next marriage lot. Some will be lagging behind like Nick, I would like him to marry. Now you\'re not so frightened are you? Nick?\nNick: No.\nShri Mataji: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s good. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]\nOn the Dashera day we can have marriage. The Dashera day, that\'s another day one can marry. Now Krishna Ashtami and Dashera day. Of course after the Diwali, after the marriage of the Tulasi, then only people start, but the Dashera day is very, very good. It\'s very auspicious. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]\n\nSo we\'ll have marriages on Dashera day. Till then prepare people for marriage. All right? The Dashera will be say about ... end of October, about. All right?\nSahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, thank you.\nShri Mataji: Let\'s find out where will I be.\nSo that\'s how.\n\nSahaja Yogi [Derek Ferguson]: Mother, I was going to ask, some Sahaja Yogis who\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Sahaja Yoga for a long time don\xe2\x80\x99t feel cool breeze; they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any catches. Some people feel burning all the time; some people feel these things in their head, in their body, toes, hands. It\xe2\x80\x99s the way we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna develop, where you can feel things - all of us, all over - or is it just some people feel different things?\n\nShri Mataji: No no. You see, to begin with, you see, it has something to do with your nervous system. All right? So, if your nervous system is disturbed, you may not feel, at all. For the nervous system, best thing is to do massage. You see, somebody should massage their back, hands\xe2\x80\xa6 Also, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told many a times that you rub your hands with vibrated olive oil, quite a lot, and rub these things, so they become sensitive. Could be with insensitivity. But if they can feel the catches in the body, that means they are all right, only the Vishuddhi is not all right. Rub the thing on the Vishuddhi, work on Vishuddhi, clear it out. And for Vishuddhi, if you can use, say, butter to rub on the- here [neck], and rub all these muscles, you see, with that. All these things will work out, for your hand.\n\nBut supposing there\xe2\x80\x99s no cool breeze coming out of the head, possibly. Then the Realization yet not has established. See, other people should say whether there is a cool breeze coming, because the person who is not realized may not feel it. Supposing he does not feel it, and you feel it, then he is realized; only thing, his chakras are to be cleared out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different different category of people. Then, there are some people whose Kundalini has not risen; they are still Sahaja Yogis. Like that. Maybe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there are any. Those people who are unmarried for long, they are very difficult people because they never feel the cool breeze in the hand, quite a lot. Like that. But it is not so. They are realized souls in any case. They may not feel it, but they are realized souls, you see. Because a kind of a softness, a kind of a balance is developed after marriage - which is not there. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how some people don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it. There are various reasons. Some people who are ego-oriented more - they should turn their left to the right many a times. They should find out\xe2\x80\xa6 from the hands, you see. One hand is bigger, one hand is smaller. That means the left hand - if it is smaller - that means you have to raise left to the right. You see, from the size of the hands and all that you can see it. Putting one hand towards the photograph, another hand outside\xe2\x80\xa6 Work it out in so many ways, because you have permutations and combinations of certain mistakes. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you develop this Left Vishuddhi by any chance. Because that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst thing that can happen. If you develop the Left Vishuddhi, then it\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult situation for you. Now, for this kind of a thing, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a complete lecture on one day. Complete. As to see what permutations and combinations of different chakras can create. All right? But symptoms are outside. The symptoms are mostly outside; there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to\xe2\x80\xa6 from a personality you can see what it is he is catching, you see. Is a very\xe2\x80\xa6 problem, great problem with people, that they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the vibrations; some people just don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it.\n\nHow many there are like that, who never feel any vibrations? Never felt, never.\nRaise your hands. I know Kerry.\nKerry: Not never.\nShri Mataji: And you never- you have felt it sometimes?\nKerry: Yes, yes.\nShri Mataji: All right.\nSecond Sahaja Yogi: Mother since I came to the ashram I`ve been, my hands have being very hot all the time.\nShri Mataji: Which one?\nSecond Sahaja Yogi: But I feel the catches inside.\nShri Mataji: Both the hands are.\nWhat work you are doing in the ashram?\nSahaja Yogi: Not very much Mother.\nShri Mataji: All right, you had a left side catch. All right, you can see clearly your right hand is very shining. The left, there is a problem. You see these fingers are not so shining as the things are. You had a left side problem, if you remember it. All right? So, that\'s fighting. In the ashram the vibrations are fighting, that\'s why you feel hot. There\'s nothing wrong with it.\nIt will correct; it will have cool breeze. Put your right hand always up and left hand towards Me. It will correct you.\n\nShri Mataji: When did you come?\nSahaja Yogi: (Italian) Last Wednesday.\nShri Mataji: Oh I see. You\xe2\x80\x99re staying here in the ashram?\nSahaja Yogi: No he is not here in the ashram.\nShri Mataji: No. Where is he staying?\nSahaja Yogi: In a Hotel.\nShri Mataji: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay here and get your Sahaja Yoga alright? He\xe2\x80\x99s from\xe2\x80\xa6now better. Alright.\nSahaja Yogi: He\xe2\x80\x99ll come tomorrow to the ashram.\nShri Mataji: Good idea.\n[In Hindi Shri Mataji asks someone if they are ok]\nSo now, can I go now?\n\nSahaja Yogi: We should offer You a sari.\nShri Mataji: This is Gavin\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a sari, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? What color is this?\n[PHRASE IN HINDI] What\xe2\x80\x99s it? What a beautiful one! Where did you take this one? It\xe2\x80\x99s like a painting. Where?\nSahaja Yogi: Sahastrara Puja in Paris.\nShri Mataji: In Paris? It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful! It\xe2\x80\x99s for Me or for the ashram?\nSahaja Yogi: He has brought it to You, Mother.\nShri Mataji: Thank you. It\xe2\x80\x99s too beautiful. Very beautiful it is. Thank you.\nMay God bless you.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here for sometime?\n\nSahaja Yogi: A week, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Week, all right, good. Christine, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and see you all, Americans, eh? Here, Monday. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss about what is to be done in the future program. Now. Anything?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, I have brought You a present.\n\nShri Mataji: Present?\n\nSahaja Yogi: For small [THING?]. Some photographs.\n\nShri Mataji: Thank you. I would like to see. It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? This is Italian style. See? Is Italian. They make everything so beautiful. [PHRASE IN HINDI] It\xe2\x80\x99s very loving and nice. You had taken this photograph? And enlarged it? Beautiful it is. Very gentle and nice. This is from that garden\xe2\x80\xa6 which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see? It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful lotuses Rustem has in Derbyshire. In Derbyshire, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that [ONE?], really. I was surprised, they say that you can\xe2\x80\x99t grow a lotus here. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they do it, really.\n\nSahaja Yogini: They call them something else, that sort of\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Must be. See this one. [PHRASE IN HINDI] [PHRASE IN HINDI] So beautiful they are. Rustem, you have become a great photographer.\n\nSahaja Yogi: He\xe2\x80\x99s got four years experience.\n\nSahaja Yogi: They grow in Hampstead, Mother, too.\n\nShri Mataji: Hampstead?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Yes, they are in the ponds in Hampstead [UNCLEAR].\n\nShri Mataji: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they manage it, you see, this cold. It\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous. But they grow in the cold because [UNCLEAR] also they have these. So, must be.\n\nSahaja Yogi: They can grow in the cold, no problem.\n\nShri Mataji: Now\xe2\x80\xa6 [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] Now, Harry, your problem is solved?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Not as yet, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Why? What happened?\n\nSahaja Yogi: I called my employers, and they said that they\xe2\x80\x99ve not quite sorted whether they should re-employ me. So they gave me one week. He said he will call me back next week.\n\nShri Mataji: Or you just go and tell them that \xe2\x80\x9cYou give me just an employment,\xe2\x80\x9d saying that \xe2\x80\x9cfor only three months at the most.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSahaja Yogi: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: But just say that \xe2\x80\x9cWe give you employment, we re-employ you,\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to there.\n\nShri Mataji: What else?\n\nSahaja Yogi: These ladies are too shy, Mother, to tell them to come in.\n\nShri Mataji: Who?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Some ladies to give You the sari, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: To give Me a sari? All right. This is the one that puja sari Gavin has brought. Who will give Me? Give it now. Come along, you girls. Also he has brought one sari for Me, which I\xe2\x80\xa6 use it on Janmashtami also, from\xe2\x80\xa6 [PHRASE IN HINDI] from Bombay. May God bless you. How is he? Did he get a job?\n\nSahaja Yogini: [UNCLEAR].\n\nShri Mataji: What did he say? He\xe2\x80\x99s not [UNCLEAR]?\n\nSahaja Yogi: He got a job, he is the head of all the translators in Spain.\n\nSahaja Yogini: He called me last Tuesday, he said, head of\xe2\x80\xa6 in the embassy\xe2\x80\xa6 of the translate people.\n\nSahaja Yogi: The chief translator, is the head of the translation stuff in the embassy.\n\nShri Mataji: Really?\n\nSahaja Yogini: He says he has a big responsibility now, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Good. How much is he paid? How much is he paid?\n\nSahaja Yogini: 240 pounds.\n\nShri Mataji: How much?\n\nSahaja Yogini: 240 pounds per month.\n\nShri Mataji: Two thousand?\n\nSahaja Yogini: Two hundred.\n\nShri Mataji: And forty pounds. Per month.\n\nSahaja Yogi: It\xe2\x80\x99s very reasonable course, Spanish [UNCLEAR].\n\nShri Mataji: For Spain, it is. It is very reasonable.\n\nSahaja Yogini: Also, he\xe2\x80\x99s work only six hours a day.\n\nShri Mataji: And where does he live?\n\nSahaja Yogini: He stay with Jose Antonio.\n\nShri Mataji: He\xe2\x80\x99s happy there? It\xe2\x80\x99s good that he\xe2\x80\x99s got such a good job. All right. What is this you have done?\n\nSahaja Yogini: Michelle made it, Mother. It\xe2\x80\x99s a [CROWN HERE?], Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: This you give Me on Krishnashtami, will be better. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, with this thing?\n\nSahaja Yogini: Michelle made it, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Michelle? Should give Me on Krishnashtami, all right? It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. All right. So just open the sari and put it on [UNCLEAR].\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, may I read Your hundred and eight names? May I read Your hundred and eight names? [IN WRITTEN?] shlokas.\n\nShri Mataji: Who? You?\n\nSahaja Yogi: Your names, yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Please, let read it out. Loudly. You have to raise it higher. Let Me garland [UNCLEAR]. It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful color. Thank you. It\xe2\x80\x99s very sweet of the doctor Singh to give such a nice job to him Don, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? He\xe2\x80\x99s a great man, doctor Singh. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] But we wanted some really Sahaja Yogi to go there. He knows Spanish also. But the doctor Singh is taking so much interest, I must say.\n\nSahaja Yogini: Mother, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only for three months.\n\nShri Mataji: All right. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said, that three months [IT IS?]. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. It may go further.\n\nSahaja Yogi: He will have excellent reference after that work.\n\nShri Mataji: Now he can go to other places. He\xe2\x80\x99s not so attached to anything; I found it from him. You see, Don is a very deep Sahaja Yogi, very deep. And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so particular about Spain. Any place You send me, Mother, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be going.\xe2\x80\x9d So he\xe2\x80\x99s not so much attached to\xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s a very deep person. That was a good answer. So he can go somewhere else if he says,\xe2\x80\x9dIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that I get attached to Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. But you better grow now. Did he tell you what is the problem is? And must learn proper English, you see? That\xe2\x80\x99s very important because Sahaja Yoga\xe2\x80\xa6 I cannot speak all the languages. So better try to learn. In here, people should teach English to people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know good English, all right? Not that English language is God\xe2\x80\x99s language, but at least I understand it. Otherwise, all the English will have [A BIG EGO?]. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t learn so many languages, all right? Try to learn English language and, also, understand Sahaja Yoga mentally. That\xe2\x80\x99s important. Because you have to explain to people, talk to them. Because you talk, but it makes no sense on the other people if you have not mentally equipped. Those who are just attached to Sahaja Yoga with heart must equip themselves also with mind, must understand Sahaja Yoga with mind, is very important. And those who only understand with mind should understand it with heart. All right?\n\nSahaja Yogini: To reading \xe2\x80\x9cThe Advent\xe2\x80\x9d, Mother, is very useful, very helpful to overcome this problem, because I had the same problems.\n\nShri Mataji: All right. Try to read \xe2\x80\x9cAdvent\xe2\x80\x9d, explain to her, let her understand. How are you? You never came to the\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nSahaja Yogi: Unfortunately, I had to work.\n\nShri Mataji: I see.\n\nSahaja Yogi: But I [FORGET TO LET YOU KNOW?].\n\nShri Mataji: All right. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] [UNCLEAR] mangalsutra? You got two? One will sufficient, one you keep it for the next puja. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] You must get one made in gold. When I go to India, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you one. It should be used for puja. [PHRASE IN HINDI] And the same can be used every time. May God bless you.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, please forgive us for any mistakes we\xe2\x80\x99ve made during Your puja.\n\nShri Mataji: May God bless you. Make a list now, and get it verified sometimes. And make a complete list, you see; so whenever you go there, try to remember. You keep one ready. Otherwise, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for it. Because it goes little funny there, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look all right. Because you are such matured Sahaja Yogis. It is all right for children to make mistakes, but you are all matured people, so - doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look nice. May God bless you.\n\nSahaja Yogini: Mother, for Hampstead we do not know so much the protocol of pujas and how to\xe2\x80\xa6 to behave in\xe2\x80\xa6 there is no [ASPECTS TOWARDS YOU?]. Then, how do You suggest we should educate ourselves?\n\nShri Mataji: Next time when I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a lecture on this, all right? Because requires a real one big lecture, Maria. May God bless you.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, someone is bringing You some food. Food is being brought, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: No. You see, My family people are going to have food with Me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. They are all at home. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I have to go.\n\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi'
