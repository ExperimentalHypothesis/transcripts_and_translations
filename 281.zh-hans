母亲的忠告 英国布赖顿1979年11 月15 日
布赖顿(Brighton;译者按..Brighton有照亮的意思 ),这个名字是那么漂亮。它要照亮整个国家。我到过这里两次,我常常感到若有机会的话,我们真的要在这里大规模地发展霎哈嘉瑜伽。有一天,这里将会变成一处朝圣的地方。在布赖顿有很混合的能量,这里有海;而且,母亲大地在这里有特别的意义。当某些神性力量开始散发,邪恶便会到来,伪装起来,积累力量,开始攻击神性,这就是为甚么我感到布赖顿有混合的能量。整体上,这是一个好地方,霎哈嘉瑜伽可以在此昌盛。

他们一定告诉了你有关霎哈嘉瑜伽。’Saha’(霎哈) 的意思是「同在」,‘Ja’(嘉)则是「与生俱来」。这是一种瑜伽,你追寻与神的联合是与生俱来的。在你内里,每个人都曾说:「在内里追寻他。」耶稣基督也曾这样说。意思是你必须追寻,这是你的自由。这自由是不可以被挑战的,你必须去请求。例如,若神能在人类现在的知觉状态,在你们不须进入这出戏剧下,就能把你们转化至更高的知觉状态,祂一定在很久以前已经做了。但祂不能,所以你必须在自由意愿下追寻神性。

你肯定是正在追寻,或许你不知道你在追寻什么。但有一点是肯定的,你对事物现在的状态并不满足,你想追寻某些超越表面的东西。毫无疑问,有某些东西是超越表面,所有先知、所有经典、所有降世神祇都曾讲述过,也曾应许过——还有——有一天你会受审判。最先要审判的是你自己。你自己决定你是在追寻神性或其他琐碎的事情。若你是在追寻实相或真理,那么,只有你会被挑选,只有你才会是天国的子民。

现在,让我们看看谁是这个神以及看我在说些什么。开始时,只有宁静,完全的宁静。在这宁静之中,当它被唤醒,宁静也被唤醒。这宁静被称为「Para Brahma」,很抱歉,我要用梵文,这并不代表这是某些印度式的东西,这种想法你必须摆脱。在印度,人们静坐比较多。他们不用像我们今天那样,在进入这会堂时,与大自然对抗。这里的气氛是非常友善和温暖。人们可以在树下静坐,他们不用对抗大自然太多,所以能长时间的入静。通过入静,他们发现很多东西,为此他们需要运用梵文。所以,这Para Brahma,或你可以说,这絶对的宁静被唤醒。它自动被唤醒,自然得像我们睡觉,然后醒来。跟着这宁静变成我们所称为的至高湿婆神(Sadashiva)。当它被唤醒或当至高湿婆神开始有感觉,它开始要求,它期望去创造。正如我们所说,早晨的阳光穿过黎明。同样地,当这欲望开始显现,欲望变成「他」的力量,得到分隔。现在,无论我说什么,对你来说,也只是一个故事,你不须相信,但我会渐渐的让你相信,一步一步,你会相信这理论。对你这只是假设,所以,当这欲望变成了一个力量,这力量被称为Shakti或摩诃力量(Mahashakti)或太初之母(Adishakti),意思即原初的力量(Primordial power)。这原初的力量假定自己的个性和实体。若它想作出行动,必须这样。若你心中只有愿力,那并不好,我们必须把它转化成某些形相,否则,那欲望只会上上落落。所以,这愿力转化成有形相,我们可以说,进入了实体,那实体在圣经中称为圣灵,在梵文中称为太初之母。接着,这愿力从自己中再创造出两个力量,一是作事的,另一是改善自己的创造。所以,这三个力量开始起作用,就是这样,这三个力量被创造了。现在,你们也知道,没有太多人讲述圣经中所说的圣灵。很多经典有提及天父但并没有提及圣灵。特别是耶稣的母亲是圣灵的降世,他不想危害她的生命,他甚至没有说她是圣灵的降世,因为若他们把她钉上十字架,他将会与他的毁灭力量一起显现。但那出戏剧必须上演,她必须保持沉默。现在,这圣灵对我们是很重要的,因为天父只是旁观者,祂正在静观那出戏剧,那出圣灵所扮演的游戏。祂要去享受她所创造的。祂是那出游戏的唯一见证者,她想以创造来取悦祂,因为创造是祂的愿望,所以,她用这些力量来创造,我们已经得到的,被称为最先­——愿力(Mahakali),第二是行动(Mahasaraswati),第三是支持或你们称为——进化(Mahalakshmi)。这些力量创造了我们——人类。现在,我们已到达可以谈论它的阶段。在耶稣基督的时代,人们不能谈论圣灵。请你们告诉我,对那些渔民,我该怎样做,你怎能告诉他们这些?只是一些准备的工作,但你们知道,他们却做得一塌糊涂。人们不能明白,那些称自己为宗教的,是那么的混乱。他们怎能这样狂热?狂热主义与宗教是刀刃的两头,他们不可能是同一样东西。你可以看看现在的伊朗,在每一处,也看到人们是如何狂热,他们是那样没有宗教信仰。因为宗教是爱,神是爱。信奉宗教的人,没有一个能以「爱」应该被表达的方式来表达爱,没有一个承担起追寻神的工作。他们在做其他的工作,如博爱的工作,收集资金或安排大的买卖等等。这不是追寻神的人所做的工作。在这情况下,当我们面对组织宗教或破坏宗教的人和虚假的人,我们真的感到很灰心,我们感到目瞪口呆,不知道该怎样做,因为我们天生是寻道者。我们在寻道的过程中,可能犯错,但我们絶对是寻道者。若你并非寻道者,你会对参加某处的晚宴或舞会感到高兴。但不是这样,有某些超越表面、应许过的、你感觉到的东西,你感到它的存在但你仍未到达它的源头,这就是为什么你仍在追寻。

现在,我们内里有三个力量。在左边的是你的爱,你的愿望力量,因此我们期求,我们表达自己的情绪。当这愿力不再在我们内里,当我们感觉这愿力在我们内里消失,我们也同样的消失;在中央的是灵,它是父神在我们身上的反映或神的见证,它是在我们心里;在右边的是行动的力量。

这三个力量被创造得像在我们的注意力和「他」之间的一块屏障。这块屏障存在于我们的幻海,肝脏支撑着它。这三块屏障令我们远离「灵」。灵,我们看不见,感觉不到,不能把它彰显。我们知道有人知道它。在薄伽梵歌(Gita),它被称为「KshetrAgnya」,是那方面知识的认识者。所以我们知道,有一位认识者知道有关你的所有,他把你曾经做过的,你的追寻,你犯的过错,你的紊乱,所有你曾经做过的事情,全都纪录下来。而纪录下的都放置在下面的三角骨中,称为灵量。这是我们愿望的剩余力量,意思是当创造整个宇宙的时候,这愿望的能量,那太初之母,在创造了整体后,仍然保持完整,因为她是完全的。那是非常容易明白。我们可以说,假设光和电影,光反射在整部电影里但电影仍然保持完整。同样,当她投射了自己,仍然残存的,是那剩余的力量,是那灵量。这代表你是灵量的完全投射。那力量,那愿望的力量以二个力量显现——在右边的力量——称为行动的力量,和在中央的力量。你已经进化至某一点,其余的是幻海,它是负责你从亚米巴虫进化至现在这个阶段的力量。

我们应该提出一个问题:「我们为什么要从亚米巴虫变成人类?假若我有些螺丝,螺母等等,我把它们集合在一起。跟着,任何人可以问我,「你为什么要这样做?」我会说:「我要做一个扩音器。」但即使扩音器已经有一条线,它也需要接驳总机。除非它接驳至总机,它是不能操作。这就是我们已经得到了——那三个力量和那剩余的力量,剩余的力量是愿望的力量,就坐在这里,期望你的重生。她是你的母亲,当她期望,当她看到权柄,看到某人拥有力量把她提升,爱她如她爱我们,她才会开始行动,只有这样她才会提升。并不是玩什么把戏,不是站在你的头上,不是做什么运动,不是殴打人,不是做各种这样的事情。他们已经想到怎样把她提升,自自然然的,很霎哈嘉的,很自然地,提升她。我的意思是就像有人来到你面前说:「你可否保证我的灵量可以得到唤醒?」我会说:「不,先生,我很抱歉,或许可以,或许不可以。」若你不争辩,不争辩太多,她是可以升起。为什么?若争辩有什么事情会发生?

我一定要告诉你,争辩会有什么发生。我并不是说你不应争辩。你一定要,因为我知道你有一个问题,你太懂识别争辩。没有关系。当你争辩时,你利用了你右边的力量。通过思维,什么会发生,你制造了那黄色的东西,那黄色的东西一般被称为「自我先生」。当你思考时,这自我像这样升起,压向另一边的超我,超我是从你的制约而来。所以这自我,若像这样坐着它,我们怎能提升灵量,因为那里没有位置,没有多余的空间,它是需要像这样的平衡。所以争辩,令我不能提升灵量。所以为什么我说:「让我看看它,不要争辩,只在乎现在。」但人们不喜欢这样。你看,他们感到受挑战,所以,我说,「照做吧。」什么事在你争辩时发生,思维不继的压迫你,所以当你争辩,当你阅读时,你不能提升灵量。

你不可以付钱购买它,絶对不能用钱购买它。神并没有店铺,祂不懂购物。你亦不能组织祂,我们不能组织神,祂组织我们。所以任何有组织的活动都不能成事。

那是絶对像种子发芽一样,你只是把种子放入泥土及放点水。正如我所说,我放下爱心的水份,我给予你一点爱心的水,那么它自会发芽生长。你有一颗种子,在你内里的一颗苖芽,所有条件已经完备,它必须发生。生气并不能成就事情,用任何你懂做的方法都不能成就事情。你必须不费力气。你不用任何力气就令种子发芽,你甚至不能把一朵花转化成果实。实际上,我们所做的并不多。我们所做的,只是把死物变成另一种形态的死物,再从这形态转变成另一种死物,就是这样,我们没有做任何有生命的事情。这是活生生的生命过程,所有的生命过程都是自自然然下完成。

所以,自自然然地它升起。当它触及你的顶轮,你开始感觉双手有凉风。在印度的经典中,以saleelam-saleelam(意即凉呀凉呀)来形容这种状态,这清凉的风像波浪般来临,在圣经里,我们也读到凉风,整个力量是愿望的力量,它以清凉的凉风彰显成太初之母的三个力量,它是完全遍及的。当灵量上升,它穿越那些轮穴,触及它们。那些能量中心是精微的中心,位于我们的神经丛之下,在我们已知的医学上,那是我们内里的神经丛,跟着,我们得到自觉。

我不能为此给你一个演讲或把你洗脑,要你变成有集体意识,这个实践体现(actualization),是我们必须追寻。那是必须在你内里发生,所以你才变成现在的模样。这并不是向任何人标签自己为霎哈嘉瑜伽士,不能这样。霎哈嘉瑜伽士必须得到真正的洗礼。他的脑囟必须变得柔软,灵量必须穿越它,只有这样他才是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。

你们不可以有会员制度,不可以有这样的东西。那是很自然的发生,若没有在你内里发生,那么你仍不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。直到它发生,你仍在追寻。在像孩子一样的人身上,只一秒之间,就发生了。但在曾经伤害自己的人身上,它可以很长时间才发生。实际上,在这个国家(英国),我见过很漂亮的人在这里出生——诚恳的、诚实的和谦卑的人。远古伟大的寻道者被祝福,在这里出生,也在美国出生。但他们变得没有耐性,因为没有耐性,他们尝试毁灭自己,这样你们会伤害那些会受心理影响(psychosomatic)的能量中心。这些能量中心,将会短暂有问题,你必须有这些问题,你是为此而生,这是进化过程必然发生的,你必须认识自己,必须得到它。

寻道的路径并不苛刻,只要请求就可以了。「谦卑的人有福了」这句话已经说过。谦卑而非傲慢。若你坐在我的头上说:「给我自觉。」那么我会说:「我并非那位施予者,但你却是那位接受者。」就像流动中的恒河,若你把石头抛入河里,你不能从河中拿到水。你要找一个水罐,一个空的水罐,把它放入水中,水自会装满罐。是你的请求得到履行,你需要找出怎样实行,若没有这实行,你不能感到快乐。

在伦敦,当然有霎哈嘉瑜伽士,我们的进度像蚁一样,原因是很实际的。你看到其他组织在传播,在那里,你付钱成为伟大的部长,这样的事情在那里发生,你戴上一个小盒,变成了伟大的假导师的伟大门徒,这样的事情在发生。这样做是非常容易,是不是呢?但要成为霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你必须面对自己,观察自己。当美丽在你身上展现,你可以看到这是真理,你必须接受和给予。

不要感到有压力,因为这是我的工作。你可以说我是付钱而做的。给予你自觉是我的工作,我必须要做的工作。你的工作是接受它,因为这就是你在这里的原因。不是责任的问题,是爱,只是爱。我必须爱你,你必须接受我的爱。爱只是流通,只是散发。

我只是告诉你怎样去接受爱。但人类的爱,你看看,是那样具侵略性。我们不能明白,若有人说:「我爱你。」我们会逃跑。「你爱我,那么我最好还是逃走。」因为爱代表占有。人类的爱代表支配,具侵略性。但这爱只为爱,它令你平静,令你提升至一个新的面向,令你通过你的指头,感到完全的启迪,你的双手可以告诉你,自己那一个能量中心有阻塞,别人那一个能量有阻塞。

霎哈嘉瑜伽士拥有很多祝福,我正要在我的讲话里告诉你们,或许其他霎哈嘉瑜伽士也可以告诉你们。

我不知道你的问题。若你有任何问题和提问,我乐意与你谈谈,但不要太长。因为霎哈嘉瑜伽士为此很担心。首先,他们向我提出很多问题,他们愧于回想那些问题。其二,他们感到很刺激,为甚么你们不首先获得自觉?为什么你们不停的提问?你们最好得到已经在你们手中的东西。第其三,他们发现有时提出的问题,对自己和对别人都是没有价值。

所以,有一点你要记着,这里没有任何东西在兜售。你不需要付钱购买它。那是某些正在流动的,某些没有人知道它存在于这个世界的东西。只是流动,某些漂亮的。若你在某处看到美丽的景色,你只要观看它。你就是要以这样的态度来到这里,只张开你的眼睛。张开你的眼睛­__­­­­­­­­_______那是被称为Unmesh,即对那美丽张开你的双眼,那是你自己。为此你必须准备妥当,毫无怀疑,因为没有必要怀疑。但若你仍然有怀疑,我乐意解答你。无论如何,有时我们会提出一些好问题,我曾经见过有些人提出一些很好的问题,令我知道问题出在何处,这类问题也非常欢迎提出。但不要坐下来就抱着怀疑的态度,此其一。霎哈嘉瑜伽是一个大课题,那是非常困难去整体的解释。借着它,你获得身体上、精神上、情绪上和灵性上的整合,因为所有能量中心都起作用,开启你生命的四个向度,开启了整体,所以你感到在集体意识里的益处。那是一句颇复杂的句子,我已经说得很简短,但若你仍有任何问题,不用害怕,可以问我,我是你的母亲。

31:31

Are you all right? Good, you're feeling. They are born realized too. You'll feel, find out that in final mentally they are born realized. When I'll tell you, they'll take over till they knew all the fruit.

Some questions? Something? Better ask Me now because while realization, it should not be brought from somewhere, you know. Some of you stop thinking, if you notice. One really.  When the Kundalini rises above this center, you stop thinking.

(Question of a seeker about the image we have of the yogi living in isolation.)

Shri Mataji: Little loudly.

Seeker: One has heard, I was informed the venture of a yogi, as a half-a-yogi being I learn, and telling just himself is falling into this non-existence door specular and partnering that in isolation and continue to live in isolation and this is a protection to...

Shri Mataji: Who had?

Seeker: One has, one counselled so

Shri Mataji: Correct, correct, I agree.

Seeker: But this isolation is so, maybe he is now too captive.

Shri Mataji: But then how would you come to Brighton? You see from God's point of view. These yogis they live in the hills. They do even now. I have told them, they know Me very well, "Why don't you come down?" They don't want to. They are running away from you. Why? They know you will never understand them. They do not want to be crucified. Those who dared to come down were crucified and were killed. They are not there out of their own choice. They are there because they are running away from the madding crowd. You have to have a big heart to come down on this earth to face people who are blind.

This concept that you have is very good but of no use. They cannot come to Brighton. They won't even come down from their hills. I know so many of them in India – and they know all about it – they wouldn't do. They said, "No, we do not want to chop off our heads. Actually, some of them have broken their legs, some of them absolutely in a paralytic condition. They are all caught up. Some of them are on bed and they don't know what to do with themselves. I had to go and cure them.

It is true but to have such a concept itself is – we are having a concept about God again and that it should fit into that concept. Now they are not going to drop from heaven like that, are they? And are they going to talk to you? First time I have learnt English in this lifetime. How do they know English? They will just sit there with big stones in their hands. Anybody comes there they will be hitting. They don't want to see anybody's faces.

So, this is the idea of a yogi is and you cannot conceive of an idea of a yogi who lives in this world. Now Sahaja Yogis have to live in this world and not to run away to these far-fetched places hidden from everyone. We have to enlighten the whole world, not one - few persons individualistic, sitting down there and doing nothing. They are absolutely useless for our purpose. I tell them. They say, "After twelve years we will come." Now, what am I going to do? Am I going to pickle them down there? They are in the pickle state, doing nothing at all. I mean, are there so many like that and they have tremendous respect for Me and I know they always - sort of they have told all the Sahaja Yogis also about it. And when some Sahaja Yogis went to see one of them he said, "How many of you are willing to give your lives for that?" So, the Sahaja Yogis didn't know what to... They said, "We all can give life for Her." And I said, "Why do you want to take their lives for nothing at all?"

You see, these so-called 'Sahaja Yogis' who lived on the things have no idea as to what the world requires today. It requires peace. It requires complete evolution. They are just bothered about their own single evolutions. How far will go? You cannot anymore go because in the nature you have seen that nothing grows like a mango tree growing up to eighty feet, does it? It doesn't grow like that. In the same way anybody who tries to go like that goes out of place.

The yogi is a person who lives in this world. Is – the concept has come to you because some of these horrible fake ones have created this concept. You know, the great yogis of our country who are regarded and respected till today have been living in this world and never went away into the jungles. Say, like Guru Nanaka who was a great saint he says, "Kahe re ban Khojan jai,sarab niwasi sada ulepa tohi sang samai." [Dev. transcriptor's note: Internet links this sentence to Guru Tegh Bahadur who thus synthetized Guru Nanaka's teachings http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/gurudwaras-in-india/gurudwara-gurusar-sahib-patshahi-nauvin-village-kattu ] He says, "Why are you running away to the jungles? What are you afraid of? The one who is detached, the one who is the saint is living within you. The one who is the yogi is living within you. Where are you running away?"

So, these are the yogis and you can be one of them. And despite that I must tell you one thing, they are quite jealous of the Sahaja Yogis is a fact. Because they cannot raise the way – Kundalini – these people can raise. You'll be amazed. It's true. I must tell you this is a fact. They were saying that, "Mother what have you done?" Then we have a tape of a very great yogi from India. He says that, "What have these people done that You have given them vibrations while – he says – I was a frog for twenty-one thousand years I've practiced and then I've got my vibrations. And these people just like that getting vibrations. Why?" I said, "Maybe is the whim of God. Why are you sitting on the top of a hill there? For your own achievements, for your own courtesy. It's sort of a hypocrite in a very subtle way I would say."

And why are they there frightened of others, you see. You have to emancipate the whole world. Christ didn't go and sit on a hilltop or somewhere. No one. Rama did not go. Krishna did not go. None of these great saints like Tukaram, Gyaneshwara we have had. And all these they lived as married people, absolutely normal. And they are the people who are respected.

So, the idea of such a yogi is all dramatic, I can tell you. You'd better go and see some of them who are there in the horrible conditions as they live.

There's another one who lives in the Himalaya place called Amarnath. There he lives, you see – funny fellow. And he had one disciple – one disciple he had – and he sent the disciple to a suburb of Bombay, litlle – not suburb, I would say city near Bombay – small little place though and he said he formed an ashram there. And one of My Sahaja Yogini was staying there. So, he went and told her that, "My guru has told me that Mataji is going to come here after twelve years and She is going to raise my Agnya -Agnya Chakra." So, he went and asked the lady. She called Me he said, "I've been waiting for You for twelve years." Is a fact. You can go and see and find out. So, she was quite surprised that his guru has told him twelve years about Mataji coming here. It is quite surprising, you know. They didn't know that there was something about Me. And she came to Me and she told Me about this. I said, "All right, I'm coming to your place. You tell him to come and see Me."

He had ashram of his own. He was staying there and I said, "All right tell him, 'I'll come to your ashram'." He of course came to My program and all that and he was flat on the ground because he saw some things and all that but then he said, "Mother, my guru is waiting for you. Better come in the evening." I went down and, there, you see, I asked that guru, I said – of course first he was – all the rituals were done and then I asked him, "Why did you not clear his Agnya for twelve years?" He said, "Who cleared my Agnya? Why should I clear his Agnya Chakra?" I said, "I doesn't matter but you know how to clear." "Yes, I know but I will not clear his Agnya. Let him suffer." So, I said, "But what's the use of suffering?" He said, "It's very easy." "Why should you make him suffer like this?" He said, "I have suffered so much so he should also suffer." But then he gave him a big slap – I was between them. I said, "Why? Why did you beat him? It's very bad." He said, "No, you know, before, just before your coming he was smoking here. He has no shame of any kind."

And he was just, you see, going on like that. I said, "Why? What has happened?" He said, "You know, he came here, three days he put me upside down on the well and he said, 'Your smoking has to go'." So, that's how they are. Then I said, "All right, come along." And the Agnya can be cleared just like that you can also do it. But, you see, what happens there: they have achieved it through their terrible penances and all that and naturally they also expect people to do all that penance and go down there.

Now the individualistic is over. That was all right because in the beginning only one or two flowers become fruits but the blossom time comes, then many have to become. Unless and until all of them come down to this earth they are of no use. I can't understand their use. They are just sitting down there. Of course they work out certain things sitting down. Being – being sahaj, they are also collectively conscious so they may work out certain things and all that. But still you have to come and work with the people.

Supposing if you are away from the river and if you say, "I'm thirsty", what is so great? But if you are near the river and can keep your thirst then you are something great, isn't it? Living in the desert, if you say, "I am controlling my hunger and I am controlling my thirst and I have no attachments", it has no sense. Where are you great? If you are so strong enough anywhere you are, you are a sanyasin. You are detached.

Have you read the story of Sita's father, Janaka? He was called as Videhi, Videhi. He was the only one in the whole history called Videhi. 'Videhi' means 'a detached person from his being' like that 'he doesn't care for', as you can say 'a real yogi': 'Videhi'. The deha is the body. He has gone beyond the body. And he was the one who had children, who had wife, who had his kingdom and who was a great, what you can call a great connoisseur of heart. And when Nachiketa went to him because he was with a guru and whenever this king came to him the guru would get up, touch his feet and make him sit on his seat, so Nachiketa asked his guru, "Sir, why do you touch his feet? He is a householder. Why should you touch his feet? Why should we all get up? Because he is the father in law of Rama, that's why you do it, is it?"

He said, "'No, not because of that. Because he is Videhi. He is the one only who can give Realization. Even Yoga Vashishta could not give Realization. He is the only one who is authorized to give Realization. We cannot give Realization."

So Nachiketa went to him and asked him, "Sir, can you... (interruption) ...known myself."

He said, "Why do you want to know? It's rather difficult." All those things he showed and tried to see if he is really willing. See, for a non-willing person it is rather difficult. So, he took his test and all that and he said that, "All right, I'll see about it."

Then he asked him to sleep in a room where he saw that it was very lavishly decorated and all gold everything and he was wondering, "What sort of a yogi is this surrounded by gold and everything. He is sitting down here and he is supposed to be the greatest yogi of the ages. How is he called a Videhi?"

Because he was a king. That was his life and that's what he was like that. He was not taking money from anybody else, or [peer else?], other people's money. He was not a parasite. It was his own kingdom where he was living. So he looked it, he was surprised.

So, next day Raja Janaka told him that, "All right, now first of all let us go and have bath in the river." So, they went to the river, both of them were having a bath. While having the bath a message came to the king that, "Your palace is on the fire." So, he said, "All right. Just now I'm meditating." He didn't say a word and, "Don't disturb me." Still he was meditating. Then the message came that, "Your people have all come out of the palace and they are going away." Then the message came that, "The fire is coming this side and your cloths and all those might get caught fire." Still he was meditating. But this fellow who was in the – supposed to be the yogi, the one who had gone to learn detachment – ran outside for his cloths, you see. He couldn't – even he had very few cloths but he ran outside... (Interruption.) [Nachiketa] "...about these things which are so important like a palace and your family and all of them were running away." He said, "I was in tune with God. That is the Truth. The rest is all falsehood, is all Maya, is all illusion. And why worry about the illusions?" And he too had only one disciple only he gave Realization, is Nachiketa.

This is the trouble. If they could give Realization en-masse they may come down but they cannot. And one person born on the tenth floor, the rest on the ground floor cannot make them understand. They cannot understand him.

That's why Sahaja Yoga had to come as Mahayoga, as the greatest Yoga.

The manifestation today is of Mahayoga where you meet the divine, where thousands and thousands have to get it. The time has come. I call it the blossom time. Some people say it's the destruction time, some say it's the Judgement time, but I call it the blossom time. And this is the time when you have to receive it.

These concepts are not going to help you. They have never helped you neither helped anyone. So do not have concept about it, just have it. Once you have it then you practice it here. No use doing it in the forest because when you'll come back again then you will live in the same condition. Here you develop the immunity. In this world where you live among your family, among your people, here you develop that immunity.

You will know evil is evil and after Realization you will not like it. Gradually you will come up so well that evil will disappear. You will have to do it here in Brighton. Under all evil circumstances, we have to establish it. That's what it is. It's much more daring and much more challenging than to run away on the Himalayas very nicely and sit down there.

Whatever you are earning, whatever your life, wherever you live is perfectly all right. Nothing to be given up. If you are not holding to anything what is there to give up? This is a concept people don't understand, you know. Like these 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna' they came to Me also. They said, "Mother you have such a nice house and your husband is so well placed in life and you have everything around– while we have given up everything." I said, "What have you given up?" "Oh, we have given up this and we have given up that and that." I said, "Really? All right." I said, "You worship Shri Krishna?" They said, "Yes, we worship Shri Krishna." I said, "All right, now whatever you think here on My body or in this house worth the dust particle of Shri Krishna's feet you can take away. Even up to the dust particle you can take away if it is worth that much. So you see around everything. Whatever you think is equal to the dust particle of his feet you can take away." Now this was too much for them, they didn't expect. They went round and round. They said, "Now we don't think that anything is worth it." They gave in. I said, "What have you given up? These stones? The dust? Why do you live in myths? What are you going to give up?"...

51:18 (Interruption.)

...When it happens to you, you really enjoy it. Everything that he has created for your enjoyment. All this universe is created for your enjoyment but you don't have that sensitivity to enjoy it because you have a sense of possession. If you possess this room - if I possess that will be a headache. It's nice to have it for you people and I come and nicely talk here and go away. No headaches. So all these ideas are mythical. This is a myth also to feel that I possess this room. I mean, you cannot possess anything. You have to leave each and everything here.

What do you possess when you go? Your Self Realization. Then you'll be again born like these children are Self Realized before so they are born today as Realized souls. And they have been saints. They have been living on the Himalayas also but now they have come like brave people in this world to face the reality. It's not easy. After Realization you will know what I'm meaning.

All right? It's good. Today you don't have to give up anything. Nothing. It's just here within you. But Nanaka has said, "Unless and until you have got your Self Realization, this Bhrama, this illusion, this misunderstanding won't go. It's the curtain has to [be] moved."

52:55

Yogi: Three o' clock now

Shri Mataji: Now, how many of you are noting cool breeze in the hand? Just put attention to the hands. You are all realized souls. So, no problem. You are great. They are not complicate. Put both your hands [towards Me], feet on the ground like this, you see, for mother earth to correct your problems and thinks, you see. It's only a question of disintegrated being within, you see, like, "This is not corrected, this is loose, this is loose, this is loose, this is loose." These things are to be properly connected and this is to be put to mains. So these are the two problems that we are also disintegrated first of all and secondly we are not connected to the mains. So this disintegration also is brought to one by the Kundalini rising because She pierces through all your beings and put you together. Once you are integrated, then it works out faster.

Now see for yourself just like this. Just like this in this way. Sit most comfortably and just await this happening to you. You may close your eyes and see if there are any thought in your mind. Ask your mind, "What are you thinking?"

(Shri Mataji and the Yogis begin helping seekers to get their Realization.)

The back [probably Mother or a yogi is gently taping a back where there is a blocking.] You try this here.

55:10

I hear you all not forgive others. Please forgive. Just say that, "We forgive." Forgiveness is in captioned but it's a myth that you do not forgive. And what do we do after all by not forgiving this? Only troubling ourselves. Just forgive. Just say that, "We forgive." Then only you can be forgiven for your mistakes. That's why again and again you must say that, "I forgive" and "Please forgive us."

All right? Good! You are better? See. Looks out. Are you getting cool breeze? Little.

Yogini: Good.

Shri Mataji: What about you? Are you getting? Very good. This gentleman? Are you? Not yet. Are you getting cool breeze? Not yet. Left Nabhi very much. You know the left Nabhi problem is? You are all right. Don't you worry. Now is it? Good.

Close your eyes and enjoy. This is the best time when you get it. This is the highest. Remember it! Because you will find it that after some time you will start thinking about it, you may lose it, so petty think about it, what you call. Just feel it. Feel the relaxation.

Left Nabhi is too much. You don't pay attention to one particular point. Keep your attention absolutely free. May people have a habit of looking into this – what you call – in between the two eyebrows or sometimes higher.

(Interruption.)

Let pay attention to your fontanel bone here on top of the head. If you find your attention to be very variably, then let us leave it alone. That's the best way.

1:00:55

Better? Left Nabhi's? Good. Where guru you have [been]? See don't you get worried. That's the use that they are doing to people. Is it okay? Still a little one there. Better now. It works. That's such a collapse, quite a lot. There leave it. It's painful absolute. Now better. Are you getting the cool breeze? Not yet. Are you? This one. Not yet? It has started.

Now how is your Hamsa today? You're welcome.

And what about this gentleman in the corner, behind Me? No. He has got it...

1:09:00

... They say tendency is here a harm, here, that people sort of feel guilty about everything. There is nothing to feel guilty. In a people, you can feel this. They say something is happening in Vietnam, they feel guilty about it. Of course, if you are in the collective consciousness, if you feel that, then you can feel bothered, but otherwise mentally if you feel guilty, then it creates a problem. So just say, "I'm not guilty of anything." Just say that. After all this [body] is the temple of God and in the temple of God, there is a light [Atma]. I mean I have no business to despise it in any way. All right?...
