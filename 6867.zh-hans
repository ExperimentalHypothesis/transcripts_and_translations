公开讲座:违背了神的旨意

1983年3月31日 英国,汉普斯特城演讲厅

从一开始我就很抱歉,今天这么晚.我知道当某件事在神的眼中是非常重要的时候,所有的负面力量便开始计划着如何拖延、如何阻拦、如何使其脱离正轨、如何妨碍。真是非常令人惊讶!今天,最好是由我来告诉你们有关于神的旨意,以及我们人类如何无时不刻企图违背祂的旨意。

神的旨意其实是很单纯的。祂是神圣的爱、祂是慈悲的、祂是慈爱之海洋。祂创造了这世界,然后创造人类,只为了要给他们生命里最高的事--就是喜悦。喜悦是单纯的,不像短暂的快乐一般有二元性。但我们是如何违背神、违背喜悦的,这又为什么会发生呢?

我们的意识,就如你所知,经过我们的头脑向下成长。而这向下生长让我们远离神。最终我们是要达到神。但是首先我们稍稍地偏离那与神合一的意识,是为了要了解自由必须被适度地使用。没有经由训练、教育,给予人类自由是无用的。你看过自由的国家。他们在自由之中建立了什么?毁灭我们自己的原子弹!这是愚蠢的,这是愚昧。这是荒谬。但是我们已经都这么做了。我们还以它为荣,我们仍然忙着让我们的处境越来越糟。这就是我们做的事。这意识,我们人类自己的意识,被赐与给我们,好让我们的自由被试探、实验、观察。到最后,拥有终极的自由,藉此你变成灵。

最终,你必须变成灵。

但当我们开始发展我们所谓的意识时,我们关注的不是灵。我会说,我们像树木一般扎根于泥土中好站直生长;我们脑中也有像这样的根。然后我们开始向上生长,向上生长直到长出叶子、花朵盛开、结实累累。但相反地,在达到结实的阶段之前,发生在我们身上的是,我们开始制造出人造的叶子,并享受它们,我们喜欢人造物。一旦开始认同人造物,我们便开始偏离真实,走向负面的想法,或走向过度积极的想法,这些实际上是违背神的,就是因为这些让我们制造原子弹以及这一切。

因此,确实有两条使我们走偏的岔路。有些人喜欢走向左边,或是负面的态度。他们毁灭自己、困扰自己、做各式各样的事情,借着这些会让他们用最悲惨的方式死去。他们自己患上各式各样的疾病。他们折磨他们的身体;他们折磨他们所有的一切。然后另一条是右边,在这边是他们去折磨别人,去毁灭别人,去击败别人。这两边都远离了神,远离祂的慈悲与恩典。关键是从头到尾都要走向灵性。唯有如此,才是朝正确的方向前进。但这个关键很容易地被人类破坏,因为他们有自由去这么做。在他们的自我中,他们大量地破坏,当你们发展出人工化的轻松生活时,那么已失去神的意识,祂的存在,祂就是那位导演这整出戏的。我们变得如此地意识到我们自己,然而我们觉得什么都没有错。我们做这、做那、陷入各式各样的问题之中。我们所做所为正是违反我们自己,而我们自己意味着神,因为神创造我们,并且祂爱我们。我们不爱自己。如果我们爱惜自己,我们不会滥用我们的身体、我们自己的系统、以及我们所拥有的一切,说着:「有什么不对?为什么不这么做?」你必须爱你的身体、你的心灵、以及这个社会。你必须爱你所拥有的一切,因为神在祂的爱中创造了你。但爱本身已变成一个严重扭曲的字眼。

现在,滥交有什么不对?这是爱吗?如果我跟你说这不是爱,因为这是违反自然,会给你带来麻烦,你会陷入混乱。人们也许会觉得这位女士很严肃,她很保守、很维多利亚式。听着。这是事实。我们为何要做些会造成毁灭的事情?你不能创造你自己。你甚至不能为自己创造一朵玫瑰花,更别说整个身体了。那么为什么我们要违背我们自己?为什么我们要违背这个我们所创造的社会呢?或违背我们所创造的整个国家或众多国家?时下这些政客——他们在做些什么?争斗。为着什么?去看看他们。我不能了解争斗是为了什么,是为了创造更多毁灭性的力量,创造更多恐怖的事物好去毁灭无辜的人吗?那些无辜的人们只被简单地警告。他们不知道该做些什么。他们不了解为什么明天他们就将要死去就因为一些人发了疯!而那些疯子坐在我们的事务指挥着。负面就是这样在我们内在成长。使我们变得负面。这两者都是负面的态度,因为他们否定了神。

否定神是我们犯下第一个罪。我们不畏惧神。祂是慈悲;祂是仁慈;祂是一切。但在祂的慈悲中,祂会毁灭这世界。祂不会容许更多违背祂的罪行再被犯下。甚至不惜毁灭。癌症是什么?所有这些找上我们身体的疾病是什么?它们不是别的,正是我们自己内在建造的毁灭力量。无须惧怕任何来自我们外在的攻击,或是任何外星攻击、外层空间入侵也都不用害怕。不,没有这些。我们应该知道这些攻击都是在我们内在造成的。以自由之名我们已在自己内在积聚所有毁灭性的微生物。它是一个这样的内建程序,我们甚至不知道这些攻击即将到来,它们已经就位。而我们太满足于我们自己,我们人工化的生活、繁文缛节以及肤浅的习性。

与生俱来的,在我们内在,存在着灵体,祂想要启发你,想赐予我们自身平安、祝福与喜悦。你的这盏美丽的灯被创造是有其目的性。它必须被点燃。尊重你自己。在今日的字典中「尊重」这词已经不复存在!尊重你自己。我们要尊重这盏有着灵体之光的灯,它应该要被点亮。让我们也成为那盏光辉灿烂的灯。神已经为我们创造如此美丽的世界,但我们在我们的无知里,在我们所谓的自由之中,已经毁灭了这么多的东西。

看见人们直接地朝向地狱前进,这真令人惊愕。对一个母亲而言这是她非常关心的事。如何才能止住这种堕落?如何把他们拯救出来?如何让他们了解他们的价值、他们的可贵?你不应该把人类生命视为理所当然。这是非常珍贵的生命,由许许多多的过程所创造。它的创造是极度困难。不要忘了你必须变成灵,要不然你的生命就白费了。不只如此,整个的创造都白费了,因为你是创造物里最高的,你是那个创造的缩影。

然而你要怎么做呢?我们必须成为公开谈论神的核心份子。我很惊讶地发现,这个国家的人不喜欢谈论神。你不能谈论神。你能想象这是怎样的处境:你不能谈论你的创造者,或这样的信仰毫无意义?你们要不就是形成某种秘密组织,加入其中的每个人都不能说「现在我们属于某个宗教」。神怎么会有这些不同的宗教?只要去想想,祂怎么会有分别的教堂、分别的庙宇、与分别的清真寺?我们怎么能以神之名变得狂热!你能够想象吗?这就是我们对神所做的事!我们已经变得狂热。神点石成金,祂所碰触的任何东西都变成金。但是得先有石头,当祂碰触人类,他们变成像囚犯一样。这就是为什么会有这么多的宗教狂热份子。因此,如何传达「你是灵,你必须成为灵」这新闻、这讯息是个难题。

我的母语是马拉蒂语,感谢神,我出生在马哈拉施特拉邦。因为这是圣人的国度。成千上万的圣人住在这国家。这是传统,它的灵性非常高。崇尚灵性是我出生地的传统。「马哈(Maha)」的意思是伟大,「拉斯特拉(rashtra)」的意思是国家。这里的传统是灵性而非酗酒、滥用药物或是任何其他的「主义」。灵性是这国家的传统,一位非常单纯的诗人诞生于此,他的名字叫纳德夫(Namdev)。他是位裁缝师,只是位平凡的裁缝师。但他写下许多甜美的诗句——我会解释他所说的。「小男孩正放着风筝。他看着天空,和朋友聊天;他跑来跑去四处谈笑。但是他的注意力一直在风筝上。」然后他说:「一位女士正背着她的小男孩做家事——她倒水给丈夫喝、与孩子坐下、煮饭,然后起身清洗。孩子在她的腰上,正在休息。她的注意力一直在孩子身上。」「一位妇女在头上优美平衡的顶着一壶水,与其他妇女一同行走。她们边走边谈天说笑,但是她们的注意力一直在水壶上。同样地,我们的注意力要保持在灵上。」

同样地,我们在这生活着,这是荒谬的,我们并没有将我们的注意力放在灵上而祂是生命中最根本的给予者。但每当你谈及灵,人们认为这些都是废话、不值得一听。他们想要一次又一次地听着那些俗事。如果是像保守党或工党的广播节目,他们可以一连听数小时——这类的世俗事务。年复一年你们都在听。但如果有人说:「不,这全都是人为做作,你们内在有更值得你们去倾听的东西。」他们认为他们还没有要去聆听这些事:「这位母亲正在告诉我们的是什么?」但现在,醒醒吧!在不同的层面上,我们要去了解这些人迄今所做的,而我们已接受。这么多年来我们视为理所当然的一切已超过了界线。一颗星星在我们的内在闪耀着,那是我们的灵。

人们谈论祂,谈论神,然后又创造一个宣称他们在执行神的工作的宗教。在「神的工作」中,女性绑起她们的大腿和抛光自己的肉体。想象一下!以神之名做出这么恐怖的事情,理由是,「你必须要苦行。」你为何要让自己受苦?「因为基督这样做。」你是基督吗?而这意味着基督所做的一切都白费了,所以你们之中一小部分人也得受苦!之前基督经历过的一切早已远远足够,因为基督是圣子。如果圣子必须遭受苦行,那又有什么好伟大的?祂早已完成了这一切,祂为了我们工作。祂要在我们内在被启发,这就是为什么我们必须得到自觉。

坐下来问问题是最简单的事,但最好是你们都得到自觉。这是今天最重要的事。当然,现况下人们是如此,所以这不会很快地成就。我非常肯定。我已尽我所能。提升灵量就像举起崇山峻岭一般。这真的像举起万山峻岭。你觉得非常累、精疲力竭。但之后他们又不想珍惜。所以不要觉得失望,不要对此感到受伤。

我确信,慢慢地、逐渐地,在你的双眼里,人们会看见你的生命如何被转化为喜悦、祝福与谅解。他们会看见你变得多么地有爱心以及喜乐,然后,他们会相信你有着更为美好的生命。有些人处在这种不良的状态里,他们每件事都只看到黑暗的那一面。他们失望透顶、彻底放弃。他们就是放弃了。他们会说:「现在我们会随之完结。我们已经做了所有一切,而我们现在一点也不想再多做些什么了。」我曾在法国目睹。他们讨论着世界的崩溃与近在眉睫的毁灭。他们谈论着:「让我们现在就死去吧。我们已经受够了。让我们遭遇最终的毁灭,无论是原子弹或是什么的。毁了我们吧。」多么地绝望!我可以了解会这样想的人的绝望,会这样关心的人的绝望。我也为此烦恼。我毫不怀疑人们会为此感到绝望。甚至霎哈嘉瑜伽士有时会非常沮丧,变得极度绝望,说:「放弃了,母亲。我们已经随之完结,我们再也无法承受。」不过我不知道如何把我的注意力从灵体上移开。你可以试试看,尽你最大的努力去移开注意力。你做不到,因为你就在那儿。因此,无论如何,你会奋力尽可能去拯救更多的人。所有这些在一定的间隔就感到挫败的霎哈嘉瑜伽士,我必须说,你不应该感到沮丧。你要去维持你的勇气以及谅解,如果你关心别人,如果你对别人关怀,他们会了解你,而你能够让更多更多的人得到拯救、解放,他们将得以进入神的国度。如同你正在享受的,他们也将会享受。

唯一的隐忧是你会觉得有这么多人仍旧迷失。没关系。你要努力工作。我们必须了解有诸多负面力量正在把他们往下拉。他们是无明的,他们不知道有超越这世俗斗争之外的生命。那美丽辉煌的永恒生命。但是逐渐地,我确信,这将会成就。特别是对这次会议而言。他们遭受许多的起起伏伏,而整件事令人丧志。

但我们仍必须了解,神的工作是被神所祝福的。祂将赐予你祂所有的祝福与协助,让你能担起你想要的责任。时间分秒流逝;现在只剩下很少的时间。时间即将用罄,这就是为什么绝望逐渐增加。绝望本身把霎哈嘉瑜伽带到这个地球上。你应该要感到更为坚强,去与周遭那些你所察觉到的阻碍奋斗,成就这个创造的终极目标。

愿神祝福你!

Now, ask Me questions if you have any, without any fear, but not irrelevant, stupid questions, you understand that. It’s not good. I would not like to waste time of people who have come to seek the Truth. So, please ask Me questions if you have any or we will go in for the Realisation.

No questions? Wonderful people! No questions at all? Yes, yes please....

Seeker: It’s not really a question it’s just I find it hard to hear what you are saying. Is there a way of adjusting the microphone or something?

Douglas Fry: He can’t hear at the back but unfortunately the microphone is at maximum so we’re not able to get...

Shri Mataji: You can’t hear?

Seeker: No. It seems to distort.

Shri Mataji: It’s not alright? What did he say? I didn’t follow.

Shri Mataji: You couldn’t get any words to yourself, did you say that? Same with Me, I can’t hear you. (laughter) It’s mutual but doesn’t matter. You see, even if you have not heard Me, makes no difference, nothing. Love has no language, and this Divine Power has no language, alright? Did you understand that much?

Seeker: Not that much.

Shri Mataji: Did you follow Me even that? I am saying that love does not require any language. It is an all-pervading power which is everywhere and, whatever may be the language, it makes no difference. It is a silent language which will work it out.

I was surprised some of the Sahaja Yogis who went to India were very silently meditating when I was speaking in Marathi or Hindi. And, I was amazed how they were so attentive. They said, “Thank God! We did not understand, Mother, what You were saying, so we were not putting out mind into it and we were just enjoying the vibrations.” Isn’t it surprising that they would sit for an hour or so just listening to Me in some foreign language? Alright, doesn’t matter, alright!

What’s wrong with your thing, you see? Acoustics are wrong? What’s wrong? They can’t hear Me.

Douglas Fry: The microphone is as loud as it can be and I think there’s probably a problem with the loud speakers themselves. Unfortunately we’re not able to get to the controls. We can’t get to the controls Mother like we can at Caxton Hall.

Shri Mataji: Alright? Sorry, for this, some sort of a mechanical problem. But doesn’t matter, the mechanics in you are perfect. I don’t know a word about this electricity business that you people have created, not a word. I don’t know how it works, but as far as your Kundalini is concerned, I’ll work it out. (laughter) There’s no problem on that!

Alright. The acoustics of this town hall may be wrong. Alright. Now, what should I do if they can’t hear Me? Can you hear Me now, the gentleman, alright?

Seeker: I think [Shri] Mataji, one of the things is you have a soft voice and at the end of the sentence the voice disappears.

Shri Mataji: What about Sahaja Yogis, you heard Me fully?

Sahaja Yogis: Yes.

Shri Mataji: There’s a little difference, I’ll tell you. I must confess to you very humbly, that when a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me I find it difficult to understand, but if a Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me, is easier. I must confess it’s a little deficiency with Me, is that. That’s why if anybody asks Me question, even in the first row, I’ll ask some Sahaja Yogi to tell Me what’s there, because My ears are, I think, little bit not so alright. So it is with you people also may be that once you get your realisation. Now, the Sahaja Yogis are sitting at the back and they can hear Me every word. So there’s something wrong with this voice of Mine, because it doesn’t adjust to your ears, for the frequencies, I think. Doesn’t matter, it will work out. Alright?

Seeker: The only thing is it’s difficult to understand if you don’t hear. Are You saying it’s not important to understand?

Shri Mataji: No, it is important to understand, but not to think about it. Forget it. Forget it. Don’t think too much. Whatever you don’t to have to understand, you better not understand because sometimes, you know, talking becomes a barrier, and listening is another barrier, and then thinking is the worst. Alright? (laughing) So, let us see how it works out. Alright? Let us see how it works out within. You will gradually understand what purpose My speech serves, gradually, alright? I have to speak with a purpose, but what is the purpose? That you will understand little later if you don’t mind, but just now you must understand the purpose of your life, that is your Spirit and get to it. Now is it clear what I said?

Seeker: That sentence, yes.

Shri Mataji: Yes, alright. Thank you (laughing). Now, let us put our hands towards Me, and Me towards you. Now, I think, you see, this also slips out. You see, I’m very bad at electrical things. I never know even how to open My radio. I am so hopelessly bad. So, if I’m making mistakes, you should not mind because I am nothing so mechanical, you know. I don’t understand.

So, what you have to do is to be relaxed in the sense that don’t put any strain on your neck or on your body. But sit straight, and no strain on the neck at all. Neck, we have strained too much. So, leave it in the centre, not too much at the back, nor too much in front, but keep it in the centre because this neck has a problem. Alright?

Now, you have to stretch you hands straight like this towards Me and close your eyes. That’s all. You have to take out your spectacles, if possible, because it helps also your eyes. And, take out your shoes, if possible. One should not have anything tight on the waist or in the neck, little bit loosen. If it is not uncomfortable, that’s alright. If it is comfortable then it’s alright. First thing is you should be comfortable and not disturbed. That is the main thing and not to have any fears nor any guilt. That is very important not to have any guilt. Whatever I have said I have not said for you, so you don’t have any guilt built in you. Just say, first and foremost thing, after closing your eyes that, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Say it thrice with full confidence. I request you to say that. Please say that, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please! This is how you respect yourself. You have no business to condemn yourself because you are the temple of God.

Seeker: Mother I am not guilty

Shri Mataji: Just say it in your heart, but with full confidence, not doubting yourself at all. For My sake, please don’t doubt yourself. Just say, “Mother, I am not guilty.” And, forget about what you have done or anything, forget the past. I am talking about the present, at this moment. So, just please say, “Mother, I am not guilty.” It’s a very important thing.

Now, keep your eyes shut, please don’t open them, because once the Kundalini starts rising, you have to keep your eyes closed, and the attention will be attracted inside and after it reaches the Agnya Chakra then you will become thoughtlessly aware. There won’t be any thoughts but you will be fully aware. So, please don’t open your eyes till I tell you. This is one thing you have to do. That’s all. Not to open your eyes till I tell you.

Now, the left hand should be towards Me, throughout. Left hand is symbolically indicative of your desire. And, the right hand is your action. So we have to use the right hand to express our action. The first thing, as I told you not to feel guilty but I know you are all feeling still guilty because I can feel on your chakras. Now will you please again say it three times, otherwise you’ll be punished for thirty-two times or sixty-four times. That’s the only punishment you have to have is to say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

Now, put the right hand on your heart. Heart. Here resides the Spirit, in the heart. So with the left hand towards Me, open towards Me, you have to say, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

Now, you must know when you are the Spirit you don’t need anybody to guide you because you will be enlightened by your Spirit and the Spirit will guide you, because after realisation, you develop a new awareness by which you are guided through your vibrations. So you have to put your hand down on the left hand side of your stomach where to say, “Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide? Am I my own guru?” Anyone of these questions you can ask ten times. Establish your confidence first, that you are the Spirit which is above, detached and is the source of joy, complete source of joy. With confidence you have to ask these questions. I am here to answer them. So, please ask the question in your heart saying, “Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

Put your hand on the left hand side stomach. Here is the centre for the establishment of your guru principle, your masters principle. You are the master, as I say, of your body, of your mind, of your intellect. You are not to play into them, but you become the master. You don’t need any guru. You become your own guru. That’s better now.

Now, raise your hand again to your heart. And now, with full confidence you say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.” This you have to say twelve times, because the centre of the heart has got 12 petals. So you have to say 12 times, “Mother, I am the Spirit,” with full confidence and respect of yourself, which you are. You are the Spirit, no doubt, but just assert!

That is how we are clearing our centres.

Now, raise your right hand to your left side at the base of your neck. This is another centre which gets caught up when we feel guilty. Now, those who have said that, “I am the Spirit,” you must know that Spirit can never be guilty of anything. It is a sinless, beautiful, brilliant diamond within you. It cannot get contaminated by any guilt. So, you have to say now here eight times, “Mother, I am not guilty.” For those who have always felt guilty can say sixteen times.

Now, raise this hand on top of your head, and put it at the fontanel bone area which was a soft part in your childhood and put your palm on top of it, on top of it, let it rest. And now move the head in a clockwise manner, pressing it down with your palm. Just press it down and move it in a clockwise manner. If you do it from the side you’ll do it better. Hold it from the sides, put your hand sideways, not from front, [then] you do it better. And now turn it, little bit pressing it down with your palm. Turn your hand, not your head. At this point, again, your freedom is to be respected. I cannot cross over it. So you have to say that you want your realisation. You can say, “Mother, I want my realisation. Please, may I have the realisation.” Please say it seven times, just pressing it. You must touch your head. It’s all hot, you can see that, the heat is coming out. You must touch it and press it down, and see such a lot of heat is coming out. Now, seven times you have to say it.

After that you can raise your hand and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in. This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So you can ask a question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Every one of you, you can change your hands now. You can use the left hand. Put the right hand towards Me, keep your eyes shut and ask the question, “Mother, is this the breeze...?”

All of you should get it, it’s possible! Change your hands again, if you want to. You go on changing, and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out. It has to be cool breeze. First the heat will come also is a good sign that the heat is going out, all the heat with tension and all that, is going out.

Hmmm! It’s working out. It’s very subtle. We are moving from gross awareness to a subtler awareness of the roots, so naturally one has to pay attention to it.

Little in front, it is not at the back of the head but little bit in the front side. Try one after another and pay attention to it.

It’s very hot today!

Hmmm. Now, without opening the eyes, again put back hands towards Me, like this, and see if there’s a cool breeze coming to your finger tips to begin with. Just put both the hands and see if there’s a cool breeze. Ask again the question, “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Ask thrice. Means the Kundalini, Kundalini is the Holy Ghost.

How is the lady?

It’s alright. Don’t worry, she’ll be alright. She’ll be alright. Don’t worry, don’t worry, she’ll be alright. Don’t worry, she’ll be alright. She’ll be alright. I am looking after her. She’ll come. She’ll be alright.

Now, if you are getting cool breeze in the hand, you can also now see it, if you raise your hand. Open your eyes and raise your hand, slowly open your eyes, slowly. Raise your hands like this. Like this, as much as you can stress, let’s see.

Yes. Are you feeling? Are you feeling the cool breeze? Are you feeling the cool breeze now? Those who are feeling should say, “yes.”

Seekers: Yes

Shri Mataji: Alright. Now just put your hands like that and see now if you are feeling the cool breeze.

Close your eyes and enjoy yourself. Just enjoy yourself. Close your eyes. At this time there are Sahaja Yogis here who will help you to completely establish the experience and to see if there are any obstacles. Sahaja Yogis should do it very carefully without talking and raise the Kundalini in some people if necessary in some people. Don’t talk to them, don’t touch them, just start raising their Kundalini. Slowly try to do it. Keep your eyes shut, they’ll work it out for you. Now those who have come for the first time and have felt the cool breeze raise your hands first of all. First time who have come and felt the cool breeze raise your hands higher. Yah, good. It’s good. So, please put down. Then did you see them? Can you work on them and see. And those who have not felt please raise your hands: at all, the cool breeze. For the first time who have come and have not felt the cool breeze, raise your hand.

Alan, behind you, the gentleman who could not here me. Alright, then it’s alright, he’s done. Now just see the people who have not felt the cool breeze. Please raise your hands please...this one gentleman, this lady, this gentleman...
