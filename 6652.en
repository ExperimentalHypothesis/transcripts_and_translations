Welcome Talk. Perth (Australia), 27 March 1991.

Hello. How are you? Hello. So now, so we are here in Australia. So we had a Puja in the morning. Ram Navmi Mahavira will be the best topic.


I knew it was something wrong there. After all if you –TM means what? You know actually today, I discovered more things, that these people had come and there were a couple of husband and wife and a young girl and they told Me about they have some gurus, Harbhajan Singh and Amar Singh, and all that people round the world. And what surprised Me was that these three, three of them were so badly caught up and they were so sick and they went to the doctors and everybody and nobody could cure them. They got cured just in no time when I was there at the airport, but the main part is that when they mesmerize people. So these people are coming as Sikhs and mesmerizing all the people, and that’s why all these Sikhs are fighting each other, and from Punjab, you see. All these terrorists are all Sikhs and they are all mesmerized. So what they are doing they have no idea. Because I was wondering how can they kill innocent children, innocent people? Even Sikh people they are killing. Whosoever there comes in their way they are killing! That means there is some sort of a possession, and that possession is this that these gurus have put in. This one called Amar Singh. He comes to Perth also before Me, and all these Sikh communities have been harmed by that. Very bad thing.


Really, it can’t be explained, but now I understand why these people like mad are killing so many in Punjab. There are mesmerized killings. And they take lot of money, they told Me today. They take lot of money for this Harbhajan Singh. There is another one they told Me – Amar Singh ? and they said they go to Perth and they have got all the, and they are minting money.


They are all possessed people. See, they go away to these gurus, need to go to gurus. Now I will tell you, there is one Bhajan Singh from America, one Harbhajan Singh from Patiala and one Amar Singh. They called themselves as saints and they come here and put bhoots into them. Just give them mantras and do things and take money and do some sort of pujas, some rituals. Tantrikas, must be these tantrikas.


Those may not be accepted. They will pick up things like this, like these people are picking, and those who are accepting them must be becoming really terrorist. Openly.


Christian Group? Can you imagine Christian group?

But they should be all exposed. This is the point. They have so many illegal things, like they told Me that this man, Amar Singh, has illegal passports. So I said, “To what countries?” Basically, he is an Indian, but Indians cannot have two passports, and he has five six passports, they were telling Me. So I said, “Then why don’t you report?” They said, “If we report he will kill us.”[unclear] is a mafia.


Recently I read a book about Vatican connection. So Two billion dollars of these securities, of course, illegally they printed. Can you imagine, counterfeit? Two billion dollars Vatican. With the help of the mafia, mafia leader. Such a big book reads like a novel. One inspector of police got after them and he found it out. How can he explain?


In the name of God do all these things. They are not afraid of God at all.

 
[Mother cleaning saree and talks about saree.] This I bought. My granddaughter liked it  [unclear] for an old woman.


I wanted to show you a very wonderful thing. Let's have the birthday cake. I didn’t eat at all in the morning. How many birthday? And then in Singapore they all came and wished Me Happy Birthday. The Chinese are great, I must say. Once they take to Sahaja Yoga, they are so serious.


Sahaja Yogi: New people coming in Malaysia.


Shri Mataji: Malaysia is doing very well. Very serious people. It was not a holiday. Last time we had about thirty-five or so. This time also we had, I think, thirty-three. 


I just wanted to show you something really miraculous. You see, my eyes are funny. I forgot I can [unclear: read without]. You see, we had in Ganapatipule the birthday of Christ, Me sitting here, and a Swastika came out like that, also a kind of a Om and there is a little light and Mother Mary. They appear in your vibrations normally, except for Ganesha appeared fully. And have a look of this. So He was there, and this should happen only when it was the birthday of Christ we celebrated.


Also there were other photographs where vibrations came out from my face, but this one was remarkable. And one photograph has come in the sky of My feet. You see, My feet have a little equal to a roundish angle, and in fact there is the photograph of Christ and also of Shiva,  but you turn it around. It looks like the one William Blake has made of the sun exactly. So clear-cut isn't it? Absolutely.


One photograph has come out recently with a complete – My face is very small like that, and a complete chakra, complete, huge big light. I mean, such a strong light starting from here like that Shri Chakra complete. The face is so small and the thing is so big, tremendous light. And another one has somehow lots of My hands and things and also the, what you call, the weapons. One of them is the stick of the guru also there hanging in the air. Gave Me a hunter. Also gave Me a stick, you see. That is seen so clearly. It's in the sky hanging there. These photographs are something. Only some people get it as you said that there is a gap of time because there is a photograph of this Ganesha standing behind Me. So many have taken photographs. Only one boy got it at the most, and another one got it partly because I think it was out of focus. One got the full and one got the part of it.


[A Sahaja Yogi comments something just like the famous series and the rays of light]


Last Sahastrara Puja photographs also were very remarkable. That suddenly the lights, where there were lights, you see, but suddenly new lights appeared and the lights started taking forms. So the first form and from the light there were some small little string-like lights going, and the lights first wrote ‘Allaa’. It was the second, they wrote My name of Mine from the other side, and they were as if on to these little strings.


All kinds of things. All things are done by Shiva, I think, trying to convince you. And the horoscope they gave to a very famous man called Bhandari in Delhi. He has come out with such things that you won't believe, rather extraordinary. I mean, it's horrible. He said that all these people – he has made the horoscopes of all the Incarnations right from Rama, Krishna, Christ and all. He said they were all “anshaj” – [asks for English word for “anshaj” from a Sahaja Yogi – he prompts as “part”] – part. They are a little part, but I am a total, according to the – and he is a very famous astrologer. So I told him, “You just have to keep quiet.”


I will have some tea, wanted to bring some tea but I thought, these Customs. He removed everything, will show you with all the things how he sat down and removed everything. They were offering Me that, “Please have some dinner. “I said, “No, no, I'm not going to have any dinner.”


…the whole thing was absolutely


It started here from the very beginning. You see, it’s full of vibrations. But you see, I don’t know what is the law in America; I don’t know. Do they allow you to use the flag? But you see, these Indians don’t touch the food, but Americans are  more sensitive. Food-wise they are not very good, but other things they know. If you see the list of things, you’ll be shocked. Nothing of, nothing of this, nothing of that, dead or alive.


No, but the other day I was reading an article and also a book I read  that there is no parasite which does not, that does not exist in Australia. All types of worms, you know, this time, like booze, are nowhere in the world. I think Australians [are to be fed? ought to be scared? unclear]


I knew that it would happen, but with a little authority you have, people go off. They can't bear. They don’t have that much capacity to bear, because if they want they can send it to India. See, why not send it to Russia as a measure of courtesy and democracy? Never think about these things – demonocracy, yes.


What is the party here now?


Sahaja Yogi: Labor Party.


Shri Mataji: Labor Party is there is ?


Sahaja Yogi: Not a traditional labor party.


Shri Mataji: It’s hypocrisy they are not labors. That’s what I was telling you, that the English still have maintained certain standards.


Sahaja Yogi: The Labor Party here is more liberal than the Liberal Party. 


Shri Mataji: Which is the other party – Labor and what else?


Sahaja Yogi: Liberal, agricultural side.


Shri Mataji: The so-called Labor; that’s why.


Sahaja Yogi: It’s a very strange Labor Party because the traditional areas in the community which Labor looks after, they haven’t done anything for them at all. In fact, they make life difficult for them.


Shree Mataji: Actually they are, basically I think Australians are farmers. They are farmers. So there should be a farmer’s party, much better, and a Labor Party. Everywhere there is exploitation. In the name of politics everywhere there is exploitation. But actually, if you have very good bureaucracy in Chennai, but if the bureaucracy is also corrupt everywhere. Many people have been asking Me whether they should join any party and stand for election. I said, “Election you forget. You can join any party you like.  I have seen that Sahaja Yoga doesn’t enter into politics because you have to become, because, you see, this is how they are effective because they are there. Good people have to be in the politics. Otherwise, all this kind of mafia everywhere.


Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, if good people go into politics, they don’t remain good.


Shree Mataji: I think they are all good people, because my father was in the politics. First he sacrificed a lot for the country. Then he became the member of the Constituent Assembly of the Constitution, then of the Parliament. He was for the Central Assembly, then the Constituent Assembly, then the Parliament. They were very different type of people, so concerned, so much worried of. In Constitution they made sitting down and arguing and trying to find out. They made our Constitution for England. They called for England. But once that generation has gone, all these devils have come up, one better than the other. So the value system is so shattered in India, so shattered that unbelievable. It is shattered unbelievably.


My husband was collector long time back. We never even heard, I mean, it never even came on our ears anywhere that the collector could be corrupt. No question. Even deputy collector won't be. But now not only the collector, the Commissioner, the Minister, the Prime Minister, everybody is corrupt, openly.


This time when they appointed the Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar, there were sixty people who were to be won over. So this Sharad Pawar went with the money, and each person was given one crore of rupees. So it comes to hundred thousand. All right, then this Rajiv Gandhi who supported this Chandra Shekhar, this is very interesting, so people got after Sharad Pawar that he is against Rajiv Gandhi he should be thrown out. And they Rajiv Gandhi said, “All right, whatever the high command says, we'll have.”  This is very interesting how things worked out. They said it is Rajiv Gandhi who started joke and then when he came to the end of it, he said Sharad Pawar said, not Rajiv Gandhi says, “I will not worry of that high command.” They said that Rajiv Gandhi took hundred crores, hundred crores of rupees from Sharad Pawar to maintain his seat as Chief Minister. And the whole thing fizzled out, you see, all this high command and all that, and this fellow is still there. To maintain his seat he paid hundred crore. Now from where does that money come? Only from Maharashtra, and why will they remove poverty? Also because they can purchase the person for five rupees each, so why will they do? It’s logic.


There is no concern. There is no feeling, nothing. There is a very funny type of politics when you don’t have any concern.


Sahaja Yogi: The politics of money.


Shri Mataji:  Yeah, but if in Sahaja Yoga also we have that kind of thing, then we cannot say of mishap some of them are there. There also I find there is no concern – very selfish, self-centered. They come to Sahaja Yoga all right for their own emancipation, and then suddenly they slip off.


Even Warren is suffering from some horrible disease. His wife has written to Me. I said, “All right. Later we will talk.”


I am sorry for this, what happened last time with his girlfriend (with his girl?) but we all had to pay for it.


Sahaja Yogi: Sahaya Yoga got rid of before we got there.


Shri Mataji: Yeah, he said, “You give me yours. You give me yours.” We gave. Then he said, “Walk right through.” So we said, “We have to walk straight through like where? Here? He looks like this, he looks like that.”


Sahaja Yogi: This is not fair. [unclear- laughter]


Sahaja Yogi: I will never forget coming into Paris last year. Only ivory from America, a big suitcase of Gregoire’s, full of ivory and I thought, “Oh.” Well, I had to carry it because all other people from America were late. The suitcase was full, and I also had some in my own case. So what am I going to say? Because it’s, I mean, it’s prohibited to import, and when I got to Paris there was a strike. I spent a lot of time on the plane saying, “What am I going to say?”


Shri Mataji: They said, “We want to give You something for the Navratri tomorrow.” I said, “Now what?” “A flower pot which looks like kumba.” It was so expensive. I said, “No, no, nothing doing. Get it from India.” Then I went to New York. Suddenly it came to my head, “Let’s go and see ivory. There is where you get ivory. Gregoire was with us. so I just walked, walked, walked. He said, “Where are we going?”  I said, “Come along, come along, come along.” He said, “Do you know this?” I said, “No, I have never been here before.” And I just turned around and I said, “Now it’s here.” And there we got, and he gave us for forty percent less and was so anxious to part with it because nothing was selling. He gave us ivory also very cheap.


So they said, “No, no, this is very much cheaper.” Told them it is much cheaper in London and we are not going to take. He first came. They never brought it. Now what to do? Now Navratri Puja is in Switzerland, now horrible Customs in Switzerland. All these things arrived there. So the Customs said, “What is this?” “All these have got these ivory things in it.” Ivory was supposed not to be imported, you know, closed case  boxes that they have. So they said, “All right, you can remove the cases and see for yourself.” Then they removed the thing, and they saw the whole thing. It was so beautiful. They had glazed statues and they were shocked, you see, and they said, “What now? What now? Take it. Fifty pounds you pay. Take it, the whole thing, for fifty pounds.” To think of it, you know. Not a single pie. I mean, then I give up because I always said [unclear]


So then I went to Greece. They told Me, “Mother, you must get something made of clay for this Ganesha Puja.” So while going on the road from the airport just felt the vibration. I said, “Let’s go round (down?). Something on the other side, maybe.” We went and saw ? you have seen that, oh ho ho – it’s like one piece is sometimes for fifty pounds, hundred pounds, and he was so happy somebody had come to buy that. “Oh, my God, please buy this junk. It has been there for twenty years.” For twenty years – real gold ? and he said, “People nowadays modern don’t like this.” He said, “I’ll give you for forty percent, fifty percent, whatever you say. You take it.” And the original price was something so low twenty years back. He said, “You’ll have to take the whole lot.” I mean, the whole lot was not much in the sense, but the price is. So we purchased that, and then on the way we saw one. We wanted to buy some lamps for the Diwali Puja, for home. So they saw some lamps. So we stopped the car, went inside the shop, and the prices were like 1000, 2000, 3000. We just went around and found out from where it is. It was written the card, “Padua”. Padua is somewhere in there in Italy. So I sent word to someone, to find out where this Padua is.  Can you imagine? He wrote back saying, “Mother, there is puja. There is in Padua. How she knows?” Have you seen those – My tremendous thing, you know, and that gentleman was so happy with these guys.  I was surprised why he's so happy that we're here. Of course, it's a very expensive thing. He said, “You see, my, all my things were going to Riyadh and to Kuwait, but now because of war we are stranded, and you take.”


So then I start now, you see, I don't know. I said, “Now, I'm not going to select anything for Me. No presents,” but doesn't you see how it explains?  Last but not the least is this Shiva Puja. I said, ”Now you give Me everything. Shiva doesn't need anything. You don't give to Shiva this, that.” “Mother, we'll not, I, we'll do this.” I said, “All right. Let's go and buy some paintings.” So we went to, there was a small little painting, a serious thing how vibrations were. A small little round painting. They said 120 pounds. I said, “Wah wah, such a little painting, and that is 120 pounds.” I said, “Nothing doing. Nobody is going to give Me any painting. You can give Me paints at the most.” He said, “There's a factory. Let's go there.” So I asked him, “You don’t have any more paintings?” He said, “No, we have paintings.”  We went upstairs to see the paintings. Same thing was for two pounds. Can you believe it? For two pounds, same thing. So then he said, “Mother, now this is too much.” Two pounds, which country will give for two pounds? I said, “Why are you bent upon spending more money?” He said, “No, Mother, two pounds. Which country will give two pounds?” I was also wondering. Nobody will give like that. I said, “It’s all right;  compromise. You like something better, no one nice painting I like.” He said, “You see, this is nothing, my brother. This is the copy of the antique. My brother has a complete antique shop within London. Would you like to buy that?”  We said, “Why not?”  Went down. Really, if you see those paintings you won't believe. All those painting we bought for, I think, about seven, eight thousand, all of them, and one of them will cost you nothing short of sixteen thousand in London, even one. No wonder they were so cheap. They said, “Now, Mother, what do you say?”  I said, “Baba, I give up”. From one shop to the other he directed us. Such beautiful, all beautiful things, one better than the other. I mean, somehow or the other, luckily for ourselves it worked out. Then you have to keep quiet about it.


Now we, I told Hugo that I said every time we come we have to go to the Embassy. He said, "Mother, why not we try for [unclear]?” They got it. So we said, “Now we must have a house.” So he said, “All right, we’ll find out." When I went there, what do I find? A big, huge castle. “Mother, for the amount you said, this castle is available. Are you interested?” I said, “Of course. I mean, it’s much better to have a castle. Anybody can come and stay. We can have puja.” So we are now buying a castle there. I was thinking for a four-bedroom house that will come with that amount, and here is a huge, huge big castle with all kinds of land and everything. Unbelievable, I tell you.


[Unclear – laughter]


But, you see, you must know at least they have much money, but we never had. It’s all worked out. If you have too much money also, that’s a headache and people get confused. It’s better to have as much as you need, not too much, because ours is not a big house. And God provides you with whatever you want. Look at these things happen. I know this is one of the, these things are very low material level. The way people describe, the way they get things worked out, and so I told Phil, “I'm fed up of listening from everyone. Why don’t you make a book?” So he said, “Both the sides I have got the papers up to my head like this. Now see, Mother, what to write I have no …..”


So, I mean, in every way people are helped. In education so many of our students have got first class first. Children have got first class first. I mean, just see. It’s amazing how they are passing, and I asked them, how do they manage? “Mother, whatever we read came in the exam, exactly the same.” So you see, the whole, this working is coming from this Parambrahma. This is become totally ? you see in the interval between the Kalyuga and the Satyuga, there is an interval, and in that interval it becomes active. But this time it has become so active from every angle, whatever you say, it happens whatever is said. Only thing is that sometimes if somebody troubles Me, then it is a pity. That’s what I am worried about.


So, you see, everything is working out. Just see two days before you get the house. How do you get? It’s a very common occurrence, very common. He was telling Me, “Mother, we don’t have a [unclear]. He said, “Mother there is big problems with a man who is a …


[Side remarks about lunch items; Marathi and English mixed]


So I told Hugo, “Try to keep a watch on the advertisement.” When I went there he told Me, “Mother, there are two houses have been advertised, and see that one and see that, and if you say yes then we'll buy.” I said, “But I am going away to Rome tomorrow. Tomorrow is our flight.” So he said, “Then later on we will see,” and all that. And the flight was cancelled and they said, “You can go the next day.” I said, “Hugo, this is the chance. Let us go and see the ashrams.” And I got the second day flight and went. In one day we bought such a big place. There are two big ashrams and two small houses and there is lot of land.


This time I have to make one humble request that don’t take too many things and don’t get ? because this time when I went to Delhi they all got into the mood of cooking for Me, and every day they cooked sixty-four dishes, nothing short of fifty-six. Sixty-four or fifty-six dishes both the times, and I was with Sadhana, and Sadhana said, “Table is not enough. Let us put it on the carpet.” And I had put on more than twelve pounds. I told these Delhi wallas, “You make sandwiches. The next time if you are going to cook anything, I am not coming.” They all got a fright. And the amount they would put in the, “Specially I got it for you.  I brought it for you.” I said, “Baba-re-babe.” With such love and with such affection. So I had to please them, and in that there is too much really. How many eggs? Only two, huh? 


So did you tell them that this time we are going to start our tour from Madras, not from Bombay? From Madras, then we are going to Bangalore. You have not seen Madras. It’s a very interesting place, very artistic, beautiful place there, and the memory places are also very nice – beautiful temples. This kanjivaram silk sari is made from a temple there called Kanjipuram. Then from there we are going to Bangalore. That’s another interesting place. And from Bangalore we are going to go to Hyderabad. It has a very famous museum, Saala-re- jung, where this little chair of a doll and a chair for an elephant, all are there. So it’s another interesting place, Hyderabad. From Hyderabad we go to Pune, Pune to Kohlapur and then to Ganapatipule, and all this journey now we are not going to go by that horrible buses, those horrible buses and those horrible roads. We will go by train. If you all like you can go trekking.


Rajesh told Me, “Get them, Mother, luxury buses.” So I told Vidoo and Spiro. I said, “Now Rajesh is saying, ‘You get them luxury buses.’ We should get rid of the buses.” They said, “No, no, no, we just want those buses. You will miss the Maharashtra roads. And you enter into any place, they say, ‘We welcome you with great love’. Whole body is completely finished with the amount of jostling we have to go through and then they say, ‘We welcome you’!”


This pottery you have here? This pottery is from here, Australia.  Australians don't make this kind any more, isn't it? More abstract? I was telling him that I have heard that your art is very much exported, and it has gone seventy-two percent more now – export of your art to America, to Japan and to Germany. You know that? Good idea.


Nowadays they are busy rebuilding Kuwait and also rebuilding this Saddam's place Iraq, and that’s how they are borrowing lots of money from all over the world. So they said, “They will be paying lots of interest rates to people. I have to put money in the bank.” I said, “Who has got the money in the bank nowadays?” It's such, such a destruction, horrible. I had said it in my lecture, if you remember. This was that now the only problem is fundamentalism and fanaticism. No political problem because of Gorbachev; only fundamentalism is there [unclear] and suddenly Mr. Saddam, you know, came up out rightly calculating. He thought these people might have passed a resolution at the most.


Sahaja Yogi: [unclear] A lot of people had to end up fighting him were the people who were selling him the arms.


Shri Mataji: That’s the best part. They all Germans, you see, French, English, Americans. But Americans, that's the best part of it that the Americans gave them Naval head. It's actually used it against American Navy, and the bunker he made was done by the Germans, and Germans said, “We cannot catch him because we made this [unclear].” Such stupid people. I mean, when you see all this you just think how much wiser we are, and sane people, compared to them. One better than the other. English also. Why did they think? Anybody could see why do they need all these things from every country. Why didn't they think?


Sahaja Yogi: The big question is why the Saddam Hussain need the fourth largest Army in the world? Who is he protecting himself from?


Shri Mataji: Why did they think?


Sahaja Yogi:  Money.


Shr Mataji: Money is the thing that closes their eyes, just close their eyes. There is no wisdom of these people. First of all, why to make so many weapons in the tanks [unclear], why to produce all these things ? that’s one thing ? and then to sell it to somebody like Mr. Saddam as if he was a great sort of a exponent or some sort of Greek God or something. He was the one who had killed so many people beforehand with chemical weapons. Why to give to such an indiscreet person? You see, in this world people who are really, absolutely cruel and Rakshi type of people who are at the helm of affairs, and we Sahaja Yogis have to learn now that we are people something much above them. We never heard this news in India, you know, that Saddam is killing his own people. Did you hear that in India? You never heard it, huh? We never heard it.


Sahaja Yogi: When he first came to power he killed six hundred people, political people of the country that could have been a threat.


Shree Mataji: Every time you find a new type of a personality, we have to now worry. We have to concern ourselves, as people who are speaking of emancipation of human beings, that such people are coming up, and there is always a danger anybody can come up like that.


He was buying some big channel that time they stopped, that time it came into their head they caught him. That means he must have been planning all these things for long. [Marathi]


[Sahaja Yogi talks about immigration problems [unclear]]


Shri Mataji:  Show them the bangles. This was given to Me in the puja, you see, 'shankha'. This is what you call shell. Tomorrow they might say take off your teeth because it’s made of hair brush, not able to decide whether it is wooden or not – thought if it was wooden then we are finished. What a joke it is [unclear] Sandalwood is all right? We had sandalwood oil, but that also you got it there?


Sahaja Yogi: … “Have you been on a farm?” And he had a pair of shoes. “Have you got the shoes which you were wearing when you were on the farm?” “Yes, yes, I got it in a plastic bag.” They were looking [unclear].


Shri Mataji: But you know I did that exactly. I kept this packet. I don’t know what it is. That’s why I can’t say what it is. Now I leave it to you to open and see for yourself what it is. So he gave Me at the airport, “This is for the puja, Mother. I don’t know what it is. So you open.” Then he opens and there are some sticks there.


But how is it sandalwood they don’t say?


Sahaja Yogi: Probably sandalwood does not have any infection in it.


Shri Mataji: Not all the woods have. So many like rosewood doesn’t have. Then ebony doesn’t have. Also what you call the Burma sticks we call doesn't have. Also the chinaar never has. Then birth, birch doesn’t have. There is another tree, is the one called Jojoba, never has. It has oil in it. Doesn't have, and olive oil, some olive thing it does not have. I mean, anything eucalyptus oil comes from there. You see, another one we have in India that also doesn’t have. So except for very few, must be the ones which we call as the raw ones, like maybe mango, maybe mango, because it doesn’t have any oil in it. But even the Neem has oil. Neem has such a qualities you don’t know. It is such a good thing for the skin. I cured a burn in three days – completely cleared out. Hands, face everything. He says, “Mother, such a miraculous thing,” and he knows about it – three days and he had it for years. But I said this only grows in India. You see nowhere else.


Sahaja Yogi: I heard the other day that there is one of the people in Australia tried to bring Neem to grow Neem here.


Shri Mataji: Why not? If you vibrate it you can. You can grow anything anywhere. Now I am growing olives in my Pratishthan. They said, “You cannot grow tulips.” Tulips are there, everything. Whatever I said, everything is growing in Prathisthan. But this Neem, how can they send you this?


Sahaja Yogi: It was a commercial thing actually – it was the [unclear].


Shri Mataji: Yeah, any number. They grow very fast. They are absolutely very easy to grow. But I don't know. So why not you people ask permission to grow Neem tree?


[Marathi]


In Shirdi, SaiNath used to sit under the Neem tree. So half of the tree has got absolutely sweet leaves. They are never sweet. They are very bitter. That's a good idea. Even to bring geru, it was so difficult. So I didn’t bring any geru. But you can't bring geru as a medicine, can't you? As an Ayurvedic medicine? But in Italy it is so. Even in England, only Australia, but America doesn’t have any wood business.

Shri Mataji: Reptiles, crocodiles, I mean, who is going to bring them alive here? Reptiles, dead or alive. You don't have snakes, do you? You have, you have cobras. Then you should bring some cobras. They can't be that venomous. Achcha! Spiders? They are scorpions or spiders? [Marathi]


Sahaja Yogi: Spiders are really harmful to children.


Shree Mataji: And bees. What about  bees? Are there in Austria, Africa? You have them here? There's a sort of a, it bites. Visitor fly or something. You don't have? Thank God.


Sahaja Yogi: We seem to have one very dangerous species– an octopus, very small, and you find it on the beach.


Shri Mataji: Octopus cause bleeding? My God!


Sahaja Yogi: And sea snakes.


Shri Mataji:  They don’t bite….


Sahaja Yogi: Only in October.


Shree Mataji: Achcha! It’s surprising in India; these things do not harm you at all. You can bring any amount of goods. Anything you bring to India. I mean, the way you walk through the Customs, as long as you are on the back and even if somebody comes alone. This time I landed in Delhi and I had a dinner set which I bought for my daughter. Oh, poor thing, she doesn't have any dinner set, and all my dinner sets are packed up in Prathisthan. So I thought she should have one, because if anybody coming to her house for dinner. She wanted something like a very big … So we bought that, put it on the plane, because already have a very heavy weight, they say. So they put it on the plane. So we arrived in Delhi. And who came with Me I don’t know. 


So there is one Mr. Dutta who comes to the – he must have received you also when you went to Delhi. He was supposed to be there. So we carried that heavy stuff outside. Still we're waiting for Mr. Dutta to come to receive. So I went down to see if Mr. Dutta was anywhere. So I said, “Now this is going to be troublesome, because if the Customs, they get into their heads, they'll get after you. They will make you open everything and all that.” Suddenly one gentleman came and touched my feet. I said, “Who are you”? He said, “I am a Customs officer.” I said, “Now see, I have got one dinner set and I have some.” “So what, Mother? We are all your servants. I am not yours. What is that Dutta is the only one you can go – and what about us? Why not give us some punyas?” I said, “Look at this one.” Started looking at him. I said, “All right, there are some things kept there.” He  went  and brought it. Then he said, “I have to make humble request.” I said, “What?”  “My boss is sitting in the office. He wants to meet you.” I said, “For what”? Very anxiously. He said he had come back. “All right, let's go and see the boss.”


The boss says that, “I am sorry I have called you. I should not have one that it is not proper, but I want to have my realization.” ? Custom boss. So I said, “Now there's no question of being worried about this Customs.” So I gave him realization. Now he has joined Sahaja Yoga. That's how we are now out of trouble when we are in Delhi. Bombay is out of question. We don't have any trouble with Bombay. First of all, you see, I saw one man came and said, “Too many standing on one side.”That surprised Me first of all, and he was the one standing there again, you see, the way he said, “Now where is that? What is that?”  Oh, that declaration. Then I gave one, and I thought, “Now he's going to say, ‘Now just go ahead that side. That sardarji is there. Now you walk right through.’” I said, “Why?” Then he tells Me that, “Mother,” he is saying, “You walk through that exit.”   I said, “Are you sure?” See, I was wondering, you see, this side, that side, and how we really walked through three of us. But he was saying all the way, “This time there won’t be anything.” But from the very beginning he has that, you see. He came and told us, “Stand here.” Customs are Customs.

These are all from the puja of Ram Navami. They said Rama was born at 12 o’clock. So we should not finish the puja before 12 o’clock. I said, “Very nice. Tomorrow I have to fly out.” Puja is something, I must say. They all came. All the foreigners who were in Delhi came all the way to Calcutta. They came from all around – from Bihar, from Orissa and from Assam, from Delhi, from everywhere, from Madras, for this puja. Poor things, they worked very hard, you know, and they were extremely generous. Anybody suffering from anything, they will first catch it,  take it out. Nobody has given us permission to do that. 


So now what should I say? Good morning, good night, whatever. I think I better sleep for a while.
