[12:56]

Finchley, the  28th of October 1977. Questions and discourses after the first Caxton Hall lecture, 24th October 1977.

Man 1: I was lying on the bed [Unclear], I couldn’t see anything. I was fighting with someone  on the bed.  I was totally  freed off when  I was fighting to [Unclear, get away from him]. But at the same time, I had to hold on  him. So  he couldn’t get away from me. And then [Unclear, there came] a flash of light through the window. It was a [Unclear, violent] flash of light and I saw the other person on the bed, and it was me.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]

Man 2: He was fighting with himself.

Shri Mataji: Oh, you saw the face and it was you?

Man 1: I did not see the face, but I knew it was me.

Shri Mataji: That’s what it is. Then I [Unclear the spirit].

Man 1: It was a very powerful  feeling .

[14:16]

Shri Mataji: What’s your name?

Woman 1:  Danielle . [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: You are an Indian?

Woman 1: No, I come from Mauritius. [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: Yes. Lots of Indians there.

[14:47]

Shri Mataji: Did you feel any vibrations, Danielle? [Unclear  got there]?

Woman 1: O,  yes, I did.  I felt cold in [unclear, very hot]

[Indistinct conversation]

[15:10]

Shri Mataji: You see, how it comes  at the [Unclear being].  You are condemned in your childhood, many a times. And then you developed, sort of get separated  by the/your spiritual. And you also start, one part starts condemning the other part. Actually, it’s really you are becoming [Unclear with two hearts] [Unclear]. It becomes  two personalities.

I feel that the more people are advancing in  their countries, the worse they are with their own children.  [unclear, becoming very unnatural, very unnatural/unhappy. This kind of development is no good. I mean   a child supposing, he spoils the carpet, then he, [unclear]   the child becomes [Unclear, unimportant]. Very unimportant in  the family. The only thing he  has to [unclear] .

[17:00] (Shri Mataji is working on yogis)

Shri Mataji: HA! .... [unclear], very good... (Shri Mataji is laughing). Now see for yourself. An Australian wasting my time for nothing at all!  I’m going to  blame  you for that.

(Shri Mataji is laughing). You have to tell him, why are you wasting Mataji’s time for nothing at all? Just see the psychology of the person! You get somehow some book [unclear] you have to know him, you try to ask Me! Something sensible. What’s the use of wasting My time, or your time?HA! [unclear] but still you - that’s how you fight your possession. Now, don’t feel bad about anything. (Shri Mataji is laughing) [unclear, getting] fun is so great. Now, will you please forget it? Now what I [unclear] I have done it automatically because you [unclear] alright? I’m happy you told Me that. You never do anything like that again. You must tell Me beforehand because there is nothing wrong, I’m your Mother, after all, you have to tell Me. [unclear] look after you. (Shri Mataji is laughing)

[18:15]

[Preparations for the workshop, probably going on]

(Shri Mataji is working on yogis, it is unclear what they are talking about. She is laughing and joking, and music is playing)

....

Shri Mataji: Put your hands like this. (after some time) there is ... warm One hand towards Me. ... I will tell you what it is like. (somebody came in) Hello! How are you now? ... better?

Shri Mataji! It’s alright, it’s alright. Put your hands like that.... [unclear]

[42:20 ]

[Mantras being chanted]

OM Twameva Sakshat, Shri Saraswati Brahmadeva Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati Sakshat, Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namah

Shri Mataji: ...OM Twameva Sakshat Brahmadeva Saraswati...

[44:00]

[Shri Ma Jagdamba’s name spoken many times]

[45:00]

Man 2: You know,  today as I was looking at the picture   the mind was still . The mind was still, but ... I forgave the  demons  of my mind. [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: You better [Unclear  could/should find them out]

Man 2: All I keep [Unclear] ... many thousand ... [unclear] can I help?

Shri Mataji: Now I hope you throw away  all the books  that you have   [unclear] with them. Alright? They  only make you argue all these things out. You are not here to represent them in any way, isn’t it? You don’t have their lawyer’s [Unclear certificate]. [Unclear]... get well. That’s important.

Yogini: Much better now.

Shri Mataji: Much less. It’s a waste of time. For you, for others, for everyone. Alright? HA! I would say this. ... Put your hands. HA!  Better now? Absolute waste of time.

Man 2:  Must be.  [Unclear]

(laughter)

Shri Mataji: Now, you just think it like that . Now see, how it will work? if  somebody  else do that? [unclear, rational person] Alright?   [Unclear] Why should I? What is the need? She knows everything, she knows. What’s the use of asking? (?But it is the past thing). Nothing important. What is important is how much am I going to know about it. How much I’m going to achieve  is the point. Even if there may be something, what's  the use? What are they doing? Nothing. Now, you have to think. You have to achieve something, isn’t it? You are not here for glorifying them, you are here for glorifying yourself.  Look after  yourself.  That’s not  being very constructive about yourself. If you  worry  about others, you see, what’s the use of  glorifying  them? Isn’t it? HA! Just see now.

Shri Mataji: See,  when you read them, you have  them also  in your head. It’s very difficult.

Man 2: Yes, there’s plenty of books in my head. .

Shri Mataji: There’s a crowd of there.

Man 2: Too many.

Shri Mataji: You see ... there. You are nowhere. You are lost in the crowd's  That’s the point. (Shri Mataji is laughing.

Shri Mataji: Sit down there. Now, you put your feet in the water in front of Me. . [Unclear]

Man 2: The candles were black all the time. Always black.

Shri Mataji is laughing: [unclear] So now you will know what I am saying. It’s true, there’s a lot of dread/death  these people  have put into it, it’s true. Do you see? But if you think how things ... it will go  [Unclear soot]. Don’t you worry! I am achieving it ...  If it opens up, the soot will go.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] ... as I am is concerned, she is alright. [unclear] Agnya?

Sahaja yogi: ...yes, it’s not heavy in the hand.

Another Sahaja yogi: ... Vishuddhi

Shri Mataji: Vishuddhi’s bad because take the mantras, you see? On the right-hand side. On the right-hand side is much worse because [unclear] mantras.

(the workshop is going on, Shri Mataji and the yogis are working continuously on the subtle system)

[50:00]

Shri Mataji: Hm! Better?  Don’t get up. You are sitting in a [unclear]. The only thing [Unclear]. You see,  in the beginning it happens like that. Gradually  you will settle down, don’t you worry. It’s alright. After all, you met Me only the other day, isn’t it? And all these horrid people you’ve had for years together. Bad company [unckear], it’s not easy.  They are not going to leave you alone very easily. They’ll go away. Once they realise that you don’t want them anymore.

Shri Mataji: But I must say your  wife  is having a bad [unclear, a name] is having a bad problem with her. Because of you whatever is happening to her, she refuses to accept that. Because she [Unclear] in [Unclear trance]. It’s a serious thing. Very bad. You must [unclear]

Man 2: She’s not my wife,  it’s my girlfriend.

Shri Mataji: It’s just the same for  Me.

Men 2: Yes, I know. [unclear]

Shri Mataji: You shouldn’t have these things at all. You  should have a wife only.  That is not a good thing, a girlfriend and a boyfriend, and this is all [Unclear]. [Unclear] you realised? [Unclear, God]. Otherwise,  He gets angry,  [unclear, you don’t know]

Shri Mataji: Better? [Unclear] Ganesha is like that. If He gets angry, then [Unclear].

Man 3: [Unclear When/The thing] you were saying in the car was very [Unclear]. About the animals and the human beings. [Unclear How] their attention must be concentrated.

Shri Mataji: Animals? In the car?

Man 3: Yes, in the car, you were saying that heavy animals have sex. In human beings, it has to be more.

Shri Mataji: More sort of, yes. [unclear] Human attention has to be more concentrated, no doubt. Sanctified. Because he has the awareness of what is bad and what isn’t. For an animal, there is nothing like sanctity. It doesn’t think of dharma, it doesn’t think of sanctity. It has dharma. It is bound by it. For, a dog doesn’t become a cat. That’s the point. It’s bound by it, so it need not know about it. But man is taken away from it,  you see it is [Unclear].

[53:25]

Shri Mataji: [The] Best way to  fight out this thing is non-acceptance. Just don’t accept. As she said. You know otherwise these horrible, these [Unclear] people. [Unclear ] I cannot give them realization. But she said, she couldn’t go further, finished. At that point, [Unclear is all].

Shri Mataji:  If you say, we’ll have nothing to do, get out. Then they get out.  [unclear] some of them are  horrible,  they are most [Unclear]. But most of them get out. Because they think they have not [unclear]  with the  person who  doesn’t accept it. So they get out.

(the workshop is going on with music playing)

***[1:02:15]

Shri Mataji: Better now? This you do at home also before  My photograph, alright? Just put  My photograph, you have got the photograph with you? Alright. Put both the hands towards  the photograph and your feet just like this. And there is a mantra written also there. Take that mantra. [unclear]

Shri Mataji: How are you now?

Woman 1: It’s in Sanskrit.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] has to work faster. [Indistinct conversation].

Shri Mataji: What happened? She’s coming?

Woman 1: No. She’s not.

Shri Mataji: When will she?

Woman 1: I don’t know. She was going to the country. She never stops [Unclear  to do anything.

Shri Mataji: What is she doing in the country?

Woman 1: She’s gonna go there and rest. I’ll keep asking her to not do quite so much. Because she’s always exhausted, so she doesn’t have time to [Unclear anything].

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] See what’s the use. [unclear] She will be alright. But you see,  we cannot force we cannot make them [unclear] force them, they have to come themselves.

Woman 1: I’m just worried that she’s gonna tiered herself too much.

Shri Mataji: Don’t worry about her, you see?  Just give a bandhan. What to do now? [Unclear]. You see,  these people, they don’t understand. What to do? [Unclear] talk about  God,  how can you ask? [unclear]. They have to come themselves. They have to ask for it. Then only they  can get it. .

[1:05:00]

[Unclear conversation]

[1:06:00]

Shri Mataji eats chickpeas: For  liver,  this is a very good thing. This  has protein. And protein [Unclear] and you can live on this.

Yogi: ... chickpeas.

[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear], and sugar. The doctors don’t know, that the sugar is the fruit of  liver, isn't it?

Man 3: When somebody has serious hepatitis, they put him on a glucose [Unclear drip]. So, [Unclear]   enough food  they can’t eat anyway, and then they put him on a pure glucose [Unclear drip].

Shri Mataji: That’s true. But the way they become eccentric about things [Unclear]. For example, everyone they will ask to thin down. It’s a wrong idea. ... too thin. You shouldn’t have fat, you shouldn’t have this. It’s very wrong.

[unclear]... (somebody came in)

[1:07:00]

Shri Mataji: And, the other idea they give is, I don’t know if the doctors [Unclear give it], this  tanning  business. This is very wrong. Because  too much of  sun is taken on the body, you get skin troubles, [and] then you will get skin cancer. Brain [Unclear biliousness], you know, everything. Too much of  right-hand side . Too much sun is not good, as too much moon is not good. If you have too much of moon, you might get mad, lunatic. In the same way, too much of sun is not good. And this is what they don’t guide  you against. And here  women  are  crazy  the way they are  mad . [On] one side they will say that we are racist. We don’t believe in black colour. . And here they will be made [Unclear].

[Indistinct conversation]

(Shri Mataji is working on people)

Somebody comes in.

Shri Mataji: Hello! [unclear]. How are you? Come along, sit down. Now, how is it? You didn’t lose it after that, did you?

Shri Mataji, after some time: How is the Agnya?

Yogi: right Agnya is burning [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Right? You just sit here. In front, watch My hand, sit down here. Why are you put the [unclear], (newcomer sad something and Shri Mataji is laughing, the yogi is laughing too). That’s funny. Put it in [unclear, the hand]. Sorry, come along. Sit here. Put your hands towards Me. Feel you something? [unclear, could I have some tea?]

Shri Mataji: You drink? Do you drink?

Man: Ya.

Shri Mataji: You better ask him [unclear, Warren] how [unclear] drunk in the [unclear], never feel like [unclear, drinking] alright? Whenever you feel angry, keep [unclear]. I’m going to give you such a [unclear, state] that you will never get out of that [unclear]. Alright?

(Music is playing, Jai Deva, Jai Deva, Jai Mangala Murti....)

Shri Mataji: Left heart. How is your mother? Where is she?

Shri Mataji to someone who just came in: Hello! How are you? Every day, he is looking better and better, isn’t he? And his face is becoming more sort of [unclear]. How is it/he? [unclear] caught up? [unclear] everybody [unclear] now work on him. Now you all work on people, then only work [unclear, on yourself]. Come along and sit down here. Let them, three of them work, come along, let’s see [unclear] take of [unclear] will be better, sit comfortable, alright? And they’ll look after you with all love and everything.

Shri Mataji, still works on that man: Better now? [unclear] very cruel parents, [unclear] terrible. ... [unclear, same with] father [unclear, same with] mother.

(unclear conversation)

Shri Mataji: [unclear, how are you?] you should come here. And the Kundalini [unclear]. Better now? Falling down [unclear, the Kundalini]?

Man: [unclear, lost]

Shri Mataji: Lost it? I mean, it pierced through. (after some time) It has! (he’s got his Realization)(Shri Mataji is laughing :)))). You got it. Pierced! [unclear, feel] nice! [unclear, he is] in the top of the world now! Put a bandhan, put a bandhan on him, he is got it! )(Shri Mataji is laughing), he is lost it, [unclear, when he asks] the Kundalini suddenly pierced [unclear] that’s the point. You should know [unclear] Mooladhara, there, or it is out.

[1:31:30]

Woman: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: You yourself will be doing all these  [Unclear, less Me]. All of you have to do it. Alright? You all have to use your hands, feet,  brains, heart, everything. You too. Everyone has to. First of all you get well and then you have to do this work.  Alright? Put your legs -  if you are uncomfortable, you can put your legs forward. [unclear] like that. Sit comfortably. I told you, I’m your mother in the real sense of the word. You have to take all the liberties with  Me. Alright? Ask questions also. (Shri Mataji is laughing) First of all, you get alright.

[unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: Better now? He has a problem [unclear] that’s the trouble [unclear, hurt you]. (Somebody has a guru) Where did he come from? Where did you see him?

Man: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Hm? What does he say?

[Indistinct conversation]

[1:33:40]

Someone: He’s got a bad heart.

Shri Mataji: He’s a heart patient?

[Indistinct conversation]

[1:34:10]

Shri Mataji: He has a bad heart, he is a heart patient. Next time he comes here, you tell him about  Me. Let him come  down,   I’ll cure his heart and tell him what is the [Unclear]. You see, he should not teach that, better he should not teach wrong.

[Indistinct conversation]

Shri Mataji: He takes money?

[Unclear]

Shri Mataji: [unclear] but he’s not something great. [Unclear] but still his heart  must be alright. [A] terrible  heart he has. He’ll feel better now.  Write  to him – how are you feeling in your heart?

[Indistinct conversation]

Shri Mataji: Not alright?

[unclear]

Shri Mataji: [unclear] I’ll be removing that.

The man says something unclear, above the head...

Shri Mataji: Is the Kundalini. [unclear, yet] the heart is not opened out properly [unclear] he has started, that’s the mistake. Come along [unclear] you see, very wrong! Should not have been done. Nobody should [unclear].

Yogini: (She tells something to a newcomer)

[Indistinct conversation]

[1:36:30]

Shri Mataji: You must ask for forgiveness. And then you should say that I forgive, all those who trespass against me.

Yogini: [Indistinct conversation]

[1:37:10]

Shri Mataji: He is better now?

Yogini: [unclear], he is very good actually, [unclear], attention...]

Shri Mataji: Then he’ll be alright. Because, you know, they come with him because they want to disturb us. Once he decides not to come, they’ll go away.

Shri Mataji: What do you say [unclear, Gavin?]

Yogi: Left heart.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] I will put My Feet there, alright? You don’t mind? [unclear, you will be alright]

Shri Mataji: How is he?

[Indistinct conversation]

Shri Mataji: [unclear] towards the flame, up, up, little bet away [unclear]

Shri Mataji: I think he is an awakened person, no doubt, but he doesn’t know what he is doing. Where does he come from?

Man, woman: South Africa

Shri Mataji: I was there. From which town?

Man: Cape Town

Shri Mataji: That’s a problem with these realized people also. They go on catching you see, they don’t know how to avoid it [unclear, Agnya is] like this. They move [unclear] poor thing what to do? They are people [unclear] no doubt, he is a good man. But the problem is that he deviates, he doesn’t know how to deal with it at all. [unclear]. He doesn’t know. What’s the use of doing all [unclear] isn’t it? You must get it first of all [unclear], you get polluted.

[unclear conversation]

Woman: He seems so gentle.

Shri Mataji: That’s how they have to be. [unclear] very clever! [unclear]. They talk very diplomatically. [unclear]

[unclear conversation]

[1:43:30]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] big scientist from America. [Unclear, they came to India]. And they told  Me, “we have come to meet you specially. Now you teach us how to leave our body and take it to the moon.” So I said, “why? Aren’t you doing it already?” They said, “No, we want to do it [Unclear]” I said, “Why do you want to do it?” They said, “Now, it is very important for us, we have to do it.” I said, “Now if I tell you that it is  all done through  the spirits. The spirits do that. They can [Unclear come in]. And they, if they do it, you  get  separated you  from yourself.  Take it from Me. You’ll become  sort of another person, and they take your  attention [Unclear, there] and you feel you’ve gone to the moon. Would you like to do that?” They said, “Yes, why not?” I said, “Supposing I also tell you, that they will enslave you. And  it will be difficult for you to get out of it. Still,  will you do it?” “Yes, we don’t mind.” I said, “Why so much insistence? Of getting enslavement. You have  fought  for your freedom, and freedom, now  why do you want to be enslaved? By these people taking you to the moon. You’ve got your aeroplanes and things. Why do you want to  do? You’ve already reached there. Why do you want to do it?”

Shri Mataji: So they told me that in Russia, there is  a big parapsychology thing going on. So  we want to compete with them.  When they are doing it, we should also do it. I said, “If they are burning their houses, why do you want to burn your houses  also?” They said, “We don’t mind.” Such fools  becoming big, big,  great big scientists. I asked them who sent you to  Me. I was amazed to see that they came to  Me, of all the  persons  because I am very against all this.

Shri Mataji: So they  told  Me the name of one [Unclear, Patanjali]. And this Patanjali [unclear]. Because this fellow used to get this kind of  experience. He used to get out of his body, go away, then he would come and tell his wife “I saw this nice, and I saw that”. It used to come in the paper, make stage. He even got some [unclear, sign] to show that he went to the sea. And she was so shocked [that] she used to lock the door, and then she brought him to Me.  Of course, he started shaking before Me, [Unclear] and I said, there’s a spirit in you  which is doing  like this . [Unclear] He worked hard, and after one month the spirit left him, and he was alright, he was  normal.

Shri Mataji: So I rang up that Patanjali and I said,  “You are such a  fool , that you sent them to  Me. You were suffering from the disease. Do you want  Me to put the disease into them or what?” So he said, “I told them that you were against it, but they said they want to  see. ” I said, now these three fools ,  send them back. And never send such people to  Me because I have to tell them the truth. Now they came all the way flying to India, you know? Just to get this nonsense. It's  very easy, to move this from here to there. What is wrong, you can use your hands. Why do you want to do it invisibly?

Someone: Curiosity

Shri Mataji: Curiosity, must have some wisdom in it.  You see, curiosity  without wisdom, can be  very dangerous. Must have wisdom. First, you know, what is the interest of God in moving you from here to there? What’s the [Unclear, use]

Shri Mataji: You understand? [Unclear] First thing and first test we must do. What is the interest of God? Supposing we have to ask God something, what are we going to ask? We ask [Unclear supreme]. Because you are asking for something nonsensical, you’re getting all these nonsensical things. Depends on what shop you want to go in. If you have to come to  Me,  and ask for the supreme. I can’t give you this third grade [Unclear]. Alright?

[1:48:00]

Someone: Do you mind me asking what everybody is staring [Unclear]   Any instructions to take me to things ?

Shri Mataji: Here?

Someone: No, [unclear] , particularly what we’re going to [Unclear make/be doing].

Shri Mataji: Alright. Just now, I’m  getting you alright. In the sense that you should feel the vibrations yourself, you should get the realization completely, you should be cured. Once it is done, then I’ll teach you, and you are going to do the same. Because what you’ll be doing, it's  flowing from  Me. [unclear] You just manoeuvre  it. And  you  understand how it flows. In my  next lecture, I’m going to tell you all about the mechanism.  I’m not going to hide anything from you. Nothing. I’m going to tell you everything. But you should be capable of  understanding  it. Once you are developed that capability, gradually I’m going to tell you each and everything . I’m not going to hide anything from you. Take it from  Me. I’ve come here to tell you everything. Everything I will tell you.

Someone: How long have you been [Unclear here]?

Shri Mataji: Four years. Seeking for you people. Can you believe it?

[Indistinct conversation]

[1:50:50]

Shri Mataji: One thing you must know is that by doing anything you cannot get [Unclear in/it]. You have to become [Unclear something]. By doing [unclear] you have to become.

[Indistinct conversation]

[1:55:30]

Shri Mataji: You see, like mushrooms, [Unclear] appear in the rainy season. In this Kali-yuga , all these horrible people have suddenly come. [unclear]

Man: [Unclear what do you see/seek] in the future?

Shri Mataji: Future is going to be [Unclear grand]. Already started!  Already started. By the time, 1980, you will see that you have entered the kingdom of God completely. Already entered. But then you will feel.

Man: [Unclear] all people?

Shri Mataji: [Unclear, ?Not all people] you think  Hitler  should get realization? These all  of them  are of the same style  even worse than him,  worse than him, all these.

Man: All the guru?

Shri Mataji: All these. Most of them. They are not gurus. They’re rakshasas, demons. Satanic [unclear]

Man: Why [Unclear are they like that]?

Shri Mataji: You see,  in their freedom they choose that. Human beings have been given  freedom. Alright? You have to be given freedom because of your evolution. When you are a child, you have  told [Unclear what is good]. When you grow up, then what happens, you can be understanding  what is [Unclear]. Then you are [Unclear, given a] problem to solve. In the same way, the problem of life also [Unclear is needed/ is given to you] to be solved. In that, some of you became asuras, rakshasas.

Man: [Unclear What is that]?

Shri Mataji: Horrible, [unclear] satanic.

Man: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Karma? That’s what I said. That who does the karmas is (?the pure) ego.

Man: Ego is the thing that wants to get out?

Shri Mataji: Ego [Unclear]. Especially  given to you. To try. Like as we try an electrical thing on a battery, separately first, before putting it into the mains, alright?  This ego is to be discarded later.

Man: You don’t seem like you haven’t got an ego.

Shri Mataji: I don’t seem?

Man: I don’t mean to say that [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: But you think I have got ego? I have. I’m the complete ego. When Christ said, “I am the light, I am the path.”, was he egoistical? [Unclear, Because he was]. But I’m not conscious of it. Whatever  I am, that I am.  I have to say that. But I  would say no. , why? Not because I should not, but because I’m very clever. I don’t want to get crucified  [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: I should say that!  I should say much more than that!  Like Krishna has said, “Sarva dharmana parityajya mam ekam saranam”. Give up everything else and come at my feet and surrender. He was egoistical if you say that way, isn’t it? What is there is the fact.  That has to be told. Actually, I’ve never been that way. I should have been much more. That’d be much better. But I thought that it’s wiser, not to go that much. You see, first, you appear like a very simple woman. So, I put an illusion on  Me. Of a very quiet, shy person. [Unclear, so  it was] another illusion. Sometimes behave like an [Unclear, idiot]. So they feel alright. Because your egos are so developed, that I do touch here, there, anywhere you see, suddenly - whooom! [Unclear] come back on  Me. (Shri Mataji is laughing)

Shri Mataji: I’m very clever, that’s the point. [Unclear] these people  will think  that [unclear, they are] humblest possible ever born. Humblest,  [Unclear  not] doing so much [Unclear bad]. [Unclear Maharshi]. You’d think, oh the humblest man, nothing against him, [Unclear very nice]. All drama. [Unclear]

Woman: [Unclear] When I first saw you, on Monday, I thought you’d be quite gentle. But when you started speaking, you were so full of energy. Fantastic. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: I have too much of it. I have been very gentle in my previous lives. Absolutely gentle that people [Unclear, do not know even who I was]. But today that’s not the  time.  Here I have to speak.

Woman: I wish I had so much energy.

Shri Mataji: You will. You will one day. You will have to have that. Yes, you must have. HA!

(... Silence ...)

Shri Mataji: Perfection is still not [unclear, happy] what is it?

(a man laugh)

Shri Mataji: [unclear, somebody is sitting on your head? What’s it/watch it?

Shri Mataji is still working on people: All the super-ego. HA!

Yogi: Left Sahasrara [unclear] opening now.

[Indistinct conversation]

[2:02:40]

Shri Mataji:  You are alright? The same? The hole between ego and superego. I’m going to tell you about that in my lecture, alright? . Let, - all of you, I’m going to tell you where your attention goes,  in between the ego and superego. You start seeing yourself both   that as conditioning  one side and another side hole is [unclear, clouds] . How they have crossed each other, can you see that? That’s why you see on the  left-hand  side, the ego has come up. Right-hand  side is the superego.

Man: Is this something happening to me? Or are you trying to do something to me? While I’m getting stuck in ego or super-ego, I think.

Shri Mataji: No, you must come out from the centres here. You should be baptized, you see? Now the balance is that your ego has covered this side and pushed back, see?  This ego is covering up this way, and I’m trying to push it back a little so that there is a space in between. .

[2:04:00]

Shri Mataji: HA! [unclear] the Kundalini [unclear, rise up]. The  pressure has gone out.
