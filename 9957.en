Public Program: Day 1

Yogi [aside to Shri Mataji]: These people do not understand Dutch.

Shri Mataji: All right. The French, how many are French? Ah, English – how many understand English? [Yogis ask audience in Dutch and French] All right, we could have in three languages. [laughter and applause]

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is. [microphone is adjusted, as Shri Mataji says, laughing: No-one understands English, so what’s the use?] And unfortunately, with this human awareness, we cannot feel the truth. Whatever we have achieved in our evolution, we can feel it. For example, if you take a dog through a dirty, smelling place, he doesn’t feel anything bad. But human beings are different. They have a sense of colour, they have a sense of beauty and they can think for themselves, and also can make implements for themselves. Now whatever I’m going to tell you, you don’t have to believe it with blind faith, but you have to treat it as a hypothesis and if it is proved, you must accept as honest people. Because it is not only for your benevolence, but for the benevolence of the whole world. It is not only for your emancipation, but for the emancipation of the whole world. The truth is that, you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit.

The second truth is that, there is an all-pervading Power of God’s love which does all the living work. We see these flowers are so beautiful and we take them for granted. We don’t even think that, how they have come up from the Mother Earth? So, all things that we don’t know, we take it for granted. Our heartbeat is said to be, according to medical terminology, is done by autonomous nervous system. But who is this ‘auto’? We cannot answer all the questions, because we have not reached at that place where we can find the absolute truth. To find the absolute truth, you have to become a subtler being. All the scriptures have said that, you are to be born again. By just taking a brand that: ‘We are born again,’ we are not. In Sanskrit, a realised soul, or an enlightened soul is called as a dvijaha, as well as a bird is called a dvijaha. Dvijaha means twice born; first the bird is like an egg, then it matures and becomes a bird, and the bird is very different from the egg and it is absolutely free to fly. This is what has to happen: actually. This is the actualisation – your baptism. Just by putting some water, by a person who is not enlightened, you cannot become baptised. You may belong to any religion – you may call yourself, Hindu, Moslem, Christian or anything – you are capable of committing any sin. So we have to humbly understand that there is something missing. Christ has said, ‘Meek in the heart will inherit the earth,’ so we have to be meek in heart and see for ourselves if it works out or not. We have to keep ourselves open, like a scientist.

Now, you must have heard that in India, there were three doctors who got their M.D. – means doctorate – after their graduation, in Sahaja Yoga. They have dealt with subjects like asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, tensions and they have proved, through Sahaja Yoga, you can cure all these diseases very easily. So when this Power, which I call as Kundalini, gets awakened, She passes through your six centres, which are the basics of your being. Thus it nourishes all these centres and integrates, with each other. All world problems are because of human beings, because of their ignorance. And all the problems – which are human – are because of their bad chakras. Like this instrument [microphone] is here and is connected to the mains. Without the connection it has no meaning, it has no purpose. So you have to have your connection with this all-pervading Power.

Now, we have to see what is our situation at this time. In these modern times, there are many people who are born with the faith within themself that, there is something beyond all that we see. This understanding should be there but they do not know how to cope, because they are all the time challenged. The faith is all the time challenged by science of modern times, and then by the religion, though all the religions are absolutely all right; there’s nothing wrong with them. The only problem is, the people who have organised them and the ones who are following are not spirit-oriented. They are either money-oriented or power-oriented. Actually, all the religions came out of very great incarnations and very great prophets, saints and seers. These people, whatever they said, is not followed, because the first thing they have said that: you have to have your Self-Realisation, your self-knowledge. So all the religions think that they are the best. According to Christians, Jews and Muslims are no good as religions. And according to Islam – Islamic people I mean, not the Islam, but Islamic people – Christianity and Jews are their enemies. Hindus also think the same. So as we can say, they all live in their fool’s paradise. And then, they form fundamentalism; they become fundamentalists and fight in the name of God. They make horrible money secretly, in the name of God, they kill people, they create bombs – I mean, they do everything in the name of God. Thus, our faith is challenged. We cannot believe how these people can do these things in the name of God. And then we start feeling defeated; we don’t know how to defend our faith within ourself.

As you know, science is amoral; it is inconclusive. It goes on, solving little problems here and there. It does not attack issues in total. For example, we have one doctor for one eye, another doctor for another eye. [laughter and applause, before translations are given] I think you all understand English, what I say. [more laughter]

Now, with this kind of nonsense going on around us, with ecological problems, with political problems, with economic problems, we don’t know where is this faith. Then we talk of God Almighty, or the Divinity and we can’t understand; how can it be? Because if there is divinity, if there is God, how all these horrible things they are doing in the name of God? The reason is they are ignorant. There is divinity in each person; all of you have got divinity within yourself, specially you people who are seekers, and the seekers are a special category of people. They are the ones who never got any answer, so they have found out their individual methods or individual pursuits of truth. So a market is created and all kinds of fake gurus, false prophets, they are exported everywhere.

From the year 1970, I have been telling about these fake gurus – their... even names. They never talk against each other; they are all combined together. Christ has rightly said that, Satan doesn’t speak against its own house. They are all in the same business, befooling people, mesmerising them, destroying their chakras and making money out of them. I mean there are institutions – yesterday we discovered one lady who had been to some authorised institution for some sort of a psychological analysis. And she paid a lot of money, and what she got is a body which shakes in a very funny way all the time and she cannot stand. This Mr Freud is also another horrible fellow, he was respected more than even Christ, in the West. And they followed him more than they could follow Christ. These are funny intellectuals – they take out some yarn out of their head, write books, even right from, I would say, from Tolstoy even [corrects to ‘Christ’s first disciple’ during Dutch translation. Shri Mataji then refers to Aristotle] – so many people in every country have taken out some sort of a yarn and have impressed people. He has really twisted the whole thing. The worst was, I think that Paul has ruined Christianity. He himself was epileptic and  he had killed a disciple of Christ called Stephen and he was a very cruel bureaucrat: Roman. So he tried to find out the weakest disciple of Christ, who was Peter, and Peter is the one who was told by Christ that, ‘Satan will take over and he’ll deny Me three times.’ These two put together, edited the Bible. They fought with Mathews, Thomas ran away to India, and John would not write his treatises. On his way, Thomas put all his treatises in a big jar and buried them in Egypt. This was discovered only fifty years back and was rather decoded, but it is out now, as I am told, as a book. I had read the articles, of what they have translated, and I was amazed that he's talking of the spiritual experience of Self-Realisation throughout.

But he called the people who got realisation as Gnostics. Gn comes from Sanskrit – gn means knowledge, from which it comes the word gyana; gyana means the knowledge on your central nervous system. But not only reading, Kabira has said that people have become idiotic by reading too much. I had that experience now. [laughs] So it's not learning, it's not a mental process but it is a state. It is a state you have to achieve. At this time it's so important to understand that whatever has been said in the scriptures, we can prove it. As in the Quran, it is written that at the time of Qiyamah, which is a resurrection, your hands will speak and give witness against you. That’s exactly what happens to you; when you get your realisation your fingers, as is shown here, get enlightened. First of all, you feel this all-pervading Power of God's love as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Bible they have described about Trinity – God the Father, God the Son. You have the Father and the Son, but Mother is missing, and not only that but She is made into a dove.

I mean, in Indian culture woman is the power, the shakti. And Holy Ghost is the Power of God, which is the Adi Shakti, the primordial Mother. A woman could be a priest, she could be a philosopher, she could be a guru; she is respected much more than I would say even saints, if she's, she is a shakti. Because She's a Mother, She is the primordial Mother. Also in Greece, they have Athena who was the primordial Mother. Surprisingly ‘atha' means primordial in the Sanskrit language. So many similarities, but then I don't know why, they forgot about it, maybe the way they moulded the idea of primordial Mother. So there are many fundamentalists who hate us, and try to say things which are absolutely false against us. Because we believe in all religions and they cannot stand this truth. And another thing is that we say that you cannot take any money for spiritual work, because it is divine love and you cannot pay for it. They don't like this aspect at all. This is how, but it has been always. Even Thomas had to, I mean, face such horrible times, because the Gnostics were also troubled by clergies; everywhere it happens when the reality comes, all these fundamentalists try to suppress.

But if you are a seeker, you must find the truth. You should not identify yourself with all these things because these are conditionings. You have to seek your Spirit. William Blake* has already prophesised that: ’Men of God will be born at this time and they will become godly and make others also godly.’ So that time has come now. Tomorrow I'll tell you more about the nature of the Spirit. But today I have to tell you one thing that, when this Kundalini pierces through your fontanel area and you get connected to this all-pervading Power, you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand, very gentle, soothing, relaxing. Also, to begin with, you feel the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Maybe you might feel little heat also coming out from your fontanel bone, as if the funnel is open.

So, a new state is established within you to begin with, that you become thoughtlessly aware. So, when you become thoughtlessly aware, you feel the present. You are either in the future or in the past, and our thoughts come to us from either from the future or from the past. And we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts. But if I say, now take your attention inside, you cannot. That's only possible when you stand in the present. But when the Kundalini rises, She pulls down all your attention inward and She pierces through this fontanel and you are surprised that there's no thought. You are absolutely peaceful. You are absolutely integrated. All the inner struggle is over and you watch the whole life as a big drama, like a witness. But you are fully aware. And if you want to think you can think, but this time your thinking is inspiration.

This Kundalini, which goes through these centres, corrects your physical problem, solves your mental problems, your spiritual problem, your economic problems, political problems, marriage problems: everything, in totality. Because now you are connected with the divine Power. Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God, and your life is filled with miracles and blessings. So many people write to Me every day, lots of letters about their miracles. They can't believe that their divinity is manifesting it. It has nothing to do with Me, it's your own. Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten many candles, you can also raise the Kundalini of others and you can also give realisations to others. You can change the whole world. Because Spirit is the universal being within you. So you develop on your central nervous system a new dimension of awareness, which we call it as collective consciousness. As you become like a drop in the ocean, the microcosm becomes the macrocosm. That means your being becomes the whole, the total. You become part and parcel of the whole. Say for example if that, this hand is hurt, another one will immediately look after it. In one body who is the other? But supposing this hand is dead, it doesn't feel anything, then whatever may happen to this hand it won't act.

I must tell you a very sweet experience of Mine, when I was in Russia for the first time, twenty-five German Sahaja Yogis came to help Me. I asked them ‘How is it you are here?’ They said, ‘Mother don't you think it is our responsibility to come and correct what our forefathers have done to Russians?’ You'll be amazed now, if you meet, German Sahaja Yogis are the gentlest. They are very good people. Now the Sahaja Yoga is working in fifty-five countries – South America, North America, Russia, all the five EU countries which make the European community, plus as you know Holland, Belgium, all the European countries and England. All east Asian countries, Japan and Australia. So you have brothers and sisters everywhere, and they are people of universal understanding. One has to understand that in the West, the whole civilisation has grown like a very big tree, because of science. But science doesn't talk of ascent, of soul. So we have to find out our souls, our roots.

Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of your roots. It is not a new movement, it has been there in, I would say thousands of years in practice, but very few people used to get their Self-Realisation. For example, at the time of Shri Rama, about eight thousand years before, His father-in-law gave realisation to one person, Nachiketa. Modern Sahaja Yoga is for giving realisation to masses. It is a movement of en masse realisation, so it is a collective work. So we have to be in collective after getting our realisation so that we are established properly in our state. Luckily in Belgium, we have very good Sahaja Yogis and also a very good ashram. But you don't have to pay anything whatsoever. All the knowledge about the divine laws, everything you will know in no time – within one month's time you can be a master. But you have to have a pure desire in your heart. This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, it's the desire Power of God. She's your individual Mother, She knows each and everything about you. Like your mother gave you... gave you birth without giving any trouble to you, She does beautifully. And it happens spontaneously; that's the meaning of sahaj.

The knowledge about Kundalini is unlimited. I, the spiritual ascent, realisation, all these subjects I have dealt in with so many languages for twenty-two years now. Thousands of lectures I have given. But see now this electricity, if I have to tell you about its history, and who invented it and how it was brought to Brussels and then to you, you will be bored stiff. But when you come here, they tell you, just switch on one switch and the whole hall comes on. In the same way, why not get it? Why not have your light first and then talk about it. It will take hardly ten to fifteen minutes, let's try, I’m sure you all will get your realisation today. But there's one thing I have to tell you that you cannot force, cannot force Self-Realisation on anyone, you have to ask for it with a big heart. Those who do not want to have their Self-Realisation have to leave the hall. You have to be comfortable. Absolutely.

There are three conditions. First one is that all of you should be fully self-confident that you are all going to get your Self-Realisation today. There is no need to doubt about it. Then second condition is to forget about what mistakes you have committed before. In short, you do not have to feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty do you know what happens? This centre on the left-hand catches very badly, and you’ll get tension, you’ll get spondylitis, you might get angina, you might get all your organs very lethargic. To feel guilty is a human fashion. This all-pervading Power is the power of knowledge, all the knowledge, absolute knowledge. Also, it is the ocean of compassion and blessings. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness, and it has the power to dissolve all your so-called small little mistakes. It does not think you are sinners or anything, it does not. You are human beings, you are not gods and only human beings can make mistakes. So I am trying to convince you that, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. After all, you are at the epitome of evolution. Only a little journey has to be done, at the most three and a half feet or four feet. But if you have this chakra [left Vishuddhi] caught up, Kundalini won't come up. So, this is the second condition.

The third condition is very simple, that you have to forgive everyone, in general. You don't have to think about the people who have troubled. Logically, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything, do you? But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are happy, and you are torturing yourself on their behalf. And then this centre, on the optic chiasma inside the brain, is a very constricted cross. And if you don't forgive, this chakra will never open. As it is you have tortured yourself all your life, and why do you want to miss out in your Self-Realisation? So don't say it's difficult, just say it out, ‘I forgive everyone of them,’ you'll feel much lighter. These are the three conditions you have to fulfil. I have to request you to take out your shoes so that we can have a contact with the Mother Earth and She sucks in our problems very well. That's all. [aside, as She puts out Her hands: Already they have got it.]

It will take about ten, fifteen minutes but please don't disturb others at this time. So, you have to put both your hands like this towards Me. And put both your feet away from each other. You will realise in Sahaja Yoga that there are two powers within us, one on the left and one on the right. The left power is the power of desire, ordinary desire. And right is the power of action. Now, so with the left hand, when you put it on your lap, very comfortably, be comfortable – put it on your lap if you want to, whatever you are comfortable – which is symbolic that you desire to have your Self-Realisation. Now please put your left hand towards Me like this on your lap, very comfortably, and we will use our right hand to nourish our own centres. This exercise only you have to do in My presence now. Later on, you don't have to worry, but when you go to the collective, they will tell you how to get this connection fixed. Now they will show you how we are going to nourish our centres one by one. [aside to the two Yogis translating: He will show, and you can also show. You can come forward. You take that for... And both of you should speak loudly, otherwise they’ll miss it out.]

So, first we put our right hand on our heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty, and Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother, who is called as Holy Ghost. If you become the Spirit, then you have the light and you become your own guide, your own master. Now you take your hand down in the upper portion of the abdomen, which is the centre of your mastery, being created by many prophets. First, you should see then you can close your eyes. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force divine knowledge upon you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your left hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. This is the centre which gives you divine pure knowledge. Now you have to raise your right hand again on your abdomen on the left-hand side in the upper part. Then you have to raise it to your heart again. Then you have to raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right. I have already told you about this centre.

Then you have to put your hand on top of your forehead across, and put down your head as far as possible; this is the centre where you have to forgive everyone, in general. Now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head and hold it tight and push it back. Please put your head upward as far as possible and here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine Power. Now the last centre, stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area on top of your head. Now please put down your head. Here it is very important to press back, press back your fingers – stretch them backwards so that there’s a good pressure on your scalp. Now press your scalp and move it seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do.

Now you will have to close your eyes, so please take out your spectacles. If you have anything tight on your neck or on your waist, you can loosen it a little bit. And please put both your feet away from each other. Put the left hand on your lap towards Me. Now please put your right hand on your heart. Here, you have to close your eyes and please don't open them till I tell you. Here you have to say – you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like. Now at this chakra, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself. Please ask three times: ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ Now if you are the Spirit, you become your own master. So now take your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left side, and here you ask another fundamental question about yourself. Please ask silently: ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ Ask this three times.

I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now take your right in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here, you have to ask six times, because this centre has got six petals, please say: ‘Mother, please give me pure knowledge,’ six times. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts moving upward, so we have to nourish our upper centres with our full self-confidence. [aside to Yogini translating into French: Loudly, loudly. Loudly, because they can’t hear, I think.] So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here, you have to say ten times, with full confidence: ‘Mother, I am my own master.’ Now raise your right hand on... I have already told you that the truth about is that, you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say twelve times, with full confidence: ‘Mother, I am the Spirit.’

I have already told you that this all-pervading Power is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you have committed, you to have to know that it will be dissolved completely by this ocean of forgiveness. So first forgive yourself and forget that you are guilty. So now please put your right hand in the corner of your neck and turn your head to the right. Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence: ‘Mother, I am not guilty at all.’ I have already told you that logically, if you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you play into very wrong hands and torture yourself. So you have to just say that you forgive everyone and this centre will open very fast.  So now please put your right hand on your forehead across and you bend your head fully. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, from your heart: ‘Mother, I forgive everyone.’ From your heart, not how many times. Now, take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to say from your heart, not how many times: ‘Oh divine Power, forgive us if I have done any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly.’

Now the last chakra, you should stretch your palm, and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood. Put down your head please, put down your head, and do not hold your head with your fingers but push them backwards. Now again, I cannot force Self-Realisation on you, you have to ask for it. So move your scalp seven times clockwise with a pressure, saying in your heart: ‘Mother, please give me Self-Realisation.’ Please bend your head, bend your head. [Shri Mataji blows into microphone]

Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes slowly. Put both the hands towards Me. Now don't think watching Me, don’t think. Now, put your right hand towards Me like this, put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own head – you can feel it on your left hand. Now, the hand should be a little away from the head. Now put the left hand towards Me, again bend your head and see with your right hand if there's a cool breeze coming up. Now again with the right hand, once more, feel with the left hand – right hand towards Me and left hand you feel it. You must bend your head, bend it a little, then you can feel it.

Now put both your hand towards the sky like this and ask one of these questions three times – put both, put your head towards the sky. Now ask the question: ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?’ or ‘Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of God's love?’ or ‘Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?’ Ask any one of them three times, the question.  Now please bring down your hands and again watch Me without thinking. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze in their hands or fingers or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. Don’t doubt, don’t doubt.

I bow to you all, all of you are saints now. Now the saintly life has started. But you must know that this is a collective growth. You cannot grow alone, so all of you have to grow. I will again come next year, and also tomorrow. [applause] Maybe overnight you will grow, very much. So now please call your friends, other people; this is the greatest thing you have to give to them. We have such nice people here, very beautiful. May God bless you all.

Tomorrow I’ll explain to you about nature of the Spirit. Thank you very much. Also tomorrow, I’ll meet you all individually.
