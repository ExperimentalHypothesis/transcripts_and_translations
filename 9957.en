Public Program Day 1

They are all in the same business, be-fooling people, mesmerizing them, destroying their chakras and making money out of them. I mean there are institutions, yesterday we discovered one lady who had been to some authorized institution for some sort of psychological analysis. And she paid a lot of money and what she got is a body which shakes in a very funny way all the time and she cannot stand even. This Mr Freud is also one another horrible fellow, he was respected more than even Christ in the West. And they followed him more than they could follow Christ. It's those funny intellectuals they take out some yarn out of their heads that work, even right from I would say from Tolstoy even so many people in every country have taken out some sort of yarn and have impressed people. He has really twisted the whole thing. The worst was I think that Paul has ruined Christianity. He himself was a. He had killed a disciple of Christ called Steve and he was a very cruel Roman. So he tried to find out the weakest disciple of Christ, who was Peter, and Peter is the one who was told by Christ that Satan will take over and he denied three times. These two put together edited the Bible. They fought with Mathews, Thomas ran away to India, and John would not write his theories. On his way, Thomas put all his theories in a big jar and buried them in Egypt. This was discovered only fifty years back and was rather decoded and is out now as I have told as a book. I had read the articles not what they have translated, and I was amazed that he's talking of the spiritual experience of self-realization throughout. But he called the people who got their realization as gnostics. Gn comes from Sanskrit, gn means knowledge. From which it comes the word gyana, gyana means the knowledge on your central nervous system. But not only reading, but Kabira has also said that people have become idiotic by reading too much. I had that experience now, so it's not learning, it's not a mental process but it is a state. It is a state you have to achieve. At this time it's so important to understand that whatever has been said in the scriptures, we can prove it. As in the Quran, it is written that at the time of Kayama, which is a resurrection, your hands will speak and give witness against you. That exactly what happens to you when you get your realization your fingers as is shown here get enlightened. First of all, you feel this all-pervading power of God's love as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Bible they have described about divinity, God the Father, God the Son, you have the Father and the Son, but Mother is missing, and not only that but She is made into a dome. I mean in Indian culture woman is the power, the shakti. And the Holy Ghost is the power of God, which is the Adi Shakti, the primordial Mother. A woman could be a priest, she could be a philosopher, she could be a guru, she is respected much more than I would say even saints, if she's she is a shakti. Because she's a Mother, she is the primordial Mother. Also in Greece, they have Athena who was the primordial Mother. Surprisingly â€˜Ath' means primordial in the Sanskrit language. So many similarities, but then I don't know why they forgot about it. Maybe the way they moulded the idea of primordial Mother. So there are many fundamentalists who hate us, who say things which are absolutely false against us. Because we believe in all religions and they cannot stand this truth. And another thing is that we say that you cannot take any money for spiritual work. Because it is Divine Love and you cannot pay for it. They don't like this aspect at all. This is how, but it has been always. Even Thomas had to, I mean face such horrible times, because gnostics were also troubled by the clergies, everywhere it happens when the reality comes all these fundamentalists try to suppress. But if you are a seeker, you must find the truth. You should not identify yourself with all these things because these are conditionings. You have to seek your spirit. William Blake has already prophesized that men of God will be born at this time and they will become Godly and make others also Godly. So that time has come now. Tomorrow I'll tell you more about the nature of the spirit. But today I have to tell you one thing, that when this kundalini pierces through your fontanel area and you get connected to this all-pervading power you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand, very gentle, soothing, relaxing. Also, to begin with, you feel the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Maybe you might feel little heat also coming out of your fontanel bone as if the funnel is open. So, a new state is established within you to begin with, that you'll become thoughtlessly aware. So, when you become thoughtlessly aware, you feel the present. You are either in the future or in the past, and our thoughts come to us from either from the future or from the past. And we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts. But if I say now take your attention inside, you cannot. That's only possible when you stand in the present. But when the kundalini rises she pulls down all your attention inward and she pierces through this fontanel and you are surprised there's no thought. You are absolutely peaceful. You are absolutely integrated. All the inner struggle is gone and you watch the whole life as a big drama as a witness. But you are fully aware. And if you want to think you can think but this time your thinking is an inspiration. This kundalini which goes to these centres corrects your physical problems, solves your mental problems, your spiritual problem, your economic problems, political problems, marriage problems everything in totality. Because now you are connected with the Divine power. Now you have entered into the kingdom of God, and your life is filled with miracles and blessings. So many people write to me every day, lots of letters about their miracles. They can't believe that their divinity is manifesting, it has nothing to do with me, it's their own. Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten many candles, you can also raise the kundalini of others and you can also give realizations to others. You can change the whole world. Because spirit is the universal being within you. So you develop on your central nervous system a new dimension of awareness. You should call it a collective conscience. As you become like a drop in the ocean. The microcosm becomes macrocosm. That means your being becomes the whole, the total. You become part and parcel of the whole. Say for example if that, this hand is hurt, another one will immediately look after it. In one body who is the other? But supposing this hand is dead, it doesn't feel anything, then whatever may happen to this hand it won't act. I must tell you a very sweet experience of mine when I was in Russia for the first time, twenty-five German Sahaja Yogis came to help me. I asked them "How is it you all came?" They said, "Mother don't you think it is our responsibility to come and correct what our forefathers have done to Russians?" You'll be amazed now to know that German Sahaja Yogis are the gentlest. They are very good people. Now the Sahaja Yoga is working in fifty-five countries. South America, North America, Russia, all the five EU countries which make the European community, plus as you know Holland, Belgium, all the European countries and India. All east Asian countries, Japan and Australia. So you have brothers and sisters everywhere. And they are people of universal understanding. One has to understand that in the West the whole civilization has grown like a big big tree, because of science. But science doesn't talk of the spirit, the soul. So we have to find out our souls, our roots. Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of your roots. It is not a new movement, it has been there in, I would say thousands of years in practice, but very few people use to get their self-realization. For example at the time of Shri Rama, about eight thousand years ago his father in law gave realization to one person, Nachiketa. Modern Sahaja Yoga is for giving realization to masses. It is a movement of amass realization, so it is a collective work. So we have to be in collective after getting our realization so that we are established properly in our state. Luckily in Belgium, we have very good Sahaja yogis and also a very good ashram. But you don't have to pay anything whatsoever. All the knowledge about the Divine laws, everything will be known in no time, within one month's time you can be a master. But you have to have a pure desire in your heart. This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, it's the desire power of God. She's your individual Mother, She knows each and everything about you. Like your mother gave you realization, gave you birth without giving any trouble to you, She does beautifully. And it happens spontaneously, that's the meaning of Sahaja Yog. The knowledge about kundalini is unlimited. I, the spiritual ascent, realization, all these subjects I have dealt in with so many languages for twenty-two years. Thousands of lectures I have given. But see now this electricity, if I have to tell you about its history, and who invented it and how it was brought to Brussels and then to you, you will get bored. But when you come here they tell you just switch on one switch and the whole hall comes on. In the same way, why not get it? Why not have your light first and then talk about it. It will take hardly 10-15 minutes, let's start, and I am sure you all will get your realization. But there's one thing I have to tell you that you cannot force, cannot force self-realization on anyone, you have to ask for it with a big heart. Those who do not want to have their self-realization have to leave the hall. You have to be comfortable. There are three conditions. First one is that all of you should be fully self-confident, you are all going to get your self-realization today. There is no need to doubt about it. Then the second condition is to forget about what mistakes you have committed before. In short, you do not have to feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty do you know what happens? This centre on the left-hand catches very badly, and you get tension, you get spondylitis, you might get angina, you might get all your organs very lethargic. To feel guilty is human fashion. This all-pervading power is the power of knowledge, all the knowledge, absolute knowledge. Also, it is the ocean of compassion and blessings. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness, and it has the power to disarm all your so-called small little mistakes. It does not think you are sinners or anything, it does not. You are humans beings, you are not Gods and only humans beings can make mistakes. So I am trying to convince you, that you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. After all, you are at the epitome of evolution. Only a little journey has to be done, at the most three and a half feet or four feet. But if you have this chakra caught up kundalini won't come up. So, this is the second condition. The third condition is very simple, that we have to forgive everyone. In general, you don't have to think about the people who have troubled, logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are happy, and you are torturing yourself on their behalf. And then this centre on the optic channel now inside the brain is a very constricted cross. And if you don't forgive this chakra will never open. As it is you have tortured yourself all your life, and why do you want to miss out in your self- realization? So don't say it's difficult, just say now I forgive everyone, you'll feel much lighter. These are the three conditions you have to fulfil. I have to request you to take out your shoes so that we can have a [UNCLEAR WORD]) with the Mother Earth and She sucks in our problems very well. That's all. It will take about 10-15 minutes but please don't disturb others at this time. So, you have to put both your hands like this towards me. And put both your feet away from each other. You will realize in Sahaja yoga that there are two powers, one in the left and the other in the right. The left power is the power of desire, ordinary desire. And right is the power of action. Now, so with the left hand put it on your lap very comfortably, comfortably put if on your lap, on your lap, this is symbolic that you desire for your self-realization, please put your left hand towards me like this on your lap very comfortably and we will use our right hand to nourish our own centres. This exercise only you have to do in my presence now. Later on, you don't have to worry. Later on, when you go to the collective you will know how to get this connection fixed. Now they will show you how we are going to nourish our centres one by one. First, we put our right hand on our heart. In the heart resides the spirit. Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. And Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother who is called as Holy Ghost. If you become the spirit, then you have the light and you become your own guide, your own master. Now you take your hand down on the upper portion of the abdomen, which is the centre of your mastery being created by many prophets. First, you should see then close your eyes. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force Divine Knowledge upon you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your left hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. This is the centre which gives you divine pure knowledge. Now you have to raise your right hand again on your abdomen on the left-hand side in the upper part. Then you have to raise it to your heart again. Then you have to raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right. I have already told you about this centre. Then you have to put your hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible, this is the centre where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now please take your right hand on the backside of your head and hold it tight and push it back. Please put your head upward as much possible and here without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. Now the last centre, stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area on top of your head. Now please put down your head, here it is very important to press back, press back your fingers, press backwards so that you can put full pressure on the centre, now press your scalp and move it seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do. Now we have to close your eyes, so please take out your spectacles, if you have anything tight on your neck or on your waist, please loosen it a little bit. And please put both your feet away from each other. Put the left hand on your lap towards me. Now please put your right hand on your heart. Here, you have to close your eyes and please don't open them till I tell you. Here you have to say, you can call me Shri Mataji or Mother whatever you like. Now at this chakra, you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself, please ask three times "Mother am I the spirit?" Now if you are the spirit, you become your own master. Now take your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left side, and here you ask another fundamental question about yourself. Please ask silently "Mother am I, my own master?" Ask this three times. I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge upon you. You have to ask for it. So now take your right on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here, you have to ask six times because this centre has six petals. Please say "Mother please give me pure knowledge", six times. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge your kundalini starts coming upward, so we have to nourish our upper centres with our full self-confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. Here, you have to say ten times with full confidence "Mother I am my own master". Now raise your right hand on, I have already told you that the truth about you is that you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and you have to say twelve times with full confidence "Mother I am the spirit". I have already told you that this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you have committed you to have to know that it will be dissolved completely by this ocean of forgiveness. So first forgive yourself and forget that you are guilty. So now please put your right hand in the corner of your neck and turn your head to the right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence "Mother I am not guilty at all". I have already told you that logically if you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you do not forgive then you play into very wrong hands and torture yourself. You have to just say that to forgive everyone and this centre will open very fast. So now please put your right hand on your forehead across and you bend your head a little. Here you have to say from your heart not how many times, from your heart "Mother I forgive everyone". From your heart, not like that. Now take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible, here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to say from your heart, not how many times "Oh Divine power forgive us if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly". Now the last chakra, you should stretch your palm. And put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Put down your head please, put down your head, and do not hold your head with your fingers but push them backwards. Now again, I cannot force self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So move your scalp seven times clockwise with a pressure saying in your heart "Mother please give me self-realization". Please bend your head, bend your head. Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes. Put both the hands towards me. Now don't think watching me. Now put your right hand towards me like this bend your head and see for your self if there's a cool breeze or hot breeze coming out of your head you can feel it with your left hand. Now the hand should be kept away from the head. Now put the left hand towards me, again bend your head and see with your right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out. Now again with the right hand, left hand, right hand towards me and left hand, you must bend your head, bend your head. 

Now put both your hand towards the sky like this. and ask one of these questions three times, put both, put your head towards the sky. Now ask the question "Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost" or "Mother is this the all-pervading power of God's love" or "Mother is this the Param Chaitanya" ask any one of these three times. 
Now please bring down your hands, again watch me without thinking. All those who have felt the cool or hot breeze in their hands or fingers or out of their head, please raise your hands.
I bow to you all, all of you are saints. Now the saintly life has started. But you must know that this is a collective work. You cannot grow alone, so all of you have to grow, I will again come next year and also tomorrow. So now please call your friends, other people, this is the greatest thing you have to give to them. We have such nice people in Belgium. May God bless you all.
