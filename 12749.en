What Is The Real Religion?

[1:10]
I bow to all the seekers of truth.
I’m sorry, the program in reality was not this month. Normally, we come there in August. Doesn’t matter. You people are already so well off in Sahaja Yoga, that I don’t know what else to tell more. You know about Kundalini and you know what is Self-realisation is. But today, the way they asked Me questions, I think I should explain one or two things.

First thing is that Christ came on this earth, and he established the Christian religion. He came to balance the people and to tell them that they have to know themselves. The first that was done, was to talk about balance and morality. Balance through morality was preached, but they could not achieve it. Unless and until you know yourself, the religion will come outwardly.

One may call oneself a Christian and do all sorts of bad things. So, one can call oneself a Muslim and can do everything that is wrong. But with Self-knowledge, religion becomes innate. It becomes part and parcel of you. You become really religious, you become righteous. You do not do anything wrong. This happening was important to happen.

So, I’ve come here to fulfil the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. If he had completed his work, he would not have said that, "I’ll send you the Holy Ghost".

Then, the same about Islam. Muhammad Sahib said two things. First is that, unless and until you know yourself, you cannot know about God. The second thing he said that the last Imam, the 12 Imam, who is called Muhammad al-Mahdi [from translation]. Mahdi means in 3 languages differently. In Persian language, it means, "the one who will guide humanity to lead a proper life". The second one means, "the primordial energy".

[A wasp disturbs Shri Mataji]
Shri Mataji: It’s a kind of a –
Rustom: Shri Mataji, [Hindi].
Sahaja Yogi: Go!
Shri Mataji: All right.

The second one, of course, which is innate, was the primordial energy. That is, in Sanskrit, we call it Adi Shakti. And the third one, the third meaning in Arabic language is [unclear, Arwa salem?] mean the primordial Mother. So, if Muhammad Sahib was the last, why did he say so?

Then there was Buddha. And Buddha said that, "There will be Maitreya", who is the future Buddha, that is three Ma. Mahakali, Mahasarasvati, Mahalakshmi. They all talked about this, about the resurrection time, about the Last Judgment. So, this is the time. How can I be in any way, against Christ or against anyone else? They are all like flowers on the tree of spirituality. But people plucked the flowers, and are now fighting with dead flowers. So, in Sahaja Yoga, the arrangements have been made to become. [A wasp disturbs Shri Mataji] To become really a Christian, really a Muslim, really a Buddhist.

But in Hindu religion, they know all about it. You don't have to explain anything to them. They already know, because it was predicted so well and clearly. What surprises Me, that in Tolyatti, there are so many Sahaja Yogis! I am very proud of you. In the whole world, apart from India, there is no place for Sahaja Yoga as here in Tolyatti. It is -
[Applause]
something, one cannot believe in. Because how far is this Tolyatti from India? But how the seed of spirituality prospers here so well.

Then another point is about this cult in Japan, what they did. They are just our opposite! Because they said that the whole world will be destroyed, and so we should destroy the world.
I can't understand Japanese being that stupid! Perhaps, they were all mesmerized. We have to give them the benefit of doubts. How many people they killed! It is all anti-God activities.
We are here to show what is the real religion, what is the reality. I know that you have understood. So, don't be upset if people talk like that, because you know what you have achieved.

I have to go now to Kiev, where there are many people who are waiting [unsure]. I would say that it will hardly take more than five minutes to feel your vibrations. You just put your hands towards Me.

Now, put your right hand like this, and put down your head. And see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze comes from your fontanel bone area. This is the actualisation of your baptism. Actualisation. It might be hot, so you have to forgive yourself and you have to forgive others.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me and now see with your right hand.

I know you have problems. But within one year, your problems should be solved. But you must meditate and pray.
Now all those who have felt really a cool or hot flow breeze on their hands, centre of their palms, on their nails, or we can say the fingertips, or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

I bow to you. I’m getting breeze from you. [Shri Mataji laughs]
Such beautiful people you are. I’ll miss you very much.
If you have problems- [Applause]

If you have problems, please write to Me. But ask someone to write it in English, because I don't know Russian. I'm trying to learn it.
Thank you very much.
[Applause]

All right. [End of Shri Mataji's speech at around 17:45 minutes ]

[Unclear conversation between Shri Mataji and a Sahaja Yogi]
[The Russian physician takes the mike for a conference]

[Gross translation of some parts of these 15 minutes: Dear brothers and sisters we live in unusual times very difficult not only for our fatherland but also for the whole world. The origin is the same both are Slavs and Serbs and Croats native people but there was a period when some were occupied by the Austrians and gave Catholicism. Others were occupied by the Turks and gave Islam to others. Serbs remained Orthodox Christians like our Mother Shri Mataji.
This circumstance led to the urgent solution of the issue it is necessary to unite all religions. God is one and religions are different and I do not want to offend anyone, but there is a religion that takes the best from another religion. For Muslims, we are all non-Muslims infidels and should be removed from life. See how incomprehensible, how bad is a religion calling for peace through war with other nationalities! For this purpose, Petrovskaya Academy of Arts and Sciences and Shri Mataji is an honorary member of the Petrovskaya Academy of Sciences.
I emphasize for beginners the only woman in the world the only honorary member. For this purpose, we had two international conferences last year in September and this year after a year and 5 days, we have the second conference already. And here is depicted Shri Mataji and the most influential spiritual figure of Russia in his authority of love for the fatherland Vladyka Metropolitan John Metropolitan of St. Petersburg. This means the entire large region and not only Petersburg looks for the solution of this main problem of peace and war....

What Shri Mataji brings to our country, is very important., I will tell you frankly, there was a question about banning Sahaja Yoga from our country of all directions... but the Metropolitan with a big heart, said India is a friendly country for us and we should not spoil relations on the basis of our differences... ]
[Shri Mataji leaves the place.]
Shri Mataji: Spasibo [Thank you]
