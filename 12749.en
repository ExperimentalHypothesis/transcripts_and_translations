I bow to all the seekers of truth.
I’m sorry, the program in reality was not this month. Normally, we come there in August. Doesn’t matter. You people are already so well off in Sahaja Yoga, that I don’t know what else to tell more. You know about Kundalini and you know what is Self-realisation is. But today, the way they asked Me questions, I think I should explain one or two things.

First thing is that Christ came on this earth, and he established the Christian religion. He came to balance the people and to tell them that they have to know themselves. The first that was done, was to talk about balance and morality. Balance through morality was preached, but they could not achieve it. Unless and until you know yourself, the religion will come outwardly.

One may call oneself a Christian and do all sorts of bad things. So, one can call oneself a Muslim and can do everything that is wrong. But with Self-knowledge, religion becomes innate. It becomes part and parcel of you. You become really religious, you become righteous. You do not do anything wrong. This happening was important to happen.

So, I’ve come here to fulfil the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. If he had completed his work, he would not have said that, "I’ll send you the Holy Ghost".

Then, the same about Islam. Muhammad Sahib said two things. First is that, unless and until you know yourself, you cannot know about God. The second thing he said that the last Imam, the 12 Imam, who is called Muhammad al-Mahdi [from translation]. Mahdi means in 3 languages differently. In Persian language, it means, "the one who will guide humanity to lead a proper life". The second one means, "the primordial energy".

Shri Mataji: It’s a kind of a –
Rustom: Shri Mataji, [Hindi].
Sahaja Yogi: Go!
Shri Mataji: All right.

The second one, of course, which is innate, was the primordial energy. That is, in Sanskrit, we call it Adi Shakti. And the third one, the third meaning in Arabic language is [unclear, Arwa salem?] mean the primordial Mother. So, if Muhammad Sahib was the last, why did he say so?

Then there was Buddha. And Buddha said that, "There will be Maitreya", who is the future Buddha, that is three Ma. Mahakali, Mahasarasvati, Mahalakshmi. They all talked about this, about the resurrection time, about the Last Judgment. So, this is the time. How can I be in any way, against Christ or against anyone else? They are all like flowers on the tree of spirituality. But people plucked the flowers, and are now fighting with dead flowers. So, in Sahaja Yoga, the arrangements have been made to become. [A wasp disturbs Shri Mataji] To become really a Christian, really a Muslim, really a Buddhist.

But in Hindu religion, they know all about it. You don't have to explain anything to them. They already know, because it was predicted so well and clearly. What surprises Me, that in Tolyatti, there are so many Sahaja Yogis! I am very proud of you. In the whole world, apart from India, there is no place for Sahaja Yoga as here in Tolyatti. It is -

something, one cannot believe in. Because how far is this Tolyatti from India? But how the seed of spirituality prospers here so well.
