Conversation with Yogis. Northampton (UK), 5 June 1979.

... any dimension it must be, just think of it. Now the permutations and combinations are, as I said, are thirty-four, thirty-five, crores [Hindi word meaning 10 million] of permutations and combinations. So, I told our great mathematician, Mr Djamel, to work it out. He said, “Impossible!” And he told Me some number; up to that we can. But this is too much. How can you work it out? How many permutations and combinations there must be in thirty-five crores of your mind.

Sahaja Yogi: Three hundred and fifty million.

That’s only – that’s the basic point, you see, but how many permutations and combinations out of them are active, and how they work it out? But the only thing that the human being has is to take it. You see, this is the most difficult thing. Even if you have the best on this earth, what’s the use? If human beings are not going to turn their hands towards Me, what can I do about it? Now all these permutations and combinations are fixed and very nicely done and they work very fast. They are very busy – I have seen it – and they work all over the world, all over the universe. But this little brain here is covered in something called as Mr. E G O and it’s very difficult for these little little things to ask them to open. It’s very difficult for them. They find it impossible and it is such a funny thing going on, you see, that every time a river flows and the people have to fill the cups that have to open, either they put the cups on the other way round or they put some stones and say that, “We didn’t get anything.”

So, this permutations and combinations business is so tremendous that I wonder at Myself sometimes how I speak to them, you see, to speak. You see, currently with all this going on you can imagine what must be the sense, and but for My sense of humor I would not have existed, allowed Myself to live. The amount of things I have to tolerate and the amount of [unclear] to which people come to and the way they behave, it’s fine, finding it out sometimes, and sometimes it’s the way they question Me. Then only thing I can do is to just laugh it out and use My sense of humor and be there and work it out. So this is the big problem and this problem is not so easy to solve, but some people do feel bad sometimes and they behave in a manner that makes Me know that they know about it very well and that’s why they are so frightened and they understand it very well

So, now we are today going to tell you about collectivity. You must hear the first part of this – is very interesting -but I am doing the second part now. Now, collectivity is a thing, is to be understood in a much deeper way than we have thought, you see. First of all, in collectivity, when we say this body is a collective instrument made out of many cells, all right? Then what do we understand? That first thing is, in collectivity we must realize that there is interdependence. We have to depend on others. Like he has to depend on her and she is dependent upon him. But when it comes to ego not only that it separates you from each other – that’s not the only thing it does – but it teaches you not to be dependent on anyone. You have to depend on others. You are not to exploit others but you have to depend on others and others have to depend upon you first thing very much. On this subject I’ll tell you a little more.

Now, for example there is one Mr X and another Mr Y who are Sahaja Yogis and X and Y have to depend on each other. Say a position like that comes up. So what should we do? We must try to find out the common point first of all. If there is a question of common point, it will not work out. So common point is – of course, you know that there is a common point between both of them – that they have been thinking and they have got it through Sahaja Yoga and that I am the person whom they think will resolve all the differences between them.

So, this is one common point, but the dependence between the two is to be prepared in a country where we don’t really go near them. First of all, when we try to depend on others, have we been able to create an atmosphere of dependence? Say, supposing you know I do not want My son to stay in My house, so how will I talk to My son? I will say, “You are good for nothing. You are such a liability. You are all the time on my head and you are troubling me such a lot.” All right. Or, “You cannot earn five pounds even.” What have you taught him? He gets hurt. “All right, I will show you.”

So, he goes out, digs a hole. He’ll do anything to show his mother that he can earn money, see, and that’s how he’ll work it out, isn’t it?

Another thing could be, simpler way, is to just throw him out, you see, and then you should say, “Look at him,” and you are having bad relations. I mean, you have done everything that is possible to create bad relations. Now, it’s just the truth. I mean, when you work it out that way, what do you expect to happen? The simple thing is that you have bad relations with each other. I mean, it’s the whole thing is worked out bad. So what is the other thing one has to do, is to prepare a ground.

Now how I would act if I want somebody to come to Sahaj, for example? I would find out what does he like to eat. What is he fond of? Or is he an intellectual? Then I should try to tell him that, “I don’t understand much or have not read much,” so that he feels all right with Me, that She’s all right. She is not an intellectual. There’s no confrontation at that point. So it’s all right. You see, intellectual is a trick, you see. I do it. So he comes in. Then when he gets realization, you see, how two people can inter-depend on each other after realization. You should see that supposing somebody is catching, all right. One way would be direct to tell, “Oh you are catching on Vishuddhi. Get out. We don’t want you. You get out. You are horrid. You just can’t stay”. That’s one way. Another is to say that, “Perhaps you know I think I am catching here on the Vishuddhi, or are you catching?” So prepare a proper seat for him in your heart. If you offer a seat in your heart, you see, half of these problems will disappear because he’ll have confidence that he has ? because he will feel that at last he has found out someone who understands.

So, the preparation should be more on this side, not on the other side of anybody who comes in, give him a punch, just like this. You must have seen these boxers have a punch in the house, you see, and any time they are passing by they just try to – I am sorry. So, and if they are intellectuals then they will try such punches which will be very subtle and intelligent. But a little bit, you see, put a little what we call a, in Indian language, a Phuljhadi, you see. Just put a little of a crackle here and there. And he goes out. He finds the crackle just bursting out, you see. So, all these tricks are self-destroying because you destroy yourself sometimes.

...yourself watch your own being. That is, how much are you disciplined in Sahaja Yoga? What are you doing for Sahaja Yoga? How much you are working it out? You see, I have seen, say, in a bhoot, you see. I always play such tricks with you, which I must tell you, that if there is something I’ll shout and say, “All right, now what are your suggestions?” So from the suggestions I know where you are. So I immediately know what is the position here, you see. I’ll take all the suggestions from you. Of course I do. But how much I agree...?..., that only God knows, you see. But, so the suggestions come in very seriously and I find that there’s a lot of negativity. So, it’s better not to suggest too much because if you suggest maybe you are a medium of negativity.

So, you first of all ascertain yourself how far you are, without feeling bad about it, because collectivity is the place where you belong to. You do not really belong to this individual being that you are. You belong to collectivity and that’s why you have to be there, and to be there you have to face your, all the time yourself and find out how far you are away from that collectivity, how far you are deciding things for yourself and not for the collectivity. You have to be very much on the alert and this is the discipline you have to pick out yourself.

The trouble is, you see the discipline we, if I tell you, “Get up at four o’clock”, you may get up. If I say, “Shave off your heads”, you can shave off. If I tell you, “Shave off your eyebrows”, you will shave off. If I tell you, “Just stand before Me for hours together”, you will stand on your heads for hours together. If I tell you, “You jump in the sea”, you may jump. That’s very easy discipline to do, nothing so difficult. You can do that. But if I tell you you have to be alert all the time, within yourself to see that are you in collectivity, are you doing something in collectivity, or you are doing something for yourself? Do not deceive yourself at this point because deceiving yourself means you are deceiving your collectivity. Your chances of being there which is beyond, which you have achieved. So try to do something which is congenial, helpful to collectivity. I’ve seen people, just wives talking to each other on Sahaja Yoga also. They’ll just pass a remark on someone, “Oh, he thinks he is being very clever”, you see. Now we have dropped a poison in the ocean of collectivity. Pour love, pour wisdom, pour understanding.

Put your fragrance of goodness. Do things in good faith. People have faith in you and they should not be shocked by the way we are. This is the discipline one has to have, and this discipline, if you have within yourself, for that you don’t have to do anything extra-curricular or something very much hazardous. No, to be on the alert, to be on the watch upon yourself. Am I there or am I doing it just to please myself, or to please this ego of mine? Myself is all right but this is the ego that one tries to work out, and that’s why interdependence is very difficult. You see, if I tell you, “Don’t be interdependent”, then you’ll do one thing. You’ll not borrow money, say, from others. That’s very easy. You’ll not borrow money. If I say, “Return every the money that you borrowed” all right, you’ll return every money. You’ll keep all accounts perfectly. I know you can do that and you can also have, “All right you can also have, all right you pay one ‘P’ all right, well one ‘P’ for one and a half – what do you call – slice of bread, to buy. You can do that. That you have done already and that’s not difficult for human beings. Equal distribution, absolutely perfect, honesty about it is possible. That one can do is to have a complete idea of how to maintain this beauty of honesty among yourselves, you see, that you do not depend. I do not mean that interdependence. I mean much subtler interdependence.

Interdependence comes in very, very easily. So, now you are sitting down here, now you know somebody is, for example, the name of the person, [Unclear: sitting with a person for a long time, just better check] somebody’s uncomfortable. You think about it. You are thinking, did you see that everybody is watching them? Are they all right? Give others a place in your place. If they are not feeling that you are thinking about their body, about their problems. Like I have seen when you love someone, you know that happens just to please him. That also not so great, just to think of that person more than yourself. Then you detach yourself from your ego. Have you been kind? Like this, there are so many things. In the night, have they got water to drink? All right, then you put a little water for them. All these small, small things you think of when you start loving. Oh, I am going to meet such and such a man. Now should I take something that person would like to have? A little thing, not much. This kind of feeling we should have all the time for others. Then interdependence is there. Then you will be amazed that the other person will depend on you entirely, entirely. Is not the independence of earning or money or anything that is important to such a person. If you can think that much for another person, that person can give everything to you and will entirely depend upon you.

Do you know I entirely depend upon you? Do you know that, that My complete existence is there because of Sahaja Yoga? Otherwise I would be finished at this moment. Perhaps you do not know it. I would not exist in this world if you people gave Me up. Is a fact which I must accept and which you must also agree. Because see now, if you do not take My vibrations, they will all be here frozen. I would become a frozen mummy, only emitting vibrations, that’s all. I won’t be speaking. It happens now. See, the left nabhi is just now, I am catching, is coming hard. You have to take out My vibrations. If you do not take My vibrations I am not going to exist any more as a human being walking, you see. And as something else maybe, but not as a human being as you see. I’ll be just frozen. If you do that to Me imagine how much I should owe to you. I mean, My existence is because of you. It is. Perhaps you do not know it. Do you know that I am here on this earth only because of you? Otherwise I would have been very nicely somewhere else. [Sounds like: tough luck] But then also you must know that as I depend on you, you also depend upon Me, but more I depend on your collectivity.

The moment you start becoming unaware of your collectivity, immediately cancer starts going in My body. I get physical troubles because of that. So the collectivity is not what you think of yourself, to be something great. It’s not that you are above everything and you are this and you are that. How much you have done to enhance the collectivity of understanding, of love. Because say if My, this hand doesn’t know this hand, now what do I do? If we are a living body, just think of it. I mean, if I do not know my one eye to another eye, if there’s no connection, what will happen to it?

And when you do all this it becomes a funny personality out of Me, you see. I don’t know how to manage Myself.

So, to sustain this interdependence you must learn to depend on each other. Now coming to the practical side of it I’ve already told you to think all the time of another person in a loving manner, not in a criticizing manner, not seeing to the loopholes of a person. See your loopholes and another person’s greatness. I mean, some people are real, I tell you, what we call drags, dragging down. Some people are like that. But to drag you is boredom you know sometimes, because they’ll talk about you, “Oh, this happened. Then my mother said so. Then my father said so. My grandfather said so. Then my aunty said so. I was coming – there was a seeker who did this and all round yourself. Is very boring! Just thinking about yourself, then you are not thinking of collectivity.

But a person who is collective is the most interesting person. The one who is not that way, he may think himself to be something great, so let him think, but he’s not interesting, extremely boring and people run away from such a person. The reason is he’s not collective. He’s not auspicious. So, to become collective you have to watch yourself like a [unclear sounds like : pussycat]. Now I would say for that, collective meditation is very important, which you have already experimented without finding there, those who have done it up to a point .......?.....and collective thinking. Now when ten people think together and are thinking collectively, it should move like one force. Even the water which is a dead thing for all that, it runs towards the slope, isn’t it? Or does some water run upward? I mean, it has one Swabhava. It has one style of thinking. In the same way Sahaja Yogis all must run towards God, towards Sahaja Yoga, towards collectivity. How can they run upwards? There is no individual working on this point. Once you start doing that way you are doing just the opposite of what you should be doing.

Then they’ll say, “Mother why we are not good? We have been working for so many days. It doesn’t work out.” This is the problem. If you are in the collectivity, even if you are not so good, you will be pulled in to it. Now what happens, it’s such a vicious circle that when you are not all right, you will always oppose others and create some sort of a silly situation, or you’ll bring out silly propositions or something like that you see, like a boulder inside the flowing waters. [Sounds like: so we find a little water]. And the suggestions from negative people will be always negative. So if there is negativity within us better to keep quiet. That is the biggest thing, to work it out, negativity. Better to keep quiet if you have negativity within you. Better to keep quiet. Try to remove the negativity. Because if you do not try to do that they act as mediums and they can use you as mediums and you become a medium of Satan instead of God. There you become very collective really. There’s a big fraternity among them.

But after realization the drive should be much more that you can resolve because there’s lots of mud sticking on the lotus which has come up. But when the lotus is high enough the fragrance is emitted. All the lotus in the beautiful pond emit the same fragrance and intensify. Nobody goes and says that the fragrance is from one lotus. The whole lake is named after [Unclear] imagine. The lake becomes smaller after the lotus flowers. That kind of fragrance of love should grow between you and such excitement and joy should be among yourselves, then the collectivity. Now for that you must know that you have to have self-preservation..?... It’s very important.

Like you say you are ten Sahaja Yogis here....?..., all right? So you must have the style of lotuses and you must have sense of self-preservation against other things. Now see somebody outside has come in. Then you all should immediately come together and form a nice club of your own, you see. Then the other person comes in. With all this force he will be dragged into it. But as soon as he says anything against anyone of you, you all jump on him. Then he will know they are all one. But normally you will find if somebody comes in like that possibly you may join the other fellow who is no good, who is going to create a problem between us. There is a possibility. So remember when facing others you are all one. Among yourself you can talk but facing others you should know they are the people who are still away from us. So this is the self-preservation thing which is very important you should have, and the self-preservation in Sahaja Yoga is to be preserved. In it’s purest it is very important responsibility on you people, because future Sahaja Yogis may not see Me, but you have seen and you know what is the truth.

You see, here the way we have lived a very pure ideal and pure Sahaja Yoga, absolutely above all kinds of nonsensical things. In the same way the people who are going to come after you also must think in the same way, in the same fashion. So you have to make a very pure relationship and a pure club among yourselves by which the people who are going to follow the progeny which is going to come is going to say, “This is what is being in Sahaja Yoga.” So the self-preservation also means the preservation of Sahaja Yoga in its purest form.

No, if you are doubtful ask Me. Verify it. And quote it only when you have verified it. Quote should be very important, because you are the foundation stones of Sahaja Yoga. And you have to be, every one of you, have to be perfect, so that this huge big mansion is not going to topple down because of you. There should be no weakness left in you.

[Newly transcribed]

That’s why it is important to understand that the self- preservation, preservation of Sahaja Yoga in principles of God’s laws, all must be preserved fully.

Do not formulate your own laws; do not try all this. Try to understand his laws, try to understand how he works. Try to be one with it and obedient and do not try your own tricks about it. If you find out something, you can always ask Me. And then again verify because that is also possible. People have done horrible things in it, which I cannot tell you what they have gone up to. And they became absolutely satanic and started doing all sort of nonsensical things. So be very careful on this point of preserving Sahaja Yoga in its purest form.

So, the third thing is that you all have to be homogenous, homogenous. Unless and until you you think that you are homogeneous, Sahaja Yoga is not going to work out. Is it, when I have told you to be facing another person, you all should be feeling the same. I have seen, sometimes, it happens, that say, there are ten Sahaja Yogis, and one of them is not good at that point, who cannot say. He should keep quiet. In all sense and reason, if he doesn’t know, then he should keep quiet, he shouldn’t talk about it. But he shouldn’t say, "Oh, no, no. I do not know, just now I am confused". No, before others. Because they’ll think that, "How can they be tree truths?" You see, if there is something wrong, it’s your family, it’s your own name, it’s yourself. So, the reputation, image of you, Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yoga depends on you.

It is supposing, if if my sari has a little spot somewhere, I would like to come and look at it. Why spoil the whole sari [unclear]?
In the same way, if you have any negativity, anything, don’t try to spoil it, because others will see that, and won’t believe in it, and will say, "Oh, there’s something wrong".
So, you have to be homogenous, anything you say, all of you should say the same thing.

Otherwise, I’ve seen even people, when there are others sitting, even Sahaja Yogis will stand and ask Me questions.
In the Caxton Hall, also some Sahaja Yogis will stand and ask Me questions. I mean, in all the places, you ask Me questions. When fifty percent of people are new, you just ask a funny question there. That means you have not yet identified yourself with Sahaja Yoga. It’s your own family. It’s your own reputation, it’s your name. You have to keep it afloat Because you have certain sinking things, you should not sink the whole boat or create a hole in it.

Because it comes out of a sense of being something significant. You see, like people put holes in their noses or in their cheeks to show that they have sone significance. You have no significance when you are sitting there, only God has a significance towards you [unsure]. You say the same thing all of you. Your significance is only great because you are dynamic people who are transforming that dynamic force to the ordinary people. That is your significance. So, be prouder of that significance than of the petty, useless significance by which you try to show off you are something very special. Or you can find out some very big point to ask Me questions.

In the Sahaja Yoga programs, when we are sitting like that, then you must ask Me questions, no doubt. You must ask Me. If there are problems, after all, I’m there. But not when others are there. Others are others, till they have joined us.

We are all one and we are not to question each other; we are not to misunderstand each other but we have to unite more and more forces. But just the opposite happens. You have seen that. Sometimes, it is so embarrassing, I don’t know what to say. Then I say that, "Look at your Left Nabhi", or, "Look at your Right Nabhi", or, "Look at your Agnya", or something and make the person's head down.

You see, question asking, is not a good thing in Sahaja Yoga. Most of your questions, I’ll answer. But till there are questions, you must ask Me. But the madder you are, the madder questions you ask Me.
Like today mister, I was saying ‘Simon the great’ he telephoned to Me. The first question he asked in the big temper, he said, "Mother, did you ask Phillipa that I should not telephone to you?" I said, "I did, I ‘m sorry for that. But you telephone too many times, it is disturbing Me. That is why I asked her. But I wanted you to find out how far you are settled down by telling her this. And I think that you not so furious as you would have been. So, calm down".
Second question comes in, "Mother, what about this Kalaki [Kalki], when is he coming? Who is he? What is the thing? You know all that. And how can you say that!" This is on the phone, you see. And he talked to Me for at east 15 days, honestly. So, you know, who is mad?

I mean, he is a confirmed mad. And anyone of you who does that, means there something wrong with you. So, "When is the new era is going to come? When is Kalki coming?" Then what? Is it important?

When others are sitting before us, is it important? Discussing. Diverting the attention, diverting, the whole thought is flowing to all the people there in one direction. Suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogis gets up with a big poster in the hand and says, "Oh Mother, please see this". I don't think that is a sign of maturity in Sahaja Yoga. Maturity in Sahaja Yogis, when Mother is speaking, put full attention to it and try to take all that force within yourself because you are like channels and you all channelize it. And it is you who are going to give it to others.
I am not going to give it; through your channels, I am going to give it. So the channels have to receive on one end and give. But if the channels start asking questions, what am I to do? So it should be homogeneous, means, you must know that we are all one, moving with one force. That is collectivity. As soon as you find out there’s too much arguments, get out of it. You will find definitely there is some sort of evil spirit going on. There should be no analysis, there should be no argument, there should be no explanation.

But thinking in a very homogeneous manner, as if one brain is thinking, for one common goal, itself is a very dynamic thing. You see, as destructive forces are dynamic when they use separation, and the Divine forces are dynamic when they use a complete integration. And integration also, one has to understand that it is complete oneness of all your good qualities together. They are all working together just like one personality. Everybody is giving one's own best to work it out and not to feel jealous of others. It's something so low level for a Sahaja Yogi to do, is to feel jealous, is to feel competitive. Because there is nothing like that, we are all one body. I told you. I cannot exist without you. If I am the brain, you are the body. If I am the heart, you are the hand. So I cannot exist without you. In the same way, you cannot exist without you all. And those who will try to do that kind, you see like nails with are out when you cut them, in the way, they will be thrown out.

So there's more intelligence, more wisdom, I would say, cleverness in understanding that you are living now in a higher life. You are talking of a higher life and for that you have to equip yourself. You will be only there through collectivity. If you leave the collectivity you are out of it.
As I always do, I have given you a very nice image [unsure] is that, that when you have to make the butter, you churn the yogurt. The churning goes on, and the whole thing becomes a mixture. Then you take out a little butter, and put it inside. Just like Me coming in, all right? And all the particles of butter will start gathering around that. And they are all sort of taken away from that mixture. But some of them stick on to the pot or stick around. They are never used as butter. They are thrown away with the rest of the water that is there.

So those who start thinking of doing something special, individualistic, or something great about themselves, they should know they will have no place in Sahaja Yoga. And I find out ways and methods of throwing them out. I have done that. [Unclear] have been thrown out. And that's why Sahaja Yoga does not spread that fast because there is a big feeling going on. All of you have to be homogeneous. Those who strive this God or those who try to have their own say, their own methods, are the people who will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga automatically. So try to be homogeneous. When you give some suggestions, try to suggest a person through meditation, through prayers, through vibrations, through bandhas. Do not directly do it. And best way is to tell Me. If you have any problem, it can be solved.

But do not try to solve your problems yourself which are difficult for you, which you [unclear]. All of you put together, you can solve the problem as Me. So, with all this you have to remember that those who criticize Sahaja Yoga are outsiders. So try to find loopholes are outsiders. You must find them out. It's easy to find them out when they talk from little different things they say here and there. You must know that they are outsiders. Still they are outsiders. They may not be meaningful, but try to tell them that collectivity means absolutely pure understanding of one thing that is you ...
[cut in the audio].

[About Carl Gustav Jung] ... forces beyond that, which control us. And the forces beyond us which control us, he called them as Universal Unconscious. Unconscious, because they are not in our conscious mind. And he called them as also as- you see, he actually did not know how to name it, you see. So he said that, he had said, it is the Mother’s force, the motherly force. Very clearly, he has said. And he studied Indian also, Indian literature and all that. And he had developed some thought on Shakti cult also. So, he has used the word ‘shakti’ for the Universal Unconscious.

But still, he was just a Realized soul. There was no Mother to tell him what on Unconscious or God. So, he could only indicate and tell you, that there is an Universal Unconscious which is guiding you. He experimented with people with their dreams. There is a very famous dream which he interpreted, about a man who would always dream that he has to bow to his own son. His son is sitting on a pedestal, and he has to bow to his son. The son might be a Realized soul. So he came to him and he said, "I don't know why I get such a dream". So Jung asked, "What is your relationship with your son?" He said, "It's very, very bad". "But why?" He said, "I am, you see, his mother is dead, I am married again, and my wife is very angry with him. And I really don't know what to, how to manage it. The relationship has gone very bad". So he said, "The unconscious is telling you that you must bow to him. He is of a higher awareness. So, you must bow to him. It is giving you a balance".

Then there was another girl who came to him, with a dream - I mean to just to put two dreams together actually. She said that, "I see my mother as a witch ". So he asked the girl, "What is your relationship with your mother?" She said, "It's very fine, very good. She actually pampers me. She has pampered me so much that I am just good for nothing". He said, "That is the thing is coming to you from your unconscious, to suggest that your mother is a witch who is spoiling your soul".

And there are thousand and ones like that, you see, there are so many volumes of Jung which you can read for yourself. So the psychologists have told us, that the state of human awareness would reach at a point when he will be thoughtlessly aware. He will be aware but there won't be any thought. This is said by Jung who was a psychologist. So we should know what we have to expect.

Now there's another source which is very clear and very, very good, which we can understand are the scriptures. If you read John’s Revelation, you can read about all the thing. You will know that the cool breeze is to be expected. If you read Shankaracharya, of course, I need not hear much more, because he's the one who has completely exposed the whole thing in the sixth century. This knowledge was a secret knowledge before that, because evolutionary forces had not taken its proper course. It was kept a secret knowledge, a guarded knowledge for very few. Only in the sixth century he started exposing it.
Then Kabira and Nanaka, all these people came out with full exposition of Kundalini. The greatest work done on Kundalini was in Maharashtra where Nath Patis, the nine Nathas, the primordial masters they call themselves, worked on it. And also in other places, they also came from Punjab. There was a big rapport between Punjab and Maharashtra.

And they went into the forest, they meditated and religiously tried to find out what was Kundalini, what was the force, what was the seed within us, what was the germinating force that is going to give us this! Because one or two were Realized whenever they talked about Realization, nobody could believe them nor could they understand that there is a force like that. And they said, "Oh, [unclear], we are happy with ourselves". Moreover, the people who were Realized had such bad experiences of all these people, like they were beaten up, crucified, they were poisoned. I mean, imagine the people! What was there to crucify Christ? I still can't understand.

So, the very sensible people of this world, looked at all the explanations about God and Divinity with that kind of a style, attitude. And there was no way of changing the attitude of these people. And this hostility was expressed even by religious organizations. You see, anybody who was a Realized soul was thrown away from churches, from temples. These Brahmins killed them, they tortured them.

The last one that we had was the Shirdi Sainath. And if you see how the Brahmins from another area, from Ahmednagar, how they tortured him, you'll be surprised. Not only that, but they brought a snake charmer, with a snake to kill him. But he got hold of the snake and he talked to the snake. So, the snake went away and bit the charmer.
[Laughter]
Then he was the one who got up and saved the charmer. And he told him, "Don't do all this". He said, "I would not but people, these Brahmins, have given me money". So, the people who were supposed to be in charge of religion themselves, crucified those saints who talked of reality. And that's how reality was completely blinded. Nobody could see it and people were [unclear].

This was the problem. And that's why somebody had to come and do this, to give a mass Realization to people, so that it becomes a common knowledge. Everything that is discovered by one person has to become the common knowledge, otherwise it has no meaning. Even in the science you see, you find out about electricity. It has a big history behind it, whatever it is. But at a point, it has to become a common knowledge. If it is not a common knowledge, it will never be accepted and it has no value at all. It has to become a knowledge of every human being, otherwise it has no meaning. And the time has come for you to have the actualization. And to have the complete knowledge of your being, what you are, what you are going to be, what you could have been, what are the problems around you.

So in us it's placed, the germinating force. We are all built in it. It's like a computer. Absolutely living computer within us is placed through our evolution. One by one, step by step, all these points have been properly put down in our backbone, in our brain and in the limbic area, absolutely in a perfect manner. And the only thing that one has to do, is to surrender, accept it. But we'll surrender to all kinds of nonsensical things but to the right person, our ego will immediately stand up, you see. If somebody has two horns it is very easy to surrender. Or if somebody is very cunning very easy, to surrender.
But where do you surrender? Is to the Divine force, to yourself, to your wisdom.
What do you surrender? Is your nonsensical, idiotic ego.
What do you have to surrender to God? What do you have?
Only with non-knowledge which has come to the ego, or sometimes through these possessions, you see, the superego.

Now for surrendering people think, how can I surrender? Now you cannot think about it. How should I surrender?

Can you work it out on a paper? I will do this x plus x is equal to so much. It's very simple. How do you laugh? Do you sit down and make a picture, "Now, I'm going to laugh, my child. So, I will make a laugh with this much angle and this much angle. Then the baby there, at this angle. Look at her with this angle.
[Laughter]
Then I'll turn left, right. Then again, I'll put the child this side". Do you do like that? You know how to laugh, don't you? It's built in you. Surrendering is nothing but is the love of God that is within you. He is within you in your heart. He's there. All the scriptures have said that. And none of them are wrong or false. They might have misinterpreted somewhere. Everybody has played tricks, you see. Our Tantrikas in India, all these who are nowadays gurus, were Tantrikas once upon a time in the sixth century.

They entered into all kinds of things. And the worst thing they entered into, are the Vedas themselves, you see, where they declared that, even a thing like ‘Ashwamedha yagna’ [unsure], which is a very pure thing is also oriented from sex. What do you say to that? Even they said that God and the Goddess, the God and His power are sex relationships. I tell you. They think human beings are nothing but sex points. They have nothing else in them! Even an amoeba has something more than that.

But we accept them. Why? Because we are seekers. We are seekers and we are seeking. We are born in this world to seek. We have taken our birth specially at this time to seek. We have been seekers all our lives and today we want to seek. And how are we going to seek? Wherever we get a chance, we run to it, I know.

It is hard to understand that you don't have to do anything, just sit right. The boat is moving and it will take you to the other bank. You don't have to do anything. It was going to work out. It's a throne. Three has to mature. Now the flowers are there. They attract the bees. The bees come at the right time. They blossom at the right time and also the fruits appear at the right time. It has to mature. It has to take its own course and time. The way you are built in, the way you are made, it has to complete its round so that another round starts. And that's why this hurrying up has nothing to trouble. That's all. Nothing more than that. And it is very easy to correct. There's no problem about it. It's very easy because once you have light within you, you will start seeing everything very, very clearly.

Because there is no light, it becomes so difficult. Have you tried climbing up steps without lights in a new house, which you have never been? Three times you’ll fall down before you get over one light. But if there is light, whatever type of the house may be, wherever you have been, you can get [unclear] better.

In the same way, unless and until you are enlightened, unless and until you are Realized, unless and until you have that Power flowing through you, you cannot understand and you cannot see that how simple it is. And you are so beautifully built, in your previous lives, that once you get this awakening within you, you start awakening others, immediately. And you can start it on somebody else. But, you see, just now it's such a powerful thing that most of them have got it. So, I don't know where are you going to try. That's the problem.
[Laughter]
Most of them have got it. Sometimes, it happens like that. "So, whom are you going to raise now, Mother? Everybody is Realized".
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] she said.
Lady: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: She's got it too!
You see that's the problem, that it is so powerful. But you'll find that it will settle down again. It has to go back, because we have got chakras within us, the centres, which are being exhausted.

Like, I would say, now this side is the left side and this is the right side. And both sides are the sympathetic nervous system. The right side sympathetic nervous system works for your mental being and for emotional being, of your mental being and for your physical being. And the left side for your emotional being. In between is the central part, it’s the parasympathetic.

Now we underline subtle energies that control these two left and right. The left one is controlled by the Power which we call as Mahakali's power, which is ‘Aim’. Then the ‘Hrim’ and the ‘Klim’, you see. The ‘Hrim’ is the central power, ‘ra’. ‘Ra’ is energy. ‘Hrim’ is the one which gives you evolutionary powers and also sustenance. Like carbon has its own sustenance and like gold has its own sustenance as you have your own sustenance. Everybody has the sustenance, through this central power of ‘Hrim’, is the power of Mahalakshmi.

And the right-hand side power is the power of Mahasaraswati. Now you shouldn't get upset with this Sanskrit language. It has nothing to do with any particular community or deity. Because these were found out by saints who were meditating in India, and they knew Sanskrit language, that's why there are in Sanskrit, you see. Moreover these [unclear] also.

Science, you see, has developed here, but also in India, a kind of a science developed. And the science that was developed in India was the science of Kundalini. It's the force of the germinating power, the residual power within us. And this science has seen or has actually experimented, with the movement of the Kundalini where it moves, the sound it makes. And these sounds are different on different centres within us, which are seven basics but there are eleven otherwise. And there are three, how much is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Three hundred and fifty million.
Shri Mataji: Three hundred and fifty million. All right?

So, this is the thing, three hundred and fifty million. But we deal only with seven at the most with eleven. Not more than that because it's too much a headache. Why should you worry?
[Laughter]
You need not worry. Now you are sitting in this room, it's all right, perfectly well. Why should you worry from where this electricity has come? And from how many drops it must have taken to create this much of electricity? Is it from the water or from the coal? Or what is the history in work? Who is bothered? You just put on the light and enjoy. They have done it for you! It's all done. In this also, you must take it for granted, that it's all done for you and you have every right to have it.

So this Kundalini, when it passes through all these various chakras, it makes a sound. And that sound has been taken by those people in the ancient days, as the phonetics, phonetic sounds for forming the Sanskrit language. That's why Sanskrit is used for controlling the Kundalini, the movement of the Kundalini. And the centres that are within you have got a mark, a landmark of your evolution.
For example, the leaders who came at different stages of your evolution, were actually the incarnations of Divine power and they have left a mark within you and they exist within you at that particular center. So when you say a particular mantra, that deity opens up and starts emitting energy. But still, human being without Realization is a limited energy. His deities have limited energies. But if he is put in connection with the All-pervading Power, through Realization, then his deities are also limited.

Like if you have a car and you have a limited petrol, all right? And the petrol shortage is there too. Then you are put into tension and you do not know what to do. But supposing there is a permanent pipe, on your cap of the petrol track, you see, which is filling it permanently, then you don't have any tension. You are not bothered what is exhausted. Now this exhaustion on all the centres, because these are the underlying forces of all the plexuses that we have outside. When they get exhausted, the plexuses that are acting our body, our mind, our thinking, our emotional activities, all of them get exhausted. And then we develop diseases of various types: physical, mental, emotional.

So, to make these centres awakened is a very important thing, even from a day-to-day life style. Like you must fill them up, you must awaken them so that at least your health is all right, your wealth is all right, your mind is all right and also your emotions are all right. This is the basis. But ultimately what do you get? Ultimately, you get that connection which is all the time flowing. Not only that much, like unless and until you get this connected to the mains you cannot work it out. It may be very nicely made, what to do with it? So, the first thing is put it to the mains. When you put it to the mains then only you will realize also where is the problem. Otherwise you will not know.

But when you get your Self-Realization, you know your problems within yourself. This is the first thing. That is Self-Realization. You know your centres, how they are affected, where they are affected, what is the problem there. And you get the power to cure them. Of course, thoughtless awareness is there, no doubt. But plus that immediately, a person whose Kundalini has crossed Agnya, only Agnya, may not even get Realization, can cure us. That's how we have half-baked curing people. Mostly then they get possessed and they get spiritualists, you see. Their Kundalini only rises up to Agnya and some spirit comes into them, they become spiritualists.

But you people, even if it crosses Agnya, immediately you can start curing people. When it crosses Sahasrara, this point, the last point, then you enter into that area or into that subtle awareness which is all-pervading. Just now we think that, "You are different, she is different, she is different". But there is a thread passing through you. If your attention becomes that thread, then you can pass into anyone. That's how though you know yourself, you know your problems, everything, you also know others immediately!
That is what is the collective consciousness about which Jung also has indicated. So you have to expect collective consciousness. That is, it’s an actualization. That is that your consciousness, your awareness gets that dimension in actual form that you become that.

To explain it to you, like animals walking through dirt and filth and never feel any dirt or filth, they cannot see beauty. But you can.
We cannot walk through dirt and filth. Our awareness is very different from that of animals. In the same way, when you become this, then your awareness becomes so beautiful, that you start feeling the sin. You start feeling the wrong. I don't have to tell you. You will not just do it. I don't have to tell you. Automatically, you started feeling what is good for you and what is bad for you.

Say, our Rustom has not come, I never tell, "Don’t try it", like the Muslims do. No, I don't. Nothing. "You go ahead, have cancer, have everything nice and then come to Me. Have your liver absolutely shattered, be a drunken fellow, then you come to Me. All right, doesn't matter". Then I realize the shift takes place. Immediately, the priorities change with you. Absolutely. You will be amazed, I have seen people who have been terrible drunkards, you see. They said, "Mother we can't drink". I said, "What happened?" "We vomit". Same thing happened with Rustom, he started vomiting. And he couldn't take it, you see. I never told him.

Then you just enjoy something else. Because if you get the nectar of life then you don't run after frivolous things. Useless things. Your dignity becomes different, you become different, it's entirely different. Your sense of enjoyment is so different. You become really beautiful flowers. And the fragrance people can see from a distance, even from a telephone.

It's so dynamic and that is what that, it should happen to you. For that what should you do? People say, "Mother what should you do?" Nothing, just ask. Just you ask. You have to knock at the door, that's all. Even if you do not knock, your Mother is going to knock at your doors.

She's very persuasive. She will come to your house, and make you comfortable. She'll massage your body, she'll massage your head, and she'll massage your back and work on you and she'll see to it, that she brings you round. She has too much patience. And you'll be amazed that, if I'm tired, I feel better when I really do that.

Like Patricia came and she said, "Mother, you do so much for us, you've done so much and let me, I must do something for you". I said, "What can you do? " She said, "I'm very good at massaging the feet". I said, "All right, do it". She was massaging my feet and her feet were massaged. And she couldn't understand it. And she was feeling relaxed while she was massaging my feet. I said, "What's happening?" She said, "It is so [unclear], I'm getting relaxed while I'm massaging your feet". So, that's what it is. That you must know that you cannot give Me anything. I'm here to give and you are there to take. That's your right to take it and you'll have it. It's your own.

It's like a Mother who loves you such a lot, and she has such a lot of property. Everything is your own. Just take, just have it. You see, the greatest pride for any mother should be that she sees her children thrive on her power. And then they achieve their own power, and render it to others also. And they become the joyous, happy, blissful children.

That's the way I see my dreams. And I'm sure the time has come for it to be fulfilled. I'm sure of it. I had to come to London, and they'll have lots of Sahaja Yogis in India. India is a place, it's full of good vibrations, no doubt, because we have had great saints coming to India, even Christ was there. But it's like, when you have teeth, you don't have food to eat. And when you have food to eat, you don't have teeth. Like that, is the situation. While here you are the saints, are born in this country and you are misguided. And there we have people who are not seeking and they have the vibrations. This is the dilemma of Sahaja Yoga.

They think, you know, so many of them think that, you people are seeking because you are upset with the too much of machine-oriented society. That's all. They think it’s more, your seeking is more like a remedy for ills, that you have got here. They do not think that you are seeking something so deep, and that there is a seeking of love. They do not understand. But in India also, I must say Sahaja Yoga has clicked very fast. And once the fire has started working, it’s going very fast, you see. And how, sometimes, its works is so interesting, it's so interesting, that you just live for that, [unsure] you know.

Like in Delhi, we had a program of opening this book, releasing this book for the first time. And I said, "I don't know. It's too much for me, how will I manage?" I have never done that sort of a thing". They said, "No, no Mother, only, you have to just give a lecture, that's all. You think it's a Sahaja Yoga program and then we’ll look after the rest of it". So, the President of India, you see, was somehow, cured by Me and all that. And so, they wrote to the President of India, [unclear]. Luckily, he never turned out, it was a good idea. So they said, "Mother, we can't get him. So why not you become the President then?" I said, "If you think I'm all right, I don't mind becoming the President".

And the whole press was there, all the members of Parliament, everybody very critical and all thinking. Can you imagine? We had taken the - they were taking a hall for two hundred people. I said, "No, no, just take for eight hundred". They said, "Will it fill up?" I said, "You just take for eight hundred people minimum". And all these people came. I don't know with what ideas they came there. But there was no place, even in the passages to move. People were sitting in the passages there. And I said, "Look at this, new faith coming up". And I said something which I've never said before.

I have used lot of tact in this life of mine, because people don't want to hear anything. Like Christ, what did He say that, "I am the light, I am the path", which He was. This is not egoistical, is it? You think so? I mean if you are something. Now if I am Nirmala, I should say, "I am Nirmala". Is it egoistical?
Like Krishna has said, "Sarva-dharman parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja". [Gita, chapter 18, verse 66] You have all these dharmas, it’s all these like religions. He didn’t mean the religions within. But what He is saying that all sorts of sustenance that you are absorbing, just come to be surrendered to Me so that you go beyond all these dharmas. Was He egoistical? But He was very tactful, He didn't tell 'en masse'. He told only to Arjuna. Nobody else. But somebody who had an eye and ear to hear that heard it, and wrote it down. But Krishna never told it to the masses, no.

Christ did that and what did you do to him? He didn't do any harm, did He? Just what they said. So, I’ll be extremely tactful. I am very elusive by nature. So, don't be taken up by my words sometimes, that’s for you [unsure]. I am elusive, that's the only way I can approach you.
People have tried all sorts of things. Like Krishna's, you can say, diplomacy. Then Christ sacrifices. Now mine is the style of elusiveness.

Because if I were not, you would not come near Me. First of all, I must appear just like you. Which I do not so much, sometimes. But most of the time, I do. And I should be thinking just like you. Absolutely, you will never know. In your hearts of hearts, you may know. But the illusion will be all the time maintaining so that you receive it fully, completely and you master it without feeling any awe of Me. You have to be absolutely free with Me. Absolutely free. And I assure you all the protection.

Everything that you have to tell Me, you can tell Me. Everything that you want to do, you should know. And the most secret things, which are regarded as the secrets of secrets, I am going to tell you, which even the greatest saints of India do not know. They cannot raise the Kundalini the way say, Douglas can raise or say, Pat can raise or Govind can raise. They cannot do. Just by raising your hands you can raise the Kundalini. And they are quite jealous of you. They asked Me also, "Mother, why have you done such favour to these people? Who are they?" I said, "They are mine, Me, myself. They are Me". And they are quite surprised the way you can manifest your powers.

I hope that great country, England, which I have said, again and again, is the Heart of the universe. You must understand ‘Heart’ has to stand up for reality and has to fight the satanic.
So, that you prepare for the advent of the last terrible One, who is going to come with his eleven destructive powers, and just going to sort it out. And there is no persuasion, no Realization, no knowledge, nothing but sort it out. Before that, you have to save all your friends, save all the people and salvage them. And you are the warriors. You are the people who are going to do it. I am just in the background. I don't do anything. I talk, that's all.
May God bless you all.

[Shri Mataji is now talking to the new people]

Regarding the different deities, have you got, [unclear]? And the centres, they know all those things?
Have you got one of these things here? No.
Sahaja Yogi: I've got some literature, I mean little.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Sahaja Yogi: The little printed ones.
Shri Mataji: So just show them what little printed you have.
Now you can get those [unclear] and all that. And you can see for yourself what are the centers and how they are represented on your feet. When you Realized, you can start feeling it.
For example, these children have cold, you see? So, I start feeling burning on the right-hand finger.
Not that I feel, but you would start. See, they are feeling on foot with the cold the children had, and it's working out. This is the center of Vishudhi. And when there is cold, you feel it.
On the right hand is the physical, as I said. On the left hand it when the person feels guilty.
Mostly he may be a Catholic.
[Laughter]

It is very interesting, you know, to find out about people and you're amazed when you discover it.
Like Gavin, you know, one day, he was worried about his father that is not a [unclear] "Why you worry? Just see the vibrations". This is telecommunication, absolutely.
He said, "Mother, I'm getting prick here". I said, "That's your father". You see, this is [base of the fingers on the right palm] your father, this is [base of the fingers on the left palm] your mother. I said, "All right, so he's got something wrong with his [unclear]".
So, he gave him a call and his mother said that, "You see, he has had very bad bronchitis or something". We saw even when Nixon going into problems, you see. We could see it long time back before it happened, you see. A person may appear to be very great, a very big thing, you just put your hand. Now you will know what sort of a fellow he is. Your vibrations will immediately stop or you get tingling, sometimes burning.

Sometimes you get blisters, that bad. You yourself, you are the instrument. You are the one who diagnoses. You are the one who cures. This is the power of Self-realisation.

Is there any question?

Seeker lady: Hum, yes. There is a question I want to ask.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Seeker lady: I but what you're talking about, how, Peter, and tell me a little about you. What is the relationship between Self-realisation that you're almost immediately and enlightenment in the sense of being free from the wheel of karmas. Do you see what I mean? That, that-
Shri Mataji: Enlightenment part?
Seeker lady: Well, in the sense of being free from the wheel of karma. Do you see what I
Mean?
Shri Mataji: Well, immediate, immediate release. What is karma? You see, also you must understand what is the karma is, do you? Karma? Who does the karma? It’s your ego. What karma do you do? Nothing.

It’s your ego that gives you the sense that you are doing. You don't do anything whatsoever. I can tell you this. It’s the ego within you which does it. Now the ego is here, like this. You see, rises from the right and goes that way, and superego that way. When the Kundalini rises, both are sucked down. And your attention is above the ego. Then you laugh at it, "Oh, Mr. Napoleon, how do you enter the Sahasrara?" The karmas are resolved because you have no ego. It's like this, very simple.

It’s, say, when the sun is on the side, you can see your shadow. All right? But when it comes on your head, the shadow disappears in you.
[Unclear words]
Seeker lady: When one is sort to believe that this is something-
Shri Mataji: That's how they must do it. You see, all of them are like that, tubs [unsure]. So, what they have to be- they have to make you believe into something, you see. Otherwise, how are they going to say why you don't get it? It’s by your karma. Then why are you there?
You see, what I would say that, what are you doing there collecting our money? Simple question. You see, if it is our karmas by which we are suffering, you are the ones who are gambling [unsure].

There's one very wonderful one in Behar. He said, "I take only one upon, a hundred and something of your karmas". I said, "Why is this small amount? Why not the whole of it? " And then he says, "You see, for the rest of it, you have to work hard". "And what is working hard?" "It’s service". "What is service?"

Big, big trunks[unsure], you see. And there's a big, what you call, piggy bank, you see, pig like that. And the piggy bank is the service. And people from all over the world come there for that service and that cleansing them. You see, they are befooling you.

Seeker lady: [Unclear words] You said earlier something about we come to you. Is it worth someone? Is it in the palm? We have done something to merit coming to you. Is it like that? Because it seems it's always too easy, you know? You see what I mean?
Shri Mataji: Why should it be difficult?
Seeker lady: Well, no,
Shri Mataji: No. I tell you one, very simple is. See, your breathing is so easy, isn't it? Did you consult any book or did you find out about karma? Because it's so important for you, in the same way, your evolution is very important. If you are not evolved, the creation will have no meaning. It has to be the simplest of it, ‘sahaja’, it's spontaneous. How can it be difficult? Just think of it. It has to be the easiest.

Seeker lady: [Unclear] But the thing is, I always felt that if my life is difficult, it's because I've done things wrong in the past, which are very bad. I've made it like that. It seems unlikely that my life is getting -
Shri Mataji: Oh, this is an old trick. They have tried with everyone. Like your priest telling you, "Come and confess something". Now those who have not done any sin, what are they going to confess?
So, they find out something, "I must have done something, otherwise, I have to face the priest, what am I to tell him?" Then ultimately the priest ends up in the lunatic asylum also. You go and tell him, "I can confess. I can confess all nonsense. Nonsense".

Like in India, you see, we had the priest coming to villages. And he started teaching them about Christianity. When he was going, the head of the villages, he didn't know how to thank him. He said, "Sir, we are thankful to you for visiting our village. You have really enlightened them. Because we did not know what was sin. Now we know what is sin".
[Laughter]

It's like that, you see. For this enlightenment, only in modern times, you have to pay. It's so simple. And they have done the difficult work, quite in time for you.
What sin can commit my son which is greater than the love of God? Tell me one.
