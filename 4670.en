Easter Puja, “The Creation of Lord Jesus”. Nightingale Lane Ashram, London (UK), 11 April 1982.

I’ll talk before and then at the time you can just tell me what time it is. The radio is off? You can keep it till eight o’clock and...

So happy to wait on you

[Shri Mataji smiles to the sahaja yogis and does namasté].

Today we are celebrating a day which is a very, very important, absolutely the most important, we can say, day, when such a great happening took place. And it had to take place that way – it was all in a way destined.

In my last lectures I have told you how Christ was created first in the heavens.

In the Devi Mahatmya, if you read that, He was created as Mahavishnu and is mentioned very clearly, that first He was created as an egg.

It is written in this book, which perhaps was written about 14,000 years back. It’s a book that predicts about Christ, and that is why people in the West, specially, offer an egg to each other as a friend.

The first existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ, and part of it was kept in that state and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost, by Mahalakshmi, to create Christ out of it.

In that ancient book He was called as Mahavishnu; means the greater form of Vishnu.

But actually Vishnu is the father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.

After my lecture I would like, if you have the book, to read it out to them, the whole texts of how Christ was created.

And when He was created, He cried for His Father, as He cried also on the cross once. And He cried for years. And then Christ, in Mahavishnu state was blessed by His Father who said that, “Your position will be placed higher than Mine. And You will be the Adhara,” means the ‘Support of the Universe’. See, how from Mooladhara He becomes the Adhara. This was all done at the heavenly stage - Vaikuntha stage you can say. Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost, who was the mother of Christ on this Earth, who was nobody else but was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi; means She was Radha. Ra-dha. ‘Ra’ means energy, ‘dha’ means the one who sustains the energy.

There are many aspects of Easter one has to understand, but the most of all is why did He die and why was He resurrected?

This point I have not yet touched, perhaps, so clearly. That’s the point I want to tell you today. It’s only you people can understand the importance of the life of Christ.

And when it is said that you have to get your realisation through Christ, it means that He had to pierce through the Agnya chakra. He had to be there. If He had not created this gap in the gate, we could never have got realisation.

That is why it is said that you are to pass through the gates of heaven only with the grace of Christ. Of course, that doesn’t mean churches, it doesn’t mean at all churches.

That you understand as sahaja yogis that you have to pass through the Agnya chakra. Ultimately that’s the most difficult point where human beings have to pass. Because, at the Agnya chakra, your ego and superego are fully grown. At the human stage only this ego is developed. Now how to overcome the ego was a point. And to overcome the ego, Christ had to do this.

When He was created in the beginning as Shri Ganesha - you know the story how He was created, that the mala, is the - from the body of Parvati, the Holy Ghost, was taken out, because before Her marriage, She was - She had to cover Herself for Her bath with many scented things. And it was taken out, all these things, and Her vibrations came out. And She created this child just to protect Her chastity; outside Her bathroom She put him. And you know the whole story about it.

Now there was a part of the element of the earth in that child. Pruthvi-tattwa, was there. All other centres - all other centres have got some elements in them. Some elements like pruthvi-tattwa is there, earth element; then you have got water element, then you have got air element, and when you come to this it is the light element, it’s the light.

And at this point, at Agnya chakra, He had to cross the last element, that was the light element. That means He had to come out into the true form of only the Divine Power, the Omkara, the vibrations you can call it; or the absolute - you call it logos or something like that? The first sound, Brahma.

So He had to become the principle of Brahma. To become the principle of Brahma, He had to get rid of all other elements within Him. So the last was also the light element, which He had to cross through.

So He had earth element in Him, as He was of the mala, and all other elements within Him. But when it comes to the Agnya, He had to give up all the elements, that He had to die the death of all these elements that were within Him, to become complete, absolutely pure Spirit.

What He did on subtle form works out on the gross form, and to do that He had to die.

And whatever died in Him, was that little element of earth element and other elements, and what came out of Him was pure Spirit.

[To somebody: “Just move forward.”]

Was pure Spirit that was resurrected; the pure Spirit, the pure Brahma-Tattwa which had formed the body of Christ, which was the body of Christ. And this happening came - Christ has done what was predicted about Him - that He is the saviour, because He passed through that gate to take people from this bodily existence, means the one that depends on the elements, to that existence which is Spirit.

So the resurrection is where you become, from your attention, you jump into the attention of the Spirit. When you feel your attention, when you become the Spirit. That is the happening which has happened to you also.

But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma Tattwa when He was resurrected. And the resurrection is a happening of the Divine Power which came from Mooladhara chakra as just earth element, started growing.

It took its birth from there, came up to Agnya chakra. There Christ was created to pass through all the elements, ultimately to enter into the Sahasrara to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.

And this was a very difficult thing, was very experimental. And the experiment was quite a dangerous one. It could have failed also, because He had in Him that human element, the body element which suffered.

And He suffered, because this body element suffers, not the Spirit; Spirit does not suffer. The body element suffers.

So He had to suffer that body element and to get over it, to get out of it. And to get out of it He had to have a tremendous courage.

It was such a difficult operation. Without Him nobody could have achieved. He knew it was predestined, but it was one of the most difficult things to happen.

I wonder how many Christians know the significance of an egg. Now egg signifies a stage where you are before realisation, when you are in your eggshell; that you are Mr. X, you are Mrs. Y, all that.

But when you mature fully inside, the bird is ready and that is the time you are hatched.

This is the time you get twice born.

So, actually the resurrection of Christ signifies that, and that’s why we give that egg to people saying, “You are an egg”, a reminder of that, and this egg can become the Spirit.

And also it is written that it was an egg when He came. First He was created as an egg. Half of it remained as Shri Ganesha and half of it became Mahavishnu.

Then He came on this earth and He departed with all His elements and the pure vibrations formed His body, and He remained there within all of you, to be awakened. And when the Kundalini takes your attention through that point, there you also become the Spirit.

That’s why He said that, “I’m the gate, I’m the door.” He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.” He said, “I’m the door,” because you cannot become Christ. That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the destination,” that you have to achieve Him. But He has created this space for you.

You can become spiritually awakened; you can become your Spirit.

But Christ is an incarnation, He was the Son of God. And so He is an incarnation, and that incarnation came on this earth just to pull you out of your elements, to make you become the Spirit.

Now how is it that it was the most difficult thing? Because human beings have created in their heads all kinds of artificial barriers.

You see, whatever we think and whatever we do with our mind is all dead, is man-made, is artificial. Because reality is beyond your mind; it is not in your mind. You cannot conceive it; you cannot hold it.

Whatever is in your mind is not the reality, it is beyond.

So, for a human being to accept something that is beyond mind had become so difficult at the time of Christ, because of Romans and all these people coming up. And we are repeating the history again.

They were so ego-oriented, they were so full of ego that to destroy their ego somebody had to do this to create a passage.

By His death so many things are proved, that all those who crucified Him were stupid people, they were ego-oriented, they were blind. They could not see what He was. They could not see what a genuine personality He was. They crucified Him.

I mean, it’s the greatest stupidity.

And they crucified Him, it was all known because these people were so stupid that they would have only crucified Him, what else they could do? Because they couldn’t bear, with their little egos, somebody who is so simple, who is so genuine, who is so true. So they crucified Him and that crucifixion came as a breakthrough for us.

But message for us is the resurrection part. Message for us is the resurrection, and not crucifixion. Crucifixion is not the message, because He’s done it for us. This is the point where Jews must understand.

The other day I was reading - today only - some discussion with the Archbishop of Canterbury took place. And the fellow who was asking him was asking him questions as if he was asking questions to God [laughter].

In a way he said so also that, “I would ask this question to God, that, why is it so many Jews were killed?”

They asked for it. They wanted that they must suffer because they wouldn’t give the credit of suffering to Christ.

They thought, “We all have to suffer.” Ego. It’s ego. “How dare anybody suffer for us? We must suffer separately.”

They couldn’t give that credit to Christ and all the later thinking was that, “We must suffer.” So, whatever you think, comes into action on this gross level, so Mr. Hitler was born and he made them suffer. And the stupidity of human beings is responsible for all the problems that are created on this earth.

The other question was, “How the children get leukemia?” He would ask God, “How children get it?”

If the parents are so frantic and speedy, children have to get it.

If you are not relaxed person when you are married and when you are going to have a baby, you are thinking of divorces and all sorts of nonsense, that franticness will work on the child. Psychologically it is a left-side problem, and the child has to be a patient of leukemia as soon as he is born. That is what it is.

So the problems are created by human beings because of their stupidity.

There is no problem that God has created for you. He’s solved all your problems. All your problems He solves; you have seen in Sahaj Yoga how He solves your little, little problems even. But we create problems for ourselves by our stupidity, by our addiction to elements, to material things, to material habits.

Matter sits on our head. That is on the, we can say, on the level of the earth element.

Then we have other problems like emotional attachments: “This is my daughter; this is my child; this is my; this is mine; I’m so attached to my child.”

Then, “This is my country. This is your country.” We create problem. This Falkland camp... Falkland this thing is an artificial problem, you can see that. I mean, when these people went there, these Spaniards, they all should be driven back to Spain. And all from Brazil should be driven back to Portugal.

What are they doing there if this is the situation? But they are all human beings! What is this territory business? So let human beings live happily wherever they are. What are they going to get out of this territory?

God never created Argentina, Chile, England and all that, He created one homogeneous structure, and it is to look after each other.

Like a heart is created, a liver is created, a brain is created, a nose is created. If they start fighting - say this eye starts fighting this eye.

[Laughter]

We laugh, but we human beings do the same thing. We are all the time doing like this.

This is the stupidity of human beings, which is creating problem. And when you become very stupid, somebody horrible takes advantage of that and comes on this earth just like Hitler, and he tries to put you right.

You don’t need all that. You need only wisdom and your realisation.

And that is what is done today that you have got realisation.

So Easter for sahaj yogis all over the world, is the most important happening, because if it had not happened it would not have been possible to give realisation to people.

I think Gavin will read it out to you later on about what is written about Christ in Devi Mahatmya. This book was written about 14,000 years back by Markandeya.

So imagine, 14,000 years back he knew, being a seer, just like Blake, what was going to happen when Christ was to come.

But He was called as Mahavishnu. He was not Vishnu, He was the son of Vishnu.

And how many Christians understand about Easter? They don’t. They – it’s - Christianity today is nothing but a mental activity, that’s all, which is dead; nonsense it is. Just like any other nonsensical religion, it has become another foolish, stupid religion, which has no meaning. Unless and until you get your realisation, unless and until you feel the vibrations, unless and until you feel this Divine Surrounding Power, how will you understand? Because that’s the only thing that is truth; that’s the only thing that is reality, and unless and until you achieve it, how will you know about Christ? And fighting about Him; how can you fight? I can’t understand really.

To me, it’s stupidity gone to another extreme. By this thing, what you do actually, is to use all these great incarnations to kill each other. Can you imagine? The things that came to elevate you, to make you into higher living are now used, the same things, the names are used to kill each other, to bring down each other.

At the most, if you reach a point where you don’t understand, then they start saying, “It’s a mystery” [laughter]. What is the mystery? In Sahaj Yoga there’s no mystery. It’s all just there. To me, human beings are a mystery [laughter]. I don’t understand them. I can’t understand.

The resurrection of Christ has to now be collective resurrection. This is what is Maha Yoga. Has to be the collective resurrection and for this collective resurrection, first of all sahaj yogis must decide to be collective. Because through Kundalini awakening, you cross, no doubt, you cross through, but you enter an area of collectivity.

And if you do not allow that collectivity to permeate into you, then you come down.

Supposing you become a state beyond the element, the state where you are a collective being; you are aware of the collective being; you are aware that you are a part and parcel of the whole; you are aware that you have to help your nose and your eyes because you are part and parcel of the whole. You reach that stage where you understand that, “I am as important as other cells are, and other cells are to be helped by me and they have to sustain me, we are one.” There should be complete concord.

This awareness comes after realisation, and if you do not understand that this awareness, that this collective awareness is the only way you can stay in that area. Otherwise you get out.

You start having your smaller wells and you just go down into them.

The more you start to expand yourself, you rise higher and then you are again with your badhas or whatever it is.

But if you think that, “I have to live for the whole. I’m responsible for the whole. I’m responsible for creating a nucleus of a cell which is going to look after the whole, and if I fall down the rest also suffers. I have no business to fall down because I have been resurrected to this point. I have entered into the state of collectivity, where my being, which is the Spirit, is the collective being and I have to stay there, I have to be there; I cannot fall, it’s not the way I can live.”

But I have seen after realisation also, people cannot get out of their shells. They still remain in their shell. They cannot spread their wings and sing, and get out of their shell and just fly. They cannot do it.

They still stick on to their small ways of life, in a smaller ways, in every way.

In a holiday you go, you want to have a separate holiday. Why? This is the holiday time, holy-day as they say. Holy day.

This is the holy-day. When you are with other sahaja yogis you are really enjoying the holiday. Where do you enjoy a holiday otherwise? Which is the other way? To be with them is the real holiday.

And that is why one should understand that you should expand your collectivity. If you do not expand your collectivity you are just a waste. You are a wasteful creation of sahaj yogis, which I’m sorry to say, will go down.

Such people show also, in the beginning, gradually they start getting better and better and better. And once you are there in full state, you really enjoy each other’s company without having any fears about them, without having any possessiveness about them, without having any kind of expectation, but just enjoying each other.

That has to happen. Like all our cells in our body are like that. If they can do it, why not we? Because we have so much of sense; at least we think we have more sense than the cells have. At least it is expected, because we have evolved so much from a unicell to this state.

And then you are the epitome of God’s creation; you are the topmost people. Then why not? When you are resurrected, the first thing that should happen to you is to understand that you are no more an individual, but you are a collective being.

You are no more an individual.

All things which make you circumscribe your individuality - throw that away. You are no more an individual. All problems which come to you as individual problems are absolutely useless, false, wasteful. Think of the collective problems. I enjoy such people. Like the other day Fergy was anxious to know about Bristol - which points are there, which are giving vibrations from the Mother Earth. He’s worried about the whole of Bristol - all the Jamaicans, then about the whole Britain - British people, and then of the whole world you should be. That’s what one should think. One should not think, “How will my daughter get married? How can I get a ticket to go there?”

All these nonsensical ideas should be given up because you are now entered into the Kingdom of God and He is going to look after you. Because that state you establish within yourself that you are a collective being.

All other things will drop out. Gradually everybody will be moulded. Even the most difficult I have seen, have improved.

But what about you, the one who is improving everybody else, what about you? How far you are there? How far in your faith that you know that, “I have entered into the Kingdom of God and that every action mine is looked after and guided by His power and I’m aware of it. I’m aware that I have entered into the Kingdom of God which is expressed through my collectivity.”

So collectivity is the nature of a sahaj yogi. And that’s what one has to realise.

May God bless you all.

Is it all right now? Just time [laughter]. How I manage it [laughter], without looking at the watch?

Come forward. There’s some people standing. Come forward. I’ll have some water. First some tea. I mean, all these lectures if you could tape [Hallo, Athena, hallo!] – if you could tape all these and sort of send some of them to France and – or from Lille they have come both of them – and I think it should work out. Because first the people come in, then they disappear. As usual, that’s the common feature, you see. Then gradually they...

Yogi: Mother?

Shri Mataji: [Looks at something aside] It’s lovely.

Yogi: If someone makes a list of Your lectures, what You’ve been speaking about, as it was along which we got one, we can print a list each month on a newsletter, so the people in other centres can write and ask for tapes in writing, ask which wants...

Shri Mataji: That’s a good thing. You must every time I speak you will give it a heading. All that we should. What is it? Is it coming?

Yogi: The radio programme.

Shri Mataji: Ah, is it coming? It’s still time.

Yes, that is important. I agree that we must have a list of things where... You have to give it a title - you see, I have no titles, but you have to give a title. For example what you can say is the Resurrection of Christ, or something about Easter.

Actually you can contact this Bishop of Canterbury. This - you know... Poor man, he is not such a staunch Christian, I feel, the way [Laughter]... I think next time you may write a letter to him, and some of you can go and see him. And Gregoire comes, and three-four people you should ask for a thing. And you should say - today’s, can you get today’s Times? Or if you can telephone to my servant, tell him not to throw today’s newspaper, he’s a good thrower [laughter]. Very good at throwing. Can somebody telephone to him? Is a phone here available? John?

Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral of Saint-Albans.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral of Saint-Albans. You know? He was there when You were there.

Gavin: When You were in St. Albans, when Djamel was living at St. Alban, You visited there, he was the bishop there. That time.

Yogi: He was the bishop there.

Shri Mataji: How was he?

Yogi: I didn’t know him at that time, but soon after You visited, he got promoted [general laughter].

Shri Mataji (smiles): Really? Good idea!

So we can write to him. [Yogi: Yes] I might have met him there also, possibly. Might have seen him.

[Yogi: “It’s quite possible, yes”]

Gavin, you have to collect my passport tomorrow. All right? Then I would say, on 5th of May, if you people could collect some money for this building. That’s a good day, when you can give it to me, or to Gregoire [Yogi: Yes], and we can put that money in the bank, we have opened now an account for that. Any amount that people want to give, and the first amount – and also Lille people wanted to give some money. I told them that’s for our, you should give it for our building account, because we have to have a building now, it’s absolutely eminent.

Before I go back, you could have money for which you can also tell Warren that this is what is decided.

Then the first amount should go on the 5th, would be a good idea. And I’ve got the account number also, so you can send it in the name of Gregoire, and the account number I’ll give it to you. If you want, it should be all right.

Gavin: May I ask You to find out how many people are about to go to Paris from here?

Shri Mataji: Now. Now, for Paris, the thing is, it is on Tuesday, the programme is on Tuesday. And she has arranged that we go to Lille on Sunday. So if you come to Lille on Sunday, after the programme, if you want, you all can go to Paris, and stay in the ashram there. Or is it possible in Lille? Is there any place where we can take it on rent for a night somewhere?

Yogi: No problem, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Yogi: No problem.

Shri Mataji: No problem? Sure? [Laughter]

Yogi: There’s definitely place.

Shri Mataji: All right, so one night you can stay in Lille. Will be good idea.

Yogi: If there are enough people we could also take a bus.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogi: We could take a bus to travel.

Shri Mataji: Good.

Yogi: If there are enough people, we just have to find out how many want to get there.

Shri Mataji: Now, from Lille then we go to Paris. In Paris you have a big place to the... that will be the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday we have this Puja, in the morning time perhaps, and I would like to come back if possible on the 6th. If 5th is all right, all right, otherwise 6th you can put it.

Somebody is working it out in Brussels! Did you write to that doctor? [Yogi: “Yes, Mother...”] Good. Have you kept his address? [Yogi: Yes...]

I think on Gavin I put too much pressure also sometimes. Somebody must try to share that also. And you should find out. It’s easy to telephone to him, I know his number very well [laughter]. But you can find out, all of you, if he needs any help.

Magda, sometimes you can telephone to him [Magda: “Yes, Shri Mataji”], and find out if he needs any help, for writing some letters or something, and also for typing anything – anybody who wants to help him, you see, it’s essential, because I trouble him quite a lot [laughter]. And also you have a little account for sending letters and things, and for telephones, a little account can be made.

Everybody should - now, because we are expanding, we have to have a proper system by which we work it out. So many letters come to me every day, and I’m so lazy, I just can’t... I don’t know [Shri Mataji laughs]. I think if I write now, then another will come tomorrow, so I wait for a while. Then I - but my attention is there. If you write to me, I’m very happy because I know what is happening. But don’t write very long letters, you know [laughter, Shri Mataji laughs]. I like, I enjoy them, but if they are too long, then, you know, the main thing is left out.

We have to be to the point and properly with the protocol and all that.

There’s one gentleman who writes to me regularly from India. His name is Mr. Brahme, Mr. Brahme. And he writes only two sentences: one is that, “Mother, please bless me that I will be a good sahaja yogi”, “Mother, please bless the whole world that they become sahaja yogis, and the Sahaja Yoga spreads, and your most loving son at Your Lotus Feet, so and so.” That’s all [Shri Mataji laughs].

Every - regularly, I must have so many letters from him, that’s all. It’s good after all: whenever you write praise and all that it’s good. But sometimes you know, we go on writing – like one gentleman has written, “I’ve been working for two years, I’ve done everything, I’ve done nimbu, I’ve done this, I’ve done this, I’ve done that and I’ve not felt the vibrations”, you see.

But the list of things he gave, you see, made me laugh really [Shri Mataji laughs, laughter]: “Oh My, you must be fed up!” [Laughter]

And the simple thing he is doing wrong, which people didn’t understand that is he is doing Gayatri mantra. If you do Gayatri mantra, it doesn’t work out. I mean, this is so common, I mean, while we are here, Gayatri mantra if people have done, their right side is so much horrible, and it doesn’t work out at all. So you have to neutralise it with Lord’s Prayer, and with forgiveness to others, with the right hand towards the photograph and left hand outside. And never to say Gayatri mantra again, you see? But that’s what it is. But these small, small things people don’t notice when I’m treating others. And I don’t know how to talk about it, one by one, because when it comes before me, I know the solution.

So it’s better that you people note it down what Mother does at that time. Now this Gayatri mantra is one of the worst curses on human beings, I think. It is so right-sided. An Indian, if he does Gayatri mantra, he becomes ten times worse that any westerner.

Think of it.

Now, can you read it? Now is it started?

[The yogis are waiting for a radio broadcast about Sahaja Yoga]

Yogis (several voices together): Somebody has to set the frequency... The right frequency for ...

Shri Mataji: Why not start the radio?

Yogi: I think everything’s on.

Shri Mataji: Is there no radio there? (Yogi: “Yes, Mother.”) What’s happening?

[A radio is heard]

Shri Mataji: Loudly, I can’t hear.

Yogi: It begins after five, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Is it? More loudly. [On the radio some people can be heard speaking about churches. Shri Mataji and sahaja yogis laugh] [To somebody] Is it yours? [Yogi (barely audible): “No, Mother... it’s a hour-long programme, Mother...”.] All right, all right.

[Yogi: “You see, we didn’t take all of it...”] That’s better. You have to go through all nonsense to listen to some sense of that. Gavin, what have you got? You read the Bible, I think?

Gavin: Yes. It’s a very appropriate psalm we’ve discovered, Mother, very short...

Shri Mataji: Must be, must be.

Gavin: ... for the ashrams.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Gavin: It’s for the ashrams.

Shri Mataji: Lovely.

Gavin: “Psalm 133. (1) Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! (2) It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; (3) As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore”.

Shri Mataji: See? Very beautiful you found out, I must say. Now what is it? Devi Mahatmya you read it out.

[GAVIN HAVING STARTED READING FROM THE “SRIMAD DEVI BHAGAVATAM,” BOOK 9, CHAPTER 3]

Gavin: “Narayana said:– ‘O Devarshi! The egg (born of Mula Prakriti) that was floating in the waters for a period equal to the life period of Brahma, now in the fullness of time separated into two parts. Within that egg there was a powerful child, lustrous like one thousand millions of suns.”

Shri Mataji: Suns. See.

Gavin: “This child could not suck Mother’s milk as it was forsaken by Her. So, being tired of hunger, the child, for a moment, cried repeatedly”.

Shri Mataji: Forsaken because He had to grow!

Gavin: “The child that will become the lord of countless Brahmandas (universes) -”

Shri Mataji: Countless Brahmandas. Brahmandas are universes.

Gavin: “...now an orphan having no father nor mother began to look upwards from the waters. This boy came to be denominated afterwards by the name of Maha Virat when He became gross and grosser.

As there is nothing finer than radium, so there is nothing grosser than Maha Virat. The power of this Maha Virat, one-sixteenth of that of Shri Krishna, the Highest Self. But this boy...”

Shri Mataji: That is Yehova.

Gavin: “...But this boy, (born of the Prakruti Radha), is the Sole Stay of all this Universe”...

Shri Mataji: Sole Stay.

Gavin: “... He is denominated by the name Maha Vishnu. In his every pore countless universes are existing. So much so that even Shri Krishna could not count them. If it were possible to count the number of dust particles, it is impossible to count the number of the universes. So there are endless Brahmas, Vishnus, and Maheshwaras. In every Brahmanda, there is Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha. Each Brahmanda extends from Patala to the Brahmaloka. The abode of Vaikuntha is higher than that (that is, it is situated outside of Brahmanda), again the abode of Goloka is fifty koti yojanas (that is 50 x 10 x 4 x 2 million miles) higher than Vaikuntha.

This Goloka Dhama is eternal and real as Shri Krishna is eternal and real. This world composed of seven islands is surrounded by the seven oceans. Forty-nine Upa Dvipas (smaller islands adjacent to them) exist here.

Besides there are countless mountains and forests. Higher than this earth is the Brahmaloka with seven heavens, and below this, are the seven Patalas. This is the bounding limit of Brahmanda. Just above this earth there is the Bhurloka, above is Bhuvaloka, then Swahaloka, then Janahloka, then Tapahloka, then Satyaloka, and above that ...”

Shri Mataji: Mahaloka. Mahaloka not there? Maha.

Gavin: Brahmaloka.

Shri Mataji: Bhur, Bhuvah, Swaha. They call it Brahma.

Gavin: Bhur, Bhuva, Swaha.

Shri Mataji: Swaha, Tapah.

Gavin: Janah.

Shri Mataji: Janah. Tapah.

Gavin: Satya and Brahmaloka. “The splendor of Brahmaloka is like that of molten gold [Shri Mataji assents]. But all the substances whether outside or inside this Brahmaloka, are transient.

When this Brahmanda dissolves, everything dissolves and is destroyed. All are temporary like bubbles of water. Only Goloka and Vaikuntha are eternal. In every pore of this Maha Virat is existing one Brahmanda. What to speak about...”.

Shri Mataji: Hm. Pore means any – every – what you call this, pore of the skin. One Brahmanda exists in Christ. [Aside] Thank you.

Gavin: “What to speak of others when even Krishna cannot count the number of these Brahmandas. [Shri Mataji laughs] In every Brahmanda there is Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha. O Child Narada! In every Brahmanda, the number of the gods is three kotis or 30 millions. Some of them are the Dikpatis (the Regents of the quarters); some are the Dikpalas (the Rulers of the quarters), some are asterisms, and some are planets.

In the Bhurloka, there are four Varnas (Brahmins, etc.,) and in the Patalas there are Nagas. Thus the Universe exists composed of moveable and non-moveable things. (This is Brahmanda Vivriti). O Nârada! Now the Virat Purusha began to look up to the skies again and again but He could not see anything within that egg except the void. Then distressed with hunger He cried out repeatedly and became merged in anxiety. Next moment getting back His consciousness, He began to think of Krishna, the Highest Person and saw there at once the eternal light of Brahma. He saw there His form as deep blue like new rain-cloud; with two bands [Original text reads “hands”], garment of a yellow color, sweet smile on His face, flute in His hand and He seemed to be very anxious to show His Grace to Devotees. Looking at the Lord, His Father, the boy became glad and smiled.

The Lord, the bestower of boon, granted Him boons appropriate for that moment.

Oh child, let you possess knowledge like me, let your hunger and thirst vanish: let you ...”

Shri Mataji: See. Hunger and thirst vanish. He fasted for forty days. See, all the indications are there.

Gavin: “...let you be the holder of innumerable Brahmandas till the time of Pralaya (the universal dissolution). Be without any selfishness, be fearless and the bestower of boons to all. Let not old age, death, disease, sorrow or any other ailings afflict thee.”

Shri Mataji: This is a sign of a Brahma Shakti. He Himself has said before that the Brahma Shakti, or the Spirit does not die, does not get old and all that, and He is telling him all that.

Gavin: “Thus saying, He repeated thrice on his ear the six-lettered great Mantra “Om Krishnaya Swaha” worshipped by the Vedas with their Amgas, the Giver of desires and the destroyer of all troubles and calamities. O Brahma’s Son! Thus giving the mantra, Shri Krishna arranged for His feeding thus.

In every universe whatever offerings will be given to Shri Krishna, one sixteenth of that will go to Narayana, the Lord of Vaikuntha, and fifteen sixteenth is to go to this boy the Virat. Shri Krishna...”

Shri Mataji [laughing]: He is Narayana also, Shri Krishna is Narayana, you see. So one sixteenth will go to Narayana and fifteen sixteenth to His son.

Gavin: “Shri Krishna did not allot any share for Himself. Himself transcending all the Gunas, full, He is always satisfied with Himself. What necessity is there for any further offerings? Whatever the people offer with devotion, the Lord of Lakshmi, the Virat eats all these. Bhagavan Shri Krishna giving thus to the Virat the boon and the mantra, said, “Oh child, say what more you desire. I will give you that instantly.” The Virat boy hearing thus the words of Shri Krishna spoke. “O, Thou Omnipresent, I have got no desires whatsoever, save this that as long as I live, whether for a short time or for a long time, let me have pure bhakti towards Thy Lotus Feet.”

Shri Mataji: That’s why always Christ has these fingers like this [Shri Mataji shows second and third finger of right hand], one denoting towards Shri Krishna and another towards Vishnu.

He’s talked of His Father throughout. “For a short time or for a long time”: He lived for a short time and for a long time.

Gavin: “‘In this world he is Jivanmukta (liberated whilst living) who is your Bhakta; and that bewildered fool is dead while living who is devoid of any Bhakti to Thee. What needs he to perform Japam, asceticism, sacrifice, worship, holding fasts and observances, going to sacred places of pilgrimages and other virtuous acts if he be without any bhakti to Shri Krishna? Vain is his life who is devoid of any devotion to Shri Krishna, under Whose Grace he has obtained his life and Whom he does not now pay homage and worship. He is endowed with Shakti as long as Atma resides in his body; no sooner the Atma departs from his body all the Shaktis accompany him.

O Great One! And Thou art the Universal Atman who transcends Prakriti, Who is All will, the Primeval Person -”

Shri Mataji: See?

Gavin: “...and of the nature of the Highest Light. O Child!” Thus saying, the Virat boy remained silent. Shri Krishna then spoke in sweet words, “Oh child, let you remain as fresh as ever like Me. You will not have any fall even if innumerable Brahmas pass away.

Let you divide yourself in parts and turn into smaller Virats in every universe.”

Shri Mataji: That’s what He did.

Gavin: “Brahma will spring from Your navel and will create the cosmos. From the forehead of that Brahma will spring eleven Rudras for the destruction of the creation.”

Shri Mataji: See. [Shri Mataji smiles]

Gavin: “But they will all be parts of Shiva.”

Shri Mataji: That is given by Shiva to Him. You see, the eleven parts are given to this child by Shiva.

Gavin: “The Rudra named Kalagni, of these eleven Rudras, will be the destroyer of all this Vishvas (the cosmos). Besides, from each of your sub-divisions, the Vishnu will originate and that Bhagavan Vishnu will be the Preserver of this Vishvu world.

I say that under My favour you will always be full of bhakti towards Me and no sooner you meditate on Me, you will be able to see My lovely form. There is no doubt in this; and your Mother, Who resides in My breast, will not be difficult for you to see.”

Shri Mataji: Better to see [Shri Mataji smiles].

Gavin: “Let you remain here in ease and comfort. I now go to Goloka.” Saying thus Shri Krishna, the Lord of world, disappears.

Shri Mataji: See, it’s so clear cut. Better send it to this Archbishop of Canterbury [laughter].

What does he understand about Christ?

That every pore of His skin is one Brahmanda. So He became very gross, you see, in the sense that He came down on this earth, you see, and then He became the Spirit. That’s why it is said, His “only Son.”

Yogi: Mother?

Shri Mataji: What is happening? Nothing?

Yogi: Mother, may I read something for You?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

Yogi: Paul, Paul Duncan and I have written this.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: Paul Duncan and I have written this for You. It’s called “Resurrection Sunday.”

“We wandered lost in this confused age /

You came to us like rain to a scorched plain /

We made so many foolish mistakes /

But You laughed and loved us even more. /

We walked always seeking Messiah’s return /

And then You came with open arms. /

We closed our hearts and ran our love dry /

And You refreshed us with cooling Grace. /

Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

You wash our troubles away. /

Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

You are opening our flowers. /

We struggled hard inside our shells /

You took the eggs and made the doves. /

We cried for love and forgot how to be /

You wiped our tears and make us see. /

We needed the fulfillment of Christ’s words /

And then Mother Mary, You gave us true second birth. /

We languished in our man-made tombs /

Divine Redeemer, You rolled away the stone. /

Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

You wash all troubles away. /

Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

You open all the flowers.”

Shri Mataji (smiling): So beautiful, I think. Very beautiful. It’s like a mantra working on my vibrations.

So now all our programmes are fixed for different days, and now I have received a letter from – again from him, Jim, saying that he would like to have a programme from the 15th of June now. And I personally think that he has put last two days – one day to Norwich, and then one day in Cambridge, then Norwich, I think 17th is Cambridge, 18th Norwich and again Cambridge, and then Puja. Best is to keep two days in Cambridge – first Norwich, that will be - what date did I tell you to have Norwich?

Yogi: The 18th, Jai Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: 18th should be Norwich, 19th and 20th Cambridge, and 21st will be the Puja. All right? Just change that much, otherwise it’s perfectly alright.

What else? Kevin, how are you?

Yogi: Sorry, Shri Mataji...

Shri Mataji: Hot? Very hot?

Yogi: No, I was late, I didn’t have time to change my clothes.

Shri Mataji: You are all right! [Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs]. You are all right. You see, when the Mother has seen you in your “birthday suits” [laughter], why should you worry about any dress with your Mother? [Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs] – isn’t it? [Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs]

There is no formality with the Mother [Shri Mataji laughs]. It’s all right, She likes to see you properly clad, but there’s nothing, no formality. [Aside, to somebody:] Thank you, that’s all, thank you very much. [To the yogi] But you look serious, that’s what I want to know.

Yogi: Oh, I’m worried whether the Divine is coming through on the tape. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

Yogi: Because I don’t know!

Shri Mataji: Yes, I was wondering what’s the matter, why are you so serious – no, I just thought, maybe because now you are married and you are thinking of a married life now [general laughter], what to do, and - No? No problems?

Yogi: No, no.

Shri Mataji: You see, when you even tell somebody, “You have to get married”, suddenly they ... [Shri Mataji makes a worried expression], as if somebody has stuck a pistol! [Shri Mataji laughs, laughter] That’s the first reaction I have seen many-a-times.

Pat has not come today?

Yogini: No, Grazyna is not very well, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Hmm?

Yogini: Grazyna is still not very well...

Shri Mataji: I know, poor thing.

Yogini: They’d like to come and see You next week...

Shri Mataji: I have told - her problem is basically something different, and I have told the solution and I’ve asked Gavin, Gavin to find out. Did you ask Sarah?

Gavin: I didn’t get the chance just yet.

Shri Mataji: But Sarah is here, you can talk to her. You see, we have a, we had a doctor in India called Dr. Shirolkar, and he devised an operation – you might have heard his name [Yogini comments probably on name, Shri Mataji: “Ah”] – to strengthen the ...- [She hears a baby crying: “Who is crying so much? Just see the child”] – the lower wall, the lower wall of the uterus, you see?

And that operation somebody must be doing here also, I’m sure.

Yogini: Yes, she had it.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogini: She had it done.

Shri Mataji: She had that operation?

Yogini: She did, but it’s still... she still...

Shri Mataji: No, but then she conceived very early then. [Yogini: “Sorry?”] You have to wait after that to develop into a proper... she had that kind of an operation, did she?

Yogini: I think she did it, yes.

Shri Mataji: Then she should have waited to see that the wall is fully developed, I think if she had allowed to - I’m going to work out something else for her. You can have another layer just to make it strong, you see?

[Yogini: “Yes.”]

Any other problems? [To a yogini] How are you now? Gail? All right? Don’t do any heavy work, but walking is good. In Regent Park, you can go in the morning for a walk, not in (unclear word) but it’s a good place to walk about little bit.

[To another yogini] How are you? Why don’t you sit on a chair, will be better, better. Better sit down on a chair. Go. Go there, to sit down. So how are you? [Yogini: “I’m all right...”] Good. I’m happy you could come. I’m happy you could come.

Received any letter? He is telephoning me, he is telling me that he is trying to get the permission and this and that, he’s going to write to me again. His style is like this. You see, he doesn’t want to talk about it unless he really gets the permission.

Yogini: I wrote to him.

Shri Mataji: You’ve written to him, yes. He telephones to me. All suspiciousness, you see, because he is in the Air Force, and the government is suspicious of foreigners, you see, marrying any Air Force this thing, you see. I just don’t understand. So I would say take my passport, you have to walk like a criminal with your passport number, this, that [laughter], and you have to get my visas in Rome and these places.

But I think he can do it, Dinesh knows how to do it. Tell him to go to Varad, Varad Rajan, he’ll give him, because is a diplomatic passport.

How are you now, Kay, are you better? Hm.

Bala, what about your chickenpox? [Shri Mataji laughs, laughter] Gone?

Bala: It’s gone.

Shri Mataji: Djamel, how are you?

Djamel: I’ve got the Agnya problem.

Shri Mataji: Agnya? On the day of Resurrection Agnya should clear out. Somebody has done everything for us, you see? Best is to rely on that, all done!

What, so why should we worry?

Hm, better. Hm. Everything is done for you, I mean, lucky people I must say. [Laughter]

Like guests, you see? That till, all others have to do everything for you, and you have the fruits of it.

Isn’t it? A good situation. But still you look so worried. [Laughter] As we say, there’s a dog walking under a cart. He looks very worried because he thinks he is carrying the cart, you see. And the poor – the one, one, the bullocks which are pulling the cart are quite happy. [Laughter] Better now?

Is it true that in Islam they hate dogs?

Yogi: No, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No? No. They don’t hate dogs. In Iran they – I don’t know why they hate dogs so much. Somebody was telling me that they ill-treat dogs, absolutely. I said, “Surprising it is.”

Yogi: Same in Malaysia.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogi: They are not well treated, animals in general are not well treated.

Shri Mataji: They?

Yogi: They are very badly treated, You know?

Shri Mataji: Badly treated. Because, you see, they have become little insensitive to animals, I think so. Like here people treat the dogs very kindly, but their children very unkindly [laughter]. Is the other way round.

I mean, it’s - just don’t understand, it’s a mystery as I said. [Shri Mataji laughs, laughter].

Those who want to see me, can come. Tomorrow evening I’ll be at home. All right? About, say, six o’clock. Then Sahasrara Puja must be fixed in the evening, so that everybody can make it.

Say about seven o’clock, that would be good. Many people can come there – evening because it’s a Wednesday or something. It’s a Wednesday? [Gavin: “Yes”] So Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday- Friday, perhaps?

Gavin: No, it’s a Wednesday.

Shri Mataji: It’s a Wednesday? [Gavin assents] Are you sure? [Gavin assents] Because if second is Tuesday...

Gavin: No, second is Sunday.

Shri Mataji: Hm? Second is Tuesday.

Gavin: No, it’s Sunday.

Shri Mataji: Is a Sunday. Then it’s all right, Wednesday. So one should try to have it about seven o’clock, so that others can come in for the puja.

Now, is it over? Or...

Yogi: ... John Glower is here, and he’s supposed to be ...

Shri Mataji: Where is he? So we can start the puja business because otherwise it will get very late. All right? [Yogi: “Yes.”]

When you, when you get it...

[A radio interview of a sahaja yogi about Sahaja Yoga is broadcast on the radio, and listened to by Shri Mataji and the other sahaja yogis.]

Yogi: ...called Sahaja. Sahaja comes from Indian language and it means “born with you”, or “spontaneous”, because essentially Yoga isn’t just something that allows to keep fit as has become in the West now.

Yoga means union, union of your Self and your Spirit, or of your Spirit and the Great Spirit, which is the Divine, or God (...).

And in that in fact your Spirit – which again people nowadays don’t even know exists, most of them usually feel embarrassed when you talk about souls and Spirit, in fact is a reality.

It is that within which is the true nature, its qualities are pure bliss, pure consciousness and truth. And if one can experience that Spirit consciously, then obviously one can be a very blissful person and not have the problems that most people have. The question is: how do you get it?

And Sahaja means it is spontaneous, in other words something now for the first time has made spontaneous Self-Realization, or knowing yourself fully possible for the first time.

Interviewer: You say “something”. Just what is this something?

Yogi: This something is the fact that in the sacrum bone, which is the bone at the base of the spine, is a being, that we call Kundalini, people in the East call it as Kundalini. The Christians also have come across it, but they called it Holy Spirit. Jesus has talked about it too. And ...

Interviewer: The fact that the Christians would...(...) that it is in the bone, they wouldn’t like.

Yogi: No, they wouldn’t, no, they wouldn’t but nevertheless Christ talked about it, that’s the essential thing, not that the Christians would necessarily; but rather what Christ said. Now, somehow this being, which is the Divine inside, has to link up the individual Spirit - we say the Atma, the personal Spirit - with the One, the Divine, right? And the way that happens is that the Kundalini rises up the spine, enlightens Spirit, and pierces – it goes to actually seven subtle centres called chakras – which I will tell about in a minute if you like – until it pierces the fontanel bone on top of the head, this top chakra, the top center.

When that happens, the personal spiritual reality inside, which is the Spirit and the subtle centres and the Kundalini, which is latent if you like Divine power within, all are brought into the conscious nervous system for the first time.

Interviewer: If this is there, or has been there all the time, why is it that it hasn’t happened before?

Yogi: Why it hasn’t happened before, well, it happened before in a few cases, there have been enlightened people who were great saints, people with immense courage and spiritual power who did have their Self-Realisation before, I mean you could say that Lord Buddha was a man who, because of his great perfection, attained his spiritual life, in other words the Kundalini came up fully, and he was totally as we’d say God-realised, in other words he became a hollow personality flowing as if played through, his ego just went, as well as his conditionings went, and he was just as the Spirit.

And now it happens to anybody, and this is the main thing, this is the interesting, exciting and thoroughly enjoyable thing; but now, it isn’t a case that just a few sages go and live on a mountain in a pure, absolutely perfect knowledge may at the end of all [unclear] time get their Self-Realisation: now, any of us who desire it, any of us who are seeking it, genuine seekers can get their Self-Realisation.

And the reason for that is that an Indian lady, called Mataji, Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi, has come absolutely foremost to give this gift of Self-Realisation, by which – not that She is a guru who has come just to, you know, have people sit at Her feet, and pay money and so on; on the contrary, She said you can’t pay for the Divine, you can’t pay for your Yoga, your Union with your Spirit and God.

It happens spontaneously, and the reason it happens, is because in Her presence vibrations which come from Her, or even from the photograph of Her, come in through the upper side of the hands, and that acts as a trigger for the Kundalini which is residing, which as you say we don’t know about, which may have been there – is there nevertheless whether we know about it or not - at the base of the spine. This rises up and that cool breeze, what you feel as cool breeze in your hands, all right? Vibrations flowing from Mataji in full-fledged form – the Kundalini then comes up and you begin to feel things in your...

Interviewer: There are many people that - do you know that the real fact is, and I have to say this...

Yogi: Yes.

Interviewer: ...is that there are lots and lots of people who are saying very similar types of things; and also lots of people, let’s have it, just... (indistinct words) you know. What’s the difference between this one and the rest?

Yogi: Right. There are lots of differences, but admittedly, because of the age we’re living in, because there are so many things around, some of which have been absolutely proved by psychologists and other people, just intelligent people, to be absolutely dangerous and damaging to people.

That has to tell you the difference difference, you have to have a discernment. Discernment, as I said beforehand is that you have to judge Mataji, you have to judge Sahaja Yoga on what you feel about it I suppose, right? Before your Realisation. And also using consent. But Mataji’s message is this: you can’t pay for the Divine, absolutely not, it’s satanic to try and pay for the Divine.

Secondly, if a thing is genuine, you are not going to get bad side effects, you are not going to feel ill: if a thing is holy and is good and pure you’ll feel good; and it will be obvious in your whole personality... (indistinct words). And equally, you can’t come to this spiritual Realisation, or God you could say, or your Spirit or the truth, you can’t come to that on a path which is unrighteous, you can’t come to that on a path of unholiness, of immorality, or of extreme behaviour.

Interviewer: But you know, there are lots of others who tell exactly the same words Then  what’s the difference between yourselves and say Raja Yoga? Now they don’t get money either.

Yogi: The fact is that we have the actual happening, which you can feel inside yourself, you feel the cool breeze. When you get Realisation, and anybody gets it - you don’t have to pay for it - you feel the cool breeze in your hands coming from the picture or from Mataji. As soon as you actually feel, and you have to verify for yourself, and you might say “there’s a cool breeze”, doesn’t make a cool breeze; but if you feel the cool breeze you can’t really deny it.

Secondly, you feel cool which comes out of your head, when you get Realisation, not before. Thirdly, you begin to feel all this extremely subtle, very sensitive and beautifully made creation which is the human personality. You begin to feel its subtleties.

Interviewer: Where does this all lead us? Where is it going to take us?

Yogi: It takes us into the future, absolutely, or you could say into the present; it takes you to yourself. When the Kundalini goes through the second to the top chakra - the sixth chakra, you come into the present and you enter a state of thoughtless awareness, spontaneously.

It’s absolutely natural, it just happens, when the Kundalini reaches that point. The reason for that is that, suppose you are thinking, you can’t possibly be in the present, you can’t be aware of the actually present. You can be aware of just what’s just passed, or what’s going to happen in a very short time, but you can’t be aware of the absolute present.

So the only way to be in the present, absolutely, is to be thoughtless, and the Kundalini does this, when it crosses that point on the forehead. Then you just become thoughtlessly aware and we are in that state all the time. All we do is in that state.

It sounds strange, but it’s a reality. The cares go, the troubles go, your problems go, as these chakras get cleared out by the Kundalini rising up, it clears out all the awful things that cause the problems; and you become in the end a joyful being.

Interviewer: And should you be interested, She is holding a meeting at Caxton Hall on Wednesday the fourteenth of April at 7pm, everyone is welcome.

[The yogis cheer and applaud the broadcast.]

Shri Mataji: Ah? Now, the one point that’s very important to be said on such interview, you see, is that you become empowered by your own powers. You yourself know, you can feel it, the other person, you can feel yourself and you know how to maneuver, you see, this Kundalini of others; you can give Realisations to others; you can cure others; your power is released. Your power of your Spirit is released on your central nervous system.

That would be really convincing; that is not my power, it’s your own power you can feel.

Yogini: Mother, it seems, through talking of other groups, they do all say very much the same as we do, but the only thing that we should say – really has to be convincingly - is that we do have such powers.

Shri Mataji: That’s it.

Yogini: That’s it.

Shri Mataji: Just talking is very easy.

You see, if read some books, they talk. See, they read a Sahaj Yoga book, they can say, “I have a Kundalini awakening. I can see the chakras. I can...”

All right, say!

Ask them, “Can you feel our chakras?”

[Yogi: “That’s all.”] That’s all. Then what do they agree? Then what do they say; are they going to come?

Yogini: Some of them have done, yes, Mother, we were...

Shri Mataji: I think you should go and meet them, again and again. [Yogini: “Yes, Mother.”] You see, Amar Samati asked – he went to Santa Cruz, absolutely a new place. And he met people and talked to them and told them, “See, you are not feeling anything, why are you adhering to any group, for what? For paying money? For what? Because you have been doing it, but you are not feeling any vibrations, nothing; you are not feeling anything, you have no powers.”

And he convinced them.

And he said, “There will be at least five to six hundred people,” and there were – more than that, for that programme.

That’s what you have to go and tell them, “What have you got? You haven’t got any powers. We have, we can feel you. We know this is what, this is your chakra is here, that is there.” That’s the thing.

Yogini: Mother, there is a very funny story, we went to see some Buddhists, and I asked one of them (...) what enlightenment was.

Shri Mataji: Hm.

Yogini: And he gave me a very flurry answer. And I said to him, “Do you think you will get it in this lifetime?” And he says: “Oh I don’t know, I think it might be possible.”

And I said, “Well, how would you know it when you get it?”

He said, “Oh, I suppose it will dawn on me one day.” And as he said that, his Kundalini came up! [The yogini laughs, laughter]

Shri Mataji: It will what, it will what?

Yogini: He said, “I suppose it will dawn on me one day.” And as he said it his Kundalini came up [Shri Mataji laughs, laughter].

Shri Mataji: Good.

I’m also sending – you see these... Somehow, with my husband’s job, I meet people who are seekers and who are placed at the helm of affairs. I’m sending them books, you see? And I want to send one of the, one of our books, to Indonesia. There’s an ambassador from Indonesia who’s very anxious, so he has been writing to my husband that, “You haven’t sent the book as yet.” So we’ll have to send it there.

Yogini: Mother, Warren has sent this cassette up, it’s the first VHS copy of the... (inaudible audio)

Shri Mataji: Oh all right, let’s see. Can we see here?

I don’t know what nail paint these people have put, I don’t know. Indian. Doesn’t go with any English nail paint remover. Can you believe it? Shines, though...

I’ll just come back from - It’s a good one, no doubt. And it’s come out very well.

[Shri Mataji stands up]

[PAUSE IN RECORDING]

...and also it shakes a little bit, but doesn’t matter, we can’t help it, you see, because originals we have in any case and, but these must be transferred. But all the new ones should be done on VHS, you see. That’s a better new system to use, you see?

That’s a better idea I think, than to use the, that one and then transfer it.

It’s quite good, I mean, as far as ... I mean, it gives - it fits all right, but could be better if you have direct. But as it is we don’t want them to be lost, everybody would like to hear, and some of them are very powerful in Houston and all that. Have you got Houston one here?

Gavin: There is at least one Houston, Mother, I don’t know where it is now, maybe Warren will send.

Shri Mataji: Alright, so ask him to send some Houston things for people to see, they were very powerful. Specially on Christ I spoke very well. And why don’t you send this one to Houston people, the one on the Easter day, will be good idea, you see?

And if he wants to hear also, Mr. Tricky Fellow, he could, you see. No wonder, because of pressures on him, you see? You see, that is being a cult, it will become a cult, Unity Church will become a cult once he starts tolerating everything. Just write to him that, “You’ll become a cult then, you don’t become a living church. The living things know how to discard, what to accept.”

Please sit down.

Yogi: Excuse me, Mother, is this light disturbing You?

Shri Mataji: This is what?

Yogi: Do you mind this light on?

Shri Mataji: I didn’t see it!

Yogi: Oh. [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: I think this gives a better picture.

Yogi: It does.

Shri Mataji: It does. Yes. [Puja begins] You can get people from say Lille have come, who else from – London, you see, the new people, if they don’t come forward, then how will I know them, you see, some of the new people whom I’ve not met should come forward, you see, will be good idea.

You must tell your names to me and... [Yogi: “Gary”]. What’s it? [Yogi: “Gary”] Gareth. [Yogi: “Gary”] Gary, Gary, all right. Gary.

Anybody else from Lille? Patrick, you can come along. You come along – now, what’s your name? Christopher. Christopher I don’t know. Christopher and Gary. Now, who else is there? A new one? Come along. Patrick you come, and you come along. You also come, because you’ve come from outside.

Hilary, is it all right? You’ve changed a little bit, is it all right? [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”] Little bit, because you see, it’s no use going up and down [Yogini: “Yes”], so is best is to finish with Norwich, [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”] and then be in Cambridge [Yogini: “Yes”].

Yogini: Mother, did I understand you were going to spend two evenings in Cambridge, and then the puja the following day.

Shri Mataji: Yes. [Yogini: “Or is it one evening?”] No, no, that’s how, that’s how, that’s what it is. [Yogini: “Two programmes”] 18th at Norwich [Yogini: “Yes”] and 19th and 20th Cambridge [Yogini: “Yes”], and 21st the Puja. 21st is a Sunday, isn’t it?

Yogini: I hope so, Mother, yes.

Shri Mataji: I hope so, [Yogini: “Yes”] because you see, some people will have to come from here for Puja. [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”] Just find out, is it a Sunday, 21st? All right. Come along, come forward.

Yogi: No, it’s a Monday.

Shri Mataji: Ah. I would say David, you come along, David Prole, please come along, to wash my feet. And Kay, Kay? The other Kay, come along, yes. Good.

And Samson, where is he? Oh... [Laughter] I call him Samson, his name is Simon I always call him Samson [laughter]. I can’t forget Samson, you know, nobody is a Samson here, just imagine!

Yogi: Caleb, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: Caleb. [Shri Mataji laughs] Caleb’s the one, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Who? [Yogis: “Caleb”] He is Samson? Who is Samson?

Yogi: Magda’s son, Caleb.

Shri Mataji: Caleb is Samson? [Laughter] I didn’t know! [Shri Mataji laughs].

So Maria, what is it now, next year will you do for Greece, hm?

Maria: Next year, as You wish Mother, we can do it this year if You like.

Shri Mataji: [Laughing] I think it’s too early. We’ll have to go, prepare, do something there...

Maria: We have to go at least one month in advance, Mother, before You come, to prepare something.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Maria: And then we’ll have to stay after ... in order to establish something.

Shri Mataji: You’ll have to stick on there. Maria: I have written to Maria (Fujami?) and I have not received an answer yet, inviting her to come over here.

Shri Mataji: That’s what I’m saying.

Now come along, you both can wash my feet first of all. One by one, so this space is given to others to also come along.

You just move on. Let it be now, it’s not ready, just good, you see, you can put it on one side, this one put it on the here. Now you can light it. You both come along first of all to wash my feet.

Now what I’m saying, somebody who has to put the water should be here, and Gavin, you better guide what is to be read and what is to be done.

Now come along, both of you come. One of you should drop the - yes, you put the water, come along, she can do it, come that side. Now you, be careful, that’s all fallen off. Yes. Why don’t you put the light at the back there, somebody can gradually - with care, somebody with great care has to do it, there’s oil in it, it’s very heavy, it’s very heavy!

Now, come along. Yes. Would be better if you put it there and then light it. Put it right first of all. I think Marcus knows how to do it, Marcus? Come along. Yes. You come along, you also. What about your watch, is it all right? Good. Wipe - now rub it, rub hard, rub hard, rub it hard.

Where is the matchbox? With sahaja yogis you won’t find matchboxes! [Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs]. Rub it hard. Yes. They have offered it now. No need of...

Yogi: Say all Mother’s mantras.

[Sahaja yogis recite Three Great Mantras]:

Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, Trigunatmika, Kundalini Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Kalki Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: [Aside to a person come to wash Her Feet] See now.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Kalki Sakshat, Shri Sahasrara Swamini Moksha Pradayini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: [Aside to the person] May God bless you. Now let them come here. Rub it hard. Here. Void.

[A yogi reads out the Gospel of Matthew: 6,1-6.16-18]

Then Christ said unto his disciples: 2Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 3But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth 4that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father which sees thee in secret, himself shall reward thee openly. 5And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which sees thee in secret shall reward thee openly.

7But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 8Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him. 9After this manner pray therefore: [Yogis join in] Our Father who are in heavens, Hallowed be thy name. 10Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 11Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; 13And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

Shri Mataji [aside to the people washing their Feet:] Good. Water... you take out in... this water.

Yogi: [From the Gospel of Saint John. (13.1) – King James Bible]From the Gospel of Saint John.

1Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 2And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him; 3Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 4He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 5After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 6Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 7Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 8Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 9Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 10Jesus saith unto him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 11For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.

12So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 13Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 14If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet. 15For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. 16Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.

17If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

Other yogi [continues]: 18I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. 19Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. 20Verily, verily, I say unto you...

Shri Mataji: Loudly.

Yogi: He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

21When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 22Then the disciples looked upon one another, doubting of whom he spake. 23Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 24Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 25He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 26Jesus answered, He it is, to whom...

Shri Mataji: Now somebody else should read, because he has to wash...

Yogi: I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

Shri Mataji: Simon, you come. You come, both of you, then David will do it also. He has to wash. Who else is there? David and who else? Let Pat come to join David. Pat is there? Come along. Yes. You wash my feet. Rub it hard.

Other yogi: 27And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 28Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 29For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 30He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. 31Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 32And if God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

33Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 34A new commandment I give unto you, That ye shall love one another; as I have loved you, that ye shall also love one another. 35By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. 36Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, [Whither] I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. 37Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. 38Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.

Shri Mataji (aside to the person washing Her Feet:) It’s all right. Put it a little bit...

Other yogi: 1Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. 4And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

5Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 6Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 7If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

Shri Mataji: “Have seen Him”: see, this point they miss!

Yogi: 8Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 9Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Show us the Father? 10Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 11Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake. 12Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he also do; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 13And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

Shri Mataji: Good, beautiful. [Aside to the people washing Her feet] Come. Good, now: you can take this water in something else this side. Take it. Take the other one now, better... Good.

Yogi: 15If ye love me, keep my commandments.

Shri Mataji: Loudly.

Yogi: 15If ye love me, keep my commandments. 16And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 17Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. 18I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 19Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. 20At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 21He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him ...

Shri Mataji: See now: First Commandment he said, that you love each other.

The disciples must love each other, he didn’t say any Dick, Tom and Harry. First love the disciples, all of you should love each other, that’s the main thing is. First thing is that. Second is, “My father”.

See the relationship.

Yogi: ... and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 22Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 23Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 24He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is (not) mine, but the Father’s which sent me.

25These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. 26But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 27Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 28Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

Shri Mataji: Good. Start it with the high tones, will keep it up, you see. The thing is people must hear you. [To a person washing Her feet] Good. Now just see the hands - vibrations.

Gavin: And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. 30Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 31But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.

Shri Mataji: Hm!

Yogi: Arise, let us go hence.

1I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 2Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it...

Shri Mataji: See!

Gavin: ... that it may bring forth more fruit.

3Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 4Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 5I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. 6If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. 7If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

8Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

9As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. 10If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now come along, now come. John and Don. Yes. Just take it in the bowl.

Gavin: 11These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. 12This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. 13Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 14Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. 15Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

Shri Mataji: Rub it hard. Hard. Hm. Very hard.

Yogi: 16Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go forth and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. 17These things I command you, that ye love one another. 18If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.

Shri Mataji: Throughout one Commandment. Just see. Because He knew that if you don’t love each other, nobody is going to believe you.

Yogi: 19If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 20Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.

If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;

[Shri Mataji nods Her head affirmatively]

Yogi: ... if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. 21But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me. 22If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin...

Shri Mataji: They had...?

Yogi [repeats]: They had not had sin. [Shri Mataji nods affirmatively]. But now they have no cloak for their sin. [Shri Mataji smiles] 23He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

24If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

Shri Mataji: See. Very true.

Yogi: 26But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:

Shri Mataji: Spirit of Truth is the point. You see, you get the Spirit of Truth and then testify, you can testify.

Yogi: 27And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.

Shri Mataji: From the very beginning. Though in Hebrew it may not be he or she, I think so. Not sure, but you see, must be some sort of a gender person.

[To the person washing Her feet] Now stop your movement, just stop it. Just keep it steady. Absolutely. Steady it. You still you are moving.

Other yogi: 1These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. 2They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

[Shri Mataji: “Better. Put your hands towards me”] 3And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 4But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. [Shri Mataji to the person washing Her feet: “All right?”.]

And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. 5But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 6But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 7Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. 8And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness and of judgment. 9Of sin, because they believe not on me; 10Of righteousness...

Shri Mataji: I think you stand up, and say, you see, because people can’t hear you. See now how clearly, again, just read it. How clear it is. What a nice chapter today.

Yogi [repeats]: 7Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Her [laughter, Shri Mataji smiles]unto you.

8And when She is come, She will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness and of judgment: 9Of sin, because they believe not on me; 10Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; 11Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. 12I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot hear (bear) them now.

Howbeit when She, the Spirit of truth, is come, She will guide you into all truth: for She shall not speak (of) himself; but whatsoever She shall hear, that shall She speak: and She will shew you things to come.

Shri Mataji: Whatsoever She saw.

Yogi (repeats): ... and SHE will shew you things to come.

Shri Mataji: No, before this sentence, what is it?

Yogi (repeats): 13Howbeit when Her, the Spirit of truth, is come, She will guide you into all truth: for She shall not speak of Herself; but whatsoever She shall hear, that shall She speak: and She will shew you things to come. 14She shall glorify me: for She shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. 15All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that She shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. 16A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

Shri Mataji [to somebody washing Her feet]: Now better? Yes, better. Better now?

Just see on his head. Are you alright?

He is alright. Alright. Now. May God bless you [Shri Mataji makes bandhans around the person].

Other yogi: 17Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto thee - What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: (and), Because I go unto the Father? 18They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? He cannot tell what he saith. 19Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? 20Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. 21A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born unto the world. 22And ye now therefore - and ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. 23And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.

Shri Mataji: In that day, you see? You shall ask me nothing. [Shri Mataji smiles, laughter]

Yogi: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he shall give it you. 24Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. 25These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs [Shri Mataji laughs] but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. 26At that time of day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: 27For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Now what more you want? Said everything! Read the Resurrection part, somewhere. [To the person washing Her feet] All right. First here make... this side. Did you tell? Good. Here. Now put your hands towards me. All right? Good. Now.

Can we – I was thinking – all right, for Mandy and Magda, you can come and wash my hands. Ken, one of the things. If you can bring a bucket or something you can put on that...

Yogi: [John, 19.41] 41Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 42There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

1The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. [Shri Mataji: “Get a bucket or something”.] Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we do not know where they have laid him. [Shri Mataji: “Some bucket”.] 3Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 4So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 5And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 6Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 7And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 8Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. 9For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 10Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 11But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 12And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 13And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 14And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 15Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, take (tell) me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 16Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

Shri Mataji [to one of the yoginis]: Left is catching. Just rub this left foot. Rub it. Just rub the left. All right. See, these two, two fingers up here, see, Vishuddhi and Agnya. Rub it hard.

Other yogi: 18Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. 19Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 20And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. 21Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. 22And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 23Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

24But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 25The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. 26And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 27Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

28And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 29Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. 30And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: 31But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

Shri Mataji: He tried to awaken their Kundalini. It’s not written in this book; I wish they had written. Many Christians would have been saved [Shri Mataji smiles].

All right. So better? Wash my hands. Yes, two for one hand. Wash it. Hard Hold the another one.

Yogini [reads further]: After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea ...

Shri Mataji: Stand up and read loudly, I can’t hear you.

Yogini: 1After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 2There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. 3Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.

4But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 5Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 6And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 7Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 8And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.

9As soon then as they were come to the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 10Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 11Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty-three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.

12Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 13Jesus then cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 14This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

15So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas... Simon, son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;...

Shri Mataji [to the person washing Her hands]: See the vibrations, are better now.

Yogini: ...thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. [Shri Mataji aside: “We’ll give something else”...]

16He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 17He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all these things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 18Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not go.

19This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. 20Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

21Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 22Jesus saith unto him, If I will [Shri Mataji (aside): “Honey”...] that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?

Shri Mataji (aside): Honey, honey... honey.

Yogini: Follow thou me. 23Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? 24This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. 25And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that shall (should) be written.

Shri Mataji: Ah, you see, He said that, “Thou shalt not die.” What does that mean? Nobody dies, isn’t it? And that you’ll be revived, you’ll have an Eternal Life!

[To the people offering the elements]

Good. Now ... that should do. Just pour it. Yes. Is it over? You didn’t show - read the Resurrection itself.

[To the people offering the elements] ... you should pour some honey also, pour something. Better. Honey is there. Pour all that.

It’s good. That will do. Now. More milk.

More milk. Gavin? [Gavin: “Yes, Mother”] More milk. Good.

Gavin: [John 20: 19-23] 36And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 37But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 38And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 39Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

Shri Mataji: That’s it!

Gavin: 40And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. 41And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 42And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 43And he took it, and did eat before them. 44And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. 45Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 46And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48And ye are witnesses of these things. 49And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you...

Shri Mataji: Behold?

Gavin (repeats): ... I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

Shri Mataji: Just read this one: “I’ll tarry you...”. [To the person] I’ll have some more water.

Gavin: I’ll tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

Shri Mataji: Again, please. I didn’t follow every word. “I will tarry you...”.

[To the person pouring water in Her hands into the amrut] Yes.

Gavin [repeats loudly:] Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

Shri Mataji: See? [Shri Mataji smiles]

Gavin: And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 51And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. 52And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 53And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.

Shri Mataji: It’s promised! I’ve said it many-a-times, you are promised!

[Aside] Very good. How I think should we do - we’ll have food and then have havan? What is it? Is food ready or... We can have havan and then have the food, whichever way you see. I’m free tonight, for the whole night [laughter]. Whatever you say. Why this?

Gavin: Mother, for this puja we don’tgive You a sari. [A box is offered to Her]

Shri Mataji: Oh, good.

Gavin: We give You something more symbolic.

Shri Mataji: That’s good. May God bless you. Beautiful. Can I open? Beautiful.

[Shri Mataji has difficulties opening the gift. Somebody: “Can you help?” A yogini is trying to help: “Comes off, Mother...”].

Gavin: What a granthi! [Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Really beautiful, Gavin. Really beautiful. What’s in there? Gavin?

That’s not good, that’s too much. I don’t know how you could think of all these things, this is too much.

Yogini: Mother? Mother? It’s a real egg.

Shri Mataji: It’s a real egg.

Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: I know, I could feel the - could feel it. Must be duck’s egg. Or something. It’s very big, eh?

Some yogis: Goose.

Yogini: It’s a goose egg.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogini: Goose egg.

Shri Mataji: Goose egg. Very well done. Good. All right. And this one is? [A ring]

It’s too much, Gavin, it’s too much. Very beautiful. Thank you.

Gavin and yogis: Jai Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much, thank you. It’s so beautiful, you can’t imagine. Very beautiful. It has that pradakshina round the Spirit [Shri Mataji shows the ring around Her finger. She probably refers to the fact that the ring has a ruby in the middle – the stone representing the heart - with a gold round frame around the ruby].

See? It’s beautiful. What a choice, it’s a beauty.

We shouldn’t spend money on gold.

It’s beautiful. It’s too much, you shouldn’t give so expensive things to me. Where did you get this egg? Real beauty I think [laughter]. It’s quite an antique. Could you do it carefully, again, tie it up.

What an idea. I wish the egg that walks becomes like this, all adorned, with all the beauty. All the precious things.

[Some children bring some gift to Shri Mataji]

Yes? You brought this for me? Hello, what’s that? This is what? This is what you’ve got? Eh? What’s this for? Now what is there?

[Shri Mataji kisses the child] This. Hm?

It’s flower? This is - flower? [Shri Mataji takes the little girl on Her lap]. What happened? You’ve been crying! Don’t cry.

[She plays with a toy with the child]

Did you see this one is? What’s that? She is becoming a farmer or what? [Laughter] See this flower. Good? Nice. (Laughter)

[Shri Mataji goes on playing tenderly with the little girl on Her lap] So what about chana? [Shri Mataji feeds chana to the child and laughs] Now what’s that? She is getting taller!

So now, what is the programme, next? Is - what about dinner? Or should we have the puja first? Who is the in-charge?

I was saying that Nick should be in charge of this place and Norman should assist him, and they should form all the rules and regulations of this place.

And when Harry comes, his wife will look after the cooking side of it, and the cleanliness of the place, because she’ll stay at home, and Harry will look after the Puja part.

I think to the other ashram also, whatever is needed you must do the needful, make it a comfortable place. And, any other problems with this place? You have got sufficient rugs and carpets to spread here? Nick?

Nick: We have about fourteen, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Nick: We have about fourteen carpets...

Shri Mataji: Forty carpets.

Nick: Fourteen, that You bought for us.

Yogini: Fourteen.

Shri Mataji: Forty.

Yogini: Fourteen.

Shri Mataji: Fourteen.

Yogini: Yes.

Yogi: It’s all the carpets You bought for us... (inaudible), Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s true, but what about for people in the bedrooms, are they all right for them or they need something more?

Yogi: I think there are a few, Mother, that still need some flooring.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogi: There are some rooms that still need carpets, Mother.

Shri Mataji: They have parquet. But maybe you might need some - these carpets you brought, the other ones, door-to-door ones, have you spread them somewhere?

Yogi: Some of them, Mother. Most of them come in this area, here.

Shri Mataji: Area, hm. Yes. Do you know, these are little small for the bedrooms, I think. If there’s any need of anything you should let us know, but you must keep some rooms vacant for the guests who are coming here. All right?

Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Some rooms must be kept. Norman, you would just go and see what you would like to keep some of them, comfortable ones, for the guests who come from anywhere else? And what about the food arrangements, are all right?

Yogi: No, I think this is being sorted out now, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogi: We are sorting this out now, Mother...

Shri Mataji: What about the gas, gas connection?

Yogi: Gas is on, Mother.

Other yogi: It’s on, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It’s on. I mean, if you need, let me know. I don’t know what are your needs, it’s such a huge thing [Shri Mataji laughs] that I can’t make out what you need and what you want. Is done very well, I should say. Agnya is done very well [Shri Mataji is looking at some decorations on the wall] and all these things.

Now what’s that? It’s a cake! [Shri Mataji laughs] All right. So, can you hold it for me? [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]. Now, should I cut the cake first, and then take the flowers, all right?

Thank you. So this is to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. And resurrection of all the sahaja yogis. May God bless you all.

[Shri Mataji receives flowers] Thank you. Just beautiful. May God bless you. Hm. Good. Thank you. Hm. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Very good vibrations. Put your hands under my feet, let’s see, under, like that. Now put your head down there, let’s see. Beautiful, good, great. Now let’s see her. Let her come alright. Come along, put your foot, hands too. So, you have to tell me your names again. What’s your name?

Girl: Lisa.

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Girl: Lisa.

Shri Mataji: Lisa. I know.

Do you like this kind of dress, Lisa? Next time for you also.

New one for Bumble – good, she is all right, I think she is all right– - one for Athena, one for Olympia. They’ll wear this kind of a dress. Eh? How will they look, very sweet. Let them wear saris, I think, next time - that would be the best [Shri Mataji laughs]. Imagine, Athena and Olympia wearing that [laughter]. Now, it’s better. [Flowers] Thank you very much. May God bless you.

What is it now, Gavin?

Gavin: Mother, with Your permission, Arneau has written a dedication.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Gavin: Arneau sent it.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

Gavin: And then we’d like to sing Your aarti, and then You could have Your supper.

Shri Mataji: All right. What is?

Gavin: After this we’ll sing Your aarti, and then You may have Your supper.

Shri Mataji: All right. Please. [Shri Mataji laughs] All right, come along.

Gavin (reads): “Mother, for Your birthday, we have made a pledge: we should dedicate our life to Sahaja Yoga. What is this pledge, and to what extent can we follow this pledge?

We have to be collectively surrended to our Beloved Mother.

We are collective the moment our Spirit rejoins Your Heart, Mother.

We are collective the moment Your Smile irradiates our beings.

We are collective the moment Your eyes of love and compassion pour into our heart their Divine flow of unequalled beauty.

We are collective the moment Your heart touches with softness and peace the inner part of our Selves; collective means one heart, in the Heart of the Divine. One smile, in the Smile of God Almighty; one joy melted in the Divine Joy of Your Glory, You, our Beloved Mother.

One sound, expressed through the extremely beautiful melody of Your Voice; then, we surrender to You. Surrender is a happening; it is the exchange of love between the Mother and the child.

Let us melt Your Heart, let us dissolve ourselves in the inner part of Your Heart; so that we can see and feel the glory of Your Becoming; the tenderness of Your Face and the grace of Your Hands.

But surrender is more: surrender is action magnified through collectivity. How can we love You, Mother, if we do not act? [Shri Mataji seems to say in a low voice: “Wah”]

How can we follow You if we don’t find?

How can we be the Golden Builders, if we do not build Your love and compassion in our hearts?

Let us pray to You, Mother, to be Your soldiers, the soldiers of truth and of righteousness. Please, take out our passivity.

Kill our inaction. Destroy our apathy.

Brothers and sisters, let us wake up to gain the battlefield: are we sahaja yogis or are we cowards? Do we realise that we are the children of Adi Shakti? Do we see, every second of our life, that She is Almighty, that everything which lives and pulsates comes from Her, and goes to Her? That the whole universe is in Her command, and bows at Her Lotus Feet? That all the angels are protecting us, to win the war?

We are not allowed to sit down, we have to stand up, to take the sword, to hold it firm in our hands: what is more glorious and beautiful than to fight alongside our Beloved Mother?

When in the middle of the battlefield we feel all is against us, let us just pronounce Her Name in our heart: Your Name, Mother, like a pure river, cleans and eliminates our fears and doubts, fills us with confidence and joy, courage and faith, because Your Name is the Name of God Almighty; let us collectively surrender to You, extreme beauty, extraordinary glory, eternal purity, cosmic power, greatest love, unsurpassed splendour shining all over the universe - Mother, Mother of all the Mothers, Mother of Your devoted children, this is our pledge; and with Your grace and blessings, therefore reside in our heart forever”.

Shri Mataji: What beauty. Beautiful. [Shri Mataji laughs] More than any aarti. He realises, he realises the dimensions, all the dimensions of this great time he realises, you see; you can see it very clearly. It will work out; as I told you the other day, infrastructure, you see, has to work out, first of all, and the Kundalini will work out, and then it will spark. Nothing to be disappointed, it will work out. Kundalini will work out, but you have to be very strong about certain things, of loving others. Strong to love, is the point; of giving, of sacrificing, forbearing, enjoying it. Mildness, sweetness, gentleness, graciousness towards others; and towards yourself you have to be firm.

May God bless you all. May God bless you. May God bless you all.

Whatever is said in this prayer, be your own; may it happen to you; may it give you the manifestation of what is desired.

May God bless you.

I was thinking, David, you can along with Don and Gavin and all such people, you see, those who can talk to Mr. Bishop [of] Canterbury fellow, could go and see him, some of you, could go and see him, and tell him that this is the what it is, just for yourself; if She is the Comforter, if She is the One who has come, will it not be amiss for you, why not you first see Her and judge Her?

Yogi: Mother, Mother, the man on the radio said that if lots of people write to him, then it could be a hour-long programme. Would be good.

Shri Mataji: Better all of you write.
