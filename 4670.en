b'Easter Puja, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Creation of Lord Jesus\xe2\x80\x9d. Nightingale Lane Ashram, London (UK), 11 April 1982.\n\nToday we are celebrating the day which is a very, very important issue: absolutely the most important, we can say, day, when such a great happening took place. And it had to take place that way because all, in a way, was that strict.\n\nIn my last lectures, I have told you how Christ was created first in the heavens. In the Devi Bhagvat, if you read that, [it describes how] He was created as Mahavishnu and it is mentioned very clearly that first He was created as an egg. It is written in this book, which perhaps was written 14,000 years back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a book that predicts about Christ and that is why people, in the West, at Easter especially, offer an egg to each other as a friend. So, first the existence came on this Earth as an egg that was Christ and part of it was kept in that state and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost, by Mahalakshmi, to create Christ out of it. In that ancient book He was called as Mahavishnu, means the greater form of Vishnu. But actually Vishnu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.\n\nAfter my lecture, I would like, if you have the book, to read it out to them \xe2\x80\x93 the whole text of how Christ was created and when He was created.\n\nHe cried for His father and He cried also on the cross once, and He cried for years and then Christ, in Mahavishnu state, was blessed by His father who said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour position will be placed higher than mine and you will be the adhara,\xe2\x80\x9d means the support of the universe. See how from Mooladhara He becomes the adhara. This was all done at the heavenly stage Vaikuntha stage.\n\nYou can say then, He was given birth by the Holy Ghost who was the Mother of Christ on this Earth, who was nobody else but was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi, means She was Radha: Ra-dha; Ra means energy, dha is the one who sustains energy.\n\nThere are many aspects of Easter, one has to understand, but the most of all is: why did He have to die and why was He resurrected? This point I have not yet touched perhaps so clearly. That\xe2\x80\x99s the point I want to teIl you today. It\xe2\x80\x99s only you people can understand the importance of the life of Christ. And when it is said that you have to get your Realisation through Christ, it means that He had to pierce through the Agnya chakra. He had to be there. If He had not created this gap in the gate, we could never have got Realisation. That is why it is said you are to pass through the gates of heaven only with the grace of Christ. Of course, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean churches, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean at all churches. You have to understand as a Sahaj Yogi that you have to pass through the Agnya chakra. Ultimately that\xe2\x80\x99s the most difficult point where human beings had to pass, because, at the Agnya Chakra, your ego and superego are fully grown. At the human stage only, this ego is developed.\n\nNow, how to overcome the ego was a point, and to overcome the ego Christ had to do this.\n\nHe was created in the beginning, as Shri Ganesha. You know the story how He was created: that the mala from the body of Parvati was taken out, because before Her marriage She had to cover Herself for Her bath with many scented things, and it was taken out \xe2\x80\x93 all these things \xe2\x80\x93 and Her vibrations came out. And She created this Child just to protect Her chastity. Outside Her bathroom She put Him and you know the whole story about it.\n\nNow, there was a part of the element of the earth in that child, prithvi tattwa was there. All other centres, have got some elements in them, some elements, like prithvi tattwa is there: earth element. Then you have got water element, then you have got air element, and when you come to this (Agnya), it is the light element, it\xe2\x80\x99s the light. And, at this point, at Agnya chakra, He had to cross the last element; that was the light element.\n\nThat means He had to come out into the true form of only the Divine Power, the Omkara, the vibrations, you can call it, or the Absolute. You call it the Logos or something like that: the first sound, Brahma.\n\nSo He had to become the Principle of Brahma. To become the Principle of Brahma, He had to get rid of all other elements in Him. So, the last was also the light element, which He also had to cross through. So he had earth element in Him, as He was of the mala, and all other elements within Him. But, when it comes to the Agnya, He had to give up all the elements, He had to die the death of all these elements that were within Him to become complete, absolute; pure Spirit.\n\nWhat He did in subtle form works out in the gross form, and to do that He had to die, and whatever died in Him was that little earth element and other elements. And what came out of Him was pure Spirit, was pure Spirit. That was resurrected, the pure Spirit, the pure Brahma Tattwa which had formed the body of Christ which was the body of Christ. And this happening came.\n\nChrist has done what was predicted about Him: that He\xe2\x80\x99s a Saviour because He passed through that gate to take people from this bodily existence \xe2\x80\x93 means the one that depends on the elements \xe2\x80\x93 to that existence which is Spirit.\n\nSo the Resurrection is where you become. From your attention you jump into the attention of the Spirit: when you feel your attention, when you become the Spirit. That is the happening which has happened to you also. But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma Tattwa, when He was resurrected.\n\nAnd the Resurrection is a happening of the Divine Power which came from Mooladhara Chakra as just earth element [and] started growing. It took its birth from there, came up to Agnya chakra. There Christ was created to pass through all the elements, ultimately to enter the Sahastrara to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.\n\nAnd this was a very difficult thing, was very experimental. And the experiment was a quite dangerous one. It could have failed, because He had in Him that human element, the body element, which suffers. And He suffered, because this body element suffers \xe2\x80\x93 not the Spirit, the Spirit does not suffer, the body suffers. So, He had to suffer that body element and to get over it, to get out of it. And to get out of it, He had to have a tremendous courage. It was such a difficult operation. Without Him nobody could have achieved it.\n\nHe knew it was predestined, but it was one of the most difficult things to happen. I wonder how many Christians know the significance of an egg. Now, egg signifies a stage where you are, before Realisation, when you are in your egg shell: that you are Mr X, you are Mrs Y. But, when you mature fully inside, the bird is ready and that is the time you are hatched. This is the time you get twice-born. So, the Resurrection of Christ signifies that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we give that egg to people, saying you are that, an egg, a reminder of that; and this egg can become a Spirit.\n\nAnd also it is written that it was an egg when He came first, He was created as an egg: half of it remained as Shri Ganesha, and half of it became Mahavishnu.\n\nThen He came on this Earth and He departed with all His elements and the pure vibrations formed His body. He remained there, within all of you, to be awakened. And when the Kundalini takes your attention through that point there, you also become the Spirit. That\xe2\x80\x99s why He said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the gate, I\xe2\x80\x99m the door.\xe2\x80\x9d Because you cannot become Christ. That\xe2\x80\x99s why He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the destination,\xe2\x80\x9d that you have to achieve Him. But, He has created this space for you. You can become spiritually awakened. You can become your Spirit.\n\nBut, Christ is an incarnation. He was the Son of God, and so He\xe2\x80\x99s an incarnation. And that incarnation came on this Earth just to pull you out of your elements to make you become the Spirit.\n\nNow, how it is that it was the most difficult thing? Because human beings have created in their heads all kinds of artificial barriers: whatever we think and whatever we do with our mind is all dead, manmade, is artificial, because reality is beyond your mind, it is not in your mind, you cannot conceive it, you cannot hold it.\n\nWhatever is in your mind is not the reality. It is beyond. So, for a human being to accept something that is beyond the mind had become so difficult, at the time of Christ because of Romans and all these people coming up. We are repeating the history again. They were so ego-oriented, they were so full of ego that to destroy their ego somebody had to do this, to create a passage.\n\nBy His death so many things are proved: that all those who crucified Him were stupid people, they were ego-oriented, they were blind, they could not see what He saw. They could not see what a genuine personality He was. They crucified Him. I mean, this is the greatest stupidity, and they crucified Him. It was all known because these people were so stupid they would have only crucified Him. What else could they do? Because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear with their little egos somebody who is so simple, who is so genuine, who is so true, so they crucified Him, and that Crucifixion came as a breakthrough for us.\n\nBut the message for us is the Resurrection part. The message for us is the Resurrection and not Crucifixion. Crucifixion is not the message because He has done it for us. This is the point where the Jews must understand. The other day I was reading, today only, some discussion with the Archbishop of Canterbury took place, and the fellow was asking him questions as if he was asking questions to God. And, in a way, he said also that, \xe2\x80\x9cI would ask this question to God, that: why is it so many Jews were killed?\xe2\x80\x9d They asked for it! They wanted that they must suffer because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give the credit of suffering to Christ. They thought we all had to suffer. Ego. It\xe2\x80\x99s ego. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did anybody suffer for us, we must suffer separately!\xe2\x80\x9d They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give that credit to Christ. And all the later thinking was that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must suffer!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, whatever you think comes into action on this gross level. So Mr. Hitler was born and he made them suffer; and the stupidity of human beings is responsible for all the problems that are created on this Earth. The other question was: \xe2\x80\x9cHow the children get leukaemia?\xe2\x80\x9d [That] he would ask God: \xe2\x80\x9cHow children get leukaemia?\xe2\x80\x9d If the parents are so frantic and speedy, children have to get it. If you are not relaxed person when you are married, when you are going to have a baby, you are thinking of divorces and all sorts of nonsense, that franticness will work on the child. Psychologically it is a left-side problem, and the child has to be a patient of leukaemia as soon as he\xe2\x80\x99s born. That is what it is!\n\nSo, the problems are created by human beings because of their stupidity. There is no problem that God has created for you. He has solved all your problems. All our problems He solves. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Sahaj Yoga how He solves your little, little problems even. But, we create problems for ourselves: by our stupidity, by our addiction to elements, to material things, to material habits. Matter sits on our head: that is, we can say on the level of the earth element.\n\nThen, we have other problems, like emotional attachments: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my child,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so attached to my child,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your country.\xe2\x80\x9d We create problems. This Falkland thing, what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get out of this territory? This Falkland this thing is an artificial problem, you can see that. I mean, when these people went there, these Spaniards, they all should been given back to Spain! And all from Brazil should be given back to Portugal! What are they doing there, if this is the situation? But they are all human beings. What is this territory business? So let the human beings live happily wherever they are. What are they going to get out of this territory?\n\nGod never created Argentina, Chile, England and all that. She created one homogeneous structure and it is to look after each other: like a heart is created, a liver is created, a brain is created, a nose is created. If they start fighting\xe2\x80\xa6say this eye starts fighting this eye\xe2\x80\xa6(laughter). We laugh, but we human beings do the same thing! We are all the time doing it. This is the stupidity of human beings, which is creating problems. And when you become very stupid, somebody horrible takes advantage of that and comes on this Earth, just like Hitler, and he tries to put you right. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need all that, you need only wisdom and your Realisation. And that is what is done today, that you have got Realisation.\n\nSo Easter for Sahaj Yogis all over the world is the most important happening because if it had not happened it would not have been possible to give Realisation to people.\n\nI think Gavin will read it out to you later on about what is written about Christ in Devi Bhagwatam. This book was written about 14,000 years back by Markandaya. So, imagine! 14,000 years back! He knew, being a seer, just like Blake, what was going to happen when Christ was to come. But He was called as Mahavishnu. He was not Vishnu. He was the Son of Vishnu, and how many Christians understand this about Easter? They don\xe2\x80\x99t. Christianity today is nothing but a mental activity which is dead, just nonsense, just like any other nonsensical religion. It has become just another foolish, stupid religion, which has no meaning.\n\nUnless and until you get your Realisation, unless and until you feel the vibrations, unless and until you feel this Divine surrounding power, how will you understand? Because that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that is truth, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s reality. And unless and until you achieve it how will you know about Christ? And fighting about Him! How can you fight? I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. To me it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid. Gone to another extreme! By this thing what you do actually, is to use all these incarnations to kill each other. Can you imagine? The things that came to elevate you, to make you into higher living are now used, the same things, the names are used, to kill, to kill each other, to bring down each other.\n\nAt the most, if you reach a point where you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, then they start saying \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d What is the mystery? In Sahaj Yoga there\xe2\x80\x99s no mystery. It\xe2\x80\x99s all just there. To me human beings are a mystery. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand them, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\n\nThe Resurrection of Christ has to now be collective resurrection, this is what is Maha Yoga. It has to be the collective resurrection. And for this collective resurrection first of all, Sahaj Yogis must decide to be collective. Because through Kundalini awakening you cross, no doubt, you cross through. But you enter an area of collectivity and if you do not allow that collectivity to permeate into you, then you come down.\n\nSupposing you become a state beyond the elements, the state where you are a collective being. You\xe2\x80\x99re aware that you\xe2\x80\x99re a part and parcel of the Whole. You\xe2\x80\x99re aware that you have to help your nose and your eyes because you\xe2\x80\x99re a part and parcel of the Whole. You reach that stage where you understand, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as important as other cells are and other cells are helped by me and they have to sustain me.\xe2\x80\x9d We are one. There should be complete concord.\n\nThis awareness comes after Realisation and if you do not understand that this awareness, that this collective awareness, is the only way you can stay in that area, otherwise you get out. You start having your smaller wells and you just go down into them - the more you start to expand yourself, you rise higher - and then you are again with your baddhas (\xe0\xa4\xac\xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xa7) and whatever it is.\n\nBut, if you think that, \xe2\x80\x9cI have to live for the whole. I\xe2\x80\x99m responsible for the whole. I\xe2\x80\x99m responsible for creating a nucleus of a cell which is going to look after the whole, and if I fall down the rest also suffers. I have no business to fall down because I have been resurrected to this point. I\xe2\x80\x99ve entered into the state of collectivity where my being, which is the Spirit, is the collective being and I have to stay there, I have to be there. I cannot fall, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way I can live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut, I have seen, after Realisation also, people cannot get out of their shells. They still remain in the shell. They cannot spread their wings and sing and get out of their shell and just fly. They cannot do it. They still stick on to their small ways of life in a smaller way, in every way. On a holiday you go, you want to have a separate holiday. Why? This is the holiday time! \xe2\x80\x98Holy day\xe2\x80\x99, as they say - holy day. This the holy day. When you are with other Sahaj Yogis you are really enjoying a holiday. When do you enjoy a holiday otherwise? Which is the other way? To be with them is the real holiday. That is why one should understand that you should expand your collectivity.\n\nIf you do not expand your collectivity you are just a waste. You are a wasteful creation of Sahaj Yogis, which, I am sorry to say, will go down.\n\nSuch people show also, in the beginning: gradually they start getting better and better and once you are in full state you start enjoying each other\xe2\x80\x99s company without any fears about them, without having any possessiveness about them without having any kind of expectations, but just enjoying it. That has to happen. All our cells in our body are like that. If they can do it why not we? Because we have so much of sense, at least we think we have more sense than the cells have. At least it is expected because we have evolved so much from [a] unicell to this state. And then you are the epitome of God\xe2\x80\x99s creation! You are the topmost people. Then why not?\n\nWhen you are resurrected the first thing that should happen to you is to understand you are no more an individual, but you are a collective being. You are no more an individual. All things which make you circumcise your individuality \xe2\x80\x93 throw that away!\n\nYou are no more an individual. All problems which come to you as individual problems are absolutely useless, false, wasteful. Think of the collective problems. I enjoy such people. Like the other day Fergy (Derek Ferguson) was anxious to know for Bristol which points are there which are giving vibrations from the Mother Earth. He\xe2\x80\x99s worried about the whole of Bristol, all the Jamaicans, then about the British people, and then of the whole world. You should be. One should not think, \xe2\x80\x9cHow will my daughter get married?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I get a ticket to go there?\xe2\x80\x9d All these nonsensical ideas should be given up! Because you are now entered into the Kingdom of God and He\xe2\x80\x99s going to look after you. Because that state you establish within yourself, that you are a collective being.\n\nAll other things will drop out. Gradually everybody will be remoulded. Even the most difficult type, I have seen, have improved.\n\nBut what about you, the one who is improving everybody else? What about you? How far are you there? How far in your faith that you know that, \xe2\x80\x9cI have entered into the Kingdom of God and that action of mine is looked after and guided by His power, and I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of it\xe2\x80\x9d? \xe2\x80\x9cI am aware that I\xe2\x80\x99ve entered into the Kingdom of God, which is expressed through my collectivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo collectivity is the nature of a Sahaj Yogi and that\xe2\x80\x99s what one has to realise.\n\nMay God bless you!'
