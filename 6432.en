Public Program, "The Inner Religion". Palais des Congr√®s, Paris (France), 12 July 1994.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot transform it. We cannot compromise with it. It is what it is, it has been what it has been, and it will be what it has been. So it doesn't change. What is needed is that we have to change. So, what is the truth? Truth is that you are not this body, this mind; you are not these emotions, intellect or conditionings. Nor you are ego. So what are you? 


You are the pure Spirit. All the scriptures have said this. If you are the Spirit, that is the truth. We say, "My body, my intellect, my emotions." Who is this my? So we have to become that truth. 


The another truth is when we see these beautiful flowers, we don't even think what a miraculous thing it is to have them. So beautifully planned. When you see the nature, you are amazed how every leaf gets the sun. Who looks after nature? Who does these living works? If you ask the doctor who runs your heart, he'll tell you it's an autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto? Who does this? They cannot answer. Science cannot answer many, many questions. Specially it cannot answer: Why are we on this earth? What is the purpose of our life? 


These answers only you can get when you have the self knowledge. You need not believe Me blindly, because blind faith has been very troublesome to us so far. So if this happens to you, and that you can feel this all pervading Power of Divine love which is doing all the living work, as honest people you have to believe in it. And if you become the Spirit, and if you have the powers of the Spirit from within yourself, then you'll have to believe in it.


Now, this is the special time for us to get our self knowledge, Self Realization. I call it a blossom time. But different scriptures have described them as the last judgment, or resurrection time, or all kinds of things. You have been already told about the centers that we have within ourselves. All the global problems, most of them, come from human beings. And all human problems come from the jeopardy of these chakras, centers. Whether it is physical, mental, emotional, any kind of problem comes because these chakras or these centers are not in a healthy mood. 


But if you care for your own benevolence, and benevolence of your country, benevolence of the whole world, if you really care, then this is the only way you can achieve it. So, let us see what happens when this Kundalini rises within you. In the Bible there's a mention of God Almighty and His Son, and no Mother. Mother is the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Mother. It was avoided completely, that there is any feminine power in the primordial form. This is how lots of problems are being created for women.


Now, here you have this in the triangular bone you can see the power that connects you to the Divine Power. Just like this cord which has to be connected to the mains, otherwise it is of no use. You have no identity unless and until you are connected to this power which has created you.


This power is coiled up into three and a half times and is your individual Mother. This individual Mother knows each and everything about you. Also knows what mistakes you have committed so far, and what are your aspirations. She is your individual Mother who is anxious to give you the second birth. She rises through these six centers, and pierces through the sixth center here which we call as Brahmarandhara in Sanskrit. This is a happening. This is an actualization of your baptism. It's not just a talk or a sermon. And when it is connected to the all-pervading Power, the Spirit in your heart gets enlightened. First thing that happens to you, is that you feel a cool breeze on your fingertips. It is described in the Bible as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In all the scriptures, even in Indian scriptures is described as a cool breeze. In the Koran it is described as Ruh.


Now this all-pervading Divine Power is there, existing, we have to just get connected to it. You also start getting the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area on top of your head. Now you have to certify yourself, nobody is going to certify you. You have to certify yourself. Are you feeling this cool breeze or not? Are you getting this cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area or not?   It's a physical happening.


Then you start feeling all the centers on your fingertips. You can feel your own centers, and then you can also feel the centers of others. Then who is the other? You become one with the ocean. Then all this world you feel is your own.


There are many who do not believe in one God, who not believe in, say, God. There are many who don't believe in God. But when they believe in something, they have not seen it. How can you say there is no God? It's not scientific. You should first find out if there is God or not. By just saying that there is no God, there is one God, there are ten Gods - how do you know? So first you have to get to a point from where you can know the absolute truth. Then once you have this connection, you can ask: is there God? And the vibrations start flowing much more. Because that's the absolute truth:  there is God. Many people have become atheist, given up religion, to them it's all a myth. To them it's all nonsense. Also when they see in the name of God so many horrible things are doing, they get, ah, they get absolutely disgusted. 


So you have to first make them the instrument which can feel the truth. In Sanskrit we call it bodha. Meaning that you should feel it on your central nervous system. From where the word Buddha has come, the one who can, who is enlightened. Another word they've used is vida. Vida means to know on your central nervous system. From where the word veda has come. Now if this knowledge was so ancient, ten thousand years back people knew it in India, there are certain reasons for that. In India, the climate was such that people don't have to worry about going out or about looking after the nature. They - nature is very kind to them. You could live in the jungles, you can live wherever you wanted.  There is no restriction, because the nature is so kind. As the result of that, people become introspective. They started meditating. And they found out that there is this Kundalini Power which, if it is raised, you can get your Self Realization. 


If any knowledge is coming from the West, we accept in India, isn't it? But if any knowledge is coming from India, why should anybody avoid it?  Because it is for the benevolence of people. It has nothing to do with outside religions. It is something inner, knowledge that was there. Also we had lots of people like Lao Tse, like Zen system, we had people also in England, like William Blake. So many of them had talked about this inner knowledge. And they were all saints. I was surprised that in Colombia, they had the knowledge of Kundalini. And they used to make ornaments like Kundalini. So if you open your eyes and open your heart you will find everywhere there was this knowledge about the ascent of man. 


It was in the tradition of awakening that time that only one master will give it to one disciple. Gradually, it started appearing in poems and scriptures. But nobody really talked about it in an open way. We had also lots of Sufis all over the world who knew about it. 


Now we have to understand the time has come for thousands to get Self Realization. For example in Russia, we have in one village twenty one thousand Sahaja yogis.  Twenty one thousand! Because they are not conditioned. They are a clean slate. I don't say democracy is not desirable, very much desirable. But one must have knowledge how to use freedom. 


The second thing that happens to you, that your inner religion is enlightened, inner religion. These chakras are created by great prophets. They have talked of religion in the real sense of the word. But they do not follow religion. You may be Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything, you can commit any kind of sin. But once you become a saint, you do not. Nothing can tempt you. For that you don't have to leave your houses, families, nothing. It's inside yourself. 


We talk of peace. And we ... I have met many people who have been awarded peace awards. But they have no peace within. How can they spread peace? With these awards, can you spread peace? All the religions are the signboards to enter into the Kingdom of God. But if you are just standing at the signboard, and reading the signboard, will you enter in? You have to leave the signboard, and come up to this center where resides all peace, joy and happiness.


We find very difficult sometimes to follow any religion whatsoever. I've known people where it is prohibited to drink, they drink like fish. And all such things. The reason is they are not hypocrites, they are human beings. They are ordinary human beings. So if they are drinking, there's nothing wrong in that. Just by branding yourself as something, you don't become that. But once you become, then nobody has to tell you "don't drink," you just drop it.


I always give an example of a person carrying a snake in the hand, in the darkness. And the person is very obstinate and conditioned. And he won't accept that there is a snake in his hand.  It's darkness. He'll say, "This is a rope," till the snake bites him. So the light has to come. Once in the light, he sees the snake, he just drops - himself, nobody has to tell him. That means we all need enlightenment: one step forward from this human awareness to a higher awareness.


Once you are enlightened, you don't do wrong things. You don't take to wrong things. Then you start understanding all these prophets, all these great incarnations, you start understanding what they were. Then you understand that all these religions have come out of one Tree of Life, which is spirituality. And we have plucked these flowers and we are fighting with the dead flowers.  There's no life in it. 


How many things have been said in the scriptures, are followed by the people who are supposed to be Christian, Muslim, Hindus? By just talking to them, it is just a lip service, you cannot convince them. 


Now this actualization gives you that power, that you become a personality which is confident, because you start using these powers. By that you can cure people. You can bring peace wherever you go. You feel absolutely protected. So many miracles.  Endless. I had so many letters coming to Me of the miracles they had, how they were saved, this, that. I didn't know how to answer them. 


So I asked one gentleman, "You better compile them." 


In one  month he wrote, "I've got up to my head so high, all these things now, which one am I to compile?" He asked Me I should see those and I told him, Forget it." All the miracles that they have seen is a wee bit.  You don't know how miraculous is this God Almighty. 


Then you become extremely dynamic. You don't get tired. As you know, I am seventy-one years of age and I'm traveling every day,  practically every day. But I never think I am traveling. You become extremely compassionate. Just can't help it. You can't bear any kind of sadness or any kind of malady of another person. And you have to just attend to that person, show your attention, and that person you can help. Then you know the meaning of your life. That you are the instrument of God. And when you surrender to that Divine Power, then you are amazed, how things are done by you. Everyone will say, "You have done this, you have done that." You'll be amazed, "When did I do?" We are all going to enter into that Kingdom.


Then another thing is that once this Kundalini rises, She does something very miraculous also. For example I say, "You pay attention to yourself inside," you cannot. And we are thinking all the time about the future and the past. One thought rises, falls off, another thought rises, falls off. So we are jumping on the cusp of future and past. But in between those thoughts there's a little space that is the present. The past is finished and the future doesn't exist. So what exists really? Reality is present.


So when you stand in the present, you become thoughtlessly aware. And this state is the first state you achieve, and this is the state where you become absolutely peaceful within yourself. The peace is so great that you enjoy your peaceful existence. Not only that, but you become the source of peace. Wherever you go, you emit peace. 


We talk of peace. It is not possible without self knowledge to establish peace, I can tell you this [much]. Now as you must have heard that Sahaja Yoga is working in sicty-five nations. Of different creeds, of different nations, of different races, of different religions. But I have not seen anybody quarreling or fighting, or arguing even. They pull each others leg for fun, that's all right. Because they all know the same truth,  it's absolute. Whether you are a Mussulman or you are a Hindu, or a Christian, or anything, if you know the same truth within yourself, then what is the fight? 

When you see the greatness of Jesus, greatness of Hazrat Mohammed, you see the greatness of Shri Rama, you understand that They are all together, we are different. Christ has said clearly, "Those who are not against us are with us." So who are those who are with us? So in the realm of the Divine, you will find out that all these great incarnations, prophets came on this earth to establish human beings on the right path. So that they can enter into the Kingdom of God. 


This Sahaja Yoga that we are talking about is the last breakthrough of our evolution. Firstly you know the absolute truth - you know. All of you know the same truth. Not mentally, but in the heart. It is beyond mental. And that is what ... as you know I'm sitting here, is a fact. In the same way, you know the absolute truth. 


So what is it after all, all these United Nations, this, that you have, I know all of them very well. There is no truth about it. It's all a sort of a job seeking place, I think. What you have to do is to get people who have the absolute truth at the helm of affairs. I haven't seen anyone in Sahaja Yoga who cheats, who is dishonest, who tells lies. I don't have to tell them, "Don't do." No commandments. If you talk about commandments, half of them will leave the hall. And our sympathies without Self Realization go to wrong people. Actually we are confused. 


So the aim of our life is to get self knowledge, Self Realization. Now what happens that our attention becomes enlightened. Attention. The eyes become innocent. There is no greed, there is no lust. And these innocent eyes are very powerful. If you glance with these innocent eyes, you can do so much good, so much benevolence to other people. And sitting down here you can know about anyone you want to know. You don't have to go anywhere, telephone to anyone, just sitting down, you will know what is the situation of the chakras of this and this person. Because this Power which is all pervading, is the most efficient communication powers than anybody can think of. It is so alert, so attentive, so precise that surprisingly it works in split of a second. So many examples can be given. And then you become so confident because you are protected. You know you are protected. 


In this small lecture, I cannot tell you much more about it, but one thing I want to tell you, that above all you jump into the Ocean of Joy. Joy is singular. It is not like happiness and unhappiness. When your ego is pampered you are happy. When your ego is punctured you are unhappy. Now you become like a witness of the drama that's going on. When you are out of that drama, you know how to solve the problem. If you are watching something, a play, you sometimes get involved with it, and think that you are the one who is inside there. But when the play is over, you know you are here and the play is there. In the same way you see the whole world. 


Now the time has come. You must know one thing.: the God Almighty Who has created us is the greatest organizer. He's not going to allow us to destroy His creation. And I must tell you that this Divine power is so anxious now to give Self Realization. Like I was surprised that in Russia I have to always organize it in a big stadium, the program. They get their Self Realization, and then they settle with it. But in the West it is, they get Realization, then they feel very happy, then it goes round, they don't get to it. The conditionings are much more in the countries where there is democracy. Because somebody is following this religion, somebody is following that religion or somebody has these ideas. It's so mental, everything's so mental. 


Now, say the Ocean of Love, Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Joy is just there within you. So why should we not accept it? You have to little bit work it out; little bit you have to work it out. Sometimes the connection is loose as they say. So sometimes you have to see that the connection is permanent, of eternal nature. So first you have to be the Self, otherwise we are still half-baked.  Tonight I hope all of you will get your Self Realization. 


They told Me that in this month, all the Paris people are out of Paris. I said those who are seekers, I'll meet them definitely. It is so hot here, what is the use of going to Spain to burn your skin? There is no wisdom, but they do it, because they are so conditioned. In the West, people are very conditioned. Some fashion starts in Paris, everybody does that. I mean they are like sheep. There are piles and piles of clothes in every house. Indians are not like that. With tradition we have learned that this is the dress will suit us. Specially the ladies. We had one mini sari coming to Bombay. Came up to Bombay and disappeared in eight days. They said, "Get lost, this is not for us." Because traditionally we have understood that this kind of a dress is all right. Now why change every day, just for these manufacturers? And this free media that you have, media, has also ruined you. Because every time they are showing you something and even the children want that which is shown on the television. It is such an enslavement, I tell you, that sometimes it's shocking that in America the dogs have got birthdays. They have teddy bears which have got birthdays. This speciality expertise in marketing has really conditioned us completely. And media doesn't think they are doing anything sinful. As long as they are money-oriented, finished.  Money. If money had brought every kind of happiness, you'd have found the world very much better. 


It's only the spiritual wealth that gives you that joy, for others and for yourself. So let us now decide to have our self knowledge, because this power of Kundalini is of pure desire. All desires that you have are not pure. Today you want to buy a car.  Once you have the car, you don't enjoy it, you want to have a house. Then you want to have helicopter, then an aeroplane. If your desires were pure, you would have been satisfied, but you are never satisfied, because matter cannot give you satisfaction. 


So this is the pure desire we have within us:  the desire to be one with this Divine Power, whether you know it or not. So it's very important that all of you who are here, I hope you are all seekers of truth. If you have come here to criticize Me, nothing would work out, I must tell you. Of course it is not meant for idiots and mad people. You have to have a capacity and desire. I must tell you there are thousands and thousands these days who have that. Last of all, you cannot pay for it. It is a living process. How much did we pay to the Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers? It's invaluable. Money is the headache of human beings, not of God. 


It's your own right to have your Realization, it's your own right. So there's no obligation of any kind. Before giving you this Self Realization, I have to make a humble request. That's:  who don't want to have it,  I cannot force on you, because I respect your freedom. If you want to remain as you are, all right, I have nothing to say. But please leave the hall. Really I tell you it's not possible to give Self Realization to people who don't want to have it. 


All right. Now there are three conditions which are very simple. The first one is, you should have full confidence in yourself, that you all will get your Realization. That means, you should not feel in any way guilty. People tell you, "You are a sinner, you are doing this." I tell you, you are not a sinner, you are a seeker. And that's why you have every right to have your self knowledge. That means you should not feel guilty at all. Very important. You feel guilty and you catch on this center here. And I catch from you. There's so much here now, feeling guilty, it's a fashion, I think. Please, be pleasantly placed towards yourself. As I respect you, you must respect Me...You should respect yourself.     


The second condition is even simpler and very logical: that you must forgive everyone. Now many would say that "We cannot forgive, it's very difficult." But it's a myth whether you forgive or don't forgive. What do you do? You don't do anything. But when you don't forgive, then you are playing into wrong hands. That means you are torturing yourself, while those who have troubled you are quite happy. So this center which is in the center of optic chiasma is constricted like that (Shri Mataji shows how the center constricts with fingers). And if you don't forgive, it won't open. But if you forgive, it opens like that. You must not even think of those people, because it's a headache. In general you should say here today that "I forgive everyone." 


Then I have to tell you about this center.  That this center when you catch by feeling guilty. you get disease like angina, spondylitis and lethargic organs. And at this moment, if you don't forgive ... if you don't feel guilty, it will open out, this center and you will get your Realization. But this center (points to Agnya) is even much more constricted. And if you don't forgive now, then it will never open and you will miss the great chance of having your self knowledge. So all your life you have tortured yourself, and at this important moment you will also miss the most important moment of your life. So now, in general, forgive everyone. 


Third condition is very simple: you'll have to take out your shoes. Need not to take out socks, but shoes I think. As I don't know if he has told or not that we have two powers left and right within us which are expressing our sympathetic nervous system left and right. So the left side is the power of desire, and the right side is the power of action. 


So you put your left hand towards Me like this - on your lap, just like this - expressing your desire to have Self Realization. And also you should know that left and right side are expressed also in your feet, so keep them apart from each other. The right side we use, the right side we use for action, so we use our right hand for nourishing our centers.  


So please put your right hand on your heart. Because in the heart resides the Spirit. Now if you become the Spirit, in the light of Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen which is the center of your mastery. This center is created by great prophets and masters.


Now please take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now this is the center of pure Divine knowledge. Now please take your right hand upward in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now please put your right hand now on your heart.


Then in the corner, in the corner of your neck and shoulder. Now put your head on the right side. Now you have to take your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head. Here you have to forgive everyone. Now please take your hand on the backside of your head. Head, head. Backside of your head, not neck. This is the center - please put back your head - here you don't have to feel guilty, you are not to count your mistakes, but just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this Divine Power.


Now last center which is very important. Stretch your palm fully. Put the center of your palm on top of your head. And push back your fingers as far as possible. Push back. And now move your scalp slowly. Seven times. Clockwise. That's all we have to do.


Now, we start it now in a way that you close your eyes. You close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. You can also remove your spectacles, and ... because you don't have to open your eyes till I tell you.


Now, please put your right hand on your heart. Here now, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself. Please ask Me three times in your heart. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Ask the question: "Mother, am I the spirit?" Ask this question three times.


Now, I've told you that when you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So please, put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Press it with your fingers. Here ask another fundamental question to Me: "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question in your heart. I cannot force on you Self Realization, as well as the pure Divine knowledge.


So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say six times, because this center has got six petals: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini has started rising. So now here you have to say with self confidence, to open these chakras: "Mother, I am my own master." Ten times, because this center has got ten petals. I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, emotions, ego and conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit. 

So now raise your right hand on your heart. Here, you have to say twelve times, with full confidence: "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." This Divine Power is the Ocean of Knowledge. It is the Ocean of Compassion and Bliss. But above all, It is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you have committed in the past can be easily dissolved with the power of this compassion.

So now, forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder. And turn your head to your right. Here you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all."


I've already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. So at this moment you have to forgive everyone in general without thinking about them. Now please, put your right hand on top of your forehead across, and put down your head. Here, you have to say with full confidence, from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone." 


Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head. Here again, not how many times, but from heart, please push back your head properly. You have to say: "Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me." Say it from your heart.


Now the last center. Stretch your palm, and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel born area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now press it hard. Push back your fingers, and move your scalp slowly, seven times. Put down your head, put down your head. Now, I cannot force Self Realization on you, as I told you. So by moving your scalp seven times clockwise slowly, please say: "Mother, give me my Self Realization." Bend your head, bend your head.


Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes. Now please raise your hands like this. Please watch Me without thinking. Open your eyes and please watch Me without thinking. Put the right hand towards Me like this. And bend your head, and see for yourself, if there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now, please put left hand towards Me. Put down your head and see for yourself again with the right hand, if there's a cool or hot breeze like thing is coming. Now don't doubt it, please don't doubt it.


If you have not forgiven, it will be hot still, but please forgive. Now, with the right hand now, we have to see again, with our left hand, right hand towards Me and left hand on top of fontanel bone area, where you can see. Sometimes it comes close, or sometimes away. So move your hand and see for yourself. 


Now please put both your hands like this. Now put both the hands toward the sky like this, and push back your heads. Now ask anyone of these three questions three times, anyone. First one is: "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Or, "Is this the Ruh?" Or, "Is this the Paramchaitanya?" Ask any one of these questions three times in your heart. 


Now, take down your hands. Now put your hands towards Me like that. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips, or on their palm, or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. No you didn't feel it? (Shri Mataji says this to one individual in the audience.) You should.


My Goodness. This is Paris, I can't believe it.  May God bless you!


Now your new life has started. You have entered into the Kingdom of God. Be sure that you continue with it, and grow well. In this Paris when I came first, they told Me: "Mother, You look very happy, don't show your happiness." So I started My lecture with the Les Mis√©rables. Today I see so many of you. Really, it's so gratifying. But you must grow. It is not an individual process.  But it's a collective happening. So you have to come to the collective. As we don't take any money, nothing, so we don't have very elaborate places, very humble. So you have to come to the collective, because it definitely helps you to grow very fast. But if you are individual, then slowly, slowly, I find people go down. All those who haven't got also Realization, should come to the collective, you are all welcome. You'll get all the knowledge, all the books, whatever you need. 


But I really don't like people reading books much. Because it is not a bookish knowledge. It is the knowledge of experience. So when you are in the collective, you must know that you will suddenly widen your knowledge. Luckily we have very good Sahaja Yogis here, who know a lot about Sahaja Yoga. They are very humble and sweet and I'm sure they will help you very much. Of course you don't have to pay for anything. If you have any problems, you can write to Me. You can write to Me even in French, I don't mind. 


Thank you very much.


Now the message is: enjoy yourself.


May God bless you!
