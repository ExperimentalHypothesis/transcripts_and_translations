[MISSING FROM THE RECORDED SPEECH]
All of you have had it. When the Spirit shines in your attention, the attention becomes very powerful and we have never used the power of love, of pure love. The pure love is like a sap in the tree. And it goes to the various parts of the tree. It nourishes all the parts of the tree. But supposing it gets attached to any flower or any fruit, then the tree will die and the fruit will die.

So the pure love nourishes, enlightens and makes you absolutely pure. You enjoy your purity, you enjoy your virtues and a new race comes up which loves. There is no fight, there is no struggle, such a satisfied personality you develop. This attention is so pure that when you put your attention on to anyone with this purity, you can purify other person. You can cure that person, you can give peace to that person, because Spirit is the source of peace. It is the source of joy. It is not a duality of happiness and unhappiness, but singular joy. You become a person who witnesses the whole thing as a drama. 

When you are moving on the periphery of a wheel, then you feel the movement. And you feel all the disturbances. But if you are on the axis, then you see the movement of the wheel but you are at peace. This is what happens to you. 

As if when you are thinking, then a thought rises and falls down. Then another thought starts, rises and falls. So we are jumping on the cusp of the thought. In between these two thoughts there is a little space. We live in the past or in the future. But we cannot live in the present. But when you become the Spirit you live in the present. You don't react, you don't think, but thoughts come to you. This happening is so peaceful.

Like this carpet is beautiful. I watch this without thinking. Now ... then, now when I'm thinking, I think, "Oh, when can I have such a carpet?" or I think that "Who did this work?", something like that, you see. If it is mine, then I think, "Oh, God, it will be spoilt, it will be ruined." But if I'm not thinking, just looking, then I feel all the joy of this carpet which is creating this joy, the joy of the beauty.

So this state you have to reach and it is very easy. I hope today you all will achieve the awakening. As a result you develop a new awareness, and a new dimension of collective consciousness, so that you can feel the centers of another person on your fingertips. And you can feel your own centers. If you know how to correct your centers, you can cure yourself and you can cure others also. For your information, in Sahaja Yoga three doctors have got MD.

 [A SECTION IS MISSING FROM THE RECORDED SPEECH]. 

This is not done by anything else but your own inner power. This is all within you and you, yourself can work it out. Like this instrument, if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way, unless and until we are put to the mains, it has no meaning. We have no meaning. So this should happen to us all. Today is the first day and I would be happy if you have any questions, you better ask Me today. Tomorrow I'll tell you how it works out. And after the questions we'll have the session of Self Realization.

Question:  May I ask something?

Shri Mataji: Please... Will you stand up? Will you, please, stand up? 

Question: I stand up
.
 
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

Question: If anyone has AIDS, to cure himself or somebody else just by concentrating on himself or that person, then how comes that Jesus Christ could not do it to all the people He had in front during His life?

Shri Mataji: It is a good question, it's a very good question. Yes, it's a very good question. I would like to answer. First of all, Jesus Christ came on this earth at the time when people were not at all aware, they were not seeking the Truth. You can imagine, He started His work and they hardly allowed Him to live for about three and a half years with that work. And you'll be amazed that when I went to London as My husband was elected for a post, I had to struggle for four years working on several people. It was very difficult. And even when they were seekers, they were seekers of Truth. But He did say that the Resurrection time has to come and that this is the time. 

[There is a lot of confusion, many people talking at once.  Finally a man offers to help clarify the question which was asked by another man.)

Question: You are a Jeevan Mukta? I do not know the term. This was the second question.

Shri Mataji: What was the first one?

Question: And the first one was that, I would like to say...the first question was if Samadhi and all the other terms which are known in Indian philosophy or Buddhism are the same with this Realization which You are talking about.

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course ...Of course, it is the same. Have you read the Patanjali Yoga, such a big book like that? In that they have described of the Nirvichar Samadhi, Nirvikalpa Samadhi and this is what exactly this is to be. Three types. Three types of Samadhi described in Hatha Yoga, all of them you will experience, all right?

Question: Are you a Jeevan Mukta? 

Shri Mataji: All right. That question I would say I will not tell you anything about Myself. You better get your Realization and try to understand Me. The reason is that Christ, Christ was the Son of God, no doubt, but when He said that, they crucified Him. I don't want to say what I am.  I don't want to get crucified.

Question: I was baptized as a Christian. My name is George. If I embrace your Sahaja Yoga practices, shall I go on worshiping Jesus Christ or not?

Shri Mataji: Of course. Without Jesus Christ you cannot get Realization, sir. You'll find out that very soon. Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ is on our Agnya chakra. You see, there is an Agnya Chakra there, where we cross onto the optic chiasm and you will know during your Realization that to open this center you have to forgive everyone. He is the door. He is the path and He is the door and this door has to open. But...

A man from the audience speaks:  I would like to say this: there is one way to get Him and ...the same, and that's through the name of Jesus. Peace in the heart ... in man, in the spirit of man. And that life is ... God is the Creator of the Universe, the Creator of man, is the giver of life, is the Savior of man. He is the One that can make us new. He can save you and can save the men of Romania. .... [at this point the man is speaking stridently, he starts shouting.  Some people in the audience are clapping.  Others are shouting, "Out!  Out!"  The melee continues for some time.]

Shri Mataji continues calmly on the subject of Christ:  Hello! Hello!  It's all right. It's all right. He talked of Christ as if He is in our pocket. When He lived we crucified Him and how can we have crucified Him as Christians? Christ has nothing to do with Christianity, take it from Me. Yes, I'll explain. 

So, I was born in a Christian religion Myself. And I could not understand how Mister Paul is there in the Bible. You see, he organized the whole thing in such a manner that you won't believe it, that people who took the name of Christ killed billions and billions of people in the name of Christ. Thank God, that the Spaniards went to America instead of India. Thank God, by mistake. And they killed all the aboriginals, all of them, in billions. If they had come to India, I would not have been here. Is that what Christ has talked to you? Even in India when they came, they came with a gun in one hand and the Bible in the other. Even in India, these Christians. 

So they have deceived Christ. Christ has said you are to be born again. In Sanskrit language a bird is called as dwijaha, meaning it's born twice, as an egg, as a bird. And an enlightened person is also called as a dwijaha. But you cannot have a false certificate saying that you are born again. There should be no pretensions about it. In Sahaja Yoga, when the Kundalini rises, it is the actualization, actualization of the baptism, not just saying that you are baptized. Now Kundalini, the Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. And what is the Holy Ghost? They told quite a mystery. It is not. You have God Father, God the Son. What about the Mother? Without the Mother where is the Son? Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother. In Christianity they removed the Mother completely.              

Comment from audience: Sorry.

Shri Mataji: No, no, not that way. No, no, no...Mother of Christ is described.

Question: No, No. And in the Bible it's written like that! And we read in the Bible. And that Holy Ghost descended upon Mary.

Shri Mataji: Not that's true. But, you see, but it's not so clear. What I am saying is the Primordial Mother.  It is not so clear, not so clear. What I'm saying, it is not so clear, not so clear. And among the Protestants, they don't even believe. Christ's Mother, they called Her just a woman. But if you do not put blinkers, in the scriptures She's described as the Adi Shakti, as the Primordial Mother.

Now there is a big problem, they don't even want to appoint women as priests - anywhere, whether Protestants or Catholics. So this is - one has to understand, that the Holy Ghost is your Mother, everybody's individual Mother, your individual Mother She is, Holy Mother.  She's your individual Holy Mother. 

And She is the One Who gives you the second birth. So now, that is how you have to prove that what Christ said then is the Truth. If you ask the Jews, they think they are the chosen ones. If you ask the Mussulmans, they say they are the ones. And if you ask the Hindus, they think they are the chosen ones. And the Christians think they are the saved ones. But all of them are capable of doing any sinful thing, any sinful thing. I mean there's no binding force. So what is it that is missing? Why are you not Christ-like? Why are you not really religious, in the sense that people don't do any sinful thing? Because we are not connected with this Power, because we are not been born. Christ has said, "Seek yourself" - that is Self Realization. Nobody does that. Nobody does. All of them are money oriented or power oriented. So how, why will they give you Realization? Because for giving Realization you cannot take money. It's not money oriented.

So one should understand what is reality and then you will understand what Christ has said, that "Those who are not against Me, are with them." Who are those? They did not give chance to Christ to say anything, very little He could speak to them in parables. 

Even today, you see, this gentleman, he was not allowing Me to speak. What good work he has done? What things he has achieved? He cannot even control himself! How can he talk of Christ? 

So now we should decide that we'll take to reality. I will explain to you everything about Christ, about His greatness, also about all others who are His own relations, those who are not against Him at least. And it will be proved. Now, there are many Muslims who are Sahaja Yogis, Jews who are Sahaja Yogis, who follow Sahaja Yoga. Those Jews worship Christ. Why? Because it has been proved.

[SECTION MISSING FROM THE RECORDED SPEECH].
In New York you can't wear anything of gold. I mean they are all dacoits. Sixty percent people are suffering from nervousness, from AIDS, horrible disease is that, drugs, AIDS. You can't find an American with a steady look like yours, they all the time keep shifting.. So, even to bear freedom, you must have wisdom.  You must have wisdom. I would say that Russians are very wise people, despise whatever you may say, whatever it is. But they are wise. Russians! Seventy percent Russians are very wise. And the thirty percent are asking for American jeans and money.

So with Sahaja Yoga you touch your depth and that's, that's how you understand what is good for you, what is benevolence. Also, they've realized, Russians realize that they got their freedom very easily, very easily.

[SECTION MISSING FROM THE RECORDED SPEECH]

All right. That's futuristic. Just now you have your Self Realization. That's a futuristic idea. Just now you better have your Self Realization.

(Another man from the audience is pontificating loudly and at length.)

Please.  Please. Please, be quiet. What he has said is true, but we have not kept to a saintful path. He said, "Seek the Truth and seek yourself". Very clearly, very cleary. When Moses came, the Jews believed in Moses. But they did not believe in Christ when Christ came. When Christ came, those who were around Him never believed. They believed in Moses because Moses did not exist. It is nice to believe in a person who doesn't exist, because you can do what you like. You don't have to obey him.

Now, when I am here to give you Self Realization, you want to believe in Christ. So Christ is not here. I am here. I'm telling you. Why don't you listen to Me now? Because you were born in a Christian a religion, that's why you believe in Christ. Supposing you were born in a Muslim religion, then... or born in a Hindu religion, then... same about Hindus. See, when Shri Rama came, they said they believe in Vishnu Who was long ago. When Krishna came, they said, "We believe in Shri Rama" when He was not. And every time the Person who came, lived, nobody believed. And after a Person was dead, they were making temples, churches, mosques.

So now I am before you and I have come all the way to give you Self Realization. So you should not have this conditioning that you are born a Christian, born a Muslim, born Hindu. These are conditionings. Or you are a Bulgarian, or you are a Romanian. You are a human. Even a Bulgarian and a Romanian or an Indian, you are all human beings. And all human beings have got this inside them. The only advantage is now that once you get Realization, then you won't be conditioned. You'll be in reality. This is absolute reality. So you won't be in the darkness and that is how the whole world can be won. There will be no wars in the name of religion. So let us take to reality which unites us and is so powerful in love. Thank you.

Question: ...So You are the messenger of God.  But how can You do that?

Shri Mataji: See, just now I will not tell you anything about Myself. You have no authority to ask Me Who I am. No. Why should I tell you? I don't want to tell you. I tell you that you take your Realization. 

Okay, let us stop now. This is surprising, I mean nowhere in the world people ask such questions.

[MISSING FROM THE RECORDED SPEECH] 

... away from each other. And we'll tell you first of all, somebody will show you. He will show you. First you have to put your hand on to your heart. But do it without thinking. This is the first state of Samadhi. Now you put your right hand like this.  Put down your head and see with your left hand, see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Keep away from your head. Some people get it far away, some may get it closer. It may be a hot breeze. If you have not forgiven, it will be hot. Now, please, put the left hand towards Me and put down your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out. Don't ...

[MISSING FROM THE RECORDED SPEECH] 

and ask this question three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" "Is this the All Pervading Power of Love?" Ask any one of these questions three times. Now, please, take down your hand. All those who have felt a hot or a cool breeze out of their head or of their hands, or out of their hands, please, raise both your hands. I bow to you all. Again. Can I see it again? I bow to you all again. You have felt for the first time, tomorrow again if you are here and we will have the full knowledge about Kundalini, but don't think about it. It's a living process. Don't argue because it is not down at a mental level. Now enjoy yourself! Thank you very much.
