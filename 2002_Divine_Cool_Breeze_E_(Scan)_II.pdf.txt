 Shri Ganesha Puja Cabella - 22.9.2001 (Pravachana of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi) who have no malice, who are living like little children, I should say, if they are Today we have assembled here to worship Shri Ganesha. Shri Ganesha who is the lord of innocence, He is the attacked by anyone, not that the whole world reacts to that but everyone of them cannot bear any innocent person or innocent being being harmed. You don't ocean of innocence and though He is such a young little boy He can fight the whole world, He can destroy all the negativity. That's the sign of innocence. realise that within us there is the ocean of love and ocean of understanding for There have been stories that children who have fallen from very great height children. Why? Why should it be? Why they were completely saved; nothing should we feel like that specially for happened. Their innocence is such a children, specially for innocence! There powerful thing that it doesn't harm are people who are always attacking anyone who is not to be harmed. It has innocent people, innocent children, there all the wisdom of the world, all the are, but no one wants to support them, understanding of the world and any body no one thinks that it's proper to ill-treat who tries to harm the innocence, the children and those who have done this whole world which may not have cared have to suffer. They all suffer as a so much for innocence, might not have worshipped innocence so much but they all stand, stand-up against anybody who tries to harm the innocence. You can see reaction. What is it within us that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction against innocence? For example, if there is a regular war and if there are people fighting in a regular war, they don't have much sympathy and the world also. They your own lives around anybody tries to trouble children, all of them whatever in say alright, they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing. The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged. they are, whatever they are coming from, whatever may be there nationality, they all jump-all jump to control and to safeguard that child. That's what human beings have-within What is it? What is it within us that themselves they have the power, power make us so very conscious to protect the of Shri Ganesha which gives you that innocence! It's a really shame, great feeling, that capacity, that understanding, shame for us when we find in this world that you have to protect innocent that innocence is under attack. Anything children, innocent people and the whole. else can be tolerated-innocent people world can rise against all such people who are trying to kill the innocent. There who have done nothing wrong, those

They should not feel dejected if they are being used, a thing then they are not yet human insulted, tortured, dominated. It's alright. beings, I would say. The highest They should not try to destroy the personality can sacrifice anything and innocence of other people, of anyane. can give up anything but they can not Automatically it would work out. You will give up the feeling they have for be amazed that when innocence is innocence. It's very remarkable, we don't charged all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that. Example of protection and love for the innocent. this is the recent war, so called war, of oppose such an attack or criticise such realise, how much there is this ocean of What attracts the greatest strength is America where innocent people, they when we see innocent person, innocent had done nothing wrong, have been children are under attack. That's the tortured, have been killed. At that time, beauty of human beings. Of-course there are many human beings who can be every country whetherit believes in those cruel, who are i would say, I call them people or not is anxious to look after devils, may be, but when it comes to those who have done this crime. They children and to innocent people, may not be belonging to the same everyone feels it a responsibility. It' s religion, they may not be belonging to difficult for normal human beings to be innocent because they have a kind of a belonging to the same cults but at this understanding that they are something moment who does not take the side of great, that they understand everything, the innocence will be singled out and will that they can analyse everything and be destroyed, no doubt about it. Once they could be crooks, they could be aggressive, they could be troublesome, can not attack innocent people. they could be anything and they can give explanation for that, doesn't matter. But still on the whole they can never be should not ever be annoyed with our respected and they can never be children, we should not in no way punish honoured for the thing they are doing. all over the world, it is a big support, the same country, they may not be for all they will learn a lesson that you I have told you, in Sahaja yoga we them. Our main achievement should be that loving attention for children. All over the world whether he belongs to your family or to some other family or has some sort of detached attention with you, still because he is a child, he is innocent, the innocence within itself, your own innocence will try to protect him. It's very For us, the Sahaja yogis, the Sahaja culture is to respect your innocence. You might feel little bit cheated, you might feel little bit dominated, you might feel little bit disgraced, but Sahaja yogis have to be innocent because with them lies the

 March - April 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 that is put within us by the Divine. We play with innocence very much, we think that by behaving anyway we like, it's alright after all it's my own desire, my wish and we go on, we go on all the time reducing our power or we can say hiding or covering our power of innocence and we think we have done a great job that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature! This tricky nature can not give you any satisfaction, it is not self sufficient. When you try to trick someone surprising how people take to sacrificing the lives when it comes to the attack of innocence! Children should never be attacked. They have their own power to protect, no doubt, but you shouldn't waste your energy on something that is extremely inauspicious, extremly cruel and extremely ugly. If you cannot love children, you can not love anything. I have not come across anyone so far who says that they don't love children. Luckily, but may be, some might say that we love flowers. Why? Why you love flowers? Because they are innocent, because that beauty of innocence is within them. You this trick works on you, it is repelled on you and destroys your faith in innocence which is the greatest faith; greatest help love nature, why? Because it is innocent. or the greatest power on this earth. Those people who do not respect their innocence because they think it makes you weak have not seen the power of innocence, how it works, how it acts. But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings who are Sahaja yogis. It's easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning, it's very easy to be clever but to be wise one should understand From all over the world it reacts but so the beauty of being innocent. Possibly far, I think, the human beings are not one may say, Mother, one can get conscious of the power of innocence, exploited if you are innocent. No one can exploit an innocent person. They may believe that they have done this, they whole working out of the being is so have been very aggressive and all that beautifully achieved. but they cannot. It is like a rock, it is like a rock that is not derailed by any ocean that it is the highest thing to be innocent, and it acts as if the whole understanding, Now you see in this world what saves, what people remember, what is respected-is the high ideals. But if you see to the subtle side of all these high of anger or any kind of revenge. It is the rock that is being looked after and nourished by Shri Ganesha. I have told ideals of people, they have lived a very- before also that the innocence within you us never gets destroyed, very surprising! very beautifull life, of very good You may be a sinner, you may be a very character, of very good nature. All these cruel person, you might be anything people may have been harmed, may but it doesn't get it cannot get it after have been killed but because of their innocence they shine and shine through innocence. It is a very-very secret thing

They are all very simple, respects, nobody says that look at that, they are not delibrately spontaneous how he was crucified? What has he in their behaviour, done? Nothing of the kind. They just respect and what do they respect the essence, the essence of complete innocence. You say in Sahaja yoga that He was the incarnation of innocence, He they are spontaneously they live. Nations after nations can be destroyed but the power of innocence can not be destroyed. Have faith in that. You have to have complete faith in your Self and that your Self is nothing but innocence. You may say that innocent people get cheated. Nobody can cheat innocent people because that is something of very eternal value. They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something but the thing that is the most elernal is your innocence and you will be the most successful person in life when you are absolutely innocent and They are stupid not to understand who you are looking after your innocence. was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha, which can be verified. So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like and we don't want to even remember that, we don't want to even consider that it's a wrong thing to do, we do not know what is ahead of us. What happened to Hitler also? He thought he can destroy the whole world, he can manage to kill so many people and stil he will remain a very great personality. are the people really respected? Through ages, through history-no one like Hitler, He didn't understand if he wanted to have really the power of the As I have told you that innocence never gets destroyed. It can be covered by your ill thoughts, by ill doing it might world and if he wanted to have a be covered for the time being but if you reputation of a great man, he should can take out the clouds away from the have followed the great people and the sky of innocence, the whole thing great people are those who are innocent. becomes so obvious that you have won Their main power is their innocence. the whole world, You can take the case Take any one of them. I don't know how of Christ. He was crucified. He was to say that this power acts because it insulted, He was tortured, those who did acts in so many ways. You can pass this where are they? Who knows them? through the historical events, so many of them and what would you find? A person who is so innocent, simple and wise is remembered all your life. I was a child very small when I was in school I Nobody even knew the name, nobody is even bothered about them. The single one person was so much used and was so much tortured but despite that what used to go to the library and read about has happened! He has got the respect,

 March April 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Isue 3 & 4 that you have big authorities or you have a very big position as ministers and all that. There have been so many who the lives of great men who have created some great things for us. So many of them and I was so impressed how some came and died. There had been so many of them were so simple, so child-like. For example Abraham Lincoln for whom I people with ambitions and so many had tremendous respect was a man people who were oppressive but where are they? No body is bothered about don't know you are very clumsy, you them, nobody wants to look at them. If their photographs appear, people close know how to behave and she actually their eyes, no-no we don't want to see this man, but if there's a little boy, innocent child who is talking in a very tortured by his wife also! She said, you don't know how to dress up, you don't was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him. Ultimately he was killed. So one can say see what's the use of being Abraham Lincoln because he was killed, he was not successful. But till today all over the world people know who was Abraham Lincoln. They don't innocent manner, the whole world admires that child and these great men are really the symbols of that innocence. Their main quality was innocence from where the wisdom has come. know his wife, but they know who was Abraham Lincoln. Clumsy man, Ganesha's main quality is his wisdom. He knew what was success through His, I should say, innocent qualities. Some according to her and all sorts of degradation for him but nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her. Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln. Why? Actually he was murdered, he was killed. That shows that times the innocent people are not even aware of their quality of innocence. It's very surprising! How the quality of innocence shines through human beings he had no strength to survive; but he survived through ages. So many years very simple, who may not look so have passed still he is surviving. Take intelligent and sharp, who do not become the case of all the great people who have good diplomats, what ever it is they are been innocent and that's why they had innocent. That's where ends all the glory ideals. To them their ideals were more of human beings to be innocent. important than anything else, even their lives, everything was nothing. Now the sense of ideals and idealism comes only People will say, Mother what do we do who may be very ordinary, who may be So to be innocent, what will you do? to be innocent? Firstly, you can see for from your innocence. That's the one yourself how yourmind works, what does which teaches you what is your ideal? How you should exist? What kind of a life you should lead? It's not important it do, how it reacts? This is what one has to watch, which I call as introspection.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 March April 2002 What sort of plans your mind take to? anything what so ever to an innocent. What does it think is the best? In that personality. There's a sanskrit shloka like thinking, the thought process, what is the most important way to look at yourself. the spirit -it can not be killed by anyone The first and the foremost is that you should know how you react. Is it an innocent reaction or it is a vindictive shoshatey Maruta Maruta" is the air or reaction? It's very easy to see yourself what you can call, a wind, wind cannot because now you are all Sahaja yogis. also suck it. It is above all the nature You can see for yourself how is your which is trying to destroy. But you will reaction to any aggression on you or any be amazed that nature understands, I kind of a trouble coming on you. How do told you nature is that "Nainam Chhidyanti Shastrani", for "Nainam dahayati Pavka" - no fire can burn it, "Na Chainam Kleid yantapo, na innocent. It you react to that? What is your understands and it acts at the right behaviour? If you are a very powerful moment. Again the person who is person then your behaviour is that you aggressive, who is trying to malign or are not bothered. "You see it for yourself trouble an innocent person. In this way that it is just a stupid thing people are we should know that we have to worship doing to you, absolutely stupid and when our innocence. they are doing stupid things, why should we bother about it, why should we waste I know sometimes one feels that you are dominated because of that our energy about it? It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards they are treated with contempt. People don't even want to take their names, they don't want to have their photographs, they don't have to have anything to do with them. sometimes one feels sad that why you are put to this kind of a treatment by others? All kinds of things come to your mind but if you worship your innocence then you will be always a happy person, always a kind person, always be a humble person. So one has to be careful. You are your own destroyer, you are the one who kills yourself. What do you say to Hitler? Hitler destroyed himself, who else destroyed him? I mean in anyway everybody has to die, so he would have been dead but who destroyed him At this time, at such a juncture what happens is the people who are crooks who are not innocent, who are against innocence, they start following them because it suits them better, it suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning and forever is himself. So you kill yourself. that's how a new group is formed which Through this you can save yourself and we can call as satanic group and this can become very glorified if you are satanic group also cannot do anything, innocent, have faith in the power of

 March - April 2002 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 innocence. What is important is how you show in your life the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other and that is what I call the love. You cannot be compassionate unless and until you have this attitude towards yourself, you cannot be kind, temporarily you might feel this but permanently compassionate we will stop it. You must send your, what you call, your applications at least 8 days before and for Ganapatipule it is two week so otherwise there are only twenty four hours in a day and you cannot increase those. Now this one humble request I have to make that if you want to settle your marriage then please do it in a way that I can have time to see. Otherwise I will leave it to others to decide. If you like it can be done. So a simple thing is this to understand that marriage is a very important thing. You can create innocent children if you are temprament comes only through the permanent flowing of innocence through your character. It's such a transparent thing in a human being that it sustains, it overpowers all other things, leave alone the time. Thousands of years people will married. But if you behave in this manner, little irresponsible so I have to not forget you, the Sahaja yogis, if you show your valour and the strength of your request you to understand the value of time because from next time I can assure innocence. I am sorry for today's programme being so late but you know I was ready to come but the marriages are becoming you we cannot have marriages if you send your applications so late. It should be within one week's time. I hope you the main function now because it came will understand. so late that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages. But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time Thank you very much Common looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lord makes so many of them. Abraham Lincoln

 Navaratri Puja Loutraki, Greece, 21.10.2001 (Pravachana of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi) Today we have gathered here to do And that point has arrived where all the Devi Puja. This Puja was the good people, especially the Sahaja performed many a times and the Devi Yogis should put all their mind to the was requested by the Devas to save destruction of them from the tyranny of devilish personalities like Mahishasura. people. Today I feel the same way, these horrible In those days, it was very simple because devils came as devils and situation; that there are people who you could see them that they are are themselves devils, I think, and also devils, and all their behaviour proved that we are now in the grip of a funny mesmerised by them who are trying that they were devils. Why they did it? to do something which they should Why were they cruel? Because so called 'human beings', as they are, never have done. But they don't know that there is a climax of everything. they are not, they are by nature

Because they It is evident that the time has always had sinister practices by which come for them to be destroyed. they used to treat others. In no way I could be against Islam or ever to criticise Mohammed Saheb. He was Divine, no doubt, and tried to I never knew that it will come up to that stage. And mostly they were from Afghanistan, can you imagine? Mostly. Of course they tortured other Afghanis also; and where-ever they went, they had a speciality that they could be very do Divine work. But out of that Divine work these stupid people have come up who accept those devilish people. You will be amazed to know that in cruel. Not all Afghanis, no, not at all, Islam there are seventy-four groups! but some of them. And they came to They say, "We follow one religion" - India from Afghanistan and we have but they do not. Out of these, some of different types of Afghanis. Some were them are really evil people, and they very loving, kind, helpful, very nice call themselves by the name as people. And some of them were very Devbandis because this is a place in cruel. First we didn't understand what India, and also they are called as is this. But because my father was a Wahabees. I have been knowing them scholar and scholar of Islam. He told since long because in our household, us "These are not Islamic. They call in my father's household, we had lots of Muslim people working as cooks, as drivers, as other servants. And these themselves Wahabees and they are not Islamic". I can see that today, so clearly. Wahabees are very interesting people Not that in other religions or in other because they don't believe even in groups there are no mad people. But these Wahabees were secretly Mohammed Saheb. So if you tell them that Mohammed Saheb has said such- and-such a thing, they say "No, we working out different groups. They are don't believe in Mohammed Saheb". not many. And that's what my father "So, in whom do you believe?" "We had told me that "One day they will become very explosive and they might try to ruin the world completely" At first, I couldn't understand, believe in Allah!" "Have you met Allah? Have you seen Him, that you are believing in Him?" But in their whole

But mostly they told me, "They are absolutely were the people who were interested camouflaged, and once they start their in money, in getting lots of money, somehow, in the name of religion. But cruelty you will not know what to do." at that time, people didn't see their cruel methods and their cruelties. We had one invader in our country called as Mohammed Shah Abdali. He This cruelty started growing and was a very, very cruel man, very cruel, and he used to even kill the Muslims you know we have Nizamuddin Aulia's dargah. In that been to because his concept was that you place only, I discovered, there's a Madarsa - 'Madarsa' means a 'school'. should not worship Mohammed Saheb because Mohammed Saheb said that "I am not Divine". I also used to say the And in that school they used to admit same, to save myself from the stupid small children. And it was so well people. For years I used to say, "I am planned that God only knows - I mean not Divine", but when they felt My I can't say, that there were 120 vibrations and all that, they believed. Madarsas only in Delhi! Now nobody But those who believed in Mohammed knew what they are teachig there, Saheb were never understood by what they are mesmerising, how they these people. Very, very cruel, and are doing this! It so happened once, I because they don't even believe in Mohammed Saheb, you cannot argue there I found people singing songs and with them on any point; you cannot argue with them what is written in feeling for love. They felt my love very the Koran because you don't believe in much, all of them, and they started went to this place, Nizamuddin, and all that. And I found in them a real Koran, you don't believe in Mohammed Saheb, you believe in know there was a Madarsa in that coming to Sahaja Yoga. But I didn't Allah. God knows from where do place. I asked them "Why is it, here the they have connections! vibrations, Nizamuddin was an Aulia. But gradually it was surprising that And how is it that the place doesn't they could mesmerise. As we have have good vibrations?" In between t horrible gurus who come as gurus and used to get very bad vibrations. So they mesmerise. You have seen them, they told me "Mother, there is a people being mesmerised. So many Madarsa".

In those Madarsas only, they had you are supposed to be a Muslim, what will come out of you? people who used to tell them how to be cruel, how to hate. So 'education in hatred' started. And that education of and Islam got divided into many So, all these wrong ideas grew up hatred was very well woven through groups. It's alright, but to have this these Madarsas, all over the world. kind of a group that is against all Now, as you know, Pakistan and India humanity was the most dangerous were always fighting. But this plan! I don't know how many Muslims time Pakistanis realised that If we also knew about it. They spread this fight with India in that way we will Madarsa thing all over the world and be called as terrorists'. So they people coming out of that institution said "No, we will have no terrorism became very, very cruel people. The first cruelty was to the women. Women in our country".

It's complete innocence, simple existence Now, in Sahaja Yoga, you believe in not written in Koran, it's not described together. And that people believe that by Mohammed Saheb. He says "God there is definitely different groups of is merciful; He is peace-giving". people. Now what is our duty? What are we supposed to do? First of all, we have to introspect. Supposing you are a Hindu, born. You should sit down and find out if you hate anybody Whatever he did was absolutely Divine, no doubt. But some of these people, the way they took to satanic forces, people started because he's a Muslim. You cannot misunderstanding Islam. hate because you are Muslim, "Islam' means 'to surrender'. Those because you are surrendered, so how who are surrendered are you people. can you hate anyone? If you are surrendered, you are surrendered to the Divine, and how can you then be Surrendered means those who have given up all their lust, greed and all these enemies, and are above against the Divine? So these normal people. Another thing, it was misleading thoughts and ideas should very interesting to note that be given up. Supposing you are a Mohammed Saheb had said that "At Hindu. So you have no business to the time of resurrection, your hands hate anyone. That is for definite! Now would speak". That he clearly said. the word 'Hindu' also comes from the Naturally, because it was written in a River Sindhu because Alexander language which was all poetic, people couldn't say 'Sindhu', so he said can, if they want to, they can twist it. "Hindu'. And on that point many people have built this horrible hatred in India. But Mohammed Saheb never, never But cruelty was not their theme. That could have said... that. was the saving point that they didn't It's very, very shocking that in these want to torture people. So this aptitude modern times the people have taken to torture or to hate people is coming to such crooked ideas. But for that, the from other sources. And the source is, reason is that people also develop as you can see clearly, that they resistance for them. Jews they openly hate. To hate is a very bad develped a resistance for them. This quality. One of the most dangerous hatred is responsible, and this hatred, things is to hate. And so you all must between both the sides, I would say, know... (short pause) alright. Now we are having a puja. now, is too difficult. It's very evident.

 March - April 2002 13 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 My heart just weeps. At what time I we human beings, we hate others, have come on this earth, where I have when you know that love is such an to see human beings hating each overwhelming, beautiful feeling. But other! They talk of 'love and 'hate'. It's a very serious thing, that you who are To me, it is very painful to think that why then do you take to hatred? the children of one God, they'll end up like this I mean, I have experiences that if I tell you you'll be shocked. How Because people have impressed you, they have told you lies, that's why you hate. What an achievement! First to be a human being, and then to be a people have fallen down to the depth person full of hatred! Now what will be the next, I don't know! of evil nature. It's an understanding we have, to It was alright in those days for the have understanding about ourselves: Do we hate somebody? Do we get Goddess to kill. The Goddess used to ideas that we shouldn't have, or do kill all such people... (long pause).. It's a very sad feeling that God has things? Do you have such things in created human beings from amoeba to you? Just find out! Do you hate other this stage, and how can we hate people? someone? And this is what has These ideas are rotten, absolutely, happened! for the human mind. The ideas which are completely like the animals instinct, are absolutely no good for Now of course Sahaja is different. Sahajis know how to enjoy the Love. human beings at all. But that is what is They like it. They enjoy it. You can see happening, and it's coming forward. If you are poor, alright, but by hating you don't become rich, no. If you are in any that. And if somehow, you people could manage to remove this hatred- somehow, somehow - with your wn difficulties, then your duty is to remove will-power- denying and defying all that is being told to human beings, I those difficulties, but not to prosper on am sure.. (long pause).. It's a very them. All this has to finish. It is very surprising that we are not bothered at all as to what we are doing. Yes, you difficult world where those people who came on this earth went through all kinds of education, wanted to improve have to have proper sense of understanding: where are we going? If the conditions, the relationships, friendships, have fallen into the depths of hatred.. (long pause)... you have misunderstanding about somebody, better take it out,

All our activities as Sahaja lurking some kind of a weakness that we do not try to fight our weakness. I would now request you all to Yogis, I never realised were so important! We have to give so much time. Not to bother about nonsensical, meditate on yourself, and see for frivolous things, but something serious yourself what is wrong. that is within us or without, that must be taken out.

But we must develop that power in our hearts. Think of it! It's we going to do, the Sahaja Yogis! What are their plans? Will you please look into yourself and think what a big lesson now for all of us, to see for constructive work we are doing and ourselves - are we alright?

 Shri Krishna Puja Saffron, U.K. ,14.8.89 Pravachana of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Today we have gathered to worship Shri Krishna's incarnation. Shri Sita back from Ravana. So Shri Rama sent her away. How many people who are in power would be that sensible Narayana, of Shri Vishnu. In every that they must set an example by their incarnation they carry all their behaviour in a manner that they qualities, powers and all their nature should be ideals for all other people with them. So when he incarnated he who are working under them. Shri had all the qualities of Narayana and Sitaji was Mahalaxmi. She understood the whole play and she went away. Krishna is the incarnation of Shri Shri Rama. Every incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their previous As a king Shri Rama taught how to rule the people. He established the ideals of kingship and it is said that the incarnation was misunderstood or carried out to the extremes. That's why they come back again and again. Shri Vishnu is the preserver of creation and Dharma. Sb when he took his most ideal kingdom was Rama Rajya. Under his rule there was peace, no incarnation he had to see that people competition, every one was joyous abide by their Dharma. You have to and happy because he emitted fair get your realisation to keep alright and play, Dharma, joy, bliss and peace. remain in the central path of Shri Mahalaxmi. By the first incarnation we can say that he tried to create a benevolent king as Shri Rama. But people always take to something which is not normal in the case of each incarnation. Because Shri Rama lived as an ascetic, people started following ascetism. People became austere, would not laugh or smile. Everything became very serious. As people did incarnated as a complete human not marry, they lost balance. Marriage being with all the qualities of human gives you balance. That is the time beings. He married the Laxmi principle Shri Krishna incarnated to show that that is Shri Sitaji. He lived a normal the whole creation is fun, is leela. married life. Then he gave her up and There is nothing to be serious, dry or lived like an ascetic. By his life he ascetic. Infact before Shri Rama's time showed how a husband should be with all the saints used to marry. Then also his wife. Later on he had another role a kind of funny brahaminism started. to play as a king. When he became the They weakened the caste system which was determined by birth rather Shri Rama was Purushotamma - the best among human beings. He king he found out that people were criticizing him because he brought Shri than work. The Brahmins started

In the Orient they enjoy When Shri Krishna was only five, he the naughtiness of the children. The played all kinds of pranks and did all kinds of leelas like he killed one big because people do not love their cobra snake, he killed many demons with his power in a play. Shri Rama was not supposed to know that he was an incarnation. Even though it was revealed to him by various methods that he was an incarnation yet he would not accept it because he was not supposed to know. Something like Mahamaya. In the same way all the Shri Krishna used to steal the butter of cameras are now giving you all the strictness with the children is mostly children. They love their carpets and other material things because they can sell it. They can't sell their children. As children and parents are separated by materialistic ideas, the material things become more important. Now stealing is considered bad, but all the ladies, who used to take it to a evidence of the real Mahamaya, what demon in Mathura. This butter was she is like, but one may try to show that you don't remember, you have no memory of it. Because if you that the ladies won't be able to sell it remember it, your action would not be human. They would become Divine there. Also if you see the significance- actions and that may not be alright for human beings because they will not be able to stand it, they will be frightened, eaten by all the demons and they were becoming very powerful. So he thought better to eat all the butter so we starve our children just to have some money. Money orientation is there with the idea that everything is to he sold. So children become a there will be such an awe. So Shri Krishna behaved normally like a very ordinary person. permanent liability. Children are treated as if they are just burdens. If all the value system just comes down to money then children have no place in the family. According to Sahaja yoga, children are more imporant than all the wealth of the world and they are to be looked after that way. Of-course they should know what is dignity and how to In his childhood he was very fond of butter. Butter is very good for the Vishuddhi Chakra. In the tea add a little butter so that the throat which is dried out gets relief. With the help of his friends he would break the containers and eat all the butter. Then behave themselves but their little little he would tell little little lies. All his pranks are to be understood and pranks, childish sweet lies, were just to create a feeling of understanding. play pranks and not as grown ups. When children are naughty like that They should have that much freedom enjoyed. Only as children they can

Shri Krishna defeated the king and released these to play pranks and tricks otherwise and might become ascetics. Those parents who are very strict with their children are never normal. They either women and gave them his protection are extremely perverse or they quieten down and cannot face life. Both are of by marrying them. When we have Vishuddhi problems the same style; one cannot face life and the other cannot be faced by life. we have to know what are the dieties on both the sides and what are the You have to treat your children with qualities which are lacking in us that great love and understanding, but they we are suffering. Let's see right side should know that if they misbehave, this love will be finished. Children only Krishna's essence is sweetness. His Vishudhi when we catch. Shri power was Radha. Ra energy, dha- the one who sustains the energy and care for love, they don't know money or anything else. The love you establish in your child becomes a very precious thing. Sahaja yoga is based qualities. Shri Krishna's quality was on Divine love and it can only work when people are loving. If they love his power was Allahd joy giving that he was Yogeshwara the eternal witness. Now a person who shouts money, power or their reputation etc. and not their own children or family his temper, suffers from right then they are losing a very big part of their society. and screams, talks loudly and loses Vishuddhi. One should understand that even if we have to scold somebody we have to say 'what are you doing', in a sweet manner. The best is to give some rest to the right As a king Shri Krishna wanted to establish people in dharma and he needed the help of the five elements. So he made them into five ladies whom he married. But they are the Vishuddhi by observing silence 'mauna'. On the right side the heat starts was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached coming from the liver. It starts rising, in his yoga but for all practical first it goes to the right heart. As purposes he had five wives and then result you might become a very hot there were sixteen thousand women tempered husband or father. Then it passes to the right Vishuddhi and you become a very irritable, hot-tempered person, all the time shouting at others. very part and parcel of his being. He who became his wives, who were nothing but his sixteen thousand powers. The Vishuddhi chakra has got sixteen petals, multiplied by the Virata's 1000 petals, it comes to 16000 If you use your anger in that manner then that person may be just

 The Divine Cool Breeze olume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 March - April 2002 20 frightened of you, might develop an inferiority complex, might become a left sided person. God alone knows what can happen to a person who has somebody all the time shouting at him! or any particular person. So there is no need to shout, play around with it and bring it to that point which is benevolence. Shri Krishna said, you have to tell the truth, but it should also From Shri Krishna's life we have to be pleasing and it should be for the learn how he used to play the flute and benevolence. Supposing you tell the how the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely quiet without any truth to someone he may not like it at the moment but if it is for his ripple. But in modern times they have benevolence then in the long run he the other way round where the right Vishuddhi is about to break or burst. you tried to help him. Even if you have where the music does not bring peace will feel a great obligation to you that to tell some lies for benevolence, does not matter because Shri Krishna, who but excites you more and more. Such music numbs the limbic area which is is the diety, knows it. the seat of the Virata, aspect of Shri Krishna. From the right Vishuddhi it what is wrong with them, specially goes to the Sahasrara, then you take those whom you are incharge like drugs because your brain is numbed. Then again you feel the drug is not frankly tell them what is right. It is your sufficient, you take stronger drugs. duty. People escape it also. Many You go on like this, ultimately you people who don't want to face their reach a stage where you are no where. children give them toys after toys. Where it is all self destructive. You cannot shirk from telling people your family, relations etc, It is best to Discipline domination but it means whatever does not mean Shri Krishna was a divine diplomat. What is divine diplomacy? You don't have to shout. If you want to spirit and the spirit of others. That bring somebody conclusion then the best thing is to first change the subject. That's a clever thing to do. To have a we do is for the benevolence of your is Sahaja discipline. to some Left Vishudhi is the lightening like a person who can scream and shout and who can expose others as did complete. rapport with the person Vishnumaya. You should not be afraid 'how can I do it'? Mostly the people One has to know that the essence of who feel guilty have lost confidence all this diplomacy is Benevolence. You and the ego has entered the left side. have to achieve the benevolence of It's a very complicated situation. We one has to play with that person. the whole humanity. If you are doing it should be on the look out that we are you are not doing it for your own gain, not feeling guilty. Guilt is just a myth.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 March April 2002 21 We want to escape reality that's why guilty, who are suffering from we say we are guilty. You have to face inferiority complex, who are sly, who feel they are good for nothing. See the contrast. Her power expresses in a the reality. Try to find out what's wrong with you and others. Because Vishnumaya is nothing but like electricity. Electricity exposes people, then she asserts her power by which she screams and shouts at people, people become self confident. person who is not self confident and roars at people. If you have a left Vishuddhi you have to use these When we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know that she is seated there. Any moment we decide we can become great speakers, we can methods. The person who has a left vishuddhi should go to the sea and address the sea, "I am the Lord of the expose people, we can be like lightening, we can be like thunder but normally we are not. So this gives balance to both types of people. In the sea, I am this, I am that", loudly. The power of Shri Krishna in the right side of the throat is over the vocal cords the power of sweetness. The same thing happens with Vishnumaya too. Vishnumaya is the potential power but she uses it to scream and shout, to centre when the kundalini rises most of the people have their vishuddhi caught up, so they have to see that they are not guilty, that they are completely themselves, that they are in the central balance in with show her existence that she is there. Now all these miraculous photographs you get are because of Vishnumaya. path by which they become sweet, kind and nice. There are many people She is the one who acts as electricity and she is the one who manages all who are artificially sweet to exploit others. Such people will go to hell because they are using the power of Shri Krishna in a very absurd manner. these things. Though she is the sister of Shri Krishna, she is very subtle and she helps you in a subtle manner. Now this microphone has electricity in it and you will be surprised that vibrations that our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear. are passing through it. From here they First of all we must have a very are going anywhere you want them to beautiful and a clear heart where there go. You can put a computer on the other side and computerise them. It is melodious music. Improve your such a remarkable thing that the one Vishuddhi, work it out, look at the who is supposed to scream and shout Virata and find out what's wrong with and roar is the one who is on the left you and correct it for it cannot be done hand side so that it exists in a potential by any one else. See that you have a way in the people who are feeling full idea about yourself. That can only It is important for us to understand is the frangrance of Shri Krishna's

 March - April 2002 22 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 the brain. So Shri Narayana enters in otherwise you can never see yourself the brain becomes as Virata Akbar. because at the vishuddhi point only When he becomes Akbar then he is the brain in the matter. That is why achieved the witness state then you people who worship Shri Krishna become brainy people without ego. Their brain develops and they have no happen if you have a good vishuddhi you become the witness. If you have can see in your vishuddhi, what's wrong with you, what's wrong with your problem, with your atmosphere ego about it. Egoless intelligence and everything. So today when we are worshipping Shri Krishna, we should manifesting. know that he ultimately becomes the brain. The fat of the stomach goes in which I call as pure intelligence starts May God Bless you

You do not judge God from the can talk about God because they think religions is to find the eternal and to there is no law that can catch them. They can talk for Him, against Him or treat the transitory in its own understanding and its limitations. they can do what they like. They can even make money by talking against That's why we have lost our balance. If God and against all the Prophets. we are really the people who want to know the truth, we have to know that at human awareness we cannot know it. So first of all we have to be a little independent to be free. To know that if It becomes a concept. You have to have the spiritual awareness.

This works out when So what happens in the second centre is for aesthetics and for creativity. My brother, a chartered In our freedom, we do all kinds of accountant, was very bad at all the things which may not be benevolent languages. Now he's making poetry in for ourselves. Doesn't matter.

Around it are ten valencies, our innate religion start feeling on your central nervous system. You start feeling on your finger tips. Like somebody came and said to me - my Agya is catching. It means, I've got my ego on. Would spreads in this centre. Overnight anybody say like that? On the contrary people have given up drugs. Overnight if you tell somebody you've got an ego, they give up alcohalism, everything. they'll show you that they have their ego on. It's very dangerous to say to somebody your ego is on. But because of self-knowledge you know that Mr. Ego is sitting here and I cannot cross day you have a hangover. Here you through, as there's a blockage here take something and next day you are which I have to take out. within ourselves. This Nabhi Chakra or solar plexus gives us religiousness as soon as Kundalini rises and the light And the best part is that they enjoy their virtues. Some people think then what is the fun, what is this that you take something in the pub and the next much better off. It never comes down. It never gives you a reaction. Its not artificial. It's not intoxicating. It's from It 's so innate within you and once the connection is made, immediately you, it's bubbling out. you know about yourself and this centre which is responsible for creating all kinds of funny thoughts enjoy our generosity. Now all matter and horrible creativity, becomes so whatever it is, we are materialistic. But benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful. the aesthetics of matter is that you can Apart from that these people who give it to others suggesting your love in could not say one word in the Hindi it. That's the only thing that matter can language, they have started singing in do and in a very special way you can Sanskrit. So in Sahaja Yoga an artist express that love. The feelings that you who is struggling today may become a great artist. But still I would say there are temptations. You'll become a great artist, you'll start earning more Here we have a capacity that we have expressed of knowing what that person would love and this kind of a depth develops within you with such a lovable beautiful society, you enter into

Those days Now diabetes you do not get by taking too much sugar. In India, in the become like that. Very beautiful villages, you see that they take sugar people, very affectionate, and very in such a manner that the spoon stands up in the cup. But they néver get diabetes. The reason is that the villager doesn't think of tomorrow. He just works hard, eats his food and sleeps off. He doesn't take sleeping pills either. So this diabetes comes by are gone. Now automatically you glorious. See the glow on the face of Sahaja Yogis. The face itself is radiant. Many people drop out ten to twenty years in their age and they are so enthusiastic. They never get tired. Specially in the west people get very easily tired. Young people too. Why are you tired? Because we think too much. All energy is wasted in thinking, so no energy is left to enjoy anything whatsoever. For example you invite people for dinner. You think what to drink, how to make over thinking and can be easily cured if you take to Sahaja Yoga. Then the third disease which is even more dangerous is blood cancer. Blood cancer is caused only to people who think too much. It can even be to the children if the mother is very meticulous. Particularly about her carpets, her house, everything, that the food warmer, what to do, etc. etc., so agitated and so nervous about the

 Puja at Alibaug 17.12.89 (Pravachana of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi) Welcome to you all. So now we do not react then your thoughts will have all arrived here and we are going give up. to start this pilgrimage by travelling together. The journey is of a very subtle nature and if you realize why we watch yourself that you are not are here, you will realize that the whole reacting. But you are experiencing nation is watching you all, is trying to help you that you should ascend and subtieties, the beauty, the glory of that you should feel your depth and your being as well as, whatever is thus enjoy yourself. The travel may not around you. You don't have to force be very comfortable. The roads are yourself to break this habit but just to bad etc. It is a journey of our ascent. So the first thing should be to and enjoying the silence, the be on the watch out. It is not necessary to talk too much about it also. Nor is it In the West we have become very necessary to think about anything, because supposing you see a tree, so it is a tree only. What are we going to speedy and to bring down this speed we have to use meditative process so think about it? And whatever we may that we feel our peace within ourselves. Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds and we react think about it, its going to be the tree. So there's no harm in appearing a little bit stupid doesn't matter. The basic thing is that when we start analyzing very fast to others and to these thoughts. So one has to be aware, one has to know what is happening within yourself. That the thoughts are bombarding you. You are trying to ascend and you find it very difficult to analysis, without thinking about it, get rid of the thoughts. The thought process can start by your conditioning or by your ego. These you watch everything without reacting, are the only two problems. You are you are in Reality. And then only the the one who is under the challenge. So penetration into the subtleties of your you have got these simple people in surroundings, of your relationships, the village who start watching your friendships, the whole universe everything but they do not react. If you dawns upon you. we are breaking our own nerves and poisoning our own mind and brain. So to watch something without is Reality. If you can achieve that point, where

 March - April 2002 31 The Divine Cool Breeze Valume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 you. When you say I have to tolerate it because, you see, my mind doesn't accept. So accept as it is, whatever you see; that is how people grow. That's why I have said that in this pilgrimage, the first thing that we have to remember is that we have to be aware ourselves. But when you are only thinking about others, how others I have seen those who start have to behave, they should do like this or that, leave it to your leaders to accepting, that's the sign of their strength and their depth. Like the break their heads. That's not your job. propensity of this Mother Earth. She is what she is and she bears whatever is it is a headache for them I know but they have to do it. Why do you want to break your heads for nothing at all? So there. If you put a heavy thing on her, to judge others, to think of others, what She will put an equal and opposite they are doing what's wrong with them, about anything whatsoever you force and bear it. She doesn't say I am tolerating it. But, she is just accepting may think is wrong - is not going to be t. So the witnessing and awareness corrected. Like I know some people develops when we start just who are specially bureaucrats. They accepting things as they are. "I are travelling, supposing, by the car. Then they will say, "I think, you see this road should have gone this way, or I think it should have been nice if this house was facing the other way Now I like to eat a cake, but there is no round." But it's not going to change. It cake, so what to do? Now whatever is is going to be the way it is. So what is there, enjoy it as a cake. But if you go. the use of wasting your brain, your mind, your thoughts in suggesting there, you can never be happy. As something which doesn't work out and simple as that. You have to say that is never going to work out either? So "whatever is there i like". I enjoy think", doesn't work out. "I think it would have been better like this," doesn't work out. Then the second problem is "I like". on thinking like that "like". What is when we start like "I think these trees whatever is there. Then that's the should have been little taller" but they Reality. Whatever doesn't exist, if you are not. So just accept it. like it, so what can anybody do about it. Acceptance is the way we are going to enjoy. But acceptance doesn't mean tolerance because many facets in life that advantage is tolerance means you have to work taken by people because we become very hard to accept that the trees are so vulnerable to our likes and dislikes of the same height. It is too much for that the entrepreneur takes over and It works out in so many ways. In so.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 March- April 2002 32 they create likes and dislikes in our conditioning. They do not belong to head and put ideas everyday. I have any one country. So now those who seen it how they do it. Through have come by plane, had to come television, through newspapers, because from every country there's one plane by which they come. You say, now I like this. But from where this must know one thing that now we have liking has come is the conditioning landed and we are all Sahaja Yogis here and forget your countries - Mix up with other people. Please do not form groups. There is no need at all Well, why? Why don't you like any to form groups. I would request you other flower? By this conditioning, we that in the buses because it starts from the airport we start forming groups and through this and that. So when you which is put into your head. So you are a slave of that conditioning. I only like roses and I don't like any other flower. miss the joy. The second part should be that it continues till the end, till you go enjoy within. Why am I here? It's not back. I think it would be a nice idea to a comfortable place by any chance, so break that and let people sit together, why am I here? To enjoy each other. of different countries and different To enjoy your own being. The more nationalities and talk to each other. Try diversions you have outside, to know about each other. Try to find out about each other, and not just what you know from the newspapers but different problems of Sahaja Yoga. appealing to your ego and your conditioning, the more your mind is busy with that, then you cannot enjoy What are the problems of Sahaja Yoga anything. in a particular country? What happens in a particular country? So we to the other come conditioning which is very subtle, that I am an Englishman or I am American or I am from another city and then reading also. Reading without light is better form a group. The grouping useless and some people still may starts in a sutble way. It is a kind of Worst of all is the conditioning of habit of remembering have insecurity. So we start clubbing. something they have read and a kind Animals do that very often. They have to do it because their sense of of "Show off" as they say. It's better to listen to others. Let others talk. In Sahaja Yoga, on what subject you will discuss, I don't know. How can insecurity is quite a lot and then human beings also do it but not the Saints, not the Angels. They don't form you discuss on anything? Now you see groups because they have no nationality. Nationality is also a this one as a green thing. Now what can you discuss about it? Let's see, it

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 March - April 2002 33 is green but there is - another one who says "No, this is green, but". One may go on like that. There is no need to going off the traok, so what's the use of discussing? You all know that what he is talking is opposite the track so it's all right. You come to the conclusion. Yes, we know, we know. But to discuss it out, there is no need. Once discuss in Sahaja Yoga. I just don't know what are we going to discuss. You know everything. You know how Kundalini rises. You all know how you know and it is in your awareness, the Param Chaitanya will take care of it and you won't have to bother at all, how to correct, how to mend it or what Chakras are cleared out. You know how you get realisation. You all know who catches what and you know that how it effects. Now if that is the fact, if that is the Truth, that is what it is. What to do. That is not your work. You just leave it to Param Chaitanya and it will work out. So here we have come are we going to discuss about it? Discussions are over now. You are because this country has been very gnostics. You are knowledgeable much blessed by so many Saints and people. You have the knowledge but Yogis and you can see it in the people the knowledge that you have is shared how they are and that's why despite all by every one of you. At the most you poverty, despite all kinds of can talk about your experience. You discomforts, and despite the fact that can talk about your relationships, they have not known any Western how you have enjoyed but there is great things, they are not bothered. I nothing to discuss in Sahaja Yoga. I went to Russia, of course Russia was have heard about people who are discussing. I just don't know how can was really surprised how these people there be a discussion about Sahaja have come to Sahaja Yoga and Yoga. great and so many got realisation and I accepted it! The villagers in India may not be Discussion is just trying to show that you know better than the other or Sahaja Yogis, but they respect the you can give another opinion. In Saints. To them a Saint is more Sahaja Yoga, there is no other important than anything else. Nobody opinion. If someone has a Nabhi catch, he has a Nabhi catch. What want to give them, they will not accept. other opinion can you have? So then will ask you for anything. Even if you So that basically I think there is which we finish with different kinds of difference should we arguments and discussions and understand that materialism works things. May be somebody goes off the track may be. But you all know he is And one has to be careful on that much faster in the West than in India.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIV Issue 3 & 4 March April 2002 34 You must remember that you are on point. I am bringing you down to that point now, that are we getting lost into materialism? Of course, you know that grow in your awareness. If you I am a great shopper. I have to go on shopping. And I shop for all of you. But useiess. Once you start thinking like the difference between my shopping is that, you'll be surprised how much you that if I am shopping for all of you, I am will gain and how much you will going there because I know I will get achieve. things much cheaper, and of a better quality. All the good things will be there available, because I am there. I will be Sahaja Yoga. And I don't think we able to get things for all the people have much discipline of any kind either because I love all of them for whom I but it is Sahaja Yoga which somehow have to buy. It always happens like that. When I go out for shopping, even if I have to find things for 400 people, I fire. If you put your hand into the fire, it get the things there all right. That's will burn it whether you like it or not. In why I have to go. When you go then you have to think what we are going to against Sahaja Yoga, you will have to buy. I have seen that Sahaja Yogis will buy things for non-Sahaja Yogis. We have to know that we are one body become unhappy but this time with a and as this hand must look after the much deeper understanding and other hand, when we go out shopping reverence to yourself and to your or do anything, we should always think what we are going to buy for other Sahaja Yogis. a pilgrimage and should be able to cannot grow in your awareness, it is There are no do's and don'ts in or the other disciplines you. I don't have to tell you anything. It's like the the same way, if you do anything pay for it. You definitely don't want to lose your vibrations. You don't want to ascent, you have to take a very joyful serious attitude. May God Bless You
