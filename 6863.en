L: Yes I'd like to, thanks very much. BE: Well here She is.

Shri Mataji: Hello

L: Hello

Shri Mataji: Yes?

L: Is this, would this be a form of yoga?

Shri Mataji: Yes. You see it is Yoga in the sense that it is spiritual yoga, by which you really get the union of your chitta, or what you call the of your attention, with the Divine.

L: Oh, I see.

Shri Mataji: with the spirit. Is not the physical yoga, and the way we practice physical yoga today...

L: Is spiritual yoga is it?

Shri Mataji: Yes, you become one with the Divine.

L: Oh I see.

Shri Mataji: All right?

L: Thanks, and what time is the meeting on Sunday?

Shri Mataji: It's at seven o'clock.

BE: Oh, Sunday morning is at ten o'clock.

L: Ten o'clock?

Shri Mataji: Yes and another one is at seven o'clock tomorrow evening.

L: Do we, would we, would I have to bring anything?

Shri Mataji: Nothing, but I think it would be nice if you were to come tomorrow at seven o'clock.

L: Tomorrow? BE: That's at the Exhibition Building in Nicholson St. L: Yeah, that's the top end of town. BE: Okay? Good. Thanks Les. Goodnight. We'll just.. L: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Goodnight.

BE: take a commercial break here on 3UZ. BE: It's ...to 11 on 3 talkback radio (327)
BE: Good evening Helen? H: Good evening. BE: You want the Mataji? H: Yes please.
BE: Here She is.

Shri Mataji: Hello.

H: Hello.

Shri Mataji: Hello.

H: Hello.

Shri Mataji: Yes?

H: Mataji, I've read in the Bible, in John's gospel, where Jesus said that, "These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you, but the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things." Mataji, I'm wondering if You're that person?

Shri Mataji: I must be. Isn't it? Don't you reach, reach a conclusion at that point?
H: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All right, thank you for this. Thank you very much.

H: Thank you. BE: Our telephone number is 347 3477. BE: Mataji, we're getting a lot of calls from people who want to know how you can cure them. They want to speak to you and say, look I have T.B. or I'm an alcoholic, or I have diabetes; I smoke; I'm a homosexual; they're saying all these things - now can you cure ME? Now I gather you don't want to speak about the method.

Shri Mataji: No, you see it's a simple method as I said, that you have to become your Spirit. That's all it is, and I'll explain to them tomorrow morning how you achieve your Spirit and once you achieve your Spirit you get cured, that's the point.

BE: Of whatever is wrong?

Shri Mataji: You can't say that everyone will be realised, everyone will receive the thing; but most of the diseases get cured, so far I've seen most of the disease got cured. But there's no guarantee about anything.

BE: Right, well now until we're ready to take a few more calls let's go back to the Hare Krishna's because a lot of people in Melbourne witness them in the streets and in their communes. What basically do you find the matter with them?

Shri Mataji: Basically, they're nowhere. You see because by singing the songs like that of Shri Rama they spoil one centre of Shri Krishna. They spoil the centre which belongs to Krishna himself is Vishuddhi Chakra. He resides in that centre. They don't know the centre they are ruining, by all the time saying his name. First of all, you must be connected with him. Krishna has also said Yoga kshema vanmyam - first you get your yoga, unless and until you get yoga there's no use. Because if you are not, say, connected with the telephone, if you use your telephone are you going to achieve anything? We are nowhere if we go on using that telephone. On the contrary, you spoil the telephone. In the same way they are spoiling their telephone which is to be connected with Shri Krishna. So, first they must get their yoga. Even about bhakti, about devotion, Krishna has said these things are like flowers, leaves and water, if you give me I take. But while giving He said, "I want ananyabhakti." Now this is a very diplomatic word, because Krishna knew that people are mediocre, so he played a little diplomacy with them because they, you cannot handle them straightforward. So he said, "Do ananyabhakti," means when there is not the other. Means when you have united yourself with Shri Krishna Himself.

BE: Are the Hare Krishnas a force to be reckoned with in India? Are there many Hare Krishnas in India?

Shri Mataji: You see they are all imported people. People ask me all funny questions about them. They said that now our rich people used to give some sugar to the ants but now because we are producing a lot of ants in Maharashtra, there are lots of sugar in Maharashtra, there are no ants left, so now they have imported these ants from outside. That's all right let the rich look after them, but they are penetrating into the villages.

BE: It's the same as the Hare Krishnas?

Shri Mataji: Yes they are the same.

BE: We have a call from Mary. Good evening. M: Good evening, how are you tonight?
BE: Fine, thank you. You want to speak to the Mataji? M: Yes I heard you just say a few minutes ago that alcoholism can be cured. BE: Well yes Mataji claims that.
M: Well, I don't think it can. I'm a recovering alcoholic and I think you can only arrest it a day at a time. You can't cure it. BE: Did you hear that? M: What did. BE: The lady said that she is a recovering alcoholic.

Shri Mataji: Oh, she can be completely cured.

BE: But she says her program is cure a day at a time.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. It is overnight sometimes.

BE: Did you hear that Mary? M: Yes but I find that very hard to believe.

Shri Mataji: It's really fantastic, I must say. Do come over.

BE: Do you want to go to one of Mataji's meetings? M: I wouldn't be able to get to them to be honest. BE: What about Sunday?

Shri Mataji: Sunday morning.

M: Yes I know where it's at, Yes. BE: You've got the address? M: Ah, I've have the address.
BE: Well I hope..00h I'm sorry here's ma...

Shri Mataji: I'm just saying this is the address of our ashram.

BE: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So they can always come there.

BE: You can go that address any time and be given help. M: Yes, but I still think, you know you can only arrest it a day at a time, sort of. BE: Well perhaps Mataji would like to expand on that. Mary says she believes it can only be helped one day at a time...

Shri Mataji: She has to believe in herself little bit more.

BE: Do you believe in yourself Mary? M: Yes.

Shri Mataji:: Well it's all right.

M: I believe in AA too. BE: In Alcoholics Anonymous. Right well if they're doing good well stick with them. Goodnight. M: OK then. BE: Ah Sue, good evening. S: Hello.
BE: You want the Mataji? S: Yes BE: Can you hear this lady Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

BE: Can you speak up please? S: I was wondering if you can do anything to help handicapped children?

Shri Mataji: They can be helped, they take some time that's all. But you have got this address of My ashram?

BE: She has a centre at 1267 Burke Road Kew.

Shri Mataji: Where you can come and they can help you. It takes little time but they can help you.

BE: Are you there Sue? S: Yes. BE: Can you explain to the caller why it takes a little time?

Shri Mataji: You see, because they are handicapped from childhood and it's a second nature with them, so it takes a little time.

BE: But they can be cured.

Shri Mataji: They can. We have cured so many of them like that. They have to have patience a little bit with them.

BE: Do you have a handicapped child Sue? S: Yes. BE: Yes, well perhaps you should.

Shri Mataji: You should try.

BE: Go to 1267 Burke Road Kew if you're inclined. S: Yes. BE: All right? S: Yes. Ta.
BE: Thanks a lot, Bye bye. BE: Next we have Kosa? Hello BE: Is that how you say your name? K: Kosa. BE: Kosa. You want to talk to the Mataji? K: Yes. BE: Hello, what do you want to say? K: I, I think you're way out. BE: She thinks you're way out.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I am.

BE: She says, She is way out.

Shri Mataji: Thank you for saying that. May God bless you.

BE: Are you still there, Kosa? No, she's gone. BE: Here is Bill. Bill? B: Yes, it's directed to the person who rang in a little while ago. BE: To Mary. B: about alcoholism, she said she found it very hard to believe that an alcoholic could be cured as Mataji said overnight. I am a Sahaja Yogi. I was an alcoholic for eight years. I used to drink at least a bottle of scotch a day for eight years, you know that was minimum, finished it completely, overnight. It just, the desire just left straight away.

Shri Mataji: Well I never knew. Yes it's true he's such a wonderful man. I never knew that he was an alcoholic.

B: And other people too. There's a woman here who was an ex-heroin addict. Again - those things can be cured and can be cured permanently. It's been three years since I've had a drink. There's just no desire for it there at all anymore. It's gone. You get something much greater when you have the connection with the Spirit. BE: Well, that's a wonderful story and thank you for telling us Bill. BE: I think I must say here at this point that the Mataji is here at 3UZ as our guest and Her views do not reflect the views of our station, or us. So if you just bear that in mind. I hope you don't mind me saying this.

Shri Mataji: Oh, no, no.

BE: Sometimes people think we have you here for some other interest in you. We'd just like to make this very clear.

Shri Mataji: Oh, yes, yes it's true.

BE: Oh I must share with you here, everybody who's listening, a picture that has been given to me. I've seen this before. It shows the Mataji sitting on a platform. It's taken in India, and it's a coloured picture and it's a very attractive picture, but the amazing thing about it is that She is sitting in a ray of light. Now, I was shown this picture at the weekend by somebody who is a photographer and they told me that it was sent to one of the photographic firms and they ran it through whatever scanners or whatever they have and there's no explanation for it. Now I'll just say again it's Mataji sitting in a ray of light, perhaps She can explain how it happened. Mataji, what's your explanation for this phenomena, phenomenon?

Shri Mataji: God is miraculous isn't He? How can we explain a transformation of a flower into a fruit? Like that when there is a Divine personality, many things can happen like this which cannot be explained at this level, but they are to be treated just like miracles, I think, for the time being. Later on we'll start understanding them gradually.

BE: And you understand that do you?

Shri Mataji: Yes, I knew all this was happening.

BE: But nobody else did?

Shri Mataji: No, and they just photographed it somehow. It was happening when I put My hand up and it stopped; also when some people photographed My feet there were flames coming out of My feet and hands and everything. There have been so many such photographs.

BE: Well it's extraordinary. We have another call. Ross. Hello Ross. Oh dear Ross is gone.
BE: Hello Kathleen, you said you'd ring back. K: Yes I did. BE: You want to speak to the Mataji? K: Yes I would, very much.

Shri Mataji: Yes what is it Kathleen?

K: Good evening to you.

Shri Mataji: Good evening.

K: I'd like to ask you what qualifications you've got.

Shri Mataji: What qualification I have?

K: Yes.
Shri Mataji: I have none. On the worldly level I have none I think.

K: Well then what can I talk to you about?

Shri Mataji: What kind of a doctor?

BE: No she said, what can she speak to you about...

Shri Mataji: About?

BE: Kathleen wants to know as you say you have no qualifications what she can talk to you about.

Shri Mataji: I am a Mother, that's all.

K: So am I.

Shri Mataji: Good. Then we are on the same point.

K: But what I'm asking about is, you know the qualifications. You know I've got qualifications. You've got qualifications haven't you?

Shri Mataji: Which qualifications you mean?

K: Well, what are you talking about then.

Shri Mataji: I've no qualification, I told you. I don't believe in human qualifications. There is no need to have human qualifications if you have qualifications from God. All right. What qualifications Christ had, can you answer me My question?

K: But wait a minute now what are you preaching to me about?

Shri Mataji: I would like to ask one question of you - what was the qualification of Christ?

K: Well, I'll tell you what the qualifications I've got. The qualifications is the people that I love.

Shri Mataji: The people..?

BE: The people that she loves are her qualifications.

Shri Mataji: Oh that way. Then I have many. You would be one day one of them.

K: In great respect to you: with respect to you, as my, my if I were sitting in your chair I think I'd do a better job than you, love, because I don't preach to God. Everyone belongs to God, we don't have to have someone sitting in a chair with you, love, and you know I don't know what you're talking about. BE: Well, Kathleen, I'll explain it to you at some other stage my dear. K: But now, now Barry... BE: I'm afraid we...K: Now wait a minute Barry. BE: Yes.

Shri Mataji: She's very aggressive. Your qualification - you're an aggressive person, that's what it is I think. You forget it. Forget it.

K: Forget what?

Shri Mataji: Forget this question because you are just in an aggressive mood.

K: No I'm not.

Shri Mataji: Yes you are. You don't want to listen to anything you see. What is your love doing? Is it working out something? I don't talk of love, but My compassion works. Does it work, your love? Does it?

K: I tell you what. I've the greatest love in this world that anyone can have. Don't you worry about that.

Shri Mataji: All right. Then let others say about you that. You don't give yourself a certificate.

BE: Thanks a lot Kathleen. BE: Now we have Ross. Hello Ross? R: Yes, I'd like to talk to this lady. BE: Yes, here she is.

Shri Mataji: Hello.

R: Hello. Look I can't come to any one of your places because I'm a paraplegic and I'm in a wheelchair.

Shri Mataji: You're in a wheelchair?

R: I can't get there.

Shri Mataji: You can't come to my ashram?

R: No, no, I don't go very far at all.

Shri Mataji: All right. In all...

R: I've got a disease called (Badgers?) disease.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now what we can do; you send us a letter with your address and I'll ask some people to come and see you all right?

R: All right, thank you.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

BE: Now Ross do you know where to send the letter to? R: No, I don't really. BE: Have you got a pencil and paper handy? R :Yes. BE: Well you send... R: Just a moment. BE: Yes, while Ross is getting the...R: Yes I've got it. BE: Oh, you're right. You send a letter to 1267 Burke Road Kew and just mention in the letter you rang the forum for some information..
R: Yes. BE: and you were told to drop, write the letter and somebody would come and see you. R: Good. Thank you very much. BE: OK Ross, and thank you for your call. R: Goodnight. BE: Goodnight. We're due to go to a race but they're running late so... Anybody who wants to ring in to speak to the Mataji well you only have a few minutes as She's leaving us at eleven o'clock and we're having a race in the meantime. I'll just repeat that address again for you where Her centre is. It's 1267 Burke Road, Kew, and there's a meeting tomorrow night at seven o'clock at the Exhibition Building and also on Sunday at ten o'clock. Now let's get back to talking to Mataji, and I've got some wonderful pieces of paper here and I'm in a mess as usual because I got to be tidy and when I'm tidy I never know where I am. Now you knew Mahatma Ghandi as a child?

Shri Mataji: Yes I knew him all My life, till he lived, I mean till he died I knew him very well. The last time I met him just one day before his death...

BE: Oh, excuse me, just as it gets interesting we're going over to a race but we'll be back.
(race edited out) The forum continues now with Barry Everingham. Tonight's been one of those nights. First of all we talked about politics and I asked you not to while we had the Mataji here and then the Mataji had to go and we had to turn a lot of people away who wanted to speak to Her. But before, for any of you still listening I've been asked to tell you Her centre at 1267 Burke Road in Kew and there's no charge.
