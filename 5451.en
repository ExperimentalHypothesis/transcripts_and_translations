Short prayer. Bombay (India), 9 February 1975.

You must pray, to God and ask, what you want. 

Ask for “Complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful. Give me love, love that I could… love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.
Give salvation to this… humanity. Which is suffering.
Take me to Your feet. Cleanse me with Thy love."

Now see if there is God or not? You can feel it within yourself. He hears you. He understands you. He’s the glory of all the glory. He loves you. He protects you. He guides you. He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

Any time any thought is coming you pray and you will be moving in the waves of that ocean which is unconscious mind, which starts with thoughtless awareness.

[long pause]

If you cannot become thoughtless, you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I have done and forgive those who have done harm to me.”
