Short Interview on TV, Athens, Greece, 1993-04-27

Sahaja Yoga means: "Saha" means "with"; "ja" means "born with". So it is a right; every human being has got to be in union -that is Yoga- with the Divine Power. And it's within yourself "Sahaj", born with you spontaneous.

Journalist: Explain to us what is Kundalini?
Shri Mataji: Kundalini, as I told you, is the reflection of the Primordial Mother within us. And she is individually everybody' mother. Now, she is anxious to give you your second birth. When she is awakened in the sacrum bone she rises upward and crosses through six centres, pierces through your fontanel bone area and reaches a point where you get connected to the All-pervading Power. It's like, you can say that it's like a cord you have to connect to the mains. So unless and until you are connected to your mains, you do not know what you are.
Once you are connected then you start knowing that you are the Spirit.

In the same way, it rises when it is awakened, very simple. But for that, you have to have somebody who has the authority to raise it, a spiritual authority. Supposing tomorrow, if you get your Realization, you can do it also.

Journalist: What is the relationship between Kundalini and Goddess Athena and Mother Mary?
Shri Mataji: Now "ata", "ata" means, in Sanscrit language, "primordial". So, according to us, Athena was the Primordial Mother and Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother whom we call as Adi Shakti in Sanscrit language. And Mother Mary is one of the forms of Athena, one of the forms of this Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother.

Journalist: How the awakening of Kundalini cures incurable diseases?
Shri Mataji: This is the energy which, of course, in Greece was the- bone was called as sacrum, meaning the sacred bone, and the sacrum bone contains this energy within ourselves, known as Kundalini. That means the Greeks knew about it. And then when she rises, she passes through your subtle centres, there are six above the Kundalini, and whilst she nourishes those centres also connects you to the All-pervading Power with is the vital power.
So first of all, she nourishes those centres that's how you get cured physically, mentally, emotionally,
All our problems come from human beings, and the human beings' problems come from their centres. So if these centres are nourished, they're alright. That is how it works. And then it connects to this All-pervading Power which we call as the Divine Power which does all the living work like these flowers; everything comes from that. So all the time it is flowing within us. So we don't get sick, we don't feel tired, we don't get old.

Journalist: May this philosophy offers solutions to our society's problems and create a better or a new world?
Shri Mataji: Yes of course, because what's wrong with us- I just now told you- is all these problems coming from human beings because they are ignorant and they are blind. But once they get the light, they become like angels. And when all these angles will come back, then, there will be no problem.
All our society is ruined because we have no idea of the aim of our life. The aim of our life is to become the Spirit, to have the Self-knowledge. And once you have Self-knowledge, you are surprised to see how dignified you are and how glorious you are within yourself.
Once you discover that, all these things drop out and you become a wonderful person.

Shri Mataji: And also about others. Because also you develop a new awareness, a new dimension which we call as Collective Consciousness by which you can feel the centres of others. Now, if you know how to cure these centres, you can cure others also.
Journalist: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
