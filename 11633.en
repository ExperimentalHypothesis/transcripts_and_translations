Warm Tributes to Sir C.P. on his 3rd election as the Secretary General of IMCO (from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 3 , Pages 15--17)

Dear Members of the Universal Sahajyoga family,

I am very greatly honored and very over­whelmingly touched by the most generous observations which have been made about me and about my work......whatever I can do to deserve the love and affection that you have chosen to shower upon me. You have

mentioned that I have been sacrificing in order that my wife who is Mataji to you would be able to devote her time for Sahaj­ yoga. What I want to inform you is; it is not a sacrifice, it’s a great privilege. When we got married, and that was more than a third of a century ago (34 years ago) we had our family, a little family, and we agreed among ourselves that our first duty would be to bring up our two daughters. We also agreed that once the daughters got married, SHE would be free to devote her time as much as possible to the service of humanity. While our children were growing up—SHE gave all her time and devotion to them to bring them up and SHE gave me tremendous support. Without HER support, it would

have been impossible for me to apply myself for the responsibility which the Govt, of the country entrusted to me. I am deeply grate­ful to HER. But today what I want to state is that I am not grateful to HER but I am very proud of HER. And why am I proud of HER ? I am proud because, at a time when the world is afflicted everywhere, whether you are in the East or in the West, whether you are in the North or in the South, every­ where you find a certain feeling of unrest, of unhappiness or a little frustration and people all over the world are wanting to know, "how can we all members of this universal world community live together in happiness and in

peace.” This is the question before every thinking individual in the world today. And there must be some answer to that, because after all we have to live together, and an­swer really is that all of us whether we be­ long to one country or another, we are mem­bers of one great universal family. After all, if we just remember, that the whole of uni­ verse that we know of there is only one planet on which there is life, such as we have and that, we are the most fortunate persons to be those created by the Almighty to be the best of creations, that itself is a very great privilege and the least that we should somehow do is to live together as brothers and sisters genuinely, not merely thro’ lips but thro’ hearts and it is most important for us. lo come to that stage. I have a feeling that the world is now ready for a new revolution. There was the industrial revolution in the 19th century which brought economic prosperity to many parts of the world, thus bringing prosperity to other parts. But that is not enough. For hu­man beings material prosperity is important, but it is not the ultimate aim. There is much more in a human being than a mere desire for material well being—the spiritual part. It is only through spiritual attainment, through spiritual satisfaction that genuine happiness can be attained, and there must be some SPARK which has to light and the source of the SPARK is before you. THIS LADY. So when I say I am not sacrificing at all, in­ deed I am feeling to be a part of you, feeling to be a part of this great endeavour, and I am proud of HER and the work SHE is doing.

I might tell you something more. Very recently I had a unique experience. SHE is a very busy person and if I may say so with­ out being immodest, I am also very busy with my work, but one evening SHE invited me very kindly to a function like this in London. There I saw another family a Sahajyoga family, Sahajyogis and Yoginis. What a wonderful expression they had, what a feeling of internal peace and calm they had, what feelings of togetherness they had. That gave me a very deep impression, a feeling that, that family had been transformed from desperate individuals coming from different parts of the country into a family mended together, knitted together with one purpose, viz., realising that we are members of one family. They all wanted to assist each other to help each other to grow together and to develop spiritually. Now, this is a marvell­ous task. I think the world needs this more than anything else. This country needs this much more than anything else. It is the transformation, it is the uplifting of the indi­vidual from within, which is most important. If that uplifting does not come, you will have conflicts, you will not have the kind of homogeniety or goodwill, which is so essential for all of us to be able to live together in peace. So, SHE is giving you spiritual guidance and I have no doubt that I am one of those thousands and thousands who admire HER, respect HER, and my fullest support is available to HER in every way for the work that SHE is doing. But, I think, support is not the right word because SHE does not need support from anybody; but you see you must forgive me because I have a dichotomy. It is very difficult for me to forget that I am HER husband, so please do forgive the expression that I have used but, it was in my capacity as a consort and I want you to know that the work she is doing is to my way of thinking very very important for humanity. In fact, I feel that if is only by uplifting men & women everywhere throughout the world, that we can really become worthy of the Almighty God who has created us all. Now, in IMCO, the Organisation that I am privileged to serve, I am very grateful for the kind words about my re-election. It was most gratifying. Perhaps you know that this was unanimous. I mention this only for one reason, viz that you would hear that there are many issues that divide the world. On very few issues the Govts, of the World agree. Now, if they agreed upon re-election, whether it was Soviet Union, United States, United Kingdom, or Developing Countries or China or Pakistan, well, they agreed to uphold a certain principle and in some way perhaps the message of Sahaja Yoga was being given to them through me coming from HER. And the message that I always give to the member countries of the Organisation is: “ We are not divided into groups. I do not believe in groupism. I do not believe in confrontation, I do not believe that by fighting, the world can get along. I do not believe that the developing world can develop by fighting the developed world. I believe, and I believe very sincerely & genuinely, that all of us can get together only by way of togetherness, by co-operation and this is the message that I give continuously.’1 Now this is only one aspect of Sahaj Yoga, only an aspect, but this is the message that I give to the organisation that I am privileged to serve and I am most gratified & delighted that the governments as they are represented in this Maritime Organisation of the United Nations System, accept that philosophy and they accept that by working together the people of the world engaged in Maritime activity can make progress, which would be satisfactory from the point of view of everybody and if they re-elected me unanimously, honour me greatly and my country but to my way of thinking they honoured the principle which is to guide the whole of United Nations system. So, in some way there has been action and interaction between Sahaja Yoga on one side and United Nations activity on the other. I have only a small responsibility in the United Nations system but to the extent that I can, it is my duty and it has been my endeavour always to serve the World Community in a far more elevated sphere— the spiritual sphere. Now to friends who have come from abroad, as an Indian I would like to extend a very hearty and a very warm welcome. I feel very greatly honoured & privileged that you should be here at this time that you should spend your new Year Day in our country and I want to take this opportunity to wish you the very very best for 1981 and the best that I can do is to say let Sahaja Yoga which is universal, grow and grow & develop and really lift up the word to a new level of awareness, new level of human relationship based on love, affection, & realisation that human beings are born for great purposes, they are not born merely to live a routine life but the purposes are spiritual-much highly elevated. For your success, for your happiness and your well being I will pray and with these few words I want to thank you once again for the very very kind words in which all speakers referred me today and I may also thank HER for all that SHE is doing for me by supporting me really. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (Laughter & claps)
