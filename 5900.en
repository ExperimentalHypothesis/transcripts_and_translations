Realisation is not of the Intellect”, Public Programme. Caxton Hall, London, England. 3 December 1979.

Nice talk he gave and also I thank all of you for coming down here.

In his frantic effort of explaining to you that you have to get something here, is the expression of his own experiences about himself. He had problems of the same style as you had and he knows, that if you go on analysing things with your brain and with your intellect then you are going to delay, and because he knows what mistakes one may commit, and he has also seen so many doing that, that’s why he’s trying to tell you that at least if we have committed mistakes you be cautioned and you learn from our mistakes and try to come up fast and listen to it and take it. Now the seekers are there, as you know but, as he says they have labelled themselves as seekers. “We are seekers”. And they are so proud of seeking, that he himself has told me, that now they do not want to give up seeking even if they find it. It’s a very funny situation and I said, “Why is it so?” That he says “No, you form a sort of a habit. Then you don’t want to give up the habit because you’ll go into sort-of a funny situation if you give up the habit and that’s why they just want to continue with it even if they have found it. I mean all kinds of complicated situations we have faced so far.

But a simple thing is this – very simple thing – is to understand that there is... something beyond... which we are seeking. The beyond is the self within us is the spirit. The spirit that resides in our heart. And this spirit has to come into our conscious understanding. We know there is someone who is watching us who knows all about it. But, He is not in our conscious mind, means we cannot see through Him. He sees us, we look at Him as something hidden behind the curtains. But now how to remove that curtain and to become one with that? By becoming one with that, what happens is, that you get connected to the mains. And to the whole. Of which you are part and parcel. The whole universe, the whole creation is a part and parcel of one organic being. Through our ignorance we start thinking that we are separated from it. Till we are animal stage, we are going according to the will of the nature and we do not have the freedom, so in a way we are one with that divine force... but we are not aware of it. Only in the human stage, it is said that you will become aware of it. Is said in all the scriptures, like Koran like Bible like Vedas like Gita – which is a part of Veda you can say. Also great sages all over the world right from Moses, Abraham, Socrates, Lao Tse. In India: Janaka, Nanaka, Vasishta. Later on, people like, we can say in the history, about 6th century, we had a very great saint or a great personality or an incarnation like Shankaracharya. All these people have been... talking about your second birth. That you are to be born again, unless and until you are born again you are not a Christian, you are not a Hindu you are not a Muslim. Keep it one name. There are ten names to one thing for ‘Twice Born’. So it boils down to one simple point that you are to be born again. You are born again and again now. From Amoeba to this stage you are born again and again. There must be something continuous otherwise how do you improve onto it? So you reach a stage which is called as human being and now here it is said that you are to be born again. Only in this stage – when you’re born again – it is in your own consciousness. All other stages you never felt how you are born again and again. And this feeling that you are seeking that you have to seek something comes to you from the unconscious because you are to be born again. And unless and until that happens to you, you are not going to feel happy. Like anything that is made, any instrument that is made if it is not put to the mains it doesn’t work – it has no meaning. And when you find life meaningless you turn to seeking.

But the one who has created you, so far, has made you a human being from amoeba, has made arrangements for it. What are the arrangements he had made within us for our germination for our second birth is shown in this figure. I am today talking to people because there lots of people who are new, and they should be able to follow it up that we have all these arrangements within ourselves. Now this is not so complicated as we make it. If you think by reading about it you are going to have it, we have had many readers, so far. I mean we have books and books and books. We never read to breathe we never read to have a human existence. We just have it. In the same way if you have to have your Realisation you are not going to read about it. It has to be something spontaneous, Sahaja, is born with you: “Saha-ja”. “Saha” means “with” and “Ja” is “born.” It is with you, within you. It is said everywhere. Everybody has said “It is within you.” Now where is it? The spirit is in the heart. But where is the germinating power?

I am sorry for this but this is what it is. Poor Coolie [or Kuli? – a Yogi’s nickname] has vanished in thin air. [Shri Mataji laughs] He’s feeling very b.... Coolie has kept outside. Sorry but today is the first day we have such a small room, you know. [Shri Mataji laughs again] I’m sorry for this we have... Sit down sit. I think leave the door open otherwise it’ll bang at you, you can sit here. Marcus you can come done here in front. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi?] ise ki yes that mein. Nahi nahi mere ke kene. Tuhi koi ayega to khol lega, khule honee kije ke rakhiye, bas. Ha, just now. They’ll come, they know. They’ll all come. They’ll find out after all. Jab koi ayega then you should be able to move out. This is what I am saying. Actually in Sahaja Yoga we have very tall people with long legs [Shri Mataji laughs] and they find it difficult to fold them up you see.

Now as we have got this being... without any difficulties, it’s nothing serious about it: it’s just there. Is the play of God’s desire. You have got it. In the same way our Realisation is also going to work out, with that living force which has brought forth this human being. Now that living force has also within us, through our evolution, has created all this. These are all different centres which are subtle centres, which are the, we can say the undercurrents of our being. These centres you cannot see with your naked eyes, because they are placed either in the spinal cord or in the brain. But they do give rise to gross centres outside. Now these centres are beautifully placed. The first one with the four petals is called as ‘Mooladhara chakra’. Now this centre is placed below the Kundalini. Now mark, this is a very important point. It is placed below the Kundalini. This represent the material side or we can say the matter that is within us, is the earth element within us, is the ‘Jada’ as they call it, is the, “dead” is a bad word, but I would say, “the thing that is not yet been awakened.” The mother element of earth is there, higher, but this is the child element – that is the innocence – is placed. The embodiment of innocence is placed under the Kundalini that is, called as the Mooladhara chakra, and which controls also our sex. It gives rise to pelvic plexus which also has got four sub-plexuses. Now it is interesting to note that it is placed under the Kundalini so if the Kundalini has to rise She doesn’t go through this. So sex has nothing to do with Kundalini rising. Only thing is, that when the message from your hands when you are placing your hands towards me, the message – please sit with your hands like this – the message that there is somebody who can raise the Kundalini or the message to the Kundalini or invitation to the Kundalini, goes through your fingers, down, here, passes through these two lines that you see, and inform that... deity which is sitting down there, who is Shri Ganesha. Who when awakens and informs the Kundalini which is the Mother of Ganesha, Gauri, sitting in the triangular bone, which is they call as a three-and-a-half coiled serpent, because it has got itself in a shape of a serpent. It is three and a half coil. It has also got a very great mathematical significance, three-and-a-half. Now this power, is the germinating power. Now it is called as the residual power. Means after creating the whole “binda,” the whole zygote of a human being still it remains the full. This is the power that we call, is the Mahakali power because, it is the power of desire of God. He desires that you should get your Realisation. The desire of God is expressed within us through this left side power which you see left side channel, is called as the Mahakali power. As long as He desires we exist, as soon as He doesn’t want we do not exist. So the left side gives rise to our desires and also looks after our emotional side. Means it is not yet materialised.

The second power you see on the right hand side, yellow one, is the power to create. This is called as Mahasaraswati power. In the Sanskrit language these are expressed much clearly, we can call it the creative power. The creative power of God descends within us through this and is effective in giving us creative powers, of thinking power, of mental effort, and physical effort. So we put in our mental and physical efforts through this power, which is called as Mahasaraswati power. In the centre is the power which is called as the evolutionary power which as you can see has gaps. And this is the power of Mahalakshmi power, which is not yet fully connected. This is the gap. So we have three powers, in the same way in the gross we have three autonomous nervous systems. The one on the left is called as the left sympathetic, one on the right as the right sympathetic and the centre is called as the parasympathetic. Now, left sympathetic acts for our emotions, the right acts for our physical and mental efforts, and the central acts for our co-ordination, for our balancing and for supply of this power vital power.

But as these two side powers, left and right start working, as a by-product of these two powers we develop very big two balloons in our head, which can be called as Ego and Superego. One is yellow coloured and other is blue coloured and they cross over. Because of this the head gets covered, and we get separated. The fontanel bone here gets calcified and you become “Mr. X” and another becomes “Mr. Y” and another becomes “Mr. Zed”. Now you are separated from that all pervading power, because now you have to know it in your consciousness. Then you start seeking. It is something like this we can understand that evolution could not go any further. Like a little chick, bird, which does not know how to fly. So the mother hides herself somewhere and starts calling. Ultimately the chick bird gets the confidence and flies towards the mother. Because you have to know what this power is, you have to know how to manoeuvre this and you have to know how to enjoy this power of God, which He wants to bestow upon you. By this power the whole universe is ruled; is the power of divine love. It exists. It is everywhere and after Realisation you are surprised that you become, again I say you become, you are actualised. It is no lecturing that you have to be this or you have to be that. Is actually happens within you that you be collectively conscious. Means you can start feeling others on your fingers as shown there. And you get self-realisation by which you see within yourself what you are. You start seeing your chakras within yourself, one by one and you can correct it and you can correct the chakras of others also.

Now I agree it’s a very difficult task... as they say. But to some, maybe experts are there, some masters could be there. For example once upon a time, even... say... to come to London from India was of course an impossibility. Even to go from Bombay to Banaras, people would sell out their houses, everything and everybody would cry as if they are going to die on the way. It was that impossible. It was so very slow. But as the time has moved you have got now aero planes and you are going to the moon. In the same way, the Kundalini shastra has improved so much, that today we have among ourselves, thousands of Sahaj Yogis in India, who just get their Realisation in thousands, in thousands. In the cities of course there is problem because people are very complicated.

In the west they get their Realisation very fast, no doubt, because they are real seekers, no doubt. But they lose it equally fast. The reason is once they get their Realisation as usual they must have read some books of analysis of some psychologist, – “Mr. Boen” I have heard recently a name – they go home and start analysing. Once you start analysing it’s finished. You cannot analyse it. I am talking of synthesis. And if you start analysing it, the living thing is finished. Supposing you have to analyse this finger, just think like that, you cut it from here first of all, then you open it out one by one and see for yourself what is inside this. Here I am talking of synthesis. Moreover one should know: by thinking you have not got it, by analysing you have not got it, you have just got it spontaneously. So why should you analyse it? You should employ the methods which are synthesising you – are putting your whole being in one line or you can say in one thread. That all your diversified temperaments and beings are just fixed together. That you become one with the whole, that you become completely relaxed. As I gave one example – which many people like it very much – that some people where told not to take too much luggage on their heads and they went to the... they...in an aero plane they went, and they said that you shouldn’t take too much luggage on the aero plane. They put back their luggage on their heads thinking that aero plane may be feeling more weight for that, so they were trying to reduce the weight of the aero plane. In the same way we are trying to reduce the weight of the aero plane.

The one who has created us, the one who has made us human being is going to make us that great. But Mr. Ego says “No how can it be, I must do it myself”. You cannot. You cannot even transform one flower into a fruit. We must accept: we have done nothing living, what we have done is all dead. Like creating this building now, is all dead. From dead to dead, just changing forms. So if the smallest living thing God has to do then this thing He has to do. For Him it is better that He does it, otherwise He will lose His own significance and meaning to His creation.

But what we have done in our freedom, is like, you were asked to sit in a... say a small little boat, and we were about to cross, while everybody started jumping in the sea. For nothing at all, you started going on to the left side or to the right side. If it came to crying, weeping and troubling yourself, destroying, self-destroying, you did everything that was possible under the sun. Then when it came to destroying others you did everything that was possible under the sun. So either to the right or to the left we have been going bit too much, and that is why we have to correct that point. That correction also one can do with Kundalini awakening. Everything is possible; it has to happen, it has happened to thousands and should happen. You can see with your naked eyes the movement of the Kundalini. But in some places it is so fast that you just start feeling cool breeze flowing for your hand. It is said in the Bible that from the Holy Ghost you get cool breeze. It is said of course, I mean in the Indian scriptures you know that they are full of it. There’s a very beautiful shloka of Shri Shankaracharya, he says “Saleelam, Saleelam” a cool breeze, start flowing. He calls it as “Chaitanya Lahari,” he calls it as “Saundarya Lahari,” he calls it as “Ananda Lahari.” But many things happen when the Kundalini rises. It is not just... happens that Kundalini straight off comes into... What you call the “Pranalay”, “Manalay” all these things takes place, all the Raja Yoga takes place within yourself, the “Bandas” takes place and then the Kundalini comes up. But it comes so fast that you do not feel any one of them. This is why this is Maha Yoga stage of Sahaj Yoga. Maha Yoga stage because, at this stage you meet: till you have not met me, you have not met me. Maybe you might have come up to Victoria, even up to this place and if you have not met me you have not met me. So if you have to meet me, then that moment when you meet me is the real point. If you have not met me, till that moment it has no meaning... In the same way all yogas are useless, if there is no Maha Yoga.

So, the time of Maha Yoga has come, and you have to get it, and it has to work out. It is as simple as that. That’s why Gregoire is very frantic because he knows that you should take it because he has been to many gurus. Most of them have been to gurus and all sort of things they have been to. And they have suffered a lot; they have gone through hell with this have really suffered a lot. They know that what they have gone through by going to gurus. And that’s why they are frantic, that “please now give up all that.” For this you cannot pay, because this is love of God and you cannot pay for love of God. You cannot pay for love of God.

Is no question. Because it is insulting on the contrary, I think, that we think of paying. And anybody who talks of these things is a nonsensical fellow. Is absolutely nonsensical.

So first of all you get your Realisation. Then one problem arises which I must tell you, which I have seen happening – apart from analysis and all that. The one problem that arises is, that you start facing yourself. First of all some of you, who have harmed yourself. Like the other day we had a gentleman who has been to a spiritualist. Now they look very harmless you see spiritualist people. But they very harmful people. Poor fellow, he had all kinds of diseases and everything when he came to me. And he has been to the spiritualist church. Now spiritualists are nothing but absolutely, what you can call them, they are the people who put possessions into you. So he was completely possessed. Apart from diseases he could not sleep and he was getting hallucination, an’ jumping out of his bed, and was feeling that his body’s leaving him and he’s going anywhere else, all kinds of complications he had. So, when he got his Realisation, he started feeling pins and needles first of all, when he put his hands towards me. In the hand pins and needles and things like that. He got a fright. I said “Why? Face it.” Because that is the problem: in the light you start seeing everything. If there is no light everything is black. Well and good. No problem. If this sari is not clean you cannot see if there are any spots. But as soon as you clean this all the permanent spots you can see clearly. In the same way you start seeing them. Once you see them there is nothing to be frightened. Because you must know that now you are separated from yourself, which was dirtied which was spoiled which was aggressed. That personality is separated from you, believe me. And then it is very easy to cleanse that. You have to be little bit, patient with yourself. Of course I am very patient no doubt. But you have to be patient. Sometimes it happens that if the problem is there, you start facing it in the way that you may see that now this finger is catching, this finger is catching, “I’m getting... heat from these two fingers Mother, now what does that mean? I’m not getting cool all over?” That means something; these two fingers denote two chakras. And if there is a problem in these centres, you can be cured. You can be alright.

So this Kundalini not only connects you with the absolute, but gives you all absolute spiritual values. After that if you want to ask questions say, “Is there God,” immediately cool breeze will start flowing. The rapport is established. You are one with the absolute. Unless and until you have absolute, you cannot decide about anything; whatever you decide is nothing but relative. And all relative values are confusing. You do not know whether it is right or wrong. For example now if I give you a ring like that, you will say “Alright, it is ring, this thing this thing. It is so much price this.” That’s all, finished. Somebody will say “it is nice,” somebody’ll say “I don’t like it,” Somebody’ll say “is yes it’s good, but this...” Depending on if you are French, if you are Indian or English. But, if you are a realised soul, you will immediately know it is Mataji’s ring, all of you. How? Even if it is kept here and they’ll know Mataji’s ring is over here. How? Because there will be vibrations oozing out. And you will know that these vibrations cannot be from anybody else but Mataji’s ring.

You’ll be amazed, we went to Kashmir and we were going in a car, and suddenly in a jungle I felt tremendous vibrations. And I told my husband “There must be some sort of a big temple here or must be some living deity that has come out of the earth, must be something.” So I asked the driver “Is there any temple?” He said, “No temple here, there’s no Temple.” I said, “No it’s not possible there must be something.” So I said, “Alright you follow this way,” and we went nearer and nearer and it became hotter and hotter, in the sense cooler and cooler, because you start feeling cooling with the... with the vibrations. And amazement came to me. The driver said, “Yes, that is true, there is a big place here called as ‘Hazrat-bal,’ and one hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept here.” And when we went in, they were very kind to me, suddenly I don’t know what happened to them, they didn’t ask me I was Hindu, Muslim or anything, just took us inside and everything. And I was just in full enjoyment of that place, with one hair of Mohammad Sahib. So the whole value is decided and judged on vibrations, so you get a new awareness which is called as vibratory awareness. So your awareness itself is enlightened. Means, the word that is used in Sanskrit for enlightenment is, “Pra”. You are “Prabudh”. Your awareness becomes enlightened. That you start seeing the things or feeling the things which are absolute, and knowing which are not, so your whole priorities change. And you become a dynamic personality – absolutely dynamic. Because your powers start flowing, and you get such a big, canvas or you can say spectrum to work with. As Gregoire has told you that I’m a very good cook yes, I’m a very good housewife and I’m good at thousand and one thing. And also I run a big organisation of Sahaja Yoga and all those things I do.

[cassette side 2: Cassette label indicates side 2 as “afternoon session.”]

Come along. I wish, Djamel you had brought one of your aero planes here. [Shri Mataji laughs.] Come along. Is there somebody else coming in? Please come in. Come, come here Djamel. He’s coming from Algeria. Hello. Come along, come along, come along. Hello... come along, sit down. I’m sorry! You see this is the mess in which we are today, thanks to Caxton hall. Ha aap log agar samne bhatjai, tho acha ho ga baisab. Aap jar hai? Acha ho aye ham pyas peeka aajao. Haa. lekin bahut soch ke puchega. Waje ye hai ki, koi... prashna aisa hona chahiye, ki, ha kyonki usse agar dimag logo ka uchal jaye, chiita gar unka, uchal jaye tho cheek nahi kyonki bas soch vich, nazuk kaam hai. Aap samaj hai? Ha. Kyonki is me puchne ka kuch hai nahi banne ki baat. Ugar ban jaye, tho ban jaye. Aur nahi bane to nahi bane. Aisa hai iska haal. Waise tho aapke sare savalon ko mein javab de doon gi. Par is vaje sime ker hi hoon kin ka chitta ek dam se doosre jagah le jayega. Banake cheez le jaa rahe hai. Teek?

Now he wanted to ask some questions so I have requested him that just now don’t ask me questions because just now I am putting your attention to something, your attention may be diverted. And... I don’t mind any number of questions: you know that I have answered thousand and one, and I don’t mind answering, but that’s not going to give us the Realisation. What is it we want Realisation, first of all let us work it out and then we’ll talk about it. Because in darkness what is the question. In light then we’ll talk. In light you can see better – then we’ll talk about it. First let us have the light.

So now we come to the end of our lecture for today. I have given an introduction. The questions that are going into your minds I know. One of them is that, those who have come now is that they have heard horrible things about Kundalini. I have to tell you... that those people who have no right, no authority to raise Kundalini, if they raise the Kundalini there is a problem. They have to be absolutely holy pure people. “Veetaraga” as it is called. Sahaj Yogis is different. They have a special authority. But normally they have to be very highly evolved people to raise the Kundalini. If they try any tricks... the Ganesha who is sitting there in the first chakra gets annoyed and they have complications. So, if supposing a person like me who is naive who doesn’t understand what is this instrument is, and tries to do something about it – it will only break it. In the same way, people break that Kundalini, they break that instrument, and we have had a very bad time correcting it. But why ask such a question also, that supposing it is easy why not have it? I mean that should be normal reaction. Why should we say that it is said that it is very difficult, alright, may be but we are going to do it fast so why not. Lets have it! That should be normal attitude isn’t it? But human beings are very funny that way, isn’t it? Because supposing I say “There’s a diamond here free for you, come along... have it.” They’ll come all the way from Australia! Then why not for this?

So, I would request you to get your Realisation first. If you think too much about it or if you analyse it, it will not work out. My idea is that you should get it. And that’s why I’m telling you, to take it easy. Do not, sort-of... take it in a frantic way. Just leave it alone, it will work out. It’s just like germinating a seed. It’s like just enlightening a lamp. One candle which is enlightened can enlighten another candle, but supposing the other candle is all the time falling this way that way or if the attention of the other candle is not alright, then how do you enlighten it? So keep the attention in the centre, it will work out. The most important thing that you should get it otherwise what is it? What... life has no meaning. This is what you are here for, so you should get it. If you don’t get it, then we’ll find out the question or the problem. Alright? Now don’t put your mind into a questioning style, but just let it go. Let it go, let it work out. Now here there are at least 60% people who are realised souls – among you, sitting. Or I would say 70%. And those who know all about Kundalini, raising of the Kundalini – everything they know. They have seen Kundalini rising. Now you have to be one of them.

Today’s a very international gathering here. We have people from France, we have people from Switzerland, we have people from Algeria, we have people from America and... all over the people have come today somehow it’s a very great day. And it should work out, with all these great saints coming here it should work out. So just expose yourself and it would work out. You must know one thing that I cannot take anything from you. I cannot receive; my nature is not to receive but just to give. So you take it from me, it’s a gift. Just take it, and have it, and enjoy it! This is what you have been seeking, not in this life but many lives before and the time have come and chance has come, so better have it. Do not miss this. That’s what I have to request you.

So please put your hands like... Bhai sahib, aise baiti hoon. Just like that. Just like they are. Very beautiful people have come today. I don’t know where were they before. I just missed them. Just simple hands like this. You can close your eyes if you can, some people can’t close they get a flickering of the eyes. If you do not get any flicker please keep your eyes closed. If you are getting flickering of the eyes then please open them. Something is wrong with the centre here... if you cannot keep your eyes closed. You can’t close your eyes? Are you getting flickering? Can you close? Put your forehead little open for me to see – forehead. Just like this. You will start feeling cool breeze in your hand. To begin with, if you watch your thoughts there is no thought you will find you are thoughtless. This is the Nirvichar Samadhi is established. “Samadhi” means “awareness that is enlightened” and “Nirvichar” means “thoughtless.” This is the first one that comes to you. Second one, which comes to you is Nirvikalpa, which means “doubtless.” You know how it works, how you manoeuvre it. How you go about it. You practice it.

Come along.

Yogi: Should some of us go out, Mother?

Shri Mataji: ye?

Yogi: Should some of us go out...?

Another yogi: Some of us can stay and some of us can go outside, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Just now we have space. When the space becomes that impossible you can go.

Yogi: Shall we stay?

Shri Mataji: If you have love we can do with much less space, you see... and if you don’t have love, even big mansions are not sufficient for one man.

Just put your hands like this, just like this, simple, absolutely simple.

Hot.

Now we have to forgive others. That is very important in Sahaja Yoga. We have to forgive others. First of all let us forgive others. Then we have to forgive ourselves also because we find lots of faults with ourselves. That’s a modern fashion. Know that you are that beautiful thing which is the source of truth, joy and awareness. And now you have to also ask for forgiveness if you have done any mistakes by doing something extremes or disobeying, the laws of nature... Anything like that if you have done, you have to ask for forgiveness. Ask for forgiveness, will help very much. God is so generous, so compassionate, so kind, that He forgives us for all that we have done against Him. All that we have done neglecting Him, ignoring Him, His importance.

Forget the past and don’t worry about the future, because the past is over and the future doesn’t exist. You have to jump in between the two, which will happen to you it just will happen. That you’ll become thoughtless to begin with, there would be no thought in your mind, to begin with. And then we’ll start feeling the cool breeze coming from your hand.

Today in a session, in the morning time, at least 90% people felt the cool breeze. 90% people, felt it. But do not condemn yourself if you are not feeling, may be something wrong physically, mentally, something wrong somewhere, which we have to correct. Left. Please forgive. Will you all say Lord’s Prayer, I think that will improve a lot. Will you please open the door a little of this window please. Ha

(Yogis say Lord’s Prayer)

Shri Mataji: Again. Thrice.

(Yogis repeat Lord’s Prayer)
