1973-1207 Origin of Sahaj Yoga, Public Program, Birla Sports Center (translation from Hindi)

Love does not have any language, so there are no words to describe love. When our mother loves us, how can she describe her love. Similarly, when God Almighty loves us and created this universe, He had no words to describe His love. When a human being has prepared their instrument, that’s when they can begin to praise God.
I have not been given a particular subject for discussion today by the organizers of the program as we have three days to fully understand everything. Today I will talk about evolution. What I say will be hypothetical. All Science experiment begin with a hypothesis. Hypothesis means whatever is the discovery of science, that assumption should be presented to the audiences. And the truth within that hypothesis is researched. The day that hypothesis is proven, that’s when it is considered a law of science. Similarly, what I say is hypothesis to you that can be proven and shown to you all. Also all that has been documented and observed in the historic documents that can prove this hypothesis. But the proof should not be in accepting what is being said in documents or by certain someone. It should be experienced.
Today I will talk about evolution. It is the day of ‘Pratham’ and we will state the relationship of this day with Sahaj. It is said about Bramha that it is beyond evolution. What we consider awareness, Bramha is separate from that. Vibrations are a form of Bramha. Whatever there is, is a form of Bramha. Just like a seed manifests itself into a tree and all parts of a tree, and then that tree ends up being a seed again. Similarly, Bramha manifests itself in a number of forms and then again transforms into a seed and unlimited number of Universes evolve with that seed. Just like a plant seed, you can consider seed of Bramha too, we can call it Seed of Bramha (Bramha beej). Every seed has a certain power of evolution. Every seed is comparable. Similarly, the power of evolution of Brahma is known as Bramha and power of Bramha.
Why did God Almighty have to create this universe when He is complete in Himself? How much ever a human being may be rich or accomplished, he is not satisfied until he produces an offspring. They think who is all this wealth for? There are a number of very rich people in the world but are childless. They try very hard to have at least one child to whom they can pass on their gathered wealth and reveal it to their child. In the same manner, when feeling of love took birth within God Almighty, the powers flowing in Him gathered and got founded as Bramha or Adi Shakti. So, what remains in the middle out of this process, is God. These scientists tell me that they do not believe in God. You may not believe in God, but you trust your heart. What is it that resides in your hearts? What resides in your heart is God. The one who is God Almighty is a reflection of spirit and resides in our heart and is our continuous witness. He is a witness to every deed of ours and is watching everything. He is the soul, also described by words such as spirit, spiritual, and as human spirit when he takes birth. The one who resides as a witness in our heart is God Almighty, His power, in the beginning as Agnya power, is equipped to begin the creation of the universe. At that time, three forms of transformation come in that power or it transforms itself into three forms. First, it gets the desire that I should have an offspring, a creation. Due to this desire, she embeds ‘ tamoguna’ within Herself. I have described this to you before as to how it takes place and what direction does it goes into. There is no blackboard available right now to explain this flow in a diagram to you at the moment. This desire is critical to the set up of Valay of Tamoguna.
All of Valay moves with the bindu matra power of Agnya. You will be surprised to know that a bindu when revolves to its original position, its Valay is parabolic. Eisntein says every moment is parabolic. You must have noticed in Temples of Shiva, that the power of shiva is parabolic in shape. Per Einstien anything that moves, it moves in parabolic direction. Similarly, one cay say that love also moves in parabolic direction. And Valay also moves in parabolic direction i.e. where it starts from, it returns to the same position. That’s what parabolic movement is. In that sense, we can say that first Valay shape created Tamoguna in the universe. Like a fan has 3 blades. Same way if you can imagine, first parabolic movement was started. Second, when you desire something then an event has to take place for that. Some work had to be done. Without some work it could not happen. Thus some activating forces took birth that founded Rajoguna. Due to second parabolic movement, Rajoguna were founded. Along with that the event that took place, was that of desire that all love should be showered over the creation. Showering love on your creation, offspring, is revalation and this is what creates Satvaguna. So you can see that one thing only creates these three Gunas. Such permutations and combinations is what creates this universe and within that earth gets created. Creation of earth also took place out of parabolic movement. Now if you study under Sciences, then theory of explosion is well founded in people’s mind. A decade ago, I also used to say that an explosion had taken place. Without explosion, this evolution of ours could not have taken place. This state of evolution has been brought by multiple explosions. But people now have started saying that a certain mass exploded in an unexpected manner and resulted in different systems like Solar system etc. Today Science is saying the same thing. Upon creation of earth, another explosion took place that brought life on earth. As you know, the very first living beings were small one celled. After that, slowly we reached the state of being a human being. We don’t have to go into details of evolution. But if you think more deep into that topic, one well known Biologist named Udua has written that if human being was formed out of root, then how is it possible that it took such a short time for living beings to take human form. This was not by chance. This type of creation does not take place just like that. There was a force behind it, someone was doing this work. Someone was giving pace to this evolution and taking care of it and was leading it. Without which leave alone human being even amoeba could not have taken birth in this universe. This is called law of chance in Science. These biologists do not say God but they say we do not know of a human but must be a force that has created this universe. Even saying this much by them is good enough. Now that human being Is standing up and is looking at the universe they find themselves different from all animals. It is hard for us to imagine that how different we are from animals. It is surprising to believe that we have evolved from animal stage to human. But it is not hard to believe this if you think we can never reach moon via aeroplane. About 25-30 years back we could not even think of going towards moon. Even if anyone used to think like that, people used to laugh at them. It used to be considered impossible. Today if man has reached the step of moon, it is also a step towards evolution. You may have noticed, the spacecrafts launched in space have 4 types of explosions set in them. First explosion takes them to a certain distance, suppose their speed is 10000km. Second explosion increases their speed about 10 times. Third explosion increases the speed to another 10 times. Fourth explosion increases the speed to yet another 10 times. If these explosions would not take place, then with the same initial speed the spacecrafts can never reach the moon. Same thing has happened in the evolution of man kind, to reach a progressive state of evolution a forceful explosion took place. That’s how human being has reached a state in a very small period of time, in a surprisingly short period, where he can learn a lot and understand a lot. But he still has to learn a lot more. As I had said before, the beat (spandan) in our hearts that’s taking place, what is causing it. If you ask this question of doctors, of any well educated reputed doctors, they will all have one response that it is caused by a system which we call autonomous nervous system. Mankind is not able to go beyond this. They have been only able to name this phenomenon. If we ask how is our state functioning, then they will say there is an organization called Govt of India which is doing the work. This is not a very scientific response because this answer does not explain what this organization is, how it functions and how it executes. Just giving it a name has not answered the question. But science has not evolved to give a name to a phenomenon but to explain how this evolution, this universe, this genesis, all this took place. Weather science reaches that goal or not, you all can reach there. Viewpoint of science is very analytical. As you know, there is one doctor for one hand and there is a different doctor for the other hand. It is very hard to get all comprehensive knowledge from science. Like we see a tree and all the flowers on the tree. Some people say this flower color should be yellow, some say this flower color should be blue. Only if one reaches the source of it all, they can explain the behavior of the tree – why are the flowers different color, why are leaves different from each other, because you have got the root of the subject. 
Here in Mumbai, when we talk to people, they say Mother people do not have food here, there is no sugar available, what are you talking about God. This is right for people to say. People say, what are you after during such periods. But if you think for a moment, why is this all happening that in your country there is not enough ration to feed public. In America, people are committing suicide, running away from their homes, going mad. Where is there is no human crisis. If you talk to anyone in the world, it will seem like everyone is in grave difficulties. Whether people have food or not, children or not, there is not one single happy person in the world. If food makes people happy, then I don’t see people with full stomach happy either. What is the reason that they are breaking down, disintegrating slowly. The reason is that if the tree becomes too big and expands a lot in outward direction, but does not catch on and gets in touch with its own source and roots then it starts to disintegrate. It is important that we know where we get all the energies from and research the source from which we take the energy. Until we reach the source of that energy, each and every human being, every country, it will all disintegrate. This world will have to come to an end. The one that gives origin, vitality, one that is Chaitanya itself, until we discover it we will all become devoid of awareness (Chaitanya), we will be as good as dead. The world will come to an end. So you can understand how important it is to find that power that is going on in our hearts as hearbeats. And it is an onus on us, our responsibility to know what it is. This heartbeat with all of you is working our digestion, our respiration. So go and find out what is this power. Otherwise the whole universe, this creation of God will come to a standstill and this responsibility lies with the mankind. It is only the human today who is is standing at the edge of the universe. Today humans have this power within themselves that they can learn about. Animals like dogs and cats cannot understand that. Shall I have to go to the forest to the dogs and cats and suggest them to learn about their power? It is you all that I have to tell again and again that the power that is responsible for our life, you must get to know it. And you see the result of not being familiar about this power. There is no peace for humans. They go to forest, leaves homes, leave this world, but there is no peace for them, there is no joy. Their power is going weak, they are struggling. Simply it can be explained that the fuel that has been filled in you, the fuel of the power that has been filled in you that power is going to guide you. Using one’s execution ability one should work this power. if the fuel filled within you is not utilized then that instrument is wasted. It is important. But to refill the fuel process is not available. When a child turns 3 years of age, then the opening to fill the fuel is closed. And the way that fuel is being filled within him is broken down. This power is called the energy of Kundalini. You must have read and heard thousand of things about the energy of Kundalini. But I believe that very few people have knowledge of this energy. Reading whatever has been written, writing by copying what has been written, is no real writing. If you come join our meditation program, we will show you the movement of Kundalini within you. Below the spine, in a triangular bone resides the Kundalini. You can see it, we are not talking in air baselessly. Its movement, its rise and coming down, you can witness it with your hands. A number of doctors in our country and a number of psychologists have got their realization i.e. they have been able to feel this energy. They accept this fact. But who listens to them, who even listens to me. May be in another ten years, if this concept comes from America then we will pay attention to it. Because it is hard for us to believe that anyone can do something like this. How can a simple housewife do a work like this? In reality, since childhood I could see Kundalini and knew everything about it. But I used to not understand why is human the way he is. Why does he think as if he is Shivaji maharaj while watching theater. Why does he forget that he is playing a theater. Little children create their games and they play them and then throw all that away. No one gets attached with those games. But here we are who think any game is our own game. Little children make homes in their games and break them. But we play this game and consider ourselves attached to this game. Little children make a play house and then leave it, create something else to play with then leave that too. Children come to our meditation program and ask Mataji why are you playing doctor game. They think this whole world is a game. Why is it that when we grow up we do not take this as a game. What is there to get so serious about it. I will tell you an interesting event. Some people were travelling by plane. They carried some weight on their heads. So someone asked them why are you doing that. They replied very seriously that they are trying to reduce the burden of the plane. This is what we are doing. In reality, we have no work. We don’t have to do anything, just like work of this microphone is to take my voice to you. but if the microphone starts thinking that it is its own job to speak, then I have a problem with that. So if microphone starts speaking, then my voice will come to an end. We don’t specifically do anything, like if these fingers think and one finger thinks that I am special and I have to do something special . This finger is associated with the body and is running on the same energy as the body is. It is a part and parcel of the body, just a body part. To think of this finger as separate, we are all running on the same energy. It is possible that this finger has been exchanged, same way we have been exchanged or have moved away from this power. All these lights here are being lighted by the same energy. It is possible, that one light bulb is taken out and is attached to a battery separately. But the battery is also charged by the same electricity. May be it is possible, that you all have separated yourselves taking your own energy. There are two types of energies flowing in a human being, with one he fills it and with the other he expends it. And two organizations called ego and superego develop and cover his whole being. And that is why he gets separate from this all pervading energy. This is what I need to open within you. AS soon as it gets open, you get to know this energy and you are experience peace within. Not just that you get peace, but also get patience, you are completely relaxed.
It is very important. And what is important, that does take place, it has to take place. For example, when we see an object falling, we tend to prevent it. Similarly, to stop collapse of this world, God almighty has invented Sahaj yoga. Sahaj yoga is not produced by me. No finding is ever done by us anyways. Just like the finding of gravity, it is not produced by us, the gravity was always there. We only discovered it. What is within you and what is your birth right, I have identified it. You can have it. And to find it, I have spent a lot of time. And now it has been found. This knowledge will need to be spread all over. Spreading this knowledge will take away all your problems away. Especially today’s youth, seeing them you all are perplexed that what has happened to them. As if there is no control on them, something has to be done for them. There is no other way to fix them other than Sahaj Yoga. In children, sahaj yoga works very fast. Children get it unusually fast. Whenever I have made this arrangement in schools, I have seen that 80 percent of children get it right away. Same small children, when they go to high school, it takes them longer then. This percentage comes to 60-70 in that age group. But college going kids in India, who knows what are they made of . It is very difficult for them. Some universities invited me and the Vice Chancellors of those places come and tell me Mataji , please do something or we will be shamed. These children are like monkeys and you have to fix them. I say why leave on me, they go no we cannot do anything now. They say no we wont do anything. These children have really reduced themselves to low level. Hippisim has entered America but it is to come here too and you have to be careful about that. To ignore that problem is not going to solve the issue. If you think about the progress of your country and that of other countries too, then remember that the whole responsibility lies on the youth. They will have to be corrected via Sahaj Yoga. Sahaj yoga means God Almighty’s love. And only a realized person can do it. The one who is laden by this love and within who this energy is flowing can do this work. Those in Sahaj Yoga will get realization, they are the ones in the end to achieve this. But there are very few people. You will be surprised that after working hard for 5 years in Mumbai, in reality there are about 1000 realized people only. With a lot of difficulty, and that too have not reached there. And out of those there are 11 people who are able to give realization to others. People get their self realization very quickly in America but there style is different/unique, they change Gurus on a daily basis. One need to measure its depth, we do not know how critical it is, how urgently it is needed we do not understand that. The moment we understand it will be a fortunate moment not just for us but for the whole universe. I will continue to appeal, I will continue to say as a Mother will continuously remind her children, but the children should feel the hunger themselves. If they do not have an appetite then, Mother can run around them and plead them as much as she can.

Those who get their self realization and are equipped with this power, they never have to face any disease. And even if it comes they can cure it, because they are given the knowledge as to how to cure which disease and how. This energy, spiritual awareness flowing in your hands, as these has been called even by Adi Shankaracharya in his books. But no one is reading those books any more these days. With these vibrations, you can do good for others too while doing good for yourselves. These people become disease free, and they make other disease free and get longevity. And not just longevity, but they achieve joy and happiness. And on top of that they achieve collective consciousness, which has not been felt and learnt about by anyone thus far. People do not know what Collective consciousness is. Lots of people have talked about Collective Consciousness but nothing specific or clear. When you go into meditation, that’s when you will understand what we mean by Collective Consciousness. What it means is that we can understand other people vibrations, we can understand the movement of others Kundalini, when we raise someone’s Kundalini with our love we also understand the blockages in its way and remove them. Sitting here you can see Nixon’s Kundalini. It sounds surprising but yes you can see it. That way you can understand what trouble he is in, what his blockage is and where the vibrations are stopping. It is not a biased assessment, that you don’t like someone or hate someone, when you are removing someone’s kundalini blockages and remove their obstacles, they will only get well being. It will be only for their good. There is no better voluntary service or social service out there. Because while doing this the person does not think that this hand is doing something good for the other hand. It is an automatic phenomenon that if one hand gets hurt, the other hand raises to make it feel better. 
What is Sahaj Yoga, what is its meaning, how to progress with it and how to get into it. I will be explaining all that tomorrow. The preface given to you today is that there is no salvation in the world without Sahaj Yoga. All the other yoga methods out there, whatever they could achieve but they cannot help you attain salvation. If the world has to get its salvation, then one has to embrace Sahaj Yoga. That is the path to God Almighty, He is the one who is doing this work all you have to do is to know it. Only thing is Sahaj Yoga works with your freedom. If you do not embrace it completely, from within, it will not work. There was a gentleman who asked me to give him realization. He came and stayed with me for 4 days. But he did not get it. He was perplexed that regular, simple housewives can get it then why not him. He said why am I not getting realization. So I said to him that the reason you are not getting realization is not me, but it is you. I am making efforts to give you realization but it is not because of me that you are not getting it. So he asked me then what is the reason for it. So I said the reason is that you have to develop that love from within. You have to have that feeling towards yourself too. The day you develop that love you will yourself get the realization. Then he took his bath at 4.00 a.m. and sat for meditation and got his realization. It seems like a wonderful and unique thing because it is a wonderful thing. Its not that wonderful things do not happen in the world. It should be adopted. One should not doubt about it or be suspicious about it.
Today we have talked from Evolution to human being . Now where does human have to go forward from here. But despite our saying and indicating to direction, the work is not proceeding forward. Weather you have this need within you or not, you have this desire in you or not or are you still lost in something nonliving. A lot depends on that. 
Tomorrow we will discuss what is in Sahaj Yoga, what do you achieve in Sahaj Yoga, these topics in detail. People were of opinion about today’s program that without meditation there is no value of Shri Mataji’s program, which is true also. Meditation should take place. Those who would want to meditate and achieve this, can stay back. Shortly, we will have meditation. After meditation, we will also see how many people can actually achieve it. Tomorrow a meditation program has been scheduled for 9.30 a.m. You all should attend that. Both those who get realization today, and also those who do not get it today, should attend that program because we should devote some time to the God. We do not give any time to God. We go to Cinema and sit there for three hours but how many hours do we go towards God. Time we give to God is when we are doing something, when we are performing a Pooja, or remembering him. There is no value of those things. First let your connection get established with God, without any connection who are you inviting and who are you remembering. 
Whoever wants to stay for meditation, please stay back for a little while. Those who do not wish to meditation, please leave now as it is not a good idea to disturb others during meditation because these people are seeking God. We should respect them. So you should not get up and go during meditation. Meditation will take about 20 -25 minutes. Those who have got their realization, can sit towards the back.
