1985-04-23 Talk To French Sahaja Yogis in Raincy ashram, Paris, France.

Talk 1

Shri Mataji: Nabhi chakra is rather, Nabhi chakra. Is [the switch way] of Pingala Nadi, Nabhi chakra.
Sahaja Yogi: All right, that way.
Shri Mataji: All right. Then? So, who was first?
Sahaja Yogi: Say something to Gauri, no?
Shri Mataji: We called her Gauri, right? Gauri.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s a boy’s name.
Shri Mataji: It’s a boy? Boy. So we can have the Gauri Kumar. It’s a name of Ganesha. Son of Gauri Kumar. He’s smiling. Achcha, you said boy… Gauri Kumar.
Sahaja Yogi: [French]

Shri Mataji: Now, we have many Sahaja Yogis here who have been also married in France, and there will be more coming down who really ought to send them in the centre in Paris and other places. I feel that this year has not been very good for Sahaja Yogis, and there has not been much growth as it should have been. I don’t know why but it is always to be understood that when Sahaja Yoga does not expand there’s some sort of a negativity in the Sahaja Yogis, because all the nature, everything works out for you. As soon as you change the whole atmosphere changes and you get a big response from outside. 
I’ll give you an example of England now. In England we had one girl- lady, as you know , Gavin’s wife, who was very negative. And since she’s gone away England has taken such a big stride, you’ll be amazed, they are very different people altogether. This time I saw them in Birmingham and I was amazed at their collectivity, their responsibility, their understanding of Sahaja Yoga. It’s amazing, absolutely amazing. And that’s what I feel : if there is negativity within us, then the things do not work out. So the first thing is to get the blessing and the grace of your Mother. And that is important because you must learn to surrender and to progress in your ascent. 
Sahaja Yogi: Marie tu peux traduire? [Marie, can you translate?]
Shri Mataji: You all understand English? 
Sahaja Yogi: No Mother, we don’t know. 
Shri Mataji: I said that this year has been rather disappointing.
[Sahaja Yogini translates]
Shri Mataji: So you have to discipline yourself, first of all, in Sahaja Yoga. That is, you must get up in the morning, meditate in the morning time, pay full attention to your Sahaja Yoga thinking that you relate every thing to Sahaja Yoga. You should not be complaisant, only worried about your comfort and your food, but more worried about your meditation. 

So the another thing is that you must understand, those people who do not have jobs, do not get the discipline of doing the job. This is one of curses in the West that you can live without job. It’s a curse because you have lost your discipline. You should never give up a job, if you have, at any cost. You must be in a job, must be doing something, or the dynamism goes away. You must have a regular habit because you have already been ruined. 

Now in England, I gave a nice lecture about children also. Now if some women have children they have a habit of using that as a pretext not to mix with others. They just take the child inside, sit inside, don’t mix up with other people, just become un-collective. And they think that’s what their job is. 

Now so in England, supposing not here, if you have your own house, if you have a little baby, still you have to sweep and chop and cook and shop and do all, all the things alone. You cannot just sit in the room saying: “But this is my child. I’m looking after the child.” At least, the lecture that I gave here, I hope you take the tape to listen to, that too much fussing of the child, all the time cuddling of the child, just saying: “This is my child,” it’s an absurd thing, because that’s how the children hate the parents here, cause they get bored with their parents.

In England we had an experience as there’s one child born in Chelsham Road, and the people spoilt him completely so much so, that he became like a mad man, actually like a very criminal ideas. So we have to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis and we must have discrimination, our Hamsa must be good. And to get the Hamsa right, you know that you have to put ghee in your nose every day! There should be a regular schedule, regular programming in an ashram, and they should work out that, and you must listen to somebody who tells you what is to be done. I mean, to produce a child is nothing great, what is so great? And that should not be an excuse for a man or a woman to get out of the collectivity and try to build up their own style. So the children themselves will be spoilt and you will lose your vibrations. So the blessings of a Realized soul will turn out to be a curse.

Now whatever I am saying today, I have to say. I don’t like to say, but I have to say it because the French must know why we are not growing. The child must be given to other people, to sleep with, to play with, without any reservation. You know, in India, it is bad manner to say: “This is my child.” And also to carry your own child in the presence of others is bad manners, [nd I think also here. 
[Laughter. Inaudible]
So that they, they understand the collectivity. The children must be told about Sahaja Yoga, they must be shown My photographs. I’ve seen some children when they see Me they don’t even recognize Me. Very surprising, Sahaja Yogis’ children. So that when you become disciplined, proper Sahaja Yogis, you get ideas how to spread out. Now we were working today on how to establish Sahaja Yoga on a grand scale here. With Remo I was talking what we have to do. Go and see Ambo and what you have to talk to Ambo. And that thing also I’ll give him so that you make use of it, get something better he cannot [Unsure?]. But first of all, you should not be complaisant people, just enjoying the comfort of the house, living very happily here. That’s a wrong thing. 
[Marie translates]
Shri Mataji: Like in India meditation…
Marie: Sorry, Mother.
Shri Mataji: I’m sorry 

Shri Mataji: Now, one of the impressions Indians have about French that they are very food-oriented and fussy about food. And they are very, you see, they feel hungry very fast and say: “I’m hungry,” too much. And they want their timings very correct. But do you know, your Mother is now sixty-three years of age. And sometimes I have My food at twelve o’clock, one o’clock, two o’clock in the night. And I’ve not eaten the whole day. And sometimes I don’t have food for the whole day. And if you ask Me:“What did You eat in the morning?” I won’t be able to tell you because I just don’t know if I have eaten or not. For example, this morning they asked Me: “Will You have Your breakfast?” I said : “I had My breakfast.” 
They have to tell Me that: “You have to eat, Mother, now.” I never, I’ve never asked: "You have anything for Me ", have I? Today also you had to tell Me whether it’s time for Me to have some lunch.

So every country has its own speciality, and that becomes subtler when you become a Sahaja Yogi. The, apart from that, you see, we have some other speciality for French, that you had before Sahaja Yoga, but after Sahaja Yoga I’m very happy that you are coming - overcoming. And that you have now sanity of married life and you are leading a, not a hypocritical life anymore. And that now you are not indulging into secretive, nonsensical stuff which gave you problems.
So I would suggest that you reduce the food orientation. You must fast or do something like that to reduce this orientation which is a very subtle thing in the minds of the French. It is French cuisine and all that to be complimented. So we must get rid of this starving too much. This is putting down our attention to something very gross. 

It is not immoral to think about food, but it is not sahaj. You see, I have the example for you [unsure]. For example, I don’t know what is French cuisine, I don’t know anything about this part, but I cook very well Myself. I’m very fast. 

So now what we have to have is a very concentrated effort to work on two chakras, one on the Mooladhara and another on the Nabhi. I’m coming for Guru Puja; that is for the Nabhi. And the, one of the qualities of the Nabhi is that when you become the guru, you become an ideal for others. You don’t demand anything and you sacrifice everything that is possible. You don’t get attached to anything. If you want to be a good guru, first of all you should be the example. And that is what is to be seen that you face yourself up and find for yourself where are we less in our guru mastery. That means you have to master yourself on the Nabhi chakra, you have to be your own master. But to be the master you have to listen to others, regularize yourself, go into a tapasya, into a penance sort of things. To master yourself, you have to work it out yourself. 

For this Mooladhara, there’s a very good tape and also Gavin is going to send a circular for people or he might inform you how to improve the condition of Mooladhara within you. So you see, you first fix your Mooladharas properly. But Mooladhara can only come with the discipline of your mind. And that discipline of your mind can only be managed by you because you have to see your own mind how it works, how it dissuades you from the path of ascent. It could be some relationship, might be the husband, might be the wife, might be your children or might be some Sahaja Yogis forming into groups. It could be anything. But whatever it is, you must stand out from it, detached, completely, and see for yourself that it is detrimental to your growth. 

Now, see, yesterday we had about hundred, over, over hundred new people. Now, they had never known about Me, they had never seen Me before, it’s just on a photographs that they came: why? Why this? They had not even heard My name before, some of them. But why don’t they come to your program when you arrange? What is the difference? It’s the caliber. The, I am a tapaswini, I am a Yogini.

See, Warren was travelling with Me. He got sick, hardly he got sick. See, he was with Me, not even for half, half the time and he got sick four times. But he is the maximum, I would say. But everybody is in a relay race, you see, I’m the marathon. [Laughter]
You can Me [inaudible]
In the month of July, I’ll be going all over this Europe, America. I cook in the house, I have to change my house, I have to sell  my house, I have to build then another house in India. With all that together with Sahaja Yoga all the time. 
Only one thing, that the purest desire is in my being itself, that people should be saved. It is such an earnest desire that I don’t see the comfort, I don’t see any running away from it, neither I see food, nothing, to Me the only desire is to save as many as possible at this age. 

That is the Primordial Kundalini Itself before you. But what about your Kundalini, the pure desire? The very vivid strand has come up which has given you only one side, a very vivid that you’ve got your Realization, that’s all. But what about the rest of it which is there, potential within you, which has to rise in you to feel absolutely, completely doing this job?

Now, when we had the fight for Independence everybody gave up their families, houses. My father went to jail twice for two, three years, and we were a family of eleven children. And we were rich, very, very rich people, but we had to live in huts and we were in jails, and troubled and tortured. And My mother went to jail five times. But nobody minded it because it was such a purpose of freeing Indians. But this is a greater war where we have to get to the freedom of the soul. But what is the quality of Sahaja Yogis? They are mediocre. Even some of them are just here to take advantage of the situation, that’s all. We really need warriors: Nirmalites, we call them. Have you heard of the song they have made about Nirmalites? In, you see, now we have started to call ourselves as Nirmala Vishwa Dharma, means universal immaculate religion. So to belong to that dharma is a war of this great religion of the Spirit. 

We talk of the blessings of Sahaja Yoga, how we got married, we have children, we are having a nice time, there have beautiful houses we’ve got, God has been so kind. He has given us this and that. What about you? What have you given to Sahaja Yoga? It has given us bliss, it has given us this. But what about you people coming up? Only what is needed in you is nothing but inner personality to develop. Each one of you can hold a meeting and can get the same kind of people I can get. Why not? Because you must also be knowledgeable about Sahaja Yoga. Are you knowledgeable? You are just drifting in the joy of Sahaja Yoga but what about the knowledge? 
[Marie does not translate “joy” but says “bliss”. Shri Mataji understands it and corrects her]
Shri Mataji to the translator: Not beatitude.
Marie: Bliss?
Shri Mataji: No... Joy is essence.
Marie: Joy is “joie” and bliss is “béatitude” [French words].
Shri Mataji: What I suggest because, you see, little bit I know but- all right,   
doesn’t matter. 
What I am trying to say that this [joy] is another temptation. You are capable of great ascents and great leadership. But I am surprised that still you are not aware of what you have got. You should really go on a rampage. In these holidays, for example, you can take a bus, go round with a banner and all that, station yourself in a village, talk about Sahaja Yoga, hold a meeting there, arrange something, talk to people. Go on spreading it. There’s a lot of holidays. You can work it out! 33 :46
Yes. They are going to do this in England. There’s nothing to feel shy about it. You have to carry the banners and you have to sing the songs. You have to go to streets; you have to go to the streets and do it! 

I was in the, on the Delhi station, and the train was late for about two hours. And there was a lady who came who knew I was Shri Mataji. She stood before Me, hands like this [open]. And then people asked her what a badhjan [unsure] that this Mataji is going to perform.
And even the coolies, and say- they are the people who take the luggage up - all of them lined up together, the officers and everything, and they all got their Realization, all the platform.
There were some villagers from Rajasthan who were travelling. They heard about Me and they started singing the Mother’s song and they came down to get their Realization. 

And we had one American lady with us, and she was feeling very funny about it. And she said that: “You were giving Realization even to the coolies?” As if it is the right of only those sophisticated or those Americans to have the Realization. But I said: “One coolie of India is equal to thousands of Americans, it’s a fact!”. Not only Americans, even French. 
[Laughter]
Even Indians when they come to France they become like you, I am surprised, they become complaisant like you, instead of giving you greater force. Now, Avdhut is coming, I hope he doesn’t becoming food-addicted or something like that. 

Like it's now with this child. I hope he doesn’t become like you. I hope so. [Hindi]
I don’t know what is going to happen to you. I hope he is not mesmerized by you people. But I am really surprised that there’s no energy. There’s no sort of a strength to count on, to work it out. It looks very selfish then, you see, that people come for their own, own betterment. That’s all. You don’t think of others. There’s no compassion, that force of compassion, that compels Me at this age to travel like this. You must think of others who are drug-addicted, [this/think] that so many problems in this country. This is the end of the world. And you have to be much more stronger, much more working, much more fighting, because this is the hell. I have said this before many a times. Because Mario asked Me, “Why do You come?” Five times I came in the first year. I said, “Because this is the hell. I have to work it out here, in France.” I will marry you to form a nucleus or a group like that, but that you’ll be strengthen on your Mooladhara, that you will work harder, that you will fight better, with the power.

In India, in the history we had women who used to send their husbands with the blood on their foreheads saying that ,“You are not going to come back defeated.” We had women of such character that one day I will tell you about them, how they made their men so great. This is what it is, the French women themselves have brought this, you see, womanish type of a cultural development in France. I tell you, it’s a very womanish style, that [leads] to downing of men. Now you be brave and you fight it out. I’m sure that we’ll one day create a new world in France if you really decide today and take a vow in your heart that we’ll do it, in France. There’s no need to have education or anything very great about it. Only thing, you must take a vow and have that desire foremost before you. With your discretion, with your foresight behavior, with your character, I’m sure you will establish that. You are on the warpath. You cannot be casual. You cannot be just laughing, smiling, talking, and this is not the thing. You have to be serious about it.

Thank you [for everything]. Thank you [for everything]. So I’m sorry for the first day I’ve come here to tell you this but I would like to see somebody can speed [it] here. They are working out something through Ambo also. But before that there has to be some presentation of people who… [Missing part].
