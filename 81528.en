I came to Sahaja Yoga because of my father. He was really seeking a lot, and I was only a child, so I didn't know much about it. I was in Bombay—it's called Mumbai now—and I was about to have my exams. The very next day were my exams, and my father had gotten his realization just the day before. This was in 1972.

My father's story was that he said to his best friend, "I want something where I don't have to depend on a guru." In India, gurus normally either take money or they have some sort of thing that they can't give to the disciples. I still remember hearing him say that to his friend. He said, "It would be nice to have something where I can stand on my own feet and do something myself."

His friend replied, "Oh really? I know a lady they call Shri Mataji. I'll take you there."

So he went, and he came home and said, "I've gotten this realization!" He took my mother and my brother as well, and we got our realization there. And that was it, really.
