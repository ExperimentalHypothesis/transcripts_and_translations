Shri Mataji teaches bhajans, Ashram in Le Raincy, Le Raincy (France), May 4th, 1982

[Tape 2; talk on video, Shri Mataji Teaches "Amhi bhi ghadalo" to Yogis, Marati 2.]

Shri Mataji: .....This one,
Sahaja Yogi: Too hard I must say.
Shri Mataji: I tell you.
In this song, you say "Aadi Kundalini". You see, the "a" is a long "a" and "di" is short, "aadi".
Sahaja Yogi: "Aadi".
Shri Mataji: So, in the same way, the whole thing is written. You see, "Raama",
Sahaja Yogi: "Rama"
Shri Mataji: "Raama". So if you stay at "Ra-ma-i" then it's long. If you say "Ramai" that's all short.
"Raama". "Raama". You see, this is the thing. You must understand where is the long one, we call it "dirgha" ["दीर्घ"], it's the long. Then "laghu" ["लघु"] is the small.
So whenever it's long, you should keep it long. In the whole pattern, it's the same because tune is the same, there's no new tune in it. All right?
[Shri Mataji reads the song]
Gregoire: When we'll write to Bombay and Dehli people that you sang for us Mother, they will be [Inaudible] of jealousy.
Shri Mataji: I've sung for them, many.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Same with this "Amhi bhi ghadalo", the same.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Mother?
Shri Mataji: You must understand where is the long where is "laghu". But I knew it's too elaborated [Inaudible].

Now let's sing "Amhi bhi ghadalo".

Sahaja Yogi: First page.

Shri Mataji: Am-hi bhi gha-da-na. You see, when you are saying something "AmHi" "Ami" – "AM Hi", "M" and "H"
"Amii"
Sahaja Yogi: "Amhi bhi gadalo",
Shri Mataji: "gh, gh, gh",
That's it, "bhi ghadalo",
All right, doesn't matter, you can't say "you" also,
"Amhi bhi gHadalo".
[French Sahaja Yogis try it]

Shri Mataji: "Amhi bhi ghadalo, tumhi bhi ghadana".
"Tum Hi" means "Ma" is half and "Pa" is full [unsure].
"Ma"
Sahaja Yogi: "Ma"
Shri Mataji: "Tumhi"
Sahaja Yogi: "Tumhi"

[Sahaja Yogis sing, Shri Mataji sings along]:
Amhi bhi ghadalo, tumhi bhi ghadana
Matajinchya sange mule bhi ghadali
Mule bhi ghadali chaintanyat anhali
Amhi bhi ghadalo, tumhi bhi ghadana

Shri Mataji: Hello, one second. It's all right but you when you sing, it's more sort of a Frenchie' style, you cut it, you see.
"Amhi bhi ghadalo, tumhi bhi ghadana"
[Laughter]
You understand. Indian style is that-"Amhi bhi ghadalo, tumhi bhi ghadana".
It's a melody.
You see? That thing [cut] is not there.
"Matajinchya sange mule bhi ghadali"
It should not be into the ear distortional.
It should not be discordant to the ear.
Again.

Just hold it [the note] don't play.

[Sahaja Yogis sing, Shri Mataji sings along]:
Matajinchya sange mule bhi ghadali
Mule bhi ghadali chaintanyat anhali
Mule bhi ghadali chaintanyat anhali
Amhi bhi ghadalo, tumhi bhi ghadana

Sahaj Yoga sange badha bhi ghadala

Shri Mataji: Now, you see now there are three words, Sahaja has come now. You see, Mataji is different and Sahaja well [unsure]. Then you have to pronounce it that way.

Shri Mataji: You see, this one is one, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Now you sing.

This is the bhajan "taal" and in this thing, you have to beat "ti, ti, ti" you see? You are doing it very well! So now you go and work. And you sing it out, ok? All right.
Let's finish. David, come along, let's sing. You, English, you 'll have to sing this song, now come along now.
[Laughter]
English must sing Marathi songs. Come along, David. He's good at this you know, Rabin and this Marcus all these are quite good at that. Come along, let's have one more tune. They have very good voices they're a bit shy.
