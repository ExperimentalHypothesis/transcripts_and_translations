Transcript Of Talk Satya Yuga: The Unconscious1978-0408 Caxton Hall, London

Shri Mataji: May God Bless You All!

You all can see Me, is it? Or should I stand up?

Today is a great day, a very, very great day. I had said about this [UNCLEAR six years]  back (?or so).  That first day [UNCLEAR,  the ninth night]  in this year will start the  manifestation of the new age. Of course, the new age has come  long time back,  but the manifestation could  not work out that much,  [UNCLEAR] start its manifestation.  But I find that  attitude of human beings  towards anything divine working is  little straight.  It had  been very straight.

If it was not, they never recognised Christ. They never recognised Rama. They never recognised Krishna. In the same way, they (?)  never recognise also Satya Yuga, this  new age. When these people came, nobody bothered. Those who bothered were only bothered as to see how they kill or torture them. Nobody could see through their principles, through their lives,  their powers that there is something great in these incarnations, and we must make use of it.

The reason is, man has  his old ways of (?terminology).  For example, a man  go through  a garden. The first thing is  (?to find out) who has made this garden. Who is the one  who has planned it. Then he will find out who is the person who has been the gardener. Then he finds out from where the water is coming. Then he starts counting the trees. Then he starts counting the fruits. Then he starts counting the roots. I mean, all sorts of funny things.

The attitude is so fun  that all the effort that is put in to create  a garden is lost. Now the garden is created for people to go and rest and enjoy it. But  they will take  their statistics there.  They  take out there the  computers. They will take  there all their books and (?sit),  and make it [UNCLEAR], so useless. In the same way, they feel  talk  the incarnations  and even  [UNCLEAR].

Now see the other side. The sun rises. Sun is not bothered. It is not bothered as to who  comes to bask in his glory. What the sun does is to throw the light. The sun wants to make  you happy,  wants to give you joy and balance. That’s  his job and that is why he was created. It is not counting “how many heads I am enlightening?” It is not counting, “How many doors  I’m knocking through? How many windows do I have to open?”. It is not bothered. Now, if somebody wants to get the sunshine, he has to come out and open himself and take the sunshine.

On the contrary, people would say, I mean, I as they say for incarnations, that - why if it is the sunshine  in my window  is darkness? If there is a sunshine, my room must be completely enlightened. Not only, but in the cellar, if I go, it should be enlightened. Even if I go inside   the cave, it should be enlightened. If I’m standing  in the centre of a tunnel also, it should be enlightened. And even if I cover  myself,   is completely dark, still I must see the light. This is the demand.

Now the poor sun, has/is to be crucified (?) . This is the position of human beings when they look at anybody who has come to give light. That they want, “Once we have got  Realisation, we should  get everything in a package deal. Why shouldn’t we?”.  Actually, that you have got  Realisation itself is a very big boon!  Itself is a very big happening in your life which has happened out of grace. After all, if you sit down and see,  “what have I done after all to get  Realisation?”.

You know, people have to go to jungles. They have to stay in forests where there are tigers and all kinds of dangers. And their gurus make them go round and round and round and round,  and never give them  Realisation still [UNCLEAR]. You have to give up your family, live a very celibate life and then get the  Realisation [UNCLEAR, there]. And then also it is [UNCLEAR]. So, forget about these horrible fake ones who are in the cities  and are just making money and all kinds of things.  I am not talking about them. But the real (?ones). If you have got  the  Realisation, you  shouldn’t get it as a  matter of pride [UNCLEAR]. But, you have been chosen by God. Definitely, that is why you have got  Realisation.

There must be some reason for you have been chosen.  But if you are chosen,  if a candidate is chosen for a job, he has to be worthy of it. On the contrary, what we demand – like every labour union does that. Once we have got the job, whether we do it or not, it is our right to have more pay. Whether the company is making a profit or not, it is our right to have more pay. It is not our duty to work, but it is our right to have the pay. But if  is  [UNCLEAR, gain], who is the [UNCLEAR, creator]?  Because the sun is not the [UNCLEAR]. It is the one who shuns (?) and runs into a  tunnel. He will go  on shouting, “Oh Sun, if you are there, then I must get light here.  If you are really there,  this must happen to me”. So the sun will say, “All right, my child, go ahead, with your [UNCLEAR/obstacle/obstinacy]”. So the attitude of a human being  had  been of this kind. And that is the reason why, so far, incarnations have been failures.

Another, another very big problem [UNCLEAR] which perhaps (?is that those who rise and get it) [UNCLEAR]. You don’t realise – that is another very, very big problem, which means,  a person [UNCLEAR] . A person, like the sun, [UNCLEAR]  And the  person who is seeking the sun, who is having  [UNCLEAR]. That is/there is a tremendous reason,  because when you are searching, you are counting every stone by which you pass,  you count every turn you take,  you count every tree [UNCLEAR],  you write books about what dangers you have had. And that model of yours is not known   to the person who is the [UNCLEAR, searching], because he is standing there  on  top of the hill.

For example, I don’t know, supposing tomorrow [UNCLEAR/ if I am an ignorant person] that who is the prime minister of England. What does it matter? An incarnation will not get any marks in your master mind for [UNCLEAR]. Not even a single mark he will get. He may not know the [UNCLEAR] in such and such year who was born, and in such and such year who has  died – all this knowledge is avidya.  He is  not [UNCLEAR] know all this. Because he is [UNCLEAR]. All this knowledge  that  a master might  have– who wrote this book, and who wrote that book – this knowledge has no value for the subtle.

Because these are  changing  every day. Today somebody is  a prime minister, tomorrow somebody will be the prime minister, or he will be  a prime minister, or she will be the prime minister, or he will be the president – it’s  all changing. Has no value at all of eternal nature, no value – just think of it. Just like your clothes, you are changing every day. [UNCLEAR]. So this knowledge, if you go and ask  - (? if we say Christ come here, and if you ask Him  He will say, - ‘I have no idea what is it.”

But there are some people who can just tell you what is the dimensions of this room. Or they can even tell you,  masterminds  will tell you  from where it has come, who has maintained it, who has done it and all that. Or maybe somebody else who can find out something from science, and maybe he (?can explain it). But to an incarnation or to a Sakshi,  this is avidya of no value.

Like small children counting the pebbles on the shores of knowledge. And they will go and ask their father, “Now tell me how many I have got in my hand?”  {UNCLEAR, it’s a silly question],no doubt. But they are innocent. And ignorant. Because what is (?it to the) father whether you have five or ten in your hand? Does it matter?

So, for a Sakshi the knowledge that  is important is the absolute knowledge!   Which never changes, (?which) is eternally [UNCLEAR]. The absolute knowledge,  for example, you can say, that the sun has (?) – when the sun shines, the way he  soaks, and then (?he)  transform the leaves,  and they will get chlorophyll. The oxygen which gives them life  this is the knowledge of the tree. And he does not go on counting and  making a record of how many heads [UNCLEAR]

But human (?beings are) such that they will blame the sun for giving them [a] cold. The difference between a human being  and [UNCLEAR] is that human beings think that there  are many people  in the boat,  and they are all responsible for the falling  of this one person. Like (?) And the (?subtlety  is)  that he is the only person,  nothing else. Everyone  in this world, is part and parcel (? of his being), because he is the only one in the boat  He doesn’t know  of another.

He doesn’t  know  what is the other  he just knows (? who is God) . And he is the one, the only one, that  is still; the rest are just part and parcel. He doesn’t know the difference between I and you. He doesn’t blame anyone because [if] anything goes wrong with anyone,  he is no blaming, but he is a [UNCLEAR/part in one]. If some portion dies out, it dies out. Like My  nails, if they  fall  off, they  fall.  That is of no importance to an incarnation.

He doesn’t try  to show off. He doesn’t want  to say, that “This is I, this is I, this is I” – no!  You make  it out yourself!  And he doesn’t blame you. He will never hate you, never  curse you. Can we hate our own hands? Can we hate our own eyes? Can we hate our own nose? When  everything is your own,  the word  hatred (?goes).

He doesn’t impress you  by external things, he doesn’t. He’s  not bothered as to how you should talk, how you should stand, what quote you should say  to say what thing?  Because he does not impress you by his outward behaviour. But he affects you through  his own height, by his own dignity, by his own personality. Which is within. It’s  a very deep understanding. If human beings can (?suck) that, then they will know that God Almighty has done everything under the sun to make you aware of this.

He is done  everything that can be  possible under the (?mind), to make you feel the joy that surrounds you.  He has created this (?large ...)  for you to enjoy, and He makes every effort, every effort for you to feel. But, [UNCLEAR] that there is  only one [UNCLEAR] point that you are free to  choose the light or dark.  You have been given this  freedom which,  if you want to have light, you can have. But if you don’t have it, you cannot blame God for it  – you have to blame yourself. There is something missing in you.

There is something that you have judged.  There is something that you have  avoided.  In the same way, as  today, I declared  that the new age has started, [UNCLEAR I should declare ... accept it]. But, when I say that, immediately people think you see, you  are going to get  a shower of blessings. In this new age, after all, you see, we are going to be put on the throne of the kingdom of heaven. And that nothing is going to bother us and everything is going to be worked out. [UNCLEAR].

You have to expose (?yourself) to that new [UNCLEAR, realm]. You have to open out yourself to that [UNCLEAR, realm]. There are so many ways [UNCLEAR], by which you have to open out. You know what are deities are there, how to please them, how to please the organisers within you, how to organise yourself so that you get the maximum benefit from it. I can only tell you that,  I can help you to open that.  But if you deny, if you don’t want it, nobody is going to beg of you, or  neither nobody is  going to force you!  It has to work out with your full freedom and full  asking [UNCLEAR, of it].

Of course, [the] first step means [UNCLEAR]   your Sahasrara happened despite that. Like the force of the river Ganges, just flowing  [UNCLEAR]. But the same [UNCLEAR] is your own value. But then what happens with this  new age coming?    You may say, “Mother, what special thing is going to happen?”. (?We/you see, we) have more expectations every time.  And like,  - a  mother used  to give you little  chocolates and [UNCLEAR ......]. They would like to know, “Mother, what is the special thing  we are going to get?”

Alright. (?...with the one thing of the new age, no [UNCLEAR] would be tolerated! No [UNCLEAR] would be tolerated. No heartless would be tolerated! Nobody can take away the (?scepticism) of a (?) who is sick, who are the [UNCLEAR]. Nobody can force any more to overpower any religion or a spiritual man! [UNCLEAR] unless and until he himself fall into the trip. That’s a different point. Nobody is going to be overpowered. But any satanic force [UNCLEAR]... you want, but you find out within yourself, - are you not playing into the hands of the satanic forces yourself all the time? Are you not listening to them? And even there is everything that is (?). If you are, then don’t blame Me. But, if you are not, let Satan [UNCLEAR]. All those who are (?) there (?they are not going) to come. But you have to be absolutely that! Everyone [UNCLEAR], who is very arrogant, will always say, “I am a very humble man”. And to please him, praise him, even the people,  (?they are) seeing   that.  [UNCLEAR] but I will tell you about bureaucrats. When  they want to please another bureaucrat,   they will say,   “Sir, I haven’t met  another humble men  like you”. And  they start this absolute (?madness). It’s  a common thing that people try to boast  and (?say). But,  if you are really, if you are really humble in your heart, then nobody can overpower you!  That is, what is “Satya Yuga” (the age of truth).

But we have to know how  many of us are like that.  We weep and cry and say, “Oh Lord, we have suffered so much”. We are very good [UNCLEAR] sometimes. And we can go, “How I have suffered in my life”. I mean, even Christ (?) suffered, as people say. And I find  a very big balloon of ego inside them, just settled down. And here [UNCLEAR]   the drama is coming out. I see that. Very clearly. How much  we oppress others.  How much  we (?) hurt others.  How much  we make them insecure in life.

[UNCLEAR, do we feel (?)]  If you really [UNCLEAR] in this  new age,  no one who is living here will suffer.  But [UNCLEAR] must not be your judgement but the judgement of God!  Like the saints have really suffered in the past. But how many are saints?Krishna said, “paritranaya sadhana, [UNCLEAR] sambhavami yuge, yuge.   In this world, I come again and again. To destroy the evil, evil people and to protect the sadhus, the  saints, and to establish the dharma,  “paritranaya sadhunam, dharma-samsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge, yuge.”  – ”I come again and again on this earth”. Now we have to find out how many are  real saints?  Every saint has got some sort of a, black [UNCLEAR/thing] within him. 

Thanks to these horrible gurus also, they have [UNCLEAR]. Thanks to that  [UNCLEAR] environment around [UNCLEAR]. And thanks to your own understanding and your own, I would say ignorance about  things, that they are still nicely having a very good, jolly time. At [UNCLEAR] expense. They cannot activate without your help. Without your [UNCLEAR]. Without your complete support. For those who want  that this new age should help us.This new age should give us something  special. Whatever I have promised, and  I have said today, that all those who are [UNCLEAR],  all the blessed people who are described in the Bible will receive their blessings. And nobody can overpower you, BUT, , you should judge yourself,  –   are you  that!?  To expect, even from  Realisation people  expect, that  the whole heaven  should fall into  their heads, and that all, you see, all the blessings of God should come into them – after all, what have you  done? Judge it yourself!

I’ve seen  in the West, I find ten destroying  instruments have been used socially and  [UNCLEAR]. Absolutely [UNCLEAR ... ]. Ultimately [UNCLEAR, still you] go to the society. Either you have done it or somebody (?helps/else).  One (?of two/or the other). And it is very difficult for you to separate yourself from yourself, which means, there is  ego or  superego  [UNCLEAR] . And to expect everything, you have to  know that there is a complete protection from all the angels above you.  A complete looking after, “Yogakshemam Vahamyaham” ” and a complete blessing on you, that physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and also  financially, it is a reward  – (? with which) you will be blessed.Because all these chakras are within us. But if you have no proper (? pots to receive it and   [UNCLEAR, transfer], what’s  the use of donating  [UNCLEAR, anything when all falls down?]. So today, whatever was possible had  been done for you to be the human beings and also today is the day when the complete door  of the heavens  are opened out to you, and  at this time, you have to resolve,  that, “I will try” or “I will be”  that power which is eternal,  and not waste my energy in something that is so superficial, superfluous and actually [UNCLEAR, wasting] every moment”. This resolve you have to make too. Only with this resolve will improve the flow of the vibrations.

And this is what I would like you to begin with.  Those who have got  Realisation, it is not difficult. Those who haven’t got it should be [UNCLEAR] destroying themselves [UNCLEAR]. All over the world, all over the universe, the forces are going round and round and round,  to finally work out everything (?else),  but only your opening, your exposure to them will work. And that exposure is like  an exposure of a little drop into the ocean.That’s like a little drop into the ocean. Now, if the drop says, “Oh, that means I have to surrender myself”. These are all human styles of thinking. Do I surrender my ego or my superego? You  surrender both. What you should not surrender is your wisdom,  if you have!   Wisdom is the one that will teach you how to surrender.

Neither your ego nor your superego.  It’s for you,  to understand, that you are a part, of a big part, in the drama of life. That you are going to play a very big role in the drama  of God Almighty. But, it is necessary  that you have to be prepared  to play that role. Now the last thing I want to tell you (?) today,   these I’ve seen, and I've felt  that everybody is under the impression that heaven is going to open, and that the incarnation is going to come on a horse and is all going to take us to heaven (?).

It’s  a fact. It will happen.  It has to happen. But when? When it will happen, that He will  just come  here to sort out, just to sort out all the useless ones and  take all the rights.  Like when I [UNCLEAR sentence]. He will  just (be) coming for the last cleansing!  There will be no any chance for  Realisation, no chance for emancipation, no chance for improvement!  Nothing! He will just come and throw away the hopeless  people,  and take with Him the ones who have improved themselves, who are there!

So, don’t expect, Him yet,   you are not yet ready!   Still, we are very few Sahaja Yogis and out of them, most of them are ...  So, let us postpone His (?coming) for the time being, and put attention to our emancipation to a point – where when He will come, He will take (?just us to) [UNCLEAR].

That was said because to frighten you – that you hurry up and get to the point!  But, [UNCLEAR, you will hurry up] . ...directly, absolutely, and you took two jumps to hell. And [UNCLEAR] it’s a big problem, how to raise! How to raise you from that. You don’t know, it’s  a very big problem. Though,  I smile  and laugh, inside Me, I weep sometimes, to find (?) people embedded in the mud of hatred. And in the mud of satanic forces. The whole mire!

With this new age, a new  time  has to come. And, if you want your emancipation,  you want to be there, it/you will be expedited, subtly improved  with that love. And you are going to  be helped much more. Because  the surroundings  will be cleared, you will feel the awareness of the people. People will change their attitude (?as they are). And they will take to the eternal values. The value structure in man will be changed. His priorities will be changed. The value structure in the society will be changed. This truth can happen. And you will be benefitted by it.

Actually, the whole value structure of human beings is so badly damaged and so perverted that to put it right itself has been a very big problem.   Especially  in the darkness is no [UNCLEAR] problem, in the dark  is better, but when the sun is on top of your head, you can feel (?even) better and better and better. So, we have  [to be] on these  changes grateful  and for  I have to tell you things, which hurt you. But on such a day, I have to tell you the truth. [UNCLEAR for a few statements],  ... a mother has to tell them what they should eat,  what they should not.

You cannot give them sweet things when they are not well. You have to give them insipid, horrid things (?to make them well). [UNCLEAR ...],  you cannot give them what you want to give,  because they are sick,  their stomachs are upset. Their minds are upset. So I request you, all of you, to work everything that is possible  to put yourself in  proper place, so, that the value structure which had been not used to  settled down properly,  and that you receive the [UNCLEAR ......] And you have made a lot of mistakes in your seeking. Doesn’t matter. Everything is [UNCLEAR, solved]. I am with you. I am all the time with you. And whatever help you want, we are going to work it out. I am so thankful to you  for (?these) all days . But when I see Kalki here, I must tell you, this is a [UNCLEAR, frightening thing].  [UNCLEAR], I love Him  very much, no doubt, He is My dearest son, and everything is there,   but, He is going to come with eleven Rudras and with His three eyes, you see,  He is going to reduce everyone into ashes,  and throw away/them into the hell.

So, I just now, don’t want Him  to come. It is not the time yet. No, no. My children are still very sick; some of them are very unhappy,  some of them have been tortured, have been reduced to nothing. Let Me, let Me help them. (?Make them well). And then, when they are all right, then  He (?welcome) to come.

(?Let them be) all right. Before that, no need. And He is a very obedient child,  – He is the most obedient son. [UNCLEAR...]. And He loves Me very much. He is not going to  [UNCLEAR], but He has to kill  those, who have tried to kill all that is divine.

[Possible break in recording].

Shri Mataji:  Are you here for the first time? All others  are all old people. (Shri Mataji is laughing) Alright. Out of you, those who do not feel the vibrations,  did you come before? Did you? You felt the vibrations in the hands? Did you? No, I am asking her. You, you – I am asking her. Did you?

You felt them nicely, isn’t it? Now, what about you? Are you feeling now? Cool in the hands? Good!

Now, just put your hands towards Me like this, all of you. Hello, is she  Realised already, please see.

Are you feeling good?

Newcomer: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: There? . What are you feeling? Warm. It will go away. I promise, that’’s My grace, you see?   That you have to have a little faith in Me, something, little, not much, all right? You don’t feel I am a crook, do you? It’s all right then.

Done? All of them? What is? [UNCLEAR].  What about you? Nothing? Have you been to some guru? No one. Are  you  keeping all right, health-wise? Are you feeling any, nothing? Put your feet on the ground like that. Just (?) towards Me if you put.  You put it off now.

[Break in audio, resumes at another point].

Shri Mataji: ...some idea that there is  God. And also we know that He is reflected in us, in our heart aspect as Atma as Spirit. Now, when we know about the three channels that are working within us, of Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati, the three powers of Ida, Pingala and Sushumna, which creates the subconscious, preconscious and the conscious mind are working in our consciousness. That means we are conscious of them.

We are conscious of our left and right, that is Ida and Pingala. Sympathetic nervous system. We are not conscious of the parasympathetic. That means that  we can increase the rate of our heart, we can increase the rate of our breathing, but we cannot decrease.

A decrease or what we call lowering down of the rate is done by parasympathetic. So the parasympathetic is active, but we are not conscious of it in the sense that we have no control over it. The Spirit that is God, which is reflected in us, resides in the heart. The manifestation of Spirit in our heart controls the parasympathetic. But this Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart, as if in a mirror.

And Divine Love which is the light of God is reflected in us through the reflection of the Spirit as the unconscious mind. So within us, there is an area about which we are not conscious. That is why it is called as unconscious. That area lies so far away from our conscious mind that we cannot control it. We are not conscious of it. But it acts through parasympathetic activity.

How it acts – I will give a simile. Supposing there is a power, works somewhere, and it is acting through this light over here. You don’t see the power work or the factory or wherever the power is seen. But,  what you see is the manifestation here. And you see the light. But, suppose you do not see the light, nor the lamp, nor the factory. But you are affected by it. That is the situation of a human being.

A normal human being, who is not a  Realised soul, is not aware of that factory which is God, or the light he has got. He is not aware of the lamp that he has got in his heart,  and he is also not aware of the light that the lamp is emitting. But it is acting. So, the unconscious mind is nothing else but the projection of God’s will through the light of Divine Love.

I have given this simile again and again, which is very good and apt. That these two powers that are within us – one on the left and another  on the right-hand side, are there, and we are conscious of them, and we use them. Out of them, the right one, we use it in absolute awareness. Left one we know is used as subconscious mind and sometimes if you take drugs or if you do  something like that, then you go to your subconscious also. So you can become aware of the subconscious area also.

So you become – you are aware of the right-hand side already, and you are aware of the subconscious sometimes when you try to get aware of it. So, these two powers that are within us, are all the time vibrating in a wave.  And the points at which they meet, they create the throb,  or you can say the centre. The centre is created, a deity is created. But there is no light for us to see or to feel or to be conscious of the deities.  Deities are fast asleep.

When the Kundalini rises – now Kundalini is the subconscious. You will be surprised that Kundalini is the Mahakali power. She is absolutely pure, in the purest form. Because she is not used.  You can say part of It is used in us, our  subconscious – sort of we have kept some water separately. Which we have not used so far. So, first of all, we use the subconscious water and the preconscious water. And by, -  and we dirty it, we exhausted it.

Then this stored up power rises and does the last cleansing. But when she rises, she creates a third current. Still, that third current, when she rises, doesn’t have the light. But when it  reaches the Sahasrara and pierces it, then it becomes one with the Universal Consciousness. Because what is God? [He] Is the one who controls the Universal Consciousness. He is the  Controller of the Universal Consciousness. He emits the light. And when this Kundalini rises, it gets that frame  on it.

So, now all the deities get awakened. Now, you may say that it is in the heart, Mataji, or  saying,  -  you are saying it is here. It’s a confusion people take.  But actually, it is all-pervading faith, God is a nucleus you can say or a  factory. It has the light all over, and is reflected in the heart. So when your Kundalini, a particular individual Kundalini, touches that, then this light takes place, then the  heart, in the heart the Spirit is ignited. Or sort of it emits, it manifests, it projects. And its projections are these vibrations.

So through this, you know the will of God. Through this, you have a dialogue with God  and you understand what He wants. And what does He want you to know? There are three qualities of God which you can feel through this. One, what is the Truth. You ask any question!  If you are asking for something and if it is yes, then you get too many vibrations. If it is no, vibrations will lower down. That’s  how you can verify what is right,  what is wrong. What is the truth, what is not the truth!  Now you can know!  Nobody has to tell you. You don’t need any  clergyman or anybody to certify – is there, through your vibrations – you can feel it; this is the truth or not. Is it the correct place you have come to or  to a wrong person.

There are  also the various combinations and permutations of the diseases. It is true, but still, there’s a little point which is wrong with you. For example, if you say that Christ was resurrected in person – yes, that’s  true. You will get more vibrations. But if you feel now, that if you say, “Is it Mataji, the Mother of Christ?”, if you do not accept it – you will not get it any further.  You see for yourself.

That is how now for you to understand what is the truth. Now, once you understand the truth and if you are identified with it – it is a very difficult thing for  a mind; the Western mind -that’s why it, -  immediately what you get,  the second quality of God is joy. The second quality of the Unconscious is joy. You should hear some of the letters that people write to Me. Those who are writing [UNCLEAR, that’s why],   for Indians, it is very easy to recognise Me. You see, because they do not see (Me) only as Christ Mother,  but they know Me throughout, you see. Immediately they know the One  Who raises the Kundalini, the One, you see, when they fall at My  Feet then  the Kundalini rises, they see, finished. That’s, that’s the sign!  No problem!  For them, no problem!  So they accept it very fast.

But in these ego-oriented societies, it’s  very difficult. So they do not accept!  The problems are there. But once if you start identifying with that  truth and understanding,  just think that you are sitting before Me, and  Who am I!? Just think of that!  Who am I sitting down before!? Just say “I am (Shri Mataji is) that!”  Then see the joy. See the waves of joy which just tickle you a little bit.

But this truth is not easily identified with. If it is identified, then you get the second thing,  known as joy. Now, the third quality of God  is attention, Chitta. Means that He is attention. Can you understand that? In English, it’s  very difficult. But what I am saying, He is attention. Means, wherever He is, He is attention. Now, how would  you explain it? For example, I am sitting down here. I am not paying any attention to  Him, but I am attention. In the sense - It flows!  Like the water, you see,  you put it somewhere,  wherever there is a lower  area, it will flow to that.   The water doesn’t do anything,-   its nature is such that it flows to  that. In the same way, I am not paying consciously attention,  but My nature is attention, if you pray to Me, it will happen.

But you should be able to receive My attention, in the sense that My attention it should penetrate into your false wants.  If you are false, it will not act. Because it understands. The attention understands everything that you are. It is like a computer. Even faster than that.

Supposing My hand is here. And you prick Me with a pin. Immediately, My hand will go away like that. Immediately. Even before you have pricking  My hand, if I see. If My attention is there, on My hand, immediately all the muscles will act, and it will take  away – the hand  from there. In the same way, you can say, even much bigger than that is the attention of God. And it starts acting through you!  Anybody you want to think of, you just think of – and it acts. It spreads. It spreads, (?you see). You can attend to your relations. You can think about your mother, you can think about your father; you can attend  of that. Then you rise like this.  When you grow higher and higher and higher,  then the whooole personality becomes nothing but attention.

Is the same thing. Is the same thing expressed in three ways,  is the same thing. That when your attention is everywhere, you are joy. Because of  attention you  receive the joy, because you are Truth, that’s why you are joy, because nothing but Truth can give you joy. Falsehood can never give you joy.

For the time being, you will be happy  and unhappy. But joy is a thing, it’s  never changes its quality. It’s not a dual thing,  it’s one. Many people say like this, “I am very happy”. That’s not the joy!  It is joy!  Which cannot be described!  Just think, supposing I am that. Because for Me, still “I am a supposing”. Just think of that. If so, (after some second, Shri Mataji says)  how He’s acting through within yourself!

It’s  acting in you, and it’s excited in you. It’s the ocean of Truth, Joy and Attention. And you get that!  The way you are joyous, I am also joyous (?). The way you are standing on  Truth, I am also standing on the Truth. The way you are paying attention, I am also paying attention.

You just, by talking, you  take somebody’s name. Immediately you will get the indication on the hands. Without attention, it is not coming there. But the attention, you are not conscious of it,  it just works. Because God is giving you [UNCLEAR, attention], Who is  Attention Himself. He pays attention to everything. You are talking about  somebody, just by the way you are talking, suddenly “Oh,  thought this” . Why? “Because that has got this trouble”. Immediately, God indicates  because He is so attentive.

These are the three qualities of God which have manifested, and that is the nature of the Unconscious within us. Now it is for us to rise,  first of all, to know the truth. Now rationally you know. Rationally you know that there is something about Mataji, definitely, there is!  But emotionally, you cannot integrate. Some people know Me emotionally, but they rationally they cannot integrate.

Try to integrate both.  Start thinking by your heart and loving by your brain. Then it acts. Tell your brain to think of all the ways of loving. How do  express your love to someone in words? Start off. Just say few words. Just now, he said something – “Hail Mary  (?Grace/Face)”. From here and here and here, you see,  started going. Only that “Hail” itself works, see.  See now, only this word – how much vibrations.

It’s so simple. Nothing so complicated as the psychologists make it. Absolutely (? )  very beautiful.  But when the Kundalini rises,  She does the simple job. She is kept there for that. She knows Her  job. She is aware. She knows Me very well. As soon as She sees Me, - She rises  of course,  She is kept there only for this day when you have to meet Me. She works it out. And  She is wondering what’s wrong with these children!? Why don’t they understand!?

This is the nature of the Unconscious, about which we say we are not conscious. That (?why/way) I am conscious, but not any more with you people,  you are conscious of it. You are conscious of it. Not only that, but you know all the things. What is this, what are these  fingers.

Now think  from the God’s point of view. It’s all right from  human point of view, you always [UNCLEAR] – but think from His point of view. He wants to evolve you people,  to a higher state. You must realise with all your intelligence that still you have not reached that point, from where, you can say it is completed now!  You have not met that power which is described, which says – “Let it be” – and it happens. So there is something transition is still there, you have to achieve that point. That is true!  All right.

That means you are still unconscious of some things which  you have not known so far. You have to evolve. Now, what is the God’s position? Supposing He has been evolving you throughout. Now, at this stage when He has given you all the freedom, and like madcaps, you are trying to do something trivial. For example, a mother who allows her child to be free, and the child is going  to put the hands, - fingers in the socket. She just has to come and tell, “No, don’t do that!  That will give you burns”. She has to tell!

God has to tell you. And how is He going to tell you? He has to have a mouth!  He has to learn English!  He has to talk to you!  He has to have hands like this!  Then, otherwise, how is He  going to tell?  Human minds is  so falling  that they think that if you are helped monetarily, “Oh, God is with me!”  Is  He your servant, that  He is in your pocket? - “Oh, God was very kind to me, you see,  I went there, He was very kind to me, He helped me”.

But how do you say it was God, or what has helped you? How do you know? Everybody thinks that God is their servant standing at the door. “Oh God, do this thing,  give job to me,  give job to another person. Oh, God  will look after me. Give me food, everything. Oh God, let us win the war against this, and do this, and protect”,  and all sorts of things are done under  the name of God. But whether the  Gentleman is there or not is not known.       (laughter)

So the  Gentleman has to take a face and a mouth to talk to you. To tell you about these subtleties. They are subtle but not difficult. They are simple.  But when He takes the body, it’s a big dilemma for Him. He takes the body, people say, “How can it/you be?”. First of all, they do not believe in themselves that they can face,  that He can come,  first of all. They themselves are suffering from an inferiority complex. And they cannot think, -  how can He be a human being just like us.

But if He is clever enough, He can make a drama out of it. He can copy you better than you can copy God. That is what human beings do not  understand. That He can do everything, all types of things and whatever you are doing also is done through His help. But depends on His attention, you see!

Just now, His attention is on one thing. Throughout in the world, He wants Kundalini  awakening,  Sahaja Yoga to be established!  That what is, - think! First of all, let people feel the vibrations,  otherwise, what am I going to talk to them, and what are you going to do with that? So this is the only attention working now. There will  no miracles, nothing!   You have your  Realisation first of all!  No resurrections, no crucifixions, nothing any more!  You just have, all of you, your vibrations!  Correct them!  That’s how  you keep the lights ready. And that’s how you enlighten the path.  Now you may say, “In His light, why should we enlighten our path? . His light (is) for Himself!

You see, a potter who makes pots and  small little lights also, lamps. He makes lamps. He is light Himself, but He makes lamps. Small, small lamps. Then He fills it with  oil. Then He picks a wick of Kundalini. Then He lights them.  When such lights, fills His heart, with  reflected joy. He wants to see His reflection.
