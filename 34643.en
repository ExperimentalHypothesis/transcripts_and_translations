Transcript Of Talk Satya Yuga: The Unconscious 1978-0408 Caxton Hall London

Shri Mataji: May God Bless You.

You all can see Me, is it? Or should I stand up?

Today is a great day, a very great day. I had said about this [UNCLEAR/back]. That first day after the ninth night of this year would be the start of manifestation of the new age. Of course, the new age has started a long time back. But the manifestation did not work out well [UNCLEAR/at the start]. But I find that the attitude of humans towards anything divine working is a little strange. It has [UNCLEAR].

If it was not, they never recognised Christ. They never recognised Rama. They never recognised Krishna. In the same way, they will never recognise Satya Yuga, the new age. When these people came, nobody bothered. Those who bothered were only bothered as to see how they kill or torture them. Nobody could see through their principles, their life, their powers that there is something great in these incarnations and we must make use of it.

The reason is, man has these old ways of ignorance. For example, a man will go to a garden. He will find out who has made this garden. Then he will find out who has planned it. Then he will find out who is the person who has been the gardener. Then he finds out from where the water is coming. Then he starts counting the trees. Then he starts counting the fruits. Then he starts counting the roots. I mean, all sorts of funny things.

The attitude is so funny that all the effort that is put into creating a garden is lost. Now the garden is created for people to go and rest and enjoy. They will take all their statistics. They will take their computers. They will take all their books and sit. And make it [UNCLEAR]. In the same way, they will talk [UNCLEAR/incarnations] and see only [UNCLEAR].

Now see the other side. The sun rises. Sun is not bothered. It is not bothered as to who has come to bask in his glory. What the sun does is to throw the light. The sun wants to see you happy. The sun wants to give you joy and balance. That is his job and that is why he was created. It is not counting how many heads I am enlightening. It is not counting, “How many doors am I knocking? How many windows do I have to open?”. It is not bothered. Now if somebody wants to get the sunshine, he has to come out and open himself and take the sun.

On the contrary, people would say, I mean as they say for incarnations, that why if it is the sun that shines, in my window there is darkness? If there is sunshine, my room must be completely enlightened. Not only, but in the cellar, if I go, it should be enlightened. Even if I go to a cave, it should be enlightened. If I go to the centre of a tunnel also, it should be enlightened. And if I come out and my eyesight is completely dark, still I must see the light. This is the demand.

Now the poor sun has to be crucified also. This is the position of human beings when they look at anybody who has come to give light. That they want, “Once we have got realisation, we should just get everything in a package deal. Why shouldn’t we?”.  Actually that you have got realisation itself is a very big [UNCLEAR]. Itself is a very big happening in your life which has happened out of grace. After all, if you sit down and see, “After all, what have I done to get realisation?”.

You know, people have to go to jungles. They have to stay in forests where there are tigers and all kinds of dangers. And their gurus make them go round and round and round and round. And never give them realisation [UNCLEAR]. You have to give up your families, live a very celibate life and then get your realisation. And then also it is [UNCLEAR]. So forget about the horrible fake ones who are in the city and are just making money and all that. I am not talking about them. But the real ones. If you get realisation, you have to [UNCLEAR/matter of pride]. But you have been chosen by God. Definitely, that is why you have got realisation.

There must be some reason [UNCLEAR], but if you are chosen. If a candidate is chosen for a job, he has to be worthy of it. On the contrary, what we demand - like every labour union does that. Once we have got the job, whether we do it or not, it is our right to have more pay. Whether the company is making a profit or not, it is our right to have more pay. It is not our duty to work but it is our right to have pay. But it is a foolish [UNCLEAR/child?].

Because the sun is not [UNCLEAR]. It is one who shuns and runs into the tunnel. He goes on shouting, “Oh Sun, if you are there I must get light from you. If you are really there it must happen to me”. So the sun will say, “All right, my child, go ahead, with your [UNCLEAR/obstacle/obstinacy]”. So the attitude of human beings has been of this kind. And that is the reason why so far incarnations have been failures.

Another very big problem perhaps is that those who rise and get it [UNCLEAR]. You don’t realise - that is another very big problem. A person has to suck it. A person, like the sun, has to suck. And a person who is seeking the sun is having his [UNCLEAR]. That is a tremendous reason. Because when you are searching, you are counting every stone which you pass. You count every turn you take. You count every tree. You write books about what dangers you have had. And that model of yours is not [UNCLEAR/told to the person who is searching] because he is standing at the top of the hill.

For example, supposing I am tomorrow [UNCLEAR/telling an ignorant person] who is the prime minister of England. What does it matter? An incarnation will not get any marks in your master mind for [UNCLEAR]. Not a single mark he will get. He may [UNCLEAR] in such and such year who was born and in such and such year who died - all this knowledge is a [UNCLEAR]; He may not know all this. Because he is [UNCLEAR]. All this knowledge of the mastermind - who wrote this book, who wrote that book - this knowledge has no value for the subtle.

Because it [UNCLEAR/is changing] every day. Today somebody is the prime minister, tomorrow somebody will be the prime minister or he will be the prime minister or she will be the prime minister or he will be the president - it is all changing. Has no value at all of eternal nature, no value - just think of it. Just like your clothes you are changing every day. [UNCLEAR]. So this knowledge if you go and ask an [UNCLEAR/incarnation], he will say, ‘I have no idea what it is”.

But there are some people who can tell you the dimensions of this room. Or there are masterminds who can tell who has made it, from where it has come and all that. Or maybe somebody else who can find out something from science and maybe he can explain it. But to an incarnation or to a [UNCLEAR/saint], this is of no value.

Like small children counting the pebbles on the shores of knowledge. And they will go and ask their father, “Now tell me how many I have got in my hand”. But they are innocent. And ignorant. Because what is it to the father whether you have five or ten in your hand? Does it matter?

So the knowledge for us which is important is absolute knowledge. Which is eternal. Which never changes. For example, you can say, that the sun has - when the sun shines, the way the leaves soak and then they transform the trees and they will get chlorophyll. The oxygen which then gets [UNCLEAR]; this is the knowledge of the tree. And he does not go on counting or making a record of how many heads [UNCLEAR/are in the sun].

But human beings are such that they will blame the sun for giving them a cold. The difference between human beings and [UNCLEAR] is that human beings think they are all in the [UNCLEAR] and they are all responsible for the [UNCLEAR] of this one person. And the subtlest within, that is the only [UNCLEAR], nothing else. Everyone will start [UNCLEAR], he is the only one who [UNCLEAR]. He doesn’t know who is the other.

He just knows [UNCLEAR]. And he is the one, the only one who is still; the rest are part and parcel. He doesn’t know the difference between I and you. He doesn’t blame anyone because if anything goes wrong with anyone, it is no blaming but is a [UNCLEAR/part]. If some portion dies out, it dies out. Like My [UNCLEAR/nail] falls off, it falls off. That is of no importance to an incarnation.

He doesn’t like to show off. He doesn’t like to say, “This is I, this is I, this is I” - no. He makes out [UNCLEAR]. And he doesn’t blame you. He will never hate you or curse you. Can we hate our own hands? Can we hate our own eyes? Can we hate our own nose? But everything [UNCLEAR], the world gets [UNCLEAR/threatened].

He doesn’t impress you with external things, he doesn’t. He does not bother as to how you talk, how you should stand, what [UNCLEAR/quote] to say what thing. Because he does not impress you by his outward behaviour. But affects you by his own height, by his own dignity, by his own personality. Which is within. It is a very deep understanding. If human beings can suck that, then they will know that God Almighty has done everything under the sun to make you aware of this.

He does everything that is possible under the mind to make you feel the joy that surmounts it. He has created this large [UNCLEAR] for you to enjoy and He makes every effort, every effort for you to feel that there is a [UNCLEAR] only one [UNCLEAR] that you are [UNCLEAR/seeing] the light of that. You have been given the freedom that if you want light, you can have. But if you don’t have it, you cannot blame God for that - you have to blame yourself. There is something missing in you.

There is something that is stuck. There is something that was [UNCLEAR/avoided]. In the same way, like today, I had to clear that [UNCLEAR]. But when I say that people immediately think that [UNCLEAR/we are going to be thrown] into a shower of blessings. In this new age, after all, we are going to be put on the throne of the kingdom of heaven. And that nothing is going to bother us and everything is going to be worked out. [UNCLEAR].

You have to expose yourself to that [UNCLEAR]. You have to open out yourself to that [UNCLEAR]. There are so many ways [UNCLEAR], by which you have to open out. You know what deities are there, how to please them, how to please the organisers within you, how to organise yourself so that you get the maximum benefit from it. I can only help with that. I can help you to open them. But if you deny, if you don’t want it, nobody is going to beg of you and neither is anybody going to force you. It has to work out with your full freedom and full [UNCLEAR/asking].

Of course, the first opening of the Sahasrara happened despite that. Like the force of the river Ganges [UNCLEAR]. But the same [UNCLEAR]. But then what happens with the new age coming in, you say, “Mother, what special thing is going to happen?”. We have more expectations than anyone. As if Mother is going to give you more chocolates and [UNCLEAR]. They would like to know, “Mother, what is the special thing they are going to get?”. [UNCLEAR for a minute and a half/Mother is talking about reality not overpowering unlike the satanic forces].

Everyone who is very arrogant will always say, “I am a very humble man”. And to please him, praise him, people will do that - I have seen it. Then they want to please another [UNCLEAR], they will start, “I haven’t seen another humble person like you”. Then they start this absolute madness. It is a common thing that people try to go and say. If you are really humble in your heart, then nobody can overpower you - that is “Satya” (truth).

But we have to know how we [UNCLEAR]. We weep and cry and say, “Oh Lord, we have suffered so much”. We are very good [UNCLEAR] sometimes. And we can go, “How I have suffered in my life”. I mean, even Christ suffered. And there is this big balloon on their head, all this drama coming out. I see that. Very clearly. How much do we oppress others? How much do we hurt others? How much do we make them insecure?

We will be in darkness. If [UNCLEAR/this is the new age], no one will live here. But [UNCLEAR] must not be your judgement but the judgement of God. Like the saints have really suffered in the past. But how many are saints?  Krishna said, “[UNCLEAR] prana, sadhana, dharma-samsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge”. In this world, I come again and again. To destroy the evil and to protect the sadhus and saints, and to establish the dharma,  “dharma-samsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge” - I come again and again. Now we have to find out how many are the real saints. Every saint has got some sort of a black [UNCLEAR/thing] within him. 

Thanks to these horrible gurus also, they have [UNCLEAR]. Thanks to the environment and all there are some more that are there. And thanks to your own understanding and your own, I would say ignorance about it, they are still nicely having a very good, jolly time. At [UNCLEAR] expense. They cannot activate without your help. Without your complete support. So don’t [UNCLEAR] that this new age should help us.

This new age should give us something precious. Whatever I have promised and whatever I have said today that all those who are [UNCLEAR], that all the blessed people who are described in the Bible will receive their blessing. And nobody can overpower you, but you should judge yourself - “Are we that?”. To expect, even from realisation if you expect that all the heavens should fall on their heads and that all the blessings of God should come into them - after all, what have we done? Judge it yourself.

And in the West, I find [UNCLEAR] providing instruments have been used socially and spiritually [UNCLEAR]. Either you have done it or somebody has done it. One or the other. And it is very difficult to separate yourself from yourself when the ego and superego are this [UNCLEAR/at this level]. And to expect everything, you must know that there is complete protection from all [UNCLEAR/negative about], a complete looking after, “Yoga-kshema-vahamyam” and a complete blessing that physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and even financially, it is [UNCLEAR/a rapport] - you will be blessed.

Because all these chakras are within us. But if you have no proper use of it no [UNCLEAR], what is the use of donating (?) [UNCLEAR]. So today, whatever was possible has been done for you to be the human being and also today is the day when the complete doors of the heavens have been opened out to you and you have to [UNCLEAR/], that, “I will try” or “I will be”. That power is in your hand. “And not waste my energy in something superficial, superfluous and actually wasting every moment”. This resolve you have to make. Only this resolve will improve the flow of the vibrations.

And this is what I would like to begin with. For those who have got realisation, it is not difficult. Those who have got it [UNCLEAR]. All over the world, all over the universe, the forces are going round and round and round. To finally work out everything right, but only opening your exposure to them will work. And that exposure is like the exposure of a little drop into the ocean.

That’s like a little drop into the ocean. Now, if the drop says, “Oh, that means I have to surrender myself”. These are all human styles of thinking. Do I surrender my ego or my superego? You should surrender both. What you should not surrender is your Spirit if you have. With [UNCLEAR], that will teach you how to surrender.

Neither your ego nor your superego is conditioned to understand that you are a part, a big part in the drama of life. That you are going to play a very big role. Of God Almighty. But, it is [UNCLEAR] that you have to be fitted to play that role. Now the last thing I want to tell you today is that [UNCLEAR] everybody is under the impression that heaven is going to open and the incarnation is going to come on a horse and is all going to take us to heaven.

It is a fact. It is going to heaven. It has to happen. But when it will happen, when it happens they will be just coming here to sort out, just to sort out all the useless ones and to take the right ones. [UNCLEAR sentence]. He is just coming for the last [UNCLEAR]. There will be no chance for realisation, no chance for emancipation, no chance for improvement. He will just come and throw away the useless people. And take the ones who have improved themselves, who are there.

So don’t expect he will just, “They are not yet ready”. Still, we are very few Sahaja Yogis and out of them most of them are [UNCLEAR]. So let us postpone His coming for the time being and put attention to our emancipation to a point - where when He will come, He will take us to [UNCLEAR].

That was said because to frighten you - that you hurry up and get to the point. [UNCLEAR for a few lines]. You don’t know it is a very big problem. So I smile and laugh, inside Me, I weep sometimes to find people embedded in the mud of hatred. And in the mud of satanic forces. The whole mire.

With this new age, a new [UNCLEAR] has to come. And if you want [UNCLEAR] you want to be there, it will be expedited, subtly improving with that love. And you will be helped much more. Because of the surroundings, the awareness of the people will change. And they will take to eternal values. The value structure in man will change. His priorities will change. The value structure in society will change. This truth can happen. And you will be benefitted from that.

Actually, the value structure of human beings is so badly damaged and so perverted that to put it right itself has been a very big task. [UNCLEAR] in the dark is no [UNCLEAR] darkness, but when the sun is on top of your head, you can feel better and better and better. On this great day, I am sorry I have to hurt you. But on such a day I have to tell you the truth. [UNCLEAR for a few statements]. A mother has to tell them what they should do and what they should not.

You cannot give them sweet things when they are not well. You have to give them insipid, horrid things to make them well. [UNCLEAR]. You cannot give them what you want to give. Because they are sick. Their stomachs are upset. Their minds are upset. So I request you to [UNCLEAR/work everywhere possible] to put yourself in the proper place.

[UNCLEAR for a few statements]. And you have made a lot of mistakes in your seeking. Doesn’t matter. Everything is [UNCLEAR]. I am with you. I am all the time with you. And whatever help you want, we are going to work it out. I am so thankful today for all this. But when I see Kalki here, I must tell you, this is a [UNCLEAR]. Because I love you very much, no doubt because you are My son. But He is going to come with eleven Rudras and with His three eyes and he is going to reduce everyone into ashes. And throw them into hell.

So I just [UNCLEAR]. It is not the time. No, no. My children are still very sick; some of them are very unhappy. Some of them have been tortured, have been reduced to nothing. Let Me, let Me help them. Make them well. And then, when they are all right, then You come.

Let them be all right. Before that, no need. And [UNCLEAR] - He is the most obedient son. And He loves Me very much. [UNCLEAR] all those who have tried to kill all that is divine.

[Possible break in recording].

Shri Mataji:  Are you here for the first time? These are all old people. Out of you, those who [UNCLEAR] see the value. Did you come before? Did you? You felt the vibrations in the hand? Did you? I am asking her. You, you - I am asking her. Did you?

You felt them nicely, isn’t it? Now, what about you? Are you feeling now? Cool in the hands? Good.

Now just your hands towards Me like this, all of you. Hello, she is realised already, please see.

Are you feeling good? Yes. What are you feeling? Warm. You feel warm. That’s all right. Just have faith. Just have little, not much, all right? You don’t feel I am a crook, do you? It’s all right then?

Done? All of them? What is? [UNCLEAR].  What about you? Nothing? Have you been to some guru? No one. Have you been keeping all right, health-wise? Are you feeling nothing? Put your feet on the ground like that. Just you have to work it. Put it off now.

[Break in audio, resumes at another point].

Shri Mataji: ...some idea that there is some God. And also we know that He is reflected in us, in our heart aspect as Atma as Spirit. Now, when we know about the three channels that are working within us, of Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati, the three powers of Ida, Pingala and Sushumna, which create the subconscious, preconscious and the conscious mind are working in our consciousness. That means we are conscious of them.

We are conscious of our left and right that is Ida and Pingala. Sympathetic nervous system. We are not conscious of the parasympathetic. We can increase the rate of our breathing but we cannot decrease.

A decrease or what we call lowering down of the rate is done by parasympathetic. So the parasympathetic is active but we are not conscious of it in the sense that we have no control over it. The Spirit that is God which is reflected in us resides in the heart. The manifestation of Spirit in our heart controls the parasympathetic. But this Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart, as if in a mirror.

And Divine Love which is the light of God is reflected in us through the reflection of the Spirit as the unconscious mind. So within us, there is an area about which we are not conscious. That is why it is called as unconscious. That area lies so far away from our conscious mind that we cannot control it. We are not conscious of it. But it acts through parasympathetic activity.

How it acts - I will give a simile. Supposing there is a power work somewhere and it is acting through this light over here. You don’t see the power work or the factory wherever the power is seen. What you see is the manifestation here. And you see the light. But suppose you do not see the light, nor the lamp nor the factory. But you are affected by it. That is the situation of a human being.

A normal human being who is not a realised soul is not aware of that factory which is God or the light he has got. He is not aware of the lamp that he has got in his heart. And he is also not aware of the light that the lamp is emitting. But it is acting. So the unconscious mind is nothing but the projection of God’s will through the light of Divine Love.

I have given this simile again and again which is very good and apt. That these two powers within us - one on the left and one on the right-hand side are there and we are conscious of them and we use them. Out of them the right we use it in absolute awareness. Left one we know is used as subconscious mind and sometimes if you take drugs or use something like that, then you go to your subconscious also. So you can become aware of the subconscious area also.

So you become - you are aware of the right-hand side already and you are aware of the subconscious sometimes when you try to get aware of it. So these two powers that are within us are all the time vibrating in a way. And the points at which they meet, they create the throb. So you can say the centre. The centre is created, a deity is created. But there is no light for us to see or to feel or to be conscious of the deity itself. Deities are fast asleep.

When the Kundalini rises - Kundalini is the subconscious. You will be surprised that Kundalini is the Mahakali power. She is absolutely pure, in the purest form. Because she is not heat(?). Because you can say part of the [UNCLEAR/kidneys] within us, part of the subconscious - sort of we have kept some water separately. Which we have not used so far. So, first of all, we use the subconscious water and the preconscious water. And by...we dirty it.

Then this stored up power rises and does the last cleansing. But when she rises, she creates a third current. Still, that third current, when she rises doesn’t have the light. But when she reaches the Sahasrara and pierces it, then it becomes one with the Universal Consciousness. Because what is God? Is the one who controls the Universal Consciousness. He is the controller of the Universal Consciousness. He emits the light. And when this Kundalini rises, it gets that [UNCLEAR] on it.

Now all the deities get awakened. Now, you may say that it is in the heart, Mataji, you are saying; you are saying it is here. Is confusion you can say. But actually, it is all-pervading faith you can say - God is the nucleus in the factory. It has the light all over and is reflected in the heart. So when your Kundalini, a particular individual Kundalini touches that, then this light is emitted. Then the heart, in the heart the Spirit is ignited. Or sort of it manifests, it projects. And its projections are these vibrations.

So through this, you know the will of God. Through this, you have a dialogue with Him and you understand what He wants. And what does He want you to know? There are three qualities of God which you can feel through this. One, what is the Truth. You ask any question. If you are asking for something and if it is yes, then you get too many vibrations. If it is no, vibrations will lower down. That is how you can verify what is right and what is wrong. What is the truth, what is not the truth.

Now you can know. Nobody has to tell you. You don’t need the clergyman or anybody to certify - is there, through your vibrations - you can feel it; this is the truth or not. Is it the correct place you have come to or the wrong one?

There is also various combinations and permutations of the diseases. It is true but still, there’s a little point which is wrong with you. For example, if you say that Christ was resurrected in person - yes, it is true. You will get more vibrations. But if you feel now, that if you say, “Is it Mataji, the Mother of Christ?”, if you do not accept it - you will not get it any further. [UNCLEAR].

That is how you understand the truth. Now once you understand the truth and if you are identified with it - it is a very difficult thing for the mind; the Western mind as far as I know. Immediately what you get is the second quality of God is joy. The second quality of the Unconscious is joy. You should hear some of the letters that people write to Me. [UNCLEAR].

For Indians, it is very easy to recognise Me. You see, because they do not see only a side, they know Me throughout, you see. Immediately they know the One who raises the Kundalini, One when they fall at My feet and the Kundalini rises, finished. That’s the sign. No problem. For them no problem. So they accept it very fast.

But in these ego-oriented societies, it is very difficult. So they do not accept. The problems are there. But once if you start identifying with the truth and start accepting. Just think you are sitting before Me and who am I? Just think of that. Who am I sitting down before? Just say “I am that”. Then see the joy. See the waves of joy just [UNCLEAR].

But this truth is not easily identified. If it is identified, then you get the second thing which is known as joy. Now the third quality of joy is attention. Means that He is attention. Can you understand that? In English, it is very difficult. But what I am saying is, wherever He is, He is attention. Now how do you explain it? For example, I am sitting down here. I am not paying any attention to him, but I am attention. It flows.

Like the water. You put it somewhere. Wherever there is a lowward area, it will flow there. Water doesn’t do it. Its nature is such that it flows through that. In the same way, I am not paying conscious attention. But if you pray to Me, it will happen.

But you should receive My attention in the sense that My attention should penetrate into your [UNCLEAR/self first]. If you are false, it will not act. Because it understands. The attention understands everything that you are. It is like a computer. Even faster than that.

Supposing My hand is here. And you prick Me with a pin. Immediately My hand will go away like that. Immediately. Even before you have pricked Me, My hand will - if I see. If My attention is on My hand, all the muscles will act and take it away - immediately, from there. In the same way, you can say, much bigger than that is the attention of God. And it starts acting through you. Anybody you want to think of, you just think of - and it acts.

It spreads. It spreads. You can attend to your relations. You can think about your mother, you can think about your father; you can attend to that. Then you rise like this. Then you grow higher and higher and higher. Then the whole personality becomes nothing but attention.

Is the same thing. Is the same thing expressed in three ways. Is the same thing. That when your attention is everywhere, you are joy. Because your attention will receive the joy, because you are Truth, that’s why you are joy, because nothing but Truth can give you joy. Falsehood can never give you joy.

For the time being, you will be happy or unhappy. But joy is a thing which never changes its quality. It's not a duality, it's one. Many people say like this, “I am very happy”. That’s not the joy. It is joy. It cannot be described. Just think supposing I am that. Because for Me, still “I am a supposing”. Just think of that. If so, [UNCLEAR].

If acting in you, it's excited in you. It's the ocean of Truth, Joy and Attention. And you get that. The way you are joyous, I am also joyous. The way you are standing on the Truth, I am also standing on the Truth. The way you are paying attention, I am also paying attention.

You just [UNCLEAR] take somebody's name. Immediately you will get the indication on the hand. Without attention, it is not coming there. But the attention you are not conscious of it. It just works. Because God is giving you his Attention Himself. He pays attention to everything. You are talking to somebody, “Oh, I just thought it”. Why? “Because that has got this trouble”. Immediately God indicates - why? Because He is so attentive.

These are the three qualities of God which have manifested and that is the nature of the Unconscious within us. Now it is for us to rise. First of all, to know the truth. Now rationally you know. Rationally you know that there is something about Mataji, definitely, there is. But emotionally you cannot integrate. Some people know Me emotionally but rationally they cannot integrate.

Try to integrate more. Start thinking by your heart and loving by your brain. Then it acts. Tell your brain to think of all the ways of loving. How do you express your love to someone in words? Start off. Just say a few words. Just now he said something - “Hail Mary’s Grace”. From here and here and here, it just started going. Only that “Hail” itself is a great [UNCLEAR]. See now, only this word - how much vibrations.

It's so simple. Nothing so complicated as the psychologists make. Absolutely it is very simple. But when the Kundalini rises she does the simple job. She is kept there for that. She knows the job. She is aware. She knows Me very well. Of course, she is kept there only for this when you have to meet Me.  She works it out. And she is wondering what’s wrong with these children. Why don’t they understand?

This is the nature of the Unconscious. That is why we say it is unconscious because we are not conscious of it. But not with you people anymore. You are conscious of it. You are conscious of it. Not only that but you know all the things. What is this, what are all the fingers.

Now think of it from God’s point of view. It's all right from a human point of view, you always [UNCLEAR] - but think from His point of view. He wants to evolve you people. To a higher state. You must realise with all your intelligence that still you have not reached that point from where you can say it is completed now. You have not met that power which is described - “Let it be” - and it happens. So there is something transition is still there, you have to achieve that point. That is true? All right.

That means you are still unconscious of some things that you have not known so far. You have to evolve. Now, what is the God’s position? Supposing He has been evolving you throughout. Now at this stage when He has given you all the freedom, and like madcaps, you are trying to do something trivial. For example, a mother who allows her child to be free and the child is trying to put the fingers in the socket. She just has to come and tell, “No, don’t do that. That will give you burns”. She has to tell.

God has to tell you. And how is He going to tell you? He has to have a mouth. He has to learn English. He has to talk to you. He has to have hands like this. Then, otherwise how is He is going to tell? The human mind has so fallen that they think that if you are helped monetarily, “Oh, God is with me”. Is he your servant that he is in your pocket? “Oh, God was very kind to me. Yesterday I went there, He was very kind to me”.

But how do you say it was God or what has helped you? How do you know? Everybody thinks God is their servant standing at the door. “Oh God, do this thing for me, give job to me, please give job to another person. Oh God, will look after me. Give me food, everything. Oh God, let us win the war against this and do this and protect”. All sorts of things are done in the name of God. But whether the gentleman is there or not is not known.

So the gentleman has to take a face and a mouth to talk to you. To tell you about these subtleties. They are subtle but not difficult. They are spiritual. But when He takes the body, it’s a big dilemma for Him. He takes the body, people say, “How can it be?”. First of all, they do not believe in themselves that they can face. That He can come. First of all. They themselves are suffering from an inferiority complex. And they cannot think how can He be a human being just like us.

But if He is clever enough, He can make a drama out of it. He can copy you better than you can copy God. That is what human beings cannot understand. That He can do everything, all types of things and whatever you are doing also is done through His help. But depends on His attention you see.

Just now His attention is on one thing. Throughout the world, He wants in the humans awakening. Sahaja Yoga to be established. First of all, let people feel the vibrations. Otherwise, what am I going to talk to them and what are you going to do with that? So this is the only attention working now. There is no miracle, nothing. Have your realisation first of all.

No resurrections, no crucifixion, nothing any more. You just have, all of you, your vibrations. Correct them. That’s all. You keep the light ready. And that’s how you enlighten the light. Now you may say, “In His light, why should we enlighten our part?”. His light (is) for Himself.

You see, a potter who makes pots makes small little lights also, lamps. He makes lamps. He is light Himself but He makes lamps. Small, small lamps. Then He fills with wick, oil. Then He picks a wick of Kundalini. Then He fills it. When such light fills His heart, gets reflected. He wants to see His reflection.
