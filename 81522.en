Were you going to say something, John?

Well, yeah. She would often, as I was saying, completely spoil us, but there'd be the other extreme where we'd be completely blasted because the negativity would try to act through us, as we were around Shri Mataji all the time. And seeing Shri Mataji in a furyâ€”that's the strongest I've ever felt the vibrations. She would just get everybody together and, one by one, she'd go into that person. But the vibrations were so incredibly powerful. I've never felt vibrations like it when Shri Mataji has been angry. When she was angry with someone else, just being in the room was so powerful.

But she was actually giving her blessings, really. Sometimes she'd have you on the run for days, even weeks, and it would lead up to one almighty big blasting. But it was all her compassion, a compassion that I don't think we as human beings could ever understand.
