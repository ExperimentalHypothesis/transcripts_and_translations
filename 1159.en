Mahavira Puja. Perth (Australia), 28 March 1991.

Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahavira.Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumana, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Pingala Nadi and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.So, Mahavira had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It’s a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nadis, and these seven nadis are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now, these seven nadis that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation.So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know, are only triggered by the entities that appear from the left side. For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble and suddenly he’s attacked from the left side, specially Mooladhara, or any left side, Left Nabhi, because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected with the left side, Ida Nadi, and the right side, Pingala Nadi, is connected with Swadishthana.

So the problems of Mooladhara are really beyond the reach of human beings, and when it is attacked, any one of these chakras on the left-hand side, then psychosomatic diseases occur into human beings. As I have told you many-a-times, [Shri Mataji represents a chakra with both hands] now this is the center, this is the another center, left and right, they are on top of each other. And using the right side too much, goes up to a point and suddenly something happens on the left, triggers. So all diseases, say even diabetes, is due to the psychosomatic effect.A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much, very right-sided, suddenly something happens, maybe also he might inherit that diabetes because of the past, and it triggers and you get this psychosomatic problem. Now this psychosomatic problem is only cured if you know what’s the problem of the left side is. So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side. Why I said it’s difficult the left side is, because when you start moving on the left side the movement becomes linear of course, but it moves downward, while the movement on the right side moves upward.

So the movement goes down like that, and then it coils up, forms coils, and you go on moving with it so you are lost in the coil. But the other one moves upward and the coils are not so many, and because it is upward it’s easy to get out of it. So those people who go to the left, by any chance, by thinking too much about their past, crying about themselves and always complaining, are more difficult than the people on the right side. But the right side people are troublesome to others, while the left side people are troublesome to themselves. That’s how this left side was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.So He has mentioned practically, in details, lots of things that can happen to a person who goes to the left side. He gave the idea of Hell. He also described seven types of Hell. I mean it’s so horrible that I don’t want to tell you what is Hell is, horrifyingly cruel, horrifyingly joyless and horrifyingly so repulsive that you hate yourself when you understand you have committed this mistake, you have committed this pap, this sin; and then what is the result? What you get is the punishment part.Mahavira worked it out everything, He has given in all details what sort of punishment is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided. Also, He has given about the person who is right-sided, but not to that extent because He had to deal with the combination, but mostly with the left side.

As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe, that there is a soul that is made out of the causal bodies of all the five elements. The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance. So this soul which is made of the five causal bodies and your centers, plus we can say, also it has got the control over the parasympathetic, it sits on the spinal cord from outside and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. So it has a connection with every center. Now this is the soul when we die, with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky and it is the soul that guides now the movement of our being, whatever is left now into a new being and that’s how it works out. So everything that we have done so far is recorded in that soul. When you were asking Me, “Mother, we see some sort of round, round things, you see, lying together. What is that?” I told you this is our, this is a dead soul. And now they have found out what I have told them. Because, you see, when a person dies his soul shows you – like even now you can see, round, round things: there could be many, there could be one, a string – and they saw it under a microscope when I told them, that the soul within us is reflected on the cell, which is the reflector of every cell.So the part of the cell which is the reflector, which is placed on one side of the cell also has this soul reflected, and the main soul which is on the back controls that reflected soul which looks after every cell. Now they have found out that there is in that reflector this kind of seven loops, seven loops because it sits on the eight – seven chakras and the Mooladhara. Now what He found out that, when people die then some of the souls are born again just after few days, and these people are just very ordinary type of people, that’s how He brought in a kind of category.So they are – the people who have died – they are of a category, one category, where they exist for a very short time in the collective subconscious and then they take their rebirth. They are very ordinary people, aimless, useless people. But there are some souls when they die, they just hang in the air and they are just waiting to find out somebody who will fulfill their desires which are not yet fulfilled. Like there’s a drunkard and a drunkard, can join another human being who’s living, who would like to drink. So once he starts getting this... So once it starts getting into the habit of drinking, some of these souls can just jump on that person, and when they jump on that person they can make him a real drunkard. I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person, came from Cuba, in America when I went first, and she told Me that she’s very sick of herself. And her husband told Me that she can take one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes. Looked at her, such a little thing. I said “How can she do it?” So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro standing behind her.So I said, “Do you know some Negro?” Immediately she jumped on Me. She said, “Mother, You see that one? You see that one, that’s the one drinks, not me.” Of course I cured her and after that she gave up drinking completely.So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way, you lose complete control of yourself and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you. And when it controls you, you do not know how to get rid of any habit. That’s why it’s difficult to get rid of habits. Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens that these spirits, these dead spirits leave you and you become all right and you give up. That’s how it works. I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell, nor did He find out all these things, because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don’t know why.But what he has talked about is the hell and He has said that if you do this kind of a thing in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you’ll get? And He has described the hell in a very, I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner. And it’s really horrible to know that a human being who thinks well of himself, ultimately will get to that kind of a hell and some are permanently doomed to be there.

But, as incarnations take birth, also these devils, some of them who are completely doomed to live in Hell, also take their birth. And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us. And they can take their birth, as you know, as our gurus and things and everything is happening now, we find it how these people are taking their birth and how they’re misleading us, how they are using the left Swadishthana, or you can call it the left side, just to immobilize us completely.So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen, a person gets possessed, he cannot feel vibrations, there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person. But in Sahaja Yoga, what do we do is to take the name of Mahavira because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi and comes and stays here onto the, we can say, the point which is called our superego. And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses and does all that is required to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga. So we have to be really very thankful to him for doing this kind of work, which is very filthy and dirtybecause these people don’t mind even sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say, or sitting with everything and meditating. They can do anything. They are very dirty people, absolutely dirty. When they become tantricas, they try all kinds of dirty things and, with that, they actually create a problem between themselves and the God.Say, they’ll go to a temple of a Goddess and start misbehaving with a woman there, so the Goddess will disappear. And once the Goddess disappears in that area, they call all these bhoots from the left side.So now we have all these souls which are lying - hanging in the air trying to come back to a conscious thing and to possess someone. Plus these, we have these masters of the left side, who know how to catch hold of these people and put them on somebody or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else. So it’s a continuous process and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

Now, when we know all this, still we get caught up on the left side. Sahaja Yogis do get caught up. That’s why, I think, this Mahavira Jayanti is a very, very great thing for us to observe.Now, why was He called Mahavira? Because only a person like Him – "Vira" means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous, because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rakshasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us.Now, as you know, we use left side very much for so many negativity that is torturing us. But if there is no help, say, from Mahavira, we cannot do it. You call the name of Mahavira – you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name, but Mahavira because He was a human being. All this works out because of Him and He’s such a great identity. He Himself took a birth as a human being, difficult for saints to take birth as human being.Morover, you see, the whole concept of Hell and all that is described in any scripture is a fact, it exists and, if you try to go in there, you see, when I try to go there and to find out, I just go off to sleep, sort of thing. In my sleep I find out all the things that are happening about a person, how much he’s caught up, what he’s done. It’s a not an easy thing to do with the conscious mind. You have to take to the subconscious and you have to go into "sushupti" in a deeper sleep to see what’s happening in the left side. It’s a very funny situation I think and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise. But one should get rid of the problems of the left side with the help of Mahavira.

When this chakra is caught up [Shri Mataji shows Her superego], what you find is a big lump of bhoot coming out of the right side [of the brain], so you have take the name of Mahavira just to remove that pressure from the left side.Now many people do not even know why they suffer. Why should they suffer, when they have done nothing wrong? Because they are possessed. Now even the viruses and all these things like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer, all, I would say, the incurable diseases are there because we are triggered into the left side. That’s why we are suffering from these diseases which are not curable.So we have to thank really very much Mahavira, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also. Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahavira is only fond of light. He doesn’t like darkness. And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there – a lot of it.

So He’s working it out, everywhere, and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases also, we can work it out with candle-light and all that, with three candles we can do this treatment.So you have to be very thankful to Him that He has achieved this kind of entry into the left side and has found out for us what sort of problems exist on left side.

It’s such a nice thing that we have got today, the chance to celebrate His birthday here in a place which is really very much loved by Him.Now, you may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen as a person who is naked. So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate and to find out about the left side and, when he got up, you see, He got caught up in one of the bushes and He had to torn off half part of that. When that half part was torn off, then, as He came out of those bushes and He was all right, but, at the same time, Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene as a little boy from a village and He said that “I’m a poor man.” This little boy said, “I’m a poor person. I’ve nothing with me. You’re a king. You can always get your clothes. Why don’t you give me your – this half cloth that you have?” And they say so that it was given to this boy and He ran away. He was nobody else, but Shri Vishnu. And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth and He hardly for about two seconds or three seconds because He was a king, you see, and He hid Himself with leaves and went to his palace and got dressed.But imagine the people, how negative they are. They just walk without clothes, Jainis. They have, you see, all kinds of taboos against all the worms, everything. It’s said -these people have started- that if you do not respect these little, little animals, like, you can say a, even serpent or any animal which is troublesome and bad, but is a living thing, so it’s to be preserved. Now these Jains are mad. I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism, that they try to save even the bugs, put the bugs in a hut and the hut has got a Brahmin there. Now these bugs suck the blood of this Brahmin and once the Brahmin is completely, I mean I should say, sucked in by these bugs, they fall on the ground. Then they allow the Brahmin to come out and they give him a lot of dakshina – means they give him money as a reward for helping the bugs to suck his blood. This kind of vegetarianism is there.Beware of vegetarians. You see, even Hitler was a vegetarian, so you can imagine what sort of vegetarianism it is. All these fads of vegetarianism and all that are not at all required and that’s what Mahavira showed in his life, that it is not at all important to bother about food, what they should eat. See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people that we should give up vegetarianism completely. Now, also see the juxtaposition of what he wanted to do. If you do not eat proteins, you cannot fight bhoots. A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins, not carbohydrates, but proteins, so that it can fight those left-sided enemies. But here it is, they have to be vegetarians. Now imagine, they have left-sided enemies within them and they want to be vegetarians. Finished. How will they fight it?So all, this is all we should say, is preplanned by the person who tries to sort of is – you can say like this, that, you see, a person, who tries to remove the – or we can say that the person who tries to make these lower animals live, rather than human beings, you see, they’re oppressors, this is the stupid thing they do.Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms and to these fishes or even to chickens. We require human beings. So all this has happened because of human beings going in juxtaposition of whatever is said. Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,” and I’ve yet to come across a Christian who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes, whether it’s a woman or a man. So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught. In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira, what He tried to do was absolutely killed by these people who are trying to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.Also another thing was that this vegetarianism came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna. He was to be married. In those days they were married, not only but they were eating all kinds of meats and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man so he felt that – uparati we call it, this: he didn’t like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that. With that frustration what did he do? He said, “I will not eat meat.” And that’s how vegetarianism started among Jainies. And that’s how it’s still going on, and these Jainies I find are the joyless people, absolutely joyless. They’re so much fond of money, they run after the money and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way that you can’t understand, I mean they are human beings but the way they behave you can’t understand them, they’re not normal people.So we realize that despite all that Mahavira worked out, still the people are supposed to be His disciples, they are Jains, and they are like this.

So what we have to do now, is to understand that in Sahaja Yoga we’d better not do something of that kind. Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so. You know the modus operandi. You know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga. You know the whole subject, so it’s not proper for you to, in any way, to succumb to any such arguments or any such big-big talks or big-big advertisement and take to something that is wrong. It’s very important. We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.Of course, I always say that Westerners, for example, maybe Australians also, should take more to carbohydrates because they eat lot of meat, so they can take to carbohydrates, but that doesn’t mean vegetarianism by any chance. I mean, to compensate. And in India, I always say, they must take to more meats. It’s good for them. But then, by no means, I say that you just eat meat and nothing else, but a balance has to be found out and once you strike it, then you’ll be surprised that you feel so relaxed, so much better, so much enlightened and the vibrations will flow much better than normal.So for food, you have to be careful.Same about with clothes. You shouldn’t go mad after a suit all the time, whether it’s hot or cold or indifferent. What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you. Now, for example, in a climate like this, you may require a suit or something to cover yourself, but supposing you are in Ganapatipule or some place like that where it’s not so cold, not so hot, maybe it’s dry. So what sort of dress you should wear which is comfortable? That should be found out and whatever you find out, like this is such a comfortable dress for us, you’d better do it. Because what I have seen in many – you see, it’s a thing that, whenever I tell you something, don’t take it to the extremes and don’t take a little bit of it. But when I tell you this thing, you must understand that whatever is good for you, whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude, you have to take something that will nourish that, that will improve you and give you a balance.So, to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira, you must think also of Shri Hanuman. Both these things are important.It’s not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture, but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj and you must have seen to it that how important He is and what an important role He plays.

So may God bless you.

Just thinking about Mahavira, I just – it’s impossible to keep into the conscious mind, it’s just going into the left all the time because I just in the car thought that I’d better think about Mahavira. And since then, it’s all going towards the left. It’s so difficult, but it will work out.

May God bless you!

I'll have some water. Terrible thing this left side.Pani? [Water?]

I think if you have any problems, you must ask me also because this is the only time when we can talk about things. If you have any problems, you can ask Me about left side, how to correct it, how to work it out, anything. please ask Me. Because you always get this problem.Sahaja Yogi: [inaudible]Shri Mataji : What’s this? I can't hear him.Sahaja Yogi: Mother, the left Atma, he feels like needles[Shri Mataji asks confirmation in Hindi.]Shri Mataji : Now, heart, as I told you, is the reflection of God Almighty which is the Spirit. So we have two types of heart troubles, as I told you before also. One is when you have an over-active life, right-sided, and the left-sided is the lethargic heart, where you get angina and all that. Now, in your case, your case where you feel there’s something pricking you, that means it’s a possession. If the hands are sort of pins and needles, then it’s a kind of possession. But it can be cleared out....

Any other question?

Sahaja Yogini: Could you say something about Left Nabhi?Shri Mataji : That’s a different area though. Left Nabhi comes from the relationship between a wife and a husband mostly. But a wife who is a complaining type, is very sort of a -all the time grudging, very nervous and bothers the husband, frighten and all sorts of things that they do. You see, just sometimes they do it just to trouble the husband, but sometimes basically they are very left-sided, possessed women. And these possessed women give you this Left Nabhi.Any woman who feels the Left Nabhi, she must immediately understand that there’s some sort of a horrible thing in her being which has to go out. So, for Left Nabhi, you must take to the three-candle treatment and try to respect your husband, try to be kind to him because these spirits can also dominate. You know, not that they can make you very sly, they can also dominate. They have a way of dominating. So, in any case, it looks as if a woman might look to be right-sided, but actually she’s suffering from Left Nabhi and she’s extremely dominating. In the same way, if the husband is not a good man and he tortures the wife and she feels unhappy about it and she’s sorry about it, then also she catches the Left Nabhi.So, in both cases one has to understand that you get your joy, the source of joy is your Self, your own Spirit. It doesn’t depend on your husband or anyone, you are single that way.So, you shouldn’t worry about your husband. You shouldn’t think how he treats you. You shouldn’t bother at all about him. But what you have to think is that: “After all, I’m his wife. I should support him. I should help him. Whatever way he is, let it be as he is because he won’t get corrected if enough I tell him. The best thing is I'd better not tell him anything. Let him do whatever he likes.” And you clear out your Left Nabhi with candle. That’s the way.

Shri Mataji: Pani? [Water?] All right, we'll get the children to wash my feet now.Sahaja Yogi: Children can you please come forward?Shri Mataji : It’s difficult, left side is still there. I'm just- [One boy gives flowers to Shri Mataji]Hello, hum. You are all to come here, wash my feet, alright? So beautiful.Who knows all the Ganesh Stuti to be sang?Or you know Atarva Shirsha?[Indian pujari doesn't know Ganesh Stuti]Ok, better then sing Atarva Shirsha.Because Ganesha is the one, you see, who’s sitting on Mooladhara and it is He who is the one who puts you onto the left side. He throws you all the time and it is Mahavira who tries to save you and to correct you. So there are two forces working.

Every kinds of curse can be removed, family or anything.20:06It’s for a teenage girl, you see, this one! It’s so beautiful. ... Give it more to the children there. Take all the chana. They’re the Realized souls now. ...22:33You wanted Me to talk about children and all that, is it, here? Should I say some few words? Everywhere I have to say – all right!24:31

TALK AFTER MAHAVIRA PUJASo now we have talked about Bhairava, and we have seen how negativity acts within us and how we get caught up. So, I would say that we must always keep in mind that we have a soul, and that soul can be attacked. It has been already attacked when, with all the kind of things we have had in these modern lives, it’s already under attack. But now we have to cleanse it, and put it right. If you really want to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and cleanse yourself, then you have to understand that we need lot of introspection, lot of introspection.Now the people who are left-sided are sort of, they are not straightforward, and they are sly and they talk ill about others. Last time I discovered that in Perth there was a lot of things people were talking, and I wanted to remind you again that I heard about it; also that even now in Australia that kind of people are still there who just start at the back saying things. One person says something, another listens to it and it’s very, very bad thing; because talking ill about others means you first of all get the ill within you. The second is that the way you propagate, you stop Divinity spreading out. Thirdly, you grow into negativity yourself and to whomsoever you talk, that person also gets infected. It’s like a disease.So, I think in Australia throughout we have to be very careful because we have had two big somersaults, you can say, with big falling, because of this only. That secretly – and this is a side, I would say, Australia is very left-sided, otherwise also because of Ganesha’s place. That’s why Ganesha was placed here, to save you and to put you right as far as the left side is concerned. And we have to be very cautious because that temperament develops, you know, depend on. Like also it is in England quite a lot, but say not in America, say not in Austria, not in Russia, Germany: they are on the contrary, open and they can be aggressive, but they are not sly.So either you are aggressive or you are sly. Accordingly you must find out within yourself what’s wrong with you, and where are we wrong. Because after all we are Sahaja Yogis, it’s a great chance we have got that we have got our Realization, and that now we have reached a stage where we really are placed in the Kingdom of God. But now how far you go into it depends only on you.Now Russia – why we were successful, because people are very introspective. If you read any book of Russian writers like Tolstoy or anyone, anything they do, say even when they fall in love or anything, immediately they start introspecting: “Why, why am I falling in love? Why this happening to me? Why I’m thinking like that? Why I’m doing like that?” You see, they introspect, and that introspection if we do not have within ourselves, then what happens that we can go either to the right or to the left.But in this country I see it’s more the left side: sly things are there. Now how all this has happened that we had some horrible leaders, agreed, and instead of talking about it or telling Me about it, they all just started talking among themselves and all that. And they got all their bad qualities sort of combined within themselves, and that’s how so many lost their vibrations and lost their – what should I say, the, the searching power.So, when you see a person or anyone who is doing wrong, better is to forget about it. Or if you don’t forget, then you should write to Me. Even if you don’t do that, better go and talk to that person on his face that: “I think this is not right.” But if you write to Me it can be solved, the problem can be solved. Say now, you have one Mr X as your leader or anybody here who is coming say, from New Zealand, or someone from outside. Immediately you should find out, are you critical of him? What are you looking at that person? What are you trying to find out about that person? If you are critical, then know that you can never progress. You should be critical about yourself, not about others. Know that you are most imperfect, that’s the best way.Like we had a child about nine year old, and he was extremely sly type and he was talking ill like this of this person to that person, and he would go and just jump onto someone, and hit someone – secretly, not openly.So I called the child and I asked him: “What do you think of yourself? Do you think you are the most perfect person?”He said: “Yes, I do.”I said: “That’s it. It’s finished.” Such a person cannot improve.So when you try to find faults with others, know that we have too many faults ourselves. Not to feel guilty – of course, that point is there also. You should never feel guilty about it. If you have faults, just see, “What faults do I have? How will I correct? What chakras I am catching?” Instead of seeing the chakras of others if you see your own, then you’ll become purified, you’ll be very clean, you’ll be wonderful; everything will be fine. But if you cannot see your own faults, that means you haven’t yet got your Self-realization. “Self-realization” means to know about your Self, and this – the last time I did say all these things here in Perth and also otherwise, that if you talk about somebody like that to spread stories. Ladies specially should be careful because they are on the left, they have to be very, very careful, that they start judging others. They think they are perfect, they judge, they tell their husband, then husband tells another husband, then husband tells his wife – it spreads. You have to be extremely wise and sensible women. If you are not sensible this will spread like a disease. In Sahaja Yoga this is one of the diseases I dread, is what Christ has called “murmuring souls.” He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls.”Leaders are also afraid to tell you something. If they tell you something, immediately you’ll start saying, “Oh, Mother said so – he’s saying so.” Whatever the leader is saying you must listen to him, must obey him, ask him what, what does he mean by saying this, what is it? Now in case you find something wrong with the leader you are all free to write to Me, and I will definitely go into it. For example, Stephen wrote to Me about someone and I went into this, enquired and found out what was the thing. See, so there’s no harm in finding out about someone. Some lady wrote to Me also and I found it. So, but unnecessarily paying attention to another person is not a good thing. Paying attention to your Self and looking all the good points of another person, of helping another person, that’s how we would be collective, we’ll be growing faster and we’ll be enjoying ourselves.

Now our children are here. Now what I find, that we do not know really what are the balanced ways of looking after children. So, some think that when I said they are Realized souls, so they said, “All right, let them do what they like.” It’s not true – otherwise if that is so they would have been born out of the trees, you see! Why are they born out of you? So you have a responsibility, whether they are Realized or not. You have a responsibility about your children, and you have to see that you correct them. It’s very important.Some people, I’ve seen, allow their children to go just so mad and so, they go so amok. In this I would say an Indian parent is an ideal parent. What he will do, he looks after the child. Also in a way, he loves, expresses his love and all that. But if he finds anything wrong with the child, immediately he’ll correct – immediately, not spare him, in the presence of others. Now, if another person comes and tells about the child that this child has done, immediately he will scold the child. He will never get angry with the another person: “Why did you say about my child now?” but thank him that “Thank God you have told me”; because he might be spoilt more.Like I’ll tell you, we had one Avadhut – now he’s a grown-up boy, but when he was young – one day he asked Me that “If you leave your parents, the badhas of your parents, they leave you or not?”I said, “No, they may not leave, the badhas of your parents.”“Then what’s the use of leaving the parents?”“But,” I said, “who is leaving parents?”“No,” he said, “I heard that in the Western countries people- children leave their parents when they are eighteen years of age. But I would not like to leave the parents.”I said, “Why? You can be free.”He said, “Then I’ll be free to do wrong. Who will correct me? If I take the cigarette in my hand, who will correct me? Who will tell me, ‘Don’t do it’?”I mean, if a child takes a cigarette in the hand, immediately the father will take the cigarette and burn it, also. “And next time I see you, I’ll burn your tongue.” Finished.But the child knows that “The father loves me, and loves me in such a way that I should not lose my father.” But he must know that he can lose the kindness of the father. If you allow the child just all the time to behave the way he likes, or it likes, then it will sit on your head.And today only I was discussing with him, and I told him that I was traveling one day with one lady in the train, one of the Sahaja Yoginis, and her child was there, not very old, must have been about seven years of age. She was trying to talk to Me and this fellow was all the time, “Mummy, Mummy” and then, “Why? Why?” was going on, you see, all the time.I told her, “Why must you answer all his questions?”She said, “He is just making enquiries.”I said, “Nothing sensible enquiries, just it’s nonsense. He wants to attract your attention. So why do you want to pay so much attention to him?”So she said, “Mother, how to stop it?”I said, “I’ll stop it in one minute.”I said, I asked him, “You should not ask so many questions.”So he said, “Why?”“Because,” I said, “you are stupid. You have to learn a lot still, and if you go on asking question like this you’ll be very, very stupid and one day you’ll have to go like a madman. Do you want to become a madman?” He got the fright of his life. “You’ll become mad.”And you see, if any of your children are there, you have to tell them some stories. I’ll tell you how. Some children have a habit of beating others or doing something; then you said, “Now if you beat, then a tail comes out of your bottom like that, you see, like a doggy” and something like that. And they believe it! They believe it.Next day they’ll ask, “Is there a tail coming out?”[Laughter]“Yeah, maybe, maybe. So now, you are going to behave?”“Yeah. I’ll be very ... ”You see, all these tricks have to be played to your children. But they’re very clever and they know how to make you dance, you see, how to make you their sort of slave sometimes, you know: for everything they will demand “do this, do this.” Now because they’re Realized souls .... I was surprised that when I went to London, you see, I read in the newspaper the statistics about children, that every week in London city only, two children are killed by parents. I mean, that was too much for Me.So I just blasted all of them and I said, “Nothing doing, you must love your children.”As a result all the children sat on their heads, you see, and they couldn’t come to the programs. If they came to the programs they were, the children were to be kept outside like doggies, tied together something; and in England I don’t know, maybe here also, they do have a leash, just like a dog. You see they hold the children just like this. I said, “How cruel it is.” But now I know how children can be in the West. I don’t know it’s white skin or whatever you may say, that first we started a school, you see, for them because there was no school available, they were in a mess. So we said, all right, in Dharamshala we’ll start a school.So we started a school in Dharamshala, and these children were brought because they had no way to go anywhere, so in a hurry it was started, you see. So there must be something also if you just start a school in a great hurry, maybe some things are left out. But these children were terrible because they saw these teachers were Indians, so they came and started punching them, they started showing tongue to them, sometimes spitting at them, sometimes pinching and doing all kinds of things, you know. So the teachers got a fright.

They said, “Baba, we can’t look after these bounders, God knows what they are up to. One day they’ll bring a knife and push it through us. We don’t know what to do.”And we have had very bad experience in Shudy Camp about these children, that they had no sense of proportion, nothing, they were not cautious at all. And then I said, “What will you do?”“They have already started jumping,” they said, “from different places.” (I hope they are not jumping there.) Ah. So ... and one boy broke his leg. They got a fright.So I said, “All right, now you do one thing. They are already spoilt, but take one foot-rule, ruler, and keep it and say that ‘If you misbehave, this is the thing.’ And once or twice just do a little bit like that.” Now that doesn’t mean you go on beating your children. I mean, everything should not be taken to an extreme, but there should be a balance – must understand.So there was one boy who had come as a cook from Austria. And Yogi had asked him – he thought that he is a Westerner – “You’d better look after the children.” He started thrashing them left and right. Not the Indian women. Indian women don’t thrash so much, you see, we don’t beat. I mean, I have slapped My daughter once, one daughter, elder one and younger one twice in their lifetime. We don’t believe in thrashing, but you see they’re afraid of our eyes, even they know what we want, what is good.I’ll tell you, My younger daughter she, when she went to college in Delhi she found all the girls were wearing sleeveless blouses. So she came and asked Me, “Should I wear sleeveless blouses? Because all the girls are wearing sleeveless blouses.”I said, “Go ahead, if you think so.”She said, “Mummy, why don’t You wear sleeveless blouse?”I said, “I feel shy, when I’ve worn it; I don’t like to expose My hands like that. I don’t like it, it’s not good. The arms, you see, should be covered, I think.”Immediately she said, “Then it is no criteria if I say ‘I want this’ and all that, You should say ‘Yes’ to everything – You should have said ‘No, no’ to me. I would have been very happy.”So this wisdom is there in, among Indian children. They like – like Avadut, as I told you, he said that “Then who will correct me, who will stop me from doing wrong?” But that’s not with our children here. So you see, because, I don’t know why, but maybe that our roots are too deep or whatever it is, we are a little controlled all the time. And wisdom is very important. If you tell a child “you have been very unmannerly” – I mean, it’s like saying the horridest thing to a child, “you’re unmannerly.” Or to say “you are very unwise”; then the child feels very hurt, “I’m unwise, I’ve not been seeing.”But the best thing would be to say, “You are Sahaja Yogis, you are special people. You can’t do like that, you are Sahaja Yogis.” All the time go on telling them how dignified they should be, what is expected of a Sahaja Yogi – it is better. But never spoil them. This is one thing you should not do, otherwise it will be a permanent headache for you. Even if they are Realized souls, whatever they may be; but please see that you do not spoil them. That’s very important.Also as I told you, that don’t talk ill of each other on the back. Is a very bad habit. That’s how you’ll catch on bhoots and you’ll become extremely negative. Any such thought comes into your mind, just stop it. Is a very, it’s a very nasty disease, you see, that spreads, so it makes you – I mean, it’s so sickening, you know. When I hear about somebody who talks ill of someone it’s extremely sickening, because it’s not being human. You see, in the animal, there’s one animal called hyena, and they say this hyena is like that. It comes slowly and steals a child or anything, it’s a very sly type of an animal. And such a person we call as hyena in India, such a person is called as a hyena, and is regarded as a very low type of a personality, they talk like this.

In Sahaja Yoga it doesn’t behove. No Sahaja Yogis should talk ill about each other. Nor should they discuss each other. Never! Now somebody does that, you must immediately say: “Now, please, I don’t want to hear. Please don’t tell me. This is not a very good thing.” The politicians do like that, but not Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis should not do because, you see, you are great people, you are Yogis. Do you know how a Yogi becomes a Realized soul, in the normal way?The other day I was reading a book about Upanishadas, and one of them was – today only I saw it in the morning time when I got up. There was written about a Yogi, that you have to really starve yourself, first of all is. Then you have to do shirshasana. With that you have to do pranayama. Then you have to get up four o’clock in the morning and take your bath, and then sit down for dhyana, and for five hours you must sit for your dhyana. After that you have to do pranayama. That’s also special style, it’s not easy for normal person to do that: is till you say sixty you raise your left side, take the prana through your, I mean you breathe through your nostril, left one. Now sixty-four you say, keep it here, and then rechaka: you do the taking it out thirty-two times, can you imagine? This you have to do hundred-and-eight times every day, minimum. This is the minimum. Now there are so many exercises, if I tell you that you’ll be shocked.So, like you have to stand and suddenly jump, and put your both the feet five feet apart –imagine. Then turn round: to clear your nadis, you see, you have to turn round and put yourself on the left side. Now on the left side you put yourself, and it’s quite a big thing that they have described but in short it’s a stretching exercise, and you put your hand on the left side and go down, stretch yourself. Again go back to normal, again jump and go five feet apart. Then put to the right side. Nadi cleansing is this way. But there are so many others described, you see. They are so horrible. He said, ordinary exercises for ordinary people, but for a person who wants to achieve yoga, he has to do all these horrible exercises are, I don’t know. I mean, by that time all your body will be broken, the way it is; or you’ll in any case get moksha, you see! It’s like that.But what I’m trying to tell you is this, that now you’ve got everything simple, easy, this thing. But in a subtle way still all these nonsensical things are sticking on. And even if you are in the boat now, still it is there and they are creating a heavy weight. And this heavy weight can really take you down again; and when you go down after a certain height, you go down very fast. So many people we have thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, so many have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, so many have come into Sahaja Yoga. Now the people who have come in the beginning are excused for some time, and also they see you, how you behave – it’s very important.So first thing we must know that we are people who are Sahaja Yogis, special type of people, specially placed and we have so many privileges, so we have to be extremely dignified. I’ve seen people just will laugh for nothing at all. In a group you are there, they just start laughing. There’s no need to laugh, but they’ll just start laughing. Even if I am sitting they’ll just go on chatting and talking and – see, no sense at all. But if your Guru is sitting there you have to keep quiet, you have to be humble, you have to have awe. All these things are important which we have to gradually learn, because you have never had a proper training about spiritual life. You see, what these churches, or you can say these temples that you have seen, or anything else that you have got those, you see, have not been real masters to tell you how to behave, how to address, how to be there.So now gradually you should see for yourself that you have to grow, and grow very fast. And for that you have to remember we must need our introspection, to see “Where am I? Now what am I doing? Ah, now the anger is coming.” As soon as the anger starts coming, go and stand before your mirror and say, “Now come along, let’s get angry.” You face yourself all the time, and it will help – not the others.Now I have to tell you that whenever you find such people coming up, they will form a group. Then a group can become bigger or absolutely small, depending on you. You have to just say, “Mother has said not to listen a word against anyone” – just not to listen. And in the beginning of course, it is quite a lot has to be tolerated. Like I’ve seen, if you see the letters written to Me in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, they are so maddening. This person talking ill about that, that person talking ill about that; I mean, anybody would be mad to read all that. So I never read them. All these letters I used to just burn away.But luckily now these people have become extremely sensible, they understand their responsibility, they have become very, very beautiful people, very understanding; and the love that they have for each other, it’s very interesting. Only in love you can know about others, not in hatred. If you hate someone how will you know about that person, the beauty of that person? So then you start seeing the beauty of that person and you start enjoying that person. This is what Sahaja Yoga is. So I would like you to see that you train your children in such a manner that they feel their responsibilities as Sahaja Yogis.May God bless you.

Better be on the lookout, there’s smaller children also.And never neglect them; of course, never neglect them. Never leave them alone. Even if you are going, doing a job, you can give it up for the children’s sake, for certain age. Then you can take up when they’re ... There are so many things you can do in the house also for ladies. And also men should understand that they must every day spend some time with their children. This is extremely important; because children are so relaxing.

Look at her, she’s running off. My attention is all there. I hope they don’t ... Are they careful children? Or keep someone there ... Some lady can be alternately with children, one after another, better look after them.

So now, it’s a very nice place we have come to, and I hope this work will be done now. We have done the inauguration and it will be all ready. It would be as they said, would be three storeys. Would be a good idea if it works out, and I don’t know what you are going to do here, what’s going to work out. Did you dig it out for your – is it? ... Fireplace? It’s going to be a fireplace. And what will you have up there, in the gap? ... Another on top? Good. How did you carry it up there? ... Prefabricated.52:54So now what is the next program? Is the lunch, is it? All right ... Somebody’s there. Please look after them. Alternately, you see, can do it.54:54You should finish everything, you know. Don’t leave anything here.58:46It’s too much. Now you eat this one. All right? I can’t have so much of it. It’s a heart here!59:01[Yogini asks about looking after Western teenage children.]59:14What happened? ... Fourteen and fifteen? And they’re not in Sahaja Yoga? ... I think you need to send them to some school in India. ... Not Australian? ... He will allow? Into – it need not be, you see, it need not be a Sahaja school, just not started, but we can put them in a school which is, what you can call it a normal Indian school. One of the admissions you can get them, in a hostel. That will save them. And once we start our high school, they can join us. Because they have to be brought up properly. ... Also, there are so many other temptations, I can tell you. It’s very dangerous. ...You give Me their names. You can get them admitted. Send it to you. And say that these children would like to get admitted into some school there. But the standard in India is very hard. They’ll have to go one year less, but it’s all right; but they’ll have very good education there. Go with her and find out a school. It can be anywhere: in Bombay, Pune, anywhere. That would be cheaper, definitely, than schools here, and they’ll be disciplined. I agree with you ... Nobody’s bothered, you see. Because they trouble the teacher also. And also the government is not bothered. Children are so precocious, they know so many things – it’s horrible, I tell you. It’s difficult to understand such small children knowing things which we did not even know when we were medical students. ... Oh, thank you.Two, three children, or which is the youngest? The youngest is what age? She’s the youngest. What is her age? ... Eleven. Still she’s not very young. Three of them can go. Big for her age, and very good. So he’s very tall, eh? They get taller and taller, eh? What’s your height now? You’re already five-ten, or something? Your father is tall, is he? Yes, that’s right. You’d like to go to India? Good. Nice. You should find out a school. ....1:03:42That’s what they told Me when the children ....1:04:04I won’t be going to India for quite some time, but we could ask Yogi if he can arrange for their admission into some good school. ... What class are you? Eleven. O-level? ... You should finish, I think, in any case. Otherwise you’ll be just ... That is O-level, no? A-level ... So you have done A-level already? You are doing O-level. I think let him finish O-level, is important. Then he goes to college? You can get an admission in college. After one year. In India he goes into a college. He can take up arts or something like that, whatever ... You want to do computer? What do you like? What subjects you have now? Maths, eh? You don’t like maths. Now, what else? Biology? You have biology. You like biology? .... Genetics ....1:07:09All right, we’ll see now for a college for you, whatever he wants to do. Is he good at English? You like to write? You’d like to do journalism? Think about it. Let us know. Journalism is easy in India, if you want to do journalism, it’s easy to do. But even genetics you might find admission – you try. .... Thirteen. Now, what class he is? Yes, he can go to school. ... No, it’s all right. This shawl is quite good.1:07:58By next April will it be ready? I’ll be here! .... Once you teach them, they will do it. And this gets fixed into it, you don’t have to do anything. ....1:08:42Is that cement blocks ...?1:09:04We too have something like this, but they are very weak in India. .... But these can hold two storeys? Really? ....
