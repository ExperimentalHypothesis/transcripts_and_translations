b'\nMahavira Puja. Perth (Australia), 28 March 1991.\n\nToday we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahavira.\nMahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumana, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Pingala Nadi and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.\nSo, Mahavira had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nadis, and these seven nadis are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now, these seven nadis that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation.\nSo all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know, are only triggered by the entities that appear from the left side. For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble and suddenly he\xe2\x80\x99s attacked from the left side, specially Mooladhara, or any left side, Left Nabhi, because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected with the left side, Ida Nadi, and the right side, Pingala Nadi, is connected with Swadisthana.\nSo the problems of Mooladhara are really beyond the reach of human beings, and when it is attacked, any one of these chakras on the left-hand side, then psychosomatic diseases occur into human beings. As I have told you many-a-times, [Shri Mataji represents a chakra with both hands] now this is the center, this is the another center, left and right, they are on top of each other. And using the right side too much, goes up to a point and suddenly something happens on the left, triggers. So all diseases, say even diabetes, is due to the psychosomatic effect.\nA person who is very hard-working, thinks too much, very right-sided, suddenly something happens, maybe also he might inherit that diabetes because of the past, and it triggers and you get this psychosomatic problem. Now this psychosomatic problem is only cured if you know what\xe2\x80\x99s the problem of the left side is. So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side. Why I said it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult the left side is, because when you start moving on the left side the movement becomes linear of course, but it moves downward, while the movement on the right side moves upward.\nSo the movement goes down like that, and then it coils up, forms coils, and you go on moving with it so you are lost in the coil. But the other one moves upward and the coils are not so many, and because it is upward it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get out of it. So those people who go to the left, by any chance, by thinking too much about their past, crying about themselves and always complaining, are more difficult than the people on the right side. But the right side people are troublesome to others, while the left side people are troublesome to themselves. That\xe2\x80\x99s how this left side was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.\nOf course He knew also, I think, all about it.\nSo He has mentioned practically, in details, lots of things that can happen to a person who goes to the left side. He gave the idea of Hell. He also described seven types of Hell. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s so horrible that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell you what is Hell is, horrifyingly cruel, horrifyingly joyless and horrifyingly so repulsive that you hate yourself when you understand you have committed this mistake, you have committed this pap, this sin; and then what is the result? What you get is the punishment part.\nMahavira worked it out everything, He has given in all details what sort of punishment is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided. Also, He has given about the person who is right-sided, but not to that extent because He had to deal with the combination, but mostly with the left side.\nAs I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe, that there is a soul that is made out of the causal bodies of all the five elements. The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance. So this soul which is made of the five causal bodies and your centers, plus we can say, also it has got the control over the parasympathetic, it sits on the spinal cord from outside and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. So it has a connection with every center. Now this is the soul when we die, with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky and it is the soul that guides now the movement of our being, whatever is left now into a new being and that\xe2\x80\x99s how it works out. So everything that we have done so far is recorded in that soul. When you were asking Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we see some sort of round, round things, you see, lying together. What is that?\xe2\x80\x9d I told you this is our, this is a dead soul. And now they have found out what I have told them. Because, you see, when a person dies his soul shows you \xe2\x80\x93 like even now you can see, round, round things: there could be many, there could be one, a string \xe2\x80\x93 and they saw it under a microscope when I told them, that the soul within us is reflected on the cell, which is the reflector of every cell.\nSo the part of the cell which is the reflector, which is placed on one side of the cell also has this soul reflected, and the main soul which is on the back controls that reflected soul which looks after every cell. Now they have found out that there is in that reflector this kind of seven loops, seven loops because it sits on the eight \xe2\x80\x93 seven chakras and the Mooladhara. Now what He found out that, when people die then some of the souls are born again just after few days, and these people are just very ordinary type of people, that\xe2\x80\x99s how He brought in a kind of category.\nSo they are \xe2\x80\x93 the people who have died \xe2\x80\x93 they are of a category, one category, where they exist for a very short time in the collective subconscious and then they take their rebirth. They are very ordinary people, aimless, useless people. But there are some souls when they die, they just hang in the air and they are just waiting to find out somebody who will fulfill their desires which are not yet fulfilled. Like there\xe2\x80\x99s a drunkard and a drunkard, can join another human being who\xe2\x80\x99s living, who would like to drink. So once he starts getting this\xe2\x80\xa6 So once it starts getting into the habit of drinking, some of these souls can just jump on that person, and when they jump on that person they can make him a real drunkard. I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person, came from Cuba, in America when I went first, and she told Me that she\xe2\x80\x99s very sick of herself. And her husband told Me that she can take one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes. Looked at her, such a little thing. I said \xe2\x80\x9cHow can she do it?\xe2\x80\x9d So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro standing behind her.\nSo I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know some Negro?\xe2\x80\x9d Immediately she jumped on Me. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, You see that one? You see that one, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one drinks, not me.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course I cured her and after that she gave up drinking completely.\nSo whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way, you lose complete control of yourself and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you. And when it controls you, you do not know how to get rid of any habit. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get rid of habits. Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens that these spirits, these dead spirits leave you and you become all right and you give up. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it works. I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell, nor did He find out all these things, because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\nBut what he has talked about is the hell and He has said that if you do this kind of a thing in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you\xe2\x80\x99ll get? And He has described the hell in a very, I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner. And it\xe2\x80\x99s really horrible to know that a human being who thinks well of himself, ultimately will get to that kind of a hell and some are permanently doomed to be there.\n\nBut, as incarnations take birth, also these devils, some of them who are completely doomed to live in Hell, also take their birth. And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us. And they can take their birth, as you know, as our gurus and things and everything is happening now, we find it how these people are taking their birth and how they\xe2\x80\x99re misleading us, how they are using the left Swadisthana, or you can call it the left side, just to immobilize us completely.\nSo when a person is possessed, as you must have seen, a person gets possessed, he cannot feel vibrations, there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person. But in Sahaja Yoga, what do we do is to take the name of Mahavira because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi and comes and stays here onto the, we can say, the point which is called our superego. And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses and does all that is required to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga. So we have to be really very thankful to him for doing this kind of work, which is very filthy and dirty\nbecause these people don\xe2\x80\x99t mind even sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say, or sitting with everything and meditating. They can do anything. They are very dirty people, absolutely dirty. When they become tantricas, they try all kinds of dirty things and, with that, they actually create a problem between themselves and the God.\nSay, they\xe2\x80\x99ll go to a temple of a Goddess and start misbehaving with a woman there, so the Goddess will disappear. And once the Goddess disappears in that area, they call all these bhoots from the left side.\nSo now we have all these souls which are lying - hanging in the air trying to come back to a conscious thing and to possess someone. Plus these, we have these masters of the left side, who know how to catch hold of these people and put them on somebody or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a continuous process and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.\nNow, when we know all this, still we get caught up on the left side. Sahaja Yogis do get caught up. That\xe2\x80\x99s why, I think, this Mahavira Jayanti is a very, very great thing for us to observe.\nNow, why was He called Mahavira? Because only a person like Him \xe2\x80\x93 "Vira" means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous, because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rakshasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us.\nNow, as you know, we use left side very much for so many negativity that is torturing us. But if there is no help, say, from Mahavira, we cannot do it. You call the name of Mahavira \xe2\x80\x93 you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name, but Mahavira because He was a human being. All this works out because of Him and He\xe2\x80\x99s such a great identity. He Himself took a birth as a human being, difficult for saints to take birth as human being.\nMorover, you see, the whole concept of Hell and all that is described in any scripture is a fact, it exists and, if you try to go in there, you see, when I try to go there and to find out, I just go off to sleep, sort of thing. In my sleep I find out all the things that are happening about a person, how much he\xe2\x80\x99s caught up, what he\xe2\x80\x99s done. It\xe2\x80\x99s a not an easy thing to do with the conscious mind. You have to take to the subconscious and you have to go into "sushupti" in a deeper sleep to see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the left side. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very funny situation I think and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise. But one should get rid of the problems of the left side with the help of Mahavira.\nWhen this chakra is caught up [Shri Mataji shows Her superego], what you find is a big lump of bhoot coming out of the right side [of the brain], so you have take the name of Mahavira just to remove that pressure from the left side.\nNow many people do not even know why they suffer. Why should they suffer, when they have done nothing wrong? Because they are possessed. Now even the viruses and all these things like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer, all, I would say, the incurable diseases are there because we are triggered into the left side. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are suffering from these diseases which are not curable.\nSo we have to thank really very much Mahavira, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also. Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.\nYou know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahavira is only fond of light. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like darkness. And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there \xe2\x80\x93 a lot of it.\nSo He\xe2\x80\x99s working it out, everywhere, and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases also, we can work it out with candle-light and all that, with three candles we can do this treatment.\nSo you have to be very thankful to Him that He has achieved this kind of entry into the left side and has found out for us what sort of problems exist on left side.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a nice thing that we have got today, the chance to celebrate His birthday here in a place which is really very much loved by Him.\nNow, you may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen as a person who is naked. So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate and to find out about the left side and, when he got up, you see, He got caught up in one of the bushes and He had to torn off half part of that. When that half part was torn off, then, as He came out of those bushes and He was all right, but, at the same time, Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene as a little boy from a village and He said that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a poor man.\xe2\x80\x9d This little boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a poor person. I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing with me. You\xe2\x80\x99re a king. You can always get your clothes. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give me your \xe2\x80\x93 this half cloth that you have?\xe2\x80\x9d And they say so that it was given to this boy and He ran away. He was nobody else, but Shri Vishnu. And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth and He hardly for about two seconds or three seconds because He was a king, you see, and He hid Himself with leaves and went to his palace and got dressed.\nBut imagine the people, how negative they are. They just walk without clothes, Jainis. They have, you see, all kinds of taboos against all the worms, everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s said -these people have started- that if you do not respect these little, little animals, like, you can say a, even serpent or any animal which is troublesome and bad, but is a living thing, so it\xe2\x80\x99s to be preserved. Now these Jains are mad. I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism, that they try to save even the bugs, put the bugs in a hut and the hut has got a Brahmin there. Now these bugs suck the blood of this Brahmin and once the Brahmin is completely, I mean I should say, sucked in by these bugs, they fall on the ground. Then they allow the Brahmin to come out and they give him a lot of dakshina \xe2\x80\x93 means they give him money as a reward for helping the bugs to suck his blood. This kind of vegetarianism is there.\nBeware of vegetarians. You see, even Hitler was a vegetarian, so you can imagine what sort of vegetarianism it is. All these fads of vegetarianism and all that are not at all required and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Mahavira showed in his life, that it is not at all important to bother about food, what they should eat. See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people that we should give up vegetarianism completely. Now, also see the juxtaposition of what he wanted to do. If you do not eat proteins, you cannot fight bhoots. A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins, not carbohydrates, but proteins, so that it can fight those left-sided enemies. But here it is, they have to be vegetarians. Now imagine, they have left-sided enemies within them and they want to be vegetarians. Finished. How will they fight it?\nSo all, this is all we should say, is preplanned by the person who tries to sort of is \xe2\x80\x93 you can say like this, that, you see, a person, who tries to remove the \xe2\x80\x93 or we can say that the person who tries to make these lower animals live, rather than human beings, you see, they\xe2\x80\x99re oppressors, this is the stupid thing they do.\nMust know that I cannot give Realization to these worms and to these fishes or even to chickens. We require human beings. So all this has happened because of human beings going in juxtaposition of whatever is said. Like Christ has said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not have adulterous eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to come across a Christian who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a woman or a man. So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught. In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira, what He tried to do was absolutely killed by these people who are trying to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.\nAlso another thing was that this vegetarianism came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna. He was to be married. In those days they were married, not only but they were eating all kinds of meats and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man so he felt that \xe2\x80\x93 uparati we call it, this: he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that. With that frustration what did he do? He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not eat meat.\xe2\x80\x9d And that\xe2\x80\x99s how vegetarianism started among Jainies. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s still going on, and these Jainies I find are the joyless people, absolutely joyless. They\xe2\x80\x99re so much fond of money, they run after the money and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way that you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, I mean they are human beings but the way they behave you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand them, they\xe2\x80\x99re not normal people.\nSo we realize that despite all that Mahavira worked out, still the people are supposed to be His disciples, they are Jains, and they are like this.\n\nSo what we have to do now, is to understand that in Sahaja Yoga we\xe2\x80\x99d better not do something of that kind. Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so. You know the modus operandi. You know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga. You know the whole subject, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not proper for you to, in any way, to succumb to any such arguments or any such big-big talks or big-big advertisement and take to something that is wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important. We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.\nOf course, I always say that Westerners, for example, maybe Australians also, should take more to carbohydrates because they eat lot of meat, so they can take to carbohydrates, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean vegetarianism by any chance. I mean, to compensate. And in India, I always say, they must take to more meats. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for them. But then, by no means, I say that you just eat meat and nothing else, but a balance has to be found out and once you strike it, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised that you feel so relaxed, so much better, so much enlightened and the vibrations will flow much better than normal.\nSo for food, you have to be careful.\nSame about with clothes. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go mad after a suit all the time, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s hot or cold or indifferent. What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you. Now, for example, in a climate like this, you may require a suit or something to cover yourself, but supposing you are in Ganapatipule or some place like that where it\xe2\x80\x99s not so cold, not so hot, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s dry. So what sort of dress you should wear which is comfortable? That should be found out and whatever you find out, like this is such a comfortable dress for us, you\xe2\x80\x99d better do it. Because what I have seen in many \xe2\x80\x93 you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing that, whenever I tell you something, don\xe2\x80\x99t take it to the extremes and don\xe2\x80\x99t take a little bit of it. But when I tell you this thing, you must understand that whatever is good for you, whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude, you have to take something that will nourish that, that will improve you and give you a balance.\nSo, to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira, you must think also of Shri Hanuman. Both these things are important.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture, but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj and you must have seen to it that how important He is and what an important role He plays.\nSo may God bless you.\nJust thinking about Mahavira, I just \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to keep into the conscious mind, it\xe2\x80\x99s just going into the left all the time because I just in the car thought that I\xe2\x80\x99d better think about Mahavira. And since then, it\xe2\x80\x99s all going towards the left. It\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult, but it will work out.\nMay God bless you!\nI\'ll have some water. Terrible thing this left side.\nPani? [Water?]\nI think if you have any problems, you must ask me also because this is the only time when we can talk about things. If you have any problems, you can ask Me about left side, how to correct it, how to work it out, anything. please ask Me. Because you always get this problem.\nSahaja Yogi: [inaudible]\nShri Mataji : What\xe2\x80\x99s this? I can\'t hear him.\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, the left Atma, he feels like needles\n[Shri Mataji asks confirmation in Hindi.]\nShri Mataji : Now, heart, as I told you, is the reflection of God Almighty which is the Spirit. So we have two types of heart troubles, as I told you before also. One is when you have an over-active life, right-sided, and the left-sided is the lethargic heart, where you get angina and all that. Now, in your case, your case where you feel there\xe2\x80\x99s something pricking you, that means it\xe2\x80\x99s a possession. If the hands are sort of pins and needles, then it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of possession. But it can be cleared out\xe2\x80\xa6.\nAny other question?\nSahaja Yogini: Could you say something about Left Nabhi?\nShri Mataji : That\xe2\x80\x99s a different area though. Left Nabhi comes from the relationship between a wife and a husband mostly. But a wife who is a complaining type, is very sort of a -all the time grudging, very nervous and bothers the husband, frighten and all sorts of things that they do. You see, just sometimes they do it just to trouble the husband, but sometimes basically they are very left-sided, possessed women. And these possessed women give you this Left Nabhi.\nAny woman who feels the Left Nabhi, she must immediately understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of a horrible thing in her being which has to go out. So, for Left Nabhi, you must take to the three-candle treatment and try to respect your husband, try to be kind to him because these spirits can also dominate. You know, not that they can make you very sly, they can also dominate. They have a way of dominating. So, in any case, it looks as if a woman might look to be right-sided, but actually she\xe2\x80\x99s suffering from Left Nabhi and she\xe2\x80\x99s extremely dominating. In the same way, if the husband is not a good man and he tortures the wife and she feels unhappy about it and she\xe2\x80\x99s sorry about it, then also she catches the Left Nabhi.\nSo, in both cases one has to understand that you get your joy, the source of joy is your Self, your own Spirit. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on your husband or anyone, you are single that way.\nSo, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about your husband. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think how he treats you. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother at all about him. But what you have to think is that: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I\xe2\x80\x99m his wife. I should support him. I should help him. Whatever way he is, let it be as he is because he won\xe2\x80\x99t get corrected if enough I tell him. The best thing is I\'d better not tell him anything. Let him do whatever he likes.\xe2\x80\x9d And you clear out your Left Nabhi with candle. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way.\n\nShri Mataji: Pani? [Water?] All right, we\'ll get the children to wash my feet now.\nSahaja Yogi: Children can you please come forward?\nShri Mataji : It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, left side is still there. I\'m just- [One boy gives flowers to Shri Mataji]\nHello, hum. You are all to come here, wash my feet, alright? So beautiful.\nWho knows all the Ganesh Stuti to be sang?\nOr you know Atarva Shirsha?\n[Indian pujari doesn\'t know Ganesh Stuti]\nOk, better then sing Atarva Shirsha.\nBecause Ganesha is the one, you see, who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on Mooladhara and it is He who is the one who puts you onto the left side. He throws you all the time and it is Mahavira who tries to save you and to correct you. So there are two forces working.\n\n[Ganesha Atharva Shirsha begins]\nTake this. He says he has got the names of Bhairavanath, so it\xe2\x80\x99s very good. So you can come and wash My hands, those who are leaders here. Leaders! Big joke about them! Somebody should come here to put all the things. Who can do it? Now, what \xe2\x80\x93 somebody? One by one you can come and put the water in. Just put the water. No, no, not the \xe2\x80\xa6 You have to do it. Now, one by one, come along. First of all is the honey. Call him. Take that one. This other one. \xe2\x80\xa6 We need you again. \xe2\x80\xa6 Be careful. It should not touch your fingers \xe2\x80\xa6 What is, this is clean?\xe2\x80\xa6 I thought it was \xe2\x80\xa6 From Melbourne, somebody can come \xe2\x80\xa6 What is that? These are the Ida Nadi names. Unmarried girls. With this finger you do like that, on both the sides. Debbie, come and do it. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Just beyond that. Just put the line like that. This side. It\xe2\x80\x99s to be done like this. And on the back. You then have to put it under My, on the sole. You can move all the things.\nAre you doing on this side as well? Also down there. You have to complete as well. That\xe2\x80\x99s all done. To the line, up to the line you have to do the same thing. Whole thing up there. Yes. All right. And more. Just to the line, you just do that. That\xe2\x80\x99s good. Still complete it. Yes, correct. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I mean, whatever you\xe2\x80\x99ve put, more of that. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. That\xe2\x80\x99s correct. Now, I mean, extra that you have on My fingers \xe2\x80\x93 on My toes, just take it out. Now, can you get some married ladies also? Too much. With your hands, take it out. That\xe2\x80\x99s better. Take this also. Be careful. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the line. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the line. This line you should not spoil. Yes, be careful. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. There\xe2\x80\x99s so much to be done. There\xe2\x80\x99s a sari here. Just wipe your hand on this \xe2\x80\xa6. Now, what you can do is to get the sari.\nBrought the sari? Take it down there. All right. Call one of them, who are other assisting, in front. The girls have to sit here. Yes, this one \xe2\x80\xa6 Give it to her, with a \xe2\x80\xa6 You can take that coconut. Bangles. You see, there are small and big. because it\xe2\x80\x99s two-and-a-half \xe2\x80\xa6 Better let them come now. They have to come. You have to do the sari. Now you have to organise these flowers, under My feet, but all the white under My feet, ones on the side \xe2\x80\xa6 So you put all the white, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put My feet afterwards. Now the light colors, like pink. Leaders \xe2\x80\xa6 Namaskar \xe2\x80\xa6 May God bless you all. May God bless you. See how everything is quiet. Just before Aarti it started raining, and now see \xe2\x80\xa6 beautiful. All right. You take a photograph of My feet? Just leave this \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nTalk after Mahavira Puja. Gidgegannup, Perth (Australia), 28 March 1991.\nAlso we can take without the \xe2\x80\xa6, one of My body and face, because without the \xe2\x80\xa6 You see, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any, very few photographs without this.\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any anyoneyour recent photographs. And you are famous, all over the world! They call it as \xe2\x80\xa6.\nWell done. Good. The rain\xe2\x80\x99s stopped, everything is all right. All Bhairava\xe2\x80\x99s work. So, firstly we have to give the leaders, so just \xe2\x80\xa6. Everything.\n02:58\nI can have it after lunch, not just now. I think first of all you get out the saris. What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\n04:01\nWah wah! Very good. You all have written the names, so I will see them Myself.\n04:23\nWho did that come from? All right. Who is Kabir? All right. Tegan, who\xe2\x80\x99s that? Good. Anya, which one is she? Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s done very nicely. Very good. And who\xe2\x80\x99s this one? Who has done this one? Justin. Who is Justin? Thank you very much.\n05:58\nI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better distribute the prasad. Wah wah! \xe2\x80\xa6 Apron, apron. A beautiful one! Very sweet now. You see, when I\xe2\x80\x99m cooking I can wear this one, all right? Very well done! What do you want Me to cook for you? Beautiful! All right.\n06:45\nFirst give those sweets and things, and chocolates \xe2\x80\xa6\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? You made it? Good. Thank you. \xe2\x80\xa6 From yoghurt? \xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, beautiful! From where did you get them? From the beach? Beautiful, really very beautiful.\nBeautifully made, eh? Very nice! She\xe2\x80\x99s an artist \xe2\x80\xa6\nThis is the kind of Ganesha was standing behind Me. See that photograph? Exactly like that. You have seen it? Without seeing, you have done \xe2\x80\x93 great! You must see that photograph.\nOh, very sweet of you. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you, Bhairava. \xe2\x80\xa6 A little bit, eh? \xe2\x80\xa6 Thank you. Thank you. \xe2\x80\xa6\n10:00\nYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear My purse, eh? Oh, what a purse! Is it made here? What a beauty! Beautiful, very good. Very artistic, eh? \xe2\x80\xa6 Why did they use these colors? Most artistic \xe2\x80\x93 nature and all \xe2\x80\xa6 What a beauty it is! Thank you very much. It\xe2\x80\x99s a special thing, called something special? \xe2\x80\xa6 Thank you very much.\nWhat are you doing, all the time giving presents to Me? \xe2\x80\xa6 You have given Me eggs, this, that \xe2\x80\x93 now, what more?\nThe purse is an idea, because it should help Me: in India they can paint all this, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t have ideas. You are very artistic people here, I must say, very artistic, because of the nature.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? Oh! No wonder I wore a \xe2\x80\xa6 ! It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful! Beautiful. You know how to choose present for the birthday of Christ! And what is this one is, porcelain? Plaster. We have to be careful. Better be careful. It\xe2\x80\x99s an old thing, is it? You can see the face. But maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a porcelain? Be careful, I mean, you have to really. Beautifully done! See her cloth, the red and the blue; and see, I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing the same combination. But you have to be a little careful of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Beautiful!\nThe rain disappeared. I just meditated on it. I meditated for one minute, and it disappeared. But this Bhairava is terrible, He would not allow Me to speak! Just pulling Me down. But I managed it. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a nice lecture, you know. If it\xe2\x80\x99s taped give Me a copy, and send it to her. Very good lecture. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never spoken about Bhairavanath. Make a copy, it will be a good present. Before I go if you can give the copy, it will be a good idea.\nbr&gt;\nAnd some chana also. Like children, I also love chana. And popcorn! They are all enjoying. You love popcorn only, do you? You don\xe2\x80\x99t like this? I think better distribute, otherwise it will be left out. You like chana? Give to children. Better take the cake around \xe2\x80\xa6 No, this I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry: it\xe2\x80\x99s rather sour, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? For children, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s sour! \xe2\x80\xa6 Beautiful! \xe2\x80\xa6.\nEinstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory \xe2\x80\xa6 Boomerang \xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s the theory of Einstein; you see, he has used this \xe2\x80\xa6 According to him, the light doesn\xe2\x80\x99t travel in a straight line but \xe2\x80\xa6 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it reflects. It boomerangs. \xe2\x80\xa6\n[A Yogi asks about a cure for a possession.]\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of a possession. Maybe you use the light. Light will help a lot. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been to some guru or someone? \xe2\x80\xa6 Who said? \xe2\x80\xa6 No, no, it can be removed with Sahaja Yoga, anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like permanently with Sahaja Yoga. Every kinds of curse can be removed, family or anything.\n20:06\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s for a teenage girl, you see, this one! It\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful. \xe2\x80\xa6 Give it more to the children there. Take all the chana. They\xe2\x80\x99re the Realized souls now. \xe2\x80\xa6\n22:33\nYou wanted Me to talk about children and all that, is it, here? Should I say some few words? Everywhere I have to say \xe2\x80\x93 all right!\n24:31\nTALK AFTER MAHAVIRA PUJA\nSo now we have talked about Bhairava, and we have seen how negativity acts within us and how we get caught up. So, I would say that we must always keep in mind that we have a soul, and that soul can be attacked. It has been already attacked when, with all the kind of things we have had in these modern lives, it\xe2\x80\x99s already under attack. But now we have to cleanse it, and put it right. If you really want to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and cleanse yourself, then you have to understand that we need lot of introspection, lot of introspection.\nNow the people who are left-sided are sort of, they are not straightforward, and they are sly and they talk ill about others. Last time I discovered that in Perth there was a lot of things people were talking, and I wanted to remind you again that I heard about it; also that even now in Australia that kind of people are still there who just start at the back saying things. One person says something, another listens to it and it\xe2\x80\x99s very, very bad thing; because talking ill about others means you first of all get the ill within you. The second is that the way you propagate, you stop Divinity spreading out. Thirdly, you grow into negativity yourself and to whomsoever you talk, that person also gets infected. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a disease.\nSo, I think in Australia throughout we have to be very careful because we have had two big somersaults, you can say, with big falling, because of this only. That secretly \xe2\x80\x93 and this is a side, I would say, Australia is very left-sided, otherwise also because of Ganesha\xe2\x80\x99s place. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Ganesha was placed here, to save you and to put you right as far as the left side is concerned. And we have to be very cautious because that temperament develops, you know, depend on. Like also it is in England quite a lot, but say not in America, say not in Austria, not in Russia, Germany: they are on the contrary, open and they can be aggressive, but they are not sly.\nSo either you are aggressive or you are sly. Accordingly you must find out within yourself what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you, and where are we wrong. Because after all we are Sahaja Yogis, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great chance we have got that we have got our Realization, and that now we have reached a stage where we really are placed in the Kingdom of God. But now how far you go into it depends only on you.\nNow Russia \xe2\x80\x93 why we were successful, because people are very introspective. If you read any book of Russian writers like Tolstoy or anyone, anything they do, say even when they fall in love or anything, immediately they start introspecting: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, why am I falling in love? Why this happening to me? Why I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking like that? Why I\xe2\x80\x99m doing like that?\xe2\x80\x9d You see, they introspect, and that introspection if we do not have within ourselves, then what happens that we can go either to the right or to the left.\nBut in this country I see it\xe2\x80\x99s more the left side: sly things are there. Now how all this has happened that we had some horrible leaders, agreed, and instead of talking about it or telling Me about it, they all just started talking among themselves and all that. And they got all their bad qualities sort of combined within themselves, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how so many lost their vibrations and lost their \xe2\x80\x93 what should I say, the, the searching power.\nSo, when you see a person or anyone who is doing wrong, better is to forget about it. Or if you don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, then you should write to Me. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, better go and talk to that person on his face that: \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is not right.\xe2\x80\x9d But if you write to Me it can be solved, the problem can be solved. Say now, you have one Mr X as your leader or anybody here who is coming say, from New Zealand, or someone from outside. Immediately you should find out, are you critical of him? What are you looking at that person? What are you trying to find out about that person? If you are critical, then know that you can never progress. You should be critical about yourself, not about others. Know that you are most imperfect, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way.\nLike we had a child about nine year old, and he was extremely sly type and he was talking ill like this of this person to that person, and he would go and just jump onto someone, and hit someone \xe2\x80\x93 secretly, not openly.\nSo I called the child and I asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of yourself? Do you think you are the most perfect person?\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. It\xe2\x80\x99s finished.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a person cannot improve.\nSo when you try to find faults with others, know that we have too many faults ourselves. Not to feel guilty \xe2\x80\x93 of course, that point is there also. You should never feel guilty about it. If you have faults, just see, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat faults do I have? How will I correct? What chakras I am catching?\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of seeing the chakras of others if you see your own, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll become purified, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very clean, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be wonderful; everything will be fine. But if you cannot see your own faults, that means you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet got your Self-realization. \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-realization\xe2\x80\x9d means to know about your Self, and this \xe2\x80\x93 the last time I did say all these things here in Perth and also otherwise, that if you talk about somebody like that to spread stories. Ladies specially should be careful because they are on the left, they have to be very, very careful, that they start judging others. They think they are perfect, they judge, they tell their husband, then husband tells another husband, then husband tells his wife \xe2\x80\x93 it spreads. You have to be extremely wise and sensible women. If you are not sensible this will spread like a disease. In Sahaja Yoga this is one of the diseases I dread, is what Christ has called \xe2\x80\x9cmurmuring souls.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cBeware of the murmuring souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeaders are also afraid to tell you something. If they tell you something, immediately you\xe2\x80\x99ll start saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mother said so \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s saying so.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever the leader is saying you must listen to him, must obey him, ask him what, what does he mean by saying this, what is it? Now in case you find something wrong with the leader you are all free to write to Me, and I will definitely go into it. For example, Stephen wrote to Me about someone and I went into this, enquired and found out what was the thing. See, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in finding out about someone. Some lady wrote to Me also and I found it. So, but unnecessarily paying attention to another person is not a good thing. Paying attention to your Self and looking all the good points of another person, of helping another person, that\xe2\x80\x99s how we would be collective, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be growing faster and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be enjoying ourselves.\nNow our children are here. Now what I find, that we do not know really what are the balanced ways of looking after children. So, some think that when I said they are Realized souls, so they said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, let them do what they like.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not true \xe2\x80\x93 otherwise if that is so they would have been born out of the trees, you see! Why are they born out of you? So you have a responsibility, whether they are Realized or not. You have a responsibility about your children, and you have to see that you correct them. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\nSome people, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, allow their children to go just so mad and so, they go so amok. In this I would say an Indian parent is an ideal parent. What he will do, he looks after the child. Also in a way, he loves, expresses his love and all that. But if he finds anything wrong with the child, immediately he\xe2\x80\x99ll correct \xe2\x80\x93 immediately, not spare him, in the presence of others. Now, if another person comes and tells about the child that this child has done, immediately he will scold the child. He will never get angry with the another person: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you say about my child now?\xe2\x80\x9d but thank him that \xe2\x80\x9cThank God you have told me\xe2\x80\x9d; because he might be spoilt more.\nLike I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, we had one Avadhut \xe2\x80\x93 now he\xe2\x80\x99s a grown-up boy, but when he was young \xe2\x80\x93 one day he asked Me that \xe2\x80\x9cIf you leave your parents, the badhas of your parents, they leave you or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, they may not leave, the badhas of your parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of leaving the parents?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is leaving parents?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard that in the Western countries people- children leave their parents when they are eighteen years of age. But I would not like to leave the parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? You can be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll be free to do wrong. Who will correct me? If I take the cigarette in my hand, who will correct me? Who will tell me, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI mean, if a child takes a cigarette in the hand, immediately the father will take the cigarette and burn it, also. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd next time I see you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll burn your tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d Finished.\nBut the child knows that \xe2\x80\x9cThe father loves me, and loves me in such a way that I should not lose my father.\xe2\x80\x9d But he must know that he can lose the kindness of the father. If you allow the child just all the time to behave the way he likes, or it likes, then it will sit on your head.\nAnd today only I was discussing with him, and I told him that I was traveling one day with one lady in the train, one of the Sahaja Yoginis, and her child was there, not very old, must have been about seven years of age. She was trying to talk to Me and this fellow was all the time, \xe2\x80\x9cMummy, Mummy\xe2\x80\x9d and then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d was going on, you see, all the time.\nI told her, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy must you answer all his questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is just making enquiries.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing sensible enquiries, just it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense. He wants to attract your attention. So why do you want to pay so much attention to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, how to stop it?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop it in one minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, I asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not ask so many questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are stupid. You have to learn a lot still, and if you go on asking question like this you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very, very stupid and one day you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go like a madman. Do you want to become a madman?\xe2\x80\x9d He got the fright of his life. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll become mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd you see, if any of your children are there, you have to tell them some stories. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how. Some children have a habit of beating others or doing something; then you said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow if you beat, then a tail comes out of your bottom like that, you see, like a doggy\xe2\x80\x9d and something like that. And they believe it! They believe it.\nNext day they\xe2\x80\x99ll ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a tail coming out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n[Laughter]\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, maybe, maybe. So now, you are going to behave?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be very \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9d\nYou see, all these tricks have to be played to your children. But they\xe2\x80\x99re very clever and they know how to make you dance, you see, how to make you their sort of slave sometimes, you know: for everything they will demand \xe2\x80\x9cdo this, do this.\xe2\x80\x9d Now because they\xe2\x80\x99re Realized souls .\xe2\x80\xa6 I was surprised that when I went to London, you see, I read in the newspaper the statistics about children, that every week in London city only, two children are killed by parents. I mean, that was too much for Me.\nSo I just blasted all of them and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing doing, you must love your children.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a result all the children sat on their heads, you see, and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the programs. If they came to the programs they were, the children were to be kept outside like doggies, tied together something; and in England I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe here also, they do have a leash, just like a dog. You see they hold the children just like this. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow cruel it is.\xe2\x80\x9d But now I know how children can be in the West. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s white skin or whatever you may say, that first we started a school, you see, for them because there was no school available, they were in a mess. So we said, all right, in Dharamshala we\xe2\x80\x99ll start a school.\nSo we started a school in Dharamshala, and these children were brought because they had no way to go anywhere, so in a hurry it was started, you see. So there must be something also if you just start a school in a great hurry, maybe some things are left out. But these children were terrible because they saw these teachers were Indians, so they came and started punching them, they started showing tongue to them, sometimes spitting at them, sometimes pinching and doing all kinds of things, you know. So the teachers got a fright.\nThey said, \xe2\x80\x9cBaba, we can\xe2\x80\x99t look after these bounders, God knows what they are up to. One day they\xe2\x80\x99ll bring a knife and push it through us. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd we have had very bad experience in Shudy Camp about these children, that they had no sense of proportion, nothing, they were not cautious at all. And then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have already started jumping,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom different places.\xe2\x80\x9d (I hope they are not jumping there.) Ah. So \xe2\x80\xa6 and one boy broke his leg. They got a fright.\nSo I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, now you do one thing. They are already spoilt, but take one foot-rule, ruler, and keep it and say that \xe2\x80\x98If you misbehave, this is the thing.\xe2\x80\x99 And once or twice just do a little bit like that.\xe2\x80\x9d Now that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you go on beating your children. I mean, everything should not be taken to an extreme, but there should be a balance \xe2\x80\x93 must understand.\nSo there was one boy who had come as a cook from Austria. And Yogi had asked him \xe2\x80\x93 he thought that he is a Westerner \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better look after the children.\xe2\x80\x9d He started thrashing them left and right. Not the Indian women. Indian women don\xe2\x80\x99t thrash so much, you see, we don\xe2\x80\x99t beat. I mean, I have slapped My daughter once, one daughter, elder one and younger one twice in their lifetime. We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in thrashing, but you see they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of our eyes, even they know what we want, what is good.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, My younger daughter she, when she went to college in Delhi she found all the girls were wearing sleeveless blouses. So she came and asked Me, \xe2\x80\x9cShould I wear sleeveless blouses? Because all the girls are wearing sleeveless blouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead, if you think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cMummy, why don\xe2\x80\x99t You wear sleeveless blouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel shy, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve worn it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to expose My hands like that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not good. The arms, you see, should be covered, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\nImmediately she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen it is no criteria if I say \xe2\x80\x98I want this\xe2\x80\x99 and all that, You should say \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 to everything \xe2\x80\x93 You should have said \xe2\x80\x98No, no\xe2\x80\x99 to me. I would have been very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo this wisdom is there in, among Indian children. They like \xe2\x80\x93 like Avadut, as I told you, he said that \xe2\x80\x9cThen who will correct me, who will stop me from doing wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d But that\xe2\x80\x99s not with our children here. So you see, because, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but maybe that our roots are too deep or whatever it is, we are a little controlled all the time. And wisdom is very important. If you tell a child \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been very unmannerly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s like saying the horridest thing to a child, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re unmannerly.\xe2\x80\x9d Or to say \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very unwise\xe2\x80\x9d; then the child feels very hurt, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m unwise, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been seeing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut the best thing would be to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are Sahaja Yogis, you are special people. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do like that, you are Sahaja Yogis.\xe2\x80\x9d All the time go on telling them how dignified they should be, what is expected of a Sahaja Yogi \xe2\x80\x93 it is better. But never spoil them. This is one thing you should not do, otherwise it will be a permanent headache for you. Even if they are Realized souls, whatever they may be; but please see that you do not spoil them. That\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\nAlso as I told you, that don\xe2\x80\x99t talk ill of each other on the back. Is a very bad habit. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch on bhoots and you\xe2\x80\x99ll become extremely negative. Any such thought comes into your mind, just stop it. Is a very, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very nasty disease, you see, that spreads, so it makes you \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s so sickening, you know. When I hear about somebody who talks ill of someone it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely sickening, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not being human. You see, in the animal, there\xe2\x80\x99s one animal called hyena, and they say this hyena is like that. It comes slowly and steals a child or anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very sly type of an animal. And such a person we call as hyena in India, such a person is called as a hyena, and is regarded as a very low type of a personality, they talk like this.\nIn Sahaja Yoga it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t behove. No Sahaja Yogis should talk ill about each other. Nor should they discuss each other. Never! Now somebody does that, you must immediately say: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, please, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. This is not a very good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d The politicians do like that, but not Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis should not do because, you see, you are great people, you are Yogis. Do you know how a Yogi becomes a Realized soul, in the normal way?\nThe other day I was reading a book about Upanishadas, and one of them was \xe2\x80\x93 today only I saw it in the morning time when I got up. There was written about a Yogi, that you have to really starve yourself, first of all is. Then you have to do shirshasana. With that you have to do pranayama. Then you have to get up four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning and take your bath, and then sit down for dhyana, and for five hours you must sit for your dhyana. After that you have to do pranayama. That\xe2\x80\x99s also special style, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for normal person to do that: is till you say sixty you raise your left side, take the prana through your, I mean you breathe through your nostril, left one. Now sixty-four you say, keep it here, and then rechaka: you do the taking it out thirty-two times, can you imagine? This you have to do hundred-and-eight times every day, minimum. This is the minimum. Now there are so many exercises, if I tell you that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked.\nSo, like you have to stand and suddenly jump, and put your both the feet five feet apart \xe2\x80\x93imagine. Then turn round: to clear your nadis, you see, you have to turn round and put yourself on the left side. Now on the left side you put yourself, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a big thing that they have described but in short it\xe2\x80\x99s a stretching exercise, and you put your hand on the left side and go down, stretch yourself. Again go back to normal, again jump and go five feet apart. Then put to the right side. Nadi cleansing is this way. But there are so many others described, you see. They are so horrible. He said, ordinary exercises for ordinary people, but for a person who wants to achieve yoga, he has to do all these horrible exercises are, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, by that time all your body will be broken, the way it is; or you\xe2\x80\x99ll in any case get moksha, you see! It\xe2\x80\x99s like that.\nBut what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to tell you is this, that now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got everything simple, easy, this thing. But in a subtle way still all these nonsensical things are sticking on. And even if you are in the boat now, still it is there and they are creating a heavy weight. And this heavy weight can really take you down again; and when you go down after a certain height, you go down very fast. So many people we have thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, so many have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, so many have come into Sahaja Yoga. Now the people who have come in the beginning are excused for some time, and also they see you, how you behave \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\nSo first thing we must know that we are people who are Sahaja Yogis, special type of people, specially placed and we have so many privileges, so we have to be extremely dignified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people just will laugh for nothing at all. In a group you are there, they just start laughing. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to laugh, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll just start laughing. Even if I am sitting they\xe2\x80\x99ll just go on chatting and talking and \xe2\x80\x93 see, no sense at all. But if your Guru is sitting there you have to keep quiet, you have to be humble, you have to have awe. All these things are important which we have to gradually learn, because you have never had a proper training about spiritual life. You see, what these churches, or you can say these temples that you have seen, or anything else that you have got those, you see, have not been real masters to tell you how to behave, how to address, how to be there.\nSo now gradually you should see for yourself that you have to grow, and grow very fast. And for that you have to remember we must need our introspection, to see \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I? Now what am I doing? Ah, now the anger is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as the anger starts coming, go and stand before your mirror and say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow come along, let\xe2\x80\x99s get angry.\xe2\x80\x9d You face yourself all the time, and it will help \xe2\x80\x93 not the others.\nNow I have to tell you that whenever you find such people coming up, they will form a group. Then a group can become bigger or absolutely small, depending on you. You have to just say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother has said not to listen a word against anyone\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 just not to listen. And in the beginning of course, it is quite a lot has to be tolerated. Like I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, if you see the letters written to Me in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, they are so maddening. This person talking ill about that, that person talking ill about that; I mean, anybody would be mad to read all that. So I never read them. All these letters I used to just burn away.\nBut luckily now these people have become extremely sensible, they understand their responsibility, they have become very, very beautiful people, very understanding; and the love that they have for each other, it\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting. Only in love you can know about others, not in hatred. If you hate someone how will you know about that person, the beauty of that person? So then you start seeing the beauty of that person and you start enjoying that person. This is what Sahaja Yoga is. So I would like you to see that you train your children in such a manner that they feel their responsibilities as Sahaja Yogis.\nMay God bless you.\nBetter be on the lookout, there\xe2\x80\x99s smaller children also.\nAnd never neglect them; of course, never neglect them. Never leave them alone. Even if you are going, doing a job, you can give it up for the children\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for certain age. Then you can take up when they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\xa6 There are so many things you can do in the house also for ladies. And also men should understand that they must every day spend some time with their children. This is extremely important; because children are so relaxing.\nLook at her, she\xe2\x80\x99s running off. My attention is all there. I hope they don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\xa6 Are they careful children? Or keep someone there \xe2\x80\xa6 Some lady can be alternately with children, one after another, better look after them.\nSo now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice place we have come to, and I hope this work will be done now. We have done the inauguration and it will be all ready. It would be as they said, would be three storeys. Would be a good idea if it works out, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are going to do here, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to work out. Did you dig it out for your \xe2\x80\x93 is it? \xe2\x80\xa6 Fireplace? It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a fireplace. And what will you have up there, in the gap? \xe2\x80\xa6 Another on top? Good. How did you carry it up there? \xe2\x80\xa6 Prefabricated.\n52:54\nSo now what is the next program? Is the lunch, is it? All right \xe2\x80\xa6 Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s there. Please look after them. Alternately, you see, can do it.\n54:54\nYou should finish everything, you know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave anything here.\n58:46\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too much. Now you eat this one. All right? I can\xe2\x80\x99t have so much of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a heart here!\n59:01\n[Yogini asks about looking after Western teenage children.]\n59:14\nWhat happened? \xe2\x80\xa6 Fourteen and fifteen? And they\xe2\x80\x99re not in Sahaja Yoga? \xe2\x80\xa6 I think you need to send them to some school in India. \xe2\x80\xa6 Not Australian? \xe2\x80\xa6 He will allow? Into \xe2\x80\x93 it need not be, you see, it need not be a Sahaja school, just not started, but we can put them in a school which is, what you can call it a normal Indian school. One of the admissions you can get them, in a hostel. That will save them. And once we start our high school, they can join us. Because they have to be brought up properly. \xe2\x80\xa6 Also, there are so many other temptations, I can tell you. It\xe2\x80\x99s very dangerous. \xe2\x80\xa6\nYou give Me their names. You can get them admitted. Send it to you. And say that these children would like to get admitted into some school there. But the standard in India is very hard. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go one year less, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all right; but they\xe2\x80\x99ll have very good education there. Go with her and find out a school. It can be anywhere: in Bombay, Pune, anywhere. That would be cheaper, definitely, than schools here, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be disciplined. I agree with you \xe2\x80\xa6 Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s bothered, you see. Because they trouble the teacher also. And also the government is not bothered. Children are so precocious, they know so many things \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s horrible, I tell you. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to understand such small children knowing things which we did not even know when we were medical students. \xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, thank you.\nTwo, three children, or which is the youngest? The youngest is what age? She\xe2\x80\x99s the youngest. What is her age? \xe2\x80\xa6 Eleven. Still she\xe2\x80\x99s not very young. Three of them can go. Big for her age, and very good. So he\xe2\x80\x99s very tall, eh? They get taller and taller, eh? What\xe2\x80\x99s your height now? You\xe2\x80\x99re already five-ten, or something? Your father is tall, is he? Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. You\xe2\x80\x99d like to go to India? Good. Nice. You should find out a school. \xe2\x80\xa6.\n1:03:42\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what they told Me when the children \xe2\x80\xa6.\n1:04:04\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t be going to India for quite some time, but we could ask Yogi if he can arrange for their admission into some good school. \xe2\x80\xa6 What class are you? Eleven. O-level? \xe2\x80\xa6 You should finish, I think, in any case. Otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99ll be just \xe2\x80\xa6 That is O-level, no? A-level \xe2\x80\xa6 So you have done A-level already? You are doing O-level. I think let him finish O-level, is important. Then he goes to college? You can get an admission in college. After one year. In India he goes into a college. He can take up arts or something like that, whatever \xe2\x80\xa6 You want to do computer? What do you like? What subjects you have now? Maths, eh? You don\xe2\x80\x99t like maths. Now, what else? Biology? You have biology. You like biology? \xe2\x80\xa6. Genetics \xe2\x80\xa6.\n1:07:09\nAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see now for a college for you, whatever he wants to do. Is he good at English? You like to write? You\xe2\x80\x99d like to do journalism? Think about it. Let us know. Journalism is easy in India, if you want to do journalism, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to do. But even genetics you might find admission \xe2\x80\x93 you try. \xe2\x80\xa6. Thirteen. Now, what class he is? Yes, he can go to school. \xe2\x80\xa6 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. This shawl is quite good.\n1:07:58\nBy next April will it be ready? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here! \xe2\x80\xa6. Once you teach them, they will do it. And this gets fixed into it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything. \xe2\x80\xa6.\n1:08:42\nIs that cement blocks \xe2\x80\xa6?\n1:09:04\nWe too have something like this, but they are very weak in India. \xe2\x80\xa6. But these can hold two storeys? Really? \xe2\x80\xa6.\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi\n'
