The most important part of Sahaja Yoga is that, to go ahead in it, you have to meditate.. Meditation is very important. Even if you don’t do anything else but meditate, you can go ahead in Sahaja Yoga. As I told you, this is a new path, a new dimension. A new thing.. In which you have jumped in. In your mind, in that Sea you have got in.. But if you wanna get inside of it, you have to meditate..

Some people say, Mother I don’t get time to meditate. Modern Man has clock now a days to save time. But he doesn’t know what is he saving time for? That he doesn't know. The time is being saved for Sahaja yoga. There was this gentleman who wanted to go to London. He was saying, Mother please get me the ticket talk to someone in air India, please let me go there, I have to go through this plane only.. Mother asked, what's the matter, what is important , he said Mother I must go there I have to save time?

Whats the matter, why are you saving time to go there.. Mother because there is a special dinner and then there is a ballroom..

Just remember that the watch on your hands are just for Sahaja Yoga. The person who spends his whole time in Sahaja Yoga, he is not important that you don’t do Office work or house work, but do it in Meditation.. While doing every task, you can be nirvachar.. When you are in thoughtless, you ll get all , beauty, knowledge of that task and all joy of that task.. People don't understand this, this is why they start fighting that they are not getting time for meditation. But what you start enjoying It, you realize that once you start meditating, even your sleep gets shorter, even in your sleep you go into meditation.

You don’t have to leave or decrease anything. But what we think are very important don’t stay as important, and what we don’t think special become special. Before meditation remember one thing, which instrument (Veena) in which this alaap is going to start should be clean. You are not that Veena or that Alaap but you are owner of it.. You are the one who is playing it and enjoying alaap. If that Veena is not in tune, wires are rusted, then its importatnt that you clean it. If they are not right, then you don’t have that sweetness in your life, you cant get that beauty. You have that biliousness, dryness and instability in your vision. For a Sahaja Yogi, it becomes a big thing for me that some Sahaja yogis are meditating with that determination and going deeper. Where as others are not.. I cant say if all of you can go into that state but you should do everything to get into it, whether you have anything else in life or not..

People will talk about everything else but not about going deeper than this.. Like about meditation, improving youself, cleaning youself. He said this, he said that, this should have happened, this shouldn't have happened, Does it look good for a Sahaja Yogi? When you have this huge wealth of Nirvichar (Thoughlessness) then we should bring it out fully. You know that every moment you are getting it and also losing it. Every moment is important. What about holding or letting it go, have I told you anything.. So should I leave family life? No, did I leave it.. You know that I work harder than most of you. But I am not tired, because you give me joy, when I see you, it gives me joy.. My heart fills with joy..

Whatever has importance, keep your attention there.. I don’t say that you should sit here 24 hour.. But where ever you are sitting, jyst keep sitting there on that thrown. So many people don’t have physical problems, but there are still some mental questions. Forget about all those things. Every person can get it. It is your birth right because it was with you at your birth. But you have to meditate. But don't worry about arranging it, don’t worry about it. How does it matter if there are 10 people more or 10 people less? Instead of 1000 bad people, just 10 good people is good for Sahaja. Please be one of those 10 people who are enjoying Sahaja, doing Sahaja Woek with extreme love, enjoying it, and are standing in first lane. Like the Himalayas who is the highest and everyone looks at it. Let everyone look at you and think, that I should be like that person, if I grow in Sahaja, I grow like him.

This is something of inside and not outside. I know who is going where. You are blocking yourself, no one else can stop you. No person in the world, Mantra tantra can stop you.. You stay with yourself.. Just witness which person talks about what, you ll know that there is some negative in that person which is why he or she is talking about that.. Whether it is your husband or wife, you don’t have to argue, there is no point.. He or she will get better on their own.

Not just that, you know that if you have any deformities, you know how to move your hands and clean them. Even in your finders and hands, all gods are awakened. But it is very important that these gods are not insulted anywhere. They should be worshipped in properly. Our hands should be like , that they are worshippable. People should feel that these hands have the flow of Shri Ganga. The reason why River Ganga is pure is flowing through your hands. The energy which is running whole universe is flowing through you. This hands and legs where the energy is flowing, keep them pure.. Its not about just cleansing but about doing things from it do it with beauty and in worshipping way.

Your job is to get speed up in meditation, that’s your job. If someone says that I do this or that, then you should know that I release my Maya and a lot of people have got hurt because of it. Its just happening, like this is moving, this is coming.. Do everything in Akarma. Hyst kuje Sun never says that I am giving the light to every. He is just giving me. He is flowing that huge energy from it. Just like that those energies are flowing you because you are micro machines. You are like a machine, not like sun, but a very special machine, a micro machine. Inside of you they flows through you will give you a different feeling but they will givestop for other.. There will fi small sma

This energy is energy of love. This is why it. If you wanna clean this worldly machine, you can fix them by changing parts, rubbing against somethinng, filing.. But the Human machines are much more complex than that. They can not be fixed that way. They could be cleansed only by love. They have so many scars. You can only fix those with love.. Human is very sad.. These vibrations are nothing but love.. When you lose love, you lose vibration..

Mother we had a badha, these vibrations have stopped coming.. Its because the love has stopped.. When it starts, vibrations will start flowing again. If you are holding on to Love, vibrations will keep flowing.. Because that love will stay on God, that is flowing.. This is an amazing feeling, it has amazing inscribe. Will it get destroyed if

Everything you can know yourself, else I am here to explain you everything.. But I have to give a small suggestion, just think about it, are you qualified to get it? Just because you came to my attentions you don’t become eligible. You become eligible when you get those depth. Like the pot, the deep it is, more water it gets.. If it is small, it will overflow.. You have to have that depth in your meditation.. Look at those meditate. Go deeper in that after thoughless.. You're consciousness will go away and then you will know the highest..

It is the first time that you know yourself and other via collective consciousness.. But very few people value it..

Some of you say, Mother if you take money from people, they will value it.. But Money is a Bhoot.. If by taking money you understand its value, then its better you don’t.. No one can understand it from money, you have to give yourself.. And how can get it, ** 18:00

You have to come fully in meditation as group. It is very important.. Even if you do it once a Month, you have to do it.. Its part of the Virata, so every part of it has to awaken. The more it is awaken…

You guy who meditate everyday at home you can see you didn’t do much as compared to those 6-7 people who came here everyday and rose.. If in meditation your eyes are blininking it means you aagneya chakra is getting hurt.. Nothing to take personally here, it means you have to fix it.. If you are sitting in meditation but your body is shaking that means your mooladhara chakra is getting hurt.. Which is much more Dangerous.. So for Mooladhara has to be fixed..

In order to understand, you can listen to all my lecture and know everything.. But a few new comers can go ahead of you.. Its not about something to learn and teach.. Its not about that..

He gave Bhiksha.. In 16 years I had problems and even lost the job. If you have guru than it shouldn’t have happened.. If there is a Guru or Badha, there is nothing to feel bad about.. But if one has a catch then another peson who has the catch stands up with us. Yyou have to sit everywhere.. You should separate.. Don’t make group. Making group is bad. For kids its fine.. Elders should sit with youngster and youngsters should sit with the elders.. If elders sit together its not good, if youngers sit together its not good, they make a group.. Th understanding of old and young should come in collective vibrations..

Elder should be wise, they should have Baddapan, and youngsters should listen to elders and in youngsters, activities should me more than elders.. If elders are respectable, then people will respect them. But elders should try to be respectful and youngsters should respect elders. One Sahaja Yoga should not Disrepect another Sahaja yogi because in you sit all the gods and goddesses. You can understand all this in your meditation. You ll know that it is happening because other person has aagneya catch or say heart catch so it is happening.. But if you feel bad that itself is a very big negative.. People even take umbrage of what I say so what can I say about other..

So don’t take umbrage of whatever I say because I tell it for your own good.. Whenever you are talking about anything, make sure that you are talking that where is your kundalini, where are we going, how is it.. Everything else is wrong.. How much have we establish ourselves in Dharma.. How much joy we have got, how to go closer to god, we have to tell that only to god.. And we have to know this together and everything else is vain.. When you get this kind of Sahaja Yogi, it will create a huge difference.. The reflection of Sahaja Yoga will come from you.. Whenever you reflect, you becaome witness.. When you become fully reflective then you ll be fully in witness.

Sahaja Yoga won't spread from big bands, events, big size nope.. Nothing will happen from all this. I have never seen these many realized people in my life.. This is amazing.. But as I say, in modern times, no one is complete saints.. You were saints before, lived in jungles.. Now you in this world, part of it.. Try to get down into this saintness, you ll enjoy.. In this Ganga Yamuna will start flowing Saraswati..

When you are going to meditation, forget about all the sounds of Sahastrara.. When you are in meditation, and close your ears, you can still hear because you listen from Sahastrara. Those boys who came here who coulnd hear started hearing a bit from Sahastrara. If your Sahastrara is open, in your lymbic area, you have certain points in your lymbic area which when excited do the exact same job which your mouth, ear, nose do.. All the organs can feel.. If we open same Sahastrara, we don’t need to breath even from nose, you can breathe from Sahastrara. Even if all your body is destroyed still you can do everything from your Sahastrara.. But it doesn’t happen.. Because diseases are not going.. Whoever, rises a bit get cured..

In meditation, if you wanna grow, there is one Guna which you really need.. It is called innocence.. Like a child.. You can see how small kids can rise so quickly. Cunning people, over smart people, they cant go through.. If you give pain, or hurt someone, this is also against the innocence.. If we sit on so many skulls, can we be innocent? If someone is hurt, that person can not be innocent. Innocence itself means, that flower like open which only gives joy to the world, good smell.. Never give pain or hurt anyone. Yes, sometimes people sometimes give paint to people thinking it is good. But don’t do it consciously. You don’t have innocence switch or of peace, kindness.. , let see if you have made any switch like that.. .. First awaken all the deities in you and then one by one all these switches will come up…

But most easy to put is innocence one because we were very innocent when we were kids.. When you spend time with kids and talk to them, then you get lot of innocence. If you remember their voice.

Those who become innocent, they become eligible for kingdom of heaven. In your meditation, just see where is my mind diverting now in what cunning plan, what stupidity. Just witness it.. Thoughlessness is innocence.

When you go into meditation, we wont meditation for that long today but check which chakra is catching.. On your fingers you can tell which fingers are catch, if they are burning just shake it.. Those who are new, see what all catches are there.. All these catches are outside..

Put your self in Bandhans.. This is also a big surrender in itself.. Right in the center is a Shushumna Nadi.. It has to be awakened.. If it is awakened, it means, from all these fingers you ll get cool air.. If you are feeling these cool breeze and you are thoughtless, you are moving forward, like you are in aeroplane and moving forward, you don’t know where it is going but you are going.. Even when you go, don’t destroy collectivity. Fot anything stupid you say, you have to punish yourself.. Whoever talks about things which are of outside, which are no good punish thm..

Don’t talk about outside.. Talk about of inside.. Whoever is getting catch, clean it..

You know other ways to clean yourself in meditation.. Don’t take umbrage when I tell you to do footsoak.. Why you feel bad.. My elder brother is saint..

Kabir also says that he did Jatan.. Why you feel bad.. Don’t feel bad when I ask you for matka.. Get rid of all the illusions you have about yourself, let them go.. You have to be Childlike, not Childish..

Now we will go into meditation

You know that I am your Mother, that means you have complete protection, nothing bad is going to happen.. Just put my eyes.. Just look at your thoughts and you ll be thoughtless.. You should be sure thatI wont hurt.. An dGod forgive all who have hurt me and please forgive me because I have also hurt a lot of people.. Whatever you say, God will do it.. Ask for peace, he will give you peace, give me good character.. Whatever you ll ask you ll get because you have connection with god..

Please give me love, for whole world..

Please give me sweetness, Madhurya..

Whatever you ll ask for, he ll give you..

If you don’t ask for anything else, ask something for yourself, please take me to your feet.. Give me place in your feet.. Take this drop in that ocean.. Whatever impure I have, please remove it..

Whatever you pray to in your prayers, that would happen.. Please make me huge.. Please me smart.. Please give you knowledge, please let me understand you.. Let whole Universe be blessed, let there be love in whole world.. Let there be Kingdom of Heaven on earth.. Please let this deep burn for that.. Let my boyd, my heart, my mind burn for that… Ask whatever is beautiful.. He will give you.. You ask for ugly, he still gives you.. So when you ask for real, will he not give you that? Don’t ask superficially but from your heart.

You must pray, to God and ask, what you want. 

Ask for “Complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful. Give me love, love that I could… love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.
Give salvation to this… humanity. Which is suffering.
Take me to Your feet. Cleanse me with Thy love."

Now see if there is God or not? You can feel it within yourself. He hears you. He understands you. He’s the glory of all the glory. He loves you. He protects you. He guides you. He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

Any time any thought is coming you pray and you will be moving in the waves of that ocean which is unconscious mind, which starts with thoughtless awareness.

[long pause]

If you cannot become thoughtless, you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I have done and forgive those who have done harm to me.”
