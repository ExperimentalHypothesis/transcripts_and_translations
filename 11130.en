The most important thing in Sahaja Yoga is that, to progress in it, to grow, you have to meditate. Meditation is very important. You may not do anything else, but if you remain in meditation, then you can progress in Sahaja Yoga. As I told you, this is a new path. It is a new dimension; it is a new thing in which you have jumped. With your unconscious mind, you have entered that great ocean , that is true. But if you want to go deeper into it, then you will have to meditate. I also hear from many people that “Mataji, I do not get time for meditation.” Today's modern man keeps a watch with him, to save time, all the time, but he does not know what he is saving time for? He has made the watch for Sahaja Yoga, he does not know this.

A gentleman started saying to Me that “It is very important for me to go to London and I have to go by this plane only and somehow my ticket must be booked and you please do something, tell the Air India people and do something.” I said, “What is the problem? Why do you want to go to London? What is that problem? What special work are you going to do there? What is it?” He said, “I must go there, I have to save time, Time is very important”, I said, “What is the matter? Why are you rushing there to save time?” So he said, “There is a special dinner there, I have to attend it and after that there is a ballroom dance.” What are you saving time for?

All the time, you should think that the watch that is tied on your hand is for Sahaja Yoga and meditation. And it is tied for the work of Sahaja Yoga only, I have tied it for that only, otherwise I would never have tied it. A person whose entire time is spent in Sahaja Yoga, it is not necessary that he does not  do household work. It is not necessary that you do not do office work; you can do all the work but do it in meditation, work can be done in meditation because you have been put in meditation. While doing every work, you can be thoughtless and as soon as you become thoughtless, you start getting the beauty of that work, its “complete” knowledge and all its joy.

The thing should be understood; these people don't understand. That's why they don't get separate time for meditation, the arguments start. But when you start enjoying it, then you will be surprised that you sleep very less and you go into meditation. Even in sleep you will think that you are going into meditation. There is no need to leave or reduce anything. But our important things - what we consider important, they are not important at all. And what we do not consider special at all, that becomes almost everything for us.

For meditation you should remember one small thing, that the thing on which the aalap [slow tempo opening part of Indian classical music performance] of meditation will be started, the veena [stringed instrument] on which this beautiful song is going to be played, should be clean. You are not that veena, you are not that aalap either, but you are the one who is going to listen to it and play it. You are its master. So if that veena is out of tune, if its strings are rusted or some of its strings are broken, then it is important that you get it fixed. If they are not fine, then there will be no sweetness in your life. That beauty cannot come inside you, a strange kind of irritability, strange kind of roughness, dryness and distraction will be seen in you.

It is a very big thing for Me, to see a Sahaja Yogi sitting in meditation with a very determined mind. And I see that some Sahaja Yogis are going deep inside and some are very distracted. I am not saying whether all people can reach that state or not. But whatever is possible must be done in this life only. Whatever time is there for earning, it should be spent on this. And whatever can be obtained, everyone should get it in this, whether there is anything else or not.

I see this in most people, they will talk about fifty things here and there, but how many of you talk about meditation, about purifying your mind, about bringing out the joy within yourself? “This person said this, that person said that, this happened, this should not have been done, that should not have been done” – Would it be appropriate for a Sahaja Yogi? When you have such a great wealth of thoughtless awareness, should you enhance it completely or not? You know that every moment you are getting it; and every moment you are losing it too. You see this, how important each and every moment is. Which thing to leave, which thing to hold on to, I would never have said anything like this to you till today.  But this is your delusion. Your mind is confusing you. “So will you leave Your household?” Have I left my  household that  I ask you to leave your household? You know that I work a lot harder than you do. But I do not get tired because you people are the source of my happiness. Whenever I see you, I just become happy. My whole mood becomes full of happiness.

Whatever is important, keep your eyes on that. I do not tell you completely that you should sit here for twenty four hours. Wherever you are sitting, just sit there - this is what I mean. Wherever you are settled, just be settled there, in your place, on your throne. This is why some people make progress and some people don't. Many of your physical diseases have been cured. Many don't have diseases. But still there are mental questions. Forget these things. Every person has the right to get this. It is your birthright, because it is Sahaj, it is born with you. But meditation has to be done and that too in the collective. But you people should not worry so much about organising it. You should not worry so much about making arrangements for it. That work is happening, it will also be done. What is the harm, if ten more people come or ten fewer people. Instead of having a thousand useless people, ten good people are the best thing for Sahaja Yoga.

Become one of those ten good people. These people, who do the work of Sahaja Yoga with great love and are enjoying it, flowing in it, progressing in it, and stand in the advanced rank. Like the Himalayas are the highest in the world. Everyone's eyes are towards it. Become like that. You can become the Himalayas within you and you can see that the world looks at you and says that if I want to become, I should become like this man who has risen so high in Sahaja Yoga. This is an internal rising, not an external one. And I know about everyone, who is reaching where.

You are your own obstacle. And nobody else can stop you. No person in the world can cast any spell - sorcery on you. If you do not harm yourself and keep recognizing what kind of things a person says, you will understand yourself that some evil has come in this person, that is why he is saying such things. Otherwise he would not have said such things. Like he is saying something wrong, there is some problem with him. There is no need to support him. Whether he is your husband or your wife. There is no need to fight or get entangled with him. He will get cured on his own.

Not only this, you also know that if there is some problem in you, then how can you fix it by using your hands, because those things are flowing inside your hands only. Actually, all the deities that I have mentioned are awakened in your fingers, in these five fingers and in this palm, all the deities are awakened here. But it is very important that these awakened deities are not insulted. They should be kept very carefully and with care. They should be worshipped. Your hands should be such that they are worthy of worship. People should think whether these are hands or the flow of Ganga. It should be like the flow of Ganga. The same consciousness that purified Ganga is flowing from within you. The conscious power with which the whole universe is functioning, that only is flowing from within you, you know this.

Then the hands, the feet through which this thing is flowing, should be kept very pure. I do not mean washing. Whatever work you do through these, it should be done very beautifully, smoothly and with love. The biggest thing is love. To advance in meditation, this is your work, nothing else is your work, everything else is happening. And if any one of you starts thinking that I do this work or that work, then you know that I show My illusion and many have been hurt by that. I will do that. I have already told you, never think that I do this work or I do that work. It is happening. Like “this is going and that is coming.” Now in all ways in akarma [non-action] – just like the sun does not say that I give you light. It is giving. Because it is flowing from such tremendous power from God in oneness. Similarly, very subtle powers are flowing from within you because you are a subtle machine. You are not a machine like the sun, you are a special machine, which is very subtle, these beautiful streams flowing from within which will give a strange kind of feeling, but also inside others, their little-little, subtle-subtle aspects, their little-little instruments, machines, they will be immediately set right with love.

This power is the power of love. How do I describe this thing to you? If you want to fix this machine [physical machine], you can fix it by rubbing it with anything, you can put a screw in it, it will be fine. But the machine of man is fixed by love. He has been very wounded. There are many wounds inside him. The man is very sad. You have to heal his wounds with the medicine of love. The vibrations flowing from within you are only love. The day your flow of love breaks, the vibrations stop. Many people tell me, “Mataji, I have got a badha. The vibrations from my hands have stopped.” The flow of love has broken from within you. Hold on to the love, only the vibrations of love will keep flowing. Because this love of God is the only one that is flowing. And only that is flowing. This is such a wonderful experience, such a wonderful time has come. Will all this go to waste because you did not support Me with full dedication in this?

Each and everything you can know by yourself, and if you do not know, I am here always ready to explain everything to you. But I have to give a small suggestion, whether you are authorised to get it or not? Just think about it. Just because you came to My meditation, just like many people in Marathi say, “I came deliberately” - you don’t become authorised. You become authorised because you get that depth.

Like the [clay] pot, the deeper it is, the more water it can hold. Now If it is not that deep, then what's the use of pouring water in it, all that water will flow out. You grow your depth with your meditation. Get settled into meditation, go to meditation. Thoughts which are coming in meditation, just by looking at them, you will become thoughtless. After becoming thoughtless, you will go into the unconscious - will not call it dormant awareness, in the unconscious mind through your awareness. Your own awareness, your own consciousness will not end. There you will know awareness. This has happened for the first time in the human body that you know your own body all well as that of others. You know about others via collective consciousness that what is happening inside them. Very few people understand the importance of it.

Because everyone says to Me that, “Mataji, if you take a rupee [money] from everyone, then they will understand it, because people understand the importance of money.” Money is a bhoot. If by taking money you understand its importance then it is better you don’t understand. No one can understand its importance by giving money. You have to give yourself completely. And by giving that you will get so much.  That which you are waiting for seven lives for, that you will suddenly get in that instant.

In meditation, you have to come in the form of collectivity only. It is very important. Even if you come once a month, you have to do meditation where seven people sit [for meditation]. You can make your own small group, so that you can meet once a week and meet once in a big group. Because I have told you that this is Virata’s work. Like each and every part of the body, it has to be awakened. The more it is awakened, likewise the more lamps will be lit. Even if you people, who meditate everyday at home, after I came, you know that, you observed that you didn’t make any progress. But those six, seven people who used to come everyday and meditated here, they made so much progress.

If in meditation your eyes are blinking, it must be understood your Agnya Chakra has some injury. There is nothing to feel bad about. If your Agnya Chakra is damaged then you should correct it. Because your joy gets reduced. If your body is shaking while being in meditation and if you could not sit comfortably, that means your Mooladhar is injured. This becomes a much more dangerous situation. When your Mooladhar gets an injury, you must treat that also. People know that too, how to correct Mooladhar Chakra. Anyway, you can know everything by listening to all My lectures and learning all about its [chakra’s] science. But I have observed that few people who have come recently a few days back, sometimes get ahead of you very fast in full swing, because this is not about something to teach and write.

If your hands are shaking, they are trembling - then you should understand that there is some serious problem inside you. For this problem, shoe beating is the best treatment. Yesterday a gentleman, you must have seen there, started saying , “Mataji, I became extremely heavy there,” and then began doing yu- yu [Shri Mataji might have been showing some action] in front of Me. So I asked him, “Who is your guru ?” He replied that, “There is one Mr Bhagawat in Pune.” Then I asked him, “What does he do?” Then he said that, “He has started that spiritual thing, Sai spiritual center, and he gave me a diksha [spiritual initiation].” So I asked him, “what diksha he gave; diksha of shaking?” So he said, “For sixteen years, I had health problems, lost my job, this happened, that happened.” I said, “Still you did not get some sense? If you have a guru then it shouldn’t happen to you. How much money did you give?” “Till now, I have already paid five to six thousand rupees to the center.” So I said, “You have paid five to six thousand rupees and got all the sickness?“ Then did shoe beating to his bhoot, to that Mr Bhagawat and also to that his center, shoe beat that also and then the shaking of hands stopped, and he got alright. This happened in front of all of you yesterday; many people were there.

We should tell people clearly that you definitely have someone as a guru and you have some or other badha [catch/obstruction] inside you. Some or other mess is there, there is nothing to feel bad about. But I have seen that, if one has even a slight catch then another caught up person will stand next to him. They all get pulled together in a line. And then it becomes clear that these all people with catches are sitting together. In fact, you should not sit this way. Everyone must sit separately, mostly; many make some sort of group. It is an extremely wrong thing. For example, people from Thane would sit together, so and so comes, not like this. Sit separately. It is very important. Do not sit together.

Another thing is that, like there are some old persons, some are of mid age and some are kids. There are no issues as such with kids but people with mid age and those people [with old age], these all should sit separately. Those who are older should sit with young people. Those who are young should sit with the elderly. If four-five young people get together, it will be a disaster. And even if four-five elders sit together, it creates a disaster. You can see, it happens. The understanding of youth and old age are both things to be shared. That too you can share in the collective consciousness. Elders need to have understanding, should have wisdom; it is necessary. [Elders] must be extremely wise. Greatness is needed, a big heart is needed. And youngsters should give respect to elders, and should listen to elders. And  youngsters should have more activity than elders. If elders are respectable, then they will be respected. But elders should try to be respectful and youngsters should respect elders. Even as one Sahaja Yogi should not disrespect another Sahaja Yogi because you are all like gods and goddesses. You can understand all this in your meditation.

When you think about others from your heart, from mutual conversations you will immediately understand that, “oh, this person has his Agnya Chakra caught, that is why this is happening.” “oh, that person has his Heart Chakra caught, that is why this is happening.” “That’s why the swar [musical note] is not emitting properly.” You will not feel bad. Others will also not feel bad. But feeling bad, that itself is a very big obstruction [negativity]. People feel bad even about what I say, so what can be said about others. You should not feel bad about anything I say.  I am doing every work for your benevolence only, you know that. While discussing anything, we must see that we are discussing only and only about where our Kundalini is? Where are we going? How are [we] ascending? Every other discussion is futile. To what extent have we awakened in the dharma? How much have we got? How much joy from God Almighty enjoying? These are the only experiences we have to share between us. And this is what we have to know between us. And everything else is futile. Silence is the best thing among all other things. When Sahaja Yogis will be like this kind, it will make a big difference. A very big difference.

The reflection of Sahaja Yoga will spread from you. And the thing that reflects, should be very clean. And if its power of reflection gets fully awakened, then there is no difficulty left. Sahaja Yoga cannot be spread by anything else. And not by anything else. You can make big, big organizations, you can have big big mantra-jagran [prayer ceremonies to awake deities], and can have songs [devotional - bhajans] and can make music, It is not going to happen. Nothing will happen from all this. I have never seen so many realized people, as much as I'm seeing today. It is our great fortune that I am able to see this. Never in any era, so many realised people, were there in front of My sight. This is the matter of supreme fortune.But like I say, in modern times, no one is a complete saint here. You people only were great saints before, and were not involved in the world [worldly life], used to live in forests. Now you have taken over the world and you are immersed in the world. But  once you get into your own saintliness, what joy you will get. Like in this Ganga-Jamuna only,  Saraswati started flowing. When you start going into meditation, you will forget any outside sound. If you put your fingers in your ears, and if your Sahasrara is completely open - that is the sign - if you close your eyes completely, you can still hear. That's why, those boys who came here who couldn’t hear, started hearing a little bit .

If your Sahasrara gets open in your limbic area, doctor people know all of this, that there are subtle points, there are subtle centres, which when excited, does the exact same work which your nose, ear, mouth and all physical organs do. We awaken that Sahasrara, which manages the whole body and you, everything just like fragrance is there, everything, you don’t need a nose. Then you can also breathe from here [Sahasrara]. Even if your whole body gets destroyed, then also you can do every work from here [Sahasrara] but it [your body] is not destroyed. Your body goes on blossoming. Your body is becoming beautiful. Diseases have already disappeared. All of that has already gotten better. Even if some or more are left, it gets cured easily.

But, to grow in meditation, one quality is very much needed. Highly needed. It is called innocence - purity, simplicity, innocence just like a small child. That’s why you must have seen that small children get through [realisation] so quickly. Clever people, cunning people, those who think themselves to be very smart, they just do not have the desire of God, they just keep showing their smartness, they do not get it. Should be completely innocent. Should try.

To give pain to someone, to give trouble to someone is also against innocence. Can we be innocent, while sitting on so many lifeless heads? If someone’s heart is hurt, that person cannot be innocent. Innocent means only that something is blooming like a flower which only gives fragrance to the world. Should never give pain or hurt anyone. Yes, sometimes people mistake something for suffering due to their stupidity – that is okay. But you should be sure from your side and never give pain or trouble to anyone. But you do not have an innocence switch. I had looked for that, whether you people have made such a switch? If you have, then press that innocence switch and you will see that your Agya Chakra will become completely clean. But you people do not have a switch of innocence, you do not have a switch of compassion, you do not have a switch of peace. You do not have all these switches set up inside you yet. First you awaken all your deities sitting inside you and then one by one all these switches will also be set up. But the most easy to put is the innocence switch, because once we were very innocent when we were born and when we were children. Being with small children brings innocence. Talking with them brings a lot of innocence. Remembering their words brings a lot of innocence. Those people who become innocent, they become entitled to the kingdom of God.

In meditation, just see only for yourself where your mind is diverting now with deceitful plans like a donkey?Doing any foolish act? Just by seeing this you become thoughtless, and thoughtlessness is the innocence.

Now, when you people go into meditation, we will not meditate for too long. But when you go into meditation, just see that which your chakra is catching. Since you are realised souls, you know this very well. You can very well tell on your fingers which chakras are catching, by checking which finger has a slight burning sensation. Whichever finger has the burning sensation, give a bandhan and it will go away. If your fingers are burning too much, just shake your hand, it will go away. Give a bandhan.

But stay in thoughtlessness with your attention on the Sahasrara. Those who have come for the first time, they also have to see if they have received their realization or not. What is wrong with them? What is their problem? Remove it out. All these  problems are external. And you can put yourself in bandhan by moving your hands like this. By pressing in this way. you can just press it like that, or you can press it like that, or you can throw it away like that.

This is also a big surrender in itself where the power comes from both sides, from the expression of the left and right sympathetic nervous system, through that way. And Right in the center is Sushumna Nadi. And just by doing this, your Sushumna Nadi starts working inside. But it has to be awakened. If it is not awakened, it means Sushumna is not working.  And being awakened means that you slowly-slowly get cool breeze from all your fingers. If you are feeling this cool-cool breeze inside you, you are completely thoughtless in that meditative wave, then you are progressing, you are moving forward. It’s as if when you sit in an aeroplane, you don’t know where you are  going but you are reaching somewhere

Whilst I am here, it is necessary that the Sahaja yogis should participate actively and progress. Even after leaving, do not spoil your collective image. If you say anything frivolous to each other, you will see some punishment or the other. Whoever talks anything other than Sahaja Yoga, anything about the outside rather than inside will be punished. Don’t talk anything about the outside. Talk only about inside.

Clean your own chakras. There is nothing to feel ashamed in it. Those who have their chakras caught, it’s from the outside. Clean everything with courage and throw it down. Those whose hands are burning, remove it. My hands are also burning, what to do, if not to remove? One cannot just sit like that.

You know many other ways to clean yourself in meditation. There is nothing to feel bad, if I ask someone, that you keep your feet in water and clean yourself.  What is wrong with that? What is there to feel bad about in it? How stupid is this, about what do people get offended about? They wonder why Shri Mataji has said this to me. Are you a big saint? Even big saints cleanse themselves, you don’t know.

Just like I said about Kabir Dasji, “Das Kabir jatan se odhi” [This body of mine, the sheet which is created by God, I kept it as I got it, didn’t spoil it], Kabir Das also says about himself that he took care of his body, even when he was such a great man. So why should you feel bad? If I ask anyone to bring a matka [earthen pot] they get offended. And then bring a very big matka! Abandon useless things and whatever foolish ideas we have about ourselves. It's childish, not childlike. We have to be childlike and not childish.

Now we will go into meditation. Everybody sit like this. As I said, first fill yourself with love. You know that I am your Mother. You should know with complete confidence that I am your Mother. And being a Mother means there is complete protection, security.  Nothing is going to go wrong. Put your hands towards Me. And slowly close your eyes and observe your thoughts and you’ll become thoughtless. You don’t have to do anything else. As soon as you are thoughtless you will go within yourself.

First tell yourself that from today I have decided that I will not hurt anyone. And God, you forgive all who have hurt me and forgive me because I have also hurt a lot of people in this world.

Whatever you ask for, God will do it for you.

If you say, “God give me peace,” he will give you peace. But you do not ask for peace.

“Give satisfaction”, he will give you satisfaction, [but] you do not ask for it.

“Give me a beautiful character”, he will grant it to you.

Now prayer has a meaning because you have a connection established with Paramatma [God Almighty].

“Fill me with love. Love for the whole world. Give me the melody, give me sweetness.” Whatever you will ask for, He will give it to you. Don’t ask for anything else. Ask only for yourself.

“Absorb me at Your Feet. Absorb my drop into Your ocean. Whatever impurity I have, remove it”.

Whatever you will ask God in your prayer, that will happen.

“Make me vast.

Make me wise.

Give me Your wisdom.

Give me Your knowledge.

May the whole world prosper,

Let there be benevolence for the whole world.

May there be love reign on the whole world.

Let my lamp burn for that. Let this body perish in it.

Let this mind be absorbed in it. Let this heart be consumed in it.”

Think of all the most beautiful things and ask God Almighty for that. Whatever is beautiful, you ask for that only and you will get it. Even if you ask for ugly, He still gives it to you. Even when you ask for useless things, He still gives them to you. So when you ask for real, will He not give you that? Don’t ask superficially, but ask from within.

[Shri Mataji speaks in English]

You must pray to God and ask what you want.

“Ask for complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful.

Give me love, love that I could love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.

Give salvation to this humanity which is suffering. Take me to Your Feet. Cleanse me with Thy love”.

Now see if there is God or not? You can feel it within yourself. He hears you. He understands you. He’s the glory of all the glory. He loves you. He protects you. He guides you. He’s created you to reveal His love, but accept it. Any time any thought is coming, you pray and you will move in the waves of that ocean which is an unconscious mind, which starts with thoughtless awareness. If you cannot become thoughtless, you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I have done and forgive those who have done harm to me.”

[Shri Mataji blows vibrations via mic]

If you are burning too much, you can put your hands outside, towards outside, and one hand towards me, if you're burning too much.
