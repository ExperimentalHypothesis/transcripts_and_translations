[Shri Mataji speaks first in Marathi; English starts at 24:51]

I’m sorry I’ve not been able to speak to you in English language - and I’ve spoken some time. This special day today is the day of Sankranta. San, you know. ‘San’ means "good, holy" and ‘krant’ means the – [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] . When I speak Marathi I forget English.

Sahaja Yogis: Revolution.

Shri Mataji: Revolution. Holy revolution. Holy. And that’s what I’m telling them. What is the Holy Revolution is, that your own Dharma is established now through Sahaja Yoga, you know what is your dharma. Because if you don’t do your own dharmas you’ll be lost. Your vibrations will be lost. You’ll immediately know that in your seeking you have lost something. You’ll be affected and so you have to correct. That’s not so difficult.

When the Sun moves from the left to the right, that means your desire becomes your action.

First of all, to each other. There are many people who will be kind to others because others will eat them off but unkind to their own Sahaja Yogis.
Because it is a universal happening, it’s the whole thing is working out universally. Even if you organize, you organize for the whole. Those who are organizing have no business to be harsh and those who are not organizing has no business to be slow. We must move with the same speed, with the same understanding.

There’s a story in Marathi language which is a very good story that a – [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] – the bird-catcher had put lots of temptations of good grain for some birds – pigeons. And the pigeons didn’t see the nest [net] – the trap – and they all came down to eat that. And there was a net there. In the net, their feet were entangled.
So the solution was found out that: "If all of us with the same speed take off, we’ll take away the whole of the net and then he cannot catch us." So, one person said: "Alright, as soon as I say ‘yes’, let us all start with the same speed. If somebody increases his speed he is brought down."

In the same way, Sahaja Yoga has to be worked out; and that’s why, to keep up the speed, keep yourself peaceful, loving, affectionate. Peace is the way we are going to achieve it. This is an explosive peace. By giving contrasts you bring the balance in: explosive.
You have read also about the Goddess, the different aspects of Goddess. Always: "Ati Saumya, Ati Rudra" [In Devi Suktam from Devi Mahatmya ;"Gentle like the Moon and also terrible like Rudra"]
to give the two contrasts by which bring the balance in the middle.

That’s how you must understand that Sahaja Yoga is a very unique revolution. I told them also politically and also socially, in every way how we are going to improve every country, thus the whole world, the whole universe. Later, on I’ll translate the whole thing for you.

So, today’s special day, very great day, let us ask that, when you are doing this puja, ask for new religions within you to be enshrined, to be sustained within ourselves and try to imbibe them.
They will be permeating but you have to accept them and should know it’s a big fight. And it’s a very different type of a fight of peace and love.
That’s why they say: "Speak sweetly. Be sweet with others." Not to be sarcastic by any chance, nor to be harsh, but be sweet. Sweetness which is genuine, not outward and showing and formal, but genuine sweetness.
May God bless you all.
