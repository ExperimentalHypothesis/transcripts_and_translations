From yesterday's programme, and all these days, you must have realised that to get your Kundalini working out, to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara and to widen your Sushumna Nadi it is not necessary that you should sit for meditation for three to five hours. Of course, you must meditate for a short time because that is at a point where you are alone, one with your God.

But otherwise, in the collective, when you merge into it, then the Kundalini rises the same way. It's a very discreet way of understanding what happens. In the collective when you are, you compensate each other, complement each other, and a subtler side of the cosmos starts manifesting in you. Then if you could really merge there’s a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit language or in Marathi language is very good is ‘ramamaana' [Marathi, coming from 'ramana' in Sanskrit, meaning 'absorbed in joy']. I don't think “merging with joy” but there is no 'with' you see, 'merging into joy'. So if you can merge into the joy of anything that is sahaj you can become a meditative personality, you can achieve that meditative mood within yourself. With that mood, with that force, new subtler dimensions start breaking out within you. Your different kind of conditionings which are like shackles, binding you down, just open out and you become a free person - bandha mukta [free from bonds]. With that force everything breaks: your ego breaks, your conditioning breaks and you become one with the joy of life, Divine life. This you can experience, but to retain it within yourself is only possible if you do your practices in Sahaja Yoga, to control your attention, to keep your attention to higher values, to the higher things.

Let us see what are the low value system that we get into, which is regarded as something very important otherwise.

The first, in the modern times, is the consciousness of time. “What is the time now?” “What time we have to reach?” “Oh God, what is the time we are going to start it?” “What time are we going to sleep?” Now you have experienced that yesterday we went home about six o'clock and slept at six if we slept at all. You were quite tired till two o’clock, I think, then that 'Gondhari' business [Bhajan, "Mateche Gondhari"] started and you again relived the whole sequence with a greater gusto, I must say. [Laughter]

So, at that time, those people who tried to keep dignity and tried to keep out of it, are still keeping down their conditioning. Supposing there is a man who is a governor, for example: a quite healthy, young can dance. I mean, old people need not do all that but at least they can breakthrough very well into the barriers of conditionings. But such a person starts thinking, “What is this going on?” and “Oh, it’s nonsense, how can I join this?” It looks very rustic, sometimes. Looks something not very decent, decorous, like a waltz but is extremely natural and child-like, innocent.

You can make out the people who are still in the barrier. They even find it difficult to say, “Jai Mataji!” Such people are still bound down by the shackles of the worldly life. Then they are all the time, seeing the time, “What is the time?” And again, getting a headache. At such times, you should never see the time because you’ll get a headache if you see it! Realising it's very late, you see. And you say, “Oh God, it's four o'clock we are still here!” [Laughter].

So, it’s important for all of us not to have any watches and even if you have, not to see them, or, even you see them, they should be stopped! [Laughter]. So, you go beyond time. You go beyond time. You don't feel the time, you don't feel the tiredness of time and you just forget yourself, which is tied down by time all the time.

Now. Then the second one is we talk so much, “Oh we should have no religions, no jati [caste], no pati.” Like that we say, all of us, “You should have no caste system,” Indians especially. “Caste system is the curse.” People will talk like that and when it comes to their own daughters' wedding, they will not go beyond their caste! “Caste system is bad.” “Your religion is bad, this is bad, that bad,” but when it comes to actual understanding of religion you can easily scratch them [beneath the surface] and find out from where they come.

Worst of all the conditioning is, of so-called religions! And this has to be broken completely because they are all false, [but] based on something solid. Supposing you have a very solid foundation, on that you put up a house of, say, pack of cards, as they say. How long it is going to last? If you go to the foundations you find all the foundations are just the same but this pack of cards are different. And they are the greatest delusions for human beings which we are seeing every day, in every religion, in every country, in every caste. But still we are frightened of something nonsensical, something historical or I don't know what. We don't want to give up that.

That’s another very big binding force to very low-grade life. I mean, say two caste people meet, same people, how do they talk? “Oh! So, you are of the same caste?” He says, “Yes I am.” “Then you must be knowing this man,” “Yes, yes. He’s my father’s, brother’s, this thing’s, this thing.” In Marathi, they’d say “sakhaa”. “Sakyatla sakhaa”. “Manje kai?” [Marathi, “Means what?”]. Like that. “Oh, so, you are the cousin’s, sister’s, this thing, that thing, real husband!” [Laughter]
And such terrible talks! I don’t know, they go on for hours together. And then I don’t know what is the satisfaction out of it. Then ultimately, they find out sometimes, or mostly, that both of them are related to a dacoit (armed thief) or to a thug or some sort of a bankrupt or some sort of a horrible man. And there they recede back. Then they don’t want to show any relationship.

So, this kind of a nonsensical talks, for example, if the ladies meet, “Oh,” they will say, “Where did you buy this sari?” “I bought it there.” “Oh, I went there. How much you paid?” She said, “This [much]” Such waste of time goes on and on and on and on and on. The whole life is wasted in such a low-grade understanding of life's value.

Then they will also talk ill [of others], do this - I mean you can build up on that all the filth. It's something like the fungus growing. From the dead, with little heat the fungus starts growing, mutation takes place, and the fungus becomes then aggressive, can become cancerous, this, that. In the same way, all this low-grade life starts. Then this low-grade life can extend in every walk of life, like politics, economics, everywhere, because it is like plastic. Plastic can get into cloth, can get into trees, can get into everything. In the same way this horrible low-grade business goes into these various things and a person cannot rise above this built-in plastic bondages we have.

At this time when we have such kind of programmes, everything breaks off and you really dissolve into the love of God. There are so many other mundane things if you see how people talk, how they joke and all that.You will think it’s all filth going round you. Slowly you will gradually recede from it. That is how you prepare yourself for retaining this joy within yourself.

Now we are coming to the fag-end of our tours and when you will be going to your countries you should see for yourself what's happening around and just laugh and get out of it. You have to remember those beautiful days of Ganapatipule and you have to get into that mood and know that you belong to the Kingdom of God. I know we had very little time to talk but music was even better.

I could communicate better through music to you. I’m working on you all the time but still there are some people who are caught up. I would request you, for all the leaders who find out there are any caught up people in their groups - please don't call them for the pujas. They should be kept back if you think they are not all right. And they should not also feel bad because they will be helped much more if they don't come to the puja.

So, tomorrow is going to be the great day for our puja. I hope it will be convenient for all of you to come and be seated here. I think tomorrow, before coming to the puja don't talk too much and don't discuss too much. I think you must have had enough discussions today and have reached some conclusions. I would like to know if some questions were not answered. If there is any- I would like to answer them now and after that we’ll start our programme. For about five minutes, are sufficient for answering.

All questions were answered? Is there any question that was not answered? Please stand up, I can't see if there is anybody. Oh, oh! That's Sahaj! Sahaj people have no questions. They have to only answer.

All right. Now, local people want to garland Me here.

[Speeches of two Indians senior Sahaja Yogis]

Shri Mataji: No doubt, we have to be very, very thankful to the residents of Malgund village. But I think one has to learn a lot from them. You wouldn't find anywhere a place like this, where people are that generous and so kind the way they have accommodated you. And also that they have tried to be so cooperative and kind to these guests, who are really outnumbering all the rest of the people here. It's really very surprising. And I feel extremely grateful to them.

This kind of generous, kind, compassionate relationship with the guests is only possible perhaps because it is a place blessed by Shri Ganesha, the Maha Ganesha. Otherwise, I cannot imagine that in any country in the whole world, we could find some place with such beautiful people who would do so much for us.
[Applause]

As the luck would have it, I have at least five plans for development of Konkan area. I always had a very great affection for Sane Guruji. He's a person who will make you weep when you read him. It's tremendous. And I have read all his books many a times.

Then we have a great person like Bal Gangadhar Tilak whose name you must have heard. A great man, a great orator, and who said that, "Freedom is my birthright ", in the court where he was arrested. Such a brave person he was!

Keshavsut, of course, is a very well-known poet and a great Realized soul, a saint born in this area. So, I always had a special feeling for Konkan, so much so that my husband was in the committee of Konkan development. And he built a road, they built this first road, this Goa road. When it was in a very bad shape, I came here. My brother got engaged in the village of Pali. I remember, at that time, I said, "This Konkan has to develop”. It has to develop and it's such a beautiful area, which with little understanding and with little effort, through Sahaja Yoga we can develop a lot. And I'm going to see somebody very important within two, three days, to discuss with him how we can really develop this area and help them out to get to better economic conditions. But-
[Applause]

But the foremost thing, for any place to be developed, according to Me, should be Sahaja Yoga. If there is no Sahaja Yoga, and if you develop that place, then it goes to waste. People take to bad things: they take to drinking, they take to drugs, they take to bad morality. And this is the experience of many people who tried to develop things like Warana. In Warana, the gentleman who came to Me, who has developed that place, old gentleman, he wept and he said, "Mother I have committed a sin by giving so much of economic help to these people, to raise them higher. Because they have become very bad people now".

So, it is important that Sahaja Yoga must be established first. Once the Sahaja Yoga is established, then you do what you like, you enjoy whatever you earn, and you live in a proper way like in Ramaraji. That's why I was insisting that a ‘dhanakendra’ [unsure] must be started in Malgund. And I hope the residents won't mind my obstinacy about it.
Thank you very much.
[Applause]

Let us get to the main program. Because afterwards I think, the whole night I'll be distributing presents and presents and presents. So now as it is 7:30 - I shouldn't see the time as I told you.
[Laughter]
It gives you a headache! [Laughter]

And now we have a great artist from Delhi, Debu Chaudhuri [sitar player].
Sahaja Yogis: Ah!
[Applause]

And you all have been waiting to listen to him. And he has very kindly agreed to play to us for about 2 hours or 1 and a half hour. Then I was thinking we have to distribute lots of things to people. By tons you have brought! So, that, I have to do.

Before that, before we start this program, there's some things that the foreign Sahaja Yogis have to collect from us: the puja saris and other things. So, I would request the leaders to come down and take their saris which I have already touched. And you can take them.

Now also, there are some bracelets which are to be given to people who haven't got the bracelets. So those leaders who haven't got the bracelets should come and pick up. And if some people want some extra, they can take it from here, which I have got it here. That's all for the time being. And then we'll arrange for the music program.

Just keep it there. They can be taken down there. On there, just in front of that.
