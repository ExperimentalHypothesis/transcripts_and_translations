"There are so many here, I've seen so many. Such strange people I met on the streets, such strange people. There are so many. I mean, I do not know what is the percentage of lunatics in this country. But schizophrenic and all sorts of people, you can't say. I mean, every third person I came across had some sort of funny things going on in his head. I said, 'Now what is it?'

This is the country which is invaded the most by these negative forces. And if you are going to be destroyed, you are going to be destroyed from inside not from outside. You will not be destroyed from outside, take it from Me. You will be destroyed from inside and that you can see. What's happening -all kinds of destructive forces are working it out. And the worst of all is horrible gurus who have come from India. You people had invasion on India. English had their political invasion. You had your monetary invasion on India. So all these horrible people are having a mental invasion on you. You are not aware of it. It's a mental invasion on, very subtle mental invasion which you can not discern. You are enslaved, as we were enslaved by you for money.

You see for wheat, if they sent horrible wheat to India, Americans used to say 'Hey oh, we've been very gracious'. And the wheat was so horrible that we could not eat. We threw it on the ground. Imagine we threw it on the ground and horrible types of, what you call, acacia plants grew. We can not destroy them. And then another type of grass --which we call as 'congress grass', you see, because it came from America we call it 'congress grass'--, grew all over it, covered all over crops and everything. And we, we did not know why you were so kind to us to send all these. Somehow it was destroyed then this grass but still this horrible acacia is covering all the villages in India.

People are having a terrible time, they are poisonous. And if they hit you, you see, you are killed. Children play around, is a very dangerous thing. I mean, if they wanted to send wheat, they've should have been something more gracious than what they have been doing. This is how you have been very very unpopular all over the world.

Whenever you try to help anyone, you think 'Oh, you are [UNCLEAR good/great], doing too much'. While India has helped you in so many ways. First of all, it has helped you when you had wars, we send Indian troops and all that all over, we never tried to show anything like that. You see, it is surprising how these developed nations are so ego oriented, so ego oriented. I mean, so many things they have done that I can not understand how human beings are not afraid of God and His wrath that can come on us. We have oppressed all the people who are already oppressed. We have tried to really [UNCLEAR clutch/crush] them down.

Now it is for time being for you people who are born in this country, who are special people born, you are very very special. In America we have the maximum number of [UNCLEAR], you would not know. It is for you to rise above all these nonsensical things and get over it and join your hands in solving the problems of this wordly thing which has really oppressed the whole universe.

And I really depended very much on you people. I came nine years back but I found that the aggression is still bubbling in. They can not see things. And that's how these gurus take advantage of it. They took advantage of it. They came here, 'Alright, you've got money, pamper your ego you can purchase us'. They pampered your ego, you thought you can pay for them, you paid for them and what did you get out of it? Is nothing but all these horrible things out of which it is very difficult to get out. Apart from that, many might have lost the chances of self-realization. You are absolutely special people to be born, you have taken birth in this country with a very very special purpose. Because I told you that you are born in this place (Shri Mataji points to Vishuddhi Chakra on the chart). This is America. What a place!

I mean, you had great people like Abraham Lincoln, great people like him. What a man he was in life. You've have forgotten him completely, his ideals and things. I mean, what a man is Abraham Lincoln. I mean, If I read about anyone in the beginning, was Abraham Lincoln. I said, 'Look at him!' He was a realized soul, his ideas and all that are all of. Now it is for you to establish for what you have stood, for what God has created this America, this Chakra of Vishuddhi. And this is what is starting from here (Shri Mataji points to Nabhi Chakra on the chart) that you rise up to there (Shri Mataji points to Vishuddhi Chakra on the chart)."
