Draft Transcript 

There are so many here, I've seen so many. Such strange people I met on the streets, such strange people. There are so many. I mean, I do not know what is the percentage of lunatics in this country. But schizophrenic and all sorts of people, you can't say. I mean, every third person I came across had some sort of funny things going on in his head. I said, 'Now what is it?'

This is the country which is invaded the most by these negative forces. And if you are going to be destroyed, you are going to be destroyed from inside not from outside. You will not be destroyed from outside, take it from Me. You will be destroyed from inside and that you can see. What's happening -all kinds of destructive forces are working it out. And the worst of all is horrible gurus who have come from India. You people had invasion on India. English had their political invasion. You had your monetary invasion on India. So all these horrible people are having a mental invasion on you. You are not aware of it. It's a mental invasion on, very subtle mental invasion which you can not discern. You are enslaved, as we were enslaved by you for money.

You see for wheat, if they sent horrible wheat to India, Americans used to say 'Hey oh, we've been very gracious'. And the wheat was so horrible that we could not eat. We threw it on the ground. Imagine we threw it on the ground and horrible types of, what you call, acacia plants grew. We can not destroy them. And then another type of grass --which we call as 'congress grass', you see, because it came from America we call it 'congress grass'--, grew all over it, covered all over crops and everything. And we, we did not know why you were so kind to us to send all these. Somehow it was destroyed then this grass but still this horrible acacia is covering all the villages in India.

People are having a terrible time, they are poisonous. And if they hit you, you see, you are killed. Children play around, is a very dangerous thing. I mean, if they wanted to send wheat, they've should have been something more gracious than what they have been doing. This is how you have been very very unpopular all over the world.

Whenever you try to help anyone, you think 'Oh, you are [UNCLEAR good/great], doing too much'. While India has helped you in so many ways. First of all, it has helped you when you had wars, we send Indian troops and all that all over, we never tried to show anything like that. You see, it is surprising how these developed nations are so ego oriented, so ego oriented. I mean, so many things they have done that I can not understand how human beings are not afraid of God and His wrath that can come on us. We have oppressed all the people who are already oppressed. We have tried to really [UNCLEAR clutch/crush] them down.

Now it is for time being for you people who are born in this country, who are special people born, you are very very special. In America we have the maximum number of [UNCLEAR], you would not know. It is for you to rise above all these nonsensical things and get over it and join your hands in solving the problems of this wordly thing which has really oppressed the whole universe.

And I really depended very much on you people. I came nine years back but I found that the aggression is still bubbling in. They can not see things. And that's how these gurus take advantage of it. They took advantage of it. They came here, 'Alright, you've got money, pamper your ego you can purchase us'. They pampered your ego, you thought you can pay for them, you paid for them and what did you get out of it? Is nothing but all these horrible things out of which it is very difficult to get out. Apart from that, many might have lost the chances of self-realization. You are absolutely special people to be born, you have taken birth in this country with a very very special purpose. Because I told you that you are born in this place (Shri Mataji points to Vishuddhi Chakra on the chart). This is America. What a place!

I mean, you had great people like Abraham Lincoln, great people like him. What a man he was in life. You've have forgotten him completely, his ideals and things. I mean, what a man is Abraham Lincoln. I mean, If I read about anyone in the beginning, was Abraham Lincoln. I said, 'Look at him!' He was a realized soul, his ideas and all that are all of. Now it is for you to establish for what you have stood, for what God has created this America, this Chakra of Vishuddhi. And this is what is starting from here (Shri Mataji points to Nabhi Chakra on the chart) that you rise up to there (Shri Mataji points to Vishuddhi Chakra on the chart).

(25:15) This one is the first chakra called as Mooladhara chakra. Now the word ‘Mooladhara’ – ‘Moola’ means the root. ‘Adhara’ means the support. So this is the support of the root. The root is his – Kundalini. And this is the support of the Kundalini. And this is the chakra which is bestowed upon by a deity called Shri Ganesha who is the embodiment of innocence. It is the same deity borne at this time as Christ. No one should know that this chakra in the gross controls the Pelvic Plexus. I don’t know how many of you doctors here. But Pelvic Plexus also have sub-plexus which are four in number and they control all our excretory functions including sex. Now if you see it clearly it is placed below the Kundalini because it’s the innocence. In the mud of excretion is put the innocence because He is innocent. A child doesn’t understand sex isn’t it. He is the eternal child. Ganesha ist he eternal child. Christ is the eternal innocence. He doesn’t understand sex nor can He marry […] – all these ideas of Christ marry (allusion to nuns), I mean, how can you marry a little child. He doesn’t develop ego or superego like human beings do and that’s why the head of the child is that of an elephant. Because elephant is a very wise animal and there is a story about it, but that I will tell you later on. (27:12)

(39:50) Now, one can say, there is only one God. Yes, there is only one God. No doubt, there is only one God, there are not many Gods. But God, He is one, has many aspects. Like you can be a doctor, you can be a husband, you can be a father, you could be a son. Now, you can say there is only one man. God is not like Rock of Gibraltar that He has no other aspects. But even Rock of Gibraltar if you go and […] it has got different cells of which it’s made. So God has different aspects and in this different aspects He acts different. There is only one God who does this but His aspects are different. The first aspect of God is the desire of God that He wants to create. This desire is represented by this power of His. The another aspect of God is here by which He creates, He acts and He is the creator on this side. Now the central one is the aspect of God which He is the father, which is the one which tries to evolve, improve His image on the reflectors that He has created. These are the three functions and three aspects of God. Now this aspect is the aspect of the spirit, here we say, because is the one that the spirit exists all the time. It is changeless, it is eternal and it does not incarnate, in the sense that, that aspect which is the aspect of a witness does not incarnate. That’s the God almighty we can say, it’s called as Sadashiva in Sanskrit language. This aspect of God does not incarnate. He never incarnates but His power is the Adi Shakti, is the primordial mother, is the primordial power, the primordial Shakti, is the one that creates this whole thing. She first creates the left side and then the right side and then the central side. These are the three powers this primordial power has got. And then She puts this Kundalini down there, when you become a human being it rises and makes you aware of that all pervading power which is this cool breeze which you start feeling. So the witness stays in the heart, the witness is the spirit. He is Sat-Chit-Ananda, means He is the truth, He is the attention and He is the joy. (42:35)


(46:14) Imagine, this centres are built within us with our evolution. This is the centre of when we where just carbon (Mooladhara chakra) up to carbon point. Carbon also is tetravalent. This is also tetravalent. Till we were carbon. Carbon is a very (.. sounds like ‘divitl’)… element in all the elements if you see the position of carbon. Because when carbon started then only life started come in. This is how we are here up to the carbon point. After that we become human beings we start … live, then we start growing here. Now we grew into seven stages. We grew into say definitely we say then stages out of witch eight stages brought us up to human level.

Now, as I told you, this is the centre of creativity, means it creates all the stars and everything within us. It creates all the galaxies and all those things within us and is also responsible for looking after our left side psyche and the right side creativity. So if there is an artist with us. He comes to us, we’ll find his right side Swadisthana – this is the Swadisthana […] you can see there. Immediately we’ll find that he is an artist. Immediately you will find that he is giving you hot vibrations on this part, means he is an artist or maybe he has used it too much, a person who is a speaker or a writer and all that, who has used his creative power too much on the right hand side gives you this pain.

The one who has used the left side psyche, like people who have been tampered with their psyche. You see a psychologist, a person who is a psychologist, who is studying psychology. I mean psychology can not be studied by people who are not realized souls. They should not. They do not know how they are harmed by tampering with other psyche. They do not know how to protect themselves. For a doctor may try up something to say himself about infections but a psychologist does not know how he is harmed. Even if you live with a mad person or if you go to a lunatic asylum you will catch from them. That’s how your left side gets caught up and you find that left side starts working in such a manner that you develop all left side problems. Left side problems are depression, epilepsy, leading to all kinds of modern pressures as they call it, guilt and diffidence, suicide, could be lunacy, all those things come from your left side and last of all – cancer. Cancer is caused by the left side problem and not by the right side problem. Actually as the reaction of the right side, if you are too active – you are too active all the time you are thinking, because this centre does another very important work. It changes, transforms your fat into the cells for the use of your brain which is using it for thinking.

So it goes into tremendous action when you start planning. I mean here I have seen people plan too much till they say all [… sounds like ‘set’]. You see, you start from the home, you start planning. There is no need to plan, I don’t understand, what is the need to plan to that extend? I mean you are going on the road, there is no need to plan at all! You have to work it out at the present moment. For example supposing I have to book a ticket. Then that is to be done today. Then what is the planning? That on the eight I will book. What is the need to say that before hand I mean it will come to eight to book it? But you go on at this and ultimately all plans fail. Everything fails. You go to a place for example, you don’t know. If you say all right we’ll go to the right. But maybe there is no road on the right so are you going to fall into the ditch because you have planned in forehand that I will go to the right. You must leave it open! And the same about Kundlaini. Because when the Kundalini rises its like a car which has started. It moves, it moves, it moves. Supposing it has start here and somebody gives you a mantra for this one. You will spoil this one as well as this is already spoiled. So you’ll have a double problem because you are saying mantra for this one. Of course any mantra you say, you spoil this in any case.

Apart from that you have no connection, nothing you are not yet realized soul and you are taking somebody’s name like that. For example Ramas mantra – is Rama is here. Any people say Ramas mantra they have problems with this. They can get asthma – physically. ‚Ahh, I’m saying Ramas mantra but I have got [? ambiguous] (Mother said it with very exhausted voice). What else, I mean you must get it if you have asthma I’ll ask you ‘did you say Ramas mantra in India?’ Absolutely is those hand in hand because Rama is stationed here, all right! Now, if you have to take His name there should be some protocol. What is your authority? Why are you are taking Ramas name? Supposing I start taking the name of your president in his house, go there and start shouting: ‘Oh president, president!’, whatever his name is, I start shouting his name. I’ll be arrested or not? Or maybe at that time when you are shouting Ramas name – maybe some servant with the name of Rama who has died will feel that ‘there is a call for me’, will come and enter into your being. Mostly it happens, because you have no connection with Rama Himself. With Shri Rama you have no connection. To some Rama who is working in your house and has died or someone with that thing or maybe around somewhere in the atmosphere this busy bodies. Anybody can enter in you and you can get possessed and you can be a disaster. This right side problem is very common with people who are suffering from this trouble. And this trouble comes to you because you try to be very individualistic. Like if you are married you don’t want to create good relationship… - Can you ask him to go down, he is distracting everyone. All right. Can you ask him to come to the day after tomorrow to our place. Here we will treat him. All right? You can sit there also. I’ll cure him tomorrow or after the program I’ll try. It’s moving. The thing is moving in him, you see, from places to places and one has to […] it.

There are so many here. I have seen so many, such strange people I have met, on the streets. Such strange people. There are so many, I mean - I don’t know how is the percentage of lunatics in this country. But schizophrenic and all sorts of people, I mean you can’t say, I mean - just see every third person I came across have some sort of a funny thing going on in his head. I say ‘now, what is it? This is the country which is invaded the most by this negative forces. And if you are going to be destroyed you are going to be destroyed from inside not from outside. You will not be destroyed from outside. Take it from Me. You will be destroyed from inside and that you can see what’s happening. All kinds of destructive forces are working it out and the worst of all are these horrible gurus who have come from India. You people had invasion on India in [… ambiguous] – their political invasion, you had your monetary invasion on India. So all this horrible people are having a mental invasion on you. You are not aware of it. It’s a mental invasion on you. A very subtle mental invasion which you cannot discern. You are enslaved as we were enslaved by you for money. You see for wheat, they send horrible wheat to India. Americans use to say ‘Eeoh, we have been very gracious’. The wheat was so horrible that we could not eat. We threw it on the ground, imagine, threw it on the ground and horrible types of – what you call – acacia plants grew. You cannot destroy them and then another type of grass which we call as congress-grass, you see – because it came from America we call it congress-grass grew all over and it covered all over, crops and everything and we didn’t know why were you so kind to us to send all this things. Somehow it was destroyed then, this grass but still this horrible acacia is covering all the villages in India.

People having a terrible time. They are poisonous and if they hit you, you see, you are killed. The children play around. It’s a very dangerous thing. I mean if they wanted to send wheat they should have been something more gracious than what they have been doing. This is how you have been very, very unpopular all over the world. When ever you try to help anyone you think: ‘Oh your are [? ambiguous] being too much, while India has helped you in so many ways. First of all it has helped you when you had wars. We sent Indian troops and all that all over. You never try to show anything like that. You see, it’s surprising how this developed nations are so ego-oriented? So ego-oriented! I mean so many things they have done that I cannot understand how human beings are not afraid of God and His wrath that can come on us. We have oppressed all the people who are already oppressed. We have tried to really class them down. Now, it is for you people who are born in this country, who are special people born. You are very, very special. In America we have the maximum number of saints. You would not know, it is for you to rise above all this nonsensical things. And get over it and join your hands in solving the problems of these worldly things which has really oppressed the whole universe. I really depended very much on you people I came nine years back but I found that the aggression is still bubbling in. They cannot see things and that’s how these gurus take advantage of it. They took advantage of it. They came here. ‘All right, you have got money! Pamper your ego you can purchase us.’ They pamper your ego, you thought you can pay for them. You pay for them. What did you get out of it? It is nothing but all this horrible things out of which is very difficult to get out. Apart from that many might have lost their chances of self-realization.

(57:00) You are absolutely special people to be born. You have taken birth this country with a very, very special purpose, because I told you, you are born on this place, this is America. What a place it is. I mean, you have great people like Abraham Lincoln. Great people like him, what a man he was you have. You have forgotten him completely his ideals and things, I mean what a man he […]. I mean if I read about anyone in the beginning was Abraham Lincoln. I said: ‘Look at him’. He was a realized soul. He’s ideas and all that are gone off. Now it is for you to establish for what you have stood. For what God has created this America, this Chakra of Vishuddhi. And this is what we starting from here and rise up to there. The connection is that this seeking goes in developing and there are ten principles which are described as the ten commandment’s you can say or we have got ten sutras.

In Sanskrit language they are called as ten sutras. Ghandiji put one more by saying that we should use only Indian things not foreign things because then they will dominate us. So he put ekadesha (11), he put one more, but there are ten which are here, which are described as the ten commandment’s in the bible. And these are the ten primordial masters who were born on earth. Say we can start from Socrates, then we can think of other, in India was Dattatreya. Dattatreya is the essence and He is born as Socrates. He is born as Laotse, He is born as Abraham and Moses. He is born as – up till now we can say Mohammed Sabh, Nanaka, latest is the Sai Nath of Shirdi. He is the one who represents, they all represent this primordial masterprinciple of religion. Religon menas the one which sustains us. These ten are our sustenance, we can say our valencies, is our quality, like this gold has a quality that is untarnishable. In the same way this human beings have this ten qualities in them. For a dog doesn’t know what is truth and what is untruth. Dog doesn’t know what is violence and non-violence. It is the human beings which know this ten things and these are the ten qualities which are sustained by the primordial master who is Dattatreya, who has incarnated on this earth basically ten times. But there are so many upa-gurus as they called, the subsequent gurus also who are realized souls.

Now, at the time of Christ (was it) John the baptist. He was a real baptist he was not a [sounds like antru-baptist]. He was a realized soul. Nowadays everybody is a baptist, without being the real baptist You have to be a real baptist. When you are a realized soul only then you are a real baptist not before that. And this special thing called as the primordial master is also within you. You can become your own guru. Your guru-principle is to be awakened. If the Kundalini awakens your guru-principle you become the guru. You have to become your own guru.

On the left side is the diffidence (1:0049) that you can not be a guru. On the right side is the arrogance. And that’s how sometimes we subject ourself’s to others saying, ‘that you are my guru!’ And here we are arrogant, when we see a real guru, we deny. So this two sides are to be seen and once you work it out – for example this gentleman who was here has a left side. Is the diffidence in him – please come here [Shri Mataji addresses someone] – so the left side is the one that gives you the diffidence and you subject yourself to other gurus and you can see it on your left side void. This is the void. You can feel it on the left side void, a burning sensation and this is s sign that you have been to some guru who has not a realized soul, who is a wrong type of man. Immediately you can make out from the person whether he has been to a right type of guru or a bad one. If you have been to the right type you get your realization just like that. You are just […] for it. He doesn’t spoil your chakras, nothing. He don’t give you false ideas. You are just ready but he has done very great work is to establish this part in you. That’s why Moses, Abraham all of them talked about alcoholism, about these things because alcohol spoils the liver.

Christ did not, He was born at that time He talked about the eyes. He talked about the realization. He talked about the door and that’s why He has said you must get your resurrection. So the different aspects came at different time and this aspect of the primordial master which was Moses, you can say Abraham and other people of the same type who came to establish balance and dharma within us. Here they have not shown two other subsidiary chakras. One is the chakra of the sun, another is of the moon. This is the moon-line and this is the sun-line. Now, this centre they should have shown here I think, which means that when you are on the sunline you become right-handed. Right-handed means you are more projecting towards the future, you are thinking too much or you are putting too much attention to your physical being and not your spirit, not to your emotional senses. Now when you start getting to asceticism and all sorts of nonsense like that, become an ascetic, give up this, give up that, give up that and you give up actually your brains, nothing else. You become a thin person, if you start moving like this then get a horrible liver. See, is liver make stand up for this.

Now, liver is one of the very, very special organs we have got within ourselves. I mean you would not know if you have a bad liver till you get to cirrhosis. There they will say: ‘Now, last time has come, you will arrange for your funeral.’ That’s what it is. Liver is like that, it goes on little bad, bad, bad till you do not know. But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you will know that you have a liver problem and you’ll know also how to cure it. And liver is responsible for our attention which is so important. If your liver is not al right your attention will be horrid. All the time you will be feeling sick, frustrated, embittered, you wouldn’t like this, you wouldn’t like that. Sort of a person always annoyed and you would not know why I do like this. I don’t want to do it but why I’m doing like that? So this is the one, one has to look after. But when you think too much as I told you – this and this centre of Swadisthana which is bestowed upon by Brahmadeva who is the creator, works too hard and it has no time to look after the other things like the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys and the uterus. So these things get completely neglected. And that’s how the people who think too much always get diabetes. See, in Sahaja Yoga diabetes is curable. […] and all those things […] and all this things and cause of the saint. Such people can become so very dry, very, very dry, because their left side goes absolutely out of order. It is sleeping. They become emotionless. I have known people they came to tell Me: ‘Mother, I have no emotions now, I have become a great saint. I have no emotions.’ Who has told you? I mean a saint has such emotions you can’t […]. It’s such a feeling. I mean if somebody says that he is a saint and he has no emotions you throw him in the see. He is good for nothing. A person who has no emotions is not a human being. He is worse than an animal. And if you see [short disorder of the record] is only this. That if you feel pain then you start weeping and becoming emotional. But a saint is the other way round. When he sees others in pain, being the compassion, feels […].When he sees others in trouble, when he sees others drowning then the compassion starts flowing from his eyes and you can see the compassion from those eyes. Absolutely the same terrific eyes become so compassionate that you are surprised that how this love is flowing. And at the same time he can take a hunter in his hand and hit people. At the same time he can be very wrathful with people who try to destroy the saints. He can be extremely wrathful and he can be very, very dynamic. He can be anything but he uses is for the purpose of one thing. Is to save the saints and to make them the spirit. (1:06:40)
