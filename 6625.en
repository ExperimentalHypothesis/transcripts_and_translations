Seminar in Old Arlesford 1980 (England), 17 May 1980.

Face yourself for becoming. Then the preparation is done to become something and on the whole, when you know that it is your ego and superego which are loading you up, you have to scan them out with vibratory awareness.

Now there are two types of attention we have to pay. First is a constant attention that is a routine of a Sahaja Yogi, and the second one is the emergency attention.I have been saying that all the Sahaja Yogis must start writing their diaries: one with every day’s experiences, if you know that you have to write a diary, you’ll keep your mind alert, and another one whenever you get any special idea of the past or of the future, also to jot it down. So, like that, you should have two diaries.

For your constant attention, you have to fix up your mind on certain pegs. The first one, as I said, that if you keep a diary then you will know that you have to remember what important things have happened. So your attention will be alert and you will be looking out for such points, where, what is the thing you see. And you’ll be amazed, if you make your attention alert, what new things come to you – very brilliant ideas. And the miracles of life and the miracles of God’s beauty and His auspiciousness, His greatness, His kindness, His blessings – how they work out if you start writing every day even two lines about it. It will make your mind constantly involved with it. That’s a human style of doing things.Also you can mention in the diary what happened: did you, could you do your meditation? Did you get your time for meditation or not? A little bit as if you are appearing for some sort of a examination or something, you prepare a little note like that: “Did I get up in the morning? Did I?” Then any special path or any special movement in the centre or left or right also should be mentioned so that you keep a watch on your mind. It’s a very good thing to maintain a diary.

Also, you will see progressively how your ideas are changing, how new priorities are settling down, how you give more importance to real things and very little to unreal things. I think this is a very, very practical side of human beings that one should have a diary. [The] same diaries, after some times, will become historical things and people would like to see what you all have written. Not to be hypocritical about it or deceptive about it, but quite truthful and understanding. You should jot down few lines just before sleeping.

Now we have to see that we have problems for superego and ego. Now superego is the left side, is darkness, tamo guna and our past. Those who have left side problems should think of the future, it gives them balancing if they think of the future. For example, a person who is lethargic should take to working. Put your mind into working for the future planning: what to do, where to go, how to do. That will keep you away from [the] drag of the left side and gradually then you can balance yourself also.

Now the right side of a person, when it is activated very much, he has to balance it not with the left side but with the centre. That is, a person who is very hard-working must develop a witness state. You try to do a work, any work, indulge into work in thoughtless awareness, as a witness. Whatever work you are doing you just say that: “I am not doing it.” This you can do it after Realisation. You become thoughtlessly aware and start doing your work.So the compensation of the left side is done by movement to the right, and of the right side [by] movement in the centre. Left side is the tamo guna, right side is the rajo guna, the centre is the sattwo guna. But still these are three gunas. That’s not the state which we have to achieve. About this I’ll tell you tomorrow more, how to go further then.After scanning out which side is weak, you should plan out your style of life.

For example, if you are extremely lethargic, you cannot get up in the morning, you feel very sleepy in the night, you do not feel alerted then start planning as to what will you do. How will you get up? Even puja is a good idea, homa (havan) is a good idea. Do something like that, so that you have to do something, what you call the kriya, is the action, get into the action. Some sort of a action you go into in Sahaja Yoga as well as in your daily life [then] you’ll be able to change that mood and come to the right side and then you’ll go to the, your movement should be towards the sattwa guna, is to watch everything.

Now at the sattwa guna point where you are in the centre you have to see how much you are misidentified. Say, supposing you are at the first stage of left side, then you will just do daydreaming, “‘Oh! This person is so much identified, that one is so much identified,” as if you are the best. It’s just human nature, you see. “Oh, that person is like that, he is like that, this is very bad in the society, that is going bad in the society. It’s better...” Then we can also go to this limit is to, “That guru is very bad and that one is another madcap.” Like that, you see, all daydreaming going on. How far it is affecting you, how far are you improving by that is not....It’s just, you see, thinking, analysing. It is, it’s a lazy stuff, sitting down and just analysing, it’s a lazy stuff.

The second thing could be when you come to the second side of it, is the kriya. Then what happens when you start doing it, then at least your attention is on what you are doing. It’s not allowed to drift into something and which goes into any nonsense and can, I mean, then you don’t know from where the funny thoughts are coming. So, you start doing something. You can go and plant some trees or you can go and plant some flowers or if you want you can do some cooking, you can do some work.Take to work! That will help you. Any work. But while doing the work the problem will be, you’ll develop ego. That’s why when you are developing the ego you have to tell yourself, “You are not doing, mister! This you are not doing, this is not doing, you are not doing.” If you go on suggesting to yourself [like this] Mr. Ego will not come up. And then many things, you see, which normally trouble you and trouble others – like you have cleaned the room, alright. Then [if] somebody comes and spoils it you get angry with that person. Naturally! Because you think ‘you’ have done. First of all you don’t clean the room. If you clean the room then you be prepared, it will be dirtied, otherwise why should you clean? Now, if it is dirty, well and good; if it is not dirtied, well and good.

This type of a attitude you should take to jump on to sattwa guna. On sattwa guna you start accepting it. You become extremely mild. You become a mild personality. Then at that time you do not discuss as to, “Oh, I don’t like it; this was wrong; this should not have been.” All these things do not come to you in sattwa guna. You start seeing it. That time you see it that, “Alright, doesn’t matter. It’s done, it’s done.”

On the contrary, you feel hurt if you are a sattwa guni, that by any suggestion you have suggested your ego. Can you get that point? You feel ashamed of your ego, I mean to say, if you are a sattwa guni. For example, even to say that “This is my car,” you will feel shy. That’s a sattwa guni type. Or even to say, “Why did you spoil my carpet?” I mean in India nobody will say, I can tell you this! Is regarded [as] bad manners, absolute bad manners. If anybody comes to your house and the carpet is spoiled they say, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.” Even it is burnt, “I don’t know. Let it be. Are you burnt?” They’ll never say that, “You have burnt my carpet, or done anything to my...” Is regarded [as] bad manners.

Like here, you see, if somebody’s sleeping [and] somebody makes the noise. The person who is sleeping will never say that “You are making noise,” He’ll just get up and ask, “Do you need anything?” That’s difficult for people here to understand because ego is just sitting on the head. But is bad manners there. You will find when you’ll go to India you’ll find this. These are bad manners to say that. Or to say, “Oh, I, I feel very comfortable.” I mean, to say “I feel comfortable” is bad manners. I mean, they never say. “I like it.” So what? All these words are not to be said. If you are a sattwa guni then you just don’t say, you will say, “Do you like it? Is it comfortable? Would you like to have this?” The whole attention goes from your side. Do you understand that?That is the style one has to develop. Then you are a sattwa guni. Otherwise, you are still on ego trip. You see, whatever you may think, “I don’t like that, I don’t...” “I”- who are you? First of all ask the question, “Who are you?” If God says, “I don’t like you,” I can understand, with good reasons, but for you to say, “I don’t like it” ...After all, how did you come on this earth? How did you get a human birth? How did you get all these things? Now think like that. “Who am I? I am nothing.” Anybody who thinks, “I am something,” he should know that he’s nothing; makes no difference to God whether he exists or does not exist, you see, he’s nothing, he’s just a drop.

So, this point if you understand, that even if you do something, any work you do or anything you are doing: you are just doing it because you want to do it. That is how you come on to sattwa guna. But normally it doesn’t happen. It happens the other way round. For example a person is, say, doing something [if] by any chance he feels hurt or he thinks that whatever he has done is no good. People don’t appreciate, or maybe he might think that, “Oh, it’s not up to the point,” or whatever it is, then the reaction for him is not that he does not try to rise to sattwa guna, but he goes back to tamo guna. “Alright, I’ll not do it. I’ll sleep over it. Let them do it, why should I do it?”

So the training that you have to have through your rajo guna goes a waste. It’s just a training period that you are with rajo guna. You are doing something. Now in that training period you have to learn only how to come in the centre. For example now, water is required for you to swim. If there is no water you cannot swim. All right? In the same way, rajo guna is required for you to come to sattwa guni. If you do not do any work you cannot come to sattwa guna. So you are just working just to train yourself to be a witness. Now do you follow that point? You are not doing it because you like particular thing, you are used to particular thing, because you want to be this. This is not the way it is. You are just doing it to learn how to be patient. To practice your patience. To see how much patient you are.

Once you start doing it, you’ll be amazed that you will never feel the burden of the work. But it never happens. Most of the people, if they find their work is not effective, they’ll go back to tamo guna. There are many attitudes. Say, somebody’s working, then he thinks, “Why should I do all the work? Others are not doing!” He’ll go back to their stage. But those who are not working will not think that, “This person is working, let me also work.” It’s other way round, you see. This can be an attitude of some people that “if this person is working, let him work.” This is even a meaner stuff, [to] avoid, just. You go to a restaurant and somebody takes out the purse, others start looking this side – is very mean, it’s a very mean thing to do. Everybody should come forward and once you have paid, you have paid it, finished.Then you just don’t start counting, “Why did I pay?” Once you try [to do this]. Or any work has to be done, go forward with it, do it with your heart. Don’t worry if others have not done it. Just do it for its pleasure and the pleasure only you will get when you will do it with the understanding that it’s a training period, you are better trained than the other one is. You are at a higher class than the other one is. So we have to be at a higher class. For that this is just a training on. And that’s how we can really put our preparation into practice, into all details to see how we work out our ego and superego.

Today, in the morning, I have told you that your intellect must imbibe this within itself, all right? And now I’m telling you that your action, action that you do, must be every time branded by you as just your training – any action you do. Supposing you have to drive for miles together, you are trying your patience. You see they’ll do in everything. Say they have to go for say helicopter, or say if they have to drop from the...what you call them, they drop down?Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.Shri Mataji: Parachuters! Or helicopter you take away or whatever it is. You go on doing it again and again, isn’t it? You practice it again and again. You drop many-a-times, you break your legs, you break your hands, you do this and do that till you become a master. You understand My point? Driving – same way, till you become a master, you go on. In the same way, you are doing this work just to master your patience.

And then your love, is your love – how much you love really. If you really love someone, you are never tired of working. You are never upset with work. But if you don’t love, you start counting, “How much money, how much work, how many hours, how much to be paid?” All artificiality comes because there is no love involved in your work. Whatever you don’t want to do, you don’t do it, to begin with. To begin with you just don’t do what you don’t like – to begin with. But once you have mastered that, then you have to master it that you do something that you don’t like. Like meeting some bhooties, for example. You don’t want to meet, you want to run away, but you go little nearer it, you see. Then develop a immunity for these bhooties. After some time you’ll not catch them. We have to develop the immunity, isn’t it? Otherwise one person comes here and everybody’s head goes out. Instead of the fellow improving, you all go out.

So all these things are, all these events are for your training, your immunity. Your immunity is to be trained and when it is so, when we are training ourselves we should take it as a job. But the attitude should be extremely positive, extremely positive and all that should be expressed in your notebook: whether you got dejected or you got upset and disgusted, you want to run away from it – all sorts of things. It’s just a training to your mind. Whatever is the situation, wherever one has to live, whatever one has to do, we should do. Whatever may be the circumstances, conditions, you’ll be amazed, you will not even know what you have eaten in the morning, what you have eaten in the evening, whether you have eaten or not you will not know. You’ll not fuss about it, you’ll not worry about it, you’ll not think about it. But this being, the aim, is to reach to sattwa guna, every other thing becomes zero.

It’s the greatest hurdle comes to Sahaja Yogis I’ve seen, when they start organising. They start organising something. Now somebody wants something, so they’ll run up to get the thing for that person. Now just now I’ve said that you must look after the needs of others, but if I am sitting here and there’s a lecture on then you’d better be just listening to Me. You see, this also is there that: how to have your priorities, at this time when something [is] working on you. This is the first thing you have to do. Not that at this time you go and cook. You have known the story of two sisters attending on Christ. Alright?So at this time, what is your first job is to try to be more exposed to Me so that automatically you’ll go into your sattwa guna. This is the best! But if I am not there and when you are alone or when you are with other Sahaja Yogis you must now compete in rising higher and higher: from tamo guna to rajo guna and from rajo guna to sattwo guna.

But actually by Realisation you have gone beyond these three gunas. You have gone beyond it. Actually that is what has happened to you. But, like clouds, they cover you again and again. And when the sky is covered with those clouds, you cannot see the sun, you cannot see the moon, you cannot see the stars. So we have to know how these clouds are coming into us and that’s how we go into our complete analysis. How these clouds are coming to us, you find out about our different chakras. What are the chakras we are catching? Here comes the another constant attention towards our chakras. Are our vibrations alright or not? Are we getting our vibrations? If not, what chakra am I catching, what must be the catch? I must raise my Kundalini, see for myself, where is the catch. Do I do my meditation or not? If I do it, am I doing it just dozingly or am I really in it? Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert or not?All this is to be assiduously, sincerely, absolutely, truthfully should be worked out. Because it is a process between your self – ‘Atamanyeva Atmana tushta’ [The Spirit is satisfied with Itself]. You see it’s a very funny, it is so funny relationship that it is the Atma is satisfied with Atma! You have to be satisfied with your Self. There’s nobody, Mataji is not concerned, nobody is concerned. It is you who is concerned with your Self.

For example, you ask somebody and he says, “I am like this, Mother.” Now think that you are Mother, one personality, another is, say, Mr. Don or Kingsley or someone X. You are two personalities. So when you are telling your Self, means that is Mataji, that, “I am not alright,” then Mataji must come up and say, “What do you mean by this? Why should you say like that? What’s wrong?” When you say that to your self which is outside, then the attention starts moving towards your Self which is Mataji and you start becoming that and you start seeing through your Atma. So your Atma is to be satisfied by your Atma only. There is nothing in between. It is you only in this dual personality has to satisfy your Self. One is in ignorance, one is in knowledge.

Now try to identify yourself with that Mataji, call it, or any Xyz whatever you call it, Atma. And just for, just a drama, say. You just think that you are the Self, Spirit. So how will you address your Self? Let’s see. Supposing you have to sit in My seat, yes, take it like that, a position. And then you are sitting in front of Me also, alright? So you are sitting here and sitting there. Take a position like that. Now you put up your Self in a drama and you start addressing your self, “So Bala, how are you?” so Bala says, “Better,”So if you are identified now with Mataji, gradually Bala will diminish, alright? But if you are still identified with Bala, he’ll grow and this [Mataji] will diminish. You have to try to address your self as if you are Mataji. It’s a drama. You sit before the mirror. In the mirror you see this outside of yours and here you are sitting, whatever you are, Mr. Don for example. Now Mr. Don is addressing the other Don there, and let him take up a role that, “I am the Spirit.” He’ll say, “I am the Spirit and I am eternal. I am this. Nobody can destroy me. I am above everything.” That thing will go down. “I am a realised soul. I know what Spirit is. What are you talking?” It will go down.

This is how you start moving. But is only possible that first you become a sattwa guni. If you are not a sattwa guni, with ego, “I am this,” then you become a guru and you start minting money!

First the ego is to be brought down. If there is still ego, then without becoming Atma you become an ego. So first this journey should be brought in to the centre of sattwa guna. That is why I say that when you are talking or doing anything, you must know that it is your Spirit which is doing it. That’s how you put your Spirit in charge or say at the pedestal – first stage.Then when the Spirit is there, then from this stage to that stage, then you say that, “Now I am the Spirit.” For example, if you have a prime minister and a deputy minister and a minister – three persons, alright? Now, if the prime minister is your Self and the minister has to become the prime minister, so he has to first become deputy minister. After becoming deputy minister he has to become prime minister; but deputy prime minister and then the prime minister. But supposing this fellow starts to jump over this, this will come up and hit him and he’ll say, “I’m the one!” and this one is E-G-O.Do you understand My point?

So you cannot surpass it. You have to merge this into this and then this into this. The movement has to be like that. But if you try to just become this, actually you will become this, not this, because you cannot become this. Do you understand My point?So, even when doing this exercise of sitting before a mirror and telling yourself that you are the Spirit, you are the part of Viraat, that you are the Ocean because your drop has fallen into the Ocean. Then you must know that your drop has fallen into the Ocean. That’s why you’ve become an Ocean. If that stage is missing, then you’re saying that you are an Ocean is absolutely bombastic. And that is why one has to be very steady and careful, absolutely steady as far as dealing with oneself. Because you know how this intelligence can cheat you.

So be very, very careful and when you are dealing with you, you must know that you have to first overcome this ego. The best thing to overcome ego is to change your language style, is to speak in the third person. Is a very good way. Like you must say, when you are talking about yourself, “This Mataji won’t listen to Me. This Mataji won’t do this,” you see, so what happens, this ‘Mataji’ means the ego part of it, you see. And once you start separating this Mataji away from your self, then that ego Mataji disappears. You understand?

Like you can say, “This Bala is like that. He won’t listen.” So whatever the real Bala is left in you is alright. That’s how you get rid of your ego and by understanding your centres, what you are catching, where you are catching, how you are catching; it would be very easy for you to get rid of your problems.

Now, see what Sahaja Yogis do. Supposing there are five Sahaja Yogis sitting. I mean you know that I know about everyone, everything. I don’t have to ask, “Where is catching?” Now why do I ask? I show complete ignorance. Because perhaps I never catch also, to be very frank. But if I want to know where I’m catching I can find out but I don’t want to. So what I say, “Alright, Chaya, tell Me where is he catching.” At this time one attitude could be that, “I must tell, otherwise Mataji won’t know.” This is very funny. (Laughter) The second one could be, and the second one could be that, that, “I know where she is catching and, and I must tell, and Mataji also knows but She wants to test me. So I should be careful.” At this point people make mistakes. If I ask them, “Where is it catching?” “I am catching on left heart but very mildly!” Finished then! You, you’ll get less marks. [Laughter]

You get less marks. You tell Me whatever you think, because at least you’re honest. Whatever you think. Supposing the fellow is not catching heart but you are feeling the heart. You say, “Heart” That’s being honest. Then I will tell you who is catching the heart. But if you are, “Perhaps yes, Mataji. No, Mataji,” then you get less marks. It’s not a very good answer. “I am not alright, I don’t know,” that’s not a good answer. You have to tell Me who is catching where. Then you pay more attention that you have to pass this test. This is just testing. Why? Because tomorrow you have to give Realisation. You have to become the gurus. You have to know all this. So this is all training period. I’m just training you by asking you to tell Me, but I have seen people even getting ego with this. It’s surprisingly sometimes. That also gives the ego to people that I say, “Alright, you tell Me where is he catching?” “I told correctly!” Finished!

You see, it is just a very, very, I can say, razor stage I tell you, where one has to see clearly. So be a simple person like children are. They just come. This one, that one, finished. Then they’ll go and sit down, “Now I’m tired , I’m sitting down!” They are not bothered that they should ... they must say something or something show off, nothing. Whatever they see, they say. But only grownups will say that, “Maybe I’m catching, maybe it is his. I don’t know.” All this is done by grownup people because still the sensitivity is alright but they are not sure of themselves. Children are very sure. They are cocksure of everything. You ask them anything, they’ll tell you, “Yes, this is this, this is this.” But you ask anyone, “What is the colour of this thing?” They’ll say, “Maybe green, maybe red.” [Laughter.]

Like we had one old gentleman, not very old, as old as Myself – but he was to come to My house and he telephoned to Me. He said, “I want to come to Your house so how should I come?” I said, “This place is Oxted, you can come there but if you don’t get a taxi then it’s very difficult, better come to Hurst Green.”He said, “Where?”I said, “Hurst Green.”So he said, “Hurst Blue?” How he is saying blue to green, I don’t know. (note: ‘Hearse Blue’ is a famous colour)I said, “No, it’s Hurst Green.”He said, “What did you say?”I said, “Hurst Green.”So he couldn’t understand. “What is the second one?”I said, “What is the colour of the leaves?” He said, “Blue.” (Laughter.)I said it to Gregoire, I said, “Now listen to him, what is he saying? Colour of the leaves is blue?”So, Gregoire lifted the phone he said, “Alright, you come to Hurst Blue.” (Laughter)So he said, “Now at least...”I said, “What are you telling?”He said, “Now he won’t come, Mother. That botheration is gone.” Such a confused personality, mixing between blue and green! You are fighting. That’s what it is. The attention drifts. So try to see that if you are confused, there is confusion, clear it out by clearing out your chakras.

Now every chakra, let’s have a little testing of it alright, let’s see? One by one. So who are going to answer the questions? Let’s see. Simple questions. Not ‘Mastermind’ (a British TV competition of 1970s and 80s). Very simple questions.

Now, say your Hamsa Chakra is catching, what should we do? Who will answer the question? Hamsa Chakra is catching, what should we do? Let’s see, one by one.Sahaja Yogi: Hamsa, Hamsa.Shri Mataji: That’s the name of the chakra.Sahaja Yogi: Someone said to me that you say Hamsa.Shri Mataji: No...you see this is the Hamsa Chakra so you have to say that, “Twameva sakshat, Hamsa Chakra Swamini sakshat, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh, namah.”See, opened now. Now say it, all of you, because just now you are catching. Now put your finger like this and now say it. (Everyone says the mantra). Say it again. Say it thrice. [Everyone repeats twice more] See? Better.

Now, what happens in this centre that both the Nadis, Ha and Tha, Ida and Pingala, they come and meet and they cross over. So, for the right Nadi, right side, this one, the left Nadi flows and from the right side, the one which comes from the right side flows into left side. These two centres meet here, I mean two Nadis meet here actually, below the Agnya, it’s below the Agnya at Hamsa, you see, and the problems come to you either from the right or from the left.

Most of you catch on Hamsa here, because of cold or whatever it is. Now, I have told you many things by which you control your cold. But if it is due to the left side, left side catching is there, then for left side Hamsa what should you do? Tell Me.Sahaja Yogi: Keep your eyes on the ground, on the green.Shri Mataji: That’s one of them, but another thing, I mean as far as mantra is concerned what mantra will you say...Sahaja Yogi: Ekadasha Rudra.Shri Mataji: No that’s much higher, that’s even above the Agnya.Sahaja Yogi: Mahakali.Shri Mataji: Mahakali, correct. But you can say Ida, Ida Nadi. Now see just now I have told you that it is the Ida Nadi which comes from the left and goes to the right side. So, you have to say Mahakali or Ida Nadi, Ida Nadi Swamini. Now say it. Just now you are catching on the left.[Sahaja Yogis take mantra of ‘Ida Nadi Swamini’.]Shri Mataji: Again.[Everyone says the mantra.]Shri Mataji: Again.Now, then another thing, that supposing your right side is catching, or you have a liver problem, then what should be used – light, sun’s rays or water?Sahaja Yogi: Water.Shri Mataji: See, right side is heat, is Surya Nadi. So you have problem of Surya Nadi – right side. So to neutralize it you have to use something else. So then that time what you have to say, is to – you can say, you can take the name of Chandra, you’ll cool down. If there is heat on the right hand side, you should take the name of Chandra.If it is the left side catching, then you have to take the name of Surya.

For example you are possessed, then go and sit in the Sun – all the bhoots will run away. They run away from Sun. But supposing you are an egoistical person then go and sit in the moonlight. May be you’ll be little lunatic. (Laughter) It comes from the word ‘luna’, you see? But if you are a crying type and all the time over-romantic [it’s] better not look at the moon and better see the sun. See the compensations. This is absolutely understanding that many people, if they have liver they put in this [fire]. What can the fire do now? There’s already fire here. Adding fire to the fire again, you see? But, also, what one can do is to take out this fire and give it to this one.Now, how do you do that?

Sahaja Yogi: Lemon?Shri Mataji: No, no. to fire. Supposing I want to treat My liver with fire. How do I do it?Sahaja Yogi: You put your finger actually to the flame so that it burns off.Shri Mataji: No.Sahaja Yogi: It'll take too much a week! [Laughter]Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s correct but something takes some times about it.Think it over then, think it over, take it over. You see, you have to take out your heat and give it to these heights. How do you do it? Think it over.I’ll tell you simple thing is: this left hand is minus, this [right hand] is plus, you can take like that, alright? So whatever you do with left hand you suck in. Whatever you do with right hand, say, for example, you give out. Alright? So now if you want to now give out, what you do is to put left hand on you here and right hand outside. So this is cooling it here actually and the heat is going there. But if you do the other way round, you are sucking heat.Sahaja Yogi : HumShri Mataji: But from the left hand side you do it like that. Just electronics, alright, then?Now if you burn here is a good idea, very good idea for Left Nabhi. So the Left Nabhi gets heated up.This side needs heat. This side needs cooling. This is the basics.If something wrong with this side (right) you have to give it the cool. If something wrong this side, you have to give it the heat. Some people get too much cool vibrations. They’ll perspire and cool, means left is finished. Now what should they do as far as fire is concerned? Let’s see.Sahaj Yogini: [inaudible] right hand hereShri Mataji: He perspires. Right hand on the heart, left hand here. If anyone perspires, it means his heart is weak. So put right hand here at the time on the heart. The heat comes in. Are you following the electronics, no, the electrical?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: So the basics if you know that the left side is the cool side, the right side is the hot side. And above the hand, this is the minus side, this is the plus side. Even you can do like this and you are balancing yourself. That’s why in India we do, specially if you see a great bhootish [person] then you’ll do like this, fully. You see?So, these two sides are: one is the hot side, one is a cold side, while the Sattwa Guna is the meeting point, is lukewarm. The Sattwa Guna gives you the temperature that you have. Alright? And these two give you either very cold or very hot.

So we come back to now sinus again. It is which side problem?Sahaja Yogis: Left hand side.Shri Mataji: Correct! Left side, because there are three things now in our bodies. One is...what do you say to that? Bulgam. Another is the bile and the third one is the gas or Vayu. Alright? So the left side is the Kapha. All these colds and things are due to left side. And the right side is the bile. The fat is created from bulgam, which doctors do not know. Do you know that? When fat is heated up by the right hand side, then it dissolves and the gas movement is in the centre. When these five types of gases which are within us, when they all combine together and get enlightened by the Spirit, you get the Cool Breeze coming out.So the centre path is the prana. When it gets absolutely heated up then diseases like tuberculosis, all these things can come in. And when it gets heated up on the left hand side you get tuberculosis and all these things due to too much heat. When it gets heated too much, then it comes to the right hand side and you get diseases like liver and all these heatening things on the right hand side. So though the left hand side is cold, if it is heated up then also diseases are caused.

Now we have to go into details sometimes to find out what, basically, are our diseases within our body. We should know what is our disease. Sometimes even if you have ordinary cold, it is a disease, according to Sahaja Yoga. You should be a normal person. Supposing you are suffering from, say, the terrible disease, the greatest nuisance and the blessing of London and England put together – is cold. Call it hay fever, day fever, or anything! So it is due to what? It is due to basically within us less resistance, no immunity. Less resistance come to us because of lack of calcium within us. Those people who have taken proper care in childhood, taken vitamin A and D and good massage, say with cod liver oil or olive oil and things like that, and proper sunning of the body is done, such people suffer less from cold. Specially the Vishuddhi Chakra problem it is.Now those people who have not been careful about their Vishuddhi Chakra get the disease settled within themselves, but when this disease is settled, what happens actually? What is the reason, as we said that it is the left hand side problem. Cold is a left hand side problem. That means cold has something to do with your emotional side. That means there’s something also wrong emotionally with you. So it indicates that you have some emotional problem. According to Sahaj Yog, to overcome cold one should see into this emotional life of oneself. What are you doing about your emotions? For example as soon as you’re affected by emotions, you will start crying or sneezing. (Laughter)This is a fact. If these are girls, they’ll start crying. If they are men, they’ll start coughing or sneezing. They’ll cough for nothing at all. You see [Shri Mataji coughs] they will go.[Laughter]Isn’t it a fact? Unnecessarily they’ll be doing like this.Is an emotional thing, to attract the attention maybe or whatever it is. To say that how pitiable they are, you see, is a thing by which we show our pitiable condition. You see, is a thing, we reduce ourselves to a position by which we try to, you see, excite the pity in other person.

So this cold is due to our emotional problem. Now so we should see what is our emotional problem. We should find out how much ‘Romeos’ we are [Shri burst into laughs]. And how much delight of life we miss by that. Once you start understanding that you are your own Romeo and you are your own Juliet – most of you will get rid of your colds. Take it from Me.It is some sort of an emotional problem. Could be with your father. A person who is very attached to his father. ‘Attached’ is the word best is, gets also attached to cold. Attached to mother is even worse. If somebody is very attached to her mother, you see, then all reasoning fails and then the mother misbehaves or does something and the child feels very hurt, the child cries, he gets the cold. Any such attachment which makes you foolish should be given up, to get rid of your cold, I mean to say. Whatever makes you stupid, foolish or hankering after someone, creates troubles like colds. ‘Romeos’ specially. Then very beloved children, beloved fathers, beloved mothers, you see, the ones for them their daughter is important, their son is important. Some people just don’t love their children and if some love they’ll dump them onto everybody else.

So these two types of it. You must know that you are just a trustee of your child and as far as your ‘Romeo-ness’ is concerned, you are just to see drama of your Romeo, that’s all. Then this detachment will take place and a simple disease like cold which looks so horrible, incurable, can be cured. As long as you people have cold, without having any romantic feelings Myself, I also get it. So I request you to rise above these things and become more sensible, and your attitude should be of enhancing mutual understanding, mutual love, and not romantic feelings.

But worse than that is dry feelings, on the right hand side you know. Then if you have a dry throat you cannot even speak. Suddenly you find -finished- [laughs] you just can’t speak because you are dried. So the other side is where some people try some psychological tricks with their wives or husbands – like “I will not speak”. This I’m telling you just an emotional side of life. “I’ll not talk to her. I’ll not speak. I’ll behave like this.” Dryness. That also kills the delight. The one is overdoing of it and one is not doing of it. You see, either you’ll take sugar which is one ton in one glass, or you will not take sugar at all. You will not take one spoon of sugar. Not more, not less, you see, to have the optimum delight of tea. In the same way, in life also, you should not take too much of something and too little of another thing. Now somebody who’s married now, for that person, Indian women specially, husband becomes last one, then everything else is zero. Then such women are useless. Or men that I’ve seen here, they are just mad on their women. For them also, life is useless.

So take a balanced attitude of the whole thing in that. It is in you is the person who is loving your wife, who is also within you. You are your wife, you are your husband. Now the wife who is your wife outside, if she just does not tally with the wife that you have within your mind, that should not upset you, because that wife is always with you. Once this understanding develops, you see your partnership -[Shr Mataji aside: by the way I found your letter]- the partnership of husband and wife could be absolutely perfect.Now with the children as I said -Hello, by what train did you come?Sahaja Yogi: The late one. [Laughter]Shri Mataji: Real late one this one was! What about your food?Sahaja Yogi: We both had some.Shri Mataji: Really? Where?Sahaja Yogi: In Winchester.Shri Mataji: You were telling something else. Where? I mean if you are telling the truth you’ll tell the same thing.Sahaja Yogi: We had some chicken from the Fish & chip shop.Shri Mataji: Alright. There is some food if you want, please have. Please let them have..... We were just missing you all. Yes, very good, very cool and nice (vibrations). Good.May God bless you.So you go and have your food.

Now, why making it so light : for you to understand that marriage is not a serious problem. [laughter] As long as you have your ideal with yourself and you don’t try to impose that on your wife, or the wife does not try to impose that on your husband.Let the wife be a wife and husband be a husband. But the wife should not become the husband and the husband should not become wife. If that happens, then I don’t know how to correct it, because that’s something absurd if that happens. Now, on that the main thing one has to know is that you are married to have children, not to be Romeo and Juliet anymore. You better have your children. And then the children that will be born to Sahaja Yogis are going to be realized souls, tremendous source of energy. That’s why you are married, that’s why you are going to have children. Then look after your children with respect, regard. Don’t spoil them! And develop [them] in that love of Sahaja Yoga.

Now this we started with our Hamsa Chakra. Now see the Hamsa Chakra is the left and the right. The left is the woman, the right is the man. They meet at Hamsa. So this is the wedding place of your left and right. If there is no balance between the two, there is a problem. They have to be equal. But they are not similar. Left is left. Right is right. So the right must be on the right hand side, left must be on the left hand side and here when they come, they marry, and this is the point one must know that, whatever is the function of a wife is, she should do that first whatever is the function of the husband is, he should do that first. And then the secondary functions of life can be shared and understood. But it’s not possible that the wife goes to work and husband starts producing children. You cannot do it! [Laughter] And the other way round.

So whatever is the work is so important. To be a mother, I think, is the most important. Today if you didn’t have a mother, which father would have done this work, you tell Me. Which one? Can you think of anyone? There may be ‘Father in Heaven’, but Father on this Earth working with all Sahaja Yogis, let Me see which one is there. Anyone of these fathers, you call them. Nicely to sit down on Heaven and watch the whole stuff. But who’s going to do the work? Washing the dirty linen and washing all the napkins and things is done by Mother. She does this with love and attention and with care, and She is the one who knows how to grow Her children. Is the job of a mother. So Mother’s job Mother can do. Father can sit in the Heaven very nicely. All thanks goes to the Father. While the Mother is doing a thankless job here! Alright, doesn’t matter. It is so, so should be accepted, whatever may be the situation, whatever may be the position.Now at Hamsa Chakra, this understanding must come that you must balance both the nadis, the left and the right. Now to balance the left and the right, the best way is to do some breathing, is to take the air through one nostril and keep it waiting here for a while and then allow it to go out of the other. Then you breathe in with this one, allow it to stay here for a while and then allow it to go down. But it is to be done very slowly. Not in a hurry, not too much. Only thrice (3 times).

Best thing that I’ve told you is neti. If not that, another thing I have seen that those inhalers, you see that you get, are very good. The neti thing that I’ve given you. If you fill the water below the spout and fill it, put in some two, three drops of one of those things that you get for inhaling and put that neti thing in one nose only, and with another nose it goes up. Then you come, bring it here, it goes up and clears it out. It’s a very good thing. If you do it every night before sleeping, in three, four days you’ll be absolutely cleared out.But the main thing is: it comes because of imbalances in our temperaments. Like a man is a man, woman is a woman, alright, so the woman starts dominating a man or a man starts dominating the woman. The balance is broken. Once you understand the woman is very important – without the woman you cannot, could not have been here. Alright? Without a woman you cannot be here. Man is very important that woman has no meaning without a man. You see, Shakti has no meaning without God. For whom is She working? For whom is She doing all this? For God to be pleased. If there’s nobody to see the job, why should She do it?So both have great meaning. And if you understand that both beings within us are balanced, understood, respected in their proper ways and shared and coordinated, the personalities in proper understanding, respect and love, your Hamsa will be alright. You’ll feel better.So you have to correct your ideas about marriage, about women, about men, about yourself. That’s very important because it is a very big emotional thing and, as the left side is weak, all people who have left side weak get cold. And all the things that has to do with your – they call it bulgam, is it? What’s it called?Sahaja Yogis: Plegm.Shri Mataji: Phlegm. Phlegm. Phlegm. It has to do with your phlegm.So emotional side is to be properly nourished and looked after and one has to know that your dignity is the most important. Anything indignified is not love. Love is very dignified. And if you keep your dignity, you’ll be amazed how you will be able to solve certain problems.

Now, again I’ll ask you a question. Now, how many have answered the questions? Most of them you answered very well. Now one more question I will ask. Very simple, not so difficult. That: what is a difference between a baddha and a bhoot? How will you make out? A hindrance and a bhoot.

Sahaja Yogi: Bhoots will move around.Shri Mataji: And baddha?Sahaja Yogi: Stays there. Just describing, it’s a block at that point.Shri Mataji: Though it’s correct, [what] you said is correct, but it is not absolutely precise. It is like this, I tell you. It’s correct. I mean what he says is the correct answer but it’s not so precise. Baddha will also move. I’ll tell you how. Baddha is always on the centres or on your organs, say. If it is, say, in your, for example in the liver, this baddha may come in the centre and then it will start moving from your here to here as the Kundalini will move. Alright? But baddha doesn’t have its arbitrary movement. As you move the Kundalini, the baddha moves. ‘Baddha’ means the hindrance. Alright?But a bhoot is arbitrary. It moves. It will be one moment here, it will be one moment there. It will move this side, it will move that side. It will go to the right heart, then it will come to the left heart. If it is arbitrary behaviour, that means it is not controlled by your movement of your fingers through the Kundalini awakening then you must know it is a bhoot. Alright? Now understand what I’m saying by decisive thing, that, one thing is arbitrary, works on its own, and the another is in your control. You’re taking it out yourself.Like you can say that if there’s some lump in the body, it may start moving with the, say, bloodstream or something, some force acting upon it. But by itself, it does not. But if there’s a worm, living worm, it will move by itself.So the last question is then, how do you manage the baddha and the bhoot? How will you take out the bhoot of other people without getting yourself into it? Otherwise the person whose bhoot has to be taken out will put three bhoots in you and five in the others. (laughing) I have seen many a times they’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, he’s possessed.” Alright. And they themselves are! (laughter) How do you take out? Come along.Sahaja Yogini: BandhanShri Mataji: What? Bandhan? No!Sahaja Yogi:You can throw the bhoot into a candle.Shri Mataji: I mean, I’m saying a real one. He’s not even afraid of candle.Sahaja Yogini 2: Say the mantra to Mukti DeviSahaja Yogini 3: The Lord’s PrayerShri Mataji: There’s no general thing about it. Alright? All answers are correct but they are not complete. There are ways and method according to different bhoots...(asid in Marathi with yogini)... They are trying to solve the problems but [she] said it’s rather difficult!Now, first of all, you see a person who is possessed. I mean you are sure he is possessed, so you do like this, you see. [Laughter]. Take a form, you have to take a form because you have to fight it. You take an aggressive form.Sahaja Yogi: Karate, Tony’s Karate [Tony Cooly].Shri Mataji: Karate, yes. Something like that. So then, I mean inside you become higher than that person. Otherwise if you go like (laughter from yogis). After some time (more laughter). So you go with a great force on that person. You put a bandhan and say, “Now sit down.” Talk to him like this. You don’t go and say, “Please sit down,” because the thing will come and sit in you. Just say, “Now sit down.” Alright. There you have to say as if you are not compromising on this. No compromises. Then you ask the person various questions, after giving yourself a bandhan and do that to verify what sort of a bhoot it could be. That’s the best.

First of all you ask that person, “Have you been to any guru?” So now you know at least sixteen of them. And you know how to take them out, also. So you find out which bhoot he has been to. If it is a guru, you just ask the person does he still believe in that guru. If so, you have nothing to do with that person. You have no business. You say, “I’m sorry, sir” .... Not sorry. You say, “Please go away.” If you say “sorry” it will come inside. Any inviting word you should not use. Just say, “Alright, finished!” you get out from that one. But in case he says, “I am possessed. I know I am in trouble, I’ve got this thing” and all that, then you tell that person that “What is the name of your guru? What is the mantra you got? How many years you have been?”Like that, you ask the question. If he is truthful and if he tells you that, then you exactly know where the mantra is, what has happened to him. If it is a guru, then it has to be in the Void. If it is in the Void you tell him to say the mantra of Adi Guru, or ask the question, “Mother, are You the real...[guru]?” on the photograph. Keep the photograph in front of your face like a mask if possible. Don’t allow you yourself to be exposed but give the photograph to the man. You say, “Now ask the question to this photograph.”Now if the person asks the question, the Kundalini will start coming here doing “gragaral gagal.” He’ll also see the thing there, you see, bubbling up. Then you should say that, after asking the question, “Now you say that, ‘You are the guru’!”

If the person is possessed by a guru, then if you know the name of the guru, then you know the mantra. When he’s doing all these things, you go on saying “Narakasura Mardini” or “Mahishasura Mardini” or anything like that, whatever you have to do. Or “Sarva-asura Mardini” For guru this thing, best thing is salt, vibrated salt. You give some vibrated salt with water to that person to drink. It’s not easy to get rid of the guru, so you tell him very firmly that he’s one of the horrible ones we have ever known, so you have to work very hard to get rid of it. You give him salt, give him all that, let him do it. And do not hurry up. Tell him it is going to take time, it will be alright, and what troubles people had with this, and [that] he’ll have to work hard. This is one type of bhoots you will find. Then you find these are guru bhoots and which takes time, which are very difficult and they can take you up, it can be very dangerous.

But say, somebody becomes blind with a bhoot. His eyes are open and he’s blind. That’s sure shot [that] he is blind because of a bhoot. Two types of blindness are possible. The Left Swadhishthana will be catching and you will see it is due to bhoot. But it can be also Left Swadhishthana catching and becoming blind could be with diabetes. Could be the combination of both. So you ask him if he has diabetes or not. If the person has no diabetes, then definitely it is the bhoot.Now what do you do to take out that kind of a bhoot?Sahaja Yogi: You use a candle enlightened.Shri Mataji: Not only candle, won’t work. You take My hand. Photograph, only hand. You have photographs of My hand, and put a candle before that photograph. All these photographs that you have separately have meanings. Put the candle and behind that is the hand and ask the person to see the light, if he can see the light. Gradually, you’ll be amazed he will start seeing. This is to be used.You see, in Sahaja Yoga, one has also to be precise just like the English words [laws?]. If you are precise, it comes out. If you are not precise then you try this, you try that, it won’t work out. But if you have a photograph of My hands you should ask the person to see the photograph of the hand. By seeing the light, gradually the person will start seeing the hand, and then gradually the person will become alright.I’ve seen one person getting the eyes within ten minutes time. But in that, if the Left Swadhishthana is catching, if the person has no diabetes and eyes are open, then it is definitely a bhoot, nothing else. Even if some people might say, “She lost her eyes because of, this girl lost her eyes because there was a fire in the house.” But she got frightened and the bhoots sat in here and she became blind. They are connected both things. Actually eyes cannot remain open if the eyes are burned out. So if the eyes are open and absolutely normal to look at and the person cannot see, the light is out, that means there’s a bhoot. So these things can be very easily done.

Sahaja Yogini [in Hindi]: How do you do it?Shri Mataji: Photograph like this, and the light in front. It will improve your eyesight also. My hands should be used, very good for the eyes. My hands are extremely good for your eyes. If you can see My hands with the light, very good for your eyes.

Now what are good My feet for?

Sahaja Yogi: Agnya.Shri Mataji: Very good for ego. And also superego. Is very good for people who suffer from ego or superego, My feet. Because, such people are very gross. And the feet solve the problem. So just use My feet.If they see My Face, the ego will start working, “This face is like that, it should be like that – this, that.” Superego might give problems. Even supraconscious will give you problems. But feet, even if you are supraconscious, they’ll correct your problems. Feet are not only powerful but they go up to the grossest point where you are. Any type of person. Say, a drunkard and all the bad things which are, a criminal, some sort of a man, you just use My Feet, he’ll be alright. Face won’t work for him.Face is for the seekers. But for all such people who are absolutely incorrigible type, feet is the best. Those who have extreme ego, those who have extreme superego – extreme. Feet are very important. You also sometimes watch My feet. That’s a very good way, exercise. Just watch My Feet to get rid of your grossness. Just watch with your eyes. How are you going to watch through your Sahastrara? (laughter) But also with Sahastrara you can see.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, do You think if we used Your feet in the photo in the newspaper advertising we’d get more people?Shri Mataji: Will be better idea.Sahaja Yogi: We’ll try that.Shri Mataji: But you see I don’t know. (laughter) Try. Very good idea. You see on My books and all that we have tried. On so many things I have tried, put My feet. Indians understand it.

Sahaja Yogi: Do you think they’d understand in the US?Sahaja Yogi: Well, you don’t have to say Your name in the same thing.Shri Mataji: Let’s put My feet.Sahaja Yogi: Will just let it work through. We’ll put Sahaja Yoga, we won’t say anything about Whose feet they are.Shri Mataji: Try. It is very good. They’re tremendous. See all the lights reacting.You see?[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

[Some yogis start rubbing Shri Mataji’s feet.]Putting on the feet. Come bring it here. I would like to give him there, alright, give him there so he can do it better.[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]Mmm. See the face. Now give chance to others also.May God bless you.Come along.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
