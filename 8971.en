[49:20 Cut in the video. SHRI MATAJI STARTS HER TALK ]

Sahaja Yogi: They’ve all had a nice meditation Shri Mataji. I think most of them are feeling it. They asked a few questions this morning, I tried to answer but I’m sure You (?). Perhaps you would like to ask Mother some questions.

Shri Mataji: Yes, better ask, it’s better. Because I don't know what to say. Because I don't know what you want to know. So better to ask me direct.

Sahaja Yogi: They’re all thoughtless.

Shri Mataji: She has, you have some problems? You, I’m asking.

Sahaja Yogini in audience: The fontanel bone ... Kundalini is burning (?)

Sahaja Yogi: The Kundalini when it rises can be quite fiery and dangerous. It’s written in books and things.

Shri Mataji: Oh yeah, all nonsense. It’s all nonsense, you know I tell you this is the trouble is that supposing again a villager comes in and he puts his fingers in the switch you see, plug and says I get a shock from electricity, no light. What will you say? That you have no knowledge about it. 
,In the same way, those people who felt the fire and all that have been the people who led a very bad live themselves and they use sex to awaken the Kundalini. Now, as you have seen in the chart, you can see clearly there, that the Kundalini is above the Mooladhara chakra. That is a very significant point. It is above the Mooladhara chakra, means when it is awakened, it doesn't pass through the Mooladhara which looks after the sex. So sex does not play a part in the Kundalini awakening. On the contrary, when the Kundalini is awakened, the sex sleeps off. You become like a child, innocent and then it rises. So, these people tried to excite the sex to raise the Kundalini so there is Shri Ganesha sitting there you see, He gets angry and that’s how you get this fire. 

I told you the other day how people have such problems. There was one fellow who felt that lots of bees have bitten him but another one I knew who had a blister all round like, all round in his neck, like a garland. So these are the people who do not know what to be done and they just, what we call it, Anadikar Chertya (?) means unauthorized behaviour. But as a mother, I give them, a sort of chance, benefit of doubt about that, as a mother. I think that they must have tried to, see the chakras. You can do it, supposing you go jump on to your sympathetic, you can jump on to your sympathetic. If you try very hard, you see, you go to the right or to the left, you jump on the sympathetic nervous system. Then what happens if you are on the sympathetic nervous system, say this is nice three flowers that can give you an example now put it this way. So what happens that when you jump on the sympathetic that is this one or this one, all right, this gets, this has a connection with this, like that, see the connection moves the path is like that, you see, can you see my hand going around this flower, this flower. All right? 
So what happens when you move towards this side, you can move around these centres on go back and they can see the centre, but while you have got your realization passing through the centre. You don't see, you didn't see any centre or anything. They see because they're from outside. Say, if you want to see this house, but you have to go out to see the house isn't it? Like that. So they, what happens, that they come round like that and go around like that. So while going around the Mooladhara chakra, they tried on Mooladhara. On Mooladhara chakra, they must have seen, the...

Have you seen Ganesha? Have you seen Ganesha or not? He... (Marathi words...?)   You haven’t got any Ganesha here?

[Some Sahaja Yogini tries to find one.]

So the whole story will know about Ganesha, how Ganesha was created as an eternal child, and now he has a trunk, see, and that trunk they must have seen and felt that this is the Kundalini, you see? So they must have fixed the idea, I'm giving a benefit of doubt of myself, just not to curse them permanently. You cannot use sex for your awakening. So they tried doing this sex business, let us excite the sex and Kundalini will rise. How can it be? This is why when you try to do all these wrong things, you get the heat and that's why they say it’s a fire, it is not. This is all very recent. You’ll be surprised these books are written only, about at the most sixty to seventy years back. But if you see our ancient books, no where, not very ancient also, Gyaneshwarans, (Marathi words?). 18th century we had Gynaneshwara. We had Kabir dasa about 300 years back? 300 years back Kabir Das. They never wrote anything. This is all recent, because this stupidity came from somewhere that you excite sex. The sex business started only recently, isn't it? And since then they started saying, if you excite the sex, you get your realisation. Imagine. Sex plays no part. You can see it clearly there.

Sahaja Yogi in audience: Mother, somebody in the room, I won’t name the person, but since their seeking has gotten stronger, the relationship with the husband has gone down to the point now where it is not good. And secondly, the sexual communication is absolutely finished.

Shri Mataji: How can that be that? That's not possible. That means in a wrong way you’re going and I'll say it again, we’ll use the same. Good idea, three flowers. So these are our three channels, all right? Now, what happens that when you start seeking, how do you seek? Through your mind? There’s no other way out. You have no Kundalini awakening, nothing. I mean, the real path is through Kundalini awakening, your attention goes up. So what you do, you take your attention like this you see, it is here, spread out. Now when the Kundalini rises, She pushes up like that on pierces through. And then, the collective consciousness and all these qualities penetrate and that's how you get your attention completely covered with these qualities. Otherwise, what you do is to either move to the left or to the right, so this attention goes to the left or to the right. You cannot do otherwise. You cannot go up because the path is off Kundalini.

[A Sahaja Yogini gives a photo to Shri Mataji of the Ashtavinayaka, the "eight Ganeshas" swayambhus in Maharashtra]

These are the Ganeshas which have come out of Mother Earth in India, you see? And that, they give vibrations. That’s how you make it out. In the Bible, it is written that whatever is created by the Heavens, that is the incarnations, and whatever is created by the Mother Earth should not be reproduced and worshipped. But we miss the point. We don’t want to see what is produced by Mother Earth. There must be something.

So many things, and the Realised souls, when they make some statues, that, they also emit vibrations. They also emit vibrations.

I don’t know about America but in America also, I may be able to find out places. But in France, this place, Notre Dame, the Mary’s statue gives vibrations. Notre Dame gives vibrations. Stonehedge gives vibrations. So many places give vibrations but unless and until you are a Realised soul, you cannot make it out isn’t it now?

So what I was saying that when you go to the extremes on this side or this side, now if you go to the extremes on the right side, what happens that you become right-sided person.

First, your liver goes out, then you get your heat, then you become a dry person, then you go with it more and more especially if you do Hatha yoga and all that, you go to the right side much more. Then by going to the right side much more, it has physical effects also or it has also emotional effect and the emotional effect is that you become very dry, very dry person. So dry that you become of course very dominating, very angry person, very hot-tempered, no doubt, plus you become a dry person. So, as a result of that, your sex organs do not operate normally. One can become impotent.

Even if somebody has a very dominating wife, a man can become impotent. It has emotional, we can say the feelings are necessary for sex life. It’s not mechanical. It’s not mechanical. Now, what happens that when people are possessed, then they, they’re not aware of it. It becomes mechanical because they get possessed, like rapists and all these people are possessed people. They are possessed. So this right-side movement gives you this problem, but if you’re left-sided, then you start indulging into too much and going into it and then you start, a sort of all of the time pining for it, asking for it and also whatever the other party may do to you, but still you feel you are not adequate. You haven’t received your love from your husband, and you start feeling all the time in what you call a separation mood.

That also happens, and you will become hysterical, start crying for not understanding. So if you are too much in, say, in a way, in a seeking, where you become a devotional personality, then what happens such devotional people, they are all the time, they are crying. Those who are seeking in the other way that reading too much about it and sacrificing this and sacrificing this, and then also saying I’m detached and detached and all that nonsense, you see. You really get detach from your emotions. There’s no balance.

Even a person who’s running on the streets, I find all of them, you see, running all the time, what you call them? Jogging. If you overdo it, they may become the same, very dry, very dry. Those who pay too much attention to their physical fitness become very dry people. A questionion of an imbalance personality.

Because seeking, you cannot do yourself, it is spontaneous happening, the fulfilment I mean. Seeking you can have but they go to extremes, you know, they do all kinds of things. I will not eat my food for ten days, and I will not do this... This is all not necessary. I know you are seekers, I know you are madly seeking. I know that. I know that. It happens when you are mad about seeking to do every sort of thing doesn’t matter, it’s all right to get your realisation. You are all right in the center, makes no difference. It happens but you’ll come around. Suddenly we will find you become so romantic with your husband.

Sahaja Yogi: In this case, the husband has lost the interest and creativeness has separated himself because he’s... (?)

Shri Mataji: Is he jogging? Jogging is also madness off seeking I think. It is a madness. In this country, America, such seekers are born, I tell you, such seekers. That’s why the first country I visited was America, you’ll be surprised. But nobody listened to me because they were on another trip of ego, you see. We must pay to the guru. We must buy the guru. This, that, and they couldn’t digest Me. This is too much for them. So they went to all kinds of trips.

So, I said all right, I’ll come later. As a result, we’ve lost lot of them, no doubt. Lot of them have lost. I know, but what to do, you have your freedom to do what you like. I can’t cross over your freedom. I cannot force you to do something, I cannot mesmerise you like the gurus did. It was like a guru shopping, I tell you, going on, regularly. Even in the society, which I move like, so called elite society, they talk like this. Have you been to this guru? He’s much cheaper, you know. Discount, discount is on and all that sort of things. But you are wise people, sensible people, now try to understand you cannot make market of God. You cannot pay for God. How can you pay? I mean, what will you pay? It’s a living process.

We have gone too far with it. We think we have to pay for everything, you see. So, we just can’t conceive an idea that you can get it without paying. And now you have become from amebae to this stage, how much did you pay for that? From monkey to this stage, did we pay anything? Or did we do anything? Just automatically there’s a force within us which has worked it out and that is going to work it out. Leave it to God, who has created us. It is His job, not our problem. It’s His problem. But the seeking is so great and competition as it is in England or in America is so much that you must compete. So in seeking also there’s competition.

And thirdly the worst part is this, which is the worst of all, you are born in a country, which is affluent as a reward of what good you did in your last life. But this country does not have the knowledge, the roots. So you are misled. If you had accepted a country like India, which is a poor country, things would have been all right. It was your choice. Where this knowledge is there it resides, not in the cities where the Gurus are existing to catch you say as soon as you go to the airport, they’ll catch hold of. I (?) was very angry with me when I told them against this parapsychology, very against me, you see. And now the whole foundation has gone down, and the people have become mad in San Diego.

So it was such a contrast and tried, I tried, but didn’t work out. So this dryness comes by thinking too much. You think too much. What are you thinking about? By thinking you receive nothing, you have to be thoughtless awareness, then only you will grow. You cannot sort out anything by thinking. By thinking, you can only move, move in a linear direction, like your science has moved up to what point? To create atomic bomb. Now atomic bomb has become a sort of big demon for them. Anything you do, go to extremes on one side linear, it’s not on all sides and it’s not integrated. But after realization, you see the integrated being within you. Then you don’t think. Let God think for us. Why should we think? He solves our problems. But if you don’t give him the problems, He will say go ahead, try yours. As simple as that, isn’t?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: I have a friend who has a severely schizophrenia son (?) and you mentioned yesterday, that in India, you can help them. Is there anything the mother could do? Or?

Shri Mataji: Yeah, uh, you see just now we have no place as such but we can help him, no doubt. I could arrange something. We have an Ashram near the Himalayas.

Sahaja Yogini in audience: This is in Canada.

Shri Mataji: He’s in Canada?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: The boy is in Canada.

Shri Mataji: What is his age?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: Thirty.

Shri Mataji: We could drive to Yogi Mahajan. All right?

Sahaja Yogi in audience: Would he respond by coming?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: Yes, I think he would. He is belligerent in certain things, but I don’t think he would be within.

Shri Mataji: Well, what is the symptom?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: Uh, he hears voices. He thinks people are trying to poison him. He keeps in his room, won’t come out. His mother puts his food outside the door and he brings it in.

Shri Mataji: Oh, that can be cured without much trouble. Have you got his photograph?

Sahaja Yogi in audience: Where in Canada is he? Mother’s going to Canada.

Sahaja Yogini in audience: Toronto. Well, he’s north of Toronto.

Shri Mataji: I’m going to Toronto. Now, please give me his photograph. May work with photograph.

Sahaja Yogi in audience: Mother is going to Toronto in July.

Shri Mataji: It is the same as we had done in Middlesborough (?). You see this newspaper people in Middlesborough came and asked me, “Supposing somebody cannot see you, Mother. So, what will you do?” I said, “What can’t she see me?” “Because she’s locked up herself in the room. She doesn’t come out. She’s so frightened.” I said, all right, bring me the photograph. And I said, you don’t go and see her for 8 days, let her alone.

But newspaper people as they are, you see, the next day, they went there to see her, and she had gone with her husband out for a walk on the muse (?). And they published it in the newspaper. That  was something good. They said, “The guru who really kept the promise.” They published about it, in the newspaper, they did. Thank God, at least that much sense they had. She’s perfectly all right. She’s written a nice letter to me. That’s very simple. I think, let me try with the photograph.

Sahaja Yogini in audience: All right.

Shri Mataji: All right. When will you bring the photograph?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: I don’t think I have one.

Shri Mataji:  Then can you send it to Warren? London Address?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: I will send it to Warren. I’ll get his mother to send.

Shri Mataji: That’s better. Toronto. Now, purna Torontola (?)

Sahaja Yogi in audience: Michael’s gone. But Mother’s going to Toronto in July.

Shri Mataji: But you can write to Michael also. Take his address also. Michael Knight’s. All right? It’s very simple. Works out. It’s a possession. It’s a possession.

Sahaja Yogini in audience: Is it? Is retardation anything in the same area? I have a son who’s retarded, who can’t... (?)

Shri Mataji: What is the age?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: He’s 32.

Shri Mataji: 32. Can work out, let’s see. Because only at this age, the brain, I mean the skull is calcified but he would be better than what he is. You tell her how to do it? Left Swadishthana. It’s all the same thing. See all this madness, schizophrenia, even cancer, is due to left Swadishthan. His possession. And you see this country when you came in, when the, when the Spaniards came, they killed so many of them. So many of them. First, when I came to America, I thought I was walking in a cemetery or what, God knows. It’s funny vibrations. And you were born in this part?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: No, I was born in France.

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Sahaja Yogini in audience: I was born in France.

Shri Mataji: No, what I’m saying on the whole. It’s so, I mean, full of these horrible people who want to take revenge with you. And they are there waiting, just to grab you. Wars, wars, wars, so many wars you had. All the time wars. In the south and north war and all those things you see. I think so many presidents were killed also, so much violence in this country has taken place. 

Person like Abraham Lincoln has been killed. God can’t forgive these things, you know, He was such a great soul. Now, just see how it’s reacting. This, how many can (?) danger, for nothing at all. Everywhere they go, people are after them. Isn’t? It’s very sad. But this is what it is. You’ll find out gradually how, you see, because you have money, people became so conscious of money and, to give you an example, I’ll give you, in India, once upon a time they needed, I think, some sort of a rice. So they sent horrid rice to India, horrid Rice, Americans. And people could not eat that rice. It’s so horrid, absolutely. So they threw it out in the fields. As a result of that, a funny type of a grass started growing and they call it as, a, Congress grass and it started eating all the crops and all the things. So when I went to Maharasthra, they started saying Mother how to get rid of this one, it doesn’t, it’s like a demon, it doesn’t die whatever you may try. We’ve tried everything. Then, it rained and rained and rained and that grass was finished but there were some other seeds inside which grew up into Acachia, such big, big thorns and they were fatal to children.

All over these Acachis spread out. Even now, it is such a dangerous thing for children to play around because if you go, touches any child, the child may die. They have seen all that and this is called as a mad Acachis in India. Now, we were going to, we were having a procession when I was going in the village. They take out my procession. We had only one American with us, you see and they were all taking photographs and suddenly he got this Acachia in him. Of all the persons, this American should be chosen. Imagine, and then we had to look after him well because it’s a very dangerous thing. Of all the persons, he’s the one only was attacked, I was so surprised. Alan what? Alan Nicks, isn’t it? He got it. So I mean, if you do something like that, you see, I mean this was done by the government.

They should also, when you are helping somebody, be gracious about it. Not to send something which is so useless, isn’t it? That way Russians are very clever. They, whatever they do, they do with grace. So what happens? You get attached to Russians. You give one rupee, you give one dollar, but give it with grace, you see. And if you try to show off, Oh I’ve given you so much money, you don’t want it, isn’t it? Because it hurts yourself, that’s why. So it has been happening like that, the money consciousness has been very vulgarly expressed so many times and this is not good.

So these people have to come down at that level and to see that for helping someone you’re lucky that you can help someone, isn’t it? Because you’re better off. One must know you’re better off, so you’re helping others and it’s a very great thing God’s blessings on you that you can help others. One should think like that. The whole thing should be off love and affection and do it with love but on the contrary, the way they did it was really, they got very angry with all the people that what do think us to be? Worse than our even our beggars would not be such rice, they said. And you have to show them down, you see. And this made them very angry all these people. Off course, I mean, that problem was solved next year. No problem. But the other problems started again. (?).

So one has to understand that when you try to do good to others or anything, you must know that it is, God has made you so capable, that He’s a part and parcel of you. Whom are you helping? Yourself isn’t it? Say, my finger is sick, so I’m helping my finger. Who is the other? I’m helping myself. So, because of these little, little things also, I think God is angry because the way, we have felt about other nations, you see. After all, this is a country belonging to Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna is the chakra of Vishuddhi. This America is Vishuddhi chakra, is the most important and the perfect. I mean it is a very important chakra, this one, and has to take the responsibility of the whole world, supposed to be taking, for the benevolence, for everything. On the contrary, that’s why it is so blessed because it is Vishuddhi.

But they don’t, they’re not aware of it. We should think once, why are we blessed so much? Shouldn’t we? And that’s what has happened. If you think, why are we blessed, there must be something. God wants us to do something, something much greater. This is, that has kept him (?) away from reality. That God has blessed them with a purpose.

Now, say Maharashtra, where you will be coming. Maharashtra, where our work is going on in India, is the Kundalini. Is the Kundalini of the Universe. And England is the heart of the Universe. Imagine, heart is frozen.

English people have a full heart, (1:18:35)
