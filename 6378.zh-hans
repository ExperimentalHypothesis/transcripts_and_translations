主持人:亲爱的母亲 Shrivastava(锡吕·玛塔吉 丈夫名为 C.P. Shrivastava),

是一位灵性母亲以及霎哈嘉瑜伽的领袖。霎哈嘉——霎哈嘉·瑜伽,我非常期待听到您有关霎哈嘉瑜伽的发言,因为我相信您对全世界很多妇女都有这种心愿,所以今天我期待着您打动人心的发言。

锡吕·玛塔吉: 

全世界的兄弟姐妹们:

我感到十分荣幸,能在此著名的会议上谈论世界性的妇女问题。首先我们的主办国-中华人民共和国的政府和人民。我曾有幸访问中国两次,我十分欣赏这个伟大国家的智慧和文化。

在这世界历史上最辉煌的时刻,我们如此深刻地意识到妇女的问题,这一点超出了我的想象。整体而言,妇女在过去的年代受了不少苦,正如之前演讲的女士告诉你们的,因为我们还未意识到妇女的重要性,以及她们在人类社会中的应有角色。社会本身作为女性的创造物,却试图控制和贬低妇女。在东方,可以说由于受到原教旨主义的影响,妇女承受着极大的压力,她们的道德水平是基于恐惧而非自由。在西方她们为自由而战,却得到虚假的自由。西方的妇女有抛弃一切社会和道德价值观的自由。而在东方,可以说大部分的女性都十分胆小,她们受到压制,无法去表现自己。而在西方,我们发现大部分妇女都沦为性感的象征。她们热衷于暴露自己的身体,渴望出现在时尚广告中,获得非常低俗的名气。大部分妇女都接受这种状况,否则她们就不能在这纷乱的西方世界中生存。大部分东方妇女认为十分丢脸和有辱人格的事,在西方却被视为无上光荣。东西方的情况我都已看得很透彻,我想,除非出现新的文化,才能使东方和西方的妇女都能提升自身的尊严,为所处的社会创造更高的道德标准,以此来表现女性自身。否则,无论东方或是西方的妇女,都不能充分彰显她们的女性特质。这个特质是:假如妇女因其女性身份而得到尊重,了解她们的才干,以及她们如何通过所需的教育增强自身的能力,她们便会得到所有的安全感,并会把这种安全感带给社会。

所有谈论宗教的原教旨主义者,期望女性要绝对地有道德,而男士却可以为所欲为,我想相对于女性,我们更应多点男性教育,因为战争的想法开始也只是源于男人。为发展中国家的贫困妇女筹集金钱,并帮助她们脱离贫困,我要承认这些事做起来并不困难。但不幸的是,据就我所知,我们所筹集的金钱,可能不会到达贫困妇女的手中,而最终可能会落入那些贪污的部长、官员和其他负责人员的口袋里,最终将会被存入瑞士银行。我并不想批评任何联合国组织,因为我知道他们非常诚实地对待联合国的宗旨,但他们必须了解背地里发生的事情。在印度我们有两个很大的邦,北方邦和比哈尔邦,都接受过联合国儿童基金会和世界卫生组织的大力帮助。联合国儿童基金会开设一个叫 Angan 的项目,Angan即庭院的意思,在那里儿童可以接受教育,被培养成才。这个项目对孩子们来说没起到什么作用,但所有的钱都进了负责这个项目的腐败分子的口袋里,应该给孩子的钱,孩子们连百分之二也得不到。世界卫生组织也有同样的事发生,他们向印度赠送药物及仪器,那些(赠送的)药物在市场上出售,并且完全被接收者用来牟取私利。世界卫生组织的医疗仪器也是同样的情况。所以那些贫穷的人从没得到什么好处,他们依然是终日无助。所有这些赃款流进了干净的瑞士银行。世界银行给发展中国家的大部分贷款都被转入腐败官员在瑞士银行的私人账户里。故此所有这些发展中国家都欠下了世界银行的债务,但仍然是不名一文,这些钱都到瑞士银行里去了。因此我想恳请各位与瑞士银行交涉,要求他们归还所有被腐败官员转入瑞士银行的赃款,并把这些款项交回给联合国,这样联合国可以将此款项用于妇女教育,和其他那些同样需要我们保持警觉、实际有效的惠及当事人的项目。要组织好人们,尤其是那些参与其中的,诚实的、有爱心的,而且会好好利用这些款项的妇女们,以帮助要实现社会平等的女性。妇女的主要工作是创造一个能更好地享受和平的美好社会。

不道德的贪污和暴力是两个可怕的怪物,正在吞噬我们的社会,我要责备那些贪污者和不道德者的母亲,因为她们在子女年幼时没有履行好母亲的责任。母亲的爱心训练对于把孩子塑造成美丽公民具有首要的影响且最为有效。作为母亲从没试过用心去关爱引导孩子,作为妻子或是女儿,陷入对男性或对这种毁灭性文化的恐惧中,没有尽到作为家庭不可或缺的成员的责任,去强化男性的道德品格。看到这一点也很重要,在东西方两种文化里 孩子们是如何被对待的。在东方文化中我们看到的是,若孩子们没有受到原教旨主义文化的影响,他们会听从母亲的话。这种(原教旨主义)文化使女性低人一等,只能受制于男性和自己的孩子。在西方也有同样的事情发生,孩子既不尊重他们的母亲 更不听从她们的话。我觉得这是因为,总体来说,西方女性用于护理身体和容貌的时间,比照顾关爱孩子的时间更多。母亲和孩子之间的联系在减弱,甚至割裂。从而正是由于这个原因,很多孩子成为街头顽童,崇尚暴力。幸而在东方有许多家庭,在西方也有一些家庭,极力反抗当今社会的腐败影响,悉心照顾他们的孩子,妥善培养他们成人。

但我仍然要说,东方孩子并没有像西方孩子那么严重地被摧毁。也是因为东方的很多人,没有接受原教旨主义文化或是西方文化,且拥有很好的社会环境培养非常优秀的孩子,尽管他们为数不多。但不管他们长期以来在传统上继承了何种文化,这些文化在他们内在都已根深蒂固,对他们来说道德价值观是最高的,高于金钱和权力。

现在的西方充满问题。虽然他们富有,但他们内在没有平安。真相是,妇女是每种文明和每个国家的潜在力量。很明显,妇女是整个人类的创造者和保护者。这是全能的神赋予并分配给她们的角色。种子自身不能创造些什么,是母亲大地赐予花朵、果实及其他馈赠。同样,是妇女生育孩子,养育婴儿,并最终培养他们成为未来的公民。因此妇女应与大地母亲齐名,是整个人类的居所。不幸的是,男性用体力获得支配女性的地位。他们没意识到在人类的奋斗历程当中,女性与男性是互补而平等的伙伴,但两者并不相同。一个社会假如没有认识到这一基本真理,没有赋予女性应有的社会地位,就是一个不文明的社会。在我的国家有句这样的梵文:"yatra narya pujyante tatra ramante devata",意思是:“哪里有妇女受到尊重和值得尊重,哪里就有幸福女神留驻。”

所以我们此刻要明白造物主赐予我们这种伟大力量的价值。但我们发现了什么呢?无论在东方或是西方,妇女都没有充分地彰显出她们的伟大之处。在此,我并不是说女性在人类社会中唯一的角色是作为母亲,生产及养育儿童,或作为妻子,或作为姐妹。妇女完全有权利作为平等的伙伴参与到生活的各个方面,无论是在社会、文化、教育、政治、经济、行政,以及其他方面。为了让自己为这个全方位角色做好准备,妇女必须享有在各种知识领域接受教育的权利。但如果她们身为母亲,她们便要肩负起对自己的子女的重大责任,如同她们对整个社会的责任那样。男性对国家的政治和经济要负责,而女性要对社会负责。女性可以扶持男性,当然也可以在任何职位上担当领导角色。但十分重要的是,女性不应忘记她们是女性,要展现出母性的深情关爱,若她们变得男性化,而且争强好胜,这样整个社会便不能保持平衡。

同时,我要提出当我们要求女性权利时,也要强调女性在人类社会中的基本责任,西方女性或接受过西方教育的女性,以及我所见过的一些其他女性,她们在扮演政治、经济或行政的角色时走向另一极端。为了与男性竞争,她们变得太过自以为是、自我中心、野心勃勃。她们失去了令人舒缓愉悦,能给人们带来平安和平衡的特质。相反,她们成为独裁专横、寻欢作乐的人,她们更在乎自己外表的吸引力,而非拥有令人愉快 甜美和尊贵的特质。有意无意地,她们会比男性更快地屈服于卑鄙的自我。这一切导致了社会混乱,孩子长大成为街头的顽童,准备着争斗。我们需要在两个极端之间取得平衡。我们需要妇女作为男性的平等伙伴,而并非和男性相同的伙伴。但她们要精微地理解男性的特质,懂得如何运用内在的平衡使男性到达中正平衡的状态。我们需要平衡的妇女,这样全人类才能到达内在平安的平衡状态。你们可能说所有这些想法都不错,但如何达致这平衡的状态呢?我们如何遏止这病态的、腐化的、不道德的、未成年化又暴力的浪潮呢?我们如何结束现在的冲突和混乱状态?我们如何把平安带入每个人的心灵?      请让我谦虚的说:这些问题都有一个答案。这是一个新的方法...

锡吕•玛塔吉问主持人:你想要我告诉他们这个新方法吗?

主持人:他们在等着。告诉他们吧!......(锡吕·玛塔吉说:超时了)主持人:您有3分钟。

无论我正在向你们说什么,都不要看作是理所当然的。你们应该有像科学家那样开放的思想,把我向你们所说的内容看成是一个假设,若这个假设得到证实,那么作为诚实的人,你便应接受这是绝对真理。因为这是为了你的好处,为了你家人的好处,为了你的国家的好处,也是为了整个世界的好处。

我在这里告诉你们人类进化的最后一个突破。我们意识进化的这一突破,必须要在当今这个时代发生,并且已被记录在许多先知的著作里。这个时代被称为“堕落时代”,写下《薄伽梵歌》的伟大圣人蚁蛭仙人(Vyasa)最后一次提到了“堕落时代”。我们现在随处可见人类的堕落。除非我们有所改善,否则战争无法避免。

现在我想说些有关我们内在的神秘知识,这知识在印度数千年前已为人所知。为了我们的进化及灵性上的升进,我们内里有个剩余的力量,位于我们脊柱底部的三角骨内,这个剩余的力量被称为灵量(Kundalini)。尽管有关这个力量的知识在数千年前的印度就已存在,但灵量的唤醒,历来只能是一对一地进行,一个导师只能唤醒一个门徒的灵量。当灵量被唤醒后,发生的结果是:你们获得自觉,到达真我的状态。其次,当这个力量被唤醒后,她上升并穿越我们体内六个精微能量中心,滋养并且整合这些能量中心。最后这个力量会穿越头盖骨上那个我们称为脑囟或梵穴的地方,把你和上天无所不在的浩爱力量连接起来。这个力量在《圣经》中被称为 圣灵的凉风,在古兰经被称为“鲁哈”(Ruh),在印度的经典中被称为生命能量(Paramchaitanya),帕坦迦利称之为改变季节的力量(Ritambhara Pragya)。无论是什么名称,这个力量是无所不在的,这力量造就进化过程中所有关乎生命的精微工作。这个无所不在的力量在人类未得自觉前不能被觉知到。但在得自觉后你便可以在指尖上、手掌心或头顶上感应到。

此外 这个过程是自然发生的,是“霎哈嘉(Sahaja)”。“霎哈(Saha)”的意思是“同在”,“嘉(ja)”的意思是“出生”。意思是获得与上天无所不在的浩爱力量的联合,是每个人与生俱来的权利。我们思维的能量是有限的,我们有限的思维能量呈线性运动,不能支撑实相,到达一处便停止下来,然后像回力镖般飞回。所有这些思维上的线性运动都会飞回来,有时会成为对我们自身的惩罚。因此,所以现在我们需要更多、更高、更深层的能量。为此,如果我们不想有另一场战争,就应当让人们获得自觉。

我要说,在西方我遇见很多真理的真正追求者,他们厌倦了西方那种人工化的生活。有时他们不知道要追求什么,还犯了很多错。他们到那些收取高额金钱的假导师那里去,因此破产,造成身心残缺。有一件事情你们必须注意,灵量的觉醒从而获得自觉是进化过程中一个活生生的过程,我们不能用金钱购买。就像把种子放在母亲大地里,它会发芽,因为母亲大地有力量令种子发芽。这表明我们同样也有发芽的力量,在三角骨(即希腊人称为圣骨的里面),有一个卷曲成三圈半的能量。这表明希腊人知道这是块神圣的骨头,因此称之为圣骨。事实上在一些人身上,你可以看到这个三角骨在跳动,并且灵量在慢慢上升。现在已经有许多人获得了自觉,现在霎哈嘉瑜伽已经进入了85个国家;这些国家都变化很大,彼此间和平共处。在这些自觉者心中,他们就是一个整体,他们变得极富爱心和慈悲心

时间到了 抱歉我不能告知你们更多。我希望你们不要介意,非常感谢!

主持人:非常感谢 我很抱歉您只能匆匆讲完这个方法。这里有她的发言稿复印件可供我们分享,我想这个发言的美妙之处在于她给了一个我们所有人都能运用的获得自觉的方法,从而我们也可以成为爱好和平的人,与他人有和谐的关系。这是我从您的发言中了解到的。但愿我的信息是正确的

锡吕•玛塔吉:非常感谢!

主持人:好,非常感谢!

Note: Shri Mataji had prepared a longer talk to be delivered at the conference. However, due to time constraints, She was not able to read the entire talk. The following is a transcript of the prepared talk.

Brothers and Sisters of the World,

It is a great honor for Me to talk about global problems of women in front of this distinguished assembly. First of all I would like to offer My profound gratitude to the government and people of our host country, the People’s Republic of China. I have had the privilege of visiting China on two previous occasions and I am a great admirer of the wisdom and culture of this great nation that I have visited.

This is, beyond My imagination, the most glorious time in the history of the world that at this time we are so much aware of the problems of women. Women as a whole have definitely suffered over the ages as the previous lady has told you because we have not realized what their importance is and what their proper role is in human society. Society itself, which is her creation, tries to control or put down the womanhood. In the East, we can say, that due to fundamentalist influence women have been under great pressure and their morality is based on fear rather than freedom. In the West they have fought for their freedom, but what they have attained is spurious freedom. The women in the West have freedom to abandon all social and moral values. Thus in the East, we can say, that most of the women are timid, oppressed and cannot express themselves, while in the West we find most of the women are reduced to a sex symbol. They are keen to expose their body. Their anxiety is to appear in fashion advertisements and very cheap popularity. Most of them accepted this position because otherwise they could not have survived in that chaotic world of the West.

What most of the women in the East would regard as very humiliating and degrading is regarded as something very glorifying in the West. I have seen both the worlds very deeply and I feel that unless and until you bring a new culture by which women from the East and West can both rise in their own esteem and express themselves in such a way that they create high moral standards for their society, women neither in the East nor in the West will rise to their full stature of feminine speciality. The speciality is that if women are respected for their womanhood, understanding what they are capable of and how they can empower themselves with all the education needed, all the security will be provided to them and they will provide security to the society.

All the fundamentalists who talk of religion expect women to be absolutely moral and the men can do whatever they like. I feel we have to educate men more than women, because the idea of war comes only from the men. I must admit it is not difficult to collect money for poor women in the developing countries and help them to get out of their poverty, but unfortunately, my knowledge is that the money we are collecting may not reach the poor women but may end up into the pockets of the corrupt ministers, bureaucrats and other people in charge and ultimately will end up in the Swiss Bank.

I do not want to criticize any UN organization because I know they are very honest in their purpose, but they must be made aware of what is happening under the table. We in India have two very big states called as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are very much helped by UNICEF as well as the World Health Organization. UNICEF started a project called Angan, meaning Courtyard, where the children were to be educated and brought up in a proper shape. This project is not at all working for the children but all the money goes into the pockets of all the corrupt people who are in charge of that project and the children do not get even two percent of what is being sent for them. Same with the World Health Organization, which is sending medicines and equipment to India. These medicines are sold in the market and are completely used by the recipients for their own gains. The same happens to W.H.O. equipment. So the poor people never get any benefit and they remain all the time helpless.

One has to have a very good network of people, especially women, who are involved and who are honest, compassionate and who would like to make the best out of this money, helping the women to achieve social equality. The main work of womanhood is to create a good society.

Immorality and corruption are the two horrible monsters which are eating up our society. I would blame the mothers of these immoral and corrupt persons because they failed in their duty as mothers in their childhood. The loving training of the mother is the first and most effective influence in shaping the children into beautiful citizens. Mothers who have never tried to guide with great concern and love, or the wives or the daughters who are falling into the fear of the men or of the destructive culture, have not done their duty as integral members of the family to strengthen the moral fiber of the men. It is important also to see how children are treated in these two cultures of East and West. What we see in the East is that children would listen to their mothers if they are not under fundamentalist culture. This culture relegates women to the level of an inferior human being, fit to be dominated by men and children. In the West also the same thing happens. Children don’t respect their mothers neither do they listen to them. I feel this is because, generally, the Western women spend more time looking after their body and looks than on looking after and loving their children. The nexus between the mother and children weakens and breaks. It is for this reason that many children become street urchins. Fortunately there are still many families in the East and some in the West who deeply defy the corrupting trends of today and look after their children and bring them up properly.

But still I must say that the children in the East are not that much ruined as they are in the West. The reason, also, is that in the East there are many people who have not taken to fundamentalist culture or to the Western culture and have a very good society and produce children who are exceptionally good although this number may not be very great. But whatever culture they have inherited, since long, traditionally, is very much ingrained in them and to them the moral value system is the highest, more than money or power.

The West is now full of problems. Though they have money, they don’t have peace within and without. The truth is that women are the potential power of every civilization and every country. It is evident that women are the creators and the preservers of the entire humankind. This is the role that the almighty God has assigned to them. Seeds cannot create anything by themselves. It is the Mother Earth which provides the flowers and the fruits and other bounties. Similarly, it is the woman who creates the child, who nurtures the baby and eventually brings up the citizen of tomorrow. Women must therefore rank with Mother Earth as the edifice of the entire humanity. Unfortunately, men have utilized muscle power to gain a dominating position over women. They have not recognized that women are complementary and equal but not similar partners in human endeavors. A society that does recognize this fundamental truth and does not given to women their rightful role is not a civilized society.

In my own country there is a saying in Sanskrit, “Yatra nayra pujyante tatra ramante devata”, which means that “Where the women are respected and respectable, there resides the Gods of our well-being”. So it is for us, at this moment, to recognize the value of this great power that is given to us by our Creator. But what do we find? Whether in the East or in the West, women have not been able to give a full manifestation of their greatness. I am not suggesting at all that the only role of women in society is that of the Mother, the pro-creator and preserver of children, or that of a wife, or a sister. Women have a full right to participate as equal partners in every aspect of life – social, cultural, educational, political, economical, administrative and the rest. In order to prepare themselves for this all-pervading role, they must have the right to education in all branches of knowledge. But if they are mothers, they have a great responsibility towards their children as well as their society. Men are responsible for the politics and economics of the country but women are responsible for the society. Women can also support men and they can take a leading part, of course, in any position but, it is very important that they should not forget that they are women who have to manifest deep motherly concern and love. If they become manly and aggressive the balance of society cannot be maintained.

At the same time I must submit that, while we ask for the rights of women, we must also stress the fundamental duties of women to the human society. The women in the West, or those who are educated in the West, have gone to the other extreme when they are taking to political, economical or administrative roles. To compete with men they have become much too self-willed, self-centered and ambitious. They have no more their soothing and pleasing qualities which can keep the balance. On the contrary, they become dominating, pleasure-seeking individuals. They are far more worried about their physical attractions than having a pleasing, sweet and dignified personality. They give into their baser self much faster than men, wittingly or unwittingly. All this leads to chaotic societies and children grow up into street urchins, thieves and even murderers, as we read everyday in the paper.

What we need is a balance between the two extremes. We need women as equal but not similar partners with men, but with a subtle understanding of the nature of men and how to bring them into the center with inner balance. We need balanced women in order to have a balanced human race with peace within itself. You might say all this is excellent in thought, but how do we achieve this state of balance? How do we stem the tide of diseases, corruption, immorality and immaturity? How do we end the present state of conflict and confusion? How do we bring about peace within every mind and heart? I very humbly submit that there is an answer to these questions. There is a new way...

Whatever I am going to tell you now is not be taken for granted. You should, of course, have your minds open like scientists and treat whatever I am stating as a hypothesis. If this hypothesis can be proved, then you have to accept it as honest persons as the absolute truth because it is for your benevolence. It is for the benevolence of your family. It is for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

I am here to tell you about the last breakthrough of our evolution. This breakthrough of our evolution in our awareness has to happen in these modern times and has been, moreover, recorded in the writings of many seers. These are the times called as the “Decadent Times”, last called by the great saint Vyasa who has written the Gita, and it is the decadence of humanity that we see around in every way possible.

Now I would like to tell the secret knowledge of our inner being which was known in India thousands of years back. For our evolution and spiritual ascent there is a residual power within us which is located in the triangular bone at the base of our spine. This residual power is known as Kundalini. Though the knowledge of this power was available thousands of years back in India, the awakening of the Kundalini was done, traditionally, on an individual basis only. One guru would give awakening to one disciple. As a result of that awakening, what happens is that you achieve your Self-Realization, your Self-hood. Secondly, when this power is awakened, it rises and passes through six subtle energy centers in your body, nourishing them and integrating them. Ultimately, this power breaks through the fontanel bone area called as the Taloo or the Brahmarandra and connects you to the all-pervading power of Divine love, which is described in the bible also as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost also in the Koran as Ruh and also in the Indian scriptures as Paramchaitanya. Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara PrAgnya.

Whatever the name, this is a power which is all-pervading, which does all the subtle works of living process, of evolutionary process. The existence of this all-pervading energy is not felt before Realization but after Self-Realization you can feel it on your fingertips or at the center of your palm or above the fontanel bone area.

Moreover, this process has to be spontaneous, Sahaja. Saha means with and ja means born. That means the right to get this union with the all-pervading power of Divine love is the birthright of every human being. Our mental energies are limited. Our limited mental energy, which is linear in movement and has not sustenance of reality, reaches a point and stops. From there it boomerangs and all that mental, linear movement comes back to us as a punishment sometimes. So now we need more energy, higher energy, deeper energy and for that this happening has to take place.

I must say that in the West, I have met many people who are true Seekers of Truth and are fed up of artificiality of the Western life. Also they didn’t know what they were seeking sometimes and they have made lots of mistakes. They have gone to false gurus who have taken lots of money and the people have become bankrupts and mentally and physically handicapped.

The one thing you must note is that the awakening of the Kundalini and thus achieving Self-Realization is a living process of evolution for which we cannot pay anything. It is like putting a seed in the Mother Earth. It sprouts because Mother Earth has the power to sprout it and the seed has an in-built germinating quality within it. In the same way we have this germinating power in the triangular bone which Greeks called as Sacrum. Actually in some people you can see this triangular bone pulsating and the Kundalini very slowly rising, but where there are no obstructions and if the person is a balanced being, the Kundalini rises from the Sacrum just like a jet and passes through the fontanel bone area to become one with the all-pervading power. This Kundalini is the spiritual mother of every individual and She knows or has recorded all the past aspirations of Her child. She is anxious to give second birth to Her child and, during Her ascent, She nourishes six energy centers.

When a person is not connected to the all pervading power, he is like an instrument which is not connected to the mains and has no identity, has no meaning, has no purpose. As soon as it is connected, all that is built in inside this instrument starts working and manifesting itself. When this Kundalini rises it connects you to the all pervading power, which is vital and which is an ocean of knowledge as well as an ocean of bliss. After the awakening of Kundalini, you experience many coincidences which are miraculous and extremely blissful. Above all Kundalini is the ocean of forgiveness. So what ever mistakes you have committed in the past are forgiven and instead you get your self-realization as a blessing.

The consequences of the awakening of the Kundalini and thereby the attainment of Self-Realization are numerous. First and foremost, such a person is constantly in contact with or is in fact a part of the all pervading Divine power. He seeks the truth by using his new awareness. And truth is one. All self-realized persons see this same truth. Thus conflicts are avoided. Purely mental activity without Self-Realization, leads to conflicting ideas and even wars. All this is avoided after Self-Realization.

Now, let us see how many other things happen in a person who gets realization. Firstly you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on your fingertips, which represent the subtle energy centers. Thus you know the truth on your fingertips. You transcend all the limitations of race, religion and other ideas and you go beyond your mind to see and feel the reality and understand it.

he next thing that happens is that you become thoughtlessly aware. We live in the future and the past through our thoughts. They come to us from these two areas of time but we cannot be in the present. While these thoughts are rising and falling we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts. But when Kundalini rises She elongates these thoughts and thereby creates some space in-between, which is the present, which is the reality. So the past is over and the future doesn’t exist. At that time you have no thoughts. You reach a new state as you become thoughtlessly aware about which Jung has written clearly. At this moment whatsoever happens is recorded in your memory well and you enjoy every moment of this in reality. When you become thoughtlessly aware then you become completely peaceful within yourself.

A person who has achieved this peace also emits peace and creates a peaceful atmosphere around himself. This peace is very important. Unless and until we have this peace we will never truly understand whatever our ideas are, whether universal or just limited. You can feel your own seven centers on your fingertips. Also you can feel the centers of others because you develop a new level of awareness which is called as Collective Consciousness. When such new awareness is established into you, you start feeling also the centers of others. I must tell you that these centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing and when they are affected or they are in jeopardy, people suffer from one disease or another. As a result of the awakening of the Kundalini and the nourishment of these centers, an important development would be that you will feel an inner balance and you will enjoy good health. Many diseases, even some incurable ones, have been cured by the awakening of the Kundalini. Even the database of the inherited genes may be restructured after self-realization through the awakening of the Kundalini. As a result, a person who might have inherited genes indicating criminal tendency might become a good man.

Our attention also becomes very pure. In the light of the spirit we can see things much more clearly than when we were blind. For example, a person who goes with his blind eyes and feels an elephant and then another comes in and a third comes in – all of them have different ideas about the elephant, depending on whichever part of the elephant they have touched. But if they open their eyes then they can all see the same thing, the reality, and there will be no quarrel and fights.

A self-realized person can feel the absolute knowledge on the fingertips. Supposing someone doesn’t believe in God. A self-realized person can suggest to the non-believer that he should ask the question: “Is there God?” The questioner will get, you will find, a very nice cool breeze coming into his being. He may not believe in God but there is God.

Unfortunately, so many of those who believe in God are also absurd, hypocritical, cruel, weird and so immoral that people have lost faith in God. But while those who represent God may be wrong, God himself exists and his power also exists which we call as the all-pervading power of Divine love. This is the power of love and compassion and not of aggression and destruction when it is imbibed in a yogi or in a self-realized person, it works in a very different way, like an angel. Such people can cure others and cure themselves. Even mental cases have been cured. Not only that. Even those who have been to wrong gurus in their search of truth have achieved their spiritual stability, after leaving the false gurus and coming to the path of self-realization.

In the next stage, you become thoughtlessly aware, when your Kundalini is stabilized and you know undoubtedly that you have achieved your self-realization, that you have attained all the powers that can be utilized. You become very powerful because you can raise the Kundalini of others. You become very active and you don’t feel tired easily. For example, I am seventy three years of age and I am traveling about every third day, but I am quite all right. This energy flows into you and fills you up with vitality. You become extremely dynamic and at the same time extremely compassionate, kind and mild. You feel that you are protected and thus you are confident but not egotistical. Your whole personality changes. This is the kind of global transformation which is taking place with such a speed all over that I, myself, am surprised at how it is working out so fast.

Actually, this knowledge existed a long time back but my contribution, if there is any, is that we can now achieve en-masse realization. Thousands can achieve mass realization. It is a gift of this time where it was predicted that such a global transformation will take place. In as many as 65 countries, thousands of people have attained their Self-Realization through Sahaja Yoga.

The power of Kundalini is the pure desire of attaining your self-hood. If someone doesn’t want to have it, you cannot force him because the Divine respects the freedom of that person. If he wants to go to heaven, he can go there, or if he wants to go to hell, he can go to hell. Self-realization can be attained easily if the people have a sincere and pure desire to get their self-realization. But if they stick to some of their ideas, which are fixed, the Kundalini won’t rise. Also it cannot work for idiots or for immature people. It works for people who are wise, who are more in the center, and it works very fast. I was amazed to see that it has worked even on people who were drug addicts, who were alcoholics and who were very immoral. But they all had an intense and pure desire to secure self-improvement, self-realization. So many of such people achieved their goal of self-realization. Overnight, they gave up their drugs, their alcoholism . Thus you become very powerful and at the same time you understand that you are now glorified and you start behaving in a very dignified and a very sensible manner. This is how a new culture is born and this new culture takes you, in a way, into a new style of life where you become innately, I say innately, righteous. Nobody has to tell you: “Don’t do this” and “Don’t do that”. It is all achieved through your enlightened attention. This enlightened attention is also full of power. Wherever you put your attention it works, it creates peace, it creates harmony and also it creates a new dimension of collective consciousness.

So to blame your genes for your mistakes is not going to work out anymore because these genes can be changes in their database and can be brough to the level of a very righteous, angelic personality. The ego and the conditioning of a person gets dissolves by the ascent of the Kundalini and he becomes really a free bird. Absolute freedom is achieved in reality and his behaviour changes tremendously with great faith in himself. He becomes a witness of the whole drama of life. When you are in the water you are afraid of getting drowned, but supposing you get into a boat, you can watch the same waters with enjoyment. But if you learn how to jump in the water and save others then it is even a higher situation and so we have a higher awareness which we call as doubtless awareness. Above all, we fall into the ocean of joy. Joy is absolute. It doesn’t have duality. It is not like happiness and unhappiness. It is a singular thing and once you jump into it you learn easily how to enjoy everything, whether it is beautiful or ridiculous. In one case you see the beauty; in the other you see the humour as to how people are ridiculous. The remarkable thing is that Sahaja Yogis have become great musicians, great writers, great speakers, great administrators. In every way they have risen very high, specially in their attitude towards others. They respect everyone and they know what is wrong with other people so that this person who has these problems can be easily evolved and become a self-realised soul. It is like one candle lighting another candle. This work is going on all over the world and there is great hope that it will also start in China. Before this, somehow, I could not start my work but the Divine coincidence has given a chance to me by this conference to talk to Chinese people, whom I find very wise and sensitive, about the great treasure of spirituality. This is not a coincidence. It was inevitable and has been brought about by this all-pervading power. In your life also you will notice lots of coincidences but you will not know how to connect them to something that is Divine unless and until you get connected to like Divine power.

Confucius has taught the humanity how we can improve our relations with other human beings. But Lao Tse in Chine has very beautifully described TAO, meaning the Kundalini. And I have had a voyage through the Yangtze River through which Lao Tse had gone many times. I know he was trying to show that river, which is the Kundalini, is flowing towards the sea and one should not be tempted by the nature that is around. The nature around the Yangtze River is very, very beautiful, no doubt, but one has to go through the river. Also there are lots of currents which flow and can be quite dangerous and we need a good navigator who should take his ship across to the point where it is nearer the sea. At that stage it becomes very silent and extremely simple in its flow.

This country has been endowed with great philosophers, I would say the greatest was Lao Tse, because humanism was for the preparation of human beings for their ascent about which Lao Tse had spoken. But because of the subtle subject it was not described in such a clear-cut manner as I am talking to you. It is such a pleasure for me to talk to this august gathering here. After traveling all over the world, I realize that China is one of the best countries as far as spirituality is concerned.

May the Divine bless you all.
