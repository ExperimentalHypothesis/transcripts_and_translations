They are too maybe small.Sahaja Yogini: 2 years old.Shri Mataji: That will be quite small 2 year old child, and we have to make some arrangement for these children there, you see. Now maybe if have some sort of ashram or something in Bombay where we can leave the children with some good care with some people and then you all can go ahead and then come back to Bombay in 4-5 days, it would be better. Otherwise, you all will be distracted and troubled.Though I would love to have them, all of them. You can leave them with Me and I can look after them.

Who want, who want you come here, Take it, what about you, you would like to have some biscuits?Now let’s have this one. Yes, now you have one.You don’t like it? No?

Doesn’t matter.

Yes. What do you want?

If there are very few who are coming with the children, you can arrange. But many, if they are coming, maybe difficult [unsure]. We are trying to get a- we are trying to buy a flat in Bombay [inaudible].India is full of dust and all kinds of things. But the vibrations are the only thing there that makes people survive in that country.Those who have achieved some heights in Sahaja Yoga India time is very easy and very enjoyable because they enjoy their Kundalini all the time. Allan was telling Me that there if you go to any program, and you don’t understand the language, because I speak in Marathi or anything. Your Kundalini is up there, you see. So, you just enjoy that kundalini. While in England, though I speak in English language, you cannot enjoy the program so muchThere is one Indian girl, Prena, who came, the wife of Allan, she said, "I never see such a program Mother, any program we have anywhere in India all our kundalini is up there. Here you feel so drowsy and funny". You see, she couldn’t believe it was Sahaja Yoga.

It’s a very free country in a way, that you can shout. You can shout, you can do what you like in the villages and all that it’s very free. You can jump into any river, have a swim. They had their swim in, I don’t know, 5-6 rivers. Very clean waters, no problem.
