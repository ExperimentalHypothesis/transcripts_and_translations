At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot organize it, we cannot change it, we cannot order it, we live to accept it as it is. The Truth is that this whole universe is guided, organized by a very subtle power that [UNCLEAR] had to plan it that Param Chaitanya or as they call it as Ruh in Koran or as [UNCLEAR - COOL BREEZE?] in the Bible. In those days of Science, for a modern man is too much to accept that there could be something like a subtle energy which organizes Logically we can accept up to a point to understand so many things which have no answer in Science but beyond thought, beyond the intellect if we can reach into another great truth about ourselves - that is, if you become the Spirit, if you get your Atmasakshatkar, then, you can feel that subtle energy on your finger-tips, on your hands. Also, as a result of this power, the residual power of the Kundalini, which is like this cord, which rises, pierces through six centers, passes through your fontanel bone area you can also feel the cool breeze coming out of your own head. This is the ultimate goal of our human life. You know the Absolute Truth not relative. What we know, is the relative truth. Unless and until this happening takes place within us, whatever we know is so relative that one person may not agree with another person. In one family there may be disagreement but once you reach to this state of Self-realization, there is no difference at all in understanding it that [UNCLEAR] It is a very ancient science of our country.

In the West, I would say, the civilization grew like a tree but the roots are here in the Orient and these roots are like a knowledge of nourishment for [UNCLEAR] If you allow the [UNCLEAR] to grow without finding out it's roots and the nourishment for it, it's definite, that such a tree will have to get completely destroyed. To understand that what I'm saying is the truth, you have to have little scientific attitude towards it. A scientist has to have an open mind to see for himself, that whatever I'm saying, if it is true, then one has to accept it. First this is like a hypothesis and if this hypothesis can be proved then, as honest people you have to accept because this is for the benevolence of every individual, of every society, of every country and the whole of the human emancipation because when this happening takes place, the transformation of the personality - complete transformation. It's very amazing because so fantastic that people cannot believe it that one can be transformed but what is it? Like a, if you take a [UNCLEAR] clean [UNCLEAR] that it's just a box but if you put that connected to the mains, then you find, it's fantastic. In the same way, a human-being is a tremendous powerful personality within himself and the power is that of love and compassion. You have never used the power of love - you have only used the power of hatred, so far. Once the person gets transformed, he becomes dynamic, very dynamic, relaxed, becomes like a witness of the whole play and all that is described about saints, you can see all that working out within you. And this man analyzes and by not understanding it through mental capacity, inhibit [UNCLEAR] up the idea of God Almighty and His powers - that's not true.

Just for a short time at least the [UNCLEAR - GLANCE?] have come but whatever is done, has to accept it and unless and until you find internal [UNCLEAR] we are not going to be satisfied, we are not going to be happy. I don't know what Mr. Murthy has told you about but the first thing that happens when this kundalini rises, is that you get [UNCLEAR] your sicknesses are cured because all the sickness, mental or physical, comes from the disturbances in the chakra in the centers, in the subtle centers which are partly in our spinal cord and partly in our brain. If these centers can be put right and could be nourished by the awakening of the Kundalini, then, you feel the well-being of your health, also your mental capacity. I can tell you many things that can happen. We have known many children who were supposed to be very dull in their classes, they stood first class first, they got schloarships, they're doing very well. On the mental side there have been many people who suffered from mental extremes and diseases of [UNCLEAR] also manifest in the being schizophrenia - they have been cured. There's a doctor in Delhi, who has got now his MD, where he has shown that epilepsy can be cured through sahaja yog. There are three doctors who have got MD and surprisingly when we went to Russia, they saw all our papers and amazingly, immediately they accepted sahaja yoga as an independent organization. This is the only organization which is independent in Russia and they say, they had no conditioning of any kind.

In our country we have conditionings of man made religions. Most of these religions have nothing to do with the people who created [UNCLEAR], they have nothing to do with the Incarnations, nothing to do with the prophets and nothing to do with the saints. On the contrary all the saints, Incarnations have [UNCLEAR] tortured by the same people who say that they are in charge of the religion. I have seen in the West, that the religions are naturally we came to atheism, we start telling the [UNCLEAR] there's no God. The religion is within ourselves. The religion is our valency. Like in the matter there are [UNCLEAR] up to eight valencies. In the human-beings there are ten valencies and once these ten valencies get disturbed, you fall into trouble and you start deteriorating in your health and also in moral values. So, to re-establish yourself, you have to have this last job of breakthrough in your evolution from human awareness to this of, what we call as, the collective consciousness which is just felt on your finger-tips. In the evolution [UNCLEAR] all about.

In any case, I'll be very happy if you can ask Me some questions today, so I could know what are the problems that are affecting your mind, for sometime and then we'll have the Self-realization after that. First thing, you should not be diffident; Everybody is capable of having Self-realization. Everyone can get Self-realization, so nobody should feel anyway diffident about it. If you want, you can ask Me some questions now. I want to give some time for that. If you people can come forward, it would be better because it is such a big hall. You just please - if you can come forward, would be better. [ASIDE - Chashma de do, chashma] Shri Mataji, I would like to know how to awaken the Kundalini? That's very simple. That I will do, that I will manage - it's spontaneous.

It's like sprouting of the seed which is a living process - it's a living process. Through a living process we have become human-beings from amoeba stage and to go higher is also a living process. It just acts spontaneously. First, I'll awaken your Kundalini - just not much to be done and then you can awaken the Kundalini of others. It's very simple. Very good question. Mataji, the Veda is the result of the deep meditation of our ancient sages in the Ritambhara PrAgnya and Your sahaja yog samadhi also deals with this and what is Your experience parallel to Veda of these vibes? You see, Vedas were, I would say, there were three movements in our country in those days. One was on the side of Vedas where - the first, first time that they said it that, "If by reading and doing all these Vedas, if you do not get your Self-realization, it is of no use." Then the same wave find, in those days there were three systems - one was, people were trying to exploit or to find out the way to use the matter and that's how the Vedas started to awaken the Vedas through spiritual powers and that is what is the Vedas it is.

And the another side is, and that's the outcome of is is [UNCLEAR]. The another side is the one where we have bhakti. People used to do bhakti and devotion. They used to go emotionally about finding God. This, the central path was for, actually, redemption and for awakening the Kundalini which was done by mostly the Nathpanthis like Machindernath, Gorakhnath, Adinath - these people did it. Moreover, also you must have heard that Janaka, the father of Sita, gave realization to one Nachiketa - only one person. So, at that time there were very few flowers on the tree of life and that's why very few people got realization. First of all, their basic cleansing [UNCLEAR] through the Vedas - cleansing it and awakening it. The another side was, they tried to build their emotional side to receive the blessings but the awakening of the Kundalini was done in very few people and very few people, few people got realization in those days. Now the time has come that, I feel, there's a blossom time and many people can get Self-realization.

So, the difference between the sahaja yoga that was followed long time back and today is this, that in those days they had to cleanse like [UNCLEAR] from the body and out of that they used to get one person and they would say that to be born again and again, come back again and again - cleansing was done periodically in different lives and that's how then they got realization one person here and there. But in sahaja yoga there are two things which we have been able to manage. First thing, you can give en-masse realization. [UNCLEAR] Kundalini can be awakened and it can pierce through your fontanel bone area but in that little light you start seeing yourself. As I said that, if there's a snake in your hand, you're standing in the dark and somebody tells you, "There's a snake in your hand," you may say that, "It's not, it's a rope," but if there's a little light, you can see that, you will just drop it. So, the cleansing is done by you only nobody else can do the cleansing - first. The second thing is that you yourself get all the powers of awakening the Kundalini, you get all the knowledge about Kundalini, so you can spread it fast. We can say that as it is a jet age we also have to have a jet Kundalini and it has to work that way. So it has grown up to that. My contribution to this is only, is this that I wanted to find out a en-masse way of giving realization to people because one person is Atmasakshatkari, one person can say, "It's gossip."

Moreover, any discovery, say the discovery of electricity, if it was meant for one or two persons, it was never accepted nor of any value. So the time has come for this en-masse evolution and this is working out through this modern sahaja yog. There's no way we are discarding Vedas or the bhakti part of it but the essence of it, the core of it was to receive Atmasakshatkara, which is achieved through sahaja yoga. So we can say, this is the culmination of all these things in modern times. Shri Mataji, how one could realize that Kundalini has been awakened? That is what I was doing. That point you leave. I'm very happy to hear that; That's a real sadhaka - I see the question. May God bless you! [UNCLEAR QUESTION FROM AUDIENCE] [UNCLEAR] It wasn't very clear.

Now some school of thought believe that the Kundalini can be raised from the Sushumna through the spinal cord at the back of the body. Now what we see in this picture, we raise from the Mooladhara up to the Sahasrara, in the front portion so what is the difference of our Kundalini enunciation and here that... [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE] No, no it is on the back. It is in the chart how to show the back so [UNCLEAR] it is not - it is on the front. Of course, the Sushumna Nadi is the Brahmanadi. The Sushumna has also got inside, a very sukshma nadi, called Brahmanadi. Through that only few, few threads of Kundalini rises first and then it starts opening the chakra and then more threads come up So, it is not in the front - it is correct. - Veda gives us three aspects as You said - that is karma, bhakti and gyana. Gyana is the [UNCLEAR] - Alright and it has been accepted. So, but to acquire gyana no karma or no action is necessary? - No - Here this is also a mental action or how do You [UNCLEAR] this?

No, no, no there is nothing to be done. Who told you? Please sit down. Don't be aggressive - just try to understand. Gyana is something that you feel on your Central Nervous System [UNCLEAR] is Bodha - alright? Now, you don't have to do anything [UNCLEAR - IS THAT CLEAR?] It is spontaneous, it's a living process. You don't have to do anything. If you have to do anything, then it is not. Don't have to do anything.

Only thing, once you get your realization, you have to know where are your centers, what is your problem, how to correct them. That is to settle because first you give a connection - suppose - and if it is loose, then you should know how to make it proper because, as it is you know, human-beings have problems and the Kundalini knows, because She is your individual mother. Every person has his own Kundalini and every Kundalini has recorded what that person carries and that Kundalini knows each and every thing about you, so when She rises - She rises although but then again She settles back into the places where you have problems, so you must know how to fix it up - that's all. Who, what made you think that you have to do something? Don't have to do. You can't even pay for it, you can't do anything. It may work it may not work. There's no guarantee. It may work, it may not work. In some people it does not work.

In some people it works immediately. So it has to do also [UNCLEAR] also [UNCLEAR] on inner being. Suppose, you have some sickness you have some mental problems, you have some terrible conditions, then it may not rise but we have to give it a chance. Like, if there's a bad seed, it may not sprout. Then, there may be a seed which is not properly planted something like that may happen but most of the people do get realization. Any bad [UNCLEAR] is a good being [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] That is not just now the problem is. You see, whatever you have written or whatever you have done, is alright. Whatever you have done in the past, you have to forget. You have to be in the present. First thing you must know is to forgive yourself and not to think what wrong you have done, what wrong things they have done or the other, sinner and all that nonsense you don't have to think about.

You must know that everybody can get realization - there's no problem. Only thing, you just, if you start thinking about your past and blaming yourself or feeling guilty, then it's difficult. Then you catch this center here - very difficult to raise the Kundalini. So, to raise your Kundalini, you have to know one thing that you are a human-being and it is your right, it's your birthright to get this Atma Sakshatkar. There's nothing to worry about just now, about food. You see, after realization you will know what sort of a person you are and then accordingly you have to adjust your food. Supposing, if you are a right-sided person, then you have to take more of carbohydrates. If you are a left-sided person, then you have to take more of proteins; It depends on what sort of a personality you are because [UNCLEAR] So, first you have to know what sort of a personality you are and accordingly you should deal with it. Mother, once the Kundalini has been risen, will it come down again? - [UNCLEAR - PLEASE BE SEATED?]

Suppose you're practicing meditation everyday then it comes to a certain state. Now, I [UNCLEAR - STOP?] meditation for next one week or one month, will it come down or will it stay where it is? It depends on you. Please be seated, I'll explain. I said, sit. The Kundalini certainly rises, no doubt, it has risen but sometimes, you see, in the beginning, as like a little sapling, it may die out if you do not look after it. In the same way, in the beginning you have to be little careful, must know everything about it, respect it and if it is established, it doesn't. Now, as you have seen Mr. Murthy, he came to Bombay for his sickness is a [UNCLEAR] his wife also and that's how he came because when he got his Self-realization, he came to Madras, he started giving realization to people. They had never seen.

All their Kundalinis are alright, working out but some people even after coming to sahaja yoga do not pay so much attention to it and sometimes may, sometimes may lose the chance. So, you have to be little careful that within seven days you can fix up yourself but some people never lose it - it's just there. Supposing, somebody has a liver problem, then the Kundalini will go to the liver to [UNCLEAR] it first and then to rise it later by in Her own working you must know how to raise it. That's a very simple technique which you can work it out for which you don't have to pay anything, it's not [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] - [UNCLEAR] - Can you come forward please? It's a very big hall na, so we can't hear you properly and echo is there. Kya keh rahin? If through Kundalini awakening people can be cured, how is it that Incarnation - have will be known to suffer from disease? - No Incarnation has suffered - Even Ramkrishna and Ramana Maharishi - Ramkrishna and Raman Maharishi were not incarnations. and they didn't have Mother to tell them - that's the problem - otherwise they could have cured definitely.

You see, somebody has to tell us also, so they suffered especially Ramana Maharishi but nobody was there to tell them. As soon as you catch on anything, immediately you know, as a sahaja yogi. That's why it is necessary to be a sahaja yogi, so you have the full knowledge of the Kundalini - alright? [UNCLEAR] [HINDI - Usspe to aur bhi nahin sunai de raha] Just stand little away from it because of echoes. [UNCLEAR] Atma-sakshatkar thereby completely absorbing ourselves when you meditate for sometime and by forgetting everything and keeping everything inside, so how do you come to know that Atma-sakshatkar is taking place. - (HINDI - Mujhe to samajh nahin aaya) I couldn't understand it. - [INAUDIBLE] Alright, when, how will you know? That's a good idea. Please be seated I'll tell you, please. When you get your Atma-sakshatkara first thing happens, that you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

Then you feel completely Nirvichar - first is nirvichar samadhi is established, then you feel the cool breeze in your hand - all over you can feel the cool breeze; This is the beginning. Sometimes you do feel little heat because it's liver problem, other diseases, then you might feel little heat but after sometime you start feeling the cool breeze. Then you must use. By using this you'll be satisfied that you have got these powers. One may go to samadhi and have bliss there but that is not the [UNCLEAR]. You see, Veda declared 'Satyam Gyanam Anantam'; these are the doctrines of Veda. - That's why, that's why - Satya is [UNCLEAR], Gyana is knowledge, Ananta means endless. This is Your state. When this is the state in the state of samadhi, one have, have a little amount of bliss while in samadhi. - When he comes back, when he comes back, you'll have to undergo the prarabhda so he has to [UNCLEAR] - Alright, I'll tell you.

It means you have read too much but not felt anything - that's why but now either your prarabhda and your karmas all these things can be sucked in by Kundalini - She's so powerful. How She sucks in that there's the Agnya chakra - you see there. This Agnya chakra - tomorrow I was going to tell you all these things but today you want to know, I'll tell you, that on the left hand side is the Ida Nadi, the right hand side is the Pingala Nadi. Ida nadi is the power of our desire and take us to our subconscious and collective subconscious. The right side is the Pingala Nadi which caters to our supra-conscious and collective supra-conscious - the future. Now, left side is the one which is the Ichcha shakti, is the power of desire and the another one, that's the Pingala Nadi, is the one is the reaction. So, when you're doing something and you feel you are doing it, doing [UNCLEAR] then that ego accumulates and forms an institution, as you see there, on your head. Here all the conditionings - the kusanskaras - also form another institution which is called as superego but you can say mana, so we have two things. On one side is the superego, another is the ego. They cross each other at Agnya.

When the Kundalini rises, then She sucks these two things by which your prarabhda, your karmas, are sucked in. It actually happens because when these two are joined, this fontanel bone area becomes a calcified but then the Kundalini rises, they open out like this. The limbic area is in between this [UNCLEAR]. It opens out like that and when it pierces through that, you get your Self-realization. But it cannot pierce through unless and until sucked in. It sucks in quite a lot in the first beginning but later on it goes on sucking more and more so you become ego-less and all your prarabhdas and karmas are sucked in; That's the work of Kundalini - She does it. It's not question of how much you have read. It's the question of experiencing - you must experience. You know, even Shankaracharya, he was such a great soul and how, there was Mr. Sharma got after him by discussion discussion so that he has written such a nice treatise of Vivek Chudamani, which he gave it up and he just wrote Saundarya Lahiri because he knew that this discussion will lead nowhere - there is no tarq about it. You have to experience.

By tarquas you are not going to reach there . You will only reach there through experience. So, humbly one should ask for that experience. By tarq you cannot.... logic can go up to a point because it is very linear. It moves only one direction and it again comes round. It's rationality not logic even, it's rationality because logic could be supported by these people but it's just rationality. So, one has to understand that whatever you have read has to be proved otherwise what's the use of reading everything. Like Nanaka has said, "Kahe Nanak bin aapa khoje mite na bhram ki khai." Nanak says that, "Unless and until you find out yourself, the illusion will not go," so they go on reading Now it's said, "You have got a headache, alright, you take Anacin." Then you go on reading, "Take Anacin, take Anacin."

By that your headache is not going to go; You have to do it, you have to take it. The experience has to be taken. Unless and until you have the experience, it's just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and that has been quite a lot. So, by only understanding mentally, you do not work it out. Everything that you have learnt now through your books can only be actualized if you have your Self-realization otherwise it cannot be. You must know all the saints they never went to any University, they never read any Vedas, nothing. Like Gyaneshwara, at the age of 23 years, wrote not only Gyaneshwari but the great book called Amrut Anubhav. I mean, two stanzas of that you cannot write, it's so deep; Only an Atmasakshatkari can understand the beauty of it. and that is the level is so different from the normal level of intelligence, reading or anything or even [UNCLEAR]. Like Namadeva, who was just a tailor; He never went to any university or anything and he went to meet another saint called Ghora Kumhar, who was just a kumhar means a potter and he was busy making some clay.

With his feet he was just trying to make some clay ready for his work. When Namadeva went and saw him he said, "Nirguna cha bheti alok sa gunati," means, "I came to see the Nirguna, the Nirakara and here I see in Saguna." Only a Atmasakshatkari can appreciate another Atmasakshatkari. We cannot, we cannot understand because are not yet that [UNCLEAR]. Only a person who has felt this, experiences Paramchaitanya, can make out this otherwise you cannot - we are all blind and that's why Kabira has said, "Kaise samjhauun sab jag andha." "How can I explain, the whole world is blind," - is a fact. That's why they killed so many people, tortured so many people, crucified so many; They couldn't see because ignorance and we have to get out of the ignorance to the light, to the Truth and not just to the words - it is beyond that. [INAUDIBLE] - Kindly teach us the yoga today. - Yeah, yeah She's going to tell you. - Annh?

Realization, whether You'll teach - Very nice, please sit. This is a real sadhaka, who doesn't discuss, who doesn't argue, nothing; He wants his realization. That is the sign of a sadhaka otherwise you go on shifting from one to another all your thoughts. It [UNCLEAR] thoughts, you have to go beyond thought to experience and it's for your benevolence, for the benevolence of the whole world and one must experience it. So many people have written so many things, so many people have gone [UNCLEAR]. There have been five hundred Gitas - what we understand Gita is very different. From the way other people understand, is absolutely absurd; Somethings are so absurd that surprisingly how people do not see what Krishna must have meant. It's very surprising. So for that, your inner eyes have to be opened, your inner understanding has to be open, your brain has to receive it's excellence, in understanding. The excellence is only possible if your Kundalini rises, otherwise not possible.

You have spoken of the experience. The experience that we undergo in three states is very different that is the common experience of everyone, all the audience here, so [UNCLEAR] a deep state. In deep state what happens we do not know. Only in the morning when we will get up we will recognize what is the thing that has happened - we will be under the bliss. So, in the two states, the former two states, we will be in the state of [UNCLEAR - PLURALITY?] all this so, that is the Saguna function. Nirguna function is only in the deep sleep state. Even then in that Avidya function we never come, so. But this is all Avidya. What you're talking is real Avidya, I'm talking about Vidya - alright?

Sit down. So, I'll give you the Vidya, that's the point. You must ask for Vidya and not Avidya. "Surdas ki sabhi avidya dur karo Nandlal," Surdas said this after writing the whole of Sursagar. This is the situation [UNCLEAR] But if I'm saying so, why not accept, why not accept. Supposing I say, "There's a diamond here absolutely free available to you." Will you stop coming to that? Even from Australia you will fly out but if I'm saying, it is available to you, why not have it? I mean, I can't understand. I know it is fantastic.

It looks something you cannot imagine but is all predicted, is all predicted - it has to happen. This is in Kaliyuga only you [UNCLEAR]. This is the time when people are in bhranti, in illusion. This is the time it is going to happen; Is all predicted. If you have read Nal Damyanti aakhyaan, once Kala was caught by Nala by the curse of the Kali and he was so angry with Kali because he had to give up his wife and all that, so he caught hold of, one day, Kali and asked him that, "It's better that I kill you so that you do not put people into illusions and trouble them." So, Kali said, "Alright, if you want to kill, you can kill me but you listen to my mahatma, my importance - what is my importance." Said, "What is your importance?" He said, "Those people today who are trying to find, in giri, kandaras, in the valleys and in the mountains, one day will be born as house-holders and at the time when Kaliyuga will come, they will find the reality." But this is just, you can say, the mythology but also in Nadi Granth, if you have read, by Bhrigumuni, he has clearly written - even the deities are so clearly - there's one gentleman from your Bangalore itself, his name was Bhujander, who has transcripted it and brought it to such an [UNCLEAR - UP TO DATE?] thing.

If you also see William Blake*, he has also said the same thing and he has absolutely predicted the whole thing. There's one [UNCLEAR] who has talked about it. Even the Rabindranath Tagore has talked about it. So, I mean, if you see to the prophecies also it is to be done now and it is done. There are 40 nations who are following sahaja yoga. Only unfortunate part is that in Bangalore I have come very late - that's what but there are other places like Hyderabad and all that; We have lots of people who are following sahaja yog. In Bombay there are 18 centers. There are 14000 people who are following sahaja yoga, in Delhi there are 12000 people following, in Noida there are 14000 people following so it's not something, something that is not happening and they don't have to pay anything, they don't have to spend any money - little time has to be given - that's all. About five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening and you establish yourself. It has to be, it has to be sahaja otherwise in these modern times when we have not time for anything how is it going to work out And it has to work out in modern times, so how do you work it out?

You must see if it works out or not. If it does not, you must come to the center it will work out. So please, understand that it is for your benevolence. I don't need sahaja yoga, you need sahaja yoga. I've come all the way from England to give you sahaja yoga. So now, if you could understand what is sahaja yoga is, it's for your benevolence, it's for your good - so why don't do it? As a Mother I would say, "I've done the cooking for you." If you're hungry, you say, "Alright, Mother, let me have it." But if you're not hungry, you'll ask Me, "From where did You get this, from where did You buy that, what did You get this, what did You..," but if you're hungry, "Alright, let me have it." So the, all the audience is not of the same kind because they asked Me, "How do you get it?"

that's the point. - Mother, as I understood [UNCLEAR] - Come little forward Mother, as I understood, the Kundalini shakti, the Grace by our meditation. Now while we are doing this meditationing to raise the Kundalini Shakti, what is the purpose of this Kundalini they are raising it to clean our karma. When the Kundalini shakti rises from the Mooladhara, when it comes to the various chakras, it cleanses the karmas in those chakras How does it clean? - like a car wiper going up and down, it cleans. It comes forward that is said to reach the Sahasrara or whatever maybe. Now Mother, I ask you, whether by stopping meditating for some days will it come down to Mooladhara? - [Shri Mataji Laughs] Don't be so much. Listen, don't be so much worried. - No, my point is - You see, what I am trying to say Just now let Me raise your Kundalini - alright.

It won't come down normally but if you are a sick person, - it has to attend and get there - you're sick there - you're not sick. - Mother, my point was the Kundalini rises and cleans a certain portion. Now [UNCLEAR] up to the Mooladhara It has cleaned all the other chakras. I fall sick for one month - then... No... - Will it come down. It has already cleaned - Then it will not. - My second point is - Hunh - How I need for our sakshatkar, Atmasakshatkar but we might find Atmadarshan. Now Atmadarshan will come only when all our karmas are clean. Yeah. So, I tell you what is this that we call it the sprouting of the Kundalini is the beginning of Atmasakshatkar - is the beginning. A small light comes in, you see and then gradually it grows and grows and then you you get into a state, which we call as Nirvikalpa samadhi.

If you want you can call at that time Atmasakshatkara. It's no question of simply fighting with the words. No need to fight with the words. Why say Atmasakshatkara, because in the beginning the light that comes to you is also for your Atmasakshatkar so the sakshatkar starts. You see, if you should see Me from a distance or you see from here, it's the same. Once you come closer, you see Me clearly - that's all but to say that it is Atmasakshatkara, doesn't mean that it is a full fledged happening. I understood it. The Atmasakshatkara is seeing your Atma in front of you. achcha. Now what is the Atma?

The same as Parbrahma. So, seeing Parbrahma in front of you is just seeing your Atma. - Now what do You mean by ... - You don't see your Atma. If you see something, then you are not that. If you see the light, then you are not the light but you become that. Your Atma comes, the light of the Atma comes in your wisdom, which I will tell you tomorrow what happens in Atmasakshatkar - but it is the beginning of Atmasakshatkar. - Now next point is, we must spend most time, most of our time, precious time in meditation - so we should not spend our time in the rituals like homa or going to the temple etc. Am I correct? - Yes. You see, once you enter in the hall, whether you are there or here, you are entered in the hall.

Alright. When you come closer in the front, you have a better view - that's different but once you've entered in the hall you are entered in the hall. If you have jumped in the sea, you have jumped in the sea - alright? But how far you have gone with it, is a different point. So now, I think, we can have the realization of oneself. To begin with the Atmasakshatkara, which is the Kundalini awakening within us, for that I have to make humble things to you that you should also know what are the centers you have to cater and how to awaken those centers yourself. So, it's very simple, it is a very simple method which I'll tell you. So also you can raise your own Kundalini in My presence plus you will also know which are the centers you have to look after; It's very, very simple thing you have to do. Nothing strenuous or in any way difficult - it's very simple. So, as I told you, please you have to take the help of the Mother Earth, so you can take out your shoes - will help you a lot.

Just take off your shoes to touch the Mother Earth because She takes away most of our problems. And take out the chappals and shoes and just put it like this. So, best it would be that sit on the ground. If you have to sit cross-legged better to sit on the ground, just in front or put your both the legs. Surprisingly, you are sitting already as people get realization; It's the blessings of the modern sahaja yoga. Can you move forward some of you people? Better move forward - there's space - so man seats. I wanted to a question to you all. While doing this, sometimes the mind just jumps out. So, it's better now to quieten your mind.

Now, Kundalini is the power of Pure Desire. As you know, Economics says that, "Desires cannot be satisfied - not satiable in general." From one desire to another you try. So that means these desires that we have are not pure. There's only one Pure Desire and the Pure Desire is, whether you know about it or not, whether you're conscious or unconscious about it, is to be one with the Divine. Unless and until that happens, you can never be satisfied with whatever you might have. So now, you have to put your left hand towards Me - it is symbolic; This is very symbolic, saying, that you want your realization - this is a desire, this is the desire, not pure desire, the desire that you want your Self-realization. The another hand, as I told you, is the kriya, is the kriya shakti. So, we have to use it to give confidence - with our confidence to nourish ourselves, to nourish our centers on the left hand side - it is very simple. So, first you have to know that the Spirit resides in our heart, so put our hand on the heart.

The peetha of the Spirit is here, on the fontanel - peetha, is the seat but the Spirit actually resides here in human-beings, in the heart. Now, you must know that you are the Spirit - that's true but if you are the Spirit, also you are your master, your guru because your Spirit guides you. So, then you put your right hand - we've got to work on the left hand side - on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. This is the center of our guru principle, guru tatwa, left hand side. upper portion of your abdomen, over here, upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the principle of your mastery. This is been created by great saints and great masters - satgurus. Then, you have to put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen which is the center of Shudh Vidya, of Pure Knowledge. Now, this Shudh Vidya, pure knowledge manifests through your Central Nervous System. You become conscious of it, know through your awareness, work through your Central Nervous System.

Then, you have to again raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Then, you have to raise your right hand on your heart. Now, you have to raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Now, this is the center which is called a [UNCLEAR] guilt when people say [UNCLEAR]. You forget the past - you have to forgive yourself, forgive yourself absolutely. Turn your head to your right. Now, you have to put your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides and put down your head. You have to press it hard on both the sides. This is a center where you have to forgive everyone. Now, you have to take this hand on the back-side of your head and push back your head, look upward and here is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness from the All-Pervading Power but you're not to feel guilty, you're not to count your mistakes.

Then you have to stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of this fontanel bone area, which is taalu, which was a soft bone in your childhood, press properly you put it there and push back your fingers, push back your fingers and press it hard. Press it hard. Now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise, slowly, clockwise, don't move your hand but move your scalp. Vibrations through the scalp, push back your fingers - this is important - seven times because there're seven seats of these seven centers in our brain. Now, that's all we have to do. Now we have to close the eyes. Before closing the eyes, I've to tell you again and again, that we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves. We have to be prasanna because we have to enter into the Kingdom of God and we should not blame ourselves for anything, we should not be sorry for anything but in the present you're sitting here about to enter into the Kingdom of God, so you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself, not to feel guilty, not feel any way, feel diffident; Every person is capable of getting realization. Some people may not get today but [UNCLEAR] if they come to the center, all of them will get and you all can get your Kundalini properly fixed with Atmasakshatkar - no doubt about it. It has worked in thousands of people, so why not it will work in you also.

So, if you have anything black thread or anything tied or something like tight on your waist or tight on your neck, you can little bit loosen it or if there are any malas or anything - of course, mangalsutra you can have. Rest of it, any malas of, say, Rudraksha or anything like that, please take it off - that's all. Now, put the left hand towards Me. Firstly, you should be comfortable and sit in a way that is not slouching, neither very straight but in a simple manner. Put your left hand towards Me and the right hand you have to put it on your heart. Now please, close your eyes. [Hindi - Baat suno] Listen to Me. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] Now, please close your eyes and unless and until I'll tell you, please don't open your eyes because your attention has to be inside that's why please don't open your eyes. Here, you have to ask Me a question - as we ask a computer we have to ask a question - very important question - you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

Ask this question, three times, in your heart. Ask this question, three times, in your heart, "Mother am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times. [ASIDE - Just a minute, hello.] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] sit in the front. Go and see what's the matter. Now, if you are the Spirit, if you are the Spirit then, you are your master also, you are your guru. Now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard on your stomach, left hand side. Press it hard and here, you ask Me a question, "Mother, am I my own guru, Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

Please put your both feet apart from each other [UNCLEAR] We should not be [UNCLEAR], please put them apart. Ask this question now, "Mother, am I my own master, Mother, am I my own guru?" ask this question three times. Now, I respect your freedom. The Shudh Vidya or the Pure Knowledge cannot be given to you unless and until you want in your own freedom - I respect it, so now, put your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and ask by saying, "Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge." Please say it six times. Six times you should say. You should say it six times. "Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge." Six times because this center has got six petals.

As soon as you say that, your Kundalini starts moving upward. Now we have to nourish the upper centers with our confidence. Don't doubt, keep your mind open, keep your heart open, don't doubt, otherwise Kundalini will not rise. Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side Here, with full confidence, you have to say ten times, "Mother, I am my own guru, Mother, I am My own master," this is the [UNCLEAR - PROPHECY?] you are talking about. I've told you at the very outset, that the greatest Truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, you are not these emotions but you are Pure Spirit. So now, raise your right hand on your heart and here, with full confidence, you have to say, twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit." "Mother, I am the Spirit," please say it twelve times. We have to know that this All-Pervading Power is the ocean of love, of bliss and of joy.

It's the ocean of knowledge but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so whatever mistakes we commit or whatever, so called, sins we commit, can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness. So, please forgive yourselves. Now, with full confidence, put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn round your head towards the right. Here you have to say, again with full confidence, three times "Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say this. "Mother, I am not guilty at all, " please say it - this is the worst center we have and this all the kinds of problems like spondylitis, like angina. Now, we have to forgive everyone. You might say that it's not easy to forgive but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - it's a myth - and when you don't forgive, you play into wrong hands. So now, you raise your hand and put it on your forehead across and put down your head, as much as you can and press it hard. Here you have to say, without [UNCLEAR - ASKING?] whom you have to forgive or for what you have to forgive, you just - not how many times but from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

It's a very powerful center here Get rid of all the [UNCLEAR - FANTASTICAL?] ideas. Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head, as much as you can, on that line. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes and things, just for your own satisfaction you have to say, "O Paramchaitanya, O All-Pervading Power of love please forgive me if knowingly or unknowingly I've said something or I've done something which is wrong." Just say it from your heart again but don't count your mistakes, don't feel guilty. Now, stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood - it is called as taalu. Now, put down your head as much as you can, press it hard [UNCLEAR] and push back your fingers. Now, you must know [UNCLEAR] I cannot give you Self-realization, unless and until you want it in your freedom, as this freedom as this freedom has to be respected for you to get the ultimate freedom. So, you move your hand seven times clockwise saying ten times, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization." Just say it seven times moving your scalp.

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] Now, please take down your hands. Open your eyes. Put your right hand towards Me, like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your scalp but don't touch it - keep it away from it and see for yourself. It is you who has to certify; Nobody else is going to certify. Just see if there's a cool breeze coming out. Some people might get some heat - doesn't matter. After sometime it will cool down. See for yourself. Put your left hand towards Me and now again put down your head and see with your right hand. Some people get it quite far it's like this.

They just [UNCLEAR] but start getting cool breeze slowly emitting from this. We have no fans, nothing , so not to doubt. Now, again put your right hand and again put your head down and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now, raise your both hands and ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" "Is this the cool breeze of the All-Pervading Power?" " Is this the cool breeze of Param Chaitanya?" Just ask these questions, any one of them, three times, looking upwards. Now, take down your hands. Now, watch Me without thinking [UNCLEAR - IF YOU CAN DO IT?] Now, those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

So nice to see. This is the experience! Now, how to work it out? What is this Power? You have to come to our center. In any case you come tomorrow.Those who haven't felt, you have to feel tomorrow. All of you will feel it and I'll tell you clearly what is this Power and how it works. May God bless you!
