"Materialism, Nature and Balance", Evening before Navaratri Puja. Cabella (Italy), 4 October 1997.

[During the evening program, after some musical performances and a play by the English, the Swiss sahaja yogis acted in a play where they openly denounced the Swiss bank (about its money laundering etc.). Ultimately they recited the “litany for the doom of Materasura”, the demon of materialism:]

“Litany for the doom of Materasura”:

This is a world that feeds the Swiss Banks’ Octopus.

This is a world where too much is not enough.

This is a world where negativity is a plus.

This is a world where the saints say: Enough.

This is a world where 1.3 billion people live on an income of less than $1 a day and where the planet does not have enough natural resources to sustain, at a worldwide scale, the consumption pattern of Malaysia, leave alone America.

Shri Mataji: It has been such a great treat for us, not only entertainment, but the way for our future – how to move and what to do.

It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank business has been attracting My attention all the time. I don’t know much, how they can digest everything so well. In these modern times, when people are talking of democracy, talking of very big ideal things and all that, at the same time how can such a illegal system exist openly?

And for that I have a plan.

As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have a plan to do something about it.

As far as the materialism is concerned, it’s working out. All these countries who were supposed to be very advanced, developed are suffering; first from recession – and a terrible recession. That recession is going to give them a lesson about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

Materialism comes because people have gone mad with their greed. I was searching a house in England – went round to see houses, and I was surprised that all kinds of plastic things and mixed things and all that, were piled up in mountains in every house, mountains!

And you pass through a door you will find two legs of a pant falling on you.

But not only in England, same in Paris: I’ve seen people accumulating so much of nonsense that they don’t know where to put it and what to do. This madness is on and on and on.

Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja Yogis, what they should do. They should try to encourage handicrafts.

Every country I went to, I bought handicrafts, whether it was Czechoslovakia or England or anywhere. I cannot understand – how can you go and buy this rubbish of plastic, of these useless things?

And these handicrafts, when I bought, I was surprised – I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that there were small, small, very small shops and they all came, one by one, “Mother, buy something from us also, Mother buy something from us”.

You know, I was surprised, such beautiful things. They said, “We cannot sell them.”

But all nonsensical things people are buying.

So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow that “we’ll only take things which are handmade”. You need not have many things, you can have few, but something handmade.

Now, supposing you get a dress, there should be some handmade embroidery or something put it on that, so some labor is put in into that.

It is very difficult to see how people go in for things which are very cheap and extremely troublesome.

I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear nylon, I can’t wear anything artificial, really, I can’t. For a while, if I even wear socks also, My whole body starts paining. So, it is against you.

Handmade things are few, I agree, but use as far as possible handmade things. From the Mother Earth they make very nice, say, terracotta.

So, I’m a socialist by temperament, I think. So, I felt a great urge that I should really export nothing but terracotta. And terracotta is such a beautiful thing. It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells so well. But people think, “No, we should buy something that is made from America in some machinery thing.” They go on buying like that.

In America also I was surprised that beautiful things are selling in shops which they call them as outlets, very good, mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather – pure leather. But people will go to big, big markets and buy all nonsense at a very high price and not from there – means they have no wisdom.

And this is what happens, that the wisdom, if it is lacking in your sense, then this wisdom corrodes the society. Because wisdom itself shows how dangerous it is to go on buying all these nonsensical things.

Also now you are seeing that people are taking now more to Ayurveda and to homeopathy. They don’t want to use these horrible medicines produced by your great country.

You know what they do, Swiss? They send very big offers to doctors from India to come to work for them. And supposing they have produced one “A” sample as you’ve shown, then the same one they change a little bit (and) say “It’s better”. And you know these medicines, most of them are very dangerous and troublesome.

By mistake, My family gave Me these antibiotics. Since then My legs are very weak and troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

So, you see, why we are now taking to this - because pollution is there another thing, which is created by this machinery.

Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need to use so much machinery.” Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can use trains, but people want to go anywhere by motor car, even if it is about, say, ten meters, they don’t want to walk.

That’s how our health has gone down.

I must tell you when I was studying in the school, My school was about five miles. And we had a car, and we had also horses, and what we call is a buggy in our house. But it was compulsory for us to walk five miles in the morning. Evening time the car used to come, but morning time we all had to walk five miles to go to our school. And in between there was a small, little mountain which we had to climb.

That is how we learnt about nature. If you don’t walk, from the car what do you know? At the most you can see some lamppost.

What do you see from the car? Nothing, you cannot see the nature. And this walking system is very much out of date now for people. People don’t walk.

I’m not saying that today we are very changed, and we are very advanced people. In a way we have gone down because we cannot walk. God has given these legs to walk, but we cannot walk. We avoid walking. Now, because of that so many cars. I know that in some families they have five cars because 5 family members.

Especially in Spain, I was surprised, so many cars, so many cars and every car has only one person in it.

Now, problem has started with the pollution and all these things, because we have lost the habits of depending upon ourselves. Now see what has happened in, say, this Kuala Lumpur and all these places suffering from what you call, the smoke. Now I have not done it, if you think that way. And they are praying to Allah, “Give us water”. Why should God give them water when they are doing all kinds of nonsensical things? Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because they have cut the trees. So, why do they want to cut the trees? Because they want to make money, that’s all. Their wood is coming to India, because in India also they have cut the trees. If you go on like this – mad, you will have pollution, means what? Is that, destructive forces will act and stop it.

For that you don’t have to pray to the Goddess, it will work out. And it’s all working out everywhere. So, whatever you have to have, try to have something which is handmade. Even your clothes - need not be many, try to have it which are handmade - is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

There need not be to send money to this Swiss Bank also (Shri Mataji laughs). This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed now, I’m angry with them for one more thing, that they had promised that they’ll give the money to the Jews and now they are going like this (Shri Mataji moves Her hand in a gesture of faltering and uncertainty), they don’t want to give.

When they will die are they going to take it with them? All these sins will be punished and that is why I’m very happy this he has brought in, because I’ve been talking about it – even in that conference I went to in China, I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

I have talked to many magistrates and to many, what you call them, the head of the law ministry and all that, and I’ve told them, “Why not we have a conference and say that this banking is nonsense”.

Now, all types of bad people are taking advantage of this system and are trying to make money, look very nice or so, I don’t know.

So many have lost their money there, I don’t know what was the need to put all this money there. That when they die, their children do not get anything.

But the problem is this greed, is some sort of a inner defect in a human being. He becomes greedy, greedy because he has deviated from dharma. He thinks he can get pleasure out of things, he cannot. And he goes on accumulating and buying and this and that.

I would say your Mother also does that. I buy, but I buy things which are handmade. So that tomorrow, if I have to give it presents, or if I have to sell off things, even the ornaments you have given Me, I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them. What will I do with the ornaments – I have to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

My family ornaments also I’m selling, because I spent money on My family things also.

Just think of it, what is all this for, what pleasure does it give us? I can understand, if you want to give somebody a present, or somebody you want to give some happiness, joy – you should do it, but just for yourself go on, go on, how much can you digest it? You cannot.

Joy is much more in giving to others. It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you any understanding of the fundamentals, and the fundamentals is that you are dharma.

Within you is that, that is your valency, and this materialism absolutely against it, because it creates all kinds of people: mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats - we have communities after communities who are known to be cheats, who are very materialistic, they have no spiritual sense.

So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say - of course you have said all the mantras so I’m supposed to do all that.

But what you have to do is not to buy any more anything which is not handmade. Try it.

At least, there should be some embroidery, at least, there should be some work done on it.

I’m surprised that these things are not very good for us, they are injurious to our health.

So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they have to walk. They must walk and they must see the nature, what is in the nature.

Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask the name of this flower, how many of you know? It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick” (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs), apart from its botanical name.

But it is, you see, what I’m saying, everything you should know - you should know about small, small things, from where do this embroidery comes? From where does this sari comes? Our Indian men are the worst, I would say, they don’t know anything whatsoever.

But even western men also have the same problem. You must take interest in things in which you have not taken interest.

For example, Indians don’t know how to cook, they don’t know! Once My husband told Me that he knows how to cook. I said, “What?” He said, “I’ll make chapatis, rotis.” And what he made was nothing – Australia, America, this, that (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). But he said, “I give up because I was doing shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

But minute things you can see, what we call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

If you walk, look at the nature, love the trees, love the animals.

You’ll be amazed, there are so many things to be known than reading newspaper, what is there to read in the newspaper? For hours together you go on reading newspaper, next day you forget it.

You’ll be amazed that they say that for Goddess it is said that “Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every glance, She knows everything. Any glance She puts on any man, woman or anything, She knows where it is.

And if you are My children you should also try that, because I always used to run out into jungles, in the forest, I used to go to all such places and really enjoy the beautiful Mother, this Mother Earth who has created such a beautiful thing. Have you noticed just now that the colors of the background which were made by the Russians and the colors of this facing thing are just the same, they have used the same colors. It’s true collectivity.

Now, you notice in the nature it’s so matching, you know. Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s so beautiful, this is red but it has green to match it.

This Mother Earth knows everything, She understands everything, She does everything, but what do we do for Mother Earth? – Is to run after artificial things, machinery, this thing – and now a new thing has come, is computer.

It’s all right if you want to write letters to someone, but otherwise it’s quite maddening, you know. And this computer will make our brain absolutely zero. We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able to think 2 + 2.

So, anything that you want to use also, should have its maryadas, don’t go beyond it.

If you take to swimming, you’ll go on swimming till you get sick. If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on horse-riding till you fall down. You see, this is also a kind of a life which has no maryadas – like greed has no maryadas, that’s how also this kind of nonsense, “I am only fond of this, I am only fond of this.”

You are a human being, you should never say like that. On the contrary you should say “I must learn this, I must know this, what is this all about?”. It is very important, otherwise your personality will be a dwarf personality – and ultimately people end up in money.

I don’t understand. I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even. I don’t know about money, I should say. But I’m good at mathematics - but I don’t know, whatever money you are giving goes direct to them and they do it what they like.

Now, if somebody says, “How much You got for this?” “I don’t know”. “How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”, because I’m not interested. I’m not interested. What is there to be so much interested in money? But I get money, all right, no problem, never a problem.

I sold one of My ornaments and I got at least 100 times more than what I have spent.

Maybe you might say it’s vibrations, whatever you may say. So to get after money means you get very much in the clutches of money.

So what is the solution, to get rid of this greed?

Is to try and give it to others and see the joy. Give something to others, share and see the joy you feel by giving something.

I must tell you, Gregoire is not here but I am missing him because once I went to a sari shop and wanted to buy one sari but I thought “It’s rather expensive, why should I buy such an expensive sari”, came away.

And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same sari on My birthday and I was so filled with joy, because he bought it next day, went and bought it from that shop, kept it with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

These small, small things can give you great joy in giving people, other people, not yourself.

I don’t know if I have bought anything much for Myself in My lifetime, never. Even if I go out shopping, even if I am thirsty, I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself. People know that I don’t buy anything for Myself, practically nothing, but you all give Me so much, what to do.

Now, I have decided (Shri Mataji laughs) that after these 75 years of age, I shouldn’t take anything from you whatsoever. But to please you maybe, they are asking that “Only take a national, international”, all right. But no more, every country shouldn’t bring.

What after all this national, international – you are all international people, what is the need to bring any present for Me? I don’t even have time to see them. I’m so very busy with other things, because there are so many problems in this world.

So, I would suggest that, to get over all these things we should see ourselves, what we are doing about it. I’m sure none of you have money in the Swiss Bank, thank God (Shri Mataji laughs, laughter).

But never earn more than what you can – you have, there’s no need.

Whatever comes your way is all right. Of course if you are doing some work of creativity, of creating some designs, creating something is all right. But don’t buy things, go on buying things for yourself or putting then money here, hiding, hiding there, there’s no need. You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and so happy being honest, being absolutely beyond any problem.

Now this mafia business is there, I agree with you. Now this mafia can be controlled only by the government because they give such a big tax. Now I mean, for example, an artisan in this poor country - I will say poor because most of the people are suffering from tax – you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

Italians are known for their art, they make beautiful things, but they cannot because they have to pay so much taxation.

Only the designers they make the money. Designers make the money befooling everybody. They befool people so much. Once My husband went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me. So, he said, “This is designer’s.” I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is an Indian thing.” And surprisingly in the corner it was written “Made in India”. He paid £25 for that, in India you can get it for £2. (Laughter)

So, this is another thing is to run a race of eliteness. You see this one (referring to Her spectacles) was bought by My son-in-law. I said: “What is so special?” He said, “It’s very great, you know.” I didn’t know what was so special about those spectacles.

So, I went to one shop in America and they all started saying, “Madam, Madam, Madam …”.

I said, “What is so Madam about Me? (Laughter).

Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?” (Laughter)

So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him! (Laughter)

All such stupid ideas, you see, and then they bought Me a …. [Aside: “What you call that? The watch was… what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] – Patek Philippe, that watch they brought for Me and it would not run in time. I said, “What is this? (Laughter) Never keeps the time, it’s always out of time.

My vibrations (Shri Mataji laughs) must be trying some tricks”. So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba, show this to the Patek Phillips.”

(Hindi)

“This will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

I said, “Why?” “Because they think they are the best.” I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

Then I asked My daughter to have it, I said, “Baba, I can’t make … I don’t know why, maybe I will have something simple, it’s better.”

That too again turned out to be a, what you call? ‘Designers’. They are now all - most of these designers are in jail.

And some of them met Me when I was coming from Russia. They are absolutely useless people, you know. They take out some idea and sell it for a high price and if you are a fool you go and buy that. Did you notice that this is Cartier? [She is referring to her spectacles. - Laughter] For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now this is the thing is that there are, these are also mafias, I tell you, these are also mafias. And these mafias are exploiting you, I’ve written it in My book also, if you read it, how these entrepreneurs are trying to befool you. You wear simple dress, simple from handmade – will be much better than to wear something that makes you look like something out of the blue. And there is no need because it is just satisfying your ego. Some people have a habit – as soon as – say, I have, supposing some dinner set, may not be good or… - they’ll come and see the back of the dinner plate. “Ah, from where did You get it?” – “I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.” “No, no You better find out, because very nice.” Next day they’ll go round the whole place to find out if they can get the same dinner set.

And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite. I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

Once My husband liked one tea set.

So you know London has huge, big stores.

Some of them are really horrid. I went there – baarpre baap - we walked and walked and walked through so many.

They said, “All right, we promise after 6 months.” Another said, “7 months”, another said, “8 months, you give us the order.”

So I gave up the idea. Then C.P. said, “What has happened to their factories?” I said, “They don’t have anything, they are exporting.” Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed - and there for a special price, just for propagating, they had put these tea sets there. Imagine, in Australia, and I got it for the half price.

So, if you don’t have greed you get what you want just there. Just there you get it.

But if you have greed, then God makes you dance. All right? That is what is so simple as that - whatever you want you can get it, if you don’t have greed about it.

That’s such an enslaving thing within us, that we have greed. I mean I can give you 1,001 examples of that, 1,001. That if you don’t ask for anything, if you don’t desire for anything, you get what you need, whatever you need you get. But if you go on desiring, then go mad after it. Go there, get this and get lost. And then the thing also gets lost.

That’s why it is said, better try to develop a detachment. It’s all right, if it is there well and good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

Then you’ll be surprised your attention will be so subtle. Now none of you I think have seen these beautiful flowers, what are there. The beautiful embroidery that is there. The way they have done this.

Now can you tell Me how many there are, hands in this work – 14, 28.

This side 14, this side 14. I mean, inclusive of all these other things.

So you don’t notice anything and your attention becomes… “Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has been the Mahamaya”.

This is no explanation. Your attention if it is clear, is simple, you can see the thing clearly. And with that attention only, that attention yourself takes you to the right place where you have to go, you get the right thing what you want to buy.

Can you tell Me you see these carpets are from where? They are mostly from Russia. I went to Russia and I saw this carpet factory.

They have no sense of export also.

So I told them that “How much will a carpet cost?” – Doctor knows -They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba, $20 for a carpet?” So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do, we have to buy many”. I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

I said, “In India the other way round. If you have to export something, then the price is less.”

I said, “All right, so I guess we must think of the solution because I need it.” So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go and buy each one. To Russians they give for $20.

I said, “All right, you bring these.”

So, you should go in for solutions and not for problems. Greed is a problem, greed is a problem. How to get rid of the greed is the point. And to get rid of the greed is that if I buy something – for whom should I buy this one, for whom should I buy?

Ah, this will be all right for another friend of mine, like that.

If you train your mind on these lines, not for yourself, but for others, then you’ll be amazed this greed will run away and you’ll have joy.

As you want to give Me things, I understand that, I also want to give you. In the same way, think of all others, they are all brothers and sisters. From other countries, make friends with other countries. If giving is there, then this greed goes away (indistinct – sounds like “once for all”) and you get what you want.

It’s a very simple mantra. It’s surprising, so far, with all the miracles, we don’t understand that whatever we need also be provided for. But you must need it, not for stupid collection of things.

This was a very, very good thing, acted very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly, this Swiss Bank laundering. I know My country suffers from it.

Now, the another drama, which was done by the English, shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is an old, quite an old drama, which I have read long time back. 

But this is the real pilgrims they have shown, how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods, and throughout they have very nicely brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi, while rising, falls into different pits.

So it’s a very good thing for you to know that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be very careful, and you should see that you don’t fall into these pits and ultimately the ego and superego.

In the west the problem is more of ego, not of superego.

And for ego (Shri Mataji laughs), to accept that you have ego is the only way; and then it will drop out. If you know there is ego, ego will drop out.

The simple thing is to know that you have ego. Ego of something. People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

There was one lady very proud and egoistical. So I asked about her, “What is the matter with her?” “Because she knows how to make dolls” – Why? That should give you ego or what? (Shri Mataji laughs) I didn’t understand that part. But this is what it is, even for small things people have ego, and all this designing and all that is based on your stupid ego which makes you buy all these things to show off your ego.

So try to be humble – humble and try to understand that all these worldly things we are not going to take them with us. They are going to lie down here. I am not saying you renounce. I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you should know that the value of these things is nothing compared to you.

When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

You think by wearing something great you are very much influencing others.

You may, but those who are influenced are another set of fools, I must say.

Once I was wearing a ring and I went to shopping in one of the places and they were so respectful to Me.

I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers, they never respect Me because I’m an Indian – what has happened?” So I had gone to a shop where the lady was known to Me.

She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”

I said, “What do you mean, real?” “Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old from My family.” “Ah, so Your family very rich?” “No, no, it was from My forefathers, I’m just wearing that.” “Oh my God, if it is real, what will be the price?” I said, “How will I know, it was bought long time back, I don’t know the price.”

“No, can you get me one?”

I said, “Why do you want to have it, you can have this one if you like.” Like that, you know, a small thing makes them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

What is the greatest thing in us is our Spirit, is the Spirit that we have and we should know that we should be proud of it, that we have got the Spirit within us. And if you become proud, then you will not do nonsensical things. You are people who are all realized souls. And already, you have crossed over this pilgrims stage, you are much above that. Now the greatest thing is to know that we are spiritual people and as spiritual people – you even dominate Me, in a way. If you all desire for something, I can’t get over it. I have to accept. I have to keep you pleased. Many things I’m doing just because you want it; doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me because nothing comes over My head.

So it’s all right, whatever children want, let them do. But the one point is this ego has to be really under control.

There’s one little more point I want to tell you, because tomorrow I may not be able to say, in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other things, is this – I wanted to talk to people who are married in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

I think some of them are extremely dominating and stupid. What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon as they call it.

Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

Now if the women are quarrelsome, fighting, sarcastic, it is absolutely a hell for man.

Instead of that, if woman knows the essence, the honey, she should know how to please the husband, to bring peace in the family. Now some of the husbands are drunkards or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga. What pleases the husband? You see, in a way, it’s a trick. It’s a trick of a realized soul, how to please others. What do we do to our husbands?

Do we try to please? First of all find out what he likes. My husband, I would say - he’s gone away, thank God - he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear any flower in your head.” But in Maharashtra all the married women are supposed to wear flowers.

Since that day I have never worn any flower in My head. It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t know what I was, so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers, I don’t like”

Then he said, “You must wear bangles” because he comes from a very traditional family. All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases him, what’s the matter?

Little, little things you do just to please him, then he also starts thinking, “See, what should I do for My wife?”. But first it must start from woman, not from man, because women are responsible for the society.

In the western culture they had not told what is their job is.

Man’s job is economics, politics, money earning. They have made a mess out of it, I agree with you (Laughter). It’s quite a big mess (Shri Mataji laughs). But your job is to make the society. And to make the society, first you must know how to keep children pleased, how to keep your husband pleased, how to help and be close to them (Unclear).

On the contrary, if you try all the time to dominate, that’s not your job to dominate at all. Your job is to make neutralize his domination by simple, simple things.

I’ll give you an example. Thank God he is not here! (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)

He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very clever in certain things. In his office he had a gentleman. I never used to interfere with his office. But there was one gentleman, good one, who gave up his organization and joined another one because it was a private one, he was getting more money, so he joined that. But there he found it was horrible, so he wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation. But My husband is very particular about rules and regulations. He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you, I don’t want to see your face, get out”, this thing, that (thing).

So he came to Me. Normally, I never interfere. He came to Me and he said, “If You tell him he might listen.” I said, “No, if I tell him he will never listen. But I know how to do it.”

(Laughter)

So I told him that this gentleman came to see Me. “Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now are you going to trouble me about it?”

I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think why he came to Me.”

He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more generous than you are.” Immediately this competition. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs) And that fellow got the job, he was a great friend of his, even in London he was helping him a lot.

So, when we think that we have to control our husband, it’s better to do it in a very simple way. Only on fundamentals you can put down your foot. Otherwise for small, small things, if you go on dominating your husband I tell you, you will miss the point. You have married for stupidity or for honeymoon?

And in the West, especially in Italy, we have had very bad experiences of women.

English also, I must say. English girls also have given Me lot of trouble.

I mean, they are banned now, because I can’t help it.

One girl from Sri Lanka she was married to somebody in… [Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down, sit down”] - she was married to somebody in USA. Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where there’s everyday at least 30 murders, she got such a good chance to go to USA. Of course, USA’s also not a very great place - but she started behaving as if she is a childish person and talking to him in such a manner.

He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist. Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me in such a sarcastic manner and this and that, that I’m surprised.” I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t believe it!” Then he told Me what she talked to him and how she talked to him. I was amazed. I mean, no man would be happy to hear all these things. But she thought she was very friendly, and she was joking or something like that. This doesn’t work out in marriage.

Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse and beating with a whip. Why has he married? For the happiness, for the joy, for the sweetness of a woman. It’s a very important thing I wanted to talk because so many of women are thinking that they are something great. Some of them have some money, some of them have some jobs, but first job is to keep the society very happy and to keep your husband happy – is the first job. If a woman cannot keep the husband happy, she is no good for us.

She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is a place, like a man who is working in the office, he has to keep his boss pleased. If he doesn’t please his boss, he is useless, he’s thrown out of.

In the same way a woman has to think about the husband, in a very kindly manner, because this is her job, this is why she is marrying.

Otherwise she should not marry, she can do what she likes. It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone because, you see, men are right-sided, they are hot-tempered. But I have told you just now how to capture their anger.

I’ve seen also in the films, you see all romantic scenes going on – it never happens, there’s nobody is like that, you see, it’s all absurd things you see, so you expect them to be Clark Gable or somebody, it’s not so. (Laughter)

You have to love, you have to take your husband into your heart first. This is your duty, otherwise what else are you doing? I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka - and this boy has said “Mother, you can kill me, but I will not have that girl here, because she is not joy-giving.” It’s a fact.

So if your wife is like that supposing - now I am telling men. The trick of the trade is, if your wife is like that, try to understand why she does it. What is her problem, why is she dominating you?

Or you think she is dominating you. Most of the times, most of the men who talk “Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are very dominating.

Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong with you, that she is dominating?

If you introspect, you’ll find that you give very little time to her.

Now, the other part is, there was one lady, she wanted to have a divorce. I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work all the time and he is not there and this and that.” But I said, “If you divorce, then you will never be with him. So why do you want to have a divorce? At least (Shri Mataji laughs), at least he gives you some time, but if you divorce, then he’ll never be with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

I can’t understand the logic (laughter). I mean women should not be brainless, isn’t it - to say such a thing. If you want to divorce your husband for this – it’s absurd.

Now, for men it is important that they should give some time, pay some attention and get some things that they like.

Now, I’ll give you again My own example. My husband never brought any flowers for Me, you all bring flowers for Me, but he never brought any flowers for Me, whether it was birthday or anything.

Then I realized that this man has no sense of flowers (laughter). He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is any other flower. And he might bring something which is horrible, you know. Maybe (a) cactus he might bring (laughter).

It’s better he doesn’t bring anything, because that would be insulting, isn’t it? (Laughter) And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know anything about flowers, now will you tell me – except for roses, I don’t know anything.” And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses out (for that? Indistinct). So, with such an ignorance of things, if your husband doesn’t do, it shows consideration.

But men should try to know what a woman likes, what she wants. Moreover, men have their own style of thinking.

Now, (Shri Mataji laughs) to give My own example again, better it is. He buys always very expensive things. So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything for Me.” So, “You don’t like?” “No, no, I like it, but too much of these too expensive things, why should you buy?” So, he is very fond of buying these kind of sweaters from that Scotch House, very expensive they are, £250 each, you know. I don’t know how many I have, how many in black, how many, you see (Shri Mataji laughs). I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland, they are much cheaper there” and all that. Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere coat for Me, always. I must be having at least 10 of them hanging, but he likes to give that only – all right. So, I’m passing out them to My daughters, granddaughters and all that.

Then what to do now?

You see, men – he doesn’t mean anything bad, but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know. First thing he did was to, when in India, before going to the Puja, he went to buy a sari for Me. The one of My nephews went with him.

So he says (Shri Mataji laughs), “Give me the most expensive sari that you have.” So these people thought there’s somebody has come now. The shopkeepers could understand this gentleman doesn’t know anything of it (Shri Mataji laughs).

So they brought out a sari, said “This is the most expensive, the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those days this was. “All right, all right, you give me. I have a card, will you take the card?” “Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought the sari for Me. It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was something… [Hindi aside. Then She says:“That… what do you call that, arm.. – you wear…” Some yogis: “Armor” Shri Mataji: “Eh?” Some yogis: “Armor”]

Ah.

Very heavy, you know. I said, “Now what?” He said, “You must wear for the Puja.”

I was walking like a giant, you know. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)

There’s a description of your Mother is “Ati saumya Ati raudra” – She is extremely soft and extremely terrible.

But, I don’t know with that sari, how I sat!

I sat in one place glued down into that. (Laughter) Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up with that weight on My body. You see? And then I brought it and put it properly in a box and this and that. So he said, “When are you wearing that next?”

“Now,” I said, “Please, I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding, I’ll wear sometime.”

I promised him and kept it there, because he doesn’t understand about saris. I know he doesn’t understand about saris. So if he doesn’t understand, whatever he buys, I say “All right”. And he spends so much money on those things, you know, 45,000 rupees for such a sari... [Shri Mataji laughs, Hindi words]

So he doesn’t understand what is real, what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter. You have to just see his heart, how he is giving you, with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t understand. So what can you do, poor man, you know.

I always buy suit lengths for him or suits for him, I always – Myself. Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy this time.” I said, “Better buy.” He bought such a horrible one (laughter) and he went to the office and everybody said, “Sir, this is not your taste.” (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs) So he threw it away, he said, “I will never buy now, can you, better go and buy for myself.” See, it’s - but the trouble is if women take interest and know what sort of color he will like and this and that.

And also public opinion is very important for men, for example what the public says.

Like once I painted My drawing room with a very nice color, pink and black film mixed – very nice. Because it’s a sign of warmth.

He said, “What is this color you have put it, you should have done this and that”, he started shouting. I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having a party, after that I’ll change it.”

Next day the people came in, they said, “Oh, what a color, what a color, how have you made this color, how did…?” He started looking at Me. I said, “Should I remove it?” “No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.” (Laughter)

Men care for public opinion very much and you should see that you create a good public opinion in his presence, so that he’ll appreciate you. All these are tricks, you see?

I tell you, men are very simple, but you have to understand. Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter. Actually, if they are angry with somebody else, they will come and put it on you. It’s better, because if they do anything to others, they’ll beat them. You are not going to beat (them).

If you understand few things about men, it can work out. Of course, some are very miserable husbands, I know, and some miserable wives – for them we have divorce allowed in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce for them.

So that is the thing I wanted to tell you, that you should make a very good housewife, a very good Gruha Laxmi.

Now, why I am telling you this, that I am suffering from Gruha Laxmi’s chakra, and all the doctors have told Me it is because in the collective Gruha Laxmis are not all right, because they are not good housewives.

Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women. They are very good, agreed about that, but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are mad after cleanliness, women, women. You can’t talk to them even for five minutes. If you are sitting there they are picking up this, picking up that, picking up that, picking all the…, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very difficult, Swiss women. Now, I was… -

Eritrea, Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea are known to be Swiss women.

So, doesn’t matter if the house is little untidy, if there’s something fallen off. In India no woman will do that. Now, the guests are sitting and she’s with the Hoover. (Laughter)

Like another thing is (Shri Mataji laughs), like anything breaks, say, supposing the thermometer breaks – in India they’ll say, “Very good, now there will be no temperature, thermometer’s broken.” (Laughter) But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very surprising, supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest, immediately they’ll bring the Hoover, bring something to clean it – in the presence of the person. Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

It’s not important. This is a very subtle type of materialism, I think, that the person is sitting there, who is a guest, and why are you trying to do all these things in her presence or in his presence? But this Western women never understand.

Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian house. Their color scheme is different. If you go to south Indians theirs is different.

Everybody has their own taste. As soon as they will enter – Western women – “What a color scheme! What a thing you have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.” Immediately they will criticize on the face.

So another point is that you must always consider the feelings of others.

Woman is there to give proper understanding of feelings of others, what they think.

Or they go to an Indian house which will be smelling of their food, “Huh” (indicating a nasty smell). They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy the food, but they’ll try to show, to show that it is something lower.

This is very Western, I must say. If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately they’ll pass a remark. Very Western idea.

You will not find good Indians doing that, I don’t know about the modern Indians what sort of things they are.

But immediately they’ll say things which will hurt. This is not the way a woman should look. On the contrary, always praise – what’s the harm? By praising something you are not losing your business. By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm? You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know. Really enjoy your sweetness. It’s not telling lies, not to be that honest also necessary.

Because you don’t like something you must say, “I don’t like it.” This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.

“I like this and I don’t like that.” If I, say, saying that, how many will remain in Sahaja Yoga? So it’s very important to drop this “I like it, I don’t like it.” Who are you to like or not like? What about your Spirit?

What about your heart?

So again the same thing comes to, that women have to have a heart, very large heart, beautiful heart. And your Guru is a Mother, so you have to be wonderful mothers and wonderful wives and should have very, very large hearts.

So that all this selfishness, even this bank will collapse if you do that. It is existing because we have small hearts. If you have large hearts this will collapse – isn’t it? I have said it, especially because I’ve had many complaints about the women who are married here, some Indian women also. That’s why I’m telling you.

Best reports are about Russian women I must say, very, very good reports about them. They are very satisfied souls, they want very little, they are not greedy. It’s surprising, communism has done so much good to them. It’s not communism, but the extremities of communism has thrown them into that area where they don’t have any sense of possession, they don’t have.

Their government said, “All right, you can have your flats and look after them.” Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.” Government servants were told that “you can have your cars”. Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d better have.” Because just to own the car is such a headache – they know. Let the government have the headache. They are not, you know, sort of people who are even conscious of possessiveness.

Of course, now, they had some funny people. I’m forgetting his name, who was finance minister you had, and he was in Geneva, where he learned all the tricks of the trade and he brought forth lots of reforms, so-called. So now Leningrad and Moscow have become very expensive places – thanks to Swiss influence.

So this has happened there also, but still the people are very good, and the ladies who come from there, even Romanian girls are very much respected, now everybody wants Romanian or Russians, or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t come, we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing them all.

Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s a very good book, Arun Apte has written. This is the book. You all should buy it. I don’t know, what is the price you have put it? [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about the book and its price] Alright.

So, those who want to have this book should apply. There are only five, are here, very good book. So, you will understand about Indian music.

It is said that this music has come from Omkara. And it is very sort of – sensible music. Now, I think all those musicians who sang before Me, who were singing western song, was alright. But what is missing in that: melody. It’s not melodious.

You see, is like little bit you sing, then you sing this, then you shout, then you bring it down, then do like this. And they think that they have to sing through their heart. They have to express the feeling of their heart. Now, supposing somebody is dejected, so he sings the song of dejection. Then another one who is talking about love, he starts to sing a song. He may not be, but artificially they want to produce that effect. There is no need; to sing in parts, like one word, then one word, there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow in it.

And, while, Russian songs, though they were folk songs, were very melodious. But don’t worry, Americans are invading that part also. They are having all this horrible music there.

Now, the music means, it should please you.

It should give you more entertainment; not to make you unhappy, not to make you sad. If you have all these feelings within you, then you should try to say like this: “Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get over it.” Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have to show the victory; the victorious nature of yours, in your music. 

I’m not talking about others; they go on crying, weeping and singing. But there is no melody first of all, it is just part, part, part, part.

Even the orchestra, which I was surprised: it all goes like this “ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes “ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”. But Indian orchestra, you will see, is melodious. It flows like a river.

So, this difference is very bad.

So, I would request all the musicians who are singing, the singing doesn’t mean that you use words which nobody can understand. Words must be clear-cut and the melody must be there.

Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody but words are not important. So, you enjoy the tune and everything, whether you know the language or not, doesn’t matter.

So, when you can combine melody with western music, you will see how different it will be.

And this book will teach you. This is a very good book, which you should have, and which you should understand that how the music can cure you, music can give you joy, what is the basic, the essence of music.

And then you can flower it out. I am sure, if Indian musicians take to western music, will be much better than to western music as it is. I can’t understand, these people are so famous and people think they are very well-earning and all that. In America, anybody can earn like that, but to make it a proper music, I think you must have the basis of Indian music.

Then you can expand it as you like.

Now, please try to buy this book, to understand Indian music.

There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be much more than normal, so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they might bring more.

Eh? Ganapatipule. [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know when the book will be available] Accha. I will try to get more of these, but this you must really read, because you will know what is the essence of music, alright?

And, lastly, today is the 4th day of Navaratri and they have given Me - some of them are names which are really horrid, but they must be people who have suffered so much and they asked Mother to kill those horrible rakshasas.

Now in a way, it all will kill in its natural course, I know that. If you people take to sense, because you are the ones who can do it.

If you do not try to acquire things which you don’t want, unnecessary things. If you try to reduce all these things and take to something natural and love the Mother Earth, I am sure it will work out. The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

You know this earthquake. Now nobody is going in the church. But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother Earth. Now nobody goes in the church. What - I didn’t do anything, I would not. I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but see now how the nature is working out.

Now Islamic people, these Islamic people from Indonesia onward, all these people are suffering from the smoke – I didn’t do that. Because when you try to do something wrong it comes back to you. Action has a reaction.

So, your faces should be Sahaj.

You should be Sahaj. You shouldn’t look like strained people. I can’t understand. You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.

I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time, but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak all these things to you. And you should try to think about it, that “Our Mother loves me, She wants us to have a good family, She wants us to look after our children.” So, I have advised all the men, as well as the women. It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s no harm.

But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are hen-pecked. See, they are – just to please your wife, what’s the harm? But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you. That’s not the thing.

Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must go to my mother’s house”. All these kind of things you should not permit.

But women should also understand, her family is more important than father, mother, even Mataji. Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy family.

So, thank you very much.
