4th day of Navaratri, “Materialism, Nature and Marriage”, Evening before Navaratri Puja. Cabella (Italy), 4 October 1997.

[During the evening program, after some musical performances and a play by the English, the Swiss sahaja yogis acted in a play where they openly denounced the Swiss bank (about its money laundering etc.). Ultimately, they recited the “litany for the doom of Materasura”, the demon of materialism:]

“Litany for the doom of Materasura”:

This is a world where too much is not enough.

This is a world where negativity is a plus.

[TALK BEGINS HERE]

It has been such a great treat for us, not only entertainment but the way, for our own future, how to move and what to do. It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank business has been attracting my attention all the time. I don’t know much how they can digest everything so well. In these modern times, when people are talking of democracy, talking of very big ideal things and all that, at the same time, how can such an illegal system exist openly? And for that, I have a plan, as Arnaud has said, I have to expose, I have a plan to do something about it. As far as the materialism is concerned, it’s working out. (1.27)

All these countries who were supposed to be very advanced, developed, are suffering first from recession; and a terrible recession. That recession is going to give them a lesson about overproduction of nonsensical goods. Materialism comes because people have gone mad with their greed.

I was searching a house in England, went round to see houses and I was surprised that all kinds of plastic things and mixed things and all that, were piled up in mountains in every house; mountains! And you passed through a door; you would find two legs of a pant falling on you. But not only in England, same in Paris, I’ve seen people accumulating so much of nonsense, that they don’t know where to put it and what to do. This madness is on, and on and on. Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja Yogis, what they should do. They should try to encourage handicrafts. Every country I went to, I bought handicrafts. Whether it was Czechoslovakia or England or anywhere. I cannot understand, how can you go and buy this rubbish of plastic, of these useless things.

And these handicrafts, when I bought, I was surprised. I must tell you about Czechoslovakia, that there were small, small, very small shops, and they all came one by one: “Mother, buy something from us also. Mother, buy something from us.” You know, I was surprised, such beautiful things. They said: “We cannot sell them.” But all nonsensical things, people are buying.

So, for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow, that we’ll only take things that are hand-made. You need not have many things. You can have few; but something hand-made. Now supposing you get a dress. There should be some hand-made embroidery or something put on that. So, some labour is put into it. It is very difficult to see how people go in for things which are very cheap and extremely troublesome.

I must tell you one thing; I cannot wear nylon. I can’t wear anything artificial. Really, I can’t. For a while, if I wear socks also, my whole body starts paining. So, it is against. Handmade things are few, I agree. But use as far as possible hand-made things. From the Mother Earth, they make very nice, say terracotta. So, I am a socialist by temperament, I think, so I felt a great urge that I should really export nothing but terra-cotta. And terracotta is such a beautiful thing. It’s so soothing, it’s so good, it smells so well. But people think: “No, we should buy something that is made from America, in some machinery thing.” They go on buying like that. 

In America also, I was surprised that beautiful things are selling in shops that they call “Outlets”. Very beautiful; mostly of silk and cotton. And leather, pure leather. But people will go to big, big markets and buy all nonsense at a very high price, and not from there. Means they have no wisdom. And this is what happens, that the wisdom, if it is lacking in your sense, then this wisdom corrodes the society; because wisdom itself shows how dangerous it is to go on buying these nonsensical things. Also, now you are seeing that people are taking more to Ayurveda and to homoeopathy. They don’t want to use these horrible medicines produced by your great country. You know what they do, Swiss? They send very big offers to doctors from India to come and work for them. And supposing they have produced one sample, as you have shown, then the same one, they change a little bit and say: “It’s better.” And you know, these medicines, most of them are very dangerous and troublesome. By mistake, my family gave Me these antibiotics. Since then, my legs are very weak and troublesome. I have improved, no doubt.

So, you see why we are now taking to this? Because pollution is there, another thing which is created by all these machineries. Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need to use so much machinery.” Now, motor car: we can walk, we can use trains. But people want to go anywhere by motor car, even if it is about, say, ten meters. They don’t want to walk. That’s why our health has gone down.

I must tell you; when I was studying in the school, my school was about five miles. And we had a car, and we had also horses and what you call as a buggy, in our house. But it was compulsory for us to walk five miles in the morning. Evening time, the car used to come. But morning time, we all had to walk five miles to go to our school. And in between, there was a small little mountain which we had to climb. That is how we learned about nature. If you don’t walk, from the car, what do you know? At the most, you can see some lamppost. What do you see from the car? Nothing. You cannot see the nature. This walking system is very much out of date now for people. People don’t walk. I am not saying that today we are very changed and we are very advanced people. In a way, we have gone down. Because we cannot walk.

God has given these legs to walk, but we cannot walk. You avoid walking in the end. Now, because of that, so many cars! I think that in some families, they have five cars, because there are five family members. Specially in Spain, I was surprised. So many cars, so many cars, and every car has only one person. Now the problem has started with the pollution and all these things, because we have lost the habit of depending upon ourselves.

Now, see what happened in, say, Kuala Lumpur and all these places, suffering from what you call the ( smoke) smog. Now, I have not done it, if you think that way. And they pray to Allah: “Give us water.” Why would God give them water if they are doing all kinds of nonsensical things? Now, there is the smoke going on. Why? Because they have cut the trees. Why do they want to cut the trees? Because they want to make money. That’s all. And their wood is coming to India, because in India also, they have cut the trees. If you go on like this, mad, you’ll have pollution, means what? Is that destructive forces will act and stop it.

For that, you don’t have to pray to Goddess. It will work out. And it’s all working out everywhere. So, whatever you have to have, try to have something which is handmade. Even your clothes need not be many, try to have it which are handmade. It’s one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do. They need not be- to send money to this Swiss bank also. This Swiss bank will be very badly exposed now, I’m angry with them for one more thing: that they had promised that they would give the money to the Jews, and now they are going like this, they don’t want to give. When they will die, are they going to take it with them?

All these sins will be punished. And that is why I am very happy that he has brought it, because I have been talking about it even in that conference I went to in China, I talked openly about the Swiss Bank.

I have talked to many magistrates and to many, what do you call them: the head of the Law Ministry and all that, and I told them: “Why not, we have a conference and say that this banking is nonsense?” Now, all types of bad people are taking advantage of this system and are trying to make money, look very nice, or I don’t know.

So many have lost their money there. I don’t know what was the need to put all this money there, that when they die, their children do not get anything. But the problem is this greed, it’s some sort of an inner defect in the human being. He becomes greedy; greedy, because he has deviated from dharma. He thinks he can get pleasure out of things. He cannot. And he goes on accumulating and buying, and this and that.

I would say, your Mother also does that: I buy. But I buy things that are handmade. So that tomorrow, if I have to give it as presents, or if I have to sell off things, even the ornaments you have given Me, I didn’t know what to do, I am selling them. What will I do with the ornaments?  I have to buy so many ashrams, this, that. My family ornaments also I am selling. Because I spend money on my family things also. This is, just think of it, what is all this for? What pleasure does it give us? I can understand, if you want to give somebody a present, or somebody you want to give some happiness, joy, you should do it. But just for yourself, go on, go on, how much can you digest it? You cannot. Joy is much more in giving to others.

It’s not a thing that gives you any understanding of the fundamentals. The fundamentals is that you are dharma. Within you is that, that is your valency. And this materialism is absolutely against it. Because it creates all kinds of people: mafias, the Swiss bank, the cheats. We have communities after communities who are known to be cheats, who are very materialistic. They have no spiritual sense.

So, for Sahaja Yogis, I would say- of course, you have said all the mantras, so I am supposed to do all that. But what you have to do is not to buy any more anything which is not handmade. Try it. At least, there should be some embroidery, at least there should be some work done on it. I am surprised that these things are not so very good for us, they are injurious to our health.

So, Sahaja Yogis must learn that they have to walk. They must walk. And they must see the nature, what is in the nature. Many of you don’t know, say, I asked the name of this flower; how many of you know? It’s a very sweet name: “kiss me quick”, apart from its botanical name. But it is, you see, what I am saying, everything you should know. You should know about small, small things: from where this embroidery comes, from where the sari comes.

Our Indian men are the worst. I would say, they don’t know anything whatsoever. But even Western men also have the same problem. You must take interest in things in which you have not taken interest.

For example, Indians don’t know how to cook. They don’t know. Once, my husband told Me that he knows how to cook. I said: “What?” He said: “I’ll make chapatis.” And what he made was nothing: Australia, America, this, that. But he said: “I give up. Because I was doing shipping, thus shipping means shipping.” But minute things, you can see, what we call, is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

If you walk, look at the nature, love the trees, love the animals. You’ll be amazed, there are so many things to be known, than reading newspaper. What is there to read in the newspaper? For hours together, you go on reading newspaper, next day you forget it.

You’ll be amazed that, for Goddess it is said that: “Kataksha, kataksha, niriksha.” “Every glance, She knows everything.” Any glance She puts on any man, woman or anything, She knows where it is. And if you are my children, you should also try that. Because I always used to run out in the jungles, in the forests, I used to go to all such places, I really enjoy the beautiful Mother, this Mother Earth who has created such a beautiful thing.

Have you noticed just now that the colours of the background which was made by the Russians, and the colours of this facing thing, are just the same? They have used the same colours. It’s through collectivity. Now, you notice, in the nature, it’s so matching, you know; nothing gross, nothing loud. It’s so beautiful: this is red, but it has green to match it. This Mother Earth knows everything, She understands everything, She does everything. But what do we do for Mother Earth? It is to run after artificial things, machinery, this thing. And now, a new thing has come, it’s computer.

It’s alright if you want to write letters to someone. But otherwise, it’s quite maddening. And this computer will make our brain absolutely zero. It will be paralyzed; we won’t be able to think two plus two.

So, anything that you want to use, also, should have its maryadas. Don’t go beyond it. If you take to swimming, you’ll go on swimming till you get sick. If you are horse-riding, you will go on horse-riding till you fall down. See, this is also a kind of a life which has no maryadas. Like greed has no maryadas, that’s how all these kinds of nonsense: “I’m only fond of this, I’m only fond of this”. You are a human being; you should never say like that. On the contrary, you should say: “I must learn this; I must know this. What is this all about?” It is very important. Otherwise, your personality will be a dwarf personality. And ultimately, people end up in money. I don’t understand.

I cannot even count two hundred notes. Cannot even. I don’t know about money, I should say. But I am good at mathematics. But I don’t know. Whatever money you are giving goes direct to them, and they do with it whatever they like. And somebody says: “How much you got for this?” “I don’t know.” “How much for royalties?” “I don’t know.” Because I am not interested. I am not interested. What is there to be so much interested in money? But I get money alright, no problem; never a problem. I sold one of my ornaments and I got at least one hundred times more than I have spent. Maybe you might say it is vibrations, whatever you may say. So, to get after money means you get very much in the clutches of money. So, what is the solution to get rid of this greed? It is to try and give it to others and see the joy. Give something to others. Share and see the joy you feel by giving something.

I must tell you, Grégoire isn’t here but I am missing him, because once I went to a sari shop and wanted to buy one sari. But I thought it’s rather expensive. Why should I buy such an expensive sari? Came away. And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same sari on my birthday. And I was so thrilled with joy! Because he bought it; next day he went and bought it from that shop, kept it with him and on my birthday, he gave it to Me. These small, small things can give you great joy, in giving people, other people, not yourself.

I don’t know if I have bought anything much for myself in my lifetime; never. Even if I go out shopping and I am thirsty, I don’t even buy one coca cola for myself. People know I don’t buy anything for myself; Practically nothing, but you all give Me so much, what to do?

Now, I have decided that after these seventy-five years of age, I shouldn’t take anything from you, whatsoever. But to please you maybe, they are asking that only take national, international... “Alright, but no more. Every country shouldn’t bring. After all, there is national, international, you are all international people, what is the need to bring any present for Me? I don’t even have time to see them. I am so very busy with other things, because there are so many problems in this world.

So, I would suggest that, to get over all these things, we should see ourselves what are we doing about it? I am sure none of you have money in the Swiss bank, thank God. But never earn more than you have; there is no need. Whatever comes your way, is alright. Of course, if you are doing some work of creativity, of creating some designs, of creating something, it is alright. But don’t buy, go on buying things for yourself or putting the money here, hiding, hiding there. There is no need. You see, you’ll be so satisfied and so happy being honest, being absolutely beyond any problems.

Now this Mafia business is there, I agree with you. Now, this Mafia can be controlled only by the government, because they give such a big tax. Now for example, an artisan, in this poor country, I will say poor because most of the people are suffering from tax; here, you have to pay two hundred and sixty-five types of taxes. Italians are known for their art. They make beautiful things. But they cannot, because they have to pay so much taxation. Only the designers, they make the money. Designers make the money, befooling everybody. They befool people so much!

Once, my husband went to Cairo and got one scarf for Me. So, he said: “This is designer’s”. I said: “This looks Indian to Me; this is an Indian thing.” And surprisingly, in the corner is written “made in India”. He paid twenty-five pounds for that, and in India, you can get it for two pounds.

So, this is another thing, to run a race of eliteness. You see, this one was bought by my son-in-law. I said: “What is so special?” “This is very great, you know.” I didn’t know what was so special about those spectacles. So, I went to one shop in America, and they all started saying: “Madam, madam, madam...” What is so “madam” about Me? Why are they calling Me “madam”? “Oh, you don’t know?” they said. “This is Cartier!”

I said: “What is Cartier?” So, I am going to put “Kartikeya against him”.

[Laughter.]

All such stupid ideas. You see, and then, they bought Me a watch “Patek Philippe”. That watch, they bought for Me. And it would not run-in time. I said: “What is this? It never keeps the time. It’s always out of time.” My vibrations must be doing some tricks. So, I gave it to one of them and I said: “Baba, show this thing to the Patek Philippes.” (27.14) Ah, that time, Mathias was there. “This will hit their ego, Mother, very much.” I said: “Why?” “Because they think they are the best.” I said: “Whatever it is, tell them to change it, it doesn’t keep time.” Then I asked my daughter to have it. I said: “Baba, I don’t know why, I think maybe I am going to have something simple.”

That again turned out to be what you call “designer’s”. They are now, most of these designers are in jail. And some of them met Me when I was coming from Russia. They are absolutely useless people. They take out some idea and sell it for a high price. If you are a fool, you go and buy that. Did you notice that this is Cartier? For Sahaja Yogis are simple people.

Now, the thing is these are also Mafias. I tell you these are also Mafias, and these Mafias are exploiting you, I have written it in my book also, if you read it, how these entrepreneurs are trying to befool you. You wear a simple dress, simple, hand-made, will be much better than wear something that will make you look like something out of the blue. And there is no need, because it is just satisfying your ego. Some people have a habit, as soon as... say I have, supposing, some dinner set. They’ll come and see the back of the dinner plates:

“Ah, from where did you get?”

“I don’t know. I think somebody gave Me; I don’t know, I don’t know.”

“No, no, you’d better find out, because it’s very nice.”

Next day, they’ll go round the whole place, to find out if they can get the same dinner set. And Sahaja Yoga is just opposite, I tell you; you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

Once, my husband liked one tea set. So, you know, London has big, huge big stores. Some of them are really horrid. I went there; we walked and walked and walked through so many! They said: “Alright, we promise after six months.” Another said: “Seven months.” Another said: “Eight months.”

I gave up the idea. Then C.P. said, “What happened to their factories?” I said, “They don’t have anything, they are exporting.” Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed. And there, for a special price, just for propagating, they have put these tea sets there. Imagine, in Australia! And I got it for the half price. So, if you don’t have greed, you get what you want, just there. Just there you get it. But if you have greed, then God makes you dance. Alright. That is so simple as that. Whatever you want, you can get it if you don’t have greed about it. That’s such an enslaving thing within us, that we have greed!

I mean, I can give you a thousand and one examples about that. Thousand and one. That if you don’t ask for anything, don’t desire for anything, you get what you need. Whatever you need, you get. But if you go on desiring, if you go mad after it, go there, get these, and get lost. And then, the thing also gets lost. That’s why it’s said, better try to develop a detachment. It’s alright if it is there, very good; if it is not there, it doesn’t matter. Then you’ll be surprised, your attention will be so subtle.

Now, none of you, I think, has seen these beautiful flowers, that are here. The beautiful embroidery that is there; the way they have done this. Now, can you tell Me how many there are hands in this one? Fourteen; twenty-eight. This side – fourteen, this side – fourteen. I mean inclusive of all these other things. So, you don’t notice anything. And your attention becomes in the Mahamaya. This is no explanation; your attention, if it is clear and simple, you can see the things clearly. And with that attention only, that attention yourself takes you to the right place you have to go, you get the right thing, what you have to buy.

Can you tell Me, these carpets are from where? They are mostly from Russia. I went to Russia and I saw this carpet factory. They have no sense of export, also. So, I told them: “How much will a carpet cost?” They said: “Only twenty dollars.” I said: “Baba, only twenty dollars for a carpet?” So, I told doctor: “What to do, now we have to buy many.” I said: “How much for export?” “Two hundred dollars.” I said: “In India, it’s the other way round: if you have to export something, then the price is less.” I said: “Alright, so I guess we must think of a solution”, because I needed. So, I asked about twenty Sahaja Yogis to buy each, one. To Russians, they give for twenty dollars. I said: “Alright, you bring this.” So, you should go in for solutions, and not for problems.

Greed is a problem. How do you get rid of the greed is the point? And to get rid of the greed, if I buy something, “For whom should I buy this one? For whom should I buy? Ah, this would be alright for another friend of mine.” Like that; if you train your mind along these lines, not for yourself, but for others, you will be amazed, this greed will run away. And you’ll have joy. As you want to give Me things, I understand that. I also want to give you. In the same way, think of all others. They are all brothers and sisters. From other countries, make friends with other countries. If giving is there, then this greed goes away; and you get what you want. It’s a very simple mantra. It’s surprising, so far, with all the miracles, we don’t understand that whatever we need, will also be provided for all. But you must need it. Not for stupid collection of things.

This was a very, very good thing, acted very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly, this Swiss bank laundering. I know, my country suffers from it. Now, the other drama which was done by the English, “The Pilgrim’s Progress”, is an old, quite an old drama, which I have read long time back. But this is the real pilgrims, they have shown how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods; and throughout, they very nicely brought in how, even a Sahaja Yogi, while rising, falls into different pits. It’s a very good thing for you to know that, if you are a Sahaja Yogis, you should be very careful and you should see that you don’t fall into these pits, and ultimately the ego and superego. (36:38)

In the west the problem is more of ego, not of superego. And for ego, to accept that you have ego is the only way; and then it will drop out. If you know there is ego, ego will drop out. The simple thing is to know that you have ego; ego of something. People have ego of any nonsense, you know. There was one lady, very proud and egoistical. So, I asked about her, what is the matter with her.  “Because she knows how to make dolls.” Why, that should give you ego, or what? I didn’t understand that part. But this is what it is. Even for small things, people have ego. And all this designing and all that, is based on your stupid ego, which makes you buy all this to show off your ego. So, try to be humble; humble, and try to understand that all these worldly things, we are not going to take them with us. They are going to lie down here. I am not saying, you renounce. I am not saying you take sanyasa. But you should know that the value of these things is nothing compared to you. When ego comes, this idiocy comes in. You think, by wearing something great, you can very much influence others. You may, but those who are influenced are another set of fools, I must say.

Once I was wearing a ring and I went shopping in one of the places. And they were so respectful to Me, I said, “Suddenly, the shopkeepers, they never respected Me because I am an Indian, what has happened?” So, I had gone to a shop where the lady was known to Me. She said: “May I ask you, is this real?” I said: “What do you mean, real?”

“Is it real emerald?”

“Yes, yes, very old, from my family.”

“Ah, is your family very rich?”

“No, no, it was from my forefather. I am just wearing that.”

“My God, if it is real, what will be the price?”

“How will I know? It was bought a long time back. I don’t know the price.”

“No, can you get me one?”

“Why do you want to have it? You can have this one if you like.”

Like that, you know, a small thing makes them think that you are so great. What is the greatest thing within us is our Spirit? The Spirit that we have. And we should know that we should be proud of it, that we have got the Spirit within us. And if we will be proud, we will not do nonsensical things. You are people who are all realized souls. And already you have crossed over this pilgrim stage; you are much above that. Now, the greatest thing is to know that we are spiritual people, and as spiritual people, you even dominate Me, in a way. If you all desire for something, I cannot get over it. I have to accept. I have to keep you pleased. Many things I am doing just because you want it. Doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter to Me because nothing comes over my head. So, it’s alright. Whatever the children want, let them do it. But the one point is, this ego has to be really under control.

There is one little more point, I would like to tell you; because tomorrow, I may not be able to say, in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other things. Is this, I wanted to talk to people who are married in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies. I think some of them are extremely dominating and stupid. What is marriage? Marriage is honey-moon, as they call it. Honey is the essence and moon is the peace. Now, if the women are quarrelsome, fighting, sarcastic, it is absolutely a hell for men. Instead of that, if woman knows the essence, the honey, she should know how to please the husband, to bring peace in the family. Now, some of the husbands are drunkards, or anything. Not in Sahaja Yoga. What pleases the husband, you see, in a way, it’s a trick. It’s a trick of a Realized soul: how to please others. What do we do to our husbands? Do we try to please? First of all, try to find out what he likes.

My husband, I would say, he is gone away, thank God, he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear any flower in Your head.” But in Maharashtra, all the married women are supposed to wear flowers. Since that day, I never wore any flower in my head. It’s alright, it doesn’t matter. He didn’t know what I was, so he said: “Don’t wear any flowers.” I don’t wear. Then he said: “You must wear bangles.” Because he comes from a very traditional family. All my life, I wore bangles. It pleases him, what’s the matter? Little, little things you do, just to please him. Then he also starts thinking, “What should I do for my wife?” But first, it must start from women, not from men. Because women are responsible for the society.

In the Western culture, they are not told what their job is. Man’s job is economics, politics, money-earning. They have made a mess out of it, I agree with you, quite a big mess. But your job is to make the society. And to make the society, first you must know how to keep children pleased, how to keep your husband pleased, how to help people. On the contrary, if you try all the time to dominate, that’s not your job to dominate at all. Your job is to make, neutralize his domination. By simple, simple things. I’ll give an example. Thank God he is not here. He knows I am very clever in certain things. In his office, he had a gentleman. I never used to interfere with his office, but there was one gentleman, a good one, who gave up his organization and joined another one; because it was a private one, he was getting more money, so he joined it. But he found it was horrible. So, he wanted to come back to the shipping corporation.

But my husband is very particular about rules and regulations. He said, “No, no, no! Now I won’t have you. Get out!” So, he came to Me. Normally, I never interfere. He came to Me and he said: “If you tell him, he might listen.” I said, “No, if I tell him, he will never listen! But I know how to do it.”

So, I told him that this gentleman had come to see Me. “Ha, so he has come to the right person. Now, are you going to trouble me about it?”

“No, no, no. Not at all! But just think why he came to Me?”

He said: “Why?”

“Because he thinks that I am more generous than you are.”

Immediately this competition. [Laughter]

And that fellow got the job, he was a great friend of his, even in London, he was helping him a lot.

So, when we think that we have to control our husband, it is better to do it in a very simple way. Only on fundamentals, you can put down your foot. Otherwise, for small, small things if you go on dominating your husband, I tell you, you will miss the point. You were married for stupidity or for honey-moon?

And in the West, especially in Italy, we have very bad experience of women. English also, I must say. English girls also have given Me a lot of trouble. I mean, they are banned now; because I cannot help it.

One girl from (Celon) Sri Lanka, she was married to somebody from the USA. Imagine, from that horrible Sri Lanka where there is every day at least thirty murders, she got such a good chance to go to the USA. Of course, USA is also not a very great place. But she started behaving as if she is a childish person and talking to him in such a manner. He told Me, “Mother, she is a sadist. Whenever I telephone to her, she talks to me in such a sarcastic manner, and this, and that, that I am surprised.” I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I cannot believe it.” Then he told Me what she talked to him and how she talked to him. I was amazed. I mean, no man would be happy to hear all these things. But she thought she was very friendly, and she was joking, or something like that. This doesn’t work out in marriage.

Man doesn’t want a wife to be on a horse and beat him with a whip. Why has he married? For the happiness, for the joy, for the sweetness, of a home. It is a very important thing I wanted to talk, because so many of women are thinking that they are something great. Some of them have some money, some of them have some jobs. First job is to keep the society very happy and to keep your husband happy. That is the first job. If a woman cannot keep the husband happy, she is no good for us. She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is a place like man who is working in the office, he has to keep his boss pleased. If he doesn’t please his boss, he is useless, he is thrown out. In the same way, a woman has to think about the husband in a very kindly manner. Because this is her job. This is why she is married. Otherwise, she should not marry, she can do what she likes.

It is a difficult thing to convince anyone. Because, you see, men are right sided, they are hot tempered. But I have told you just now how to capture their anger. I have seen also in the films, you see, all romantic scenes going on. It never happens. Nobody is like that. You see, it is all absurd things you see, so you expect them to be Clark Gable or somebody; it is not so. You have to love. You have to take your husband into your heart first. This is your duty.  Otherwise, what else are you doing?

I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka. And this boy said, “Mother, you can kill me but I will not have that girl. She is not joy-giving.” It is a fact. So, if your wife is like that, supposing, now I am telling men. The trick of the trade is, if your wife is like that, try to understand why she does it. What is her problem? Why she dominates you? Or you think she dominates you. Most of the men who talk,” Wives are like this, wives are like that...”, they are very dominating. Why she is dominating you? What is wrong with you, that she is dominating? If you introspect, you will find that you give very little time to her.

Now, the other part is, there was one lady, she wanted to have a divorce. I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work all the time and he is not there, and this and that.” But I said, “If you divorce, then you will never be with him. So, why do you want to have a divorce? At least he gives you some time. But if you divorce, he will never be with you, so why do you want a divorce?” I cannot understand the logic. I mean, women should not be brainless, to say such a thing! If you want to divorce your husband for this, it is absurd.

Now, for men it is important that they should give some time, pay some attention and get some things that they like. Now, I will give you again my own example. My husband never bought any flowers for Me. You all bring flowers for Me. But he never brought any flowers for Me, whether it was birthday or anything. Then I realized that this man has no sense of flowers. He doesn’t know what is a rose, or what is any other flower. And he might bring something which is horrible, you know. Maybe cactus he might bring. So, it is better that he doesn’t bring anything because it could be insulting, isn’t it? And then, one day, he admitted, “I don’t know about flowers. Will you tell me? Except for roses, I don’t know anything.” And you’ll be amazed, even roses he misses out. So, with such an ignorance of things, if your husband doesn’t do, it shows consideration.

But men should try to know what a woman likes, what she wants. Moreover, men have their own styles of thinking. Now, to give my own example again, better is. He buys always very expensive things. So, I told him, “Don’t buy anything for Me.” “You don’t like?”  “No, no, I like it. But too much of these expensive things. What should you buy?”

So, he is very fond of buying this kind of sweaters from that Scotch House. Very expensive, they are two hundred and fifty pounds each, you know? I don’t know how many I have. How many in black, how many... I told him I will get them from Switzerland, they are much cheaper there, and all that. Then another is, he wants to buy cashmere coat for me, always! I must be having at least ten of them in hanging. But he likes to give that only. Alright. So, I am passing out them to my daughters, grand-daughters and all that. What to do now? You see, men... He doesn’t mean anything bad. But because he doesn’t know; doesn’t know.

First thing he did was to, in India, before going to the puja, he went to buy a sari for Me. One of my nephews went with him. So, he says, “Give me the most expensive sari that you have.” So, these people thought that, “Somebody has come now!” The shop people couldn’t understand this gentleman doesn’t understand anything about it. So, they brought out a sari, they said, “It is the most expensive. The price is forty-five thousand rupees.” In those days. He said, “Alright, alright, you give me. I have a card; will you take the card?” “Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought a sari. It is so heavy; it is so heavy that it is something- [Hindi aside]

Shri Mataji: That... what do you call that, arm..

Some Yogis: Armor.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Some Yogis: Armor.

Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know. I said, “Now, what?” He said, “You must wear for the puja.” I was walking like a giant, you know. There’s a description of your Mother: “Ati Saumya, Ati Raudra.” “She is extremely soft and extremely terrible.” But I don’t know, with that sari, how I sat. I sat in one place, glued down into that. Now, to get up, I didn’t know how to get up with that weight on my body. And then I brought it and put it properly in a box, and this and that. So, he said, “When are you wearing that next?” “Now,” I said, “please! I have kept it nicely for one wedding. I will wear it sometime.” I promised him and kept it there. Because he doesn’t understand about saris. I know he doesn’t understand about saris. So, if he doesn’t understand. Whatever he buys, I say alright. And he spent so much money on those things, you know, forty-five thousand rupees... [Hindi]

So, he doesn’t understand what is real, what is unreal, nothing. Doesn’t matter. You have to just see his heart, how he is giving.  With what love he is giving. He doesn’t understand, so what can he do? Poor man, you know.

I always buy suit lengths for him and suits for him, always, myself. Once he said: “Alright, I am going to buy this time. I said, “Better buy”. He bought such a horrible one, and he went to the office and everybody said: “Sir, this is not your taste.” [Laughter] So, he threw it away and he said, “I will never buy now. Then, you’d better go and buy for me.” See, but the trouble is, if women take interest and know what sort of colour he will like, and this and that. And also, public opinion is very important for men. What the public says.

Like once I painted my drawing room with a very nice colour, pink and black mixed, very nice. Because it is a sign of warmth. He said, “What is this colour you have put? You should have...this, that.” He started shouting. I said, “Alright, tomorrow we are having a party, after that I will change.” Next day, people came and they said, “Oh, what a colour, what a colour! How have you made this colour? How beautiful!” He started looking at Me. I said, “Should I remove it?” “No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.” [Laughter.]

Men care for public opinion very much. And you should see that you create a good public opinion in his presence, so that he will appreciate you. All these are tricks, you see. I tell you, men are very simple, but you have to understand them. Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter. Actually, if they are angry with somebody else, they will come and put it on you. It is better, because if they will do anything to others, they will beat them. You are not going to beat. If you understand a few things about men, it will work out. Of course, some are very miserable husbands, I know. And some miserable wives. For them, we have divorce allowed. In our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce for them.

So, that is the thing I wanted to tell you, that you should make a very good housewife, a very good Gruha Lakshmi. Now, why am I telling you this, that I am suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra. And all the doctors have told Me it is because in the collective, Gruha Lakshmi’s are not alright. Because they are not good housewives.

Like, I will tell you now, we have Swiss women. They are very good, I agree about that, but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are mad after cleanliness; women, women. You cannot talk to them even five minutes. If you are sitting there, they are picking up this, picking up that, picking up that, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. Very difficult. Swiss women. Now, I was in Eritrea, Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea are known to be Swiss women. Oh, doesn’t matter if the house is a little untidy, if something has fallen off. In India, no woman will do that. Now, the guests are sitting and she is with a hoover. Like another thing is, like anything breaks, say, supposing, a thermometer breaks. In India, they will say, “Very good, now there will be no temperature; the thermometer is broken.” But I have seen in the west, very surprisingly, supposing some coffee is spilled, I am a guest; immediately they will bring the hoover, bring something to clean it, in the presence of the person.

Now, if a glass breaks, finished. It is not important. It is a very subtle type of materialism, I think. That the person is sitting here, who is a guest, and why are you trying to do all these things in Her presence or in his presence? But these Western women never understand.

Another thing is, now you go to an Indian house. Their colour scheme is different. If you go to South Indians, theirs is different. Everybody has their own taste. As soon as they will enter, Western women, “What a colour scheme!” “What a thing you bought! Oh, my God, this is horrible!” Immediately they will criticize, on the face. So, another point is that you must always consider the feelings of others. Woman is there to give proper understanding of feelings of others; what they think. Or they go to an Indian house and will be smelling out their food. They will eat the same food; they will enjoy the food. But they will try to show; to show that it is something lower. This is very western, I must say. If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately they will pass a remark. Very western idea. You will not find good Indians doing that. I do not know about the modern Indians, what sort of things they are. But immediately they will say things which will hurt. This is not the way a woman should know. On the contrary, always praise! What is the harm by praising something? You are not losing your business.

By saying: “What a nice thing, what a nice sari! What nice clothes!”, what is the harm? You will enjoy your sweetness, you know, really enjoy your sweetness. It is not telling lies, not to be that honest, also necessary. Because you don’t like something, you must say, “I don’t like it!” This word must go from Sahaja Yoga. “I like this and I don’t like that!” If I say that, how many will remain in Sahaja Yoga? So, it is very important to drop this: “I like it, I don’t like it”. Who are you to like or not like? What about your Spirit? What about your heart?

So, again, the same thing comes to, that women have to have a heart; a very large heart, beautiful heart. And your Guru is a Mother. So, you have to be wonderful mothers and wonderful wives and should have very, very large heart. So that all the selfishness, even this bank will collapse, if you do that. It is existing because we have small hearts. If you have large hearts, this will collapse.

I have said it specially, because I have had many complaints about the women who are married here, some Indian women also. That is why I am telling you. Best reports are about Russian women, I must say. Very good reports about them. They are very satisfied souls, they want very little, they are not greedy. Surprising, communism has done so much good to them. It is not communism, but the extremities of communism have thrown them into that area where they don’t have any sense of possession. They don’t have.

Their government said, “Alright, you can have your flats and look after them.” They said, “We don’t want them.” Government said that, “You can have your cars.” They said, “We don’t want them. You’d better have!” Because, just to own the car is such a headache, they know. Let the government have the headache. They are not, you know, sort of people who are even conscious of possessing. Of course, now, they have had some funny people, I forget his name, who was finance minister you had. And he was in Geneva, where he learned all the tricks of the trade and he brought forth lots of reforms, so called; so, now, Leningrad and Moscow have become very expensive places, thanks to Swiss influence. So, this has happened there also, but still the people are very good, and the ladies who came from there. Even Romanian girls are very much respected, now everybody wants Romanians or Russians, or from Kiev. But this time, they didn’t come, we are sorry they are not here, I am missing them all.

Lastly, I have to tell you this is a very good book, Arun Apte has written. This is the book. You all should buy it. I don’t know, [Aside] what is the price you have put it? [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi about the book and its prize] So, those who want to have this book should apply. There are only five. Very good book; so, you will understand about Indian music.

It is said that this music has come from Omkara. And it is very sort of – sensible music. Now, I think all those musicians who sang before, who were singing western song, it was alright. But what was missing in that: melody. It is not melodious. You see, like a little bit you sing, then you sing this, then you shout, then you bring it down, then do like this. And they think that they have to sing through their heart. They have to express the feeling of their heart. Now, supposing somebody is dejected, so he sings the song of dejection. Then another one who is talking about love, he will sing a song. He may not be, but artificially they want to produce that effect. There is no need; to sing in parts, like one word, then one word, there is no melody in it, there is no flow in it. And, while, Russian songs, though they were folk songs, were very melodious. But don’t worry, Americans are invading that part also. They are having all this horrible music there. Now, the music means, it should please you. It should give you more entertainment; not to make you unhappy, not to make you sad. If you have all these feelings within you, then you should try to say like this, “Yes, there is a problem, but I will get over it.”

Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have to show the victory; the victorious nature of your lives, in your music. I am not talking about others; they go on crying, weeping and singing. But there is no melody first of all, it is just part, part, part, part. Even the orchestra, I was surprised: it all goes like this “ta ta ta ta ta” then goes “ta ta ta ta ta”.

But Indian orchestra, you will see, it is melodious. It flows like a river. So, this difference is very bad. So, I would request all the musicians who are singing. The singing doesn’t mean that you use words which nobody will understand. Words must be clear-cut and the melody must be there. Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody but words are not important. So, you enjoy the tune, and everything, whether you know the language or not, doesn’t matter. So, when you can combine melody with western music, you will see how different it will be. And this book will teach you.

This is a very good book, which you should have, and you should understand that how the music can cure you, music can give you joy, what is the basic, the essence of music. And then you can flower it out. I am sure, if Indian musicians take to western music, it will be much better than to western music as it is. I cannot understand, these people are so famous and people think they are very well earning and all that. In America, anybody can earn like that, but to make it a proper music, I think you must have the basis of Indian music. Then you can expand it as you like.

Now, please try to buy this book, to understand Indian music. There is no price yet given, but it won’t be much more than normal, so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they might bring- [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi to know when the book will be available] Or at Ganapatipule. I will try to get more of these, but this you must really read, because you will know what is the essence of music, alright?

And lastly, today is the fourth day of Navaratri, and they have given Me some of them, names which are really horrid. But they must be people who have suffered so much and they asked Mother to kill those horrible rakshasas. Now, in a way, it all will kill in its natural course. I know that. If you people take to sense, because you are the ones who can do it. If you do not try to acquire things which you don’t want, unnecessary things, if you try to reduce all these things, and take to something natural and love the Mother Earth, I am sure it will work out. The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

You know this earthquake; now, nobody is going in the church. I didn’t do anything; it is the Mother Earth. Nobody goes in the church. I didn’t do anything, I would not. I was sorry for the art pieces gone. But see now, how the nature is working out. Now, Islamic people, these Islamic people from Indonesia and all these people are suffering from the smoke. I didn’t do that. Because, when you try to do something wrong, it comes back to you. Action has a reaction. So, your faces should be sahaj, you should be sahaj, shouldn’t look like strained people. I cannot understand. You are sahaj; and be in that sahaj mood.

I am sorry I have taken so much time, but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak all these things to you, and you should try to think about it, that, “Our Mother loves us, She wants us to have a good family, She wants us to look after our children.” So, I have advised all the men, as well as the women. Better to be “hen-pecked”, there is no harm. But “hen-pecked” doesn’t mean that they are “hen-pecked”. See, they are just to please your wife; what is the harm? But it doesn’t mean that dominates you, that is not it. Like, “Come to my father’s house; I must go to my mother’s house.” All these kinds of things you should not permit.

But women should also understand, her family is more important than father, mother, even Mataji. Because I will be only happy to see a happy family.

So, thank you very much.
