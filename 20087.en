[The talk starts at 10:10 ]

Being born in Kali Yuga (the modern age) and that too in the form of a Mother is a very difficult task. For a Guru, people automatically have a sense of awe towards him. When it comes to a Mother, every human being feels that she is his rightful mother and no matter how one behaves with her, she would always forgive him. Therefore, attaining Sahaja Yoga in the form of a Mother was necessary because it could not have been achieved otherwise. It had to be in the form of a Mother — no other form had power to accomplish this work.

I am quite amazed seeing honor of a Mother in Malharpeth, in this Kaliyuga, and made Me very happy. This shows the start of Kritayug from Kaliyuga as mentioned in the almanac calendar (Panchang) and I am convinced today that it is true.

I am a woman, and also a Mother. That brings a certain tenderness in the heart. If something bad happens to you, it gives Me pain, and I get hurt.  And extensive efforts are made for your benevolence so that somehow you should get it. Because a mother does not own anything. She wants her children to be well, that they receive power, and they achieve what they deserve. She doesn’t ask for anything else. So, it is very satisfying when that work of giving (realization) is done. I do not want anything beyond that.

So many of you gathered here in Malharpeth for a Sahaja Yoga program shows how deeply devoted and virtuous you are. Moreover, you have started such a beautiful school in the name of Saint Tukaram here. I haven’t seen the headmaster yet, but I want to express my deep gratitude to him for this.

Saint Tukaram is not someone different from us - he is very much one among us. He had already made arrangements for Sahaja Yoga. He had spread it through all his poetry. I often mention him in My speeches. Not only, but these people who have come from foreign countries have learned his bhajans and sing them fluently in Marathi. If you ever hear them, you will be delighted to know that they have learned Marathi and memorized Saint Tukaram's bhajans. They are learning the meaning of those bhajans, and secret (deeper) meaning and significance.

But for us, people should pay more attention to religion, because we are truly special people. Though we do not have great material wealth, we are special people. We know that the Kundalini of the universe resides in three and a half coils in the Plateau of Saihyadri (mountain range). The three and a half sacred places (Pithas) are in our Maharashtra. Not only this, but the eight Ganeshas (Ashtavinayakas) are also in this Maharashtra. This is an extraordinary blessing from Mother Earth and this land of ours is very important, and because you were born here, you continuously receive those blessings.  You have received all the blessings by fulfilling the basics and you will continue to receive it. We will be astonished to see how we have prospered in this prosperous and light brown land (Shasya-Shamlam Bhoomi – this word was used by Ravindranath Tagore in this poetry to address Mother land).

My mother was from Nagar (real name is Ahmednagar – short form used as Nagar), and her father was a wealthy man who would travel to Mumbai and would bring back German grapes. Those grapes were only for her; the other girls at her school never got to taste them. So, when she got married and moved to Nagpur, she used to tell Me, “Dear, I feel that the people of Nagar never saw grapes or tested them. It will be so nice if they could have grapes someday!” I said, “They will get them. You should not worry.” And today, look at how much prosperity has come to you! What a remarkable transformation! Though she is no longer with us, all those spirits must be filled with joy by seeing this abundance.

However, prosperity should lead to the development of Dharma. It should strengthen our faith in God Almighty as well as in the kingdom of God Almighty. Instead, when a human becomes wealthy, he often thinks, "I did this. I did that." But what can a human being really do? If a tree falls and dies, you can make furniture out of it, but can you stop a seed (from sprouting)? You may be able to take out a seed from fruit, but can you transform a flower into a fruit? You cannot do any of these things.

Everything is a living process and happens only through the power of God Almighty. Through this living process, He made us human beings and that too spontaneously. Sa-Ha-Ja; ‘Sah’ means born with you, and this is your right to get Yoga. This is Kundalini within you and Saint Dnyaneshwar had mentioned about it. It has existed since ancient times, everything arranges spontaneously. The entire universe is created spontaneously. And in that your becoming of human is also spontaneous, becoming a superhuman is also spontaneous. It does not have any action plan, nor does it have any suffering. However, each time when humanity needs it, someone has to come and perform this (divine) work. This time, I have been entrusted with this role, and so the work is being done. Please take advantage of it in large numbers. Make yourself superhuman beings. It is all within us. The spirit resides within us as well as the Kundalini. Only when Kundalini gets connected with the spirit, one gets connected with the all-pervading power and the vibrations (cool breeze) start flowing through one’s hands. Also, a cool breeze starts flowing through our head, through the fontanelle bone area (Brahmarandhra).

Now why is it mentioned in the sixth chapter (Dnyaneshwari) that it is forbidden? Maybe some Brahmins felt that no one should know about it or something like that. I don't understand why. But people have created a lot of confusion in the name of Kundalini. Those who do not have authority should not do work on this. The authority comes from God. Such a person has to be pure and chaste. How can a person who is not pure inside himself, touch the Kundalini of any other? Because Kundalini is your most sacred mother, and she is within everyone. You cannot tarnish her. She is your most sacred pure desire; all other desires become distorted. But that pure desire, the pure desire to achieve God, is nowhere similar and that is why she is said to be dormant. Because she has not yet awakened and that awakening can happen only when the Kundalini senses that there is someone who is knowledgeable about Kundalini. Now, because of Me or other Sahaja Yogis, many people have received the self-realization. Some of them have come here. Many Sahaja Yogis have come here and started this work on a bigger scale. Now this is done in Malharpeth, then slowly by expanding in future, it should spread in all corners, and it will spread.  Because this has already been predicted thousands of years ago. You will be amazed by this prediction; that great sage Bhrigu wrote it more than 16-17 thousand years ago. Now instead of discussing exact years of prediction, it is mentioned in Nadi Granth since ancient times that this movement would begin in 1970, and Sahaja Yoga started exactly in 1970. And through that, Kundalini can be awakened spontaneously, and all can receive the Divine knowledge.

Now, it is true that Tukaram had not read anything. We have not heard about Ramdas had done any reading. They did not go to any school. Likewise, saints like Chokhamela, Sakhubai, or Namdev never studied in any school or at any university. I am not saying that education is bad, but by going to school, university one doesn’t become higher than God. By going to school, University the human believes that whatever is in books is superior to God, that is the mistake. He forgets that knowledge also comes from God Almighty. All the knowledge comes from God Almighty.

But finally, when one sees one’s spirit, knowledge starts flowing from within and even ordinary person starts talking like saints. Once experiencing the Self-Realization through Sahaja Yoga, we all become saints. The saints do not need to leave the householders, nor do they need to escape (from family life). By staying at home only, spending time with children, celebrating family life well, and by living in harmony, the kingdom of God is to be created which would be happy, joyful, and auspicious. If that does not happen, then it is not the kingdom of God. Once you enlighten the spirit which is part and parcel of the Divine, your behaviour also becomes Divine. Now about these people who came here from foreign countries; as I said, these people are much more settled than you; much more. So, these are saints. In fact, their state must be very elevated. Because if they receive realisation one day and they left everything (whatever bad) the following day. I have not seen such thing to this extent in our Maharashtra. Yet, it is very good. But still, getting realisation one day and leaving everything the following day and getting well-settled – these people must be such great saints! Means how much they must have gained (punyas) in their previous lives! It is not possible otherwise that today I gave them realisation and tomorrow they leave everything and rose above like lotuses. Everything (bad) stayed in the mud and everyone rose above. I am really amazed by them seeing this. This is special about them. Well, they don't have any religious speculation like you. They haven't been brought up same way as you in their childhood. They were given full freedom! The parents don't care (about the children). Without any system like home/family, how these people have easily assimilated Sahaja Yoga and gave it so much importance! Looking at it, I sometimes wonder that in our Maharashtra, where we hear so much about religion every day and we have so many great saints; since the childhood we listen to their poetry (Abhangavani); but when this religion (Sahaja Yoga) reaches us and awakens within us, then why don’t we settle in it with that intensity? Maybe because we know too much, familiarity breeds contempt (‘atiparichayat awadnya’ – Marathi proverb) and that is why people do not settle in it that much. But to tell the truth, this country has so many blessings of God Almighty; we are truly so lucky people that we have no idea that these people had been through such sad circumstances and so many problems...let it be.

Whatever happened, had happened. From now on, all should settle in Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is eternal, coming from ancient times, is same in today’s world and moreover it is also very modern. Because it possesses the power of all religions. That’s how it is exceptional and is very modern religion. ‘What is the relationship between Dattatreya with Ram? What is the relationship between Dattatreya with Mohammed? What these relationships to do with other gurus? Who are the gurus in the world who were Dattatreya's incarnations?’ All this is (explained) in Sahaja Yoga. Then, ‘What happened to the two children of Sita, Luv and Kush? Whose incarnations, are they? What happened to their incarnations? How they became Buddha - Mahavir later?’ All this - you will understand in Sahaja Yoga. Well, what we have been saying till now is - just the talk; but now you can prove this.

There was Muslim person coming from Iran was a doctor. He had dreadful stomach cancer. So, I asked him, “Do you believe in Dattatreya?” He said, “No, we believe only in Mohammad Saheb.”  I said, “Both were same.” He said, “We are not ready to believe in it, we only believe in Mohammad Saheb. We do not believe in anyone else.” Then I said, “If you do not believe in him, then I cannot cure you. That is why you have stomach cancer.” Still, he was not ready to believe anything, so I said, “You please go home now, I cannot do anything further.  I have given up on you.” Then, his wife acted sensibly and brought him back after eight days. thinking about him about to die and said, “Mother, now we will do whatever You advise.” I said, “Now ask, Mohammed, are you Dattatreya? Ask this question. Mohammed Saheb, are you Dattatreya? Ask this question.” Only by repeating this question, his cancer got completely cured! This way, I prove it to you. Now suppose Kundalini is awakened and gets stuck here (Mother places her hand on the heart), then which chakra is this? Now if it gets stuck there, which name should be recited? So, the name of Jagdamba. Now if you are reciting the name of Jagdamba already unnecessarily - there are many who say, “We recite this mantra, or we recite that mantra. We recite the mantra of Ram and the disease we have - is asthma.” It meant to happen! Because a person who recites Rama’s mantra, comes to us – Rama’s chakra is on the right side near the heart; we have to work on that chakra. And really, a person who has no right to recite Rama’s name and if he does that, then that (specific) chakra gets caught up. The reason is you are not yet connected to God Almighty. Suppose if you have a local minister here and I don't know him. If I go and start calling his name, the police will take an action, isn’t it? It is the same logic. That is, until you have not received  achieved your yoga spiritual practice (yogasadhana) and enter the realm of God, until you have not entered the kingdom of God Almighty, and if you keep parroting any one name, then that chakra will definitely spoil. Therefore, it should be remembered that the glory of (God’s) name is great. However, the glory of (God’s) name is such that the name should be given by the Guru to be recited. But these days, gurus are even fake to give whatever name they want! It does not have any meaning. Even the Guru himself, should be enlightened. Now people cannot recognize which Guru is enlightened? And whether he is a Guru or not? Is he a Saint or not? Even this recognition people do not have.

Day before yesterday, I went to a village named ‘Miyan ki Takali’. As we reached there, I immediately told them that there must had been great Saint. They said, “Yes, Mataji, ‘Miyan’ (saint in Urdu language) had been here. He was a great saint.” And as I sat there, he spread such light on Me that it can also be seen in the photograph. The light he spread; you can see now in that photograph. But the fact is, now you will say, that he was a Muslim saint. He was not realised soul. May he be Muslim or Hindu, they (saints) don’t have any cast as such. Because these are ascetics, they are beyond it. Similarly, how do we know if any person is realised or not? How do we know if any place is holy or not? So, you still have not got that power to see it. 

When your Kundalini is awakened and when your soul connected to your attention, then anywhere you can point your hands & can ask, whether that place is true or false (sacred or not)? If true, then the cool breeze will start flowing from inside very strongly in the hands. Cool breeze which Adi Shankaracharya had mentioned about, will start flowing with a speed in your hands. Now you would say that this task was very difficult in the past. It was! Well, but not for Me. The first thing is that I am special. And secondly, if in the past, a tree bore only a few flowers and these days it blossomed and bore lots of fruits. Then why don’t we accept that it has blossomed? Why to fight on why now and not before? Why don't we clear out (our ideas)? What is it? I am doing to best of my abilities and would request you to try it. It does not require any money, does not require any effort, but once you get realisation, you have to establish in it. Like when you sow a seed in Mother Earth, though it gets sprouted by her power, it needs care. It needs care until it grows into a big tree. Likewise, one needs to take care in Sahaj Yoga after (realisation), and it is all a collective process. You would say, “Mataji, we took a photo at home, worked hard there, worshipped (You) there.” That will not work. It is collective. That is why all should gather at centre wherever it is. Next year, do not come to Me saying, “Mataji we came to program, got realization even then we got cancer.” (If you come to the collective at the centre), then you will not get any decease, nor any trouble. In the contrary, you will help others. You will cure others who are frustrated. You will rectify worldly problems of others. You will become powerful. But first of all, you must fully absorb this power in yourself and once it is done, you have to learn how to use it. You also have to learn how to protect yourself. We call it ‘Kawach’ (protection). It means ‘Bandhan’. One should learn how to take these Bandhans before leaving the house or before going to bed at home. All these things are in Sahaja Yoga; like, I gave you a car - now you made that car run. But before that that car should have power in it, otherwise it will not run at all. So first, one should switch it on. Similarly assume that first your switch is put on. So, you have got the power. Meaning, you have got your realisation. After that, one needs to understand what is left side and right side. This means, you should understand how your brake and accelerator work. Then by practicing it, you become an expert. Once you become an expert, you can run your machine automatically. Understanding the mechanism of the machine is ‘Sahaja Yoga Vidya’ (Sahaja Yoga Knowledge) and it will not be difficult for you. Because you know immediately when something is wrong, the vibrations are lost immediately. As soon as you put it right, vibrations are back straightaway. Once it is done, the master of it, that is the spirit, it becomes free. That means, the owner of this car supervises the driver within us as well as the brakes and the accelerator. In this state, you enter into ‘Nirvikalpa’ (Doubtless awareness) state. This way, there are two steps in Sahaj Yoga. The first step is ‘Nirvicharita’ (Thoughtless awareness) and the second step is ‘Nirvikalpata’ (Doubtless awareness). It should be achieved by all. Without achieving it, the work of Sahaja Yoga will not be done in the depth. It will not reach that depth. One should have the conviction in oneself to be someone special in order to reach that depth. One must become a saint first and as it has been said that it is not meant for lousy people (‘Yerya gabalyache kaam nohe’ – a proverb in Marathi) – that is absolutely true. Experts are needed for this. The experts in Sahaja Yoga have done so much work, that is amazing! Now, we know Mr. Dhumal sahib (sir) who has given realisation to thousands of people. He has cured so many people. But the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to cure the people. People get automatically cured, once they receive their realisation. So please do not bring the sick people from all over the world. Lot of people ask Me, “Mataji, are all the disciples who come to you, are only sick people?” I said, “No. Thousands of them who come are healthy. But sometimes couple of sick people also come. And if you get realisation, then you can all get cured.” So, attention should be on the fact that for our benevolence, God Almighty has transformed Sahaja Yoga into Maha Yoga. That is why, everyone should bathe in this Ganges (by getting self-realisation).  

Realisation (Jagruti): All of you, please put your hands towards Me like this. It is late today; I often get delayed. There was one programme and I came here only after finishing that program. So, I got late but does not matter. Each work has its own timing. So, please, just put your hands like this and now close your eyes..... Just close your eyes. Nothing else to be done..... Everyone must be feeling cool breeze.... But for those, who cannot feel it (on their palms), should do bow down (Namaskar) to the Mother Earth with both the hands, then it will come. Just a salute to the Mother Earth, touching the Mother Earth by hands, she will absorb all the problems. And (you will) feel in the hands. Humbly bow down (to the Mother Earth), “oh Mother (Earth), if I have done anything wrong, please absorb it within You.” Do not move... No moving... Those who are moving, should open their eyes. These are not good signs. Those who are shaking, means have some trouble. The body should not shake nor the eyes. Nothing, everything is inside. This is yoga of inner being. Shaking meaning something wrong with your guru. Something wrong has been done. That is not right. Keep your eyes open. No farce. Keep the eyes open. People who are shaking or who are possessed, should keep their eyes open..... Nothing happens externally. Everything happens inside. Now check, check above the head as well, see if the cool breeze is coming on your head. Put your right hand above your head. Left hand towards Me. Keep (your) eyes open. Check above the fontanelle bone area. Hold (your hand) above the fontanelle bone area, hold above and move your palm around to see if the cool breeze is coming; keep your hand above. Is it coming? ... Is it? Please check by taking off your caps... No worries, you will feel cool. Now everyone is going to feel cool. Even in the (scorching heat of) Sun everyone will feel cool. Try with other hand, if the cool is coming.”
