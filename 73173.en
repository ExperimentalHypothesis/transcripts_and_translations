This center (Vishuddi) represents the greatest leap of evolution where the quadruped animal lifted the head up. So the lifting of the head in erect position, in line with your spinal cord, is a very big development in the living evolutionary process. Now, the problem could be that we cannot understand why God had to do all this. Why didn't He create a man just directly like that? Why did He use this method by which He makes him raise his own head? The answer to this comes from the life of Shri Krishna, who was the incarnation of Virata, of the Great Primordial Being. He is the only incarnation of Virata. Of course as Vishnu He was there, and He had his other nine incarnations which were dealing with the different aspects of the evolutionary process. But the perfected symbol of the Virata was Shri Krishna. That’s why He’s called as a one who is “sampuure” meaning the complete. So he completed the circle. Without completing the circle, the ruling doesn’t start. And the ruling started for man after the Vishuddi chakra was strengthened by the advent of Shri Krishna. Or we can say that when man lifted his head straight erect, that was the beginning of the modern man, of the modern person. You see, man can be called as (man), even if there have been missing links. You see? And we can say that they can also be called as human beings. Because you are calling them homo sapiens, you see? But it’s this part the demarcating part. It actually means that the lift of your head means you stand on your own. That means that you will be made capable to take things on your own. That’s a different growth in the awareness. And only because the head was lifted, the ego and superego could meet in the center. Because before man came into this position he was more superego, his brain was covered with the superego part.

Now think of someone like God who wants to create a living human being. It is rather difficult for human beings to think of something being created, which is living, because they have never done it. But when you have to do a living human being, you have to use a method by which it grows like a living thing. This is a process not known to man. That’s why he questioned the credibility of God’s behavior. But the simple principle is that every living thing has to grow. Artificially you can make a seed which looks like a real seed. Simultaneously you can make a tree which looks like a real tree. And both these things you can create in no time. But a living thing has to grow. Hence man’s question has no place. And when we say that it is the reflector which has to be perfected, and human beings are the reflectors, we always think in terms of the kind of reflector we have, that the human beings have created. So we cannot understand why God Almighty has to take so much time to improve onto the reflectors. This is the basic reason when you denounce God, then you must know that He has done a living job. And for doing the thing living, you have to give something, some sustainers of permanent value, and that has to be handled this way, only the living process. If you once understand that you cannot do anything like that, at all. You have to accept the One who has done it, must have done it the best way. But we can understand by a little analogy. For example, I want you to learn drive. Then I cannot just make you a driver, I cannot brand you as a driver when it has to be a permanent wealth, as we call it in sanskrit “sampadah”. It has going to be your own quality, a permanent quality, that has to be imbibed into you. Then you take time, even the deftness of doing something which you cannot do normally, you have to work on it. We call as a “bhaas”, you have to work on it. So to make you the driver of your mind, God had to train you. He had to teach you how to use the different parts of your being and make that knowledge as your permanent wealth.

Krishna came onto this earth about 6000 years back, as a human being, with a human body. So, as I told you, that every incarnation, whenever He comes on this earth He works out his way, or He plots out his way with the human being, from whatever level they are. And because of that, you see, you see them, not as Gods, but as human beings, and then you start wondering: why He was a God? Why didn’t you do like that? People can ask why didn’t Christ stop all that crucifixion. He came for that. It was all plotted out. And He came for that, and He had to show that limitation that you human beings can also be crucified, means that you can be resurrected. It was just his plotting, that He was crucified, that means He was killed. See, actually we can say that He was the one who was sacrificed. He was the leader, so first he was cut out, so now you go ahead. He cut his throat first, He went ahead because you were afraid to do that. So they have also plotted their way, and they have been seeing which way to do it, where to be born, how to be born, in what place, where to be placed for them, there’s nothing like riches or poverty, and these are all human ideas about one status, and things do not go into the head of an incarnation. Incarnation doesn’t understand these things and He doesn’t need it. He is, because He is there. But the thing is, they have to even plan, plan out that, so that people understand them better. You see, at the time when Christ came, He was more appreciated because he came as a poor man. If He had came as a king, He would not be accepted. So He came as a poor man because after that, egoistical human beings were to come up and they only have just the opposite of them, a very poor man. That’s very satisfying for an egoistical man, because if He was a rich man, they would never have bowed. So in this confusion, when I’m born, I had to be a middle, what do you say?, middle class.

So Krishna came to show the way to human beings, how to be a witness. Now, at his time, all the Mahakali power was achieved of destruction, I can say “samhaara”. Complete perfection of the Mahakali power is the killing of the demons. Any kind of demon you see, with that power, you can kill. He perfected on that, that He had already perfected. The second one was, that He had also perfected, the Mahasaraswati power. What is the perfection of Mahasaraswati power? You tell me know, I’ll put the question to you. You should call it the divine diplomacy. Divine diplomacy means absolute correct. Divine means absolutely correct. I mean that’s what it is Divine. And that’s what Krishna came into this world. There is a dodging in diplomacy. One example of his diplomacy, I’ll tell you: that people asked him where that it is said that you must tell the truth and something that is also appreciated, means “pryamdeyet”. I’ve told you these things before also, “pryamdeyet?” on September 8th. “Pryam” means something dear, and the truth, that cannot not be the same. If you tell someone the truth, it may not be light. Most people really don’t like the truth. That’s a factual thing.

-Can you keep it there? So, are you coming here and put your hands wherever you have a bab? Now it’s coming. Just get it direct. Was it you to her? Vishuddi? Alright you put your hand from that side, take it down, come on. Yeah, from this side. Right? Sit down here. So, now it’s moving all right with you. It’s coming into you. It’s easier.-

They asked the question whether to tell the truth or whether to tell the thing it’ll be liked and appreciated “pryam”, which will be dear. This is the example Krishna’s diplomatic answer that He said you should tell the “saptya” and “hitam” and “pryam”. He put, you see, the diplomatic word “hita” meaning the one that is good for your spirit. For example, supposing you ask Me some questions, and I tell you the truth which you don’t like. Supposing you do something wrong and you come and ask Me and I say it’s wrong. Alright? You don’t like it, but in the end, you will like it because I have told you whatever it was good for your spirit, isn’t it? For example, you can say like this, somebody comes from outside and ask Me, did you see a person like this and this? And I know he’s going to kill that person. He’s bringing the dead in his hands. Should I tell him the truth? No. According to Khrisna, we cannot, you should not, because it is “anatikar” means he has no right to take to trust. So two things you put there: that it should be for the good of the spirit, and it should be indeed right. Means I don’t need to tell the truth to all the world, don’t throw words before the right. You don’t have any right to know the truth. For example, Mister Raja, he has no right to know the truth. You see? So, if he ask the truth and if I don’t tell him, I’m not wrong, you must have the right to know the truth. And if you have a right, it should be told the truth which is good for your spirit, and ultimately it’s going to be good for you, liked by you, appreciated, and you’ll respect such a person. So this is the beauty of the Khrisna’s said that diplomacy, when it becomes divine, it is the best way of integrating people, so cleverly, so intelligently, that they start feeling the oneness, the brotherhood among themselves. As result, you can say now that we can say that Krisha has manifested as one of you and all the system nothing but that. He’s doing nothing else than diplomacy. But unless and until they get into divine diplomacy they cannot do much. Because divine diplomacy is absolute. You cannot challenge it.

His lifetime, as I told you, that his childhood, his diplomacy, and last as a ruler, you see, these three things we can divide Him. So, in the first part of his life, He showed “samhaara”. The power of “samhaara” He showed. At age of five years he killed a big serpent known as Scalia, He killed two rakshasas know as “sundoendokoes”, I mean He killed many such people, He killed “kidputana”, another lady who came to poison Him, because His own uncle was a rakshasa, and he wanted to kill Him. So He showed all these things, which are not shown in any of the incarnations of anyone like that. The child is a little boy of 5 years, you see, without any trouble. So, first half of his life, his childhood, you can see his play. Rama never displayed this attitude of being a witness, a play, the whole play going on a drama. He saw Sahaja Yoga for him was also just a play, with ordinary people as household, he played Sahaja Yoga with them. I will tell you how He played and all those things sometimes.

Now let us see how Mahakali and Mahasaraswati helped this child. It’s very interesting. His foster mother, Yeshoda, was nobody else but the incarnation of Saraswati. Once, He ate a little bit of soil, like a child and child, all children eat it. So He ate it. They said it is due to calcium deficiency sort of things they say, but no, He ate it and He had all over on the face, you see all that mud applied. So, His mother said “From where did you get all this? Why did you eat?” “You see, I eat anything! I didn't ate anything” “Open your mouth, take it out!” And He opened the mouth, She had the vision of the complete universe, Vishuddi chakra, the complete universe. She just felt at His feet, peaceful, something so beautiful it is, so beautiful, and then the Maya has to play. She used to treat him or She used to tie him down, She used to punish Him just as you would to a child. For money’s sake you should not deprive your children of what they need. And butter is so much needed for children. So He used to steal it. His stealing had a meaning, He wanted to teach these women that they should not sell the butter that they have in the market and get some money and buy something material, instead of giving to your children because they have to grow. In everything He did as a child, He tried to express one side of the “lila”, the play, of a divine child, of incarnation of the Virata itself. Can you imagine? Behaving like a little baby for your sake, doing all kinds of this pranky things and so beautifully.

Description of Khrisna has been done by one blind poets Surdaasa, and if you read it, I tell you, the mood of love for children, which is know as “vatsayala”, that mood is not here, I mean, is not in english language described. But you know that when you describe about a child, the relationship of a child, you see of (unclear), and how mist he was, and how he used to trouble the mother, and how he used to trouble other ladies of the place, and how he hid their clothes. He hid their clothes, because, you see, He wanted to kiss them and He was a child. He had no idea about the sex. He was an innocent child. So He hid their clothes just to tease them. But some people are using that as a lever for doing all kinds of non-sensical things. So He did it at that age. And in the whole play there is what you call the sweetness of “vatsayala”, of that mood. I mean, you cannot describe it what it is, but how you feel about a child. You see, that “maaduria” that He generated, that He sort put it, that was given in the awareness. See, sort of it, it gave a beautiful borderline to human endeavour at that time, it’s the “maaduria”, how to teach your children with sweetness and how to understand their pranks and how they move about. You see, the understanding of children. Rama was more concerned about his wife, his wife looked after her two children. But Khrisna gave a beautiful childhood idea, as to how a child behaves. And sure that was the mother, you know, she would get angry with him when He would come out with some sort of very prank thing, then she would just cry and take him to her heart and she would love him. Like once He stole a lot of butter that she had put (away). Bearings must understand the beauty. You see, He brought out all the beauty of children, because children don’t talk. You see, sort of He became that, and He suggested what the children feel about and how they behave and how the innocence plays the whole tricks. It’s a beautiful thing. I mean, you cannot describe it, but you can just enjoy the beauty. And the diplomacy in the childhood you see, how the children play their diplomacy.

Then He grow up when He killed “Konza”. But when He was adolescent, when He became a man, in the sense that He grew up, He and Rada both played a role, see, of the Shakti and the Virata himself. She’s the Virat’ngana. They were married by Brahmadeva himself, even on this earth. And you will be amazed how they were married, I don’t know if you know that.  You see, He was brought by his father in a basket on his head, and He crossed the river Jmna. You know his birth story I’ve told you. When He was born everyone went to sleep and his father because that was told that the child will be killed. The eight child will kill Kmsa. So this Kmsa put his sister and her husband in jail and killed all other children. Now, this was the eight child will be a man who will kill. So you see, that day what happened, everybody stepped off, everyone, and all their shackles were broken. And He carried the child in a basket in the river Ganges, in the river Jamna, which was in spate. And when he started crossing, when His feet touched the Jamna river, it went down. You see, because the basket was not so big, so his feet were coming out and He touched (the river), imagine the sweetness of the whole thing, and the Jamna went down, because He was the Virata himself. So Jamna went down and he crossed the thing and then he came and he was so tired that he put Krishna there at that point, you see, and he just went off to sleep. When he slept off, Krishna came into his own form, Radha came in, and they got married to each other. That is the time when Brahmadeva married them.

I’ve already told you one story, if I remember that, about ragas. This thing that one one, in Naruda, He (Krishna) was a great person who would go around and create problem in the (unclear) stages, he would go around and tell a story to him, and one story to him, a story to him. He was like that. And He came down, and He told all his wives that He just loves Radha, you are just for formal show, but He really loves Radha, dosen’t care for you. So they were very angry. So Krishna, as usual, you see, another diplomat, see? So He said “oh, I’ve got a terrible pain in my stomach. Just I can’t bear it. Now, there must be some treatment for that”. So all these asked “what is the treatment?” He said “the treatment is that you all have to donate the dust of your feet and I have to eat it”. It’s very nice, very clever. “You are the Virata, you are the Lord, we know you are God, and now you want to eat the dust of our feet, all spoiling all our protocol? So we become really sinners and we are useless? So we are not going to do that, we are not going to give up our punyae, punya means all our good deeds, to finish off, to do this to a person before whom you have to always keep our head low (unclear)... No we should give this dust of Her feet for you to eat. We are not going to come into your traps”, they just refused. So He told “you go to Radha and tell her” So when went told Her that “He’s got a stomach cramp, that it’s terrible, and He says that it’s only you who can treat” “So what did He suggest?” “He suggested you give the dust of your feet” Ban is the place where, you see, is all yellow color. So she took out all her yellow colour thing and She gave it to Him. And She said “I take it” So they said “aren’t you worried about your punyas? We’ll be degraded. He, you know, He’s the Lord. Whatever you may be, how can you, after all, He’s your husband. If He’s the man you cannot give Him”. I mean, I cannot ask my husband to fall at my feet sort of thing. It’s your worst to take out the dust and eat it. She said “as for the punya concern, He’s the one that knows it, I’m not bothered how”. She said “I don’t know, but you go and tell Him this, is the best of my future”. So when He took it, He said “Oh, I know She’ll do it”. She said “Before I give you this dust, I would like to know why She said like this, that He knows all my punyas and He turns all my pops, that is all since that is His job. I’m not bothered. He makes me all kind of pops and He makes me do all kinds of punyas, and I’m just dancing at stew, that’s all.” See the diplomacy, the beauty of the diplomacy. So Krishna says “all right, we just see the fragrance of that” He started taking the fragrance and beautiful lotus, He started seeing the lotus, in the heart of Krishna He saw a lotus and in that lotus was sitting Radha, and afraid they were touching all the poland (unclear) of that lotus and they were beating around. They said “when She’s in your heart how can She do any punyas? And when her feet are in your heart in your pool, and they’re rubbing there?” I mean, what is the question of punyas and all these things, it doesn't arise. And the all thing you see, now you will see the divine degrees. See the clarification, so beautiful, it’s musical, it’s poetic. So the whole divine diplomacy becomes a poetic thing. And ultimately you start seeing it again where you end up in that sweetness, maadhurya, as we call it maadhurya. Maadhurya is His form, you should say is the substance of which He’s made of. Maadhurya, it’s sweetness, but sweetness is not the word, you see, this feeling. What did you get just now within yourself? That’s the word. So sweet. You see how sweet it is? It’s what you say. It’s common to say that, all over the world, it is said. But maadhurya has got beauty, has got sweetness, the kind of a ripple in the heart; this cannot be expressed. So sweet, you see, you can say like that. I must see that part also.

You see now He would dance with all the girls who were there, gopis, but all his chitta, all his mind, was with Radha. But one day He started dancing with a girl too much, her name was Ratna, so Radha was jealous. Her jealousy, the jealousy of Radha it suggested that that the love of husband and wife is sanctified thing, and even divine incarnations would not tolerate the sharing. But the understanding was so great that in the second part of his life, when He became the King, it’s expressed the understanding. The father divided herself into two halves, and her majesty took a form of Rukmini, who was formally married to Krishna, who was the king, because She didn’t want to become queen. Now Rukmini knew she was a part of Radha, so there was no story of jealousy between Rukmini and Radha, nowhere, just surprising.
