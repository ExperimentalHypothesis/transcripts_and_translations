Eighth Day of Navaratri. Pune (India), 18 October 1988.

In the 'Mahalaxmi Strotum, why should we have all these. Because it is the Kundalini. The Mahalaxmi is the channel of the Kundalini, so there are ASHTA LAXMIS. Then Mahalaxmi and lastly the DAKSHA LAKSHMI. We have got one after another these powers within us which are expressed on the Mahalaxmi channel. Now, in the Mahalaxmi channel we have to talk about Gauri. Because Gauri is the one which is the Kundalini. So they have to talk thats why they say 'Udai Udai hey Ambe. They say in the Mahalaxmi temple. Why because, in the Mahalaxmi temple only they have to say that now you rise, we are ready, we are prepared, we have got the Mahalaxmi principle within us and now you can rise,' the Kundalini and that's why the AAVAHANA.
'Palan' means mothering or looking after the child. She is the one who looks after the whole world like a mother.
Oh Devi! you are the only support of this world, because you are there as the mother earth and supporting the universe as the mother earth. Because of Mother Earth, the universe exists, because she, the Mother Earth was created out of the all the cosmos, the whole cosmos is supported by Mother earth. Like supposing you are building a house. The house is there but it is supported by the person who lives there. Otherwise it is meaningless like a bridegroom if he's not in the marriage, what's the use of having a marriage. The mere existence of this mother earth makes the whole cosmos to exist and to have a meaning.
Mahalaxmi looks after the brain. So, everything that you know comes through your brain and that is substantiated or I should say looked after or nourished by Mahalaxmi principle.
'Paravani starts from here. (Shri Mataji explains, keeping Her Hand on Her Nabhi). Is the sound, which is silent.
Then It comes to the heart when it becomes Anahat , it's called as 'Pashyabnti because it just witnesses. The 'Vani , that energy of Vani, the energy of that sound just witnesses and is Anahata state. Then it comes here (Vishuddhi level), so it's called as 'Madhyama , still in the middle stage, up to the throat, but when it comes to the mouth, it becomes 'Vaikhari, means then it speaks, speaks. So, this is how the Paravani means the Paravani is the-say- if God has to say something - then he says it in Paravani, which you can't hear it. You don't know what God is saying - you can't hear it. So, in the same way you have got your Paravanis within you, which is of course, the human (we should say) reflection of the same Paravani, which you can't hear it. You can't hear the 'Vani in your stomach, but say you get some troubles, specially Cancer or any such diseases, you get a problem. Then it starts showing. There's a problem. That causes spandan' throbbing, is vibrations that you get, is the effect of that Paravani, which shows you that there is some trouble. That trouble you can see, then it starts throbbing. Even the Kundalini, when she starts, she doesn't make any sound, but she comes here (Sahasrara), and if there's any problem, she makes a throbbing when she goes up she makes a throbbing. As long as there is obstruction, she goes on making throbbing. It's like a - it's like a smooth water, when it runs, it doesn't make any sound, but when there is any obstruction, 'it makes a sound. So, there is a sound innate. This sound is due to percussion in the water, but there is innately sound built into the 'Vani', this sound which is silent sound, which rises from these four stages and when it comes to the mouth, then only it becomes 'Vaikhari. In the case of God, see, when He speaks, whatever He is speaking, nobody can hear it, unless and until you have reached that state of your Paravani. Unless and until you have felt your Paravani, you cannot hear it. So what happens, that, God himself has to come on this earth and has to use His Vaikhari to explain things to you. So by that you start going down and down. Then you come to Madhyama state, where you enjoy your silence. Then you come to Pashyanti, there you enjoy your witness state and then you come to Paravani, where you get the sound or you can say that you get the information, just information, but it has no sounds, no noise, nothing, just the information like a thought. Thoughts doesn't have sound, so the inspiration comes to you from Paravani. But thought has no sound. In the same way, it is a soundless thing that comes.

Q. by a Sahaja Yogi :
Is this in the void or the Nabhi or some special place?

Shri Mataji : Nabhi. This is Laxmi Tattwa the Mahalaxmi starts with that all these things work out but when you start raising higher to the agnya, then this 'Vani goes as Anahata. 'Anahata means the sound of the vibrations. I can hear. I mean somebody who puts hand on me, can also hear. All kinds of sounds you can hear then it comes up to the head and here (Sahasrara) when it reaches, then it starts making throbbing, then the Brahmrandhra is opened out, the 'Vani becomes the sound, becomes one with God. But this state, up to this state it comes up, in a human being normally it comes out from here. It is a part of it from God, but when it is given, the agnya is opened out and then when it crosses his Sahasrara, then this Vani, this sound of vibrations also comes out. Main thing is, one has to understand. That when you have reached a state of "Nirvikalpa', then the inspiration comes to you through this 'Vani' in your brain. This same 'Vani,' gives you inspiration in your brain and that inspiration gets you understand- 'like I say-you should know something between, the lines, so, because you have become a subtler sensitive person (Sookshma), so you can also start understanding the 'Sookshma and also saying, things which are 'Sookshma. Like people have become poets.

Question from Sahaja Yogi.

Shri Mataji :- When in the beginning Sadashiva and Adishakti separated, that time the "Tunkaar" which took place, that is the main thing that started. Then the Adishakti went into three forms - and with one form She started all the elements. That Tunkaar (OMKARA) which is auspiciousness, which is holiness. The Tunkaar is the one which has spread into the whole atmosphere, is the auspiciousness and the holiness. Went with everything that was created, but it was created by the right side. So though it is surrounded by it, like this house is made but it's surroundings are different. So the surrounding air supposing is the Omkara, then this house is made. So this is not that the Omkara has made this, but it surrounds and because of it's surrounding also it moulds, it moves, because the Chaitanya which is actually the Omkara, we should say, is all the time guiding, penetrating, organising, improving everything.

Sahaja Yogi : It is only the Devi that does Shri Mataji ?

Shri Mataji :- She does everything. No doubt about it. She does everything. She is the doer. She first creates Ganesha, through which auspiciousness in controlled through which holiness is controlled and through which all the universe gets surrounded by Her. Then it also enters -like supposing I touch anything it becomes holy, because the Chaitanya goes into it and it becomes holy, it becomes auspicious. So it can pass into it, it can pass into anything. But anything dead, it doesn't have Omkara. It has got electromagnetic forces and then electro magnetic goes into higher stage when the nitrogen enters into it, then it becomes 'Prana.

So at different stages it goes, then it becomes a human being. When it becomes a human being. Still is a human being till he becomes a Realised soul, then it's different story. So the evolutionary stage, every stage is Omkara- which you call Chaitanya, which goes into everything. Now this Chaitanya also is used by all these three powers. That's why it is called as Omkara- a -U- Ma, because the Goddess uses different types of powers of this Chaitanya to do other work. So the whole of 'Aum' is not used. Quite a complicated stuff.

Better not to understand. The more you try to complicate yourself like this. The more your agnya will be catching. Better you keep your agnyas down. I should say keep more to 'Bhakti' than to agnya. This will all come to you very soon.

But more over, all the time what is this-,what is that what is that. That goes on churning your agnya all the time, it's a big wheel going on. Best is stop it. Just enter into 'Bhakti' What Shankaracharya did. He first wrote 'Vivekachuramani Then he got so fed up with arguments, this, that. Then he said nothing doing. Just the 'Bhakti, of it. So, then he writes all these things. So, you get into 'Bhakti' first of all. Because this kind of enquiry, there's no end to it. I am going to publish my book- so you can read it.

Like Gregorie's book, he wrote a book, first few chapters first one was nice-how, he met me and all, that was very sweet and suddenly there is a rock of Gibraltar. All that he knew- he put it. I said, finished! Nobody is going to read this book for you. So I revised with him for a year and very difficult it was, too much of agnya, very difficult. At the end of it, I said, now everything is connected, only one thing is to be done that these two chapters have to go in the end, he just fainted. I said because these two chapters were like rock of Gibraltar. Only the people who are sort of intellectual feats would like to read it. So you better stop it and take it that side. He said, how can you do it, I'll have to change the whole book. I said, No-I ll read it from the very beginning it's better just remove it and put it there because I say so. Now nobody reads them and those who are 'agnya- walas' read them and then catch. So what I am saying-to get over your agnya, you better get to 'Bhakti.
Out of the whole thing, how much can I explain to you. Wee bit. If you ask me- Mother how do you get so many hands out of the blue ? How do you get a light there ? You people don't have that 'Chitti you don't have that computer within you. That I can explain you. So it will get complicated. Just go to Bhakti.

The killer of Bhakti is enquiry. Just see for yourself. Supposing you go in the water, do you ask the water - where do you come from ? You just swim. Otherwise you should go and ask the water-where do you come from, what is your component, this that. Or if you have to eat something do you ask how it is made? What are the derivatives ? Where it came? What is this ? What is that? Make the chemical analysis? Just eat it. Is the hunger you get, just enjoy. Mental feats are the worst thing, I tell you.
When you are doing Puja, you should never ask questions. Puja gets 'Khandit. Questioning is the big headache for me.
All the time people are questioning. What I find that they are not deep in their 'Bhakti'. When you are in the Masti (ecstasy), you don't ask anything. (Jab mast huey phir kya. bole).
Even to a Brahmin, if you ask a question he will take 'Sopan' and hit you or in the Church, you just get up and say, Sir, what do you mean by this? he is reading a sermon. He will throw whatever he gets in his hand.
* In the heart as the Buddhi.
What do you say to that? In the heart as intelligence. (resides Goddess).
Like in the well if you put, say a pitcher, than the water is inside as well as outside.

One has to realise that the man is the kinetic thing. I mean the male Avataras are the kinetic side. The potential energy is the female energy. So, even when Krishna has to kill Kansa, He had to ask Radha to help him. So, is the Shakti. Without the Shakti they have noexistence. It's like without a light the lamp has no existence. So these are main forms, but behind them are the Shaktis, which have performed all these acts.
That's how Shiva became ferocious and killed the demons, because that energy goes into him. She didn't come with any male power herself and say-if you conquer something or you do something good, you get a badge on something like that. You
might be garlanded with a medal. So she used the 'rakshasas' whom she had killed, their heads as her garland to frighten other 'rakshasas'. That I will kill you, take your heads and put them around. Just to frighten.

The attitude to the Puja should be, that you are enamoured by the Devi. That you are praising the Goddess. It's not an intellectual understanding, you see. It is, you are saying all these things just to please. So the attitude should be such, is not some sort of a intellectual treatise, that is going on but it is, you are expressing oh Goddess! Like if you love someone, then you say something, just to please that person. In the same way you are saying to Goddess something. Now these saints who have written are saying this. Just to express themselves that You are Goddess, You are like this, You are that'. Some of the letters I receive also are like that. So much full of expression of their feeling. But it's not a sort of a lecture course or anything. It is just the feeling of that attitude. So in complete 'Bhakti' it should be done.

Try to feel it in your heart, whatever is said, and that you are sitting before me. You have to say that from your heart. This is what we are saying to You, with complete humility. It is the expression like a prayer. It is a prayer. Should be a prayer and not some sort of a intellectual discussion. It is a prayer to Goddess. Unless and until you develop that attitude, you cannot go very far.

From your heart completely pouring out saying these things. Open your heart, pour it out. But every word if you take like that and start analysing it's useless. It's like flowers which you are. Because you can say it to me through your 'Vaikhari. You want to say it. But otherwise whatever you are saying is just a sort of lip service whatever you ever to want to say it, will be just a lip service. Something going on.

To enlighten your he art, you have to praise, express yourself. Should be such that you just feel like saying these things to me. You can't say it in my presence- should become one with that, you should become one with it. You are saying all these things.

Now this is a thankfulness. It's an expression that you are doing this, that. Take it as a thankfulness. It's an expression of your heart.

Even the 'Vishveshwara becomes humble. Vishveshwara is the one who is the Ishwara of the whole universe, who is Sadashiva or Shiva also becomes that.

'Be in Nirvichara during puja., dont think. Because you see, I am knowledge, alright, and I give you knowledge but your pursuit should not be after that, your pursuit should be after Bhakti. It gives you a spontaneous enjoyment and all such people I have seen have gone out of Sahaja Yoga. I am warning you. All of them have gone out those who have intellectual pursuits, all of them have gone out one by one. You should never ask me any questions. That's what I call as pure intelligence. What is the use of knowing all this. If you are thirsty, you better drink the nectar of 'bhakti'- supposing you are thirsty and I start going you a lecture, you will say "Ah baba" please give us water." If you are really thirsty. You cannot bring people by your intellectual feats, no never. Only through vibrations through Realisations. If somebody starts arguing, if he is talking through his ego, how can you talk to him. You are talking through your Atma, he is talking through his ego. Either bring him down to Atma or just stop it. It is like you are talking to a deaf person. You are saying something and he is saying something. No amount of arguments can bring them around. It's the experience only through transformation.
