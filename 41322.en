1992-1015 Public Program Brasília, Brazil

I bow to all the seekers of truth. We have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot transform it. We cannot read about it. Also, unfortunately, at this human awareness we cannot know it. We have to become the Spirit. Whatever I am going to tell you today, you need not believe Me blindfolded. But keep your mind open as a scientist has. Treat this as [a] hypothesis. And if it turns [out] to be the truth, you have to accept it as honest people. Because it is for the benevolence of your own, benevolence of the country, and benevolence of the whole world.

We are born in a very special time today. These are the times when lots of things are going to happen. And people will be in illusion – won’t understand what is right and what is wrong. But at this time only, there are many who are seeking the truth. They are not sticking on to anyone book or sticking on to one ideology, but they want to know what is beyond. They are a special category of people. William Blake*, a great poet, has said that men of God will be born in those days and they will find their Divinity, and they will make others Divine. Believe Me, you all have your Divinity intact within yourself. It cannot be tarnished. It cannot be destroyed whatever you might have done to yourself, because it is eternal in nature. Only question is of manifesting this Divinity through your ascent into a new realm of reality. You are all ready for it. There is no more fasting or suffering needed. There is no need to change your dress and your foods. It is the internal happening that is important.

You have been already told about the subtle system that works it out. When this power called Kundalini which resides in the sacrum bone awakens, She passes through six centres. The Greeks perhaps knew [that] it was a sacred bone, so they called it a sacrum. And this is awakened just like a seed is sprouted because the seed has a built-in quality to sprout. All living process is spontaneous. So, there are two things we should know when we are seeking the truth. The first one is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. The second truth is that there is an all-pervading divine Power which does all the living work. You see these beautiful plants – it’s a miracle! But we take it for granted. We have these eyes which is a camera; it’s a miracle but we take it for granted. Then look at our brain which is such a great computer, but we take it for granted. If you ask a doctor, ‘Who runs your heart?’ He will say, ‘It is the autonomous nervous system.’ Now who is this ‘auto’? So there is some power which is working out all these living miracles. So the first truth is that you are the pure Spirit, and the second one is that there is this all-pervading Power of divine Love. We cannot feel it, we cannot see it, but it exists. Now when this Power rises through these centres, it nourishes those centres. All human problems are because of these centres. And if these centres are put right, all your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual problems can be solved. It is as simple as that. Also, I would like to tell you in short [about] what happens to your awareness. When this Kundalini connects you to the mains, as this instrument [the mike] when connected to the mains, [it] has some meaning. So you too have some meaning. But it makes you stand in the present. We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the thoughts which are coming from the past or from the present. But when the Kundalini rises, She separates those thoughts and the space in between is the present. So you develop a new awareness called as thoughtless awareness. You are aware, fully aware, but there is no thought in your mind to disturb you. Thus you achieve peace within yourself. There are many people who have got prizes for peace, but I have not seen [that] they have peace within themselves. So, this peace within us is existing there, we become that peace. And such a person emits peace and neutralizes violence and anger. 

Now, the nature of the Spirit is that Spirit is the universal being. We are also universal. If you cut a part of your body, you will find [that] everyone has the same bone, the same muscle, the same artery. So we are all, inside, universal. We laugh the same way, we smile the same. The difference is just skin-deep. That is also just to create variety. Otherwise it would have been boring.  But this universal nature within us is manifested when the light of the Spirit comes into our consciousness. We transcend all the barriers of races, caste, community, religion, and nations. In short, you become part and parcel of the whole. Like the microcosm becomes the macrocosm. But it is a becoming. It is not just a lecture, or telling something, or a false certificate. But it is the becoming that is important. And you develop a balance in your life. Moreover, you become innately righteous. For example, you may be a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything, [but] you can commit any sin. But once you become the Spirit, you become above everything that is wrong. You get your sense of security and your power. This Power is flowing in you then. With that Power, you become extremely compassionate and extremely dynamic. But when the light of the Spirit comes into your attention, your attention becomes enlightened. Wherever you put your attention, it acts. The another great thing about the Spirit is that it is the source of absolute knowledge. Like you have ten children together, tie their eyes and ask them about somebody [as to] what’s wrong with this person. Now all your centers are on your hand reflected – sympathetic – [Shri Mataji shows the centrescentre on Her hand] five, six, and seven.  They all will raise one finger like this [showing the little finger of the left hand]. And [if] you ask the gentleman, ‘Have you got heart trouble?’

He will say, ‘How do you know?’

Because everyone will know the same thing. As you all can see Me sitting here, that’s how you see the same thing. So then there are no dogmas, no theories, nothing of the kind. But actually you see the reality. Then who is going to quarrel? How can there be difference of opinion? There cannot be wars then at all. But the Spirit is the ocean of joy. And after you get your Self Realization, you feel as if you are swimming in the ocean of joy. You get separated from your problems and you see them as a witness. And then you can solve them much better without getting involved into it or upset about it.

I am so very happy to be in Brazil, specially in Brasilia. No doubt, this is a very spiritual place. There are great seekers and one day this may become the greatest spiritual nucleus for the whole world. You can get your Realization in hardly ten minutes time. In this short time I cannot tell you all about it. In this hall, say, there are so many lights and only you put on the switch and you get the lights there. Because it is all built in. No use telling you about the history of electricity, how it is brought to Brasilia, it is all boring. So, the best thing is to get your Realization. I know you have some questions in your mind, and I would love to answer them. After your Self Realization, you may change your mind. So why not get your Self Realization? You can’t pay for it. It’s a living process of your evolution. Without this happening, you can never be satisfied with yourself. Anybody who asks [for] money in the name of God, is a hypocrite. Because God doesn’t understand money and banking; it is the headache of human beings. So now I would say that you all can get your Self Realization. But I cannot force [it] on you, because I respect your freedom. Those who want to have [it] can get it. And those who don’t want to have, it cannot be [forced]. Christ has said that the meek will inherit the earth. So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people. Nor it is meant for people who are stupid. It is meant for people who are truly seeking the truth. So I would request people who do not want to have their Realization should leave the hall. It would be very kind and also very civil on their part not to sit here and watch others. If you are sticking on to some sort of a ideology, then also is difficult. You must keep your mind open, then it works. So, I said it won’t take much time. I leave about half a minute for you to leave, for those who want to leave. No one wants to. All right. Such a wonderful thing that no one wants to leave. All right.

So, there are three conditions which are very simple. The first condition is that you all have to be absolutely self-confident that you all will get your Self Realization tonight. So, the second one is, follows, that you are not to condemn yourself for anything. You have to forget the past. And don’t feel guilty at all. If you have committed some mistakes, after all you are human beings, you are not gods. And this all-pervading Power is an ocean of forgiveness. So all your mistakes can be easily neutralized by that. So please don’t feel guilty. If you feel guilty, it works against the center on the left-hand side, this centre [indicating the left Vishuddhi] on the left-hand side. And you can get diseases like Angina, like Spondylitis, could be lethargic organs. And at this time if the centres are blocked, how will the Kundalini rise? So as they say in English language, is the pain in the neck you get. So better get rid of that pain in the neck. In short, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself because you are glorious, you are magnificent, you are fantastic. Because you are not connected, you do not know what you are. Like supposing, in an Indian village if I take a television and tell them that you can see lots of films, they will say, ‘What? This box? How can we see films in this?’ But once you get it connected, you can see what a fantastic thing it is. We also think about ourselves that we are just a box. But you do not know how many powers there are within you. So you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself because now you have to enter into the kingdom of God. That kingdom of God is the most efficient, is the most loving organization. The third condition is even simpler – that you have to forgive everyone. Many people say it is very difficult to forgive. Logically if you see, whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, what do you do? You don’t do anything. But when you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you and have tortured you are happy, and you are torturing yourself on their behalf. But also, the centre of optic chiasma is like that [Shri Mataji demonstrates] in the Agnaya Chakra. And this will never open unless and until you forgive. So you have to forgive otherwise this won’t open like this. As it is, you have tortured yourself all your life and now, at this very important moment, you will miss your Self Realization. So just to forgive all of them, even don’t think about them. Even thinking about them is a headache. So in your heart you should forgive all of them in general. These are the only three conditions. First is that you should be fully self-confident that you all will get your Realization. The second one is that you are not guilty at all. And the third one is we have to forgive everyone in general.

Now, we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Please sit inside otherwise... You all have to sit down. Please don’t be standing, please. There is some room here behind. Now, those who are sitting on the chairs, not on the ground, have to put both their feet on both the sides because left and right are two different powers. The left-side power is the power of desire, and the right-side one is the power of action. So, now we put our left hand on our lap very comfortably.

[Shri Mataji tells the yogis] Somebody has to come and show here.

And the right hand we use for nourishing our centres. The left hand suggests that you are desirous of Self Realization, [that] you have a strong desire to have Self Realization. And the right one is for the action. So first we put our right hand on our heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. So now, if you become the Spirit, you become in the light of the Spirit your own guide, your own master. So we take our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side which is the centre of our mastery. Then we take our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side which is the centre of pure knowledge of divine Laws. Then we raise again the right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. Then on our heart. Then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder and turn our head to our right. I’ve already told you about this centre that when you feel guilty it goes out of order. Now we take our right hand and put it across our forehead and put down our head. This is the centre to forgive everyone in general. Now we take back our right hand on the backside of our head and push back our head as far as possible. This is the centre where – without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction – you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Now the last centre. You have to stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please bend your head. Now, very important is to push back your fingers so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Please now move your scalp clockwise seven times slowly. Please put down your heads. That’s all we have to do.

We have to now close our eyes and please don’t open them till I tell you. You can take out your glasses. Now, again please put both the feet apart from each other. Put the left hand like this and the right hand on the heart. And now please close your eyes. Here resides the Spirit. So you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself. You may call Me Mother, or you may call Me Shri Mataji. Please ask three times in your heart, ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ I have already told you that if you are the Spirit, you become your own master. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We are working only on the left-hand side. Here again you have to ask a fundamental question three times, ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ Now, I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge of Divine on you. You have to ask for it. So now you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it. And here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals. Please say six times, ‘Mother, please give me pure knowledge.’ As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts rising. So now you have to enrich your higher centres with your full self-confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it. Here, with full confidence you have to say ten times, ‘Mother, I am my own master.’ I have already told you the fundamental truth about you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand on top of your heart and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, ‘Mother, I am the pure Spirit.’ This all-pervading power of divine Love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and ocean of bliss. It is the ocean of miracles. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. And all your mistakes can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner of your neckyou’re your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Please turn it to the right. Now here you have to say with full self-confidence, ‘Mother, I am not guilty at all.’ I have already told you that logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands all your life. And at this juncture if you don’t forgive, your Agnya Chakra won’t open and the Kundalini will not be able to penetrate through it. So, you have already tortured yourself all your life and now, at this great moment, you will miss your Self Realization. So now say in your heart, not how many times but from your heart, ‘Mother, I forgive everyone in general.’ Don’t think about them. Now you have to take your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to say.... Say it from your heart, not how many times, ‘O divine Power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.’ Now, the last centre very important. We have to stretch our palm fully. And now we have to put our centre of our palm on top of the fontanelle bone area. Now stretch back your fingers, that’s important. And please put down your head as far as possible. Here I again cannot cross over your freedom. Again, you have to ask Me to give you Self Realization. So now move your scalp slowly clockwise seven times saying, ‘Mother, please give me Self Realization,’ seven times.

[Shri Mataji tells a yogi] Ask him to increase the volume. [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the mike]

Please take down your hands and open your eyes please. Please put both the hands towards Me like this [Shri Mataji demonstrates]. Like this, not like this. And watch Me without thinking. Now bend your head and see with your left hand if there is a cool, warm or a hot breeze-like wave coming out of your own head. Don’t put your hand on top of your head but away from it. Some people get it too far. Now please put left hand towards Me like this and bend your head. And now see with your right hand if there is a cool, warm or a hot breeze-like wave coming out of your fontanelle bone area. If it is warm or hot, it means you have not forgiven. So please forgive. I cannot forgive for you; you have to forgive [by] yourself. Now please put right hand.... Bend your heads. And see with your left hand if there is a cool breeze-like waves, or hot or warm, coming out your fontanelle bone area. Now... Please do it. Put both the hands towards the sky and push back your head. Now ask any one of these three questions – one – three times. ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?’ or ‘Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of divine Love?’ or ‘Is it Brahma Chaitanya?’ Any one of these questions you can ask three times. Now take down your hands. Put your hands like this. You can feel your silence within yourself. Now all those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips, or hot or warm breeze on their fingertips, or the same on their hands, or out of their fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands. Please raise both [your hands].

That is Brasilia! May God bless you! I bow to you all. You all have begun your saintly life. Everywhere, all of you have got it.

May God bless you.

It is to be understood that you have gone beyond your mind. So don’t argue and don’t doubt. We have here a very good centre for you where you must learn how to make this connection perfect. And all the knowledge about your subtle system, everything, you will know. But one should know that you can only grow in collectivity. Supposing one nail is cut out of my body, it will never grow. So, you have to be humble about it and you should, all of you, master this art. You will have the powers to raise the Kundalini of others and awaken them. You can cure people. You can do so many things. And for all this, you don’t have to pay at all. You don’t have to be also obliged, because it is your own power which has worked it. It is your honest seeking which has worked out. I will definitely come next year here again for a longer period. I would love you all to grow into your wisdom like great tree of spirituality.

May God bless you all.
