Puja Talk. Paithan (India), 11 January 1987.

You must have felt the vibration of this place that tremendous and that you come here after so many years nearly when you were surprise. 
This place has a great connection with me as such because my fore-father's ruled in this place and this was the capital of Shalivahan called as Pratishatha and they made as easier as Paithan.
There were rulers for thousand of years and one who started this Shalivahan Dynasty as they called Satvahan (i.e Seven Vahanas and they represented as seven vahanas as Seven Chakras); surprising how Sahaja, after that there were a great poet as you know about him, 'Gyaneshwara' came here and he was born very close to this place. 
He was here for quite sometime, there was one fellow, who was a very supra-conscious person, who challenging there was a Chandev, so he said that, what do you have with you to show that, you got for it.
There was a male buffalo within, male buffalo, which was just walking on the road, Gyaneshwara made that buffalo to say the main mantras and Chandev try to show some tricks. Gyaneshwara with his brothers and sister rest and was sitting on a broken wall and made the wall to move with all of them in the air, then he realise Chandev that this sort of any incarnation on it. 
Apart from that another great poet called Enath who wrote lots of books song like Namadeva, describing
Sahaja Yoga, so this place had some sort of attractive focus of vibration for all these great saint to come and settle down. 

There were excavation lots of old things about this place and the sari given to goddess here that mean this place called 'Paithani' started at the time of Shalivahan and the art is still there that the only sari they
used as a real gold, as a real gold that for the goddess, so this place is still very vibrating is out of the way to the people to come down, thank god, so it's still maintain it's own vibration, and is goodness and it's purity and you all luckily people good to have come to this place and visit this place. 
As you will go round, you will see the beautiful garden next to it. The river Godavari is called Ganga the Ganges of the South, it's started from Nasik you were before and than brought here and a big dam is made for the supplier of water all over, which you can see the main on and beautiful garden near by and Eknath's temple is just behind here and so you may go and look at it also. Happily went and saw Ajanta Caves, should for you how people were dedicated here to built on that in ten centuries. 
They had not seen Buddha at all, Buddha never came from South of India, just believing in Buddha, what work they did, what sacrifices, how they built it, they had to go through very difficult times because there were no water and there were no communication nothing and they used stones you may have seen there of different
colours and different hues which are created on Mother Earth, when you break them and they strikes those ek like stones, you get beautiful semiprecious stone. 
They dissolves them in sort of indigenous solvent and used for painting and that's how the paint are today surviving, can't you see without lights, how they painted at time, what sort of eyes they may having that dedication gave them the power that they can paint it, they carried on for ten centuries this one, if Sahaja Yoga can carried for ten centuries this will be different place.

One has to learn that we have to dedicated, we must full dedicated ourselves, we are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga like in the beginning people have problems about their families, so they think that god can solve their problems and so they come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige. Sahaja Yoga now that god must solve their problems, if their problems with their relations, god must solve their problem that sort
of jobs given to god because they have imagination to join such a part.
After that god must give them money, he must provide for everything and he must look after us that for no commits at all, that no commit. 
Nobody has commitment in Sahaja Yoga, god has committed and god has to work it out and they started. Some people foolishly start using in Sahaja Yoga for other purposes like earning money or earning power, or
may be faith, or domination or anything, these are the steps which are going down not upward and then once you go down, you don't realise going upward or downward.

So in dedication one has to see, what have I dedicated for certain all the time, I have problems all the time, I say I can't do this because of that. I can't do that because of this, this is the problems, this I like to do this I like to do all the time they I, I, I and I but what have I dedicated, what I have given to Sahaja Yoga and
they can't do anything. This people not only to please but permanently went and settle in that place, in their farthest place without any machinery, without anything. They did the whole painting and whole excavation and all that entire work of such a tremendous volume that impossibility in modern times.
Nobody can recreate something like that with your machinery, with everything because they don't have dedication. So for Sahaja Yoga, we have to put ourselves onto a point, what did I do, what did I sacrifices for Sahaja Yoga nothing. If only for my own child, may be for my wife, or myself, or for my job of something, what is our commitment without commitment purity cannot come, it will go up and down like yo, yo. We are committed to Sahaja Yoga, if there are even five people who were really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga, but
problem is everybody share with each other, this kind of non-committed behaviour, that something not good. Committed means even if you have to give your life, if you should do it. Even if you have to give up everything you should do it, but all other considerations are to be taken there everything should work out, all should be enjoy all the time, you must get your jobs, you must get your wife, you must get everything, children properly done, everything should be done by Sahaja Yoga and when this commitment will start, I am sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like anything. Even falsehood when people are committed like you see all the religion, every religion they did that and how much it has spread, of course Sahaja Yoga is bless, blissful, bless you all the time, it gives you very long row to hang you sometimes, one must know the blessing that kind also.

So one has to be very very alert that god has chosen us for a very special work and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.
All those who were wise will take this to understand that life is only work this otherwise is useless, is good for nothing it has no meaning and this has to come first from the leaders and then from others complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga. It doesn't mean that you to give up anything, for my thing you don't have to do it but for your own sake, for your own betterment, you have to do it. I hope next time when you come to India you will be coming better prepared for commitments.
Is not only money, is not only your talking about it saying about it writing about it, but it is through your own being it should have it, you all should have become source of energy that I want to emit all over the world that light which is going to enlightened, no doubt the artificially going to work it out, but complete genuineness within it, look at Sikhs they had nobody, they didn't have mother to alter. 
Gyaneshwara's life if you be, you will be shock, he didn't have even shoes to walk, he was chitted shows badly because of his father was a sanyasi and was married so they said that these children of sanyasi, they had no food to eat and they have to walk for miles together barefoot, they had no blessing of mother on them, this spit of that they kept to Sahaja Yoga, they kept their blessing one big modern because of their Chit that state, know all this for your good for your benevolence that you get all your blessings, that doesn't mean that you should meet, that you should not progress, one has to progress higher and higher, one has to decide the commitment. I committed to Sahaja Yoga that is what you have to be committed.

MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
