“Commitment and dedication”. Puja Talk, Paithan, Maharashtra, (India), 11 January 1987.

You must have felt
the vibrations of this place: they are tremendous. And that we should come here after so many years
is really very much surprising.

This place has a
great connection with me, as such, because my forefathers ruled in this place. And this was the capital of Shalivahanas. It’s called as ‘Pratishathan’ but then they made as easier as ‘Paithan’. There were rulers here for thousands of years and they are the ones who started this
Shalivahan dynasty. Actually they called
themselves as ‘Satvahan’ [which]
means ‘seven vahanas’. They represented the seven vahanas of the seven chakras.
It’s surprising how Sahaj. After
that there was a great poet as you
know about him - Gyaneshwara. He came
here and he was born very close to this place. He was here for quite some time.
And there was one fellow, who was a
very supra-conscious person, who challenged
him. His name was Changdev. So
he said that, “What do you have with
you to show that you have got God with you?”

And there was a male buffalo with
him which was just walking on the road, and Gyaneshwara made that buffalo say Veda mantras. And this Changdev tried to show some tricks. And
Gyaneshwara, with his brothers and sister, were
sitting on a broken wall and made the wall to move with all of them in the air.
And then he realised, Changdev, that
this sort of any incarnation on this
Earth. 

Apart from that
another great poet called Eknath who
wrote lots of folk songs, like
Namadeva, describing Sahaj Yoga. 

So this place had
some sort of attractive focus of vibrations
for all these great saint to come and settle down here. There were excavated
lots of old things about this place and the sari given to Goddess here, [which] is made in this place, is
called as paithani. It started at the time of Shalivahana and that art
is still there. That’s the only sari in which they use real gold as the thread, real gold; just for the goddess. 

So this place is
still very vibrating. It’s out of the way to the people to come down, thank God,
so it’s still maintained its own vibrations, and His
goodness and His purity. And you all
lucky people in this group to have
come to this place and to have visited
this one.

As you will go
round, you will see there’s a beautiful
garden next to it. The River
Godavari is called The Ganga, The
Ganges of the South. It starts from
Nasik where you were before and then [is] brought here. And a big dam
is made for the supply of water all
over, which you can see on your way. And
there’s a beautiful garden nearby. And
Eknath’s temple is just behind here, so we
can all go and have a look at it
also. 

I’m happy you went and saw Ajanta Caves: [this] should for you how people were dedicated,
to build all that in ten centuries. They
had not seen Buddha at all, Buddha never came from South of India. Just
believing in Buddha, what work they did! What sacrifices! How they built it! They
had to go through very difficult times because there were no water there was no communication, nothing. And they
used the stones - you must have seen there - of different colours
and different hues, which are created by
Mother Earth. And when you break
them, inside those egg-like stones, you get beautiful semi-precious
stones.

They dissolved them in some sort of an
indigenous solvent and used for painting and that’s how the paintings are today surviving. You can’t see [the paintings] without lights, so how they must have painted
it at time, what sort of eyes they must be having! Their dedication gave them this
power that they could build it. And they carried on for ten
centuries this work! If Sahaj Yoga
can carried for ten centuries this will be different place.

So, one has to learn that we have to dedicate. We must full
dedicate ourselves. We are not here to gain
everything out of Sahaj Yoga. Like, in the beginning people have problems about
their families so they think that God should
solve the problem because they have come to Sahaj Yoga to oblige Sahaj Yoga now, so God must solve their problems. Now, [if] they have problems with their jobs,
God must solve their problem! If they have  problems
with their relations, Go must solve the problem. That’s the job given to God
because they have very graciously joined Sahaj Yoga. Then, after that God must give them money, He must provide them for
everything and He must look after them, for
no commitment at all, there’s no commitment, nobody has any commitment
in Sahaj Yoga. But God is committed and God has to work it out.
Then they start, some people
foolishly start using in Sahaj Yoga, for other purposes, like earning money or
earning power, or name or fame or
domination or anything. These are the steps which are going down, not upwards. And then, once you go down, you
don’t realise whether you are going
upward or downward.

So in dedication
one has to see, “What have I dedicated for Sahaj
Yoga? All the time, I have problems. All the time I say, ‘I can’t do this
because of that. I can’t do that because of this, this is the problems, this I would like to do this I would like to do.’ All the time there’s an I, I, I and I. But what have
I dedicated? What time have given to
Sahaj Yoga? How much money have I given
to Sahaj Yoga? Nothing at all!” 

People don’t even take leave (holiday) for Sahaj Yoga. They can’t do anything for
[Sahaj Yoga]. These people not
only took leave but permanently went and settled in that place, in their farfetched place; without any machinery,
without anything. They did that
whole painting and the whole
excavation and all that entire work
of such a tremendous volume that is
impossible in these modern times. Nobody can recreate something like that, with
your machinery, with everything because people
don’t have dedication. 

So for Sahaj Yoga
we have to put ourselves onto a point, “What did I do? What did I sacrifice for Sahaj Yoga? Nothing! It’s only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself, or for my job, or for something.” 

What is our
commitment? And without commitment
purity cannot come in. You’ll go up
and down like a yoyo. 

We are committed
to Sahaj Yoga. If there are even five people who were really, fully
committed to Sahaj Yoga it can be built
up that way.

But the problem is everybody shares
with each other, this kind of non-committal
behaviour. And that’s something not
good. 

Committed means that even if we have to give our life
we should do it; even if we have to give up everything we should do
it. But all other considerations are to be taken there everything should work
out, it all should be joy all the time, you must get your
jobs, you must get your wives, you
must get everything, children, properly done. Everything to be done by Sahaj Yoga.  And
when this commitment will start, I’m
sure Sahaj Yoga will spread like anything. 

Even falsehood
when people are committed...like you see all other
religions, every religion they did
that, and how much it has spread. 

Of course Sahaj
Yoga is blessings, is blissful, it blesses you all the time. It gives
you a very long rope to hang you also
sometimes. One must know that it’s a
blessing of that kind also. So one
has to be very, very alert that God has chosen us for such a special work and we have to be fully committed to Sahaj Yoga. All those who are wise will take this and
understand that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it’s useless, it’s good for nothing, it has no meaning. 

And this has to
come first from the leaders and then from others: complete commitment to Sahaj Yoga. It doesn’t mean thatyou have to give up anything. For my thing you don’t have to do anything, but for your own sake, for
your own betterment, you have to do it. 

I hope next time when you come to India you will be coming better prepared for commitments.

It’s not only money, it’s
not only your talking about, your
saying about it, writing about it, but it is through your own being it should happen. You all should become the
source of energy that I want to emit all over the world; that light which is
going to enlighten. No doubt the artificiality is going to work it out,
but complete genuineness within you. 

Look
at these saints! They had nobody,
they didn’t have Mother to help them. Gyaneshwara’s
life if you read, you will be shocked! He didn’t have even shoes to
walk. He was treated so badly
because his father was a sanyasi and was married so they said that, “These are the children of a
sanyasi.” They had no food to eat, and they have to walk for miles together
barefoot. They had no blessings of The Mother on them. Despite that they kept to Sahaj Yoga,
they kept their blessing of being one
with God. Because they achieved that
state. 

Now all this for your good for your benevolence that you get all the blessings. But that doesn’t mean that you should stagnate, that you should not progress. One has to progress higher
and higher. One has to decide the commitment. I am committed to Sahaj Yoga that is what you have to be, committed.

May God bless you all!
