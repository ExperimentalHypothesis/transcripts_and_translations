Sacrifice, Freedom, Ascent. Bordi (India), 6 February 1985.

I am immensely joyous to see you all here. I do not know what to say from my side. The words get lost. They have no meaning. So many of you are aspiring to ascend to that state where you would have complete joy, bliss and peace. This is what i could give you. And a mother is only happy when she can give whatever she has, to her children. Her unhappiness, all her restlessness, everything, is just to achieve that end, to gift all that she has..

I do not know how much to thank you people to go through all this to get to that treasure that you have within yourself. “sahaja” is the only word i could think when i started to manifest sahastrara opening. That’s easily understood by everyone so far. But you have realised that it is today a different style of yoga where first enlightenment is given, and then you are allowed to look after yourself. It was never done before- its just a venture of your mother which has worked out.

Otherwise, in olden times, of course, the concern of divine was to get people enlightened. And they did not know how to work it out. No incarnation ever tried to work it out in this fashion. But whenever they tried, they tried to have a very severe hardship for the seekers. Very severe hardships.

I wonder how many of you have read the treatise of Buddha, when he used to travel with thousand of his disciples- not giving realization. They were not realised souls, without feeling any joy around. With two clothes. Living in the jungles,- just two clothes. And the area where he visited, which i have seen myself, is terribly cold; chilly, absolutely chilly. And the clothes were not clothes actually, it was cloth covering their body, sleeping on the open ground, in a very severe winter, or may be in summer. Without any shoes they were asked to walk, for miles together, miles together!
If you go and see where buddha has walked and trodden, you will be surprised. Buddha was also young, he used to walk, but his disciples used to walk much more, because he would go and station at one place, he would send his disciples, - there was no time to advertise, or to announce anything. So that he used to stay in one place, and the disciples used to go round the villages, ask for bhiksha, - meaning the alms, - to gather some food from the villages; cook one time, give part of it to buddha, and rest of that they used to eat.
They would go, work out, get people from all the villages, whatever was possible, and bring them to buddha for sermon. Such sacrifices!! They’ve lived in huts, caves, in terrible darkness, meditating. But they never got realisation. Very few got their realisation.
There were people, who were sons of great kings, and princes, dukes, what you call, duchess as you call- all very-very rich people. Woman of very rich families followed him. And they walked for miles together with him in the thorny routes- because they felt that buddha’s work was of such universal importance; that they are the part and parcel of such a tremendous task; that they should be taking part in such a great work for humanity.

This is not only in india, but even viditama who started the zen system in japan. In china, i was surprised, the amount of sacrifices the saints have made; the way they lived! I mean if you see the way they were living in the conditions. You cannot imagine! And they ended up their lives like that. Working it out, without proper guidance, because buddha had died, there was no way out. They had to find their own ways. Then they found mahayana and shvetayana- all kind of things.

Even if you see other seekers in other religions,- like at the time of christ. Where did they live? And after the death of christ it was even worse, because they were persecuted, they were killed, they were tortured, crucified! It happened with moses also. His disciples were hounded, so they had to all run towards india. Imagine the distances! From that area to kashmir, how they must have walked! How they must have lived, how they must have carried. And in thousands, they came, to india.
Because they realised that they are doing a tremendous task. Something so great that they are supporting.

In this country ( india) we had a struggle for freedom. I was part and parcel of that. My parents were part and parcel of that. They were rich people; quite rich i should say, from every standard. You will be amazed, my father burnt all his suits; they were stitched in england. My mother burnt all her sarees. They used to spin their own clothes and wear them.
My father sacrificed everything, every pie that he had, for the freedom struggle. He left nothing for us, not a single…. I should say, of course our family being rich we had silver and gold and all that. But as far as all the cash money was concerned, was spent. And all this silver and gold also, thanks to english, that they took away from us, and they returned us when they went back. This is how we had some silver and gold left in our family.
Everything, all that is material, was snatched away. And i know, we lived in beautiful houses, and then we shifted to huts, and lived there. Sacrifices to the maximum. And we were happy about it. Very proud!
We had only two changes. We used to wash our clothes, live like very poor people, sleeping on this kind of thing (thin, rough floor mats) for my life, i remember that i never used to take a pillow. I never used chappals (slippers) for ages. I had only one sweater (pullover) made of this kind of material (very rough woollen) till i passed out and went to medical college, i had that sweater with me. I had only one coat, throughout my education. When i was in lahore (medical college), which was terribly cold and sometimes can be like london, it was worn out and finished.
But we never grudged, and never grumbled, and never said that our father should have looked after us and done something, why did he just sacrifice everything for the country, never, never, never.
But even today, when you see us, anywhere, they know we are children of such a great man. They have tremendous respect for us.

That quality was created, i should say, by mahatma gandhi. He made everybody so transformed into a new personality of tremendous sacrifice. Tremendous! You cannot imagine how people lived! All the money we had, everything, that we had, all conveniences, conveyance, all houses, everything was given up, not only by my father but so many of them. Otherwise we could have not got our freedom, this country has sacrificed so much.

Now, after that, we are here to get our freedom, to get the freedom of our spirit. To make our spirit free from greed, lust, from our anger, from our conditionings, from our terrible ego, from the body being enslaved by comforts.
I must say gandhiji had a special charm. I do not know how he managed. He was like
“touch of midas”, touched anybody, he became transformed, you see. And he was an extremely strict man, very kind to me, the children. But he was an extremely strict man. He would not tolerate any nonsense at all!

Throughout, if you study in the way all these people were brought up, not only for freedom or independence, but even before that, for spiritual life, anywhere, there is one thing very common, is sacrifice. And the consciousness that you are doing something great. Consciousness that you are part and parcel of the whole. Such a big thing, such a big work, it’s a noble cause!!
And then there was one thing very common. Very common among all of them: that the noble cause made them sacrifice in such a sahaj manner. Much more than the sahaj yogi sometimes, who has got so much in sahaj yoga. They have got their joy, they have got their spirit.
I have seen with my own eyes, such people in this country, whom you may call legendary but i have seen it. Thousand of people were killed and butchered! Children died! Nobody shed tears. Nobody shed tears, but to feel that you are for such a noble cause itself gives you that joy! And that sense of involvement!
And moreover, what i know about mahatma gandhi and other people, what i have seen, how they were. Everybody was not allowed to come in. And anybody who did slightest thing less than- whether he was king’s son or he was anybody’s daughter or anything, any little thing spoilt, ‘anything’, he was chucked out. I have stayed in gandhi’s ashram, so i know what it is, and that’s why you know i can go through rigorous life. It is his training.
All the children above twelve years had to clean whole of that ashram area, which is i think in 50 acres of land, - every morning. They had to clean their toilets. Also the toilets of their guests, i have done it. And they were allowed only two dresses. And nothing could be kept, even you cannot see ‘even one’ paper anywhere, any litter anywhere. So clean, spick and span. And the living places were so neat and tidy. It was all done with cow-dung- completely with cow-dung. Everybody had to take a bath, early in the morning at 4 o’ clock, with cold water. Whether it was jawaharlal nehru (first prime minister of india), abul kalam azad, my father, of any age group, or a child. And 5 o’clock, mahatma gandhi was there for his lecture.

(please don’t raise your hands or raise your kundalinis, please be seated. This is not the way. Try to understand what i am talking)

And then, early in the morning at 4 o’clock, you will be surprised, getting up- for me it was alright,- and then to walk in that 50 acres of land to centre of that hall- which was nothing but just an open space surrounded by some sort of huts where gandhiji was living. To walk all the way after bath, after getting ready, all that. And snakes used to crawl along. Nobody was bitten, of course. I think the snakes understood that people were busy with great job of freeing this great country!
And we would sit, just like this and the snakes would be crawling. No lights were allowed. No lights of any kind. We only used sunlight. And when gandhiji would come- i mean sunlight was not there in the morning, at all- some lantern were brought to put there. And we would see the snakes crawling up.

But i never heard anybody complaining, but like a war, drove with such passion, everybody, competing as to, “what i can do, how i can be alright” nobody even thought of comfort! Of course they were all about say 50 years, upto 50 years of age or something like that, may be. In the ashram mostly people were upto 50 years of age, that time.
And i have seen by my own eyes the people who had huge cars in the house and things like that, they sold off, they threw it away. They used to come by train to wardha station and walk down. Gandhiji would not see anybody coming even in tonga (horse-cart). And they listened to him and obeyed him.

I have seen many missionaries, though they are not upto point, nothing very noble, but the way that’s how they take people to task and people work it out for them. I have seen them. In india we have missionaries, and they are the people who have come from abroad, they just ‘ absolutely obediently’ listen to the church, and did whatever they said.

Now today we are doing, as you know, the greatest of greatest work!!
Because freedom is of course necessary, political freedom to talk about the god. We could not even make small needle at that time, we were not allowed, by government (british) so much oppressed. So we had to get out of the shackles of slavery. No doubt.

But now i find we have another kind of slavery. A slavery of selfishness, self oriented! “ this is my comfort. I must have this, it should be enjoyable, i am enjoying, i am this, i am that”. You should enjoy, otherwise it is not something great. I mean the whole thing should provide you some sort of a feeling, instead of you providing the feeling. Because people, i think, do not know what they are doing. What sort of work they are doing. They do not want to come to that level of that height, to see, “ what are you upto”? You are trying to save the whole world!!

This is one of the reason sahaj yoga moves so slowly, because they see the people who worry, who are worried about their comforts, this, that, and also themselves are so lousy. There is no smartness about them. No feeling of that ‘greatness’ that they have to do. You have to be smart. If you know you are on war, how you behave??
I am sure the mediocrity is much less now. Better people. I am sure we will get better people now, much better people.

They worry about little things of their family, this, that. They worry about their own problems, and their jobs, and this and that. I mean nobody could do like this to gandhiji! I tell you, he would have slapped! Take it from me.
It is as if to come to sahaj yoga means “ solve your problems”; that’s all, though you are- they are solved no doubt, you are helped, god helps you so much. But how much are you doing about it?

Of course we have some great sahaj yogis, i do not deny the fact, we ‘have’, some. Much more than i had, ever. And that is why i am very joyous about it. But the dedication we have, - we count every penny that we spend. How much we have got out of that penny, what did we do about it. This is not the way.
Buddha never spent a single penny of his own. He got money from all his disciples. Built all these big things and all that. He never had even public help from any body else.

So rise now… you must rise above your petty small mind. Rise upto the point where you should know “you are going to save the whole humanity” if you cannot feel that, it is better to leave sahaj yoga. Sahaj yoga is not meant for the people who are lousy. In marathi the word is (gabale) Tukaram has said, “yerya gabalyache kaama nohe”. It is not the work of the lousy!!

Shivaji himself, when he fought his war, he caught hold of people, the sardaras and the dukes of that time they were. They gave up everything they had, they gave up their lives, everything! Their children they sacrificed, they sacrificed whatever they had, shivaji had no money to pay them. You must have heard lots of stories about shivaji.

While if you see how these sahaj yogis are in this world, kshema (well being) comes before yoga (union). Its like that. Its your mother’s love. I want my children to be comfortable. They are newly born babies. Alright, they need comfort, they are to be looked after.

But i cannot blackmail the divine because the children are small. Can i? I am here to do the job of god almighty. And when you are my children, alright, his grace will work, he will look after you. He will make you grow.
But grow now. Grow…. You have to grow. Get out of this small nonsense that you are.
See your personality, how you live? Where is your attention? What do you think? Are you thinking about sahaj yoga? That is the most important thing for which you are chosen.

I felt sometimes, as i was feeling all the time, that you might be uncomfortable in many places. But i myself have seen the way you people have been in those places, most carelessly – the western sahaj yogis, i was surprised! That way indians are better in this respect. And some of the indian sahaj yogis have been misbehaving in a very funny manner. It shocked me! The way they have been behaving, shouting at people, creating problems. Some people come to see me, they talk to them in such a rude manner that they run away. You can talk to them sweetly. You have to be nice to them. Not to shout at people. Alright, i cannot meet everyone at every time, at every convenience, alright. But that does not mean that you have right to shout at others. This is so ‘petty’ so ‘low’ that i do not know how far i have to come down.
When you rise above all these petty things, you will develop that divine discretion. That divine discretion is the blessing of god. All other blessing you think is blessings is no blessing at all. Unless and until you can grow, what is the blessing? Like a tree which has known such a blessing that, “ i have got rain” but out of that rain if you cannot grow, what is the use of having that rain on you?

You have to be compassionate, beautiful, sensible people, who are the ‘highest’ things on this earth! Take out your attention from all nonsense that you have been busy with. That is how you get possessed. That is how you get conditioned……small, small things, you see….

In india we have another problem. We cannot tolerate another person. If any person is doing good for sahaj yoga, immediately a group will be built up. It is very common with indians also. A group is built up to put him down.
This was done when gandhiji was there. I do not know how it happens. It only happens with poor leadership, i think. I don’t have that leadership. At the time of gandhiji, he used to ‘blast’ people out,’ completely’!!

Cutting each other’s throats, saying things behind the back, forming groups. Anybody who works something nice, and i try to help that person to express himself, immediately a group comes up to press him.

And there are some hopelessly peripheral, useless sahaj yogis in the west and in the east, who try to make a mess of things. They think, they are big gurus, big people. ‘very small’ people chicken hearted, i should say. And they think they are very big, great people, because they can take good photographs, may be, or that they can wear a dress in a particular manner, or something like that stupid stuff as they are. And they try to dominate others. Such people will be thrown out. Absolutely. No use of having useless people in a machine like this.
Today is the beginning of a new era, of a new era of people of very high qualities, whose spirit has been enlightened. Let us all think about it!

Now you have to rule yourself. And you have to rule others through love, compassion and discretion!!

“today that’s the big time that i declare that it is the universal religion, the nirmala religion which is formed out of my teachings of love”

But it does not mean by any chance that you remain dwarfs. I am not going to spoil you, by keeping you dwarf people. So, try to rise. Do not dominate others. Respect. Respect each other. You are out for a very big work of virata. How much you know about divine, nobody has known so far! But fix up yourself.

I have known a very great saint called gagangadh maharaj who has fallen down completely. If a person like him can fall down, you also can fall down, if you do not understand what is your worth, what is your value and what is your position you are given.

So we have to today, with all our love for our mother, have to decide in our heart that we are going to have large heartedness, of sacrifices!
What have we sacrificed so far? Just think of it… have we? Did we sacrifice anything?
Please try to understand that i have to use you, the great souls, to save the humanity. You must grow, you have to grow.

On money points also people are wretched. They make money. They save money. In america i was surprised the way people cheated me of money! Thousands! In india also there is, it is very common practice.

Then if you have career mindedness, and you are very ambitious, “ how my job will remain, this, that, “ you better get out of sahaj yoga! It is not going to help us at all!

Thirdly there are people who believe that, “: this is my wife, this is my beloved, this is this,” and all that nonsense. Why are you here? For what??- or “ my children, my household, my mother, my father,” all sorts of wretched people around. If you cannot rise above that, you cannot help me, i am sorry. You cannot help.

You have to be very-very strong people, you have to be the people of very great valour and great idealism and noble ideas.

Some are like petty shopkeepers, who follow the platoons to sell some things around. In marathi it is called bazar bhunge!

So now you meditate on this point that here we are to establish the universal religion of ascent. It is a tremendous task! If i could do it alone, i would have done it. But i cannot, it is only through you i have to do it. And you have a heritage. You come from a very great birth, where you have this heritage. With ‘thst’ heritage of i cannot manage you, i think i better give up your leadership. I cannot do it.

When we were fighting for our freedom, all of us were removed from our schools, and the missionaries believe that christ was born in england, so they would not allow us to study in those schools. So we were all removed from those schools. We had no education for some time. I could not pass my inter-science for two years! I could not appear because they rusticated us from colleges and schools. The government rusticated us.
But we were such proud children, very proud. I was of course very much thick in it. I was never frightened. I was just an eighteen years old girl. And i remember one day some people came and told us that your father is transferred from this jail to another jail. They had such pride for all of us, all the people! So they had brought cars to take us down. And they were so many there.
And mother naturally was worried because i was a young girl. The police used to torture me, used to give me shocks, and make my life very miserable, beat me, and all that. So she was crying and she told an old gentleman who was there that, “ i am worried about my daughter, i do not want her to be tortured anymore” so i went and smiled at him, so he said, “ no, just don’t. Stop it, now you just don’t do it, its not proper”.

My father, you see, took me aside, he said, “ don’t listen to this old johnny, he is now about to die, forget him. I would like all my children to be sacrificed on the altar of freedom. If you are doing it. I am a proud father. And i will tell your mother to behave herself. I am so proud of you!!”
Such atmosphere i have passed through. I had to give up my college. I was absconding for eight months, the police was after my life. I know what we have gone through. We were very young people, eighteen years, you can imagine!

And now when you have got the freedom of your spirit, you must seek the comfort of your spirit.
There are some people who are complainers, and this, and that, nonsense. They should not have come, or those who are indians, they should get out of sahaj yoga and leave us alone.

But, those who know they have come here, not to enjoy themselves only, but to make the whole world enjoy what you have got. To give it to them. And for that one has to sacrifice, one has to bear the pangs!

How much i bear your pangs when you are caught up, when you have troubles, when this and that. I have got blisters some times, from you, everything, but i don’t mind. Because it is my life, my mission, my existence, my everything- is for the purpose of emancipation of humanity. ‘even’ the last drop of my blood is for that. My satisfactions are very different.
Please remember, you are born out of a very brave mother. Please try to rise. Be proud that you are doing such tremendous task. Have that feeling of great valour. Then only, then only we can achieve results!

You have seen so many wars, you have seen so many war pictures, you have seen how people have fought, how they have sacrificed themselves. And let us see what are ‘we’ doing in this war!

Just make your body your slave. Get out of the slavery of your body, of your conditionings, and your nonsensical ‘ego’.

I am sure as mother i am not so bad. But as a father i think i lack some things, please try to come up. So that i should feel that i did not lack in my fatherly attitude towards you- that awe, that understanding of a father’s expectations.

This i am not saying to you because this is some present situation, because of you particularly, or for anything- which is very sort of present day problem. None of these things.

But is my announcement of this new dimension into which we have to rise. And as in the war, we have to declare, “ now forward on.” In the same way this is a declaration. In no way to degrade you, in no way to insult you, or to say anything about anyone of you. But to just infuse that inspiration, which led thousands and thousands and millions and billions of people to sacrifice for the greater cause!!
So now, have respect for yourself, “ raise your heads! ” you are the ones who are going to fight. You are the ones who are responsible, prepare yourself! Prepare your body, prepare your mind, be discreet!!
This is my….. Would not say request again…. This is my order!

May god bless you!!

Let us all meditate now. There is no need for tying up your kundalinis, there is no need to give yourself bandhans. There is no need at all to do anything. If you come up to that stage just now. There is no need to raise your hands and tie up your kundalini, not necessary. Nothing is to be done. Your kundalinis are already tied up. Assume! Assume that situation, that’s all, that’s “what you are”! the Viras [brave] And not the stupid.
May god bless you all! May god bless you! Respect yourself. Respect!

May god bless you!

There is nothing, nothing more important to me than to see you rise to that level of understanding of your own values, and worth, and discretion. You have to become sweet, nice people. ‘but’ very, very powerful! That you can control yourself, your tongues and your things. The control, complete control of your self.

May god bless you again
Please meditate…close your eyes close your eyes.
Just close your eyes, put your both hands towards me.
Put your attention onto sahasrara, just your attention onto sahasrara.
You are in my sahasrara all of you just now. Put your attention to your sahasrara.
There’s no thoughts, nothing, just put your attention to you, and just rise up to that point. There’s no drama about it. There’s nothing artificial, it’s actualization. All weaknesses are to be left behind. Let’s be strong people of strong values –with dignity and sobriety.

Silence, absolute inner silence. And one need not talk too much. Too much to jabber, to talk, frivolously, it’s not your way. Feel it in your heart, your own dignity, your own glory, the serenity of behaviour.
You are all saints, but saints of very high quality, of very high quality not ordinary type.
Put your attention to sahasrara [ shri mataji says the same in hindi]
Any thought coming say : "not this, not this, not this".
May god bless you.
