Whether we believe in the Supreme Spirit (Paramatma) or not, It doesn't depend on our belief whether the Supreme Spirit exists or not.

And even if we keep telling you that the Supreme Spirit (Paramatma) exists, और आप उसका विश्वास भी करलें, And you believe in it," It still won't make any difference. Even if you disbelieve, you will do so in ignorance," And even when you believe, you are still in ignorance. Believing in it without experiencing it is also ignorance." And disbelieving in it is also a sign of ignorance. Therefore... You should approach it with an open mind, You should approach it with an open mind, Like a scientist, A researcher, Who knows nothing, Who doesn't have any preconceived ideas, Who hasn't already made up their mind, In the same way, you should perceive it. Regarding this topic... Who knows how many books have been written by humans, It’s like an endless ocean, And out of that, who knows how many people have written only falsehoods; All falsehood has been written; But what is the difference between truth and falsehood? The mark of truth is that it reveals itself in every situation, And it never proves to be false under any test; that is what truth is. Whatever we discuss with you, Or whatever we tell you, Listening to it like a scientist means, That we are presenting a hypothesis, an idea before you, And later we can prove that idea to you; And those who are sitting here, who have seen our work, They know that this can be proven. But keeping an open mind, Is very important, Because many of you have read a lot on this subject; It doesn't take much to write, If you have a little money or Someone is ready to help you a bit. So, you can keep writing book after book, And there's no need to seek the truth.

In matters of religion, who is there to ask why you wrote something? In religion, anyone can say whatever they want, Even people like Hitler spoke about religion, and so did people like Napoleon, Because In the matters of religion, You can even sell unrighteousness in the name of religion, Where is the law that catches them yet? Whosoever will, sell unrighteousness in the name of religion, And there's no law yet to put them in jail for it. But if you are a worshiper of truth... And if you want to know the truth, You should not fully believe even what we say. Until you see for yourself that what we are saying is real; You are human, and you should stand firm in your self-respect, Not letting yourself be overwhelmed by whatever someone tells or writes to you. That is not a sign of humanity at all. A person who, standing on their own, tells God that 'You do not exist,' Is far better Than the one who says to God, 'Yes, You exist.' In Sahaja Yoga, we don't engage with people who are dependent on others. Yesterday, I told you that in Sahaja Yoga, Your innocence is very important; But independence is extremely necessary. And so, you must sit with an extremely independent mind, Neither accepting us, Nor rejecting us, until you have experienced it yourself.

Whatever we are saying, Until you achieve self-realization, you cannot understand. You simply cannot know it, Whatever it is that we are saying. Just like if you don't have a connection, Making any phone call is meaningless. At the very least, At the very least, when a person wants to know about religion, Realization is the minimum required state; Before that, a person Is not worthy of understanding religion. As in our country, it was said in the past That only a Brahmin could understand religion; But the meaning of 'Brahmin' was someone who is realized. Not every person was considered a Brahmin. Today, I told you that I will will take up the concepts of Prashta Brahma and other topics. That will be discussed. I have explained before That just like a seed, Within it, The blueprint of everything that will emerge from it is present, In the same way, consider the idea of a Brahman essence, That there is a seed of Brahman essence, Which has no beginning and no end, Because the tree comes from the seed, and the seed comes from the tree, Which is eternal. Brahm In such a seed form, You are standing in your awareness.

This Brahman... The state is like an ordinary seed which is endowed with creative power, just like a small seed has its germinating power or its creative power within it. Similarly, this Brahma also has its creative power. And when it first bursts forth, when it first starts to vibrate, when it first vibrates, then the establishment of Pranava occurs, the establishment of that power happens. And that power, detaching itself from the seed, establishes itself in its ego and creates the entire Earth. And the seed, assuming the form of God, observes this play. Just like a television is kept, He watches it, if He likes the play, He watches it, and if He doesn’t like it, He switches it off. This very God is known in our scriptures by the name of Shiva. And that power is called Shivani. We refer to it as Mahashiva, and others call it Supreme, Father, God, Paramatma, and the Holy Ghost.

Others call it the Holy Ghost, soul, and various other names. We refer to it as Mahashiva. This very power creates all of creation. When this power begins to create, at that time, it creates in its own manner, it has its own way. When it reaches the human state, this power, as I told you yesterday, is a material element and one is conscious; these two elements create the entire universe. When the conscious element works on the material element, then the creation of the universe happens, and the entire universe is formed. Continuing, we reach the human state. I have explained this in detail many times, but today I specifically want to focus on Kundalini, so I want to reach there quickly. When the material power in humans in the form of a small child, in the mother's womb, in the stage of two to three years, or two to three months, vibrates for the first time, at that moment, in its heart, the first vibration that occurs, the first vibration that happens in the child’s heart is of God. That is what we call the soul.

Paramatma first manifests in our body in the form of the soul. And the power, from our head, pierces through the crown region and enters into our spine, which is the spinal cord, and passes through it, and in the triangular shape settles in this sacrum bone. Whether it settles there or not, whether it exists there or not, what is its state, whether it is real or not, you might ask, why should we believe it? You shouldn't believe it at all, but I can show it to you. Even if you are not realized, if you have eyes, if you are not blind, then you can see, that the Kundalini is situated there, that it is situated there as Kundalini, and immediately it starts vibrating there, even in the triangular bone. There is no reason for a triangular bone to vibrate, because there is no heart there, there is no heart there, But there you can see that, if the person is wearing any clothing, it moves up and down, and sometimes it moves very vigorously. Then you see that when this thing rises up. While it's rising up, it pulsates at certain places, and in some places, the pulsation is so intense and visible , that, like at the heart chakra, where it's at the back, Here you may seem that as if the cloth is lifting up. It is lifting up. For this, whatever, we conducted the experiments and tests, That people have witnessed with their own eyes.

Those who say that Kundalini does not exist, who do not believe in Kundalini, should come once and see for themselves that there is something called Kundalini within you, there is something called Shakti within you, and it is in your triangular bone, not anywhere else. You can witness it directly. You can see with your own naked eyes that Kundalini is within you. After that, you also see that slowly, it feels like something is moving in your back. For some, just by looking at us, it feels as if something is moving quickly. This is due to the merits accumulated in their previous lives. The merits they have gathered manifest instantly and the Kundalini rises forcefully. And for some, there are obstructions. It rises slowly, then goes back down, and some feel heat. The reason for this is that within you, the path of the Kundalini is as I am showing you here, like this, related to a hole as if it can be pulled from here and from there.

You see this, right? These two other powers are within us, which are Ida and Pingala; I will talk about them tomorrow. Due to some reason or another, they pull this path towards themselves, and because of this, the path becomes blocked, and the Kundalini cannot rise, it gets stuck where the path is blocked. This Kundalini is the manifest Chaitanya Shakti. I explained about Chaitanya to you yesterday, that Chaitanya knows everything. Chaitanya recognizes everything. Not only that, but the entire creation of the universe is done by Chaitanya. And Chaitanya is love. This Kundalini is also the embodiment of love, your own mother. There is a slight difference, your own mother has no other child; she knows everything about you.

Like a tape recorder, she has recorded everything within her, what faults this child has, what difficulties it faces, what pain is in its body, what suffering its mother has, what troubles it has gone through. This is all manifest, In today’s modern era, if anyone talks about Kundalini, people will mock them. But in these times, while you are waving the thousand huge banners of science, the moment has come that you will again have to look up towards the path of Dharma, because science has now realized that what we have known so far. In medical science, cancer... What is cancer? No one really understands. Those who boast about science with pride and arrogance, let them explain cancer to me. There are many great doctors, but they can't explain it. I'll tell you, cancer is exactly what I said earlier, that... ...due to the Sympathetic Nervous System, the actions there of... due to it’s overactivity it happens, and there is no cure for it ...other than Sahaja Yoga. Today, I’m saying this; people might accept it after ten years, ...but by then, who knows how many people will be afflicted with cancer. The world is strange, ...when you discover something, ...the human mind is such that it finds something, and then hangs him, ...ignores him.

But after death, ...temples will be built for them, and ...they will be honored. Today, while I am alive, I’m telling you ...what this disease called cancer is. I say it's the overactivity of the Sympathetic Nervous System. Even doctors are now ready to listen. But if one or two doctors get cancer themselves, ...they come to Mataji’s feet. ...But then, Mataji doesn’t have time. Because I am ...more focused on realization, not cancer. But if doctors would open their eyes ...and try to understand this, ...and not worry about what will happen to their money, ...then they themselves could treat this disease, ...and heal people. The scientific approach about Kundalini, If you want to ask... then I would say, you believe in your eyes, don't you? If you do, then see with your eyes ...that if under someone's lower back bone, there is a pulsation After all, what is that?

And after it happens, ...while you are fully aware, ...if this state of thoughtlessness is being established ...then what is that thing that is making you thoughtless? Ask the biggest psychologists if they can establish this state of thoughtlessness within us. They might your breath and calm your mind, ...but if they can bring you to that inner silence and peace ...while you are fully conscious, then ...we will agree that your science is great. Without inner peace, we cannot bring peace outside. But open all the books of psychology and read them, ...and go to any psychologist and see if they are at peace. How can they treat us when they themselves are afflicted by the same things we are? But no matter how much I speak, ...or how much I try to explain, ...take caution, ...this is the era of Kaliyuga, ...and in this Kaliyuga, the time for a great transformation has come. And along with that, the whole world is being arranged because God, ...who is overseeing everything, who is the witness of all, ...is eager to switch you off. He is observing, if the play is fine, it's for us; else calamity. You are seeing what kinds of things are happening in the world today; ...the kind of things the world is facing today; ...there are wars, poverty, ...diseases, it's unbearable to watch.

And no human can find a solution for this. Some say bring communism, ...some say bring socialism, ...some say bring this ideology, others say bring capitalism; But for any of these to succeed--- Without attaining that ultimate bliss, Without gaining the power to play those strings, You can never truly experience joy, And you cannot be satisfied. Satisfaction is found only at the feet of God, But when I speak of God, The modern names come up, Haha, "Mataji, please continue" (Unclear) Everything is fine as long as I talk about science, But as soon as I mention God, it's okay, People have so much ego, They have become so arrogant, who do they think they are? The God who created us And who created the entire universe, We are challenging Him, Who are we to do that? We could be uprooted and thrown away. We see unrighteousness in the name of God, Talking about sex in the name of God, If you do that, Then you are considered a great religious person; Even Kaliyuga (the dark age) has its limits, We are truly drowning in the sins of this era. If you can wash away sins with science, If you can create love with science, then I concede to science. But if our speech remains just a speech, And you experience nothing, and until you achieve nothing even while I'm here, then my coming here and speaking is in vain. Such is the power of Kaliyuga, Such darkness and arrogance have overshadowed us, That we don't consider anyone else but ourselves. The entire creation is not even equal to a speck of dust on His feet, that supreme God.

I don't want to convince you of my words, But one day, I will make you witness it. First, I'm just preparing you. Today's young boys And the society, that’s coming up today, No matter how much you tell them, their brain will not be receptive, The reason is That in the name of religion, great unrighteousness is being established. No one talked about Kundalini, Who talked about Kundalini in those days? The poor ones didn't say anything, and they were still crucified. Kundalini is present within you, And it can be awakened. If you want to see it, come, And if you don't want to see or know it, Then you will have to bear the sufferings of ignorance. But you must at least think one thing, what after all, are we doing, where are we running around , what are we gaining? Within yourself, All the deities are seated within your own body. Now people say, How can Mataji say that there are deities within us?

I will give you proof of that right now. One person complains of stomach pain, they come to us and say, "Mother! I've had pain In my stomach for many days," another comes and says, "We can't have children"; I said, "Okay, look at me." Looking at them, we see that the Kundalini is settled in the Swadhisthana Chakr. A small child will tell you that, there is heat coming from this finger. All the people sitting here, You all will see, with her eyes closed she could tell that there is heat coming from this finger, this thumb. What more science can there be? Everyone says the same thing, that they feel heat in this part. I am not telling you this, When asked what illness they have, they say, "I have pain in the lower abdomen," Someone says, "I have trouble urinating," And someone else says, "I cannot have children." All these diseases related to the autonomic plexus, Which are driven by the Swadhisthan And you can feel it right there, Now what more proof can I give you that Even a two-year-old child will point to this thumb, And everyone will point to this thumb and say, "Mother, here!"

And then when I tell that person, "Okay, take the name of Brahmadev and Saraswati;" As soon as they take it, they immediately say, "Mother! My pain is gone." Now, do you need more proof than this? Brahmadev and Saraswati are sitting right there in person. If they weren't there, how would this work be done? And if you take anyone else's name, nothing will happen. What more proof do I need to give you all? Whether you call it rational or irrational, Those who see this and still don't believe it Those who have a problem in their Muladhara chakra, They feel heat there. If there is a strong obstruction there, an obstruction as it's called, Or if someone in that society is possessed by a spirit, where he sits, Then they feel a strong heat, even to the point of getting blisters. Many people who are moving around, call themselves God and so on, Forget them, even their disciples experience it, and blisters appear on their hands.

Their hands get burned, Their fingers get burned, all of their fingers get burned together. My granddaughter, who is two years old, is born realized. She runs away from everyone. Everyone feels burning in just one finger. If everyone feels burning in just one finger, then there's a catch in their Agnya chakra. And on the Agnya chakra where the cross is, Jesus Christ sacrificed himself on it. And Jesus Christ is there, whether you are a Christian or not, His presence is evident. Those who call self Hindus and those who call self Christians Everyone thinks of ways to create enmity, But no one thinks of ways to love. Everyone has here inside place for Jesus Christ, and right there is Lord Ganesha Who is the personification of Omkar. The recognition is that Lord Ganesha had no father, and neither did Jesus.

But if there's a lunatic person, Or someone possessed by a spirit, or someone mentally deficient, And if they come in front of us, Then, when we are helping them, or freeing their Agnya chakra, if we tell them To take the name of Jesus Christ, the Agnya chakra will immediately open. How do we know this? That’s not a question because we just know. And even with this happening, If you still don't believe That each chakra has a specific deity, Which the Adi Shakti has established from the beginning, Long before you even existed, And those who are fighting among themselves, They should also know That the Gurus they are fighting for are one and the same. Like we say about Muhammad Sahib and Guru Nanak, Muhammad Sahib and Guru Nanak were the same person, This is something we can show from Guru Nanak's life itself! Once, when Guru Nanak was lying down, people said, "Why are your feet towards Mecca? The Kaaba is in that direction, how can you lie with your feet towards it?" He said, "Okay, I'll turn my feet the other way," and the Kaaba moved. What is the Kaaba but the dust of Muhammad Sahib's feet, and it is the same for Guru Nanak Sahib. Because they are the same person, and we show you this recognition through the Kundalini.

When someone gets cancer, Either Guru Nanak Sahib can cure it, or Muhammad Sahib can, no one else. In our Void, In this place that we call Void, Which doctors call Chance, Which we call the Bhavasagara, The one who get us cross the Bhavasagara is the Adi Guru Dattatreya, All these are their incarnations. Without taking the name of any one of them, The ailments of void in you that lead to cancer, The sign of cancer is that here, the Kundalini strikes rapidly; You cannot be cured. I want to ask, how many Muslims and how many Sikhs are here? Muhammad Sahib forbade one thing, which was drinking alcohol. He said not to touch it and said nothing else, for that he was even murdered. We know, in what condition he was put to . And today, I want to ask Muslims, they will surely drink alcohol. And if a little is left in the mosque, they start fighting. And they surely drink alcohol.

And not just that, they even write poetry about alcohol, making it divine. When our Guru showed us the path of truth, They constantly strive to break that path and engage in hatred for themselves. They are thinking of spreading hatred throughout the world. So, what can be done? And in that, the ego... It is so deeply hidden, so subtly hidden within us, this ego. This ego was given to you specifically, "Aham Karoti," to make you act. What is my role? To attain it, to carry out its work? I was given the power; What is a brush meant to do?

It is meant to completely support the hands of an artist, to surrender itself. But instead of surrendering, this ego has infiltrated it. The entry is made. We have seen its form too, Sometimes the Arabs are puffed up, sometimes these people, Sometimes they are puffed up; everyone's days are about to change. You should know That if any harm comes to any country in any way, Not just the country, but the entire world will be destroyed. The same goes for every person. If there is no harm within us, The force that created this entire universe, The subtle thread that flows through all of us, Will be shocked. And what scientific proof do you want? There is no scientific proof that is enough for the blind. For them, the strange thing is that a woman folk, And that too a housewife, how does she know all these things?

Who was Sita, who was Radha, and who was Marry? Were they some great scholars from somewhere? For you to know , Let a little love flourish within you. We will settle your Kundalini. because it is the embodiment of love, It loves you immensely, and when a person loves someone immensely, What do they want that this love must enwrap the whole world. Because the supreme joy of giving love wants that it must be embraced by you, and by them, and by everyone. Everything we do for this supreme joy is only for the glow of this love. You have been adorned for this light of love, as I said. Your lamp will be lit, but kept hidden. You have been chosen for a great work, You are the chosen ones, selected from thousands, chosen from thousands.

Later, do not say that Mother did not tell this or that; We are ready to tell everything and will explain it in your ears. And there is protection for you in every way. You don't need to run away to the forests from the world, there is no need. You don't need to do any abnormal work. Within you, living in your household, within your children, this beautiful work will happen. And... Spring has arrived, and you are unaware of it, The flowers décor is must to be, you who are sitting in front. I should hope that somehow, in front of me, I wish to let that fragrance flow into your hearts. And then you will look at each other and say, yes, yes, yes, What a beauty, what fragrance. Of all the beautiful creations in this world, it is man who is the most beautiful. Nothing is as beautiful as man.

Such a beautiful thing has been created, It is indeed very divine. And this love that knows in these vibrations, this love that understands, that recognizes and embraces this joy, There is only one thing, and that is man. In such a beautiful human heart, I only wish that there may be a vision of that joy and then, he will receive that joy in abundance. Some of you are sitting with your hands towards me, And in the hands of some of you, there is a coolness, like... it comes from an air conditioner, a cool breeze is coming. Put your hands on your head and see, towards your love, in your mind, and you will see that no thoughts are coming; thoughts will stop. But you are aware, fully aware. You will see that your...
