Public Program Day 2, Banglore, India, 13-02-1990

Now the truth is, you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions. But you are the Spirit. And another truth is that all this Universe is guided, nourished, looked after, ultimately [UNCLEAR] by a very subtle energy which is called as paramchaitanya. In the Koran, it is called as “rooh”. In the Bible, it is called the Holy Ghost.

This truth is [UNCLEAR] and you must understand it as a hypothesis. And you need not accept it. You have to keep yourself open. There should be no [UNCLEAR/bias about it]. No bias. Unless and until you feel the pulsation on your central nervous system, you are not to believe what I am saying.

But that does not mean that you deny it. [UNCLEAR sentence/just to avoid]. In the same way, if you try to see for yourself, you will be amazed that you are the Spirit, and we are [UNCLEAR/part] of the all-pervading power of love and compassion. Yesterday [UNCLEAR sentence]. But today [UNCLEAR], I would like to tell you something about this power [UNCLEAR], connects us to the all-pervading power [UNCLEAR].

In the triangular bone, at the base of the spine, which is called the sacrum bone, is placed this power – which is called Kundalini. Kundalini means coil and it is placed there in three and a half coils. [UNCLEAR]. This power resides in the sacrum bone. Sacrum means sacred. That means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone. That they should call it sacrum. In Latin sacrum means sacred.

This triangular bone contains within us, this power which is lying in a dormant state. Now there are three [UNCLEAR/nadis] within us, [UNCLEAR], the left and right sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. We call it the autonomous nervous system. When we call it autonomous, who is this “auto”? Who is this auto who manages [UNCLEAR/the whole show]?

So, just to give it a name, doctors call it the autonomous nervous system. The left side is a channel, which is called the Ida Nadi or the moon Nadi. Is the channel for storing of our subconscious. So, we have the conscious mind, and we have the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is [UNCLEAR] and beyond that is the collective subconscious, where whatever is there since the whole Creation is stored.

On the other hand, is the Pingala Nadi. This is the centre of the sun. Here we have all the [UNCLEAR/ideas of the future], all the futuristic people inside. This Sun Nadi is used for our physical or mental work. Whatever physical work we do or mental work we do, we have to use this right-side channel.

Now on the left-hand side, we have the power of [UNCLEAR/mind] or emotion. And on the right-hand side, we have the power of action. So, the left-hand side is called as “kriya shakti”, not left-hand side, the right one is called as kriya shakti and the left hand one is called as “mana shakti” or “iccha shakti” (mind power or desire power).

When these two channels go into action, they create two [UNCLEAR/illusions] on top of our head. The one which is the kriya, when we put some effort thinks, when it starts thinking that “I am very great, I am like this, [UNCLEAR]”, then this illusion called ego is created like a balloon. And when [UNCLEAR/sanskaras], then [UNCLEAR/our active mana and also past], which we call as superego but in the Sanskrit language, “mana”.

These two join together and they join together and form a cloud [UNCLEAR]. And by the time we are twelve years old, the calcification is complete. Thus, we become a person [UNCLEAR]. In the sense, [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR]. You are not aware but [UNCLEAR], innocence, one which is completely one with the all-pervading power.

This Kundalini is the individual mother of each and every one. She knows each and everything about you. Like a tape recorder, she has full knowledge of what you are. What are your [UNCLEAR/experiences]? What are your [UNCLEAR]? What you [UNCLEAR]. And she is just waiting for the moment to be awakened when she can pass through the six centres and connect you to the all-pervading power, [UNCLEAR/which is a subtle power].

Just like this instrument is made – unless and until it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning. We too have no meaning if we are not connected to [UNCLEAR]. So, this power is the one which connects us to the all-pervading power.

But Kundalini awakening is a process which is a living process, of a living energy, of a living God. Just like a seed sprouts in the Mother Earth, in the same way, the Kundalini sprouts. She rises and ultimately, establishes your Self-realisation. In some people, it immediately happens. In some people, it takes a little time to get established.

The method today is that en masse realisation can be given to people. You can get this en masse realisation. You do not have to do any sacrifices, you do not have to do any exercises, you do not have to depend on anyone. Because of your [UNCLEAR/previous births that desires]. [UNCLEAR]. So, we have to [UNCLEAR] and not condemn ourselves. How can we get realisation? This attitude should be changed and you should have a very [UNCLEAR] about yourself.

Above that are placed six centres and below that is placed the seventh centre. Or we can call it as the first centre. This centre is important; Shri Ganesha – because it has innocence as its quality. It has got innocence. [UNCLEAR statment], but gradually the fontanelle bone area gets calcified.

But innocence is never lost. After your Kundalini awakening it [UNCLEAR/saintly and holy]. [UNCLEAR passage]. Now Kundalini awakening helps us restore our centres. [UNCLEAR passage].

Now the second centre gives creativity. For most of the people [UNCLEAR statement]. Now the second centre, as I told you, is called as Swadishthana. Now this centre has a very crucial role. And that crucial role is that it converts fats in [UNCLEAR] for grey [UNCLEAR/cells] in the brain. [UNCLEAR passages]. Also, this centre has to look after your liver. It has to look after your pancreas, your spleen, part of your breathing and also [UNCLEAR]. All this work it has to do.

Now those people who are [UNCLEAR] and all the time running, use this centre [UNCLEAR]. Under these circumstances all the organs [UNCLEAR]. As a result [UNCLEAR] you get a bad liver. People who are [UNCLEAR], they get a very bad liver. And the main function of the liver is to take out the heat from your body and cool down the bloodstream. This function becomes [UNCLEAR statement]. Then [UNCLEAR] and the person gets very heated up, hot-tempered and [UNCLEAR].

[UNCLEAR passage]. The second function as I told you is of the pancreas. The pancreas also goes out of order and people develop diabetes. In Maharashtra villages [UNCLEAR/also], the people add so much sugar that the spoon must stand up in the cup. They do not get diabetes at all because [UNCLEAR]; they are not bothered. They don’t have to worry about it. [UNCLEAR] eat sugar and all kinds of nonsense.

They are happy and such people do not get diabetes. But people who are too much futuristic; even if they take a little bit of sugar, they cannot [UNCLEAR]. It is because [UNCLEAR]. And we believe in Sahaja Yoga it can be cured. It can be cured very well.

The third one is the most dangerous organ – is the spleen. The spleen is the speedometer. [UNCLEAR statement]. It takes to all kinds of activities [UNCLEAR]. But, in these modern times, we have no time. Early in the morning, we get up and we get shocked. Because we read the newspaper, [UNCLEAR/all kinds of shocks]. Also [UNCLEAR].

Now, this spleen has been created for the purpose of any emergency that might happen. And it goes in a hectic [UNCLEAR]. And it does not know, every time there is a shock, it goes in a [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] we go on. [UNCLEAR passage]. And then suddenly if it is triggered, people get blood cancer.

[UNCLEAR passage/doctors treating blood cancer]. We had patients who were told in eight days they were going to die. Now eight years have passed, they are alive, [UNCLEAR]. Through Sahaja Yoga, you can cure cancer.

[UNCLEAR for one minute].

So, then you are completely in command. To give an example, we take the example of a car. The car has got [UNCLEAR/accelerator and brake]. If you use only one, the car is going to [UNCLEAR/fail]. So, we have to use both [UNCLEAR]. In the same way, the left side is the brake, the right side is the accelerator. And we have to learn how to use these two [UNCLEAR/forces together].

Once we know that, we become automatically a driver. And we don’t [UNCLEAR]. We automatically drive the car. But still, the mastery is with us. But, when you become the master, then ultimately the driver is you, the brake is you and the accelerator is you and you become the master of that. This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga. And [UNCLEAR/when a person come to you], you know what the problem is, how to control it, how to manage it and how to [UNCLEAR].

The first thing that happens to you, is that your pupils get dilated when the Kundalini rise and [UNCLEAR statement] when it passes through the Agyna chakra. After that, you start feeling the cool breeze flowing out of your hands from the ten fingers. And you also start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head when the Kundalini rises. These are the first few symptoms that you first have; that you heard about it [UNCLEAR].

This is the first time you start feeling, the first time you start knowing. Knowing does not mean [UNCLEAR/meditation]. [UNCLEAR for almost a minute and a half/Shri Mataji is describing how you become dynamic and get into the new awareness - “samuhik chetna” means collective consciousness. What the cool breeze or chetna flowing from the hands means].

You can feel your own [UNCLEAR/vibrations] and the [UNCLEAR/vibrations] of others. [UNCLEAR for several seconds]. All the Sahaja Yogis will say the same thing. Supposing there is one person and he says that [UNCLEAR]. They will all come and say that “Mother, [UNCLEAR/Right Heart is catching]”.

[UNCLEAR]. He will come and ask Me, “Mother why was everybody asking me about my father?”. I say, “Because the right finger represents your father”. [UNCLEAR]. “Everybody came and asked me the same question, ‘What about your father?”.

So, [UNCLEAR for next four minutes till Mother concludes the talk/Gist – Shri Mataji says about the vibrations are absolute. Saha means “with you” and ja means “born”. And that the process of Kundalini rising is scientific. Unless the Kundalini rises there is no use in saying mantras. It is such a simple method.

Shri Mataji says a lot of time was spent the day before in answering questions, so would like to have the realisation today. If anyone has questions, they should ask them but not to be aggressive with Her. Mother has come to share the knowledge but there is no obligation. There is no guarantee of Kundalini rising because it depends on the Kundalini and she has to be looked after].

Shri Mataji: May God Bless You.

[Break in video].

Shri Mataji: Place your hand on your heart.

Then we place the right hand in corner of our neck and turn as far as possible and [UNCLEAR] your neck. This is the centre which is [UNCLEAR/the most caught up] because you all the time feel guilty.

Now we take our hand on the forehead, across and press it on both the sides.

This is the centre for asking forgiveness.

Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head and push back as far as possible.

This is the centre where you ask for forgiveness from the Divine. But you are not to feel guilty or [UNCLEAR] about it.

Now we stretch our (right)hand, at the centre of the palm and put it on the talu, the soft bone which is called as brahmarandra. Push down your fingers as much as possible so that the pressure is felt on the [UNCLEAR/talu].

[Break in video].

Put your hand and then I will you when you have to open your eyes.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

[UNCLEAR sentence].

Now you close your eyes. Here you ask Me a question. A very fundamental question.

“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji if you want.

Please ask this question three times.

“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

In your heart.

“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

[UNCLEAR sentence].

Now take down this hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

Here again, you have to ask the fundamental question, “Mother, am I my own master?” Mother, am I my own guru?”.

Please ask this question three times.

Now, take down your right hand to the lower portion of your abdomen.

(To someone): You can come in.

Take now your hand [UNCLEAR].

Here, I respect your freedom. And the pure knowledge cannot be forced on you.

You have to ask for it. In your own freedom.

So please ask this time, “Mother, please give Me pure knowledge”.

Six times as this centre has six [UNCLEAR/petals].

Six times [UNCLEAR].

“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”.

As soon as you ask the question, the Kundalini starts rising.

So, we have to make way for that on the upper side [UNCLEAR].

So now place your right hand on the upper side of the abdomen on the left-hand side and ask. And here say with full confidence, “Mother, I am my own guru. Mother, I am my own master”.

Please say this time times, with full confidence. Anyone of these. Ten times. With full confidence.

I have already told you, that the greatest truth is that – you are not this body, not this mind, not these emotions, not this [UNCLEAR/seeking?] but you are the Spirit.

Here put your right hand on the heart and say with full confidence, “Mother, I am the Spirit”. Twelve times.

“Mother, I am the Spirit”. “Mother, I am the Spirit”. Please say this twelve times.

So just raise your hand to the corner of the left (shoulder). Put your hand to the corner between the neck and shoulder and turn your face to the right.

Here we have to say, again with full confidence, sixteen times –“Mother, I am not guilty at all”. Say it. “Mother, I am not guilty at all”. Sixteen times.

Now, you have to forgive everyone. You might say, “It is very difficult to forgive”. But whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you do not forgive, you definitely play into wrong hands.

So now, raise your right hand. Put it on your forehead across and put down your head. Now press it both sides, keeping your left hand towards Me. And here, you have to say without thinking who you have to forgive, what you have to forgive, in a very general way. Say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

Say it from your heart. Not how many times. But say it from your heart.

Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head. And push back your head on your hand as far as it is possible. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, [UNCLEAR], for your own satisfaction, only once, “If I have made any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”. Say it again from your heart.

Now, stretch your hand fully. And the centre of your palm and place it on the soft bone known as talu or the fontanelle bone area. Now press it very hard. This is very important. Press it hard and push back your [UNCLEAR]. Proper.

Now, here again, I cannot force atmasakshatkara or Self-realisation. You have to ask it again. [UNCLEAR sentence]. “Mother, please give me my Self-realisation”. You have to ask for it.

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone several times].

Please open your eyes. Now raise your right hand towards Me like this. And put your left hand (on the talu) and see for yourself. Not the top of your head. Your left hand. Away from it (above).

See if there is a cool breeze coming from the fontanelle bone area. [UNCLEAR sentence]. Again. Now see if there is a cool breeze coming or not.

Now take your left hand and put it like this (towards Mother). Now take your right hand on [UNCLEAR/the head] and see if the cool breeze is coming. If the cool breeze is [UNCLEAR], hot breeze. Doesn’t matter. After some time the cool breeze will come. Just see for yourself.

Put your right hand towards Me again and your left hand up. And see for yourself. If there is a cool breeze coming out.

Now raise both your hands towards the sky and push back your head. And ask the question three times, “Mother, is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this cool breeze the all-pervading power of the Sadashiva? Mother is this the paramchaitanya?”. Anyone of these. You can ask the question, three times.

Now, see Me without thinking. Those who have the cool breeze from the fontanelle bone area or from your fingertips; little hot does not matter – please raise both your hands.

May God Bless You. So many of you. So many of you. Maybe some of you did not get it just now. Does not matter. [UNCLEAR sentence]. Now you have felt the cool breeze for the first time. This is the sprouting. You must attend our centres. No money will be charged. Nothing will be asked for.

Give some time for yourself and honour your Self-realisation. And practice this and become your own masters.

May God Bless You.
