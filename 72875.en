My salutations to all the devoted seekers in Pune. Today in Pune [Unclear] I have been coming here for almost twelve years. And every time I see that there is gradual progress being made. Many people are coming to Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is a living activity. It is not a dead activity. That you came and paid four annas [Editor- money, specifically- one quarter of a rupee] and became a member. This activity is not that you wear certain type of clothes and you become a Sahaja Yogi. Or when you put on a certain type of badge and you become a Sahaja Yogi. This is a living activity and it is the activity of our evolution. That is, we have to become something else, Tukaram said, 'Amhi Bi gadlo Tumcha Bi gadla Pahije*', [We have transformed, now you have to transform.] And until that happens, you cannot become a Sahaja Yogi. Any living activity takes time. Suppose you want to make plastic flowers. How much time will it take? A machine for making plastic flowers, it doesn't require any time. But if you want to make real ones, only one or two flowers come on the tree. And gradually many flowers come into them. There comes a special moment, rather, a time, then at that time, the entire creation blossoms. And as those many flowers [come into fruition?], this is the moment today. This is the day today.

These days, which we call the dark age of Kali Yuga, though they may be so, are also the days when the Paramchaitanya will be fulfilled, so nowadays instead of calling it Kali Yuga, it is called Krita Yuga. So a special time has come and at this time many people will attain it. This power, Kundalini, is within us all. For it, I do not have to go out. We will not have to search for it, it is within all of us, it is only, in its dormant state. Similarly, in our heart, is the form of Sadashiva, or the form of Shiva as the spirit. It is a reflection in our heart. Both these things are present within us. Only when this Kundalini awakens and it pierces the Brahmarandra [fontanelle bone], then the light of the spirit will come into our attention. Our attention is outside at this time. To pull that attention inside, this process should take place and as soon as this process takes place, our attention is pulled inside and the light of the spirit comes in the attention. It is a very simple thing.

Imagine you've seen gas lights. In them, tiny flickering flames burn—suppose that represents the soul. And the stream of gas itself, think of that as the Kundalini. When the Kundalini merely flows without being ignited by light, it remains dim; it doesn't radiate light, it doesn't emit warmth, and it doesn't fulfill its purpose. Similarly for Kundalini. Until the light of the soul, its piercing, lit by its tiny flame, the human attention remains in darkness. And in that darkness, we do many things. Because of this darkness, our movements and tendencies become restless. Where to run, where to go, what to do, how to proceed- we’re constantly worried. If we walk here, this happens; if we bend there, that happens. Over here, it looks dark; over there, there seems to be a deep pit and how do we cross it? The deeper the darkness, the more difficulty we face in walking, in seeing, and similarly, the more mental distress a person experiences.

But suppose somehow such an arrangement is made that there is a sudden light. In that light we can see everything and we understand what is our connection with others. Where are we sitting, how many people are sitting here, where are all these pillars etc. and then we do not attack each other or stumble on an object. When a person sees this light, we say that he has attained self-realization. The many saints in Maharashtra, one [I] mentioned Dnyaneshwar, were all born as realized. They did not achieve realization by coming to this world, they were born-realized. They attained this realization by doing penance for many lifetimes. And those realized people came to this world and they came and did all this work to prepare you people. But in that work there is always a human tendency that they want to come up with something new. Then humans know [unclear] how to destroy the root of whatever has been done. Look at any country where there have been great incarnations, people [unclear]. And, it is the same here. Here too, we have over-analysed and over-analysed and over-analysed everything that the saints and sages have said, and finally reached a point where they dont exist, they have no connection at all.

However, this is the time when many people [have?] their realisation. Now, realisation means that if your Kundalini awakens, then you establish a connection with the all-pervading loving creation of God [Parameshwar]. And his Ritambara Pragna, she showers love on you and in the fulfillment of that shower of love, many things manifest because of it. The first thing is that your health improves, the second thing is that you get well mentally, the third thing is that your intellect becomes sharp, the fourth thing is that Dharma [Innate religion] awakens in you, the fifth thing is that you [unclear] of the soul. You are a soul [unclear] but the most [unclear] thing is that you awaken in collective consciousness. That is, your human consciousness today becomes collective. We say that we are all brothers, we are brothers, we do not fight, we are all brothers, we are all one being. Many such [unclear] have emerged in the world. We are all one and we should all remain one. Many people believe that we are a collective [unclear]. So if tomorrow some crisis comes to us, the other will run away. So the truth [unclear] of your mind.

All mental thoughts are there, they are temporary, and they perish. So what happens from inside, what happens in our central nervous system, that is, what happens in our nerves, that is our real progress. And that must happen then we awaken in the collective consciousness. We experience [Jānane] the collective consciousness within us. The word ‘Jnaan’ [knowledge], which comes from ‘Jānane’ [knowing], does not mean intellectual knowledge, which anyone can acquire. But knowing is becoming aware of it.

Now in our hands, there are five chakras in these five fingers - five, six and seven [Shri Mataji shows chakras on Her palm] on the right hand and here too [Shri Mataji shows chakras on Her left palm] there are seven chakras, five, six and seven. We are not aware of these seven chakras. We do not know whether we have chakras or not. Many people might have not even heard of the name chakra. There are seven chakras in us and they are shown here [Shri Mataji looks back], but they are very small, subtle, but still they are in you, and when all those seven chakras are awakened by the awakening of Kundalini, then your fingers become aware of them.

Awareness means that if you look at your hands like this, you will feel in your hands what is the fault in you and what is the fault in others. You will be immediately aware of that, what is the catch today. How are people caught up. This will be visible in both, the collective and in the individual. Previously, you did not know at all where others are and where you are. Means one thing to say, you subtly enter the body of another. It can also be said that you can subtly know the body of another in your own body. When this happens, you are surprised that all this awareness comes into your hands and with this awareness you can improve your own state and improve the state of others.

Now when [we] understand a little about how whose state is, whose state is bad, then people will realize how easy it is. The nadi on our left hand is called the Ida nadi. From this Ida nadi our left sympathetic nervous system is created. Now all our emotions are created by this Ida nadi. And when these emotions are created and due to the use of our emotions, whether due to the result of past events, or due to sanskar [conditionings], whatever work we do and because of it, an arrangement or institution is created in our head, we call it 'mind'. What we call within us as the ‘mind’ is created. But this mind also has three screens. There is one screen which we call the conscious mind. There is a mind which is the subconscious mind. And beyond that subconscious mind, there is another mind where the collective subconscious mind is. That means everything that is dead in the world to this day exists in that collective subconscious.

Now the institution on the right side is called the Pingala Nadi. This Pingala Nadi is our future. Thinking about the future, planning for the future, taking action for the future, all this work is done by the Pingala Nadi on the right side [unclear]. So whatever physical movement we have, whatever futuristic thoughts we have, all this happens with the help of the Pingala Nadi and when this Pingala Nadi is implemented, the arrangement that is created by it, that arrangement is called as the ego.

Then the mind and ego become the two ends of the intellect. It affects the intellect. A person who has more sanskars, bad sanskars, good sanskars, or even just sanskars, his mind is bigger. And the one who has more responsibility, thinks a lot about the next thing and does everything taking a lot of responsibility, his ego increases. In this way, both ego and mind grow in us, and due to the growth of those institutions, we take on a special form, let us say that we have one name, we are one, you are one, you are that, that is, we are all different.

The special reason why this difference comes in us is that until we separate and learn, we will not realize what is wrong and what is right. To know Dharma, to understand our mistakes, to make ourselves completely free, first of all, there must be separation. If a child is studying in school when he is young, we teach him A, B, C and then when he grows up a little, we tell him, now you write, you should be able to write independently. Similarly, God has made man free. Once he is free, he searches for God in his freedom. At first, he searches for God, he feels that there is no cover above him. There is no protection of any kind, he finds protection. He feels that with protection he will reach God. But even after getting protection, he feels that he has not got anything yet. Then he puts attention at other things,at money, power, love etc. useless things he puts attention and thinks that these will bring him happiness, but he does not get happiness. Finally, when he reaches a certain stage, he realizes that there must be something beyond this which we do not yet know, ‘known’ [ngyaat] means that we are not aware of it and we are far from it. When this stage comes, at that time, the arrangement for Kundalini awakening [unclear]. Today that stage has come.

Many people tell me, Mother, we do a lot of bhajans etc. That happened, you did that a lot in your previous lifes. You have done all those things. Now, in this birth it is time to get realisation. All that had to happen, has happened in your previous birth, that is why you have come here today. And now, going further what is the need to repeat it again and again? What is the point of repeating what has already happened a lot? And what many people did, what did they achieve? They got nothing. What they did was your doing, you did it and now are born again and you are doing it again and you will do it again. So, at this time, we should stop for a while and think why did all this.

Performed fasts and rituals, traveled, went here, went there, went on pilgrimages, invoked God, fasted day and night, did various kinds of things. But did not find God. Just now Kulkarni told us that we could not even recognize God. So now something is missing and we should see what is missing. And what is missing is your Atma [spirit], which is the light, which you have not yet attained and you should attain it. It is a very simple matter. This is the background [unclear]

Now, the awakening of the Kundalini is a living activity, so it will happen easily. I have told you that any living activity happens easily. You don't have to make any effort for it, you don't have to do anything, it happens very easily. But the state that has come about in Sahaja Yoga today it has become a Mahayoga. That is, the Kundalini of thousands of people rises at once and people get self-realisation. This must happen. If this did not happen, suppose it happens to one or two people, and two or four realized people came, did we recognise them? We may not have tortured them, but we did not help them either. There is no point in singing their songs after they died. But how did we behave when they were alive, what did we take from them, very few people took something from them.

From this, it is clear that what people need to do, they have to attain it themselves. Others have attained what they have attained, but without you achieving it, what that thing is, what did they achieved if they were enlightened, what was special about them that they didn't make any mistakes, they did not have any vices, they did not go towards anyone's bad things, if you get that thing too, you will become like that. And for that to happen, today is the time that God has [written/ chosen??] and everyone should achieve it at this time. There is nothing special about Me in it.

But you may think that Mataji, this is a very big task, a difficult task. I don't find it difficult at all. I find it easy because I can do it. The work one knows, one finds it easy. Now tomorrow if you tell me to drive a motor [possibly means car], I can't drive a motor, I will go somewhere and hit and cause an accident. But if you tell me to lift the Kundalini, I can do it. What work one knows they can do it, do it easily and there is no need to tell them anything. There is nothing special about that. But people are like “Mataji, You Only?” I said “Me Only what [about that]? If you can do it, then you do it. I will leave and sit down.” But you can't do it. That's why I have to do it, in that there is nothing great about Me, there is nothing special about Me. But to tell the truth, if this work is to be done by Me, then let it be done. What is your problem with it because I am your Mother. And what is needed for motherhood, that perhaps God saw in me, which is why I have been given this power to give you realisation and give you this power.

Now after you have gained power, if you also obediently learn how to awaken Kundalini, how to do good to others, how to awaken them and how to improve your own condition and reach completeness, if you understand a little and work on it with a little [possible humility?], then you too can become a great sadhu, saint and guru. Because this is the time. But at the same time, I think a person falls a little short. He feels that Mataji should do everything. Mataji is doing what is Hers, but you should see what you can do. And at the same time, I think that the deficiency of a person shows itself. And because of that deficiency, those enlightened ones, they struggled all their lives, how much effort they put in all their lives, how much they preached for God, they endured so many brutal attacks for God, people tortured them so badly, they harassed their children, devastated them, still they kept taking the name of God. But we must first acknowledge what we have done for God. What have we done for God? Not even a particle. We want realisation. Now I see that where I live, eight to ten people wait every day. Mataji, heal my son, heal my mother, heal my brother, you heal this one, you heal that one, you get this done, you get that done. I say, what have you done for God

You should add up what you have done. “Yes, yes, I used to go to the temple” and give ten paisa to God. God does not want ten paisa, nothing, he does not want temples built for him, he wants nothing. Is there God in your heart? Even if he is awakened, have you taken care of him? Have you built his temple in your heart? You should see this. If you have not done it, then what right do you have to take the blessings of God? No right. Therefore, that temple should be built and building that temple is a very easy task, not a difficult task. A little effort is required, a little. You don't need to wander in the wilderness like Dnyaneshwar roamed. No one will attack you like Tukaram was attacked, and no one will harass you like people harassed Kabir. Just, you should build your temple with a little ease. You should think proudly about yourself that Mataji has said that you are the temple of God! So if we are all this, what are we doing? Get up and start working. What more do we need? We were singing the sweet songs of the Lord, doing the Lord, the Lord, today if the Lord has awakened in us, what have we not tried? We have not achieved Him. If we think like this in our minds, you can rise and you will be in a very high position [unclear].

Now many people are gathered here, in Pune, each person in this group can give realisation thousands of people. And these are the great Yogis of tomorrow sitting in front of me, these are the Yogis who will go and do great work tomorrow and it will be known in history that just like the Mavale** [Editor- Shivaji’s soldiers], these Yogis did the work of God and established the kingdom of God. But, it should be remembered that it will not work by lagging behind. In that regard, it will not work by finding some escape route, many people find escape routes. And if you find an escape route and leave from here, what to say? What will you gain from that?

But if you make a little effort and come to the kingdom of God, an ocean of joy will rise for you, and in it the Yogis all over the world will accept your brotherhood and come to your service. Not only that, Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh will all be ready to serve you. Apart from that, as many immortals as there are, as many angels will all sing your praises. When you have such immense wealth, you only have to come and stand on stage. You only have one task to come and stand, it is not a big task. I am ready to do the rest of the hard work. Only you have to promise that this opportunity that we have received to work hard, we will fulfill it. If you can give me such a promise, “That Mother, this opportunity that we have received, we will do this work by our own capability and complete dedication.” If you make that resolve in your mind, then this work happens very easily, it does not cost any money, it does not need anything. On the contrary, you will become prosperous, good will happen to you, you very [unclear]. Not only that, you will get many blessings, many miracles will happen to you. And it will keep flowing, and you will want to just keep enjoying the experience.

Therefore, before all that happens, there is a little time, where you are shaky, it should be fixed, this connection should be made right, for that you should do a little bit of work. You don't have to give me anything for that and I'm not saying that you owe me or anything. There is nothing like that. You are a part and parcel of my being. So whatever I have done for you, I am doing it for Myself. My only request is that you step in your own glory. Assume your own personality. And see how great you are and why are you still [unclear] for that greatness. That is, the entire ocean of greatness is lying there and your thirst is still the same. So kindly you should learn all this, it doesn't need anything special, there are centers in Pune where there are Sahaja Yogis, one better than the other, they have earned it by persistent hard work, so I strongly request everyone to take advantage of it.
Applause.
[Speech Ends]

If you have any questions after this, please ask. But don't get up and leave after the speech. You should get the point for which the speech was given. Otherwise, here it is, speech done, lets leave. Let's go to somewhere there is another speech. In Sahaja Yoga, something has to happen, has to happen, I had already said that. There are no plastic flowers here. [Aside Yogi- Ask people to write on paper. Shri Mataji: Are there any?] Write on paper or come and tell people if you have any questions. Ask, ask questions, no problem. Come here and ask questions. [Aside: Yogi says something] It is useless. Women only ask useless questions. Ask questions properly, are you just wasting time? [Seeker- Mataji, if you tell us that the frame of your photo should not have a black frame, it would be good if you clarify it a little].
But what is your love for black so much? [Shri Mataji laughs].
Do I have to reason everything? If once I don't give you, what's the harm in listening to what Mother said? I will tell you what it is [Shri Mataji gets up and goes to the mike] Black is the messenger of the Tamo guna. The messenger of the Tamo guna is the black color. Of darkness [Yogi on the side to Shri Mataji- You can sit down and tell] And the Tamo guna is very much in humans, especially in us.

 [The tape stops abruptly].
