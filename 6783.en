Draft Transcript (4:40; last part of Introduction and the first part of the Talk):

"Dr. Warren: ...... So [UNCLEAR without] further talking, again I would like to introduce to you our Mother, Mataji Nirmala Devi. May I suggest that before you start listening, you can slip your shoes off because that will help you connect yourself to Mother Earth. And simply hold your hands out in a special resting on your lap because the vibrations flow in through your hands and the connection with the Earth will help you feel the vibrations. For those people who've already got it, you know what I mean. For those who are new, be open minded, be like a scientist and just verify the experience for yourself, after it happens.

Shri Mataji: It is nice to see so many people who have got their realization and who are [UNCLEAR a/the] Guru. New York is a very pivotal thing in the history of spirituality. It is absolutely the center most point of a very important Chakra which is Vishuddhi Chakra (Shri Mataji turns around and points out closely to the Vishuddhi Chakra on the Chakra Chart). You are stationed at this point. That's why Americans talk about very big things, of universal things, of universal consciousness. They talk of solving the problems of the world, may talk of the liberty of the whole Universe, and then attention is all very widespread, because you stand at that point. New York is really placed at a very pivotal point, no doubt. That's why you are attacked the most. The attack comes because they know that here is the place one has to attack. The negativity is a cunning. It is very difficult for you people -- who are seekers, who are earnestly seeking, who are a special category, who are the men of God-- to understand  the cunning of the negative. There is no way that you can find it out. Like in India, it's easy because Indian scriptures have described --described them at length, into all details-- what is the hell, how the people who are negative act, how they affect you by their mesmerism, how they take advantage of you, how they come in a garb or wearing the ... as they say ship skills by the booths.

Though we have read about it in the Bible and we have heard about it but still, as Christ's life was only for three or four years we should say, it has not been made so clear cut to us. And naturally, I don't blame you if you were misled.

Actually, I came to New York for nine years back and Warren must have told you. But I found that people still need more maturity here. Because they are busy with their own ideas about things. And they were given more to circuses and elaborate presentations. They would not accept a simple thing of very very simple thing that is Sahaja Yog.

One must know whatever God does is the simplest of all but is also very difficult because it's a mystery. Like a flower becomes a fruit. They've never bothered even to find out how it happen. You cannot explain, can you explain? Can you explain how a seed sprouts? We can't explain anything on that level of how --with all our scientific things we have done, with all our great enterprises, the big things we talk about-- we can not explain, that is the mystery. That is the mystery. And this is what we should know, that these people who come to us create a mystery out of them and try to impress us. As I said before, I don't mind. Let them earn money. ......"
