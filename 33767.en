That's for musicians. OK You. Mhm Sure has to be taken Yeah So I let her think that she What He's I keep Comfortable chairs will they be all right physicians, I don't think so.

You see, because the, she put it only on the ground. They they asked for it to be raised. They came in, had a look and said that you must raise it, but it's soft. I know what you mean by that. But what is that in between? Just raise it up to that point is all right. Why do you want to raise it even higher? They asked. No, no, no. They cannot sit on that, they cannot pay the public.

That's all right. That's That one's It will be very small, I think. You want that for today we had seats. 6. But that is the problem. All right, let's see. You're not to do so. The So what now? What about him? Is it ready?

One of the people there are some new people here. Not many, about 10 or 20, that's all. If the food is ready, you can serve them. If the food is not ready, then they will start to cook. Is the food ready? What I'm saying. Who's a It will take some time for and how when do they start? I mean it's what I'm saying when do they start the've gone home to change.

They're at Paul's to change. They should be back, I'd say probably in half an hour I'd say. Tell them to come out tomorrow. We can telephone, yes, but for the first of all, what is the situation? Can you serve it immediately or what? The food is ready, so you telephone to them. Can you come after one hour because they be gone to change and rest and take it easy. What about their food?

Yeah. Right. Yeah. All right, I'll say a few words. I was like. Sri Masay. Mr. Srivastava. On behalf of Brighton centre, it's my very pleasant duty to welcome. You to this town. And I'd like also to welcome The new people who have not attended.

Any of our programmes prior to this festival. This evening's programme is a musical programme. We're very privileged to have A programme of Indian classical music which will be commencing in about. One hour's time What what we have found. Through Sarioga Is that Music of this kind. Has a certain coefficient and carries vibrations which awaken our senses. And so by listening to. The classical music of India. Really one can enjoy a very deep meditative experience. So I hope that those new people who are here.

Will have such an experience this evening. And really there could not be any more auspicious. occasion in which to Make the acquaintance perhaps of a new art form. Other than in the presence of Shrimataje. So prior to the commencement of the concert, we'll be serving some supper. Which I hope also you'll enjoy very much. Thank you. There's a small one in covered. You go. Thank you to about you say few words.

I Lift him up. You said take it down. No, no, no, I think it's. It's always a problem when I have to say something. Doctor Spiro. And uh Doaa yogis and Sayoginis? I want only to say a few words of Thanks and gratitude for the very Warm and moving welcome which you have accorded on the occasion of The arrival of Shri Mataji here. As you appreciate when I say Shri Mataji, I hesitate a little because she also happens to be my wife and uh. But it's a great credit to her that she's fulfilling both roles so well, that of a wife, a mother, a grandmother. And at the same time, the universal mother.

To me, it's a very great privilege to be asked to be here, to be given the opportunity to be here and to feel that one belongs to this glorious family. I'm serving the United Nations system and uh you know, the United Nations system was established to bring the world together, to unite the world. Unfortunately I cannot say that we have succeeded very well. In fact, if you read the newspapers every morning, you'll probably see more of division than of unity, and yet we persist in our endeavours to unite the world. But what Srimataji is doing and what you are doing is really to create one good, pure, chaste, loving human family. You are giving reality to the ideal of one interdependent humankind. There is a great joy in that, the great satisfaction in that, the great spiritual elevation in that. And all of that, I know you all feel you owe to this lady. Well, I'm sure you're anxious to hear her rather than me. I therefore stop now except to thank you very, very much indeed for your kindness, your affection, and your love.

Thank you. Mhm. No. I bow to all the seekers of truth. And to all those who have found it. Sir yoga is the blessing of modern times. Which is meant for the seekers. Seeking also I find these days has become like a fashion. Oh But there are many who are real seekers. Genuine seeker.

They're trying All their lives To find The source of peace, joy, and bliss. That is the spirit. As you know in yoga. You cannot pay for it. You cannot put in any effort for it. It's your own. It's within you. But after realisation, There's one thing that is lacking. In many seekers, perhaps maybe because they cannot give up this seeking shopping as I call it. You have to have consistent movement upward.

In Sanskrit, it's called sapa. That is something one has to put in. That effort has to go otherwise. realisation Is extremely a temporary phase. It doesn't happen in the countries where there has been a tradition of understanding. What is to be sought? So it must be understood that it is not a mental approach. Or a behavioural change, but it is a complete transformation within, which is important. For that you have to have patience with yourself. You have to forgive yourself.

Actually you have to love yourself. And work it out. Delicate handling, I'm sure all of you can achieve a lot. I was really overwhelmed today by the beautiful expression of your love at the railway station. I felt even the trains and the people who were handling them were all moved with that. It was too much. Just the ocean of love flowing, that's all within you in your heart. It has to flow You have to open your heart, not with any fear. Not with any trouble, not with any, uh, barriers, but just openly, just fluid, and you'll be surprised that everybody is anxious to do that. Everyone is anxious to extend their love to you.

So for those who have come for the first time, I have to tell them, take it easy. Try to understand Do not feel hurt if somebody tells you something. Do not get upset with it. It's a Situation in which you have to be all right. It is you who has to become. Nobody else, it's you who has to gain. With this, if you move, I'm sure, as so many have got realisation, you all will establish it. I do not know how to thank you. I mean, I don't know what to say because people have come from such long distances to express their love. And to Meet me here.

It's too much. For me to say anything. Except I feel that in my childhood, I used to have dreams of having a global family. And I would tell my father that in my family, I'll have as many people as there are stars in the sky. It was But so many are still last, and I don't know how will I meet them, very anxious. I will do whatever is possible. You all should help me there. And those who are not yet established must know that it's God's work. We are in a new age. And we have to understand the seriousness of the whole situation.

Work it out yourself. And then through you God's work will be done beautifully. Blessing the whole universe, that's what we want. As Mr. Shiva has told you that United Nations is doing its work, it's the tree, but the roots are you. You are the roots of the United Nations. If there are no roots, there's no reality. So only if you form organisations, there's no reality. The reality comes from the roots, and you are the roots of all these ideas by which we'll have global peace. Globallis and global emancipation. May God bless you all.

I hope all the new people will achieve their ascent with humility. With humility, may God bless. Mhm. I don't know. I told you, the musicians are going to eat here. They're coming soon. I. 2. I think you Yeah Did you get that. I Yeah OK Have you got a have you got a tape recording?

Can do music. Can you. I'll put it through the system which quickly. OK. Tomorrow night we'll have our our. And then these people will be here for the programme, so I think tomorrow night we all will have our own programme of the surgeries, but today we have, we haven't got so much time. So let's have the dinner and then this programme. And then tomorrow, I don't know what's the programme tomorrow morning? We can't have this. All right, so you can have your own seminar sort of thing of your own, and then in the evening, uh, evening 6 o'clock, we'll have that.

It's so spontaneous. I mean, I was. Uh, I don't know how you are accommodated. I just don't know. I'm quite worried about that, how you are living, but there is love that we can manage. You can tolerate all kinds of things, but love is such a joy giving, such a joy. Nobody minds any discomfort, the comfort of the spirit. So we have to thank the, I don't know, the Sergio of Brighton, all of them and their leader, that all this has done so well. Are you playing some music? Yeah.
