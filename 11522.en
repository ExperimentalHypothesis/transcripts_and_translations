(a conversation with a yogi who speaks with a West Indian accent. During the conversation the yogi mentions that he has a photostat "here with me in London")

Shri Mataji: How are you, Harry?

Harry: Very well, Mother

Shri Mataji: What did you do there?

Harry: Well we stayed ... Warren and I was there for the last week, and we had a few programs. After Warren stayed at the hotel, same hotel that You were in, and then he came and he stayed at the Dr. Worlikar.

He stayed there for two days. And then we had two meetings there - one on a Thursday and one on Sunday.

Shri Mataji: All right.

Harry: And mainly Indians, the Indians came, all of them. And Warren made a tape for them.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Harry: Warren, he made a tape for them. He described all about the chakras and how to raise the Kundalini, and the doctor wanted to know about the medical side of it. So he explained everything on the tape. And they have decided to have regular meetings on Thursdays at his home. Plus, the only two Americans interested were Michael - Michael and Roger.

Shri Mataji: And in Santa Cruz?

Harry: Yeah, well, in Santa Cruz the Indian man, Ravi. His American wife ....

Shri Mataji: Indian man?

Harry: Indian man, Ravi, and his wife was white. She was Danish. We had a meeting there on Thursday. But we tried to get a hall. But he couldn't organize a hall. So and I phoned the old gentleman, the old gentleman who spoke with a hoarse voice and we could not get a ... he said that before that to get a meeting in a savings place. But we tried there but we couldn't get one. So the only place we had the meeting was at the Sikh's place, Mr. Singh's place. You know there was a Sikh gentleman ..

Shri Mataji: You are saying about what?

Harry: Santa Cruz

Shri Mataji: No, that Sikh doesn't stay in Santa Cruz.

Harry: Yeah, but seeing that we couldn't get the place in Santa Monica ...

Shri Mataji: So you went to Santa Cruz.

Harry: Yes. No, we went to the Sikh's place. He lived in ...

Shri Mataji: Santa Monica, you're telling.

Harry: Yeah. Well, we could not get the place in Santa Monica, so the Sikh said we could use his hotel and we had a meeting there and about ten other persons turned up and they were interested.

Shri Mataji: Out of ten, how many were Indians?

Harry: Well, at that meeting there were about two couples.

Shri Mataji: Indians?

Harry: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So the rest of them were six Americans only.

Harry: Yes.

Shri Mataji: How were they?

Harry: Well, they weren't very good because they, they, You see they went to a lot of gurus.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Harry: There was one gentleman, the man who had the cirrhosis, he was very keen. And Michael and Roger.

Shri Mataji: I think there it will work out - Santa Monica. Other, because you had not place, nothing, all problems, you see?

Harry: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So Michael is going to work it out?

Harry: Well, Michael was, he said that he couldn't get the place to stay, and he got very angry, and he said that it was Warren's fault ...

Shri Mataji: What?

Harry: ... that he left Santa Cruz because he had problems with his Mom. He went there to stay.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Harry: He went to stay with his mother.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Harry: Michael, when he came back from Santa Cruz he went to stay with his mother.

Shri Mataji: Michael is the one who was with ...

Harry: Yeah, the one who came to Santa Cruz, on his own and then drove with You to San Francisco.

Shri Mataji: Um.

Harry: Well, he returned and he stayed one night with his mother, and then his mother told him that he has to leave. So he could not get anywhere to stay. So he went to stay with another American, and the other American told him that he couldn't stay there, too. So when I phoned him, he was very angry and he said it's all Warren's fault that, that he told You, so he's going back to Santa Cruz. So he has gone back to Santa Cruz with his ...

Shri Mataji: Such people, they have no money, they have this, they have ...

It's all right. So, Santa Monica, who's going to do that?

Harry: Well, nobody at the moment, because on Thursday we had the meeting at the Indian's place and he was not going to ...

Shri Mataji: but what is happening to this, ah, she is going to stay in Santa Cruz?

Harry: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Do you see her?

Harry: Well, I haven't heard from her, Mother, since she left with You.

Shri Mataji: So, Santa Cruz she might be having. Santa Cruz they are having.

So Santa Monica is finished like this?

Harry: Well, except the Indian man there with the white wife. He'll probably start meetings, but he was saying he cannot allow Americans to go to his home. Because he wasn't sure what sort of people they are and they might come to his house and, and, you know see things, and when he's not there they can come and trouble his wife.

Shri Mataji: Bharkar.

Harry: Yeah, Bharkar. And then he says that for the Indians, the people that he knows, they can have regular meetings. But unless he knows the Americans, they can't come to his home.

Shri Mataji: You see, all hippies. Horrible. And they go to the houses and they eat like gluttons and they take away things. It's true what he says. Look at this Michael. Now, why should he blame anyone if there's no room or something. I mean, Sahaja Yoga is not supposed to give you places.

What he said is true, also. So then why doesn't he arrange, Bharkar, some general public place?

Harry: Yeah. He was talking about having a temple - the place where the Indians, you know, the Indians who are living there they have a meeting hall. So, Mr. Pradhan, Subhash Pradhan, he said that they will try to organize a meeting.

Shri Mataji: But then there will there, they won't allow Americans to go there?

Harry: Yes, it's a open hall. You see, it's a temple in the main building where they have their meetings, and they have small rooms on the side. So they can hire the small rooms.

Shri Mataji: Then that's all right.

In a meeting in Santa Cruz, there were four hundred and fifty hippies facing Me. And the Indians who were with Me got frightened. They're very ego-oriented. And ultimately one of them hit Gregoire.

So either they are very over formal people, Americans are - they'll wear their dark suits, hundreds of darks suits, you see, yards of them. Or they will be absolutely like this. Very dangerous. Very violent.

So he said he'd manage something, Bharkar?

Harry: Yes, but he said it depends upon the other Indians.

Shri Mataji: Uh?

Harry: It depends upon the other Indians. It all depends on Dr. Worlikar now.

Shri Mataji: Doctor?

Harry: Worlikar, the immunology man. It all depends on him.

Shri Mataji: So you write to Dr. Bharkar that Mother was asking about it, to take the help of Dr. Worlikar, because he works in Santa Monica.

And he has got the addresses, has he?

Harry: Yes. Well, I left the addresses before. I kept the addresses and I phoned to all the people.

Shri Mataji: But where are the addresses now?

Harry: Well, I have a photostat copy with me here in London and I left the original with Mr. Singh.

Shri Mataji: So write to Mr. Singh and to Mr. Worlikar, Dr. Worlikar, and to Bharkar. That they should try to arrange something. They can have program at Singh's place. He won't mind, it's over there.

Harry: Yes.
