Public Program, Venice, Italy, 07-05-1986

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

It was such a great joy for me to come to Venice to meet you again. And I know there are many seekers in this place and they are trying to seek the truth. Without finding the truth and without becoming that we cannot talk of peace. The peace resides within us and the human beings who talk of peace themselves are not peaceful. And how can they bring peace when they are not in that state themselves?

To find the truth we feel we have to put in some effort. Because you are seekers and you are frantically trying to find the truth you go to all kinds of extremes: you drink, you drug, you've been to these fake gurus, you've done that whatever a human being can do. But I have come to tell you - you don't have to do anything of such kind. As you have become a human being from the amoeba state spontaneously, in the same way you become the Spirit spontaneously. It is nothing artificial that can work it out or human endeavour that can bring forth the result.

The one who has created us has already built all the arrangements for our ascend. With all his love and attention he has very delicately made all these beautiful chakras within us. At human awareness we do not know what lies within us. We do not know what organs there are in our being. Unless and until there is pain we do not know that they exist. In the same way we are not aware of these centers within us nor can we see the pain of the centers within us because they are subtle and we have to become subtle. But by mental projection we cannot become subtle. By projecting outside we cannot become subtle. It's the projection inside which will work it out.

Now you all are all paying attention to me but if I say, "Pay attention to yourself inside." you cannot do it. This happening of the awakening of the kundalini has to take place. Now this kundalini is actually a name given to the power which is going to give us our Self-realization. This is everybody's individual mother because it is she that gives you your second birth. She knows everything about you and sheâ€™s anxiously waiting to sprout off and emerge out of the last chakra called as Sahasrara.

This happening is real baptism, real. It is not artificial. You cannot baptize someone by just putting your hand on that person. The authority has to come from the Divine for a person to baptize. Such a person is the one who is already united with the Divine. Now this Divine power - the power of love of God, is all-pervading and everywhere. It is described by all the great scriptures and by the great saints. But we cannot feel it. We see these flowers appearing spontaneously on a tree becoming fruits. Who does that work? Who pumps our heart? Who runs our digestion? The doctors call it auto. Who is this auto? If you call a car as automobile then who is the auto in the automobile? Who is the driver? The driver is the Spirit which watches and witnesses whatever we are doing. And kundalini is the one which rises through these six chakras, pierces through the last one here and then connects you to your Spirit, to your auto.

She is the power of pure desire. Now what is our pure desire? Some people want to have a nice house then they want to have a nice car, then they want to have a helicopter - it goes on and on, and on. In general our desires are not satiable. So the so-called desires are not the pure desires. Unless and until when our desire is fulfilled and we do not want anything more - that's the pure desire. Now this pure desire is the kundalini and the desire is only one - to know the truth by a union with the Divine.

In the heart is reflected the God Almighty and Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost - the power of God, that is the Primordial Mother reflected within us. It's a funny concept to have a Father God and a Son God and not a Mother God. How can you have a son without a mother? Mother is so important. So when we say that there is a Holy Ghost, a third thing, that is the Mother. That's the Primordial Mother which is reflected within us as Kundalini and she is the one gives us our Realization.

Now when we are seeking the truth we go with some concepts in our mind: some concepts which have come to us from generations to generations and some concepts are such that we ourselves have visualized. But concepts are all artificial. Supposing sitting down in India I start conceiving, "I am in Venice." will I be there? It cannot be reality. It has to be a reality. So the truth has to be known in reality. And how do we human beings know the reality? It's through our central nervous system, through our nerves, not through our brains.

Now supposing somebody says, "This is marble." and somebody says, "This is no marble." Looking at it I can say it is marble because I come from a country of marble myself. But ordinarily you just place your hands and see. If it is marble it will be cold, if it is plastic it won't be cold. So you can feel on your central nervous system. So when you get your Realization, when you get your kundalini pierced through your fontanel bone area then you do feel the cool breeze on your nervous system, the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, as we say the Cool Breeze of the Adi Shakti.

Now the saints who talked about it were not dishonest people, same about the incarnations. But when you moulded these great saints and incarnations into concepts they became dead. And that's how you find somebody talking about truth in the church, somebody in the temple and another in the mosque. Now truth cannot be many, it has to be one.

Now in modern times, thanks to Sahaja Yoga, it has evolved to such an extent that you can feel on your fingertips those different chakras. There are many things which cannot be explained in the Bible, in the Koran or in any of the Indian books. Unless and until you are a realized soul you cannot understand them. Mohammed Sahib has said that, "At the time of Resurrection your hands will speak." He has talked of Resurrection much more than the Doomsday, but not the people who are in charge of the religion want to talk of the Resurrection. They want to talk of the Doomsday because then they can frighten people and make some money out of them. But logically we can see that how the God Almighty who is love has created us would first give us Doomsday and never the Resurrection?

So the concept about things must be given up and must be prepared like a scientist with an open mind to see the reality. You may read any number of books, you may know all the scriptures by heart but unless and until you are a realized soul you cannot catch the essence. If you talk about the flower and if you talk about the honey - one about the form, another about the formless, you are just talking, talking, talking. You have to become the bee to taste the honey. It is all built-in within you, it's within you, it is there. Like a seed has all the maps of all the trees that are going to come out of it, in a microscopic way you too have the same thing which has to get sprouted.

But we live within two boundaries of concepts with ego and with our conditionings that we have. It's like an egg which is formed and for Resurrection that egg has to become the bird. Today the time has come that many are just ready to get it. This is what is the second birth. And it works out very easily. You don't have to do anything about it. How can you pay for it? How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting a seed? You cannot pay for God's love, can you? He doesn't understand money. What you have to just do is to get your Realization which is sahaja - which is spontaneous, saha-ja - born with, it is spontaneous. It's the yoga which is union with the Divine, it's your right to have it. There is no other way you can have it. Many people think that if you do physical exercises or something like that it is yoga - it is misnomer. If you read Patanjali, it's such a big book out of which only wee bit is, one part of the Ashtanga  is Niyama  out of which a wee bit is the exercise. The rest of it is all Samadhi Yoga.

So the first state you achieve is thoughtless awareness called as Nirvichar Samadhi when you are aware but beyond the thoughts. And when you establish it then you go to the second state called as Nirvicalpa Samadhi meaning the Doubtless Awareness then your hands work miracles. At that state you are absolutely in peace with yourself and with others but you emit peace, you emit auspiciousness. Even a glance of such an innocent personality can resurrect another personality. 

And in modern times it's not difficult to achieve. But many people don't want to believe that it is spontaneous, that you don't have to do anything. It is as simple as one enlighten candle can enlighten another candle. Only you have to work it out when you have to maintain the candle burning. That also you can learn in a month's time at the most. And you can master it so well that you yourself can do miracles on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level. You can comfort people by your touch in their sickness, illness; you can counsel them like great knowledgeable saints. We had so many great saints in the whole world; they never went to any university but what knowledge! So you get complete knowledge which is the knowledge of reality pouring out of you. You become dynamic and all your problems are looked after by the great angels.

But in this country or in the West people are naive about it, where knowledge is that of the tree but not of the roots. I think the saints know much more about Christ than those who talk about Christ. So you become the knowledge, you become the joy and peace. But you become the redeemer of others, you redeem others and evolve them. As in the evolutionary process one fish came out and few came out and then [UNCLEAR] of them came out, in the same way Sahaja Yoga today - thousands and thousands are getting Realization. So only thing I have to request you just to receive your awakening and establish yourself.

I must say I'm very thankful to [UNCLEAR] which has given this whole thing to us because last time we didn't have any proper hall and I didn't know what happened. I just could not relate myself to the crowds that were there properly.

Now there is no need to ask about other people, other gurus and this and that. It's all useless just now.

You first become your own master. I'm not a guru, I'm a mother and I've come here to give what you have. This is all your own, maybe I have to just hand over the key to you so that you become your own guru and gurus of billions, but real gurus, sat gurus.

May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

I wish we had more time but today is the only day we have together and in this short time whatever was possible I've said to you. Now you must be having, some of you, some problems and some questions, I appreciate that. Now if you have any such problem or questions you can write them down and hand them over to Jeremy here which he'll send it over to me and I'll try to see if I can answer them and satisfy you. But please do not .... Just now I don't want to waste time in that. Let us have our Realization because after the experience it's better to understand. If our eyes are not open we cannot see anything and then what's the use of argument? Better to open our eyes and then see for ourselves.

It will take about 15 minutes at the most. I would request you that please do not leave before it is over to disturb others. But if you have to leave you can leave before. It's going to be extremely simple and easy for you.

There are having some funny books which say that Kundalini awakening is dangerous and I can't understand that. When you were born your mother took all the responsibility and the pain upon herself. In the same way the kundalini who is your mother from such a long time is not going to give you any trouble whatsoever. But you have to know that you must respect your Realization, you must respect yourself. There is no time left now to waste - you have to enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy life.

May God bless you all.

(min. 39:13)

We have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot, so just take out your shoes. Sit very comfortably without any asana, sit comfortably in a Sahaj asana. Sahaj asana is with spread out legs, not any tightening; nothing, just stay spread out. Sahaj asana, Sahaj asana is spread out. Be comfortable.

You come forward, yes, please come. Come along, it's alright, the baby will also sit down nicely. Sit down, sit down. It's alright. For her doesn't matter if she is [UNCLEAR] she is alright. She wants to take out her shoes. Children understand, they are not complicated.

Now as he has told you about the chakras I'm going to tell you how to awaken your own kundalini. Of course there is no effort in it but as we have to open different centers with our own will we'll have to just put our hand on the different centers, that's all. On the left side works the whole thing. As you will learn about Sahaja Yoga you will know that the left hand represents the desire, the power of desire. Not the pure desire but the desire power. And the right hand represents the power of action.

So we put our left hand like this on the lap comfortably. And also you can, if there is any pressure on your neck or on your waist, or if you are wearing spectacles also you can take it out later on when I tell you. Later on you'll have to close your eyes completely because the attention has to be sucked in by the kundalini. Like my sari, when the kundalini rises the attention gets sucked in inside; it's spread out, it gets sucked in. [Shri Mataji shows with her sari.] So you have to keep your eyes shut all the time, there is no mesmerism here to keep your eyes open.

But before that I will show you about the chakras. First of all you'll have to put your right hand on your heart, here resides your Spirit. Then you have to put your hand on the upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side. Then you have to put your hand in the lower part of your abdomen pressing it hard, the left hand side again. You have to put it back again on the upper part of your abdomen, then on your heart, then in between your left arm and your neck, or the shoulder - like this and turn your head to your right. Then put your hand on your forehead like this, pressing on both the sides. Then on the back you have to put your head resting on your hand like this, just for a short time. Then you have to stretch your hand and put your palm, the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area pressing your fingers hard you have to move your scalp in such a way slowly, slowly seven times. That's all, it's very simple.

Now all of you should just remember one thing that we are all going to enter into the Kingdom of God and this is what we have been working out for ages and the time has come - this moment, to do that. We should have no guilt about ourselves, we have done nothing wrong whatsoever. On the contrary, we should be very pleasantly placed towards us. Not to be frivolous but not to be serious either, in a very joyous mood.

Now please put the left hand towards me and please close your eyes. Close your eyes and put the right hand on your heart. Now keep your eyes shut and do not open till I tell you. Now at this point you have to ask me a very fundamental question - you can call me "Mother" or you can call me "Shri Mataji", whatever it's convenient - say, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this fundamental question three times. Three times.

Now the second question comes in. If you are the Spirit you are your master too. So now put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side, left hand towards me on the lap. Now here you ask me again a question three times, "Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guru? Mother, am I my own guide?"

Now please this right hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you ask for the knowledge because I cannot force you. It is your freedom which I respect so you have to ask, "Mother, give me the true knowledge of divine laws. Mother, give me the pure knowledge." This you have to say six times, "Mother, give me the pure knowledge." You have to say, I cannot force on you. Six times.

When you say that now the kundalini has started moving. But you do not feel guilty or diffident at all. With confidence you now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side please. Now here with full confidence to open the center of this master principle, or guru principle, you have to say with full confidence ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

Now please raise your right hand again onto your heart. Here you have to say again with full confidence the greatest truth about yourself, "Mother, I am the Spirit" say it twelve times because there are twelve petals to the Heart center. "Mother, I am the Spirit." Now, twelve times please.

Now, I have to tell you that God Almighty is the ocean of love and ocean of compassion but above all he is the ocean of forgiveness. And you cannot do anything that cannot be engulfed by this ocean of forgiveness. So now please forgive yourself and forget about the past please. Be careful.

Now put your right hand in the corner made by your neck and the left shoulder from the front side, not from the back, don't take the hand to the back, take it across, right hand across. Take it on the back and now turn your head toward the right, hold it tight. This is the center catching today mostly because you feel guilty for nothing at all. So sixteen times please say, "Mother, I am not guilty." Sixteen times. And even now if you are feeling guilty then you better punish yourself by saying it 108 times. There is nothing to feel guilty at all.

Now put your hand on top of your forehead across. Now here not how many times but from the heart you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." This is the center of Christ. Now we think that it's very difficult but it's a myth. We do not do anything when we forgive and when we don't forgive. But when we forgive at least we don't play into the hands of wrong people.

Now put your hand on the back of your head and push your head backwards. Now here for your own satisfaction you can say, "Oh, Divine, please forgive me if I've done anything wrong." For your satisfaction but don't feel guilty.

Now put you right hand on top of your head by stretching your palm, the center of it falling on the center of the fontanel bone area, press it hard and move it seven times. And here you have to say seven times because I respect your freedom that you want your Realization, "Mother, please grant us Self-realization." I cannot force it on you, I'm sorry, so you have to ask for it seven times. [Shri Mataji blows in the mike].

Now take down your hand please. Please open your eyes slowly. Put both the hands like this. Now watch me without thinking. Put your left hand on top of your head about 2 - 3 inches above, left hand, right hand towards me like this. Little higher, little higher, sometimes it can be very high also with some people. Like this, the right hand should be like this. You feel the cool breeze?

Now put the left hand towards me and put the right hand and see on top of your head, on top of your head. Again put the right hand towards me, please, and see on the left hand? This is just to balance.

Now you put both your hands to the sky and push back your head and ask the question, "Is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the All-pervading power of God? Is this the Brahma?" Ask the question three times, push back your head, push back your head.

Now bring down your hands. Please bring down your hands. Now see in your hands do you feel the cool breeze? Be patient with yourself, it will be there, just feel it, feel the silence within. You feel like laughing, some of you.

Those who have felt the cool breeze on their heads or in their hands please raise both your hands. Or on your head either. Quite a lot of people have felt on the first day. And everybody can feel it, it's very simple, everybody can feel it. Those who have not felt can sit for one minute like that, just see. Without thinking, just watch me without thinking. I think you all have not forgiven, just forgive and it will work out, just forgive, the pressure is for not forgiving.

Now let us see how many have felt it in head or in the hands, both the hands up. Some of you who didn't feel are feeling now. Good. Now don't discuss about it, don't talk about it.

You are going to have follow-on. All those who have not felt it should also come, they'are more there. And those who have felt should also come and get it out. Because you have been seeking for ages now.

Thank you very much.
