Public Program. Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey), 23 April 2002.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. I’m very happy to see you all here to know about the Truth.Whatever is told about your subtle being is not yet known, because in your awareness you don’t have yet that subtleness. That’s the last, your jump into your awareness of collectivity.I must tell you in this country, that is Turkey, you had so many Sufis. They called themselves Sufis because they were cleaned and they were spiritually empowered. They talked of Ruh (spirit) but nobody knew about Ruh and when they talked of Ruh, they did not know how to explain – they talked of Ruhani life, but they could not explain what is Ruhani (spiritual) life. Ruhani is the life when you are connected with the all-pervading power of Divine love. It’s a different area into which you enter. Because they could not explain, they wrote everything beautifully, describing it. But now the time has come for you to get to your Ruhani life. Which is a very important thing, because you are not connected to the divine power, whatever you may try, how so ever you may pray, how much you will read Qur'an, it won’t help.Human life is governed with jealousy, with temper, with all kinds of malignant things. And we can see all over the world the problems are just spreading. Once they will get into Ruhani life, they will realize that the whole world is one, there is a global existence. What happens is that you jump into the ocean of Love, of pure Love, no lust, no greed, nothing. That’s has to happen because if we are born as human beings, we must get Ruhani life, for which you cannot pay, you cannot read it, you cannot understand it with your human awareness. So, you have to enter into a new dimension of your awareness.Nobody understood those Sufis and they just tortured them, because they were so different, so much higher. Others could not bear it. And today, that is going on, people are fighting all over the world. So this is the life of pure Love; but not forced, not taught, is just, is within you, already existing. You do not know your worth, you do not know what you have. All the saints came here, incarnations came here, prophets came here, nobody understood them. They only killed them because majority of the people were not Ruhani. So, all such ignorant people couldn’t bear the knowledge, the divine knowledge of these great people.Now the time has come for the whole world to become one, and to jump into the sea of Love. Which is very, very simple, it is very easy. As told to you, we have already that power, placed in the triangular bone of sacrum within us by our Creator, which is to be awakened. And once it is awakened, it passes through your centers and clears them, enlightens them, and integrates them. And ultimately, this Kundalini connects you to the divine power. This is what is Miraj (ascension) as described in the Qur’an. And all of you can get this Miraj and once you get it you can experiment and get it on your finger tips the cool breeze... You can feel it on your finger tips. That is the proof. There is no false certificate about it. And ultimately, you can also get it out of your fontanel bone area. This is the last bone which was pulsating as a child, and then it closed. But when the Kundalini pierces through that, then only you can feel the connection as cool breeze coming out of your own being. You have shown so much faith in God, so much faith in Qur'an, so much faith in Islam, but you have to surrender, Islam means to surrender, and then you can achieve this awareness, this higher awareness of divinity within you. After getting these vibrations also, you can develop a power to know what is wrong with you, within, in your chakras. and also you can make out what is wrong with others. That is how your awareness expands, expands to the new dimension of Ruhani.You all have to become Sufis. But now do not write poetry, because people do not understand poetry. They misinterpret. I can also write poetry, but I don`t want because I want you to know directly what is the Truth.Now I must tell you one thing: you have a well-named country called France; among all the European countries, they are the most idiotic people I’ve seen. Extremely dirty, they like to have smelly food... and drink all the time. And they eat such varied cheese, I mean I don’t know how they could eat, even dogs do not. They talk of culture, and they are so immoral. There are 11 countries in the south Africa. Benin is one of them and they all have become Muslims. I asked them: “why did you become Muslims and not Christians like these?”. They said our rulers were these horrible people who were so dirty, so filthy and smelled.So many people tried to... there is a writer called Molière who told about them, made fun of them. And there is a beautiful booklet, novel, written by another writer, who has shown how stupid they are. They have to learn from you. You are so different, you are so capable. I mean I must say you are such a sensible, lovely people; but keep to your sense, keep to your intelligence. I am telling you about French because nowadays they are trying to influence you, also your television. Be careful. They do not know what Ruh is. God knows what sort of Christianity is that, just the opposite of Christ. So please try to keep to your own culture and to your understanding. And you can get your Realization in no time.I came to Turkey, because if you remember Christ’s Mother also came here. And I know why she came here; because the people here are extremely good and so many Sufis. It is such a joyful place. I think you all will get your Realization, no doubt. Those of course who do not want can go. This is a very simple thing.In the meanwhile, I would like you to ask me some questions.

Interpreter: Rumi has a saying. Mevlana Rumi says, if I reveal the secret, either I will burn or people will burn, everyone will burn.

Shri Mataji: That is true, that was the time that. What he said is truth because people don’t understand what is reality, they can’t believe like that,  they can fight back, they tortured Muhammed Sahib, they tortured people.

Interpreter: You said about love, he is thinking to love that you mean, he was just thanking you.

Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you, thank you very much. I am not afraid. They can burn me, I don`t care.

Interpreter: .......... for the purpose of... .. the French people.... You say it's not.

Interpreter: What you said about the French people who acted against world peace, is this cover all French people?

Shri Mataji: I cannot, there are exceptions, of course, there are many  exceptions, no doubt, that`s how I came to normal.

Interpreter: I will ask a question. I am in Reiki. I wonder if Sahaja Yoga has a connection with this? Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Please, I would say, don’t do it.

Interpreter: ......   Why Sahaja Yoga doesn’t go together?

Shri Mataji: Because I see people who do that, get sick, there is no science behind this,  you must know what for you stand, not blind ....

Interpreter: What is there after death, what about the life after death.

Interpreter: Do you think about it.

Shri Mataji: No

Interpreter:  What is the cause of lying, why do people lie?

Shri Mataji: Because they don’t know the truth.

Interpreter: What is the benefit of yoga, is yoga the power of thoughts.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. Beyond thinking you go, that will not be dangerous for you

Interpreter: You will learn about it later on.

Shri Mataji: You go beyond thinking.

Interpreter: How we go beyond thinking

Shri Mataji: With the Kundalini, it takes you there.

Interpreter: Is it the power which awakens, the Kundalini, is it the power of thinking

Shri Mataji: No, It is all pervading power, once you get your realization instead of talking this matter.

Interpreter: Could you explain the meaning of bindi?

Shri Mataji: It is in India, we put all married women, alright?

Interpreter: We heard that people wash your feet and drink the water from your feet and why the people bow in front of you?

Shri Mataji: All false.

Interpreter: Is this a sect?

Shri Mataji:... for what?

Interpreter: People bow on you, is this a sect?

Shri Mataji: Of course they bow on me, if the people wants to bow, what can I do?

Interpreter: How can people understand your value, your worth?

Shri Mataji: First you get your self-realization, you will know yourself then, you don’t yourself, how you can know me?

Interpreter: For what reason you started that mission

Shri Mataji: Don’t you think world is need peace?

Interpreter: The question is, the Sufis don’t have realization from the prophet, where you get your realization and do you see yourself as a prophet?

Shri Mataji: Don’t worry about me,

Interpreter: I believe in Yoga and I want to know that, I believe that in the country where the yoga is most needed now is Israel. What do you think about this?

Shri Mataji: You can’t help them, historically they are stupid.

Interpreter: She is inviting you to Ankara next year.

Shri Mataji: Very nice, thanks .....

Interpreter: What part affects the rise of Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: They have an effect, no doubt but we can worked out, but you don’t have to worry about past, we have to think about present.

Interpreter: we have some physical world problems and he is asking that it would be dangerous for them to keep Kundalini to rise, why there is this physical health problems. About cleaning the body, does he have to clean the body before the realization.

Shri Mataji: Not necessarily, but people do it, good.

Interpreter: He is asking if we can we self-realization?

Shri Mataji: Of course.

Interpreter: Just, there is one question,

Shri Mataji: What problem ....one has to have realization.

Interpreter: Every messenger has to face next goal, what do your next goal, do you see yourself as a prophet?

Shri Mataji: You don’t have to find out about me, you have to find out yourself

Interpreter: He is asking that do you think those Sufis had their Kundalini awaken

Shri Mataji: Most of them had.

Interpreter: and he says that most of them is not succeed to save the humans. They were tortured, how do you think you are going to succeed to save the humanity?

Shri Mataji: People are so bad and so cruelly, and they always torture the good people. What is humanity now.

Interpreter: What is the difference between Kundalini and Prana?

Shri Mataji: You get your realization you will know. Do you want your realization?

Interpreter: Do you want your self-realization?

Interpreter: Can we shut down these (air conditioners)

Shri Mataji: In Quran, Muhammed Sahap has said, at the time of resurrection, your hands will speak. This is the truth. If they don’t speak, something wrong.

Please close your eyes, there is no mesmerizing that is going on.

Don’t worry about me, worry about yourself.

Put the hands to me like you do in Namaz.

(Shri Mataji: blowing towards to microphone)

Now see, there is cool breeze, it could be also hot. Doesn’t matter, it will cool down.

Now put your right hand to top of your head, above the fontanelle bone area, ... cool breeze, see for yourself. There is a cool breeze coming out if you have. ......????

If it is hot, doesn’t matter, but it should be cool but after sometime it becomes cool. .......... You have to teach how to do it. There are many saints luckily here.

Again put your hands towards me, like this, like this.

All those who have felt the cool breeze on the fingertips or on their palms or out of head, rise your hands.

Interpreter: All of you.

Shri Mataji: You don’t have to pay anything, gradually you will learn everything on your fingertips. If you have any problems .....

Thank you very much, I love you very much.
