Public Program. Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey), 23 April 2002.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. I am very happy to see you all here to know about the truth.

What ever is told about your subtle being is not yet complete . Because in your awareness you don`t have yet that subtleness. That`s the last, the job awareness of collectivity. But human awareness you can’t understand. The final step, the common perception that being the collective you need Advancement.

I must tell you that in your country Turkey you have so many sufis in your country I should say . They call themselves the Sufis because they were clean and they are spiritually empowered. They talked of Ruh but nobody knew about Ruh and when they talked of Ruh they did not know how to explain – they talked of Ruhani life, but they could not explain what is ruhani life is. Ruhani is the life when you are connected with the all pervading power of Divine love. Is a different area which you enter. Because they could not explain they wrote everything beautifully, describing it. But now the time has come for you to get your Ruhani life. which is very important because you are not connected to the divine power whatever you may try, how so ever you will pray, how much you will read Kuran is not important.

Human life is connected with jealousy, with temper, with all kinds of malignant things. And we can see all over the world the problems are just spreading. Once they will get into the Ruhani life, they will realize that the whole world is one, there is a global exsistence. What happens that you jump into the sea, ocean of love, of pure love, no lust no greed, nothing. That’s has to happen because if we were born as human beings, we must get the ruhani life. For which you cannot pay, you cannot read it, you cannot understand it with your human awerness. So, you have to enter into a new dimension of your awareness.

Nobody understood the sufis, they just tortured them. Because they were so different, so much higher. Others could not bear it. And today, that is going on, people are fighting all over the world. So this is the life of pure love, but not forced, not taught, is just within you already, existing.
You do not know your worth, you do not know what you have. All the saints came here, incarnations came here, prophets came here nobody understood .They only killed them or tortured them. Because majority of the people were not Ruhani. So, all such ignorant people could not bear the knowledge, the divine knowledge of that supreme divine personalities .

Now the time has come for the whole world to become one and to jump into the sea of love. Which is very, very simple, it is very easy. As told to you we have already that power placed in the triangular bone of sacrum within us by our creator. Which is to be awakened. And once this power is awakened, it passes through the energy centers and clears them, enlightens them, and integrates them. And ultimately, this Kundalni connects you to the divine power. This is what is Miraj as described in the Qur’an. And all of you can get this miraj and once you get it you can experiment and get it on your finger tips. That is the proof. there is no false certificate about it. And ultimately, you can also get it out of your fontanelle bone area. This is the last bone which was pulsating when were a child, and then it closed. But when the Kundalini pierces here, then only you can feel the connection as cool breeze coming out from your own being. You have shown so much faith in God, so much faith in Kuran, so much faith in Islam but you have to surrender, Islam means to surrender and then you can achieve this awareness, this higher awareness of divinity within you. After getting these vibrations also you can develop a power to know what is wrong with you,with your chakras. and also you can make out what is wrong with others. That is how your awareness expands. Expands to the new dimension of Ruhani.

You all have to become Sufis. But now do not write poetry. Because people do not understand poetry. They misinterpret. I can also write poetry, but I don`t want. Because I want you to know directly the truth.

Now I must tell you one thing you have a country named France, among all the European countries they are the most idiotic people I have seen. Extremely pampered. Extremely dirty, they like smelling food and drinking so much. And they eat such smelling cheese so bad, I mean I do not know how , even the dogs do not eat them. And they talk about culture. They are so immoral. Benin is a country in South Africa and they all became Muslims. I asked them why did you become Muslims and not Christians like these? They said our rulers, they are horrible people so dirty, so filthy and so smelly. Many people and many writers such as Moliere who told about them, made fun of them. Written by another author, and showing them what is so strange, “Nana” another book who have showed how stupid they are. They have to learn from you. You are so different, you are so capable. I mean I must say you are so much sensible. But keep your sense, keep your inteligence. I am telling you about the French because nowadays they are trying to influence you. Also your television be careful. They do not know what is ruh is. God knows what kind of Christianity is that, just the opposite of Jesus. So please try to keep to your own culture and to your understanding. You can get your realisation in no time.

I came to Turkey, because if you remember Christ`s Mother, Mother of Jesus also came here. And I now know why she came here. Because people here are extremely good and so many sufis. It is such a joyful place. I think you all will get your realisation. Those who do not want they can go. This is a very simple thing.

In the meanwhile I would like to ask you all to ask some questions.
