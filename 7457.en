Public Program. Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey), 23 April 2002.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. I am very happy to see you all here to know about the Truth.

What ever is told about your subtle being is not yet complete. Because in your awareness you don’t have yet that subtleness. That’s the last step, the jump into your awareness of collectivity.

I must tell you that in this country, that is Turkey, you have so many Sufis. They called themselves Sufis because they were cleaned and they were spiritually empowered. They talked of Ruh but nobody knew about Ruh and when they talked of Ruh they did not know how to explain – they talked of Ruhani life, but they could not explain what is Ruhani life. Ruhani is the life when you are connected with the all-pervading power of Divine love. It is a different area into which you enter. Because they could not explain, they wrote everything beautifully, describing it. But now the time has come for you to get your Ruhani life. which is very important because if you are not connected to the divine power, whatever you may try, how so ever you will pray, how much you will read Kuran, it won’t help.

Human life is connected with jealousy, with temper, with all kinds of malignant things. And we can see all over the world the problems are just spreading. Once they will get into Ruhani life, they will realize that the whole world is one, there is a global existence. What happens is that you jump into the ocean of Love, of pure Love, no lust, no greed, nothing. That’s has to happen because if we are born as human beings, we must get Ruhani life, for which you cannot pay, you cannot read it, you cannot understand it with your human awareness. So, you have to enter into a new dimension of your awareness.

Nobody understood the Sufis and they just tortured them, because they were so different, so much higher. Others could not bear it. And today, that is going on, people are fighting all over the world. So this is the life of pure Love; but not forced, not taught, is just within you, already existing. You do not know your Love, you do not know what you have. All the saints came here, incarnations came here, prophets came here, nobody understood them.They only killed them because majority of the people were not Ruhani. So, all such ignorant people could not bear the knowledge, the divine knowledge of that great people.

Now the time has come for the whole world to become one and to jump into the sea of Love. Which is very, very simple, it is very easy. As I told you, we have already that power, placed in the triangular bone of sacrum within us by our Creator, which is to be awakened. And once it is awakened, it passes through the energy centers and clears them, enlightens them, and integrates them. And ultimately, this Kundalini connects you to the divine power. This is what is Miraj as described in the Qur’an. And all of you can get this Miraj and once you get it you can experiment and get it on your finger tips the cool breeze of the surrounding power of Love. That is the proof. There is no false certificate about it. And ultimately, you can also get it out of your fontanel bone area. This is the last bone which was pulsating as a child, and then it closed. But when the Kundalini pierces through that, then only you can feel the connection as cool breeze coming out from your own being. You have shown so much faith in God, so much faith in Kuran, so much faith in Islam, but you have to surrender, Islam means to surrender, and then you can achieve this awareness, this higher awareness of divinity within you. After getting these vibrations also, you can develop a power to know what is wrong within you, with your chakras. and also you can make out what is wrong with others. That is how your awareness expands,…expands to the new dimension of Ruhani.

You all have to become Sufis. But now do not write poetry, because people do not understand poetry. They misinterpret. I can also write poetry, but I don`t want because I want you to know directly the Truth.

Now I must tell you one thing: : you have a country called France;, among all the European countries, they are the most idiotic people I have seen. Extremely dirty, they like smelling food and drink all the time. And they eat such smelling cheese, even the dogs do not eat them. And they talk about culture. They are so immoral. Benin is a country in South Africa and they all became Muslims. I asked them: “why did you become Muslims and not Christians like these?”. They said our rulers, they are horrible people so dirty, so filthy and so smelly.

There is a writer called Molière who told about them, made fun of them. ‘And there is a beautiful novel, written by another writer, who have showed how stupid they are. They have to learn from you. You are so different, you are so capable. I mean I must say you are such a sensible, lovely people.; but keep to your sense, keep to your intelligence. I am telling you about the French because nowadays they are trying to influence you, also your television. Be careful. They do not know what Ruh is. God knows what sort of Christianity is that, just the opposite of Christ. So please try to keep to your own culture and to your understanding. And you can get your Realization in no time.

I came to Turkey, because if you remember Christ`s Mother also came here. And I now know why she came here; because the people here are extremely good and so many Sufis. It is such a joyful place. I think you all will get your Realization. Those who do not want can go. This is a very simple thing.

In the meanwhile, I would like to ask you all to ask some questions.
