聯合國第四屆世界婦女大會  區際圓桌會議
北京亞運村商品交易樓會議廰  1995年9月13日

主持人:親愛的母親 Shrivastava(錫呂·瑪塔吉 丈夫名為 C.P. Shrivastava),

是一位靈性母親以及霎哈嘉瑜伽的領袖。霎哈嘉——霎哈嘉·瑜伽,我非常期待聽到您有關霎哈嘉瑜伽的發言,因為我相信您對全世界很多婦女都有這種心願,所以今天我期待著您打動人心的發言。

錫呂·瑪塔吉:

全世界的兄弟姐妹們:

我感到十分榮幸,能在此著名的會議上談論世界性的婦女問題。首先我們的主辦國-中華人民共和國的政府和人民。我曾有幸訪問中國兩次,我十分欣賞這個偉大國家的智慧和文化。

在這世界歷史上最輝煌的時刻,我們如此深刻地意識到婦女的問題,這一點超出了我的想像。整體而言,婦女在過去的年代受了不少苦,正如之前演講的女士告訴你們的,因為我們還未意識到婦女的重要性,以及她們在人類社會中的應有角色。社會本身作為女性的創造物,卻試圖控制和貶低婦女。在東方,可以說由於受到原教旨主義的影響,婦女承受著極大的壓力,她們的道德水準是基於恐懼而非自由。在西方她們為自由而戰,卻得到虛假的自由。西方的婦女有拋棄一切社會和道德價值觀的自由。而在東方,可以說大部分的女性都十分膽小,她們受到壓制,無法去表現自己。而在西方,我們發現大部分婦女都淪為性感的象徵。她們熱衷於暴露自己的身體,渴望出現在時尚廣告中,獲得非常低俗的名氣。大部分婦女都接受這種狀況,否則她們就不能在這紛亂的西方世界中生存。大部分東方婦女認為十分丟臉和有辱人格的事,在西方卻被視為無上光榮。東西方的情況我都已看得很透徹,我想,除非出現新的文化,才能使東方和西方的婦女都能提升自身的尊嚴,為所處的社會創造更高的道德標準,以此來表現女性自身。否則,無論東方或是西方的婦女,都不能充分彰顯她們的女性特質。這個特質是:假如婦女因其女性身份而得到尊重,瞭解她們的才幹,以及她們如何通過所需的教育增強自身的能力,她們便會得到所有的安全感,並會把這種安全感帶給社會。

所有談論宗教的原教旨主義者,期望女性要絕對地有道德,而男士卻可以為所欲為,我想相對於女性,我們更應多點男性教育,因為戰爭的想法開始也只是源于男人。為發展中國家的貧困婦女籌集金錢,並幫助她們脫離貧困,我要承認這些事做起來並不困難。但不幸的是,據就我所知,我們所籌集的金錢,可能不會到達貧困婦女的手中,而最終可能會落入那些貪污的部長、官員和其他負責人員的口袋裡,最終將會被存入瑞士銀行。我並不想批評任何聯合國組織,因為我知道他們非常誠實地對待聯合國的宗旨,但他們必須瞭解背地裡發生的事情。在印度我們有兩個很大的邦,北方邦和比哈爾邦邦,都接受過聯合國兒童基金會和世界衛生組織的大力幫助。聯合國兒童基金會開設一個叫 Angan 的專案,Angan即庭院的意思,在那裡兒童可以接受教育,被培養成才。這個項目對孩子們來說沒起到什麼作用,但所有的錢都進了負責這個項目的腐敗分子的口袋裡,應該給孩子的錢,孩子們連百分之二也得不到。世界衛生組織也有同樣的事發生,他們向印度贈送藥物及儀器,那些(贈送的)藥物在市場上出售,並且完全被接收者用來牟取私利。世界衛生組織的醫療儀器也是同樣的情況。所以那些貧窮的人從沒得到什麼好處,他們依然是終日無助。所有這些贓款流進了乾淨的瑞士銀行。世界銀行給發展中國家的大部分貸款都被轉入腐敗官員在瑞士銀行的私人帳戶裡。故此所有這些發展中國家都欠下了世界銀行的債務,但仍然是不名一文,這些錢都到瑞士銀行裡去了。因此我想懇請各位與瑞士銀行交涉,要求他們歸還所有被腐敗官員轉入瑞士銀行的贓款,並把這些款項交回給聯合國,這樣聯合國可以將此款項用於婦女教育,和其他那些同樣需要我們保持警覺、實際有效的惠及當事人的項目。要組織好人們,尤其是那些參與其中的,誠實的、有愛心的,而且會好好利用這些款項的婦女們,以幫助要實現社會平等的女性。婦女的主要工作是創造一個能更好地享受和平的美好社會。

不道德的貪污和暴力是兩個可怕的怪物,正在吞噬我們的社會,我要責備那些貪污者和不道德者的母親,因為她們在子女年幼時沒有履行好母親的責任。母親的愛心訓練對於把孩子塑造成美麗公民具有首要的影響且最為有效。作為母親從沒試過用心去關愛引導孩子,作為妻子或是女兒,陷入對男性或對這種毀滅性文化的恐懼中,沒有盡到作為家庭不可或缺的成員的責任,去強化男性的道德品格。看到這一點也很重要,在東西方兩種文化裡 孩子們是如何被對待的。在東方文化中我們看到的是,若孩子們沒有受到原教旨主義文化的影響,他們會聽從母親的話。這種(原教旨主義)文化使女性低人一等,只能受制於男性和自己的孩子。在西方也有同樣的事情發生,孩子既不尊重他們的母親 更不聽從她們的話。我覺得這是因為,總體來說,西方女性用於護理身體和容貌的時間,比照顧關愛孩子的時間更多。母親和孩子之間的聯繫在減弱,甚至割裂。從而正是由於這個原因,很多孩子成為街頭頑童,崇尚暴力。幸而在東方有許多家庭,在西方也有一些家庭,極力反抗當今社會的腐敗影響,悉心照顧他們的孩子,妥善培養他們成人。

但我仍然要說,東方孩子並沒有像西方孩子那麼嚴重地被摧毀。也是因為東方的很多人,沒有接受原教旨主義文化或是西方文化,且擁有很好的社會環境培養非常優秀的孩子,儘管他們為數不多。但不管他們長期以來在傳統上繼承了何種文化,這些文化在他們內在都已根深蒂固,對他們來說道德價值觀是最高的,高於金錢和權力。

現在的西方充滿問題。雖然他們富有,但他們內在沒有平安。真相是,婦女是每種文明和每個國家的潛在力量。很明顯,婦女是整個人類的創造者和保護者。這是全能的神賦予並分配給她們的角色。種子自身不能創造些什麼,是母親大地賜予花朵、果實及其他饋贈。同樣,是婦女生育孩子,養育嬰兒,並最終培養他們成為未來的公民。因此婦女應與大地母親齊名,是整個人類的居所。不幸的是,男性用體力獲得支配女性的地位。他們沒意識到在人類的奮鬥歷程當中,女性與男性是互補而平等的夥伴,但兩者並不相同。一個社會假如沒有認識到這一基本真理,沒有賦予女性應有的社會地位,就是一個不文明的社會。在我的國家有句這樣的梵文:"yatra narya pujyante tatra ramante devata",意思是:“哪裡有婦女受到尊重和值得尊重,哪裡就有幸福女神留駐。”

所以我們此刻要明白造物主賜予我們這種偉大力量的價值。但我們發現了什麼呢?無論在東方或是西方,婦女都沒有充分地彰顯出她們的偉大之處。在此,我並不是說女性在人類社會中唯一的角色是作為母親,生產及養育兒童,或作為妻子,或作為姐妹。婦女完全有權利作為平等的夥伴參與到生活的各個方面,無論是在社會、文化、教育、政治、經濟、行政,以及其他方面。為了讓自己為這個全方位角色做好準備,婦女必須享有在各種知識領域接受教育的權利。但如果她們身為母親,她們便要肩負起對自己的子女的重大責任,如同她們對整個社會的責任那樣。男性對國家的政治和經濟要負責,而女性要對社會負責。女性可以扶持男性,當然也可以在任何職位上擔當領導角色。但十分重要的是,女性不應忘記她們是女性,要展現出母性的深情關愛,若她們變得男性化,而且爭強好勝,這樣整個社會便不能保持平衡。

同時,我要提出當我們要求女性權利時,也要強調女性在人類社會中的基本責任,西方女性或接受過西方教育的女性,以及我所見過的一些其他女性,她們在扮演政治、經濟或行政的角色時走向另一極端。為了與男性競爭,她們變得太過自以為是、自我中心、野心勃勃。她們失去了令人舒緩愉悅,能給人們帶來平安和平衡的特質。相反,她們成為獨裁專橫、尋歡作樂的人,她們更在乎自己外表的吸引力,而非擁有令人愉快 甜美和尊貴的特質。有意無意地,她們會比男性更快地屈服於卑鄙的自我。這一切導致了社會混亂,孩子長大成為街頭的頑童,準備著爭鬥。我們需要在兩個極端之間取得平衡。我們需要婦女作為男性的平等夥伴,而並非和男性相同的夥伴。但她們要精微地理解男性的特質,懂得如何運用內在的平衡使男性到達中正平衡的狀態。我們需要平衡的婦女,這樣全人類才能到達內在平安的平衡狀態。你們可能說所有這些想法都不錯,但如何達致這平衡的狀態呢?我們如何遏止這病態的、腐化的、不道德的、未成年化又暴力的浪潮呢?我們如何結束現在的衝突和混亂狀態?我們如何把平安帶入每個人的心靈?      請讓我謙虛的說:這些問題都有一個答案。這是一個新的方法...

錫呂•瑪塔吉問主持人:你想要我告訴他們這個新方法嗎?

主持人:他們在等著。告訴他們吧!......(錫呂·瑪塔吉說:超時了)主持人:您有3分鐘。

無論我正在向你們說什麼,都不要看作是理所當然的。你們應該有像科學家那樣開放的思想,把我向你們所說的內容看成是一個假設,若這個假設得到證實,那麼作為誠實的人,你便應接受這是絕對真理。因為這是為了你的好處,為了你家人的好處,為了你的國家的好處,也是為了整個世界的好處。

我在這裡告訴你們人類進化的最後一個突破。我們意識進化的這一突破,必須要在當今這個時代發生,並且已被記錄在許多先知的著作裡。這個時代被稱為“墮落時代”,寫下《薄伽梵歌》的偉大聖人蟻蛭仙人(Vyasa)最後一次提到了“墮落時代”。我們現在隨處可見人類的墮落。除非我們有所改善,否則戰爭無法避免。

現在我想說些有關我們內在的神秘知識,這知識在印度數千年前已為人所知。為了我們的進化及靈性上的升進,我們內裡有個剩餘的力量,位於我們脊柱底部的三角骨內,這個剩餘的力量被稱為靈量(Kundalini)。儘管有關這個力量的知識在數千年前的印度就已存在,但靈量的喚醒,歷來只能是一對一地進行,一個導師只能喚醒一個門徒的靈量。當靈量被喚醒後,發生的結果是:你們獲得自覺,到達真我的狀態。其次,當這個力量被喚醒後,她上升並穿越我們體內六個精微能量中心,滋養並且整合這些能量中心。最後這個力量會穿越頭蓋骨上那個我們稱為腦囟或梵穴的地方,把你和上天無所不在的浩愛力量連接起來。這個力量在《聖經》中被稱為 聖靈的涼風,在古蘭經被稱為“魯哈”(Ruh),在印度的經典中被稱為生命能量(Paramchaitanya),帕坦迦利稱之為改變季節的力量(Ritambhara Pragya)。無論是什麼名稱,這個力量是無所不在的,這力量造就進化過程中所有關乎生命的精微工作。這個無所不在的力量在人類未得自覺前不能被覺知到。但在得自覺後你便可以在指尖上、手掌心或頭頂上感應到。

此外 這個過程是自然發生的,是“霎哈嘉(Sahaja)”。“霎哈(Saha)”的意思是“同在”,“嘉(ja)”的意思是“出生”。意思是獲得與上天無所不在的浩愛力量的聯合,是每個人與生俱來的權利。我們思維的能量是有限的,我們有限的思維能量呈線性運動,不能支撐實相,到達一處便停止下來,然後像回力鏢般飛回。所有這些思維上的線性運動都會飛回來,有時會成為對我們自身的懲罰。因此,所以現在我們需要更多、更高、更深層的能量。為此,如果我們不想有另一場戰爭,就應當讓人們獲得自覺。

我要說,在西方我遇見很多真理的真正追求者,他們厭倦了西方那種人工化的生活。有時他們不知道要追求什麼,還犯了很多錯。他們到那些收取高額金錢的假導師那裡去,因此破產,造成身心殘缺。有一件事情你們必須注意,靈量的覺醒從而獲得自覺是進化過程中一個活生生的過程,我們不能用金錢購買。就像把種子放在母親大地裡,它會發芽,因為母親大地有力量令種子發芽。這表明我們同樣也有發芽的力量,在三角骨(即希臘人稱為聖骨的裡面),有一個捲曲成三圈半的能量。這表明希臘人知道這是塊神聖的骨頭,因此稱之為聖骨。事實上在一些人身上,你可以看到這個三角骨在跳動,並且靈量在慢慢上升。現在已經有許多人獲得了自覺,現在霎哈嘉瑜伽已經進入了85個國家;這些國家都變化很大,彼此間和平共處。在這些自覺者心中,他們就是一個整體,他們變得極富愛心和慈悲心

時間到了 抱歉我不能告知你們更多。我希望你們不要介意,非常感謝!

主持人:非常感謝 我很抱歉您只能匆匆講完這個方法。這裡有她的發言稿影本可供我們分享,我想這個發言的美妙之處在於她給了一個我們所有人都能運用的獲得自覺的方法,從而我們也可以成為愛好和平的人,與他人有和諧的關係。這是我從您的發言中瞭解到的。但願我的資訊是正確的

錫呂•瑪塔吉:非常感謝!

主持人:好,非常感謝!

Note: Shri Mataji had prepared a longer talk to be delivered at the conference. However, due to time constraints, She was not able to read the entire talk. The following is a transcript of the prepared talk.

Brothers and Sisters of the World,

It is a great honor for Me to talk about global problems of women in front of this distinguished assembly. First of all I would like to offer My profound gratitude to the government and people of our host country, the People’s Republic of China. I have had the privilege of visiting China on two previous occasions and I am a great admirer of the wisdom and culture of this great nation that I have visited.

This is, beyond My imagination, the most glorious time in the history of the world that at this time we are so much aware of the problems of women. Women as a whole have definitely suffered over the ages as the previous lady has told you because we have not realized what their importance is and what their proper role is in human society. Society itself, which is her creation, tries to control or put down the womanhood. In the East, we can say, that due to fundamentalist influence women have been under great pressure and their morality is based on fear rather than freedom. In the West they have fought for their freedom, but what they have attained is spurious freedom. The women in the West have freedom to abandon all social and moral values. Thus in the East, we can say, that most of the women are timid, oppressed and cannot express themselves, while in the West we find most of the women are reduced to a sex symbol. They are keen to expose their body. Their anxiety is to appear in fashion advertisements and very cheap popularity. Most of them accepted this position because otherwise they could not have survived in that chaotic world of the West.

What most of the women in the East would regard as very humiliating and degrading is regarded as something very glorifying in the West. I have seen both the worlds very deeply and I feel that unless and until you bring a new culture by which women from the East and West can both rise in their own esteem and express themselves in such a way that they create high moral standards for their society, women neither in the East nor in the West will rise to their full stature of feminine speciality. The speciality is that if women are respected for their womanhood, understanding what they are capable of and how they can empower themselves with all the education needed, all the security will be provided to them and they will provide security to the society.

All the fundamentalists who talk of religion expect women to be absolutely moral and the men can do whatever they like. I feel we have to educate men more than women, because the idea of war comes only from the men. I must admit it is not difficult to collect money for poor women in the developing countries and help them to get out of their poverty, but unfortunately, my knowledge is that the money we are collecting may not reach the poor women but may end up into the pockets of the corrupt ministers, bureaucrats and other people in charge and ultimately will end up in the Swiss Bank.

I do not want to criticize any UN organization because I know they are very honest in their purpose, but they must be made aware of what is happening under the table. We in India have two very big states called as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are very much helped by UNICEF as well as the World Health Organization. UNICEF started a project called Angan, meaning Courtyard, where the children were to be educated and brought up in a proper shape. This project is not at all working for the children but all the money goes into the pockets of all the corrupt people who are in charge of that project and the children do not get even two percent of what is being sent for them. Same with the World Health Organization, which is sending medicines and equipment to India. These medicines are sold in the market and are completely used by the recipients for their own gains. The same happens to W.H.O. equipment. So the poor people never get any benefit and they remain all the time helpless.

One has to have a very good network of people, especially women, who are involved and who are honest, compassionate and who would like to make the best out of this money, helping the women to achieve social equality. The main work of womanhood is to create a good society.

Immorality and corruption are the two horrible monsters which are eating up our society. I would blame the mothers of these immoral and corrupt persons because they failed in their duty as mothers in their childhood. The loving training of the mother is the first and most effective influence in shaping the children into beautiful citizens. Mothers who have never tried to guide with great concern and love, or the wives or the daughters who are falling into the fear of the men or of the destructive culture, have not done their duty as integral members of the family to strengthen the moral fiber of the men. It is important also to see how children are treated in these two cultures of East and West. What we see in the East is that children would listen to their mothers if they are not under fundamentalist culture. This culture relegates women to the level of an inferior human being, fit to be dominated by men and children. In the West also the same thing happens. Children don’t respect their mothers neither do they listen to them. I feel this is because, generally, the Western women spend more time looking after their body and looks than on looking after and loving their children. The nexus between the mother and children weakens and breaks. It is for this reason that many children become street urchins. Fortunately there are still many families in the East and some in the West who deeply defy the corrupting trends of today and look after their children and bring them up properly.

But still I must say that the children in the East are not that much ruined as they are in the West. The reason, also, is that in the East there are many people who have not taken to fundamentalist culture or to the Western culture and have a very good society and produce children who are exceptionally good although this number may not be very great. But whatever culture they have inherited, since long, traditionally, is very much ingrained in them and to them the moral value system is the highest, more than money or power.

The West is now full of problems. Though they have money, they don’t have peace within and without. The truth is that women are the potential power of every civilization and every country. It is evident that women are the creators and the preservers of the entire humankind. This is the role that the almighty God has assigned to them. Seeds cannot create anything by themselves. It is the Mother Earth which provides the flowers and the fruits and other bounties. Similarly, it is the woman who creates the child, who nurtures the baby and eventually brings up the citizen of tomorrow. Women must therefore rank with Mother Earth as the edifice of the entire humanity. Unfortunately, men have utilized muscle power to gain a dominating position over women. They have not recognized that women are complementary and equal but not similar partners in human endeavors. A society that does recognize this fundamental truth and does not given to women their rightful role is not a civilized society.

In my own country there is a saying in Sanskrit, “Yatra nayra pujyante tatra ramante devata”, which means that “Where the women are respected and respectable, there resides the Gods of our well-being”. So it is for us, at this moment, to recognize the value of this great power that is given to us by our Creator. But what do we find? Whether in the East or in the West, women have not been able to give a full manifestation of their greatness. I am not suggesting at all that the only role of women in society is that of the Mother, the pro-creator and preserver of children, or that of a wife, or a sister. Women have a full right to participate as equal partners in every aspect of life – social, cultural, educational, political, economical, administrative and the rest. In order to prepare themselves for this all-pervading role, they must have the right to education in all branches of knowledge. But if they are mothers, they have a great responsibility towards their children as well as their society. Men are responsible for the politics and economics of the country but women are responsible for the society. Women can also support men and they can take a leading part, of course, in any position but, it is very important that they should not forget that they are women who have to manifest deep motherly concern and love. If they become manly and aggressive the balance of society cannot be maintained.

At the same time I must submit that, while we ask for the rights of women, we must also stress the fundamental duties of women to the human society. The women in the West, or those who are educated in the West, have gone to the other extreme when they are taking to political, economical or administrative roles. To compete with men they have become much too self-willed, self-centered and ambitious. They have no more their soothing and pleasing qualities which can keep the balance. On the contrary, they become dominating, pleasure-seeking individuals. They are far more worried about their physical attractions than having a pleasing, sweet and dignified personality. They give into their baser self much faster than men, wittingly or unwittingly. All this leads to chaotic societies and children grow up into street urchins, thieves and even murderers, as we read everyday in the paper.

What we need is a balance between the two extremes. We need women as equal but not similar partners with men, but with a subtle understanding of the nature of men and how to bring them into the center with inner balance. We need balanced women in order to have a balanced human race with peace within itself. You might say all this is excellent in thought, but how do we achieve this state of balance? How do we stem the tide of diseases, corruption, immorality and immaturity? How do we end the present state of conflict and confusion? How do we bring about peace within every mind and heart? I very humbly submit that there is an answer to these questions. There is a new way...

Whatever I am going to tell you now is not be taken for granted. You should, of course, have your minds open like scientists and treat whatever I am stating as a hypothesis. If this hypothesis can be proved, then you have to accept it as honest persons as the absolute truth because it is for your benevolence. It is for the benevolence of your family. It is for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

I am here to tell you about the last breakthrough of our evolution. This breakthrough of our evolution in our awareness has to happen in these modern times and has been, moreover, recorded in the writings of many seers. These are the times called as the “Decadent Times”, last called by the great saint Vyasa who has written the Gita, and it is the decadence of humanity that we see around in every way possible.

Now I would like to tell the secret knowledge of our inner being which was known in India thousands of years back. For our evolution and spiritual ascent there is a residual power within us which is located in the triangular bone at the base of our spine. This residual power is known as Kundalini. Though the knowledge of this power was available thousands of years back in India, the awakening of the Kundalini was done, traditionally, on an individual basis only. One guru would give awakening to one disciple. As a result of that awakening, what happens is that you achieve your Self-Realization, your Self-hood. Secondly, when this power is awakened, it rises and passes through six subtle energy centers in your body, nourishing them and integrating them. Ultimately, this power breaks through the fontanel bone area called as the Taloo or the Brahmarandra and connects you to the all-pervading power of Divine love, which is described in the bible also as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost also in the Koran as Ruh and also in the Indian scriptures as Paramchaitanya. Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara PrAgnya.

Whatever the name, this is a power which is all-pervading, which does all the subtle works of living process, of evolutionary process. The existence of this all-pervading energy is not felt before Realization but after Self-Realization you can feel it on your fingertips or at the center of your palm or above the fontanel bone area.

Moreover, this process has to be spontaneous, Sahaja. Saha means with and ja means born. That means the right to get this union with the all-pervading power of Divine love is the birthright of every human being. Our mental energies are limited. Our limited mental energy, which is linear in movement and has not sustenance of reality, reaches a point and stops. From there it boomerangs and all that mental, linear movement comes back to us as a punishment sometimes. So now we need more energy, higher energy, deeper energy and for that this happening has to take place.

I must say that in the West, I have met many people who are true Seekers of Truth and are fed up of artificiality of the Western life. Also they didn’t know what they were seeking sometimes and they have made lots of mistakes. They have gone to false gurus who have taken lots of money and the people have become bankrupts and mentally and physically handicapped.

The one thing you must note is that the awakening of the Kundalini and thus achieving Self-Realization is a living process of evolution for which we cannot pay anything. It is like putting a seed in the Mother Earth. It sprouts because Mother Earth has the power to sprout it and the seed has an in-built germinating quality within it. In the same way we have this germinating power in the triangular bone which Greeks called as Sacrum. Actually in some people you can see this triangular bone pulsating and the Kundalini very slowly rising, but where there are no obstructions and if the person is a balanced being, the Kundalini rises from the Sacrum just like a jet and passes through the fontanel bone area to become one with the all-pervading power. This Kundalini is the spiritual mother of every individual and She knows or has recorded all the past aspirations of Her child. She is anxious to give second birth to Her child and, during Her ascent, She nourishes six energy centers.

When a person is not connected to the all pervading power, he is like an instrument which is not connected to the mains and has no identity, has no meaning, has no purpose. As soon as it is connected, all that is built in inside this instrument starts working and manifesting itself. When this Kundalini rises it connects you to the all pervading power, which is vital and which is an ocean of knowledge as well as an ocean of bliss. After the awakening of Kundalini, you experience many coincidences which are miraculous and extremely blissful. Above all Kundalini is the ocean of forgiveness. So what ever mistakes you have committed in the past are forgiven and instead you get your self-realization as a blessing.

The consequences of the awakening of the Kundalini and thereby the attainment of Self-Realization are numerous. First and foremost, such a person is constantly in contact with or is in fact a part of the all pervading Divine power. He seeks the truth by using his new awareness. And truth is one. All self-realized persons see this same truth. Thus conflicts are avoided. Purely mental activity without Self-Realization, leads to conflicting ideas and even wars. All this is avoided after Self-Realization.

Now, let us see how many other things happen in a person who gets realization. Firstly you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on your fingertips, which represent the subtle energy centers. Thus you know the truth on your fingertips. You transcend all the limitations of race, religion and other ideas and you go beyond your mind to see and feel the reality and understand it.

he next thing that happens is that you become thoughtlessly aware. We live in the future and the past through our thoughts. They come to us from these two areas of time but we cannot be in the present. While these thoughts are rising and falling we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts. But when Kundalini rises She elongates these thoughts and thereby creates some space in-between, which is the present, which is the reality. So the past is over and the future doesn’t exist. At that time you have no thoughts. You reach a new state as you become thoughtlessly aware about which Jung has written clearly. At this moment whatsoever happens is recorded in your memory well and you enjoy every moment of this in reality. When you become thoughtlessly aware then you become completely peaceful within yourself.

A person who has achieved this peace also emits peace and creates a peaceful atmosphere around himself. This peace is very important. Unless and until we have this peace we will never truly understand whatever our ideas are, whether universal or just limited. You can feel your own seven centers on your fingertips. Also you can feel the centers of others because you develop a new level of awareness which is called as Collective Consciousness. When such new awareness is established into you, you start feeling also the centers of others. I must tell you that these centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing and when they are affected or they are in jeopardy, people suffer from one disease or another. As a result of the awakening of the Kundalini and the nourishment of these centers, an important development would be that you will feel an inner balance and you will enjoy good health. Many diseases, even some incurable ones, have been cured by the awakening of the Kundalini. Even the database of the inherited genes may be restructured after self-realization through the awakening of the Kundalini. As a result, a person who might have inherited genes indicating criminal tendency might become a good man.

Our attention also becomes very pure. In the light of the spirit we can see things much more clearly than when we were blind. For example, a person who goes with his blind eyes and feels an elephant and then another comes in and a third comes in – all of them have different ideas about the elephant, depending on whichever part of the elephant they have touched. But if they open their eyes then they can all see the same thing, the reality, and there will be no quarrel and fights.

A self-realized person can feel the absolute knowledge on the fingertips. Supposing someone doesn’t believe in God. A self-realized person can suggest to the non-believer that he should ask the question: “Is there God?” The questioner will get, you will find, a very nice cool breeze coming into his being. He may not believe in God but there is God.

Unfortunately, so many of those who believe in God are also absurd, hypocritical, cruel, weird and so immoral that people have lost faith in God. But while those who represent God may be wrong, God himself exists and his power also exists which we call as the all-pervading power of Divine love. This is the power of love and compassion and not of aggression and destruction when it is imbibed in a yogi or in a self-realized person, it works in a very different way, like an angel. Such people can cure others and cure themselves. Even mental cases have been cured. Not only that. Even those who have been to wrong gurus in their search of truth have achieved their spiritual stability, after leaving the false gurus and coming to the path of self-realization.

In the next stage, you become thoughtlessly aware, when your Kundalini is stabilized and you know undoubtedly that you have achieved your self-realization, that you have attained all the powers that can be utilized. You become very powerful because you can raise the Kundalini of others. You become very active and you don’t feel tired easily. For example, I am seventy three years of age and I am traveling about every third day, but I am quite all right. This energy flows into you and fills you up with vitality. You become extremely dynamic and at the same time extremely compassionate, kind and mild. You feel that you are protected and thus you are confident but not egotistical. Your whole personality changes. This is the kind of global transformation which is taking place with such a speed all over that I, myself, am surprised at how it is working out so fast.

Actually, this knowledge existed a long time back but my contribution, if there is any, is that we can now achieve en-masse realization. Thousands can achieve mass realization. It is a gift of this time where it was predicted that such a global transformation will take place. In as many as 65 countries, thousands of people have attained their Self-Realization through Sahaja Yoga.

The power of Kundalini is the pure desire of attaining your self-hood. If someone doesn’t want to have it, you cannot force him because the Divine respects the freedom of that person. If he wants to go to heaven, he can go there, or if he wants to go to hell, he can go to hell. Self-realization can be attained easily if the people have a sincere and pure desire to get their self-realization. But if they stick to some of their ideas, which are fixed, the Kundalini won’t rise. Also it cannot work for idiots or for immature people. It works for people who are wise, who are more in the center, and it works very fast. I was amazed to see that it has worked even on people who were drug addicts, who were alcoholics and who were very immoral. But they all had an intense and pure desire to secure self-improvement, self-realization. So many of such people achieved their goal of self-realization. Overnight, they gave up their drugs, their alcoholism . Thus you become very powerful and at the same time you understand that you are now glorified and you start behaving in a very dignified and a very sensible manner. This is how a new culture is born and this new culture takes you, in a way, into a new style of life where you become innately, I say innately, righteous. Nobody has to tell you: “Don’t do this” and “Don’t do that”. It is all achieved through your enlightened attention. This enlightened attention is also full of power. Wherever you put your attention it works, it creates peace, it creates harmony and also it creates a new dimension of collective consciousness.

So to blame your genes for your mistakes is not going to work out anymore because these genes can be changes in their database and can be brough to the level of a very righteous, angelic personality. The ego and the conditioning of a person gets dissolves by the ascent of the Kundalini and he becomes really a free bird. Absolute freedom is achieved in reality and his behaviour changes tremendously with great faith in himself. He becomes a witness of the whole drama of life. When you are in the water you are afraid of getting drowned, but supposing you get into a boat, you can watch the same waters with enjoyment. But if you learn how to jump in the water and save others then it is even a higher situation and so we have a higher awareness which we call as doubtless awareness. Above all, we fall into the ocean of joy. Joy is absolute. It doesn’t have duality. It is not like happiness and unhappiness. It is a singular thing and once you jump into it you learn easily how to enjoy everything, whether it is beautiful or ridiculous. In one case you see the beauty; in the other you see the humour as to how people are ridiculous. The remarkable thing is that Sahaja Yogis have become great musicians, great writers, great speakers, great administrators. In every way they have risen very high, specially in their attitude towards others. They respect everyone and they know what is wrong with other people so that this person who has these problems can be easily evolved and become a self-realised soul. It is like one candle lighting another candle. This work is going on all over the world and there is great hope that it will also start in China. Before this, somehow, I could not start my work but the Divine coincidence has given a chance to me by this conference to talk to Chinese people, whom I find very wise and sensitive, about the great treasure of spirituality. This is not a coincidence. It was inevitable and has been brought about by this all-pervading power. In your life also you will notice lots of coincidences but you will not know how to connect them to something that is Divine unless and until you get connected to like Divine power.

Confucius has taught the humanity how we can improve our relations with other human beings. But Lao Tse in Chine has very beautifully described TAO, meaning the Kundalini. And I have had a voyage through the Yangtze River through which Lao Tse had gone many times. I know he was trying to show that river, which is the Kundalini, is flowing towards the sea and one should not be tempted by the nature that is around. The nature around the Yangtze River is very, very beautiful, no doubt, but one has to go through the river. Also there are lots of currents which flow and can be quite dangerous and we need a good navigator who should take his ship across to the point where it is nearer the sea. At that stage it becomes very silent and extremely simple in its flow.

This country has been endowed with great philosophers, I would say the greatest was Lao Tse, because humanism was for the preparation of human beings for their ascent about which Lao Tse had spoken. But because of the subtle subject it was not described in such a clear-cut manner as I am talking to you. It is such a pleasure for me to talk to this august gathering here. After traveling all over the world, I realize that China is one of the best countries as far as spirituality is concerned.

May the Divine bless you all.
