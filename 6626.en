Seminar in Old Arlesford (England), 17 May 1980.

You must know that Sahaja Yoga is a living process, it is the same type of a process by which a seed sprouts into a tree. It is a living process. So it is God's job, He has to do it, it is not your job: to sprout the seed is His job.
But the problem comes in because at this stage where human being is the seed, he has freedom. They have freedom. With that freedom they can spoil His manifestation, His work. So the first thing one has to remember that we must have wisdom about it. The first point of wisdom, in fact, that it is God Almighty who is going to do this job. You are not doing it. You cannot sprout the seed. Then how can you sprout your seed also? And in that wisdom we must learn one thing and know within ourselves that you are part and parcel of the whole process. Though you have your own freedom, freedom also is a part and parcel of the same process. You are not separated from God. You do not have any separated entity. You are part and parcel of that whole process.  All right? 

So to think that you have to decide something about it is also wrong. You are in the same machinery, brought to this stage when you are given freedom, for your further evolution. So at this stage when you have your freedom, you must know that freedom wants to be given to you, to understand the value of freedom. And in that freedom, you must understand what is glorious for you. Once you understand that, then you tell yourself that, “Now, you see, I have to become something more. That’s why God has done this. The only thing I have to do is to completely coordinate, cooperate and surrender to His will, so that I become.” This is the first preparation we have to make. In that surrendering, you will do the greatest thing because by that, you do not interfere with His work.


Unless and until you surrender you cannot have the wisdom. So first of all you understand this, through your little wisdom that you have, and then you will have the full wisdom. First of all, understand this with the little wisdom that you have, that without surrendering you will be obstructing the way of God. He knows what is good for you. He wants to give you the highest which you cannot achieve yourself. He’s going to give you the highest. If you want to achieve it, you cannot achieve it. It is His doing. It is His dhan, as you call it, His gift to you. In that case you must know the best way to achieve it is to allow His working to work out. 


Now when you think of surrendering, first of all the brain wave starts working. “What do I surrender?” You think by surrendering, say, your material wealth. That’s not what He wants. It’s all wealth He has given to you. What do you want to do? It’s equal to even dust particle off His feet. So that one is not going to help. Sometimes you may feel that, “I should give my intelligence,” or that is what is asked. Nobody wants to have your idiots and stupid people. So you don’t give up your [unclear.]/[hearing things yourself?] Then some people think that, “l give up my heart.”  All right, some people say. We don’t want heartless people either. Then some people will say that, ‘’Mother, we‘ll give up our, what you call, the relationships with others.” That also is not needed, because your heart should be there where it is. The light has to come in your heart. What can you give your heart to whom, when the one who has given you the heart, what’s the use of giving Him back the heart? Isn’t it? The One who has given you intelligence, what’s the use of giving Him?


Something that you have achieved yourself has to be given. What have you achieved, is your ego and your super-ego . What you have achieved is nothing but your ego, and this ego you have to give up, which is a difficult task. Ego, if it comes, say, out of money, material things, it is better you give up some material things, not to God but somebody else; it’s better. If the material things are creating that ego, if your intelligence is creating ego that you think you have a very high IQ, is better to bring it down a little. It is for you to judge. Watch yourself in what makes your ego bloated. If you could start looking at your ego you will be amazed, that any useless thing can bloat it and can also deflate it. It can get hurt from nothing at all. It becomes so important. 


Then the superego part of it also goes. That is also what you have to give, and in superego you can have your conditionings due to your gurus and wrong types of doings and wrong types of conditionings you have had from childhood, like, for example, somebody is a Catholic, you see. For him, Pope is everything. Or somebody is a Hindu. For him a particular temple is everything.


All these are conditionings. Why they are conditioning that without finding out the truth about them, you have just accepted them as it is. This is the simple thing. So if you can find out the truth about all these things, you will give it up. You may; you may not. There are many people who know the truth. Still they do not give up. You see, human beings are complicated stuff. Even if they know the truth they will not give up. But supposing you try to find the truth about all these things, then you may give; you may not give. But going back into the whole thing, to find out each and everything, make a schedule of the whole thing that, ‘’Morning time I’ll find out about this, and evening time about this,” all your life you will go on finding one by one, and ultimately you will find that you have gone now up to the grave. So that procedure also is not going to help you.


By God’s grace you are realized souls and you can find out in a second whether you are on the conditioning side or not. If your left is catching you are conditioned. If your right is catching you are on ego trip. All right, so you, now you know very simple method is to know that through vibrations you can find out Mr Ego is there or superego is there or you are wobbly. This is the biggest thing we have got because this is my preparation. My preparation is this, that first give you realization; first give you realization. Once you are realized, then I won’t have to say much. If you are conditioned on the left side you’ll get pains, this, that. If you are conditioned right-hand side you’ll have problems with health or something. So you will come to me and I will be able to tell you. This is my own preparation, is to make you alert and aware, so that you have light to see things.


Now your preparation should be to use this awareness, all the time. For that I will go to say that to use this knowledge within you all the time. That people forget. So the first, we must know that this preparation has been done for us. We have got the vibrations. We have got the knowledge to verify, and we must use this. That you are in a new dimension, is the first acceptance. If you have that acceptance within you, then your judgement will be better. But this acceptance is missing. Now there is in Sanskrit a word, abhyaas, that every day doing the same thing in that manner you will remember that you are realized and that your awareness is not that of the awareness of ordinary people. 


So, first preparation is to prepare yourself, to tell yourself that you have this new awareness within you, is to make yourself known. You see, in the University when you graduate, there is a ceremony held for that. You have to go with a gown and they give you a proper role and all that. Why is it necessary? Because you may forget you are a graduate. Yes, and that’s exactly what happens to you, that you forget you are realized souls. I mean, we have had a ceremony in the sense that, I mean, everything we have done to prove that you are realized souls, but this is what is missing from our people, that they cannot understand that they are realized souls, that they are people who are on a level that nobody is. 


You are twice-born people who are very, very rare. Very rarely you will find people who are twice-born. I mean, I have found nobody – can you imagine – all my lifetime, except for my father and a few here, and I mean they are not to be counted because my father I’ve chosen chosen; that’s how. So, first of all if you make yourself known to your own intelligence that, ‘’I am a realized soul,” you will be seeing that your priorities will be changing very fast. I mean, supposing somebody gives you a huge big property or a huge big wealth. Immediately, immediately you become conscious of it. You see, you start walking like this. When you are a student you walk like this. Suddenly you get the degree and walk like this. What about realization? [Shri Mataji talks in an aside to Sahaja Yogi.] So happy to see you here very happy, May God Bless.


What about your realization? Why you got your realization? Then what are you doing about it? This is the first preparation, is of identifying that you are a realized soul. We have to talk in a different way. We are realized souls now. We are people of a different knowledge. We are people of a different awareness. As I told you, now see this beautiful building is, we all are enamoured by it, and it looks very beautiful, is done so well, beautifully and is very important for human beings. All right? But for the Divine even this green leaf is more important than the whole building put together and all such buildings put together. For the Divine, because that leaf is living and a bird which is more aware than that leaf is, is much more important to the Divine. So you, the human beings who are now aware to this extent how much important you must be to Divine. How much God Himself must be interested in you, just think of it. Once you recognise this point, then relatively you will also know that you are very important in God’s plan. Not world plan I am talking; it is God’s plan. So all the forces of his blessings and all his loftiness, all of them are with, to help you, to support you, to give you whatever you like. You are on the stage, and they are looking after you. I mean, now you have entered on the stage. 


But I find Sahaja Yogis, once they get realisation, I don’t know what happens to them, that if they give up their ego then they become like, absolutely you see, I don’t know what you call them. Bananas? Each one of you is the special one created by God. Now you see for yourself, just think of yourself. I mean, you are the ones who know such a lot about life. Even if you get a little bit possessed, doesn’t matter. But you know that you are possessed. Now think of it.


This is the second preparation one has to have is understanding that it is God Almighty himself, worried about you. He’s sent everybody to help you, go ahead, so you don’t have to worry about your money, you don’t have to worry about all other things. The third thing comes automatically, that you don’t have to worry about all these things at all. They’ll be looked after. You all are being looked after. You know that. Everyone has been helped, but if you know that He’s Almighty and that He’s compassion and that you have fallen into His grace, think of it. 


Establish yourself at that point. This is the preparation one has to have, that He is the one who has given all this. Then, the modern Sahaja Yogis are specially blessed because they have a walkie-talkie with them. Any problem that they have are handled in form, in person. There was never such a lesson before, but ego is the point, how to. To begin with it is ego. You have seen it. If you have ego you will not accept you are a realized soul. Imagine, how silly it is. If you have a superego also you will not recognise it. You will go back to the same position as you were. You will never accept that you are a realized soul if you have a superego. You will never accept it. “Oh, how can it be, Mother? After all what, you see, I am an ordinary human being.” You will go on like that, “How can I cure others? How can I give realisation? It is not possible.” You see, this kind of a humility, nonsensical. I mean, it’s all right, I mean it’s like a sower saying, “Oh, how can I cure?” It’s like that. It’s like no meaning. This kind of a humility has no meaning for you. “How can I do it, Mother? What can I do? Oh, I am no good. I am no use.” This language must be given up. And then it is ego. Then it is even worse. You can harm yourself and you can harm Sahaja Yoga at the extreme point. Egoistical people are extremely difficult. They are such a drag, because they try to do everything through their intelligence and understanding and this and that, and such a rambling goes on and on and on, and you try to pull them back again; they go back. It’s so boring  very boring, because you know, I see the stuff supposing I know this is it. I want you to have it, and between taking this cup to the lip, every time you are pulling it out. Every time you are pulling it. Now how am I to take it to your lip?. It’s very boring, and this egoistical temperament is very prevalent in the West, surprisingly, and I just don’t understand. They can take to all kinds of filth, all kinds of perversions without arguing  about it,  you know. Just take to it, any kind of perversion. “What’s wrong?” But it is for them the most wrong thing is to be accepting the fact that you are a realized soul through Sahaja Yoga. They’ll take anything else, but not the truth. This ego is like a horse sitting on your head. You have to sit on the horse, and the horse is sitting on your head. You are carrying the load of the horse. Imagine, what is the sense in such a thing?


If you start analysing yourself, again you go into another trip. You see, here you have been such trippers, you see, like Jack-in-the-box, you see, because you have been taking trips after trips. That’s sort of a spring. You see, you try to see your ego. You go on a trip of superego. You try to see your superego and you trip. I mean, a person who has been bouncing all the time, sort of, to this trip or that trip or that trip or that trip, you see? It’s just like a person travelling all the time. He doesn’t know whether he has to get down or has to go further. It’s like that. The habit of the mind is so egoistical that you just take the ride on the thing, but the theory of it is not that you take the ride, but the ego takes you on a ride. And whenever there is any such a thing coming up it grabs you, and the progress is extremely slow.


Now the trouble, the Divine is that it has Its own protocol. If the King has to come to your house you have to go and invite the King. The King doesn’t write to you that, “Please invite me to your house,” does he? That’s why he’s King, after all, and he doesn’t implore people that, “Please invite me.” This Mr Ego expects that you should be invited by the Divine. That Divine must go out of the way to fetch you out. Ego, in simple words, is nothing but absolutely wrong ideas about one’s own value, by which you think that, “I am everything.” What are you? Now go on to superego trip. What are we? Nothing. We cannot even sprout the seed. Every day-to-day life you can see this clearly, how ego jumps up. Supposing somebody says, that, “British have these qualities,” one feels very happy. “Oh, what a praise it is. What a praise for British. Oh, we are British,” immediately. Somebody says that, “British lack these qualities,” finished. You are absolutely,  then that person is the worst person in the whole world.


First of all, you must know that neither you are British, nor Indian nor anything. You are just human beings. Ignorance is responsible for this ego. It is complete ignorance about yourself gives you this ego. So once we are going towards light, we must know, what are our hurdles, is the preparation, is the ignorance, that we have about ourselves that’s why, we are going to see ourselves and because of the ignorance, ego and super-go both have come onto us. So at least we’ll have nothing to do with them. I mean, supposing you have to go on the Himalayas, all right? Then you are going for an expedition. You are supposed to carry the lightest things that you have. You don’t carry three luggage of different carriers, four luggage of this, and five things of that to have a nice little bed there and sleep over. All that, you see, in the same way when you are going on the expedition of knowing yourself, all that is loading up yourself must be put down.


So again we come to ego and superego. Actually, these two are terrible elephants which must be kept down on the ground. So we make our own study. You see, these preparations are needed because we have already gone on this side too much or that side too much. So the preparation is to bring you down. Come along here. Now you stand in the centre or we bring you down here and stand in the centre. The preparation is nothing but is just to bring you down here; that’s all. So with ego we move on and see what the ego has subtler and subtler and subtler forms. Even in superego you have subtler and subtler and subtler forms. To understand ego, you must see, what do you plan about your life? It’s very easy. What are your plans about future life? To understand your superego you must know what affects you very much, what makes you very unhappy or, you can say, what makes you more happy and what makes you more unhappy. Both things, happiness and unhappiness, are the shadows of these two trees. One is ego; another is the superego. Just watch yourself. What makes you very happy? Good clothes, good living or when your name appears in  [unclear] or all such nonsensical things which makes you laugh, you see, all that. You just see that. What makes you unhappy? When, I mean, some sort of a heartbreak and this and that, you see all this kind of a nonsense. Both things are not yourself. They are just outside. So what is inside, if you have to find out, first the outside must be taken away. If you have to taste the fruit you take out the outside. You peel it out. In the same way, this must be peeled out.


Now this you should see within yourself and without also. You can see it very clearly without. It’s  very easy. How you deal with others is the point. What is your relationship with others?  It is easier to know this outside than inside perhaps. When you talk to others, what is the impact they have from you? Are you appreciated by others or not? How about Sahaja Yogis? Do you respect another Sahaja Yogi as a Sahaja Yogi or not? Do you expect that whatever stage you are, the other Sahaja Yogi will also come up and he must be given the due respect? Also you must see that when any Sahaja Yogi who has achieved something or who is at a better level tries to pull you up, do you like it or resist it or get upset about it? If somebody tells you this should be done, that should be done, do you take it as if he has abused you? If he is telling you about Sahaja Yoga, you should be thankful. I mean, in all normal way I would, I feel thankful to you if you tell Me something that concerns Sahaja Yoga. Anything, even if you tell Me, “Mother this may not be all right if You say. You see, the human beings are like this,” I accept it and I do it according to your wishes. Or do you like it or not, this is how you will judge your ego. This is only your Mr Ego. Actually, it is better to have another person to fight your ego and yourself both put together. If somebody tells you that, “This should be done,” “Oh, I see, I have been doing that. Yes, all right. You come and help me. Pull me out. Work it out. Try and help me. I am horrible.” That’s the way; if you do it you can get over this ego. But the other person should know, “You are very nice. All right, do what you please,” and then you feel happy. This person is not so all right and you are also not so all right. Because, you have to pull out people. For example, if you understand that you are in a crisis, you are in an emergency, people are getting drowned and some people are trying to pull them out, they themselves are halfway down, halfway up, they are trying to pull you out, at that time if they say, “Hold my hand!” now, if you feel upset about it then you are not wise.


Now in Sahaja Yoga there is no leader as such. I mean, nobody is appointed as leader. Anybody tries to do that, he goes down. But there is an innate leadership within, and such a person is extremely humble and congenial and appealing and commanding, too, has to be commanding. And one should not feel bad at that time, because if he says, “Go and steal something or you go and join some,” one of these nonsensical things, then of course he is wrong, but he feels saying that in Sahaja Yoga have to come up. Even dominatingly if he says, I mean it’s a very good thing, I would say. Supposing somebody is in your neighbourhood who is always criticising you. In a way is a blessing because if there’s somebody who is criticising us he’s trying to perfect us. I mean, we should think it’s not to feel bad about it. Supposing somebody is saying something about you, if it is not true then what is there to feel bad? If he is telling lies about you, there is nothing to be frightened about. If he is telling the truth, then you have to be thankful, though sometimes the truth can be very unpalatable. It could be very, very bad but it is a good thing. There is a saying in Marathi, “Keep the house of the person who is a backbiter, the one who backbites. Keep the house of such a man who is your backbiter next to you, next door.” That you know your defects, you see, you correct yourself. Is the wise attitude because you cannot correct yourself. So have a mirror by which  you correct yourself.  I mean, you should thank such a man that he is criticising you. See, by pampering you if he is going to completely destroy you. What’s the use? This is what the gurus are doing. They are all pampering you and destroying you and ultimately you find that all of you have been different. So if you accept the situation in which you say, “All right, if this is what is going to be the truth it’s very much better for my ego, and if it is not the truth then what is so important?”


This attitude helps in Sahaja Yoga very much. A very wise attitude towards oneself and you will be surprised as you’ll grow with this attitude, you won’t be easily hurt by what people say to you. You won’t bother. You know how much people criticise Me and say all kinds of things, argue with Me, and I’m not bothered because I know they are foolish. What is there? They are stupid people. What is there? Even if they praise Me, what is it? After all, whatever they praise Me is My nature, nothing so great. See, it makes no difference. I am just watching My chakras working. I’m not bothered. In the same way, it will happen to you. You’ll not be bothered, but this will help your unloading. This will help your unloading.


And, the unhappy part of it, in that we should prepare ourselves in a way that, “Nothing can make me unhappy. What can make me unhappy if I am a realised soul?” you say, all right? Supposing you want to marry someone, take the concrete thing, and you find the person has sort of misbehaved or triggered of, so what? “I am there. my value is myself I know.” So your value, your self-esteem should be such that nothing should make you unhappy. It’s all a drama going on. It’s all a drama, but these things must  be accepted by your great intelligence, because what I find here is the difficulty with the Western mind is this,  that it has too much of IQ, you see, too much over-developed. So it is such a polished surface that nothing stays there, everything. The first simple thing that you are a realized soul itself settled down there somehow. And to your intelligence that, “You are a realized soul now.” All of you believe in the heart, not in the brain, that you are a realized soul, is first thing you must tell your intelligence, and then you must tell your intelligence also that, “Nothing can make me unhappy and nothing can befool me.” If these three points settle down on your intelligence, you see, I will see the rest of it. You just fix these three points on your intelligence. Then you will be amazed. You will become a very loving person, extremely considerate of others. It will all work out automatically because, you see, when your intelligence is like that nothing, you are all the time worried about others. Either you are afraid of others or you are angry toward others. You cannot go straight forward, you know. This is how it happens. If you could understand these three points clearly…


Yogi speaks. 


Shri Mataji   She says, “Nobody does that. That’s the problem.” Is absolutely. She’s so practical. She is so practical, you see. Just now in the cars she said, “Everybody does something or other. They do not do what is the first to be done.” Like she said, “They’ll marry, we have to marry and enjoy your wife and your husband and your children. They’ll do everything else but that.” It is that, you see, nobody does that. She’s so practical, you know. If you do it, listening to Mataji is not the thing I want you to do. Now I want you to do but the doing of it is, sit down and tell your intelligence, your IQ, that, “Mr IQ, now please listen. This is what has happened to me, and this is what I am. I am a realized soul and nothing should pamper me and nothing should make me unhappy. That’s all. Nobody can hurt me.” Otherwise you are, “Ohhhh, ohhhh,” like this. You go in two ways, never in a straight way, where just you are compassion and you are love, absolutely relying upon yourself, and then you have Me with you. And you think of those soldiers who had nobody to guide, nobody to tell, nobody to talk to. All your granthis and all that, I am breaking. You don’t have to do anything but only thing you don’t create your own granthis, your own knots. If you do not create these things will work out. This is a very simple preparation. So I don’t have to tell,  “Love your brothers and sisters,” and this and that. That’s going the other way around, but you just tell your intelligence, “This is enlightenment of the intelligence.” If that intelligence comes into you then it is wisdom. That “Anybody is laughing at me or everybody’s making fun of me or anybody is trying to dominate me,” all these fears or all these aggressiveness, all this will disappear just like that.


But now you are a flower and you are fragrant and the fragrance is knowing, and many of these are going to come to you. That’s what you are. This is the beginning. Go on telling yourself like that, if you could do that, if you can bring your intelligence to this level, not too high, not too low but in the centre, everything can be solved in no time. I am now living with you people, going through your Kundalinis, all that. I have found out at this point only, that you just don’t tell your intelligence this. So that you start giving up, all kinds of fanaticism, all fears and this, and superstitions and all nonsense, because nothing can harm you.  No stars can harm you, not your science can harm you, what time you were born. Nothing can harm you now. You are beyond it. So astrology is finished. Horoscopes are finished. All other -- what other things you have, like this. Karma, Karmas are finished. Palmistry is finished. Biorhythm’s finished. Biorhythm’s finished. All that. I mean, you are beyond that. Now all these things, all such things.


Then the other side of it. All love affairs finished, all fear of love affairs finished, everything finished, nonsense. It’s only love. Now whosoever you will get, you will love this person; that person will love you. If he doesn’t care or loves you, it doesn’t matter. As long as you love, finished. All expectations finished, all expectations finished. Joy is singular, absolute. When we are in joy, you at a state where there is no movement. You’re just there. So get rid of this both feelings of, “ I am very happy now. I am now in joy and established in joy and that’s what I have to grow within, me not that my old stuffs.” That’s dead, finished. When the trees drop out their leaves, people don’t expect them to again rise and get attached to the trees. In the same way whatever is gone and finished is finished now. Now let us know what is new coming in, and this is to be nurtured now. It’s the joy; it’s that dignified majestic, that beauty within ourselves. Then you don’t get upset, not bothered by what others have to say about you. It will happen, it will happen, if you put it down on your intelligence and people will see that in you because you don’t do anything funny, you don’t do anything wrong. People like it. Even those who are not realized will see that dignity in you that you are so dignified, because you have your own understanding of yourself. It’s a very simple thing, but as she has said it, nobody does it. Tell your intelligence. Even now I find that some people do have that joy within them trickling in. 


But you have to prosper into that. You have to come into that, dropping out all that is nonsensical. Otherwise you will go off like that and it takes hardly any time or hardly anything. Whatever is done wrong, stop it. Just to be finished off because it’s dead now. So why bother about it? Just to finish off. Because if I tell you something, say, with a harsh tone, it will not stick on there. If I do it delicately also it will not work out, because, what I told you there’s a polish. Take out the polish, and what is the polish? Polish is the all understanding of norms, the all understanding of norms of life, Because you thought that if you were in this condition you would be happy. That’s why you are doing it, because you thought, if you do like this there is a fear there’s the left-side problem. But if this all understanding of the mind, if you clear it out with your light, with your own wisdom, then you’ll be amazed. This thing stick into you, completely. This wisdom will stick into you. Forget that old nonsense. So many things you have already sorted out yourself. You know so many things which were nonsensical before. But the identification of all these ideas should be achieved. Should be achieved, is the point. You know that this is all nonsensical. But is to be achieved. That’s the preparation. You see, you have the light. You have the movement now. You are moving into it, but the light is not here, dangles sometimes falls like this, falls like that. If you can fix your light properly, just by this understanding that whatever were the norms  before were due to ignorance, and we have to have our norms of our own now. What is the Sahaja Yogis? And these norms are going to tell you how these norms are going to come to you. Like faith, like entire dependence on spirituality, entire dependence on the vibrations. All these norms of the new life, we have to accept. But to be achieved, I mean to say to be achieved, you see. Not just to be understood in a lecture. So I’ll tell you about that in the evening, and tomorrow I will tell you the real becoming. All right?  Thank you.


May God bless you.


Just go on saying, now are you for opening? You do not want to assume your positions. That’s the problem. Better? This is what I am saying, you see moving out just say that, “Nothing can happen. No bhoot can catch me. I can catch the bhoots.” That’s the truth.


Yogi: Do you want your lunch in here?


Shri Mataji:  I will have it in here with you people.
