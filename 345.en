Mahasahasrara day. Gorai Creek, Bombay (India) 5 May 1983.

On behalf of all of you, I thank the Sahaja Yogi organisers of Bombay, who have made these arrangements and on my own behalf also, I thank them a lot. This is a beautiful place they have chosen for us. It is also a gift of God, that at this time the thing about which I was going to speak, sitting under the same trees the talk of Sahasrara is taking place. Fourteen years ago (or we could say already thirteen years have passed and now the fourteenth year has started) this great work of opening the Sahasrara was accomplished in this world. I have told you about this many times on every Sahasrara day, as to what had happened, how it was done and what is it's importance.

       But the fourteenth birthday is very important because man lives at fourteen levels and the day he crosses over the fourteenth level, he becomes a complete Sahaja Yogi. Therefore, today Sahaja Yoga has also become Sahaja Yogi. Like this, God has created fourteen levels within us. If you simply count them, then you know that there are seven Chakras within us. Besides these, there are two more Chakras, about which you do not talk much - they are the chakra of Moon (Lalita) & chakra of Sun (Shri). Then there is "Hamsa" Chakra.

       Thus there are three more - seven plus three make ten. Then - there are four chakras above the Sahasrara. And about these chakras also, I have told you-ARDHA-BINDU, BINDU, VALAYA and PRADAKSHINA. These are the four. After coming to Sahaja Yoga and after your Sahasrara has opened, you have to pass through these four chakras, ARDHA-BINDU, BINDU, VALAYA and PRADAKSHINA. After passing through these four chakras only, can you say that you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

       And if you see from another angle, we have to cross fourteen stages in reaching up to Sahasrara; if you divide them then there are seven chakras situated on Ida Nadi (Channel) and seven on Pingala Nadi. When man makes his ascent, he does not do so in straight direction. He comes first to left then goes to right, then again to left and then again to right. And when Kundalini ascends, it also does so, dividing Herself into these two. The reason for it can be understood if I take the example of two ropes. These two ropes together, side by side - in the process of going up or coming down cross over twice. (Here Shri Mataji explained the rising of Kundalini along Ida & Pingala Nadis; and making 4 loops - two each in opposite directions - (clockwise and anti clockwise) at every chakra.)* When Kundalini ascends, you see on the chakra whether the left is caught or the right is caught. Although Kundalini is only one, but on every chakra you see both the things - thus you know whether left is caught or the right. Thus, within us, if each chakra is divided into these two - left and right - then seven two's are, fourteen; similarly within us first of all fourteen stages have to be crossed before reaching the Sahasrara. And if you understand this - that these seven, and seven above - this way also a path of fourteen is created.

       Therefore this thing 'fourteen' is very important in Kundalini Shastra (Science). Very important. It's a very important thing. We should fully understand that we become entitled to the Blessings of Sahaja Yoga only after rising above these fourteen stages. We should unceasingly march forward and (as we imbibe it) get completely 'dyed' in it. Rajana, Birajana - these words I have said to you many times earlier, also; but today, specially, we should understand that on Sahasrara day what is Rajana (to reign, to be the master), what is Birajana (to assume).

       Now, you are sitting, you look at these trees. This is the tree of Shriphala. Nariyal is called Shriphala. Coconut is called Shriphala. Shriphala, which is coconut - whether you have ever thought about it or not, I don't know. But it is a thing to be really thought about - 'Why is it called Shriphala?' This grows along the sea-coast and nowhere else. The best fruit grows at the sea coast. The reason is this, that the sea - it is the 'Dharma'. Wherever there is dharma, only there, the Shriphala blossoms. Where there is no dharma, Shriphala will not grow there.

       But 'all' things are contained in the sea. All sorts of - cleanliness, dirt; everything is inside it. This water is also full of salt. It has salt in it. Christ had said that 'You are the salt of the earth'. Means, you can enter into everything. You can impart taste to everything. 'Are the salt' - without salt man cannot live. The 'prana-shakti' (Life-force) that we take in, if we don't have salt within us, then even that prana-shakti cannot work. It is a catalyst. And this salt - it fully organizes for us to live, to live in this world, to live in the 'prapancha' (illusionary world). Without salt, man would be of no use.

       But when this thing rises towards God (Paramatma), then it leaves all the salt below -everything is left. And when the light of the sun falls on these trees, and with the falling of sun-light as the sap of its leaves and the sap of the whole tree is sucked upwards because evaporation takes place - then, this water flows upwards through the trunk; leaving 'everything' it crosses those fourteen things and on reaching the top, is formed Shriphala. You are that same Shriphala. And it is essential to offer Shriphala to the Devi. Without the offering of Shriphala, the puja is not considered 'Sampanna' (accomplished). Also Shriphala is made up in a strange way. There is no 'phala' (fruit) in the worId like the Shriphala. No part of it (tree) goes waste. Each and every part of it is used. From its leaves down to everything is used. And of Shriphala itself - each and every thing is used.You can see that the Shriphala is also like human being's Sahasrara. Like the hair we have, the same way Shriphala also has hair. 'This (Sahasrara) is the Shriphala'. This has hair on the outside for protection. The protection from death is provided to us by the hair. Therefore hair have been given great respect; hair are great and a very powerful thing - because they protect you. You are protected by them. And inside this - like we have cranial bones - that too you see, that inside the Shriphala there's a hard kind of a covering on the outside, like this. After that inside us - grey matter and white matter - two such things are inside us. In the Shriphala, too, you see - white matter and grey matter,... and inside that is water, which is the cerebrospinal fluid inside us. Inside that (Shriphala) also there is water - that is the Iimbic area.

       So this sakshat Shriphala, itself is - if, for them (trees) this is the fruit, then for us, 'this' is the fruit. Our brain is the fruit of the whole of our evolution. Whatever has been our evolution to date - that from amoeba, today we have become humans - we have got all that, as a result of this brain. From the brain, all this --- whatever we have got - is through this brain. Within this are all kinds of powers; of all kind. Within this is collected all the wealth that has been received by us.

       Now, the Atma (Spirit) resides inside this heart and after Sahaja-Yoga its light spreads within us in seven layers, from both sides that can happen only when one's Sahasrara is open. Till now, we have been doing the same job with our brain; before realization - ego and super-ego - through these two whatever work is to be done, that we do; nothing except this. Ego and super-ego, or you can say, "manas" and ego - with the help of these two we do all our work. But after reaIization, we work with the help of our Atma. Atma, before realization resides within the heart. - Absolutely separate - as a 'Ksh√©tragya' (witness of the field). Its job: whatsoever it may be - just to witness - it keeps doing. But its light's not in our chitta (attention), it is separate from us. It is not in our chitta.

       After realization, it comes into our chitta, first. First it comes into the chitta. And chitta, you know, is in the Void. After that, its light comes into the truth, because with the entering of light into our brain (as the brain gets enlightened) we know the truth. "Know". Doesn't mean that we know through the intellect, but know in reality (Sakshat) that 'this is the truth'. After that its light is seen in the heart. The heart becomes profound, heart starts expanding, starts becoming vast, its power of love starts increasing. That's why - 'Sacchidananda' - Sat, Chitta and Anand (Truth, attention and bliss (joy)). Truth within our brain, chitta within our dharma; and joy within our Atma - start getting enlightened. Its light spreads gradually at first, this you all know. Its light grows slowly and slowly, it's a subtle thing, very subtle at first, because the gross set-up we live in, in that set-up, it becomes difficult to catch hold of that subtle. Gradually that hold also develops. After that you start to grow, to progress. With the opening of a single curtain of Sahasrara, the Kundalini comes up. But its light does not start spreading all around just then. The Kundalini has just come up and you have saluted the seat of Sadashiva. Within you, the light of Atma has started flowing hazily. But it has not yet fully blossomed in this brain. Now, the surprising thing is, that if you want to spread it through your brain, you cannot. Our brain and our heart - now a perfect balance of these will have to be shown. You know well, that when you work too much with your intellect, heart- failure occurs. And when you work too much with your heart, the brain fails. There exists a relationship between them, it already exists, it's a very deep relationship. And because of this deep relationship, when you get your realization their relationship has to become deeper. The relationship between the heart and this brain should be 'very' deep. The moment it gets completely integrated, your (chitta) attention becomes completely Parameshwar-Swarup, (one with supreme God). This very thing is also said in Hatha-Yoga, that Manas (super- ego) and Ahamkara (ego) both get 'Laya' (dissolved, disappear). But just by telling like this nobody is going to understand, how can the dissolution of ego and super-ego be effected ? So they get after super-ego, get after ego. If you beat down the ego, the super-ego comes up, if you beat down the super-ego, the ego come's up. They just cannot understand that what is this madness ? How will this go?

       How to win over the super-ego and the ego? There's only one door for that - Agnya chakra. By working on the Agnya-chakra the two, ego and super-ego get completely dissolved. And as soon as they get dissolved, the heart and this brain first establish a complete concord. But the oneness doesn't come. "It is this oneness, that we have to achieve." So, your heart, that itself becomes the Sahasrara and your Sahasrara, that itself, the heart. What you think is in your heart; and whatever is in your heart, that only you think. When your state becomes like this, then, any kind of doubts, any kind of disbelief, any kind of fear - no such thing remains. Like, when a person fears, what is done to him ? He is taught through the brain : "Look here, there's nothing to fear. Look you were fearing for a useless thing. Now take a light and see." Then, although he understands through his brain, again he fears.

       But when both the things become one you try to understand this point - that the brain, through which you think, which makes your Manas understand, and takes care of it; if that brain itself becomes your Mana ( ). Means, - just imagine that there's such an instrument which has an automatic accelerator and brake; and both are 'one'. Whenever it wants, it becomes the brake and whenever it wants, it becomes the accelerator - moreover it knows everything.

       When such a state comes, then you become the complete Master (Guru). Such a state we should definitely achieve. Till now, you people have progressed a lot; you have reached quite a high level. Definitely, now it should be said of you, that now you have become Shriphala. But I always talk of what is ahead, because - if this tree is to be climbed, then - have you seen how people climb ? If you make a man climb and see, then you will understand that he ties a rope around himself and keeps hooking that rope higher. When that rope is hooked higher up, then with its help, he climbs. In the same way.. as we climb, our own rope has always to be kept hooked higher. And only when you learn this, can your climbing be very quick. But mostly we keep hooking the rope lower. Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, we hook the rope lower and say that "Mother, we have made no progress at all". Now, how possibly can there be any ? - when you hook the rope in the opposite direction and make arrangements for coming down ? While coming down, you do not even need to hook the rope. You just loosen it a bit and - zoom - you will come down ! That arrangement is already made - for coming down. It is to climb up, for which arrangement has to be made. So, to become something, hard work has to be put in. And to lose whatever has been achieved, no hard work is required - you come straight down, to the ground; there's no question about it.

       This, if you understand, this point, then you will realize that 'Always set your sight higher'. If you are standing at any step of a ladder but your sight is set higher; then this person is higher than that person, who, though standing on a higher step, sets his sights lower. This is why sometimes even very old Sahaja Yogis, (suddenly) come down. People say that "Mother, he/she was such an old Sahaja Yogi; was for so many years with you; did this, did that" - But their sights always remained set lower ! Then what can I do ? If the sight was set lower, they came down.

       Sight should always be set higher. Now even to see this fruit (Shriphala), you have to take your sight up. Even their sight is set upwards. The sight of all these is set higher, because without keeping their sight upwards, - they know - that, neither can they get Surya or get this work done, nor can they, become Shriphala. Tree should be very well observed and understood. You can learn Sahaja Yoga very well from a tree. These are very great Gurus for you. Like, when we look towards a tree, we should first observe how it settles its roots. First, it takes care of and fixes its roots. And to take care of and fix its roots, what does it do? It keeps penetrating and going deep into the roots. This is our dharma, this is our chitta (attention) - 'within this' it keeps going deep. And with that attention it sucks, that all-pervading power. This is an inverted tree - it's better to say this way. These roots start sucking that all-pervading power; and after sucking this, after all what has it to do? Then it's sight goes higher - and this way that Shriphala is formed. Your Sahasrara is also like this very Shriphala - is extremely dear to Mother; and this very Sahasrara should be surrendered to Her. Many people said to me yesterday that: 'Mother, we feel the coolness (of vibrations) in the hands; also in the feet, but not here (Sahasrara)."

       "WHO" presides there ?" - just know this; the coolness will come from here. And the One, who is sitting there, 'is the 'fruit' of 'all' things. The roots of this tree, fixed in the soil below, they are also borne out from it. Its trunk, its hard work, its evolution - 'all' this in the end becomes that fruit. Everything is inherent in that fruit. You put that fruit in the soil and again the whole of this thing will be borne out. "It is the meaning of all, it is the ultimate of all." In the whole world, whatever work of God has taken place, until this day, whatever work He has done, its whole complete form, the form of its fruit is our Mahayoga of today ! And who is its Swamini (Presiding Deity) - you know!

       So, on such an auspicious time you have come (on this earth) and received this. So you should feel blessed and becoming like this 'Shriphala', you should be surrendered in offering. The fruit is only removed from the tree when it is mature - otherwise it is useless. Before it is mature it cannot be offered to Mother. Therefore develop maturity, leave childishness. Till childishness remains, you will keep sticking to the tree. But for offering, what is the use of the fruit which is sticking to the tree? If it is removed from the tree and then offered, only then is the Puja considered accomplished. So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, - in a very great symbolic form verily (Sakshat) Shriphala itself is standing before you. It is indeed a great blessing that here, today, all of us have gathered and in this great celebration all these trees have also given us company. They are also 'nadita' ( ) (resounding with) all the things; they are also 'Spandita' ( ) pulsating; and they are also listening, and dancing to the same rythm. They also understand the special significance of the whole thing. In the same way you also have Shriphala. Fully mature it. There is only one way to mature it, that you have concord with your heart. The important thing is: to become one with the heart. There is no difference between the heart and the brain. From the heart we desire and from the brain it is fulfilled. When both the things become one, only then will you be fully benefitted.

       Now for common people Sahaja Yoga is a very secret thing. They are not going to understand-because their daily life is of that level only. On that they move. But your level is different. You must live at 'your own' level. When you look towards others, mostly it is with compassion because what are these poor people ? What is going to happen to them ? Where will they go ? They don't understand. What is their state ? On what path are they going to land up?-Understanding this, you people try to understand that : if, by explaining to them, they understand Sahaja Yoga, then its very good, try to make them understand. But if they do not bother, then there's no use of breaking our heads before them. There is no use of breaking one's Shriphala. Keep it safely protected.

       lts job is much higher. You have got it for a very much higher purpose and keep it at that higher level and only on attaining that accomplished ( ) wonderful ( ) unique state you can consider yourself blessed. Therefore, there's no need to break our heads for meaningless things. There is no need to argue with anyone. But your own state must be maintained and you must not come down. Until this happens, the full surrender which was to be acheived within you, that you have not achieved in Sahaja Yoga. Whatever was to be imbibed, that is not achieved. Whatever growth was to occur, that is not achieved. Whatever was to be your mastery and full growth, that is not achieved and you got caught in a misconception. Therefore on no false premise should you think that 'I have become some great Sahaja Yogi' or anything. When you become very great, then you bow down, you keep bowing down automatically.

       Look at these trees. The breeze is flowing in the opposite direction. Actually the trees should be bent towards this side, when the breeze is flowing in this direction. But in which direction are the trees bowing down ? Have you ever marked that all the trees are facing in that direction? Why? The breeze is coming from that direction and pushing them, even then, why are the trees bending towards the same side? And if this breeze does not flow then one doesn't know how much further they may bend ! Because they know that 'it' (Sea) is the one who is the Giver of everything. Being reverent and extremely humble, ( ) they are bowing to it. And the one who is 'the Giver', 'that' is the 'Dharma'.The dharma which is inside us, when it gets fully awakened, starts fully manifesting, only then will the Shriphala inside us be so sweet, beautiful and nourishing. And then the world will get to know from your life itself, what you are - and not from anything else.

       Now, fourteen times you have celebrated the birthday of this Sahasrara, and how many more years you will celebrate. But till this Sahasrara day, whenever you celebrated the birthday, your Sahasrara has also been opening and growing, along with it.

       To accept any kind of compromise, to loosen hold on yourself in any matter, does not behave a Sahaja Yogi. A person who is a Sahaja Yogi, should bravely make his path and move forward. Any number of obstacles - the relatives, the family, this, that, all such ridiculous diversions - they have no meaning. These have been with you a thousand times. In this life you have to achieve; and by your achieving it, if the others also get then they are blessed; it is their fortune. If they don't get it, will you pull them up by your hands? It is like this, that if you go to the sea and have huge stones attached to your feet, and you request the sea, 'Look, Sir, swim me across'. The sea will reply, "First remove those stones tied to your feet, otherwise how can I carry you across?" To your feet you have tied these huge rocks. It is better to get rid of them, and if you can't cut them off, then at least do this, - keep yourself away from them. All these types of things that you have tied to your feet - 'you break them and rise higher'. Tell them - 'Go; whatever you want to do, you do, but have nothing to do with us'. - Because there are so many more such badhas, and attaching these unnecessary badhas also is of no use.

       Look at the way these trees hold such a heavy fruit so high. How heavy is this fruit - it has water inside. It holds this fruit high. In the same way you have to hold your head high and while holding it high, remember that the head should be respectfully bowed towards the sea - the sea, which is the sign of dharma. It has to be reverently and humbly bowed ( ) towards the Dharma. Many Sahaja Yogis do not understand at all that unless and until we have fully settled in the dharma, we just cannot be Sahaja Yogis. They go on committing all kinds of mistakes. For example many people take tobacco, smoke cigarettes, drink liquor; keep doing all this; and then they say. 'We have not progressed in Sahaja Yoga'. Then how can there 'be'? You yourself are after your own life.

       There are some small-rules in Sahaja Yoga - 'very' simple and straight forward - you have been given power to practice these. You bring them fully in your daily observances, in your behaviour. And the biggest thing that is expressed in the bowing of the trees, is to be reverently, devotedly, humbly bowed ( ) and to make that love shine through from within. Everything that you have received from the Almighty, while surrendering that love to Almighty, we should keep in mind that we have love towards everyone.

       Finally, it should be said that the brain, or the Sahasrara in which there isn't love, there I don't reside. Only the idea of love should occur in the mind and what is to be done to manifest and radiate this love. If you reflect deeply, you will know that I am saying the same thing: "that how can we fill our hearts with love." We should only consider whether - "Whatever I am doing, is it in love? Is this being done in love? All that I am doing, is it in Iove? Is everything, my talking and all my activities are being done in love ?" You can even beat someone in love - there is no harm in that. If there is something false, we can beat the person - there is no harm, but, is it happening in love?

       The Devi killed so many Rakshasas. That too She killed in love. Even they were loved. And so, in order that they may not further deteriorate from Rakshas to Maharakshas (greater Rakshas) and also for the love for Her Bhaktas (devotees), in order to save them, She killed the Rakshasas. In that Anant Shakti (limitless power) also, is the expression of love only. That which does them the real good (hita) is love. So, are you expressing that sort of love which does them real good? This has to be considered. And if you are really doing that then you have accomplished and acquired that thing, about which I have been speaking, namely "that concord" which should be achieved. So that concord has been established within you. There is only one Shakti (power) which we may call 'Love' and it is only 'Love' that shapes all things to become beautiful, shapely and fully organised. That which is just 'dry thought' has no meaning. And you know that 'dry thought' comes only from ego. And the second thing which comes from super-ego may well make it look beautiful from the outside but it is quite hollow inside. Therefore, one thing is dirty but dry, the other thing looks beautifuI but is incapable of giving any joy (NEERAS), is absolutely hollow. One is without joy and the other quite hollow. The concord between these two is not possible to be attained in any way because they are in opposition to each other.

       But after realization and after coming to Sahaja Yoga, all contrariness is lost, and the two things which appeared to be in opposition to each other seem to become as if they are two parts of one thing only. And this happening should take place within you. Only the day when this happening takes place within us, can we accept that we have fully celebrated the 14th birthday of our SAHASRARA.


        
       May God bless you.

       And on this auspicious occasion, on my own behalf, on behalf of all DEVATAS (Deities) and on behalf of PARAMATMA everlasting blessings (Anant Ashirvad) to you all.
