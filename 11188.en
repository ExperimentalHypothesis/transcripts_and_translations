Sahaja Yoga Integrates Everyone -May 29th 1976, Mumbai Seminar

[English translation from Marathi]

Many people come here with weird ideas. So, you keep to wisdom. To get wisdom is a difficult thing. Its easy to be crazy. Thus, you keep to wisdom. I am your Mother. If you do anything silly, anything wrong, I will have to tell you do not do this, it’s for your benevolence. I am not like gurus, I do not want anything from you. I only want your benevolence. Whatever is good for you, I will tell you, so please do not feel bad about it. There are some new people here, I also tell for them. If you feel bad about it, if you feel guilty, then its of no use, vibrations will disappear, on its own.(some lines not easy to hear.....) Are you feeling cool in your hands? Nice, let doctors know that this is control of the parasympathetic. Did you feel cool? Now you doctors have to come out, Doctors have their brains lost, no one wants to listen, what I can I do, I do not understand. They may keep a photo of a Deity at home, but if I say I will show connection between a Deity and Cancer, then they do not want to listen, then how can I talk to them? It’s a problem.Those who have not got realization keep your hands like this, and those who are sitting in meditation, watch like this, are you feeling cool? See if you are feeling cool in your hands. Nice, very good. See with hands like this, see.(Music.....)The sound which you heard just now, is similar to the sound of ‘Aum’ as we call it. Please understand that this energy is flowing. While the energy is flowing, but it’s not fully channelized yet then you get such sound. Once it starts channelizing then you get the sound like this, like Aum. Sometimes you may feel this noise in ears, sometime in your head, which means that the energy is not fully adjusted and channelized, that’s why you are hearing this noise. So, if you hear this noise, you need to know that the energy is not fully established, you need to fix it, and that cannot be done by a regular screw, has to be fixed by the screws of a mind. If you are able to fix this using screw’s of your mind, as this machine is different, so if you manage to fix the screws of your mind, then the wastage of this energy which today you are hearing in your ears, in your head, will disappear and it will become pure silence, complete silence. This is a best position, where the energy is in complete silence, then you will understand that you are at that stage, then you can use this energy. Do you understand that? Now, Aum, people say you get sound of Aum, 7 types of sounds, they get it, but that’s not correct. You should not get any sound from the energy. There are different sounds. So if you are getting sounds, mean this machine is not properly set, the energy is not adjusted correctly. Same like that. If you hear the sound of Aum, people say we achieved something great, they actually have half knowledge, that’s why they do not understand that actually they are wrong. Actually you should not get any noise.In the beginning if you get the noise, its ok, you are hearing a noise, which means energy is flowing, but then you have to adjust, what is happening, once you get adjusted, you should know, now this is fine. Now, you have to use this energy to receive and to give, both. For example, this microphone, if this has other noise, then how it can project my sound? So, if you need adjustments in your energy then how can you reflect God’s voice through you? How can His energy flow through you? That’s why this machine should be fully silent. Similarly, your inner energy should be completely silent inside. To get to the complete silence is the best activity. The energy should be every subtle delicate level fully silent, that’s the best. Then what comes from above (from the Divine), comes in your speech.So, let me tell you one thing. Other day, I was reading a book on Hatyoga, just wanted to see what they wrote. They explained in the book what is the meaning if you hear a noise. This means the machine is damaged. I made this machine; thus, I know its ruined. Do not keep hearing the machine, which is damaged, that’s not good. You hear the noise, because machine is not adjusted. You will experience this. If you are sick or you have problem, you may hear a noise in your head, because you have problem you will hear the noise. If you are completely relaxed, you will be in complete silence, and at peace. Then these two things will be established within you, i.e. Silence and Peace.Other thing I wanted to say, is that today we have short time. Once you all start coming to my feet, you break those. So, I request you, I need my feet. I have not insured those, so I request you please do not now touch my feet. It has lot of energy, but these are delicate. So, delicately if you can bow down will be good. You need not press my feet strongly, do not show your Marathi strength. Other day, people pressed my feet so badly that my daughter asked me, why these are so many blues on your feet. I understand that its out of love, but you should not go the extremes out of love. Rather you can show this love, with delicacy, with faith, with care. That’s what I would like to request. Finally, Mother is a Mother. Even if she is Goddess, she feels leaving her children.
