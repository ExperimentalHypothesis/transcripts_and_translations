Talk held in occasion of Shri Ganesha's Jayanti. Pratishthan (India), 10 February 2008.

Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis, because today Shri Ganesha was born. Shri Ganesha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the embodiment of purity (shuddha swaroop) and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (taal) and notes (sur). By His Grace only people become one with music (talleen). A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active. Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough. A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after worshipping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything, but you cannot recognize Him until you are realized. After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is. Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit. When He is awakened within us, then we have no questions left. Then we are successful, in whichever task we undertake. We find joy in everything we do. He is the embodiment of joy and gives joy to everyone. To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma). To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them. This pleases Him very much. Such an embodiment of love, such a pure-hearted Shri Ganesha was born today.

This is the importance of this day. Today if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it. It is His right to fulfill all your desires, because you are all realized. Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you in every way, every moment, every instant.

Today is a very big day, because the actual pure spirit has taken birth today. And He already had such an eternal state, that many people could not comprehend it or write about it. They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand that by the power of Shri Ganesha’s name you can get your realization. By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your realization, you can feel Him.

And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him. That is why people get misled and do wrong things. But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings you can do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems. Because He does all the work for you.

He takes care of you. Though He is a little boy, He looks after you. Shri Ganesha is a very great power by which so much work is getting done. For Me, He is the purest and My own. I trouble Him a lot, when somebody tries to trouble Me, I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him alright. When this fellow is unmanageable for Me, when there is a difficult person and it is possible for Me to handle him, then He does the job.

So today’s day is very auspicious as today He is born. Secondly today is Panchami (the Fifth Day). This Panchami is recognized because on this day we wear a dress, whatever we wear today is so that our body is properly covered. The sense of shame and chastity that our body has is because of Him. Lajja Rupena Samstithaha. So if you have any sense of chastity and shame, it is because of Him. That will benefit you immensely.

You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha. By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases, you become joyous, because He is the personification of joy (aanand swaroop). Because of this, both things are today, His birthday and His help. We take His help in any work what we do. Such is our way. But we don’t see what we have to do to awaken Him.

In that direction our attention does not go. We do not feel that we should become like Him, that we should have a state in which Shri Ganesha is awakened within us. With which we may never venture on the wrong path.

Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special, they despise all the wrong things in this world and they do not do anything wrong, because Shri Ganesha stops them. They cannot enjoy any wrong activities. This is Shri Ganesha’s great blessing that you have come into such a joyous life. So today in His service you sing His praise and glory, so that He may be pleased.

My Eternal Blessings to all of you.
