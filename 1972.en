[Hindi to English translation]

Talk held in occasion of Shri Ganesha Jayanti. Pratishthan (India), 10 February 2008.

Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis, because Shri Ganesha was born on this day. We worship Shri Ganesha and you got your awakening because of Him. No matter how much you think of Him, until you know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the embodiment of purity [shuddha swaroop] and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahma.

By coming into this world, He has created music [sangeet], rhythm [taal], and notes [sur]. By His Grace only, people become one with music [talleen]. A small boy came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone, and even today He is active. No matter how much you worship Shri Ganesha, it is not enough. A lot of people say, “We don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after worshipping Him so much. We do not attain Him.”

He is omniscient, omnipresent, and in every matter, but you cannot recognize Him unless you are realized. After your realization, you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is. Shri Ganesha is purity, the pure Spirit. He is the pure Spirit. When He is awakened within us, then we have no more problems. Then we achieve success in each and every task; every understanding gives success. And we find joy in everything we do. He is the embodiment of joy and gives joy to everyone. To serve Him is the ultimate righteousness/merit [param dharma]. To serve Him means what? To look after small children, to serve them, to protect them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them. This pleases Him very much. Such an embodiment of love, such a simple-hearted Shri Ganesha, was born today.

This is the importance of this day. Today, if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it. It is His right to fulfill all your desires, because you are all realized. Ask Him from all your heart, and He will help you in every way, every moment, and every instant.

Today is a very big day, because verily the pure Spirit itself has taken birth today. And He already had such a spiritual, eternal state that many people could not comprehend it or write about it. Many people didn’t tell anything; they wrote only what they could understand. But you can understand that just by Shri Ganesha’s name you get your realization. Just by taking His name, any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us. When you get your realization, you can feel His presence.

And if you are not realized, you cannot understand. That is why people get misled and do wrong things. But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings, you can do so many things, and you won’t feel lethargic nor have any problems, because He does all the work for you.

He takes care of you. Though He is a little boy, He looks after you. It’s a tremendous power. By Shri Ganesha’s power, several works are manifested. For Me, He is the purest ever and My own. I trouble Him a lot. When somebody tries to trouble Me, I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him all right. When this fellow is not manageable by Me, when there is a difficult person and it is not possible for Me to handle him, then He does the job.

So today is very auspicious, as He was born this day. Secondly, today is Panchami [the fifth day). This Panchami is recognized because on this day we wear special clothes. Whatever we wear is so that our body is properly covered. The sense of chastity that our body has is because of Him: Lajja Rupena Samsthita [the one who resides in the form of bashful modesty]. So if you have any sense of chastity, it is because of Him. That will benefit you immensely.

You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha. By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases. You become joyous, because He is the personification of joy [anand swaroop]. Because of this, we have both things today: His birthday and His help. We seek His help in any work we do. Such is our way. But we don’t see what we do to awaken Him. Our attention does not go in that direction. That we should also do something, that we should also develop our state, that we should have a state in which Shri Ganesha is awakened within us, through which we may never venture on the wrong path.

Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special. They despise all the wrong things in this world, and they do not do anything wrong, because Shri Ganesha stops them. They cannot enjoy wrong activities. This is Shri Ganesha’s great blessing, that you have entered a new, joyous life. So today in His service, sing His praise and glory, so that He may be pleased.

My eternal blessings to all of you.
