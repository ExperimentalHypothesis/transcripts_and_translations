Talk To Scientists, Leningrad (Russia), June 28th, 1990

One electromagnetic energy that you have. What we call as a "Prana" is the energy from 5 elements. It has energy by which we are today human beings from amoeba and it has the energy which creates desires. It has the energy that can cure and it redeems us and it can (audio not clear Text_1:be/the) energy that can give us powers so we can (audio not clear Text_1: do living work/world). Sahaja yoga is with that energy which is in totality complete consciousness, and it is a special time (audio not clear Text_1: today) this is you can say in modern times, and there are so many people who are trying to think beyond, we can say it is meta modern era,(Shri Mataji correcting Interpreter na.. na.. Meta Modern Era) and that is something which shows the wisdom of people to understand that we have to go beyond and they are not satisfied with what they are but they have to go beyond and there are so many who feel that their awareness is to be expanded. In this short time ah (audio not clear Text_1:...possible) I am trying to give you a general picture about Sahaja yoga. "Sah" means "with", and "ja" is born, so it is born with you, you have this union with that all-pervading power, (audio not clear Text_1: inside/slight) you have. It works on all living beings and also on energies, for example you can improve your agriculture in Sahajayoga [audio not very clear: Text_1: many times before], you can improve your ecological problem through Sahaja yoga, you can make your animals much more healthier through Sahaja yoga and you yourself become so dynamic and so compassionate that a scientist becomes a person who works only with all the understanding of limitations of science and helps to create a new world. I must say all the scientific discoveries have helped Sahajayoga greatly. Supposing there were no aeroplanes I did not have come to see you if there were no ah.. microphones I could not have talked to you and these microphones also carry vibrations. Even on television one can give realization to people. So all these discoveries you have made has been of such a great help to Sahaja yoga. We have developed the watches to save time, we save our time to waste it mostly, and after self-realization, we use it for our spiritual ascent and spiritual growth, growth through meditation. So I am very much thankful to you all scientist for making these devices which have made it possible to spread Sahajayoga all over the world. The knowledge of Sahajayoga is very deep, our civilization has grown like a big tree, but knowledge of Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of the roots and if you do not have the knowledge of the roots this strange development will be one day under a shock so it is important for us to know the knowledge of the roots if we have [to] survive and to enjoy the blessings of science. I am sorry in this short time I cannot say much but I will be very happy to answer your questions if you have any.

Shri Mataji bowing to seekers...Claps from the audience...

(One seeker asked a question in Russian)

Shri Mataji: As a scientist, you have to understand everything whatever you do, if somebody cures and cannot [audio not clear Text_1: expect alms] then you should not upset as a scientist? but [audio not clear Text_1: I know that] what happens ah...this is something which is not dealt with by scientists so far, only in the scriptures they have talked about the soul, now soul, whatever I tell you again, you should accept it as a hypothesis. Now soul is a composition of five elements..ah..the causal of 5 elements...which is placed on the back side of our(Shri Mataji raising her hand and pointing behind the forehead),it's an energy form, it's an energy form...and is placed on the backside of our spinal cord in seven loops...after self-realization you can even say..see..the all-pervading power as small commas shining like light, also you see a kind of loops ah.. circular things [audio not clear] and the Sahajayogis ask me what is ah..What is this..I told them these are dead souls. Now for example we talk of psychosomatic diseases, also doctors have reached a certain point of understanding that most of the psychosomatic diseases are caused by something that comes from our collective subconsciousness.For example, cancer they say is triggered by a protein 53 F 58 it's a name.(Shri Mataji again explaining Interpreter cancer is triggered by protein 53 F 58).And they say that it comes from the area which is built within us since our creation, now this area which is built within us is the area which we call as collective subconsciousness, so all the plants which have gone out of the circulation of evolution or [audio not clear Text_1:their breed] who have gone out of the circulation are all existing in that area of collective subconsciousness, so when a person who practices what we call as black magic or mesmerism also uses the dead souls which are around to captivate you. And people do mesmerize without knowing what effects it will have on human beings. Now what happens that if you put any such spirit, it can be without the knowledge of the person who is doing it or met him it becomes like a big [audio not clear] and then the spirit gets out your system, now recently they have found out in the science, scientific research that we have all got receptors and in the receptors these seven loops that I am telling you about are reflected exactly the same way I have seen..if you have seen the picture in the same that you see. And when there are on these loops if there is any effect then what you call as dopamine is created. Dopamine is a kind of a chemical which gives you epilepsy, it can give you madness can give you all mental problems also other virus and cancer, psychosomatic. So I, I didn't know that I'll talk to scientists otherwise I would have brought these papers which I have got from America. So we had about 10 people yesterday, who came from the same gentleman and were suffering from many diseases. Some had their hands stuck like that (Shri Mataji showing both hands joint) they couldn't walk, some children have been stopped talking, some got their eyes completely scooped in, some got the brain paralysis. So what happens that you can put one of their or many of these dead spirits on your back on the soul, and they take over (Shri Mataji explaining to Interpreter and they take over )and when they take over when they try to assert their personality, so for the time being one may feel elated because there are so many personalities acting for a while, but after sometime that person becomes exhausted and (audio not clear Text_1: a recluse).This is followed by many false gurus in India, we know about it very well because just this black magic is too much in India. But mainly what one has to know, I would say that as a mother I would say what did you get out of it. Only temporary curing is not the aim of life, but you have to be empowered and you have to have full knowledge as to what you are going to be. In Sahajayoga you know all about the centres and it can [audio not clear Text_1: cure you]. You can even see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the kundalini, this power which connects you to the mains. You can see also sometimes the rising of the kundalini you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, the actualization of it, and you can feel the all-pervading power. You may be a doctor may not be a doctor but you can [audio not clear Text_1:give diagnosis yourself ] what centres are in trouble. There are three channels which look after the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system, and you can control them, you can control your parasympathetic nervous system, you can raise the kundalini of others, you can cure others, yourself you feel extremely peaceful, joyous and [audio not clear Text_1:happy], because you develop a new dimension of collective consciousness which [audio not clear]. So you become complete knowledgeable like a laboratory you know everything, it is not just ah..it is happening..I don't know..how happening..nothing of that kind..everything can be explained, everything becomes logic, so anything that just cures you is not sufficient, in India this art is very well developed but we know about it so much that we now don't go to any false people, so now they are exported all to America,[audio not clear Text_1: they are very gullible], Americans are very gullible people, and these people have only interest in money they are money makers. Now it's a living process, how can you pay for a living process, how much do we pay to mother earth for sprouting a seed? These people have all their interest in money, and not in giving you the powers and the knowledge because they haven't got it. So first of all you must see (audio not clear Text_1 : what are the disciples like) [audio not clear Text_1:what they are doing] what sort of ah..what sort of body they have, how do they talk, what is their health, do they know about all this, can they explain it, how is their own [audio not clear Text_1: light] you can find out. They have to be honest and they have to be compassionate, so be careful, so many will come once you have lots of money, there will be a market, so before anything happen to be careful. I am a mother and you have asked me the question I have to tell you the truth. Eighteen years back I have told this truth but they would not listen to me, in America I told them about AIDS, I told them about [audio not clear Text_1: hippies / Herpes] diseases to come, I told them about so many diseases they would not listen and now they are down with it. So what can you do if they don't want to listen to you, can't help it? If they are bent upon their destruction then what can you do, you are not a figure, or somebody asked me how to go to hell, (Shri Mataji explains to Interpreter hell, hell) all types of questions they ask, I said take two running jumps and you are there.
So it is like this, forgetting your realization you have to first ask for it, I respect your freedom and it's not a guarantee that you will get it at first shot. But if you are earnest it will (audio not clear Text_1: come down) and then once you are fully connected no problems of any kind. I found Russians to be very wise people, and I feel that a day will come when Russians will be most powerful people spiritually. The country is not powerful by weapons but by the powerful peoples [audio not clear Text_1: Thank you very much].

Audience claps... The interpreter speaks something in Russian... more claps and Shri Mataji smiling... one person from the audience walks up to Shri Mataji and tells something.

Shri Mataji: I have to [audio not clear Text_1: just a minute].. his question is still not answered [audio not clear]. After realization, we become very sensible and satisfied people, and we develop a balance then we realize that the machines are for us and we are not for machines so we produce as much as we want, and whatever is necessary we produce through machines or we produce through our hands. So a balance is[audio not clear Text_1: maintained].As a result of that, the pollution goes down. Now in Spain there are five motor factories (Interpreter recheck with Shri Mataji..Shri Mataji replies 5 motor..audio not clear), now on the road you will find in car only one person is sitting, in a big car, because so many cars are produced every day, cars are cheap so they buy a car and an ego is arrived not a car. The father must have one car, mother must have one car, the child must have one car, the grandmother must have one car and they never meet each other, no response no relationship, they live with their cars with their [audio not clear] and with [audio not clear Text_1: Suitcase]. So, after realization we become collective, there may be three cars but everybody would like to go together in one car, they want to live collectively because they enjoy each other. Now Sahaja yoga is working in forty nations, and they are gone to live in Indian villages,( Interpreter checks something with Shri Mataji)....and [audio not clear].........I mean you cannot do anything there, but they enjoy it having their baths in the flowing rivers and living in nature absolutely very happy and comfortable. Ah. They wear few clothes of cotton or pure silk or cotton whatever they can afford, not too many things they don't have in their (audio not clear Text_1:heart/house) like plastics, mountains and mountains and they don't know how to destroy it, and Sahajayogis don't drink, so only one glass is sufficient for one man, for drinking we have to have one(audio not clear), another one, another one, another one, and too many choices because of ego. In the morning the mother will ask what will you have, one child will say this, another this another that, and if that is not in the fridge the child will start shouting,(audio not clear Text_1: Formerly/Normally) the mother used to cook for everyone the same thing and everybody have/had to eat that and enjoy it, because we have lost our collective enjoyment, we have become like this. Now these entrepreneurs are also making fool of us, first they will start that you should wear very tight pants, so you develop a cold veins, so they will say alright make pants with holes in it (Shri Mataji repeats to Interpreter, pants with holes), so everybody starts wearing it, they go on changing fashions because their machines have to run, and we have no personality, we all want to be fashionable, what is the need. So we have piles of clothes, you go to an English home, as soon as you enter all pile will fall on you first of all. So, this matter is only for one purpose, is for expressing your love, like today we had a birthday, so we gave him a tea set, and I got some necklaces for all of you, and I enjoy very much giving them, that's the only advantage of (audio not clear Text_1: Matter), otherwise possessions are headaches. So, how ecological problems have come by ( audio not clear Text_1: because of greed and lust). After Sahaja yoga, you get everything beautiful and enjoy everything, because you feel that this has become a holy water now (audio not clear), everything becomes holy, auspicious, only thing which is auspicious, which emit vibrations Sahajayogis will have it, all auspicious things are benevolent so the ecological problem is solved.

Audience claps...

Shri Mataji drinks some water and a lady from the audience comes forward and asks a question in Russian...The interpreter tells question to Shri Mataji without a microphone. The lady further asks something more and Shri Mataji and the audience laughs.

(Which diseases can be cured through Sahajayoga)..

So one question is that (Audi not clear Text_1: which diseases can be cured through Sahajayoga after raising of the kundalini). (Audio not clear..but in Russian it is fine). Yesterday there was a lady and (audio not clear Text_1: and she could not stand on her..) and we raised her kundalini, she had problems on her centres, we connected the centres raised her kundalini gave her realization and she got alright, and then ah she (audio not clear) that she was sick so she was holding onto the chair and I said now you get up and walk, and she then started walking so fast, everybody saw. Most of them get cured, but some of them do not.

Shri Mataji looking into the audience for another question...The interpreter speaks something to Shri Mataji...

Shri Mataji: Now, first of all, you have to get your self-realization, then you have to come for collective program and then you have to master Sahajayoga(audio not clear Text_1: then I believe)..then you can cure others. But Sahaja yoga is not for curing, it is for self-realization and when you get your self-realization and a byproduct then you can cure (audio not clear) because when the kundalini rises it passes through the centre and nourishes them.

Shri Mataji showing hand to audience and looking for another question..speaking to Interpreter. another lady comes from the audience and asks Shri Mataji question in Russian...one more person from the audience asks a question to Shri Mataji in Russian.
The interpreter explains the question to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji looks at the audience and smiles.

Shri Mataji: (audio not clear) is accepted for the descend but if you won't do it otherwise you can do it by using ah Sahajayoga methods to cure people who are suffering from ah psychosomatic diseases or depressions or anything ah by ah treating them and then noting down their improvements.

Shri Mataji helps Interpreter with switching on the microphone.

One person from the audience asks some question in Russian. Interpreter explains question to Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: (audio not clear Text_1:We have here a saint so I took his England ah which is here and it can tell you about it and they are all experimenting with meditates is he a doctor?) (Shri Mataji asks question to audience and someone replies in Russian) alright, you come and see he is now running seven hospitals, London. Now we have ah many doctors here and err I feel we should meet them who have come from abroad..(audio not clear).Ah..(Shri Mataji points towards audience ah.. "aap aaiye( you please come)", You are doctor Talwar? Haan(Yes)..Dr. Talwar? Dr Talwar from Delhi. Now we have Dr Amzad Ali,(Shri Mataji points towards the audience, Interpreter reconfirms the name with Shri Mataji), he is from the U.K. and he is a big student of medicines actually. (Shri Mataji smiling) he has done a lot of studies in (audio not clear Text_1: India). Then we have Dr Neelam,(audio not clear Text_1: from India) (audience claps..all three doctors stand up in audience). Then we have Dr Sarah,(audience claps)then we have got a diplomat from UN,(Diplomat name not clear Text_1: Diplomat Gregoir). Then from Russia, we have got Dr Bugnolt(spelling needs correction). Today is his Birthday. (more claps from the audience). He has sacrificed his job, an Indian and he is nowhere, working it out for Russia. You have to see some sense of scientists also for you. (audio not clear), they'll explain many more things for you, also we will send you some papers that they have made for you.
(Audience claps)(one person comes from the audience and asks Shri Mataji one question in Russian).

.Interpreter explains: How did you go to Sahaja yoga (audio, not clear Text_1: it was his 1st question).. then whether it instantly did you gone (audio not clear Text_1: on silent) or in the...(Interpreter continue to explain the question to Shri Mataji ..no audio)

Shri Mataji: Please be seated..Ah...I should say I was born with this knowledge. (audience claps).ah..the second question is about all other yogas.Now Hath yoga is meaning "Ha" and "Tha" meaning ah the ah sun and the moon both lines both energies, but in modern times the Hath yoga they are practising is only of one side, moreover the one who started hath yoga was known as Patanjali (Interpreter reconfirms and Shri Mataji says Patanjali),so thousands of years back he's written a book so big as that so thick( Shri Mataji shows thickness by hand), in that he has written that there are Ashtanga, there are eightfold of yoga, eight aspects, spiritual paths, out of that yama niyama is the one which is just a wee bit,(translator confirms with Shri Mataji, yama niyama, (audio not clear Text_1: control and the laws)) and out of that very wee bit are the exercises, now we also use those exercises, but later on throughout he has talked about Sahaja yoga, first you get thoughtless awareness and then doubtless awareness. In those days there used to only ah.. have one or two disciples, and you test their all centers and then raise their kundalini, and it could take years together. But now in the Sahajayoga today, I have evolved a method by which first you raise the Kundalini somehow, and in that little light, give them little light they see what's the problem with that and just tell them how to correct so they can correct their own problems. In those days people have no time and people were very obstinate also so now supposing there's darkness and you are holding the snake in your hand and I say now you gets a snake in your hand, you won't listen to me, you won't throw it away till it bites you. You will say it's a rope, so the best thing is to put little light, so you see the snake and throw it away from yourself. This is today's Shajayoga but it's the same what he achieved after so many years you can achieve it yourself in a very short time, and also as we have developed speed I think kundalini has also developed speed. We call it this as jet times and the kundalini is also a jet kundalini,(Shri Mataji explaining to Interpreter, we call it as a jet, Jet Times, jet, J E T) (audio not clear Text_1: How do you translate this)
(Someone from the audience tries to explain in Russian, Shri Mataji says jet and raises her hand and say (audio not clear Text_1: it will be Jet). I am myself surprised, it works en masse. Yesterday there were 10,000 people, and I feel 95% of people got realization 95. But we do telling exercises when the kundalini rises, then we tell you if there is any physical problem what exercises to be done, it's (audio not clear) all scientific. But this way these days the way people do hath yoga, they just take all the medicine from the medicine box without knowing what is to be taken without discretion. Now another is Rajyoga. I went down to California and I saw some doctors whom I knew have cut their (audio not clear Text_1: this) below the tongue, and they told me that they had to cut it to do a thing called "khechari" to take back the tongue to raise the kundalini. So now when the kundalini rises it is like the ignition of a car, and when the car is ignited all the machinery works by itself, you don't have to do anything. So what they do is to put back the tongue thinking by doing that the kundalini will rise, and poor things now can't speak can't eat very difficult, so it is like moving the wheels without starting the car, will it move?. It's all artificial, nobody gets realization (audio not clear Text_1: in/like) that because it's a living process, now there's integral ah.. yoga, that is all mental. Talking about yoga how can it gets realization, supposing if it talks to the mother earth will she give us flowers. Talk..talk..talk..talk..talk..that's all. People get fed up (audio not clear Text_1: with this) talks, books after books like this so many. So far I have not written any book for the same reason, then we have another one you call them one is (audio not clear Text_1: stars/stylish) Gentleman, that is the worst tell you (Interpreter checks with Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji repeats worst that is the worst) (one lady prompts from the audience). We had four people from transcendental, the man was the director of a flying foundation in Scotland, to get a mantra and the mantras were told in secret and the mantras were rare, funny ones "Inga, Pinga, Thinga", it has no meaning, it is not Sanskrit, it has no meaning but it has funny meaning also so, Inga means the scorpion's (audio not clear Text_1: bite/poison) (Interpreter confirm with Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji again tells scorpion's bite/poison) and Pinga means when you get possessed you go round and round like that, that is Pinga and Thinga means when you show(Shri Mataji showing her right-hand thumb with fingers closed) like this to someone, 300 pounds for that, and 6000 pounds for flying halfway. What a stupidity, what is the need to fly halfway you already have traffic jams, then they were given to drink the water which boiled ah.. which boiled potatoes for six days alright then the(audio not clear Text_1: rims/rings) of potato (audio not clear Text_1: rims/rings), and the last day was given the potatoes to eat. But this director, his wife, his daughter and a deputy director all got epilepsy, so they came here. Luckily my husband has gone on a tour so they stayed in my house and with my treatment they got cured. They had lost all their money, this man was a diamond merchant, he had lost all his money his wife was a granddaughter of a Duke, she has lost everything. 

Shri Mataji Pointing towards a lady on her right and talking to Interpreter: What is this lady...please tell her to sit down

Shri Mataji again continues to talk: and the and it a granddaughter who was the granddaughter of a Duke and this man became bankrupt. (Interpreter explaining something to Shri Mataji in Russian) ah.. so and the director and the deputy director became bankrupts and he is now gone to South Africa like (audio not clear). The name of the book is "How we were befooled" (Shri Mataji and Interpreter laughing). This is (audio not clear) and now they begin in Ayurveda(Shri Mataji explaining (audio not clear) Ayurveda to Interpreter).Ya, they are marketing it now marketing it, there is no need for them to market anybody can take to Ayurveda, but for Ayurveda, you cannot do it here, you have to go to India because the herbs that are used for curing, you cannot grow here. So, just that just trying to I don't know what are they have (audio not clear Text_1: to/grow) I just don't know, they can't bring Ayurveda here.

One person from the audience asks about Ayurveda medicines.

Shri Mataji: India, Indian medicine, I mean it is a common sense everybody knows in India that you can't do Ayurveda anywhere else but in India. I think they will now give ah.. some sort of this you got in the name of Ayurveda (audio not clear Text_1: and they buy) or they (audio not clear Text_1: give) may be some water which has boiled the potatoes. Once you know of this thing there's another one who gives diabetes..(audio not clear), only the people who are very big cheats in India (Interpreter confirms with Shri Mataji and Shri Mataji says the Horrible people who (audio not clear) they are cheats, if he is so good why doesn't he solves our problem financial problem in India(Interpreter confirms with Shri Mataji says why doesn't (audio not clear Text_1: he) solves our financial problem).All these people (audio not clear Text_1: will get) heart, heart trouble. I am telling you everything frankly, they will never talk against each other. Christ has said that the house of Satan will never speak against itself. (audio not clear)..but they will speak against me ah.. they do.

Shri Mataji checks the microphone of Interpreter and blows into it. Shri Mataji checks her own microphone and says (audio not clear Text_1: they may like that) Interpreter says yes..yes.

Shri Mataji: They may speak against me and tell you that I must be a dark ah..force or something, they might, but it is their business, they will be using money when I am here.

Shri Mataji looks at audience smiles and says Alright, Thank you very much.
(Audience claps..)
