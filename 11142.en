Is it heard behind, no? Ask them to come forward.

I have told you that the human body, his mind, his wisdom, etc, all his personality whatever he has is made up of three kinds of powers.

One power or energy which gives us our existence in this world, it resides in the human being as Pran [Vital power] and its place is in our hearts. The other power which is in our stomach by which we have evolved up to the level of human being is "Dharma" and the third power which is full of awareness by which we have achieved the support of our consciousness in many ways.

But all these three powers are found in The All Pervading Divine Love of God Almighty. This all pervading power of Divine Love of God Almighty activates all these three powers and integrates them.

For example in the inert object [Jada vastu] in that also you see vibrations which you call "Electromagnetic Vibrations". Even that also is the form of Pran [vitality] but it is in the state of sleep. But when it is awakened then it becomes Pran [mobile].

That which is in a very tiny amoeba, is in the stomach and cause starvation in human being is awakened in the form of "Dharma". Dharma is in everything. As I have said that the Dharma of gold is not that because it is Yellow in color. Its dharma is even not that you can make ornaments from it. But its dharma [quality] is that in no circumstances it gets tarnished. It does not get spoiled.

Now the third thing is the Awareness or Consciousness which is much more developed in the minds of the human being.

Man has now become completely mature in all these three powers. He has developed and become prepared with all these three powers to know the one power which is the Love of God and know the Love of God. This one power of God has been divided into these three powers and let it become one with it.

Within us resides a great part of that Absolute Power of God in the form of Kundalini sleeping in the triangular bone.

When any such person who has achieved within himself this power of Love of God and in whom this power is completely integrated and flowing means he has become a "Realized Soul" then he can awaken the Kundalini of a Sadhak [child]. So Kundalini being your mother is awakened in you.

But a seeker "Kundalini" then it is same as somebody not knowing driving bullock cart is driving the motor car. So if someone who does not know to drive motor car drives motor car then the car will smash and break it into pieces. In the same way those people who want to awaken their own Kundalini, they will completely destroy the instrument of their own Kundalini. If anybody who has no knowledge wants to awaken Kundalini then also the same thing happens. If an impure person comes towards your mother Kundalini and wants to awaken Her then also the same thing happens. And anybody for the sake of money, and to loot you by making fool of puts his hand on your Kundalini then it also results into the same thing.So the person who is filled with the Love of God and in whom the collective consciousness is flowing completely is empowered to do this work to send invitation to Kundalini to be awakened. Invitations to Kundalini cannot be sent by such a person who is engaged in obscure practices and they become great sinners. Those who spoil or destroy others Kundalini, then their own Kundalini is destroyed for ages and they take births in the form of all kinds of insects.

Therefore one should never dare to play with Kundalini. In other things it is all right. You can do smuggling, stealing and take all things of the world, that does not matter. But you must please keep yourself away in the matters of Kundalini. Nobody can give authority to awaken Kundalini except God Almighty.

As long as the Shakti of God Herself does not give you the authority, till then you do not have any authority that you can go to any college and get a degree and say that you can awaken Kundalini. This kind of false people are seen in large numbers in the world nowadays and they are not knowing that they are committing extremely grave and fearful sins.

The work of Kundalini has to be done with great aptitude and care, only this, but with absolutely pure love. The purity is the power permeated completely with dharma. The person who is not pure and whose attention is full of obscene thoughts and engaged in grabbing others money or wives and are always in looting spree, such person should spend his time in some other activities but never try to lay hands on Kundalini. Kundalini is as much innocence and soft, compassionate, bestower of the best and Her heart flows with motherly love but Her Sustainer and protector Deities are extremely powerful and equipped. If any kind of immoral acts are committed against Kundalini then they are always ready to protect Her and they destroy those people who do such sins against Her.

The greatest sin in the world is to awaken Kudalini of any seeker [Sadhak] without any authority. There is no greater sin in the world than this. It is even greater than the murder of one's own mother that you are laying hands on somebody's Kundalini without any authority.God has created the whole creation with His Divine Love and has filled it with purity. The whole creation is absolutely pure. In that whatever is impure, low quality and bad has been made by man only. Because man is such a living being who has been created with freedom. Rest of the creation dance and act according to the desire of God. Not a single leaf of a tree move without His dictates.In the whole creation that which is meaner than the meanest, is hell and the greatest hell and sin and the greatest sin all that have been created by man. It is created by man only. And such mean people when they reach the meanest state then they move in the form of Satan.

God has not created Satan. Man has made Satan and they worship Satan because they have created him. As long as we do not call a Satan as "Satan", say adharm as "adharm", say badness as "badness", till then goodness will not be awakened.

You might have heard that when people go to Mecca, there they see on the way a statue of a "Satan" and all the people from their house take their old shoes [chappal] and first they beat the "Satan" means they curse him. Without cursing him God will not accept you and without His acceptance, you will not get anything. Whatever you may do you must have His blessings. You must have His mercy. His love must be poured on you. He is extremely merciful, compassionate, omnipotent, Lord God Almighty.

But if you are committing gravest crimes and worshipping Satan who moved the wheel of adharma in world and many many of his followers are born in this world and doing his work and as long as you do not curse that Satan completely, you will not be blessed by God.In this matter if you have half-heartedness then you are deceiving yourself. You have to completely discredit, disregard and curse Satan. You have to discord him and throw him otherwise that which is myth will continue to be seated within you and that which is truth in you will not get manifested. Then how can the truth spread in the world?

For example if the Sun is covered by clouds then darkness spread and when the clouds move away then again the Sun shines.

In the same way man has made Satan by doing meanest crimes and the clouds of that Satan is badly overcasting the whole world even today.

Then it may happen in case Sahaja Yoga is not fully grown and those days are not far that we may all be completely destroyed and fall into the abyss of darkness.But those souls who have worked hard in Sahaja Yoga absolutely will shine like stars. They will be glorified like stars. That is a very high position of yours.

Today you are not able to understand this but it will be discussed in the history of spirituality and how many Sahaja Yogis have stood firmly into the truth. Leave the idea of halfway done. There is no need to get entangled in small things. You have firmly occupied a very big position.

Such people who have occupied big positions should not divert their attention towards small small things. The power within you flows only depending on your own preparedness. If you are less prepared then the power will also show less intensity. If you are fully prepared and also you have the initiative to reject Satan then from within you only great saints and masters will emerge.

And now one great generation is going to take birth. Starting from a five year old child many newly born children and many souls have taken birth in the world as if their whole family has descended down here.

I see many children born realized but you only are the milestones.

I have already told you people many times that today all those who have raised false fights of dharmas and look at each other with hatred and in that they use the name of dharma they all are the children of Satan. They are not sent by God. God had never allowed hatred and jealousy. But He has opposed them and also destroyed them.

Those who have bound themselves into small groups and say that they are such and such special ones cannot go to the lap of the Infinity and to those who are sitting in the limitless state. You have to break your boundaries which are made out of stupidity. No religion binds you into a boundary. But those people who have made stupid religions cannot be corrected.

In fact in the world there are only two religions; one is dharma and the other is adharma.All great masters who have come here have fought for dharma and at that time those who were in adharma, with them they had fought. You can call them Muslim, Hindu or Christians. But all their followers were not true like them. They made their various small groups and started fighting among them as two adharmas or false religions. One false religion was fighting with another false religion.

In fact there is no fighting between true religions. There are no skirmishes in religions. All dharmas are one and the same within all. Only one is present in all. There is no argument in them.

When you all will put your hands towards them and tell, "Mother, we are feeling burning from this man here at Agnya Chakra", you all will say the same thing. Same thing will be told and no difference will be there. Whosoever will tell, will not say wrong.

Everybody feel the same way. When you laugh, you laugh in the same way and when you will cry then tears will fall from your eyes in the same way.

Even beyond that how many forms are the dharmas which are pervading in all and are similar within all. In that dharma there cannot be any possibility of fighting.

If there comes any kind of mutual jealousy and enmity then you can understand that one adharma is fighting with other adharma. Dharma never fights with dharma.

The person says himself a dharmik and also says another person that you are also dharmik but let us fight together then he does not understand what is dharma.

In Sahaja Yoga how the integration comes and awakening of Kundalini takes place, etc. I have already told you all that and again tell you sometime. But it is joyful to see that you yourself get this power.

Whereas the first power which is in your heart by which the Pran [vitality] becomes love and that dharma which is in your stomach becomes manifested in this whole world and the chaitanya [buddhi] which is in your head becomes the knowledge of the whole world, at that time you can know that how awakening of Kundalini takes place by movement of your hand.You know how Kundalini rises by movement of your hand and with your bandhan [making auras], how this dharma grows and dies by boundary lines drawn by you. You can see yourself if few arrows shot by you fall on, this adharma leaves its path and goes away. And Kundalini comes to Her path cleanly.

The hidden negativity in this way is totally destroyed and Kundalini rises up in the front and goes on like the Ganges brought by the king Bhagirath. To bring The Ganges Bhagirath had done tremendous efforts, and for bring Kundalini [into your awareness] I have also done many many efforts in My earlier incarnations and also in this incarnation.

Now you see its result that This Ganges is flowing at your doorsteps. Kundalini will move with your signals and you can give realization to people while going on your way. By your hands many diseases like cancer are cured and this is true and we must accept this too.

How all this happen? The reason is that you have become the weapons of the All Pervading Power of Divine Love of God Almighty. He is using you. The same power is flowing within you and you are doing the work of the same power.

Now where is the question of fighting arise? Does My this hand fights with My other hand? The day this fight begins then we will say that this hand has separated with the other one. They are not our hands at all.

In the same way when we achieve this All Pervading Power within us then we become all powerful. Many people have already got it but they were still very few people.I must say that when I read about Zen... Zen was started in the 6th century in Japan and at that time Viditamas had done the work of Kundalini awakening and about 26 people of them got realization. And by now from 3-4 century nobody has got realization.

So you can understand here thousands of people are getting their realization and many have got it. It may not happen to someone but ultimately it happens. Up till now those who come and do not get it, whosoever have come and sat here and tried to get, all have got it. It is not known so far that anybody has not got it. But one thing is that one should come prepared, that you have to shoebeat Satan. You have to recognize Satan. You have to expel Satan from your heart. And who is Satan and who is God is recognized with these "divine vibrations" only.

If you do not have it with you then listen to those who have it and know it. You listen to them who have tried and tested it. By this you will be able to know that who is Satan and who is God. Who is real Guru and who is false.

In this world, there are natural flowers in the same way plastic flowers are also there. But their recognition is done by your eyes, nose and mouth or by all means that those are plastic [artificial] and those are real flowers.

But to know the dharma you require vibrations only. Without it you will not be able to know whether this person is crafty or false or adharmik or a devil or a religious one. He is dharmik or an incarnation or is very powerful, you will not know unless and until you have divine vibrations on your hands.

Therefore you must first get this thing and real cool vibrations are coming from your hands.

Apart from this your thoughts come under your control and you become thoughtless and when you see your thoughts, then immediately you become thoughtless. No any thought is coming whenever you watch your thoughts.

Thoughtlessness, it is a reality, it is the truth that is why I do not give you false promise. I have no false recommendation to you. In this I cannot give you false statement.

As long as you are not realized, you will not become. You are not My relation anyway. May anybody offer Me any amount of money but I cannot give realization. You might be a well read, intelligent person, you sit at your home, I cannot. You all may be anybody I am helpless. I cannot give you such a false certificate. In this no falsehood can do. Any kind of falsehood cannot do anything here. This kind of truth must be in you and you must have your own experience. It should be seen by you and the flow from your hand must awaken others then only you are realized.

Yes, I will cleanse you by washing and shining. With love I will cleanse you. I will advise your Kundalini and do all things but this has to happen to you.

To whom it does not happen, say things related to mundane affairs. They create false shows but I have nothing to bother about them. You people too do not bother about them and look after your own welfare and wellbeing. With your own manpower you go ahead. Let there may two to four people maybe less or thousand maybe more will make no difference.

Now we will go into meditation. Let us all put your hands like this. In the beginning do not close your eyes.
