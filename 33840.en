Please tell them not to disturb, otherwise we will not give whatever we may consider to give. It is a custom to beg.

Yes, I was listening to some of your questions and also your answers. There is a debate on why only the mother has to do this work. So this question can be asked in two ways, this question can be asked for two reasons. One is that why does our mother have to suffer so much, the father should do all the work. And the second is that we believe only in the father, so the mother should do this work. Now the will of God is such that whoever can do the work, he hands it over to that person, who is wise. Kundalini awakening is not an easy task. Especially in Kaliyug when the worst of Kaliyug is prevailing and demonic knowledge has spread. At this time there are people who have committed great sins. They have committed countless sins in their life, in this life. And there are people who have even destroyed their Kundalini.

To explain to you, I was saying yesterday, “Do not think that I have no faults, I have no inner troubles”.Think in this way first, so that you gain self-confidence.

But you should know that today in Kaliyug, we are so deeply mired in degradation that the work of getting us out of it can only be done by a mother who has love and strength in her heart, and not only that, who is an embodiment of love to carry on this work till the very end.

Now look at Krishna, he used to get angry very quickly, if he saw that someone is a sinner and he has committed a sin, he would not let him be. He used the Sudarshan Chakra once and that was it, his head was gone. Look at Shri Ram, he liberated Ravana by killing him. Look at Christ, the cross was his ultimate limit, he hung himself on the cross.

Everyone was needed, all this work was needed, the time was such, the time was such that the work was done accordingly. Today in Kaliyug, such a person is needed who can peacefully, patiently, carefully, lovingly, put people in this boat of God. Now none of you people are unfamiliar with your mother. Secondly, the mother is the one who gives birth. When you have to give birth a second time, how can the father do it? Has the father given birth to a child anywhere? A mother is required for that too. If someone tells the mother that why should the mother give birth, the father should also give birth. Will he give birth? This task has to be done by the mother only and it is only the mother who can bear the child in the womb for nine months and it is she who can nurture the child after giving birth and even if the child grows up and berates her, she still keeps blessing the child.

Perhaps due to the influence of Muslims, people here have come to believe that a man is superior and a woman is inferior. No one is superior or inferior. The power that runs the fan is very important and the fan is also important. Actually, the thing is that now the power wants to become the fan and the fan wants to be the power. Whoever has a job to do, he has to do that.

This is nothing, in foreign countries people say, “Mother, why do you do it?” So I said, "Son, you come and do it!" I am doing this useless work, which is called a thankless job. What benefit do I get from it? You do it, you can do it, you do it.

So this question has only another meaning, I can understand from a mother's point of view, that the children have a lot of compassion and love for me and they think why should the mother work so hard? The father should do it. But if the father cannot do the work that the mother can do, then let the mother do it, what is the harm in that?

Do you tell your father to cook food? You will die of hunger in four days. And in this country where we know our mother and recognize the importance of mother, such a question should not arise.

And what was the last question asked?

Yogi - Some people, during meditation, ...

Thoughtless.

Yogi - Tears come out of the eyes.

Yes, when your eyes are watering it is not a bad thing because there are a lot of suppressed emotions inside you, where you were supposed to get love, but you did not get it.

You are sad, look, a man always cries in front of his mother. Whether he shows it or not.

You must have heard about Lal Bahadur Shastri that he was a great devotee of his mother.

And every day he would wake up at four in the morning and switch off all the lights so that the government lights are not wasted. After that he would go into his mother's bed and sleep for a while and take his mother's blessings. His mother was also a highly evolved lady.

Every man who rises very high has either his wife or his mother behind him, but when the woman tries to run ahead of the man, then trouble arises.

In Sahaja Yoga the place of a woman and a man are different.

Can you get him a chair if he can't sit down?

No, okay, get him a chair if he can't sit down. Yes.

So everyone has a different place. It is not that a woman will become a man and a man will become a woman. The education we had earlier was that a woman is in a woman's place and a man is in a man's place.

‘Where women are worshiped, there gods reside.’ Women should be worshipped, but a woman should also be worthy of worship. Then in this Rajasthan where there are women like Padmini, what are you people talking about? There have been many Rajput women in your history. Have you people forgotten everything? What did Rana Pratap's wife teach him? We have many wonderful women here. There are so many great stories about the Rajputs and their wives in the world. Where there are so many women who have achieved great glory, what are you questioning about them? It is because of the influence of Muslims that you people must be saying this. I don't understand anything else.

People who live in Rajputana, Rajasthan will not ask this. Yes, there are people from outside Punjab, they are very much influenced by Muslims, people from Sindh, they are exactly like this. But, people of Rajasthan know their history, have you forgotten your history? Were not (women) considered as Kshatrani.

Well, tell me!

Well then, ask about thoughtlessness.

Being thoughtless means that the thoughts that arise in us, one arises, another falls, rises, falls. We may see the falling of the other, but we cannot see the rising of the other. There is a space between these two thoughts, which is called vilamba in Sanskrit. We keep jumping on the peak of these thoughts. So either we think about the next, or we think about the previous, we think about the past or we think about the future.

Neither the past remains now, it has ended and the future is not in front of us. Whatever is there is the present. Today, right now, at this moment, this time.

We cannot stand at this moment and whatever is to be known, can be known completely at this moment but when our attention is not focused on this moment, when our mind is not focused on this moment, then how can we know? Because our mind is divided, it is either in the past or in the future. At this time if we say that you should stop your mind, you cannot stop it.

When the Kundalini awakening happens, your mind stops at this place of delay between thoughts. That is why you become thoughtless. You can think if you want to. But now the thoughts that you will think will be motivating and inspiring. Because it will have the light of the soul.

Now you are sitting in front of us, understand. Leave our words aside, but you people who have come here, you can also tell where your Kundalini is blocked, where is your Kundalini sitting, why is it not awakening.

You yourself do not know anything about yourself. They can tell you about your Chakras, and they can tell you about their own Chakras. Like some gentleman came and told me, a Sahaja Yogi, that mother, my Agnya Chakra is stuck, the front Agnya is getting stuck. This means, the ego has increased inside me. But if you tell someone like this that your ego has increased a lot, then he will rush to beat you.

If he is really arrogant, he will beat even more. But, just when you can see the stains inside yourself, if I see the stains inside my sari, then I would not want my sari to remain dirty. I will wash it. If I cannot see at all, I am sitting in darkness, then I would not want anyone to say that there is a stain inside you. This is today's Sahaja Yoga, that first of all awakens the Kundalini. Yes, keep cleaning, clean each chakra, do this, do that. It has been going on for so many years. I said, let's first awaken everyone, then in that glowing light, you must see which flaw is inside you. You will correct your faults yourself. If you are holding a snake in your hand, no matter how much you tell it, you will not let it go.

Okay, give it a little light and the snake will go away on its own. Now in foreign lands, you know how many people take drugs etc. How did it happen that they got rid of all this overnight?

Today they are free from it, tomorrow they are clean. Because they have a strong desire to rise towards God. The lower the state, the more strongly they want to rise towards God. And we are walking on the upward path, but we jump in both directions. We go downward as well as upward. We take the name of God, and then start abusing. Those people do not take the name of God, they do not know God, they do not know the Mother, they have gone into degradation. Now knowing that they are in a degraded state, they try our best to get out of it. And if they get a little helping hand, they are pulled up, because they also try.

But the people of our country, India, do not put in this much hard work. The hard work that these people can put in, we do not put in that much hard work. Many will get realization. You will see, today all of them will become realised, but to get settled is a difficult task, because the kind of faith that should be there for that and the respect that should be there for one's own self-realization is not there. That is why Buddha said that after having self-realization, it is good if everyone becomes a sanyasi.

Otherwise my attention gets divided on my wife, my child, my house, my brother, so and so, so and so.

But because Mother is sitting in front, she keeps watching everything. Come on brother, your mother is ill, let me cure her too, he is my father,  fix him, let's fix the relationship, let's fix the marriage issue, let's fix this, let's fix that. Everything is going on simultaneously.

But the thing we are considering very small is actually something very big. Today, if you look around, there is so much chaos across the entire creation. God created such a beautiful world and man has ruined it so much. No one has any happiness or joy anywhere.

So the time has come today, that if we do not find our divinity, our divine power, then it is a matter of doom. It is a matter of doom. It is a matter of uplifting the entire human race of the world, you will have to work hard in it, you will have to make yourself, you will have to flourish in it.

Only then will the work be done.

And you will be surprised that the responsibility of this, the responsibility of this, is on you Indian people.

The responsibility of science is definitely on them, but the responsibility of the science of God, is on you people, you people will have to become aware about this, about the knowledge of this.

And we have to understand, what is this knowledge of the roots? It came to our country in a secret form from time immemorial, it should be said that it was first narrated by Adi Shankaracharya.

But Markandeya, etc., all have said a lot about Kundalini. But where do we read Markandeya? Even if we read Shankaracharya—he’ll write one thing, say another, and something else will be interpreted. This is the kind of situation I see in the books. No one has understood them properly, has written about them, and everyone uses them to make money, Not to establish humanity (dharma), and not to make a great human. You people have to become great humans, for that you should just accept with humility, your own wealth. This is your own wealth, you should accept it with due humility.

Now if you have any questions, please ask.

And...

This evening I am going to tell you about the chakras, one by one about each chakra. You should learn what a chakra is.

When you admit any student in school, he looks at you as a curious person, thinking what all do I need to know, I don't know anything yet.

Now the respected Doctor, was telling you that he went to many Gurus but he did not learn anything. And this is what you need to know, this is what Shri Krishna has told you in the beginning that you should acquire knowledge. In devotion also....

Today I am going to tell you about the politics of Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna lives in our brain, he is the brain of the whole universe. He is very clever and intelligent, all the cleverness of the world comes from him. And his cleverness is that he understood that things will not enter their brains easily. So you will have to extract ghee by twisting your fingers. But to understand that also, until you have self-realization, you will not be able to understand Krishna also because he is complicated. But mother would clearly say what Krishna was saying. When he told you to do devotion, he said, "patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam" — I accept everything. And at the time of giving, he tricked you on one word, but you must do exclusive devotion. The word "ananya", nowadays anyone who understands Sanskrit knows — when there is no second. Meaning, do devotion after self-realization, he clearly said it. He was not a shopkeeper, so he told a good thing beforehand, to acquire knowledge.

Knowledge does not mean reading and writing. Have you heard of someone becoming a self-realized soul by reading and writing? Instead, he becomes angry. So he said that you should acquire knowledge, which means knowing God in your nerves, which is called the central nervous system. This is ‘Vid’, from this the word ‘Veda’ has come. This is knowledge. God has to be known on your fingertips, this is what Muhammad Saheb has said. When the time of upliftment, resurrection, comes, then your fingers will speak, this is what Muhammad Saheb has said.

At first Shri Krishna also said the same thing, confusing everyone, with ‘exclusive’ devotion. And for duty, again confused you, said do all the work and surrender at God’s feet. This cannot happen, it is a matter of befooling. It cannot happen as long as there is ego inside you, whenever you do any work, you will think that it is you who is doing it.

But when you will transcend it, then what will you say, “That this is happening Ma, it is happening, it is happening, it is not happening to them.” You don't say that I am doing it. You don't say that I am raising the Kundalini. You say that it is not rising, then the conversation starts in the third person. "You are the one, you are the one, you are the one", what Kabir has said, this begins.

Until your kundalini is awakened, you just cannot attribute the result of your actions (karma) on God, you cannot put it, but after the Kundalini awakening, you do just that. It is impossible to say anything else.

Now if it is not happening to a person, then say, “Brother, it is not happening, what should I do, this person has this problem, that person has that problem, there must be some sinful deeds, there must be some other problem, there must be some issue.”

Now you can even say, “This Chakra is catching, that Chakra is catching, this will happen.” But you will not say that I am doing it, the ‘I’ has been left out. Nanak says, without realising the self, no confusion can be dispelled.

Now they are memorizing, doing continuous recitation, are you reciting what is written in it? That non-stop reading of Ramayana is going on, continuous reading of Guru Charitra takes place in Maharashtra, it keeps happening continuously. It would be good if some small portions are read. Man should at least think about what is written in it, “What am I reading?”

God cannot be found by rote learning like this.

Same is the case with worship and rituals. You see, those who worship are so short-tempered, may God save them. The day someone observes a fast dedicated to Hanuman Ji, one should run away from them — Hanuman Ji descends upon them that day. Though Hanuman Ji is so compassionate and so beautiful, may God protect us from the people who sing his praises.  So our children ask, what is the benefit of such a God, why do you believe in such a God, where you are just offering money to Brahmins, there is no other benefit. We have to prove to them that when we know God, there is a change from within, there should be a transformation.

In our country, a bird is called ‘Dwij’, and a Brahmin is called ‘Dwij’, the one who knows Brahma is a Brahmin. Otherwise, how did Valmiki become a Brahmin, and how was Vyasji, whose Gita you read every day, a Brahmin?

Simple reasoning, whether someone considers it good or bad, the truth is that until you have realized your own Self, you are not worthy of being called a Brahmin. Now to know Brahma, Dwij is what a bird is called, and a Brahmin is also known as the same, the reason being, “Dwihi Jayte”, one who is born twice.

That bird is first in the form of an egg and then it becomes a bird. In the same way, a person is first in human form, and then becomes a self-realized yogi form. This second form of his — until it comes through transformation, until then... It’s not about simply putting a label on oneself saying, “I am a great yogi,” like a public advertisement.

There is no question of putting up a poster — it is the one who is transformed from within that becomes visible as that person.Today I was surprised that Dr. Nigam spoke, I had never heard his voice much. The day before yesterday, he said that my Vishuddhi has opened up completely, so today I was surprised to hear his voice, that Mr. Nigam is speaking so loudly, because I had not heard the voice. As soon as the Vishuddhi cleared, see what wonders happened. Those who never sang before, started singing well, those who never painted, have become great artists. From nowhere, people reach great heights. And everyone is blissful, sitting satisfied.

But some previous good deeds must be present. Now if you say that Mother, give awakening to Hitler, then it is a very difficult task. And why should I give it to Hitler? I have many devotees, will I give it to them or not?

Now that I have worked so hard in England, I have become weary. I tell these people to let me go, there are thousands of people in my country, let them get realisation, they are useless people. And I also want to tell the people of Delhi that if the people there do not get better soon, then I do not want to deal with more people over there. Maharashtra is a different matter, Rajasthan is also like this. It is possible that if Sahaja Yoga becomes popular in regions like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, etc. then the brains of Delhi people will also improve.

Yes, yes, okay, if you have any other questions, ask first.

This question is very important. I am going to make you practice now.

I needed some water.

Seeker - Why should you practice daily?

Yes, daily practice. I will tell you that too.

See, the thing is, it is so surprising, now there is no harm in telling you people, that this camera of yours, it has more vision than you. And my pictures have come out in such a way that you will be surprised. At some places, even many hands have come, And once I raised my hand like this, and light came out from there, many streams of it were formed, Om was also written on it. Once in the sky, in a similar way, in Switzerland, they saw that a big cloud of light came, and many streaks came out of it, and two clouds were formed. They gave photographs of the clouds, so in one there is Ganesh Ji, and in another my complete photo, even the nose and the hand. And in the other there is a photo of mine, as the same photo comes out of it, so these are the miracles of the camera. So this is that the universe is expressing through many things, that now the time has come, and you should get this work done.

Similarly, there is vibration in my photo as well. This is a miracle of the camera that there is vibration in the photo. So, now you can see in this photo as well, there is vibration in this photo as well. Just as we say that there is a statue, which is a “Swayambhu” (natural statue, created underground) there is vibration in it, similarly, there is vibration in this photo. So first you find using the photo to be self restraining, to use it. Now this also includes people thinking, “Why don't we put our own photo?” So put it, but it doesn't work.

So there is vibration in my photo, (hence) you use it. The way to use it is very simple, light a lamp in front of it and sit in this way with both hands towards it. And if you feel some coolness in your hand, then know on which hand it is happening, is it more on this hand, more on this (the other) hand? Understand if it is happening more in this hand and less in this one, it means that your left side has become weak, obviously.

So at that time, turn your left hand towards my photo, sit on the ground, and keep your right hand on the ground.

So the energy will start flowing in the left and after passing through here, it will go inside the ground.

Suppose if the right hand is weak, then you turn your right hand towards me, keep a lamp in front of you, not the lamp, whenever you keep your left hand keep the lamp, and whenever you keep your right hand, do not keep the lamp, then you keep your right hand towards me, your left hand upwards. And keep water, the water element below, put some salt in it. This will clean your right side.

All this is written in the book, I think. Is it written? Well, then keep both hands towards the photo and see if the same thing is happening on both hands. If it starts happening like that, then light a lamp in front of the photo every night before going to sleep, with both hands towards the photo. Keep looking at the photo, and put both feet in water, with salt added, hot, lukewarm, or cold as you like. After sitting in it for five minutes, when the flow of vibrations start cascading on the hands, and vibrations start coming out from the head as well, then wipe the feet, keeping the attention there (head), go to sleep.

Then in the morning, before going out, meditate for a while in front of the photo, and put yourself in the protection of your Mother. We call it a bandhan. How to give the bandhan, by rotating in this way, respected doctor, did you tell? Put on the protection, and awaken the kundalini once again and then go out.

For example, you have to meet a person, and that person is no good, pretend to write his name on your hand, just pretend as if writing someone’s name on your hand. After falsely writing it, rotate it like this, and repeat three times, “Mother, Mataji”, whatever you wish to say. Like this, three times, take it (hand) away like you throw something out.

Now you are using this power of love, this power of love is flowing through your hands. From the heart, that person will develop sympathy and love for you. Till now we have used the power of hatred, of enmity, of competition, this is the power of love. By doing this you will automatically feel lighter, in the fingers.

While simply sitting like this, if you can think about  any person you wish to, what is he suffering from, put your hand like this towards that person, keep the photo in front of you. What problem does this person have? Your fingers will start becoming numb. Now understand that this finger of yours has become numb, what does it mean? What disease does he have? The disease will be diagnosed in this hand, and the ego. And his mental strength will be diagnosed in this hand.

If you people learn a little bit about this, you will become great Sahaja Yogis. But many things should be understood in Sahaja Yoga. One of them is that we have now entered world religion. Earlier there were religions, and now this is a world religion. And in the world religion, we should respect all religions completely.

We should respect everyone, in Sahaja Yoga we do not insult any religion. And all those differences that we perceive among people — we come to truly understand them within ourselves, by directly seeing that all those great beings and incarnations are actually established within us. We are fighting with ourselves when we hold on to a misunderstanding. We go beyond this misunderstanding. We have many misunderstandings, like I was telling you yesterday, it is a simple thing, that we fast on the day when any God is born. This is a very wrong thing.

One of my disciples was a great devotee of Ganapati, Mr. Agnihotri. Many Agnihotras (sacred fire rituals or hawans) were performed in his house, he is a great devotee of Ganapati, he was also a Sahaja Yogi. He came and told Me that he was suffering from prostate problems. I said how is this possible, you are a devotee of Ganapati and Ganapati looks at prostate glands. How did you get prostate problem?

So he said, "Mother, it happened, the doctor said that I have to undergo an operation." So I said, "Look here, our Prasad is chickpeas (chana), so I said, "Here, brother, eat Chana Prasad." So he started looking here and there. I said, what is the matter? So he said, "Mother, today is Sankashti, so I fast today."

I said, “Sankashti means you are celebrating the birth of Shri Ganesh. When a child is born in your house, do you fast that day? That would be like observing mourning rituals. When someone dies, people fast — so how would Lord Ganesha be pleased with you if you fast on His birthday?. I picked up a gram and gave it to him, he ate it.When he went back to Pune, the doctor said, “How did your prostate get cured, brother?”

Now this is something to be seen. So we keep annoying our Gods day and night. If we acquire knowledge about them, then we can understand how to please them.

This knowledge is subtle as well as comprehensive. It contains the essence of all knowledge, this principle is fixed. It makes you grasp the essence of the principles. It removes all the external, gross or material things and makes the principle stand out and brings you to the principle.

If you understand that principle, then the work is done. But for that, an open mind is needed. A person with an open mind is needed, a person with a dull mind will say, 'No sir, I only believe in Shankar ji! And I do not believe in Krishna ji.'

So I will say to him, “Well, brother, we will meet in the next life! Nothing will happen in this life!” So you should understand that it is your good fortune. When a mother feeds her child, is it the child's stomach that gets filled, or the mother's? But even then the mother feeds him in such a way that the child thinks that he is doing a favour to the mother. In a way, it is a favour to the mother that the mother's love is fulfilled. But it also depends a lot on the understanding of the child.

So now we shall meditate a little. Do you have any more questions? What are you saying? Yes, will tell you the method now. Has it been told? Why not?

(to Shaja Yogi) Well, I thought you were explaining.

Give me water, yes I am telling you. Just take it..

Okay, now the way to (take) the protection ‘Kavach’? It is simple, because now (awareness of) this awakening has happened from the hand and this cool cool is flowing from your hand, so you have become capable yourself. You can give yourself your own shield, because now the power has started flowing. Now, as I told you yesterday, the left hand of yours, meaning that you should put your left hand towards the photo because it is your  power of desire. Understand this, power to desire. And the right hand of yours, right, take it up above your head, completely above your head, completely, lift it from here. So as you sit, understand that you have to take it from the knee, taking full care, bring it like this and leave it here.

Seven times if you do it this way. Then do it again.

Three. Four. And this five. Six. And this seven.

Now see, seven halves, half the number makes  three and a half times. There is a lot of mathematics behind this, there is a lot of mathematics behind three and a half coils of Kundalini, now that will be explained sometime.

Now, coming to the matter of this awakening of the Kundalini, while raising it, it can be raised like this also, but it is better that this desire of having the Kundalini awakening, this desire of raising it, while showing it with this hand, it should be held over the Kundalini in this manner, first, the left hand, below. Now this hand has to be rotated. Now what is called, “clockwise” like the hands of a clock. This hand will move straight and that hand has to be rotated. For that you see, in this way, very carefully, look at the left hand. And leaving the shoulders loose, keep looking upwards like this, towards the hand, and take the hand up to the top. And then take it up and twist it a couple of times and tie it. This is the first time, the first knot. This is the Maha Kali knot. Now the second one. Now see, the hand will rise quickly. Now let go of the shoulder and twist it again, this second knot. This is the Maha Saraswati knot. No, it is happening in reverse, yes this, and you don't have to rotate this hand at all. When you, you have to rotate this one only, you have to keep this straight. That one is to be rotated like this, keep on moving it like this. Like this. Okay, now the second one. The third knot is Mahalakshmi's knot. First Ida, Pingala and Sushumna. This one is the Sushumna knot.

Now, take it in this way, turn the head upwards, tie it once, then tie it a second time and then pull it towards this side for the third time, which is called Neer knot. Now see the hand, the matter has started in full swing. You have done your work. It is very simple, before going into anything, one should take the bandhan.

If you cannot give a bandhan to someone with your hands, then give a bandhan with your attention. Give bandhan with the attention. Bandhan is very important, because with that, no demonic knowledge or any wrong thing can enter inside you. You will be more impactful and will transcend that person, that incident or that situation. There is absolutely no need to get anxious. You will be surprised how things will get done naturally. God's messengers are so beautiful, they will make every task of yours happen.

But do not think that we have not achieved anything yet, and try this and see how much benefit you get from it. This is one of your methods externally. Now people here do a lot of things later on. But in the beginning, as I told you, the method of meditation, both times, one is to meditate for ten minutes at night and five minutes in the morning, do not do anything more.And whenever you look at anything, try to become thoughtless. This state of thoughtlessness should be increased, this is very important.

Until you increase the state of thoughtlessness, you cannot progress. When the mind remains restless, the mind is restless, just like if the earth becomes restless, then no creation can take place on it. Similarly, in the mind that becomes restless, creation cannot take place, nor can growth take place. That is why it is necessary to meditate at home. But apart from this, there is one more thing which is very important, that Sahaja Yoga is the work of a collective consciousness.

“I do it in my house, Mother!”

Therefore, no, wherever there is a centre, one must go there once a week as if it is very important. My attention is in that place where ten Sahaja Yogis sit and meditate. That is why you should definitely come (to the centre). Now you will see that initially when you are there, politics will start, because we have a path of downward progress and a path of upward progress. From the path of upward progress, we will come a little bit towards downward progress and then we will jump here and there. Monkey hopping keeps happening. You will see this in the beginning. Then you will see that there is a person who will do too much and someone else will pull his neck. These are the customs of our country, they will pull your hands and legs a little. It is okay.

Sahaja Yoga cannot be achieved by running away from the world, it has to be achieved by staying here. Therefore, whatever upheaval takes place, keep watching it as a witness. And things will be built up gradually. And you will be surprised that those who progress, those who rise high, will manage and take care of it. So first of all our fingers should be completely sensitive. This is the first thing. If the fingers are not sensitive yet, then it should be treated.

One thing is that at our place, kumkum has a lot of importance in this. We used to apply Kumkum Tilak earlier. So before going to sleep at night, we will give you Kumkum, apply it and then sleep, wash your face in the morning. You should apply it at night and then sleep.

In the same way, for physical pain also, there are certain things, which we say, have been given Mantras. That is, we will awaken them and give vibrations to things such as water, and keep them here before leaving.

Similarly, there is sugar, salt and some oil. We will use mantras and keep it here. You can take it from these people. You can bring these from home and add a little of it from here and take it with you. Add more to that, keep increasing it and keep taking it. Now there are some people who have liver problems, for them as well, we will tell some small things by which their livers will be cured.

If someone has any other complaint, these people can, are able to understand everything and will explain to you. However, these people are not your Gurus, but they are like senior people. So you should not feel bad about learning from them. Maybe they are younger than you or older, it does not matter. So we have to learn now, we should think that it has just begun. You have just entered the domain of God, you should understand that you will have to learn its rules and regulations. That is all you have to learn, what else?

Are there any among you whose hands have not felt cool yet? If they haven't felt, please tell us, these people will fix it.

Are there, the ones who have not felt yet, raise your hands. Not felt as yet? Okay, now keep your hands like this, whatever God you believe in, suppose you believe in Shri Krishna or Shakti, whomever you believe in, ask if Mother, are you that person yourself? There is only one Shakti. Just ask this much, ask with open eyes. Openly, I am not afraid, you ask. Yes, ask thrice.

Son, ask the one whom you believe in, mother, are you the same person in reality?

Ask, ask in your heart. Ask in your heart. Your hands will get instant relief, ask with open eyes.

Felt?

Seeker : Yes

Heat is coming, heat will go away, heat is generated by the liver. Liver. Turn your hands like this. The one who is feeling heat, turn your right hand towards Me, left hand up like this. Are you feeling heat? In which hand? Are you feeling heat? If you are not feeling it, then why are you raising it, you take the (God’s) name.

Now those who smoke cigarettes, eat tobacco, we don't tell them, we don't forbid them, they will give it up on their own. But the Vishuddhi Chakra gets caught up. That is why it will not be felt on the hand. But it will definitely be felt on the head.

(telling yogis - Okay, just see, please see, find out.)

Now these people have been brought from abroad, Yogis. Now you have to go abroad.

Just see. You raise your hands, those who are not able to get it. See if it is coming now. Not coming yet? Whom do you believe?

(Yogi - Those who are not able to get it, raise your hands so that we can see from behind.)

(Believe) in Shri Krishna? Ok. Ask, Mother, you are?

Sit here, ask, “Mother, are you Shri Krishna in person?”

These have come from somewhere? You were tourists here? Good! Have you given them realisation? Great!

See, they have got realisation. Yes, look at these people.

“Yes, do you believe in Shri Krishna? You must have had some sort of some Guru? The Guru principle (void) is spoiled. The Guru is wrong. You keep this hand here. On the stomach, no, no. Keep the right hand here on the stomach. Inside, inside. Open it a little. Keep it on the stomach, now turn this hand towards me and say, ‘Mother, I am my own Guru.’ Say it.

Yes, give me some more water, Respected Doctor. It is very hot. Hmm, thank you!

Turn this hand towards me, son.

(Doctor - This hand towards Mother.)

Towards Mother.

(Doctor - One hand towards Mother. Are you feeling it? Check with your other hand, keep your hand on this side, concentrate on this side [Sahasrara]. Raise your hands a little. ..... Take both hands in front.)

Are you seeing that? Give them realisation. Just see this gentleman. Talk to him. They are from what country?

(Yogi - They first come to Kathmandu, Mother, going to the center there.)

I see. That's what I was wondering!

(Yogi - They are both from Germany.)

Good. You have to do a lot in Germany, I must say.

(Shri Mataji addresses a seeker) How are you? You say, 'Mother, give me pure education.' That's it.

(to another seeker) Do you also have the same complaint?

Doctor - He is feeling it.

Ok, do you know Hindi? Have you got your realisation?

(to Yogis) Teach them, teach these people.Just teach him. You should get Rajasthanis to do the job.

Left Swadhisthan has very strong (blockage). Good Lord! Who is your Guru?

Vedanti ?

Done? What do you take? Tobacco? Doesn’t matter, all that will go away.

(Doctor - It will be alright.)

Tell him to do "Allah ho Akbar." Become a Muslim, come on, put your finger in your ear. Say, tell him, this is also a mantra of Virat, Akbar means Virat. Mohammed saheb had talked a lot about Virat. Even Muslims don't understand, now even Hindus don't understand it. Say it sixteen times. Sir, now you learn this.

This person has got it (Kundalini awakened) very strongly, this, the one who is sitting in the middle. Yogi: Keep your hands in front.

A change has come in the eyes, there is a change in the eyes. Suddenly, there is a sparkle in the eyes.

You also, a sparkle comes in the eyes. He has got it (realization), he is sitting over there. The face changes, a smile appears.

Now, the one who is sitting and looking behind, why are you getting worried, son? Yes, don't worry at all, they are sitting behind you and working hard for you only. It will happen, it will happen. Don't worry.

Come, come here, these are really very small children.

Come, come, come, sit, sit. What is your name? Yes? Shyam Lal, sit. Shyam Lal, sit. What is the matter? Sit. Put your hands.

(New seeker - I am feeling hot.)

Yes, that is the matter. Both hands. That is the matter, that is what is happening to you, let the heat go out, then it will cool down. Whom do you believe in? In Shri Shyam?

(New seeker - In Shri Ram)

In Shri Ram? Okay, proceed, ask the question now. This right hand, left hand in this way, now ask, “Mother, are you the incarnation of Shri Sita Ram?’ Now ask.

Eyes, open eyes, don't close them. Don't raise your attention upwards, ask the question directly by looking at my face. Yes, Shri Rama.

(to Yogi) You don't do it, you are right, right heart.

(Yogi - he was the one who was asking a question about, “May I say the Lord's name and not Mother’s name?”)

Another one there who expelled Sita Ji, were you not among them?

(New seeker - What was said, I did not understand.)

He is saying that, he said that why should the name of the father not be taken, why should the name of the mother be taken? So the same people expelled Sitaji, right? The people of U.P. are still suffering for that sin. And will continue suffering.

Mahalakshmi, who was in the form of Sita, was thrown out of the house. What is the beauty of a house without a mother?

That’s why I told them — right, right heart (Anahata) catches in them too.

Now you don't try on a right heart, that’s all.

Yes, now see, is it flowing (cool vibrations),it’s coming, no? Now, just ask Sita Ji for forgiveness — that when you were insulted, we just stood there watching. We didn’t say anything...  Ayodhya. Yes, (vibrations are) coming? Problem is in the hand, now bring it here, keep it here.

Oh, Hanuman ji fought with Shri Ram Chandra on behalf of Sita. This... many times. And Sita ji forsake Ram Chandra ji at the right time, as his wife. Who says she did not leave him, did she not merge into the earth or did she go with him? Then? Later, he kept wandering and crying for her, “Sita! Sita!” And took samadhi (immolation) in the Saryu (river). What was Ram without Sita? Sita's name is taken first, then Ram Chandra's. Yes, if Sita was nothing then why did he go after her, if not to find her?

Yes, the difference between a man and a woman is understood by man, not God. Moon (Chandra and Chandrama), moonbeam, their meanings cannot be different. Just like the words and meanings are together, in the same way, God and his power go together, the difference is made by man with his intelligence.

And now they’ve even created a conflict between Shiva and Krishna. It was Sage Bhrigu who stirred up that quarrel. So Shiva became Ardhanarishwara (half-male, half-female form). But we don't truly understand it, do we? Yes, look, pick it up.

And after Sita ji left, why did Shri Ram Chandra sleep on grass? Learn from those whom you believe in, brother. Do you understand?

(Yogi - The heat is in the left hand now.)

It is in the left hand right now. That will go away, it will go away.

Put this right hand on the earth. This is Sita's mother.

(telling yogis) He has been to some Gurus.

Ask him to put his right hand on his left navel, and then say that.

Yes, son? Are you in pain? It will go away. Come. Now tell me. The coolness has begun to flow. This is your mother, who is pulling out all your (problems). So call Shri Ram. Yes, one wonders, why those who worship Shri Ram, cannot understand his love for Sita ji? That’s the thing.

Did you get it (cool breeze)? You are feeling a little cool. It is done, isn't it?

Just see on his head. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Close your eyes straight, don't lift them up like this. Straight, no, no not like this, straight, just like we close our eyes, close them like this.

No no no, look at my feet and then close it (eyes). Keep looking down, down. Again you are raising your eyes, what is the point of lifting them up. Down, like this, quietly, just like we close them, quietly, you can close them like that. What is the need to raise them up like this? Yes, peacefully like this.

Yes, how are you?

Tell him, Warren, you fix his Vishuddhi. That’s all he needs. Now you will be able to give up tobacco, what should I do? We all went to Ganpatipule, all the shopkeepers had a great time there. Except for the poor paan, bidi, matchbox vendor, his condition became extremely bad. He said, not a single thing of mine was sold, no one even bought a matchbox.

Just see, fix his Vishuddhi. Yes,this is a right heart fellow.

Definitely right heart! He too?

Whom do you worship?Hanuman ji?

Then yes? Yes, what do you chant? Yes, but who is it, brother?

(Yogi- He must have given a mantra, which one?)

Right heart ! That’s why I am feeling a catch.

Yes, say the mantra in front of me. Put this hand on the ground. Yes, say it, say the mantra. Now put this hand like this. Like this, yes, now say it. This one has got self realization.

Hmm, no? Okay, put this hand here, here. Now put your right hand on the ground, now say. Left, right, both the Vishuddhi. Once again, he has got it, Warren, just see now, this one, this one, right heart.

Now you are good? Doesn’t catch, right heart.

But you see, how weakness goes to weakness. That's the point.

Has it not happened? Okay, let's see now.

Did it happen to you or not yet? Did (vibrations) come over (your head) or not? Have you been able to get realization?

Keep it, keep your hands again. Why do you keep your hands tied when you are sitting in front of your mother?

Did it happen for you, son?

(Seeker -  Getting heat.)

On both hands? Okay, keep the right hand this way, left hand like that.

(yogi - still not feeling)

Sit a little far away, not close together. Keep your attention here, son. Keep your attention here.

Now keep your attention here. No, no, don't raise your eyes, keep your eyes on the feet. Keep your eyes on the feet, keep your attention here. Keep your attention here. Yes, now say, “Shri Mataji please come in my head.” Say, “Please come to my head”.

Liver, very bad liver. Liver. Put the left to the right. Yes, did you feel like something has come over the head?

(New seeker - Coolness.)

Has it come? Check with your hand. Lift it up a little, son. Up. Has it started flowing (on top)?

Okay, so far, it will happen soon. Keep saying, “Mother!”, say it from your heart, say it to yourself, “Ma, come to my head”.

Again, say it seven times.

Yes, you son? Take off your glasses, take off your glasses. Take off your glasses.

(Yogi - Take off your glasses)

Come forward, forward, come forward a little. I will rotate (with hands) your agnya.

(Yogi - Come forward)

Shift to the front, a little bit. Loosen up, loosen up, loosen up and sit down. Sit in front of Mother.

Okay, keep both hands like this, now both hands in this way. Close your eyes.

(Mother tells a Yogi -) this person has an extreme agnya catch.

Warren, if you can get a candle for this gentleman, has a bad agnya at the back.

How is this gentleman? Nothing happening? Not getting it (vibrations)? Come here, here. What is happening with you?

You keep sitting, keep sitting, they are attending to you.

I am asking about this person. What is your experience? I am asking you.

Not getting (vibrations) on the hands? You are one difficult person! Since yesterday, we have been putting our efforts on you! Now why don’t you put in your own efforts for the next 2-4 days.

(Shri Mataji speaks to a yogini) Yes, okay, she’s their daughter? It’s the daughter in  law? Good. Vishuddhi has a very strong blockage, same for the liver as well.

Respected Doctor, raise from left to the right, you will see, it will be work in a moment.

No, let it be. Keep both your hands towards me, both hands.

He has got it. He is still a child, not got entangled here and there. (If) they get entrapped by gurus, after that it becomes very difficult.

Yes, all okay?

(Seeker- Just by keeping your hand, I felt cool)

You want that I should continue to keep my hand on you. Okay. No, no, look.

It is not flowing here, and it is cool from here.

Just tie his Kundalini. Who is here? Please tie his. You come and sit like this.

Sit next to me, I will tie yours, learn how to tie it.

(Seeker - Should I go out?)

No, you keep sitting here, see the Kundalini falls down. I will raise it again and tie it.

You get up, (and, to another seeker) you sit down.

They will also explain how to tie it yourself.

Nothing happened? It will happen right now.

(Seeker - “Am I so fallen that nothing happens to me, what is the matter?” )

You have little faith in me. Isn’t it?

It is not like that, I have also come to you out of curiosity and longing .

That is fine, you have come here out of curiosity son. But have some faith in the person from whom you have to get such a big thing.

(seeker - I will believe you.)

Okay. ...

(Seeker - I am not disbelieving your words.)

Okay, go ahead. Come on, it will happen. Do not get frightened, and do not consider yourself to be a bad person, that’s all. That is the  most important thing, do not think that you are bad.

(Seeker - What works for others, why doesn't it work for me?)

Because my place is at the Sahastrara and if it stops at Sahastrara, then it means that your faith in me has to settle down a little. Sit down, they will tie your Kundalini. It will not stay up forcibly.

Yes, how are you now?

(Seeker - I can feel it till here, not on my hands.) Whom do you believe in?

(Seeker - Ganesha....)

So it is very easy. Ask the question, “Mother, are you Shri Ganesha? Are you Shri Ganesh Gauri? (To another seeker) Son, is it not happening to you?

(To a Yogi) Look at the left Swadhisthana, very strong (catch).

Do you have any Guru or someone like that? Is there a Guru? So it is due to him, the Guru has done the wrong thing. Okay, sit here, here on the ground.

Do this for them, light a lamp for them.

Both of you, both of you sit. You too come here, the ones who have a Guru, will sit here on the ground. Meditate for a while. It is okay.

You will have to say, “Mother, come to my head. Mother, come to my hands.” I will do it.

What happened to these people? Is it not working? What happened on the hands? Tell me? I will not tell you the reason. I will make you feel it. Why should I tell you the reason? Okay, the ring on the hand. ....

(Seeker - Not feeling the vibrations.)

Okay, now take off the ring for a minute.

Son, you also take off this ring and see. Take out both of them, both. Take off those too, just a minute. The rings restrict the fingers. Come on now, keep it here like this.

You are feeling it, son? Are you feeling it?

Agnya is blocked.

Bring the sindoor.

How are you now? Can you feel it on the head? Not feeling on the head, not on the hands? Take off the ring, the ring.

His left heart is caught, so take off the watch, too. Son, your fingers are shining. It should come on on the agnya, too.

(Seeker - I will practice daily at home, changes should come.)

Yes, they will come. Else why? It should come, that happens always.

The heart is catching, just a minute, you have come today only, right? So Brother, take it calmly. Patience is needed. Patience, it gets done with patience.

Is it alright with you?

He has started laughing, see, now that he has experienced it, he has started laughing.

We will work on you, too. Have patience, patience. Come and sit.

Yes, how are you? You experienced (self realization) yesterday. Didn't you? No? Well, alright.

So okay....it is diabetes. That is your left side, you have to do this while sitting, turn your right hand towards me, turn your left hand like this. Left hand like this. What job do you do?

(Seeker - I have retired, I was in service.)

Government?

(Seeker - No, private. I had retired from the government also.)

You retired from the government? Ask one thing, “Mother, are you the government of all governments?”

(To another seeker) Your Agnya is catching.

(Yogi - Left Swadhisthana)

You also sit, sit like this, like this. Towards the sky.

Oh my God, it is so heavy, very strong. It is a matter related to all the gurus! Ok, right to the left.

Right to the left. When it is (catches) due to Gurus, right to the left. Warren is laughing.

You people  also had a Guru. Why? All of you had a Guru.

Swadhisthana (blockage), are you listening? The problem by Gurus is going on.

Come here in front. Leave this, keep your attention here, close your eyes. Come in front, in front. Move further, further, come forward. Yes, now keep your attention here, close your eyes, keep your attention here

Sit down, sit down.

Make him sit here, and sit with hands towards Me. One hand, left hand towards Me, right hand on the ground.

(to a Yogi) And give him a light. You take the bandhan first. Take the bandhan, after that.

Hmm, keep your attention here, attention here, now say, “Mother, come to my head.”

Can you feel it? Feel it? Is it happening? Let it flow.

it's working,it will work, let it happen.

Say Mother, come to my head. Good Lord! All of these people have that too, (blocked) Sahastrara!

Yes, it has started clearing. Keep your attention here. Do you feel it?

Yes, your catch is here, this is Hansa Chakra, you have to put some ghee in it.

Then the noses will be okay..... Ask for a little clarified butter (ghee) of any type.

How is your condition? No? Do you feel (vibrations) on the head? It’s Vishuddhi, show the hands, it’s Vishuddhi.

How are you now, is something okay? Now, son, it cannot happen all of a sudden, no? Relax, relax, need patience. It’s My patience that gets exhausted after I keep seeing you people!

Yes?

Respected Doctor, you should take the addresses of those who have got realization and of those who could reach somewhere, so that there is correspondence in future also, (if) people will want to come here. By taking everyone's addresses, this will be a sort of association. There should be a relationship, if there is any problem tomorrow, everyone's addresses should be there. We can  keep them with the (yogini) sister.

Sit, sit, sit !

Yes, things are okay now, settled down. Can you feel the coolness on the hands? You don't even open your hands! Open your hands! Forgive everyone first, come here.

Have you forgiven everyone? Say it honestly, say it from your heart, say it again. Say it from your heart, close your eyes, "Mother, I have forgiven everyone."

Say it again, say it from your heart, you are just saying it like that! Say it from your heart.

(To a yogi) Where have you gone...are they done? Yes, tie them, tie them, tie them properly. And, teach them to tie it, their Kundalini falls.

Is anything okay now? Apply some more ghee on the nose. What have you brought, ghee? Getting it?

With that you can get the Hansa blockage (removed), that is why the eyes are not closing, they are not able to see or move. Get it applied in the nose.

Can you feel it (vibrations)? Do you feel it (vibrations) right now? Won’t happen? What else, did you become okay?

Yes, did not feel it (realization)?

Yes, come on now.

Warren, he is a nice fellow, just see, give him realization.

It’s okay, brother, all right?

This lady has got it (realization), for herself.

Is it lukewarm? Is it too hot? Not so hot, just fine. Give this one job to someone, get some cotton to put in the nose. Here is the cotton. Take this cotton.

Why? Huh? Vishuddhi? So you have got a little nosebleed (in Marathi).

You also son, go and get it done, you also, both of you, three. Get some ghee put into everyone’s nose. Go

Is your Vishuddhi okay...? It’s not working? What are they (yogis) telling you?  Son, go, get ghee put in your nose and then come back. Where has your ring gone?

(Seeker - I kept it.)

(Yogi - Don't have to do healing.)

That's the problem. That's (what) the trouble is. Their Ekadasha is blocked.

What do you think? So what do you do? Besides fighting with each other, what do you do? Who is the guru?

(Yogini to new seeker - Tell you name.)

(Seeker - Yogananda Paramananda)

Oh, (Lord) Rama, (Lord) Ram, trouble! Son, from where on earth did you get hold of him? Didn't see, didn't know, just made him a guru!

(Shri Mataji speaks few words in Marathi - unclear)

(to yogis) You go and tell them. Treat them. Having them get rid of their possessions is going to be a very difficult task.

Okay, you? Okay, son? You keep this hand towards me. Right hand, and left hand, do it like this. Say, “Mother, are you the basis of all the scriptures?” Say! Say, ‘Mother, are you the basis of all the scriptures?’ Say this ten times. “Are you the basis of all the knowledge?” Say this ten times only.

Okay, sit with both hands like this, it will be done in a jiffy. Yes, why, did you say ten times? Did you feel any relief? You felt it, right? The answer is also there! Now look, keeping your hand on your head. Now say, ‘Maa, come to my head!’ What did you study, son? What did you study? By education, not education, about the rest of the religion?

That’s good! And you did not consider anyone as your Guru or Master? Did you not consider anyone as your Guru? What is your education?

(Seeker - I have done B.A. I did not consider anyone as my Guru, but according to the religion....)

Which religion?

(Seeker - Jain)

Jain? Jainism, okay. Do this, keep your right hand on the ground and ask, “Shri Mahavir ji, are you Shri Mataji”?

Ask, ‘Shri Mahavir ji, are you the same?’

Ask the question in this way, “Mother, are you Shri Mahavir ji?” Have (the vibrations) come?

(To a yogi) He is supra conscious, very supra conscious. Extremely! Warren, I really, I sympathize with you. But what about me?

Yes, what? Did you ask? Ask, ‘Mother, are you Shri Mahavir Ji himself?’ Yes, is your hand alright now? Is it working?’ Is the head also getting cool? Not on the head?

Okay, say with both hands like this, ‘Mother, come to my head. Mother, come to my head’, say it.

You only know how to manage that. Did it happen to you? Great brother, it’s great! .... has gone to the right places.

(New seeker - Too much means, paying attention to the worship of God.)

So just say this, “Mother come into my head.”  First take practical (experience).  After studying a lot, the learned one becomes a fool.

(Yogi...unclear)

Oh! Oh! Oh, ho! Vivekanand ji just kept on saying. That is the mistake one makes, there is too much theory, then practical is not possible, hands don’t work.

Just gone to the right place.

No, no, you get up and come here. Exactly, I think!

(Yogi to seeker - Now, getting better, just left to right, open your eyes. Open your eyes and allow the excessive right side energy to pass now.

Yes, son! Now look, don't think of others, think of yourself. Say, 'Mother, come into my head.' Your head is filled with all the scriptures, you are not there I know, I am telling you my point. Say, 'Mother, come into my head.'

Are you feeling some coolness in your hands? No?

Hello, Danya! Please give her realization.

Okay, now put that hand (infront), this hand up. Forgive everyone, forgive. How are you? Nothing has happened? It will happen! We know...

(Yogi - Just think, I am not doing anything, Mother, you do everything.)

Done? What is happening?

(Yogi - The catch of left Swadhisthana is coming)

Left Swadhisthana? Okay, come, take this, take this. What is happening? Do you have any work?

Help him get self realisation.

You sit on the ground, come on the ground, on the ground.

Yes, get up. Vivekananda! It is not an easy task (to remove catches of Void.)

(Yogi - His vibrations are coming very strongly.)

His are coming, that's fine, now you are alright, aren't you?

Now just take a look at this person, this is Mahavirji's (follower) and this other one, he is not able to feel the Kundalini rise.

You raise this hand, this, raise this hand, come here, come closer.

And now say that I have forgiven everyone, say it, say it with all your heart. No, say it in your mind but say it with all your heart. You have to say it with all your heart. Say it with all your heart.

Yes, did you get your realisation? Kundalini awakened, or not?

Yes, now tell me, are you feeling it? Look, look, a faint sensation is coming. It (cool breeze) has come.

Have you got it, son? Have you got it or not? What happened?

Just look at them. Yes?

(Yogi - Mother, does he get blessed when he transmits healing to someone?)

Horrible!

(Yogi - No, you don't get blessed?)

If not, you should have got (experienced the cool breeze) by now, if you are blessed. Same background! That's what I was saying, you got a proper person to treat.

Yes, now.

(to yogi ) Same style. It's all playing with ghost science. All sorts of therapies he did. It's all playing with ghost science.

But what is it with them (Western seekers) that their intelligence, which is pure intelligence, son. They have very pure intelligence, that is why it does not allow ego to settle. They have pure intelligence, once they understand something, they get stuck to it, this is not in us. We keep moving here and there, (here we see) more of monkey like jumping. I am surprised at the way these people ascend.

You have to think about how fortunate I am to come here. That's how you have to think. That's how you should feel, you are fortunate to be here.

See the Vishuddhi, Vishudhi, Nabhi, Agnya.

Hmm, how is it [unclear]? Agnya? She was telling me.

Put her right hand towards me and left hand up there, it should be alright. Mrs. Patkar says, ‘Mother, my temper is still there.’ Sahaja yogis should not relax, must work. Come here, come. Work on this little boy, this gentleman.

Is it ((Flow of vibrations) happening? Coming, right? Here, from below? Come on, leave it.

Put him left to the right, can you? Just come. This one, this gentleman.

This one is also left to the right.

Yes, I have to go, I have to leave.

Not happening (flow of vibrations) ? Let’s go.

How is he? All right, put him left to the right as much as you can.

What about this gentleman: Raise it (Kundalini).

Huh? It’s not coming (the vibrations)? What are you wearing around your neck? Take it off, can you? Take it off. Just a minute, if you can.

Vishuddhi might be, that's why.

You don't have a ring on your hand? Well, take off your watch too. Don't keep it on the other side, keep it down. Down, in front. You don't have to look here and there, just look here only.

Is it okay now?

The matter (of Kundalini awakening) has started. Come, that's it, now we have to move forward, that's it. Come this evening, it will grow further. It grows day by day.

Are you alright son? I am asking about you, about you. I am looking at you, only you. Are you alright? Is it not happening? You take hold of David, how is he?

Quite a lot. Come this evening. Let's go. Then see this boy, he can be very good.

Then see this boy, he can be very good. Raise his Kundalini, his one. Next to that, at the back.

How are you? Nothing? How is this? What happened, son? How are you? Are you alright? Vibrations are coming (on the head)? Who is your Guru? Guru Nanak? Good!. Put your hands like this. Tell me, “Mother are you Guru Nanak himself?” Ask. Ask with eyes open, brother. Yes, ask, look at me here.

Did you feel cool? Yes, it is okay, it (vibration) has started (to flow), right? You say, “Mother, you are Shri Guru Nanak.” Then it will be very cool.

Yes, you must always ask them (their) Guru's name. Since Guru Nanak is a Sadguru (true master) then what is there in a Guru? So it is very easy to give her realization, should be.

Yes, it’s (vibrations) coming, look. It’s coming (the vibrations), right? Let them flow, let them flow.

Yours, yours has started flowing, it is visible on your face.

Your (Vibrations) son? Has he not achieved anything yet?

Give them (realisation), come along. Give it to him.

It is not working out? Nothing is working out? Amazing! Come here, where is Kumkum?

Is it [unclear]?

She took it? Okay, sit down, let's go. Who do you believe in?

(Seeker) Everyone, especially Shri Krishna.

Especially? Ask, “Mother, are you Shri Krishna Himself?” Ask. Huh? Ask.

Raise, raise his Kundalini, yes. Tie it. Yes now raise it, tie it up, tie it up. Did anything come? Look at the hand. You have to believe in Shiva also, it is not enough to believe only in Krishna. Shiva is there. Which mantra do you chant?

Tell me. Ok, which prayer? With open eyes, with open eyes. Did you feel it? Is the coolness coming? Is it coming or not?

It has begun. The fingers are shining. Look, is it coming?

Just see on his head.

On the head, not yet? Not yet? Which side?

(Yogi - It’s hot.)

Not much. Hot? Is there a Guru? Is there any Guru?

(Seeker - Yes, there are Gurus.)

(Unclear ...)

Who? Hey brother, why do you take ‘Brahma Sambandh’ (mantra by any Guru to establish connection with the Supreme Being?

(Seeker - I had not done anything, he lives in Ahmedabad.)

All ‘Ahmedabadis’ are like this, useless people. Brahma Sambandh.

“Mother, please do my Brahma Sambandh”.

Again.

(Seeker - Mother, please do my Brahma Sambandh.)

Again.

(Seeker - Mother, please do my Brahma Sambandh.)

Kundalini has started rising properly. With this (prayer) Kundalini is moving in the right direction, yes.

Now tell me! People come to have a relationship with God Almighty and take money. There should be some purity when trying to establish a divine connection. And all these wicked people together ruined the girls, and that too in Ranchod Das ji's temple, right?

Hmm, all right, now it (vibrations) are coming to your hands. It has come to your head, check now.

Bring it.

Ekadasha (catch or blockage on Sahastrara).

Warren, we have Ekadasha here. Just look after the Ekadasha.

He’s got it?

Vaishnavas (those who were taking the mantra for Brahma Sambandh) should get it first.

It (Kundalini) is sitting on the Nabhi (chakra), isn’t it?

Yes, look! Just have a look.

Tie it up, tie it up (Kundalini).

All right, it (Kundalini) has started (moving upwards), you look. Look! Feel it. Close your eyes.

Hamsa? He;s all right, he’s got it.

It’s done (self realization), the process (of Kundalini rising) has started.

Let him do “Allah ho Akbar” sixteen times, his hands will start working out. He (Alah) is Virat, Virat means Akbar. What else? Mohammed sahab did not praise anyone else, he praised only Shri Krishna. We do not understand that, Muslims are such fools.

They are great donkeys, they used to sit on donkeys and right now they are sitting on donkeys. Yes, we are also becoming donkeys along with them. Because when you compete with donkeys, you will also become a donkey. If you compete with horses, you will become a horse.

Just see this gentleman.

Place your hands like this, son. Sit like this, you are sitting with your hands tied like that.

Open your eyes, look here, why are you looking at this, why are you looking at others?

Yes, now it is okay, a small beginning has been made, according to us “Brahma Sambandh” has been done. But it is with your hands (where the seeker cannot feel yet), he will tell you.

Tell them to say 'Allah Ho Akbar'.

This person is done, awakening has happened.

(Yogi - Right heart. .....)

(Take) the names of Shri Ram and Hanuman ji.

What is your name, son? Tell me your name?

He is feeling shy.

Tell me what your name is? He has got self realisation, he was born a realised soul.

Hmm, what is your name? Oh, do tell, tell me your name? You are feeling shy, look here, you should tell me your name.

Let it go, he is feeling shy.

Also put some ghee in his nose, he has problems, same (as other one).

You get some ghee put in your nose. Go.

Is there ghee there? Get some cotton wool and call her now, you have to go at one o'clock, so we must go at twelve thirty.

(Warren - Yogi said. .... )

Yogi, he told me to come after one.

(Warren - He told, “You said, only if called?”

No. No, how? Who said that? No, he definitely said we must come after one o'clock, so there is no question of calling. We are waiting for you now, I have to go.

(Warren - You are coming, too?)

I am not coming there.

Yes, get some drops (of ghee) inside (the nose). It (realisation) will happen, it (kundalini awakening) has started, it has come to the head. She’s coming.

To yogini -  you can check (the vibrations).

Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi - Put (the drops) into his nose.

Go sit there, she will put it.

How is he? Ask him to say that mother come in my head. Yes, what happened to him now?

This one, what happened to him ?

And you, at least something good is happening.

Keep sitting, keep sitting. Not facing the sun, sit here, otherwise it is very,.....sit this way.

To a yogi - Get a photograph. Now he has not felt anything, no?

The Vishuddhi, ask him to say Allah ho Akbar sixteen times, with the head up.

(Unclear .... In Marathi)

Sit comfortably, in Sahaja pose (legs folded).

It is hot. Oh, my God! It is very hot. Say it like this, Mother, come to my head. Yes, please.”

No, I am going with Mrs. . .. No, no, you take him, some Rajsthali fellow.

Take him, come. What happened? Did your (kundalini) rise above your head?

What? Bhavsagar?

(Yogi's answer) He is meditating on Kundalini only.

What is he doing to make his Kundalini work?

(Yogi's - This is the work of cleansing the chakras).

How? Is it already there?

(Yogi's answer) Who told you it is already there? Who had said that?

(Yogi - I am not telling the name.)

(Seeker - Baba Bharti used to say.)

The whole Ekadasha is blocked.

Oh, ho, ho, ho! What a drama they are creating. Bring his (sympathetic side) down, keep his (side) down.

Yes, first bring down the left and right sympathetic. Bring down Ida, Pingla. When it is completely down, then the Kundalini will be cleansed. Not otherwise. Both Ida and Pingla will rise. It (blockage) is still on Ekadasha right now.

To the seeker - Ask them (yogis). Ask the mantra of Ekadasha.

(Seeker - Show me some small..miracle)

What? Son, what’s this that you are doing?

(Seeker - The thing is that until some past karmas are there, the guru shows how to get over those.)

Did he show you how? Because you will not be able to tolerate it. If you can tolerate it, they will show it to you. You will get another body.

(Shri Mataji tells Yogis) Let him be, he is a stubborn man, leave him. Let him go to the one he talked of, let that person fix him!

(Seeker - I will write to you privately, ...........you may please .....)

(to a new seeker) Are you from Kannauj? Oh, wonderful ! Do some work in Kannauj. Kannauj is your.....

Yes, what happened?

Son, why is it not working for you? Why is it not happening? Say,“Mother, come to my head.” Speak.

What about him?

Didn't happen? Let it be, it will work out today in the evening. Come on, it will happen today in the evening.

Take some water from there, Vibrated.

Have you got some sugar for them? You should give sugar to all those with the gurus? Ask for some sugar.

Eat some sugar today, it will clear the Guru principle. Your Guru is sitting like this, it is clearly visible from his face. Why are you holding on to him like a mad person? Leave him!

Huh? Better?

The path for the full movement of the Kundalini in your case, is like this...

(Seeker - ...do something.)

How to do it? Leave the Guru, then I will, not possible otherwise. First, you sit on the crocodile and say that take me in (your) boat. Then how can we take you? First leave the crocodile’s back.

Straightforward reasoning.

I have nothing to gain from you, you go to your Guru. Get it (Kundalini awakening) done through him only. You can come to me only if you have  a Sadguru ...Yes, there is a Sadguru. See right now, this lady, she believes in Guru Nanak. As soon as she took his name, she got it (vibrations) on her hands.

If your Guru was a Sadguru, I would have gone to meet him myself, do you understand? Not a Sadguru.

Whatever I say, that will be the truth, will your mother lie to you? Son, I am telling you the truth, the Guru principle gets spoiled, all the Chakras get spoiled.

I had to go....

(Yogini) It's been a long time.

It (vibrations) has come, right? See, this one has also got his realisation. You are the only one left.

Put (the drops) in the nose.

Okay, tell everyone who has problems with their Guru principle, give everyone a little sugar. Keep it mixed with the sugar in your sugar jar. Give it with a spoon, do not touch it with your hands.
