"The Creation", New Delhi (India), 20 February 1977

Tonight we had decided to talk about Creation but our management has not been able to provide me with a chalk and with a blackboard so, I don't know, I'll try to explain it without drawing. It's a very difficult subject. And I'll try to make it intelligible. But I would request you to pay full attention for such a difficult subject like Creation.

The greatest blessing today is that many of you can feel the vibrations. And not only that but you also know and realise that they can think and they can love. It's a very big blessing. Of course, some of you haven't got it, but those who have got it know that these vibrations organise, because they raise the Kundalini, they go to the place where it is needed, out of compassion, to that portion where there is deficiency. They understand, they organise they are universal in nature and they love. They answer to your questions, when you ask them some questions - you receive answer from them. They are living vibrations. These vibrations are from the Divine. This Divine is called as Brahma, Brahma Tattwa, Principle of Divine.

We can say that the process of Creation is an eternal process. Means a seed becomes a tree and the tree becomes a seed, and the seed becomes a tree, and it goes on and on - it's eternal. So, it cannot have a starting point and it cannot have an ending point. It goes on and on and on. That's why it can have different states of existence, you can say, state of being.

So, the first, just the being, is Brahma, where nothing exists. We say 'nothing'. When we say nothing, it is a relative word: because we do not exist, so we say 'nothing exists' - it's a relative word. When we are not existing, for us everything is 'nothing'. There is something, but that is not ourselves. And that's why, relatively, we say it is ‘nothing'. It's only the word Brahma, we can say. You can think of an energy, if you want to, an energy-form that exists. But the energy accumulates at a point and forms a nucleus. The energy that thinks, energy that is distributed, accumulates at a point, concentrates on a point, you can say, and this point is the point we call as Sadashiva.

This happens because that energy desires, thinks, organises, loves. When it wants to create, when the desire is felt in that energy to create, at that time a nucleus is created. This nucleus we call as Sadashiva. This nucleus does not disappear. You can think of a nebula. I mean, it is something which is all relative you can think, you cannot think something in absolute form. So, with thinking you cannot conceptualise the whole thing, but if you can think of a state, where it's just an energy and no creation. But not the energy of electricity, magnetism - all these things. Is the combination, the synthesis of all the things which goes into laya which becomes that, dissolves into that. It coagulates on a point,  that may be a [suitable] word,  coagulates at a point which we can call as a nucleus. This point we call as Sadashiva. This Sadashiva is the Ishwara, is the God Almighty.

We call it now “God” because now it has a limitation. In the sense that we can call it something. But if it is just an energy we just call it a Brahma. You can say like this: when the water becomes ice, a follicle of ice is formed, you can differentiate between the water and the ice, but still, it's a relative, relative understanding.

At this state God Almighty, Parameshwara, takes its form as an identity. That's why we can say that it is not Brahma, but an identity. Identity has its aura, has its aura, we can say, its light. This light is the Divine Love.

It goes into various forms but Sadashiva remains as He is.

Now, the desire to create is transferred to the aura. The aura is the Power of God, Shakti. Ishwara has certain things beyond Him also and before Him. God Almighty has something beyond Him that He cannot control: one, He cannot control His eternal nature. It is His nature to be eternal, He cannot stop it. He will go on changing His form, it is His nature, it just... it is His swabhava. He cannot change it, His eternal nature. He will be eternally. Eternity is His temperament, His nature, He cannot overcome that.

For example, God cannot take away your freedom to choose the Truth. He cannot. Once He has granted, He’s not going to take it away. You have to choose it in all your freedom. He will not force you to take it. Many people have hopes like that - they are sadly mistaken. At this juncture only lies the problem of complete destruction or complete resurrection. It is left into the hands of human beings to decide whether they want to accept the Truth or if they want to follow the falsehood. So, you have [been] given complete freedom to choose.

I won't go into the details about God Almighty, because it's a very subtler subject and requires much more attention. I have talked about it before to many people and all His nature, they know that. But He is the Witness, He is the Sakshi (witness) in the form of a Sakshi. What is He witnessing? He is witnessing the Creation. And the power that creates the Creation is the Shakti, is His power, is His consort. Now, for us, human beings, we don't understand that a wife and a husband could be that one (unified). For example, you can understand like a Sun and a sunlight, Moon and the Moonlight - as these two things are one and the same. Or the meaning and the word. In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are one together. For example, you can be a father, you can be a mother. You can be a father, you can be a brother, you can be a son - three things you are doing together. In the same way, you can be your Self and your power. You know: you and your Self and your power are different, but you are one. You have a power to write, but you are not your power. Neither your power is your Self. In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are two persons to be identified, but they are part and parcel of one uniform thing known as ‘Brahma’.

But these horrible Tantrikas - again they come round here - have spoiled the relationship between Shiva and Shakti. Not that they were human beings, that's why they established all these funny ideas and talked about these nonsensical things. Because they are the people who are nothing but their sex-points. They are nothing nobler than that. They are very depraved and diseased and debased people. They suffer from such a terrible disease that no way they can see anything else but this. Ashvameda has also described as something to do with sex. Everything they look, they see sex there. It's like a person, as we call it in Hindi - [HINDI 13:00 mins] - who is wearing the glass of sex and watching through that life, everything becomes sex, sex, sex, they are such debased and horrible depraved people, even God, they are bringing to that level. Unless and until they are bringing to that level, they cannot exist. How will they justify themselves, the way they are? Sex has nothing to do with Shiva and Shakti. What is Sun and sunlight? Is there any sex involved there? Is there nothing existing without sex for these horrible tantrikas? Is there no relationship that exists without sex?

So, Shiva is the God Almighty - we should call him as Sadashiva.

I'll try to draw a little bit, let us see how it works out.

Now forming into a nucleus like this.

Now, this is the remains of the nucleus, you can say, which forms its power here into a valaya. How does it form? He moves supposing backwards, you can say. Then what happens when he moves backwards...kara noko (marathi: don’t do that)...this, whole thing like this, remains here and all of this passes, forms a shell around it and the waves cross over and settle onto the shell - here. Now, this is the situation: when all inside forms another nucleus here by concentration - this is the Shakti. And this is the Sadashiva. This is the Mahashakti, you can say ‘Adi Shakti’ and this is the Sadashiva.

Now here, Shiva, once the Shakti forms Her personality, or we can say, Her ego is established, She is a different identity from Shiva. Because the whole process is to create the play for the witness to see. He is the One who is going to watch the play. She is the One who is going to create it. So, She accumulates Her ego onto a point here and becomes Shakti, assumes a position there. And the first thing She does as a Shakti is to go round in a parabolic...in a parabola around Her Lord.

This point one must understand. She is a Shakti, is the Power of God. And the whole Creation is only meant for God Almighty to be seen. He’s the only spectator of the play of Shakti. And if He doesn't like the play, for example, He doesn't like the way it is or the way people are that are created, He can immediately stop the play by closing His eyes, by denying the play, by showing His annoyance or by His stopper, He can just stop it. That's why He is also called as a destroyer. But the whole thing is meant for His amusement. And if it doesn't give Him pleasure, He can stop it. That's why the first one who must be pleased is the One who is the spectator. Because of this, Shiva is garlanded by Her, is a parabola and that's why parabola is the symbol of Adi Shakti. This is sort of a certificate to Her, a sort of a granting Her the varadan, as we call it in Sanskrit language, is the varadan that 'go ahead with your work.' This is a sanction given to Him. When She completes this parabola, the sanction has been granted and that's why She is a parabola.

Here the question of men dominating the women and women dominating the men does not come in, because this is predominantly in our heads, you see. When we think of it, we think of men and women,  it is nothing of the kind. It's just complete Oneness. Can we think of one couple which is absolutely united with each other? We cannot. Because we are all incomplete people. But if you could stretch your imagination to such a point that both of them are meant for each other only and the One who is active, is the Adi Shakti, is only active to please the God Almighty Who is the only spectator of Her play and He’s to be pleased first. So, She surrenders Herself before Him, takes the sanction through the parabola.

Now, parabola is a very important thing. You know that everything travels through parabola, never in a straight line. For example, if you love someone, our love goes round that person and comes back to us as love. But if you hate that person, then our hatred goes round that person and comes back to us as a terrible hatred. So, the parabola is taken, but you might say 'why a parabola?' The question can be: "Why should there be a parabola and not a circle?" The reason is: parabola is the shortest distance to go round another point, is the shortest. And that's why it's a parabola.

It is even in our ordinary life, you will find this happening: that whatever you do to others, it comes back to you in some form, whether you do good or bad. And that's why our karmic ideas and that of our doing punyas are all there. Because whatever we emit through us, will come back to us. In the same way, if you bless the whole world, the blessings of the whole world will come to us.

As I told you, the process is not that simple as it can be drawn, because it's a living process of a big dimension but I'm just trying to make it simpler for you to understand.

Now, this parabola, when, here now, when She is, She goes into the motion of a parabola and Shiva sanctioned Her, sanctions Her - it's a living process, again you must understand, it's a living process, it's as human as we are. Both of them are as human as we are, we should say, they are thousand times more human than we are.

So, here the Wife, His Consort, says that: “I am very happy just like this. I won't go any further with it.” Because Creation is not an easy thing for Her, She doesn't want to depart from Her Creation. Creation is the child and She says, “I would not like to have children now, because I will lose you.” So, She pushes Herself towards Him and He pushes Her back and disappears, opening out from here.

Now She is in this form. So, the beginning of the Om starts. Parabola, first of all, gets converted into Om. Then She pushes Herself down and settles down for a while to meditate and to find out how She is going to work it out, we can say like this.

You see, it is Her desire which must be aroused. If Her desire is not aroused, She will not conceive the Creation. So, a kalpa is spent in that. Quite a lot of time is spent in Her own thinking - which way She should do it. She has created many universes. It is not one universe She has created. She has created universes after universes and I will show you how She has created so many universes. And some of them are still lingering on, some of them are destroyed. But today before us: this Universe, this Earth, on this Earth, India and in India, Delhi, you are sitting attending this place. It's like that.

So, at this moment, whatever is the thing, is not the past, nor the future, but I'm telling you about the present moment we are here. But many universes have been created by Adi Shakti; even before us. And She has tried many other things also. Ultimately She has tried this. She has created Earth and then created us. Now, how She has done that we'll see later on. Just now let us see how She assumes her powers.

When She decides to create, She is endowed with three powers: She has three powers of God which are granted to Her. By one power, first of all, is the existence, the desire to exist, She desires to exist with God. The second power is to create and the third power is to sustain. First power is existence, second is to create and the third is the evolving power or sustenance power by which gradually you sustain something and you become something. These are the three powers She assumes. In short, we can say that She forms three powers of Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi. These are the three powers She assumes within Herself.

Now, She uses again Her parabolic systems. You know, supposing, I have come to this house by this way, I know this way. Then I take that way, I know that way. I know the middle way, everything. Now, I know these three ways and I know all about it: with that knowledge, I can do something else. So, She again uses Her parabolic movements. Actually, Her three movements,  of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, are all the time with Her, with the Adi Shakti. She can separate them and put them into three different channels. She can combine them and synthesise them and use it as a parabola - you understand this? That's why when we put a bandhan to you, we say “put a parabola,” is a parabola, because the vibrations are all in... all the three powers are flowing this way.

So, we have got, you know that, three powers - the Mahakali power you can say, I need not write, “Mahakali power”. By Mahakali power She desires, as I've told you, is the emotional side of God, you can say. She represents the emotional side of God, She desires. Is the desire is that of God. God Almighty, Who is the spectator, He is the Sakshi. And She puts that Sakshi into your heart, She reflects that into your heart which is kept all the time burning to watch what you are doing. To see your play after your creation.

Her Mahasaraswati power, now, moves in a parabola. She can move in any angle, 360 angles She can move, from one point. Sometimes, She goes round and round at a point. When She goes round and round at a point, Her Mahasaraswati power can get consolidated; you can say, it becomes dense. You see, that's the trouble with English language! It becomes dense, it becomes so very dense that it cracks out. These cracks occur due to the momentum of the movement of the Mahakali power, Mahasaraswati power. Because it is moving in a round and round fashion, they also get into the momentum of that movement, they start moving. For example, this part starts moving, this part starts moving, this part starts moving. And when they start moving, they become rounds, they lose their angularities and then they become round.  Now I'm telling you, very much in short because it’s a...they become round. These rounds again are put into friction with each other. And that is how, we can say - now forget about other universes, where other styles were also created - but about this one we can say, was created.

Now, you must all the time remember that this Power thinks, understands, organises, loves and is an identity. So, She creates the Earth. Earth is not created so easily. Part of the Sun is removed just like this, with the hand, you can say. We must understand why the Sun became so cold. Sun is, from the Sun it is removed very much far away first, to the farthest point so that it freezes completely. Also like Moon, it was taken very far away. It just freezes completely and is then brought near the Sun again, like a pendulum. It is moved again towards the cold side, again it is brought to the hot side. It is brought to a point, to the medium point where Earth is made, is made - again I'm saying, it's not a chance of nature - is made deliberately, habitable for human beings, the temperature was brought in. It has been done by Adi Shakti, the Mother. She has done it deliberately, it's not easy to conceive of such a Mother. But She has done it. And She brings this Earth to a point where life can begin.

So the combination of Moon and the combination of Sun gives you hydrogen from the Moon, oxygen from the sun, gives you water, the freezing and heating. The freezing and heating gives you the water. In the water, when the Earth is made, spirally, to move upward, again the heating and cooling starts. By heating and cooling, life comes into being as amino-acids.

Is done deliberately! What I am saying: it is not done by something, by chance. On this also one has to think once: “How is it?” It is not chance! If you read  Du Nouy [Pierre Lecomte Du Nouy (1883-1947)] , is a very big biologist, I mean, I think he’s one of the greatest biologists who has really gone into the calculations of how much time should it take for a simple amoeba to be created out of the matter and he has calculated that it should take much more time than even what we have had so far - billions of billions of years are needed just by chance. Law of chance is there, which I don't know if I should tell you elaborately, but law of chance is that, if you have in one tube 50 red pebbles and 50 white pebbles and if you start shaking them and make them absolutely in a chaotic order, it takes so much, so much times shaking to make it again the same as it is, or to bring it into order.

So, even to create an orderly living protoplasm, a cell, would have taken much more time than it has taken so far: much more, many times more, billions of billions. And it has taken only 5 billion years for Earth to secede from the Moon. And only 2 billion years for it to cool down. So, he says, it is beyond any understanding - only thing that can explain it, what we can say, is that there is a ‘Juggler’ behind it. And there is a Juggler, about which our great rishis and munis know that - that Juggler is nobody else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother. The Primordial Father is Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother is Adi Shakti. And are we going to discuss about their sex? Are we going to do that way with the tantrikas? Is that the way to pay homage to your parents? We have to understand that it's a very, very solemn subject, we are discussing here the sanctum sanctorium of the love of our Primordial Parents. It's a very, very holy thing. We are not holy people, we are yet full of lots of greed and lust, but they are above everything. So, when we are discussing them, we have to know, we have to do it with great shraddha, and with our head bowed before them that it is our luck and we are very fortunate that we have been able to learn something about these two Primordial Parents who have brought forth this Creation, their child.

So, one of these then again cracks and becomes a surya-mandal, and a surya-mandala has got, as you know, Earth and Moon and all these things and I have told you how Earth is created. After the Creation of Earth, first, you know that amino-acids were formed, the vegetation started and then the human being started.

Now, the matter, also, is a very systematic thing. Matter is not unsystematic, it is systematic, but it is not organised - there is difference between the two. The systematic things are dead, can be dead. You can put five stones here in a systematic manner, but they are not organised, because they are not living things. There's a difference between the two.

So, first, the systematic things were laid down. Perhaps, if you know about the...Eight different types of elements were created. These were created and were put into proper places through Shri Ganesha. You know that the carbon... carbon is in the centre of these periodical elements that appear. That means a element which has got one valency, two valency, three valency and four valency, the three are the plus ones, then you've got one C, carbon, which has got four valences. Then you have got, again, minus one, two, three and four - is a complete eight.

Like that, the whole matter has been organised. To organise the matter, some deity was to be created for that, and first deity that was created was that of Shri Ganesh.

Let us see now how She created here. You have seen that one part of Her, which is the Mahasaraswati, has created the matter. Mahasaraswati has created the matter. Now, Mahakali has to give them existence. How do you get an existence?  Is through your sustenance or, you can say, through your quality - whatever you are. So, Mahakali gives that existence to those material things, not human beings or living things but matter, through a deity known as Shri Ganesh. Mahakali...

In the heart of the Viraata, as you see, - you'll see Viraata also He comes in, because that I will tell you later on - but in the heart of Viraata, is the Primordial Being, the complete Primordial Being, the Mahakali is settled down. What She does, She goes three and a half from the heart: one up, one down like that - three and a half times and comes to the end of the three and a half, down-way. Three and a half. Now, She comes at the end of it. And if you put three and a half like that and if you cut it straight, you get 7 centres cut in.

Is there a drawing person who knows how to draw? You should start from like that, you can put it like this. She comes down here.

She comes down here and from here She penetrates. You see, She cuts at seven points here. At this point, She creates the first deity, little below, of Shri Ganesh. I mean, this is not done in one day, is not done in one year, not done in one Yuga, it is done in many Kalpas.

The first step is to create Shri Ganesh, this is Her abode and She puts Shri Ganesh. Now, he is emitting his vibrations through all this. He passes through all this whatever She has created. On this picture is settled the work of the Mahasaraswati, you can say. She comes down with all Her programs like this and She makes it. And She gets joined here again. So, Shri Ganesh emits His vibrations through her.

First, Shri Mahakali creates Shri Ganesh and then Mahasaraswati comes down, She creates all these things and gets connected to Shri Ganesh. So, the vibrations of Shri Ganesh start flowing through all the creation of Mahasaraswati.

Before creating all this, the complete thought of what is going to happen in future comes in a clear-cut vision of the Adi Shakti. And She puts Her plans through. First of all, the Mahalakshmi power comes down and creates the Shri Ganesh. You can understand now how important it is that we have to be holy people. First, She created the holiness on this Earth. First thing, Her relationship with the child was established, because the Creation is going to be created in the image of Her child. That's why Shri Ganesh was created first. And then from here, say, is the Adi Shakti, the other power, Mahasaraswati, on Her way, She comes down and gets connected with Shri Ganesh. And that's how the Shri Ganesh establishes the relationship and emits His vibrations through this. Because of His vibrations passing through the matter that She has created. For example, our Mother Earth: through this passes the, you know that through it passes the axis. Nobody has seen the axis, but they say, there is an axis, from the way it moves. There is a kind of an axis.

Now, this is the power of Mahakali passing through the [axis]. We can say, it's the power of Shri Ganesh passing through the axis of the Mother Earth, which has got magnetic power in it. And that's how, through that, it controls its speed, its movement, and also it looks after us. Why don't we think that when we put a little seed in the soil it sprouts, automatically?

You have seen now, many of you who have been suffering from certain troubles and diseases, that the Mother Earth herself took down your problems, She sucked them out. It is a fact, you can see it in Sahaja Yoga, that after realisation if you have any problem, if your head is heavy, if you are a realised soul, otherwise She doesn't listen, because you should be activated or you should be granted a certificate from the Adi Shakti that you're a realised person, otherwise why should She accept you? You just put your head on the soil, put your both the hands on the Mother Earth and you'll find the whole thing will be sucked out from your forehead. It has been done with many, even from the legs it can take out.

Mother Earth is actually, is the Mother of Adi Shakti, you can say. She is the Mother, they say, because She is made in such a way that She takes all the weights of the world in Herself. She controls all the weights of the world and She can consume all your weight. She’s the dharaa. 

Now, weight means everything that... your weight is what we weigh in: that's not the thing. Weight means also your sins, also your punyas. It means everything. If you have too many sins in you, then Mother Earth feels hurt. Wherever there is too much of sin, then Mother Earth has to ask help. And then some other deity has to, like Vishnu himself,  has to come on this Earth to save Her from this too much of overloading of sins upon this Earth. Is a fact! It is not I'm telling you a mythical story, is a fact. Which you have to verify after getting vibrations. Before getting vibrations, you cannot find out from the Mother Earth. If you want to find out some time, if you are realised,  you just stand on the Mother Earth and ask her "Will you take away my sins, oh Mother Earth? Will you take away my karmas? I have been realised." Immediately, She’ll start drawing you. You'll be surprised. You'll feel so much lighter. You have to use Her. That is how Mother Earth has been created.

But also Adi Shakti through Her Mahasaraswati power has created the five elements. Before everything else, She created tanmatra (subtle elements)  as you call it, I mean, if I go into details, it’s going to be too much for you! But first of all, the causal essences were created by Her. But if I say like this, there won't be anything false. If I say that just by seeing by Her sight, by her drushti (sight), She has created this light. Just by Her breathing, She has created air, because Her desire is the last point. Because She desired there should be air, She created air. Like that, She has, Her smell has created the causal, gandha, which has created this mother Earth. And it has started from Her only, from Her desires, by Her desiring it - it was created for Her and that's how it was created in the whole Universe, which was later on made into Earth, Moon, Sun and all these things.

Actually, it was Her mere desire which brought forth these.

For us it is impossible to understand someone like that, who, just by mere desire can create. But when we think of somebody who is above all the powers of the world, the One the, who is the highest of all: She can do anything She feels like. Can't we think like that? We cannot think of someone like that. We think of God, who is Almighty, we call Him, but when we talk of His mights we start laughing. How can it be?

But She can do anything She wants to. It is only Her mere desire that has brought forth all these creations and all this things that you see in this world are created only by Her desire. She created akasha. She created all these five elements, which you know, and then She started Her another form which we call as the Mahalakshmi form.

Before that, I think, I should tell you about Shri Ganesha's existence in the matter. He acts in the matter as vibrations, as Mahasaraswati vibrations.

They are electromagnetic vibrations, Mahasaraswati vibrations are electromagnetic vibrations, we can say, that electromagnetic and also there is sound, and all these five elements are expressed in that. You can record them - because if you take a sulphur dioxide, for example, a sulphur dioxide and two oxygen and one sulphur and if you watch them properly under a very highly micro - you can try, I don't know if people have tried, but you can try to find out - and put it under, let's say, a very highly developed micro - microwave- microscope, you can say, you can see that the oxygen things and sulphur, - sulphur is stationary, - but these two are vibrating. They are vibrating, there’s a vibration going between these bonds. They can be isometric also, they can be symmetric, they can be even, uneven and they can be expanding, and closing like that. So, there are three types of vibrations, we find. And the fourth side is nothing but Shri Ganesha himself who is controlling.

So, this we can see with our naked eyes, if you want to see, even if you are realised or not. From where do these vibrations come in the minutest paramanu, as you call, the molecules? In a molecule, how do you get these vibrations, can you explain this? It is so much, sukshma, parasukshma.

The powers of Ganesha are very, very subtle and they enter into the matter and create this kind of vibrations, which you can even see and record, electromagnetic vibrations, in, even, a one small, little molecule.

So, we have in these, as I told you, into the periodic level, periodic laws of elements, you can find out that all the elements are divided into eight types. Just see! How can all the elements be divided into eight parts without somebody being there? Can you do something without organising a proper chart of these elements? Just think about it! You see, when we challenge God, we have to understand that in this world everything is so well organised, there are eight elements spread out so well, placed so well. And it has a particular style of behaviour and every element is different in numbers and protons and these numbers are very well calculated in such a manner that the end of it, that the last circle, that the last circle of all the protons should be eight. If it is not eight, if it is less than eight then it creates a valency problem.

It is so well organised, then, even if you study this, if there is anybody who knows little bit of chemistry, you know, so if you know chemistry, it's such a wonderful thing. We take it for granted! We think it is our right to have the matter so well organised for us! But the valencies are all depending on such a nice organisation of this eight protons at the outer thing.

This is all done through the Mahasaraswati power. But the vibrating force...Now see, there is a vibrating force: this is all done through the, as I told you, through the Mahasaraswati power. She creates. Now the vibrating force: He exists, matter also exists. It must exist. If it does not exist, nothing can exist. So, the existence force is given through the Mahakali force, which is acting through Shri Ganesh, who is sitting at the nucleus. He is sitting at the nucleus of every [atom]. Can you imagine how much it must be?  Every molecule and every atom. You cannot understand the finiteness of it.

Now, see, say, take one element like gold, how many molecules it has? Can you calculate? [It’s] beyond us! How many, you can say, atoms it has? We just cannot calculate it. And then how many Ganesha's pictures must be there? How is it achieved?

Is another thing which I will tell you if I come in the way. How infinite reflections are caught into and why there are two things like Shiva and Adi Shakti? The reason is it has to create an infinite reflection. How do you create an infinite reflection? Do you know that? Anybody who knows physics? If you place in the centre of two mirrors something, then the reflections are infinite. So, the first mirror is the Adi Shakti and the second mirror is this Creation, and that's how you can get infinite reflections on this Earth. This is the reason why you can get infinite reflections. And that's why you had to create another one who reflects it. And that's why there have to be three identities, one, the God Almighty, then Adi Shakti and then the whole Universe.

It had to be that way, otherwise you cannot create infinite reflections.

Now, somebody who has done this job must be a very clever man, no doubt. When human beings think that they can know God through their buddhi, they must know, how can you reach this Buddhi, it's supreme.

How much labour He has taken to create us! After creating the matter, then He, or I should say, His power as Mahalakshmi descends on this Earth. Mahalakshmi helps in sustenance. Sustenance means all the scanning of all these elements.

When they create the matter, the matter is differently created, created for different purposes. Now, what is the ultimate? The Creation has its ultimate aim is to create human beings - this creation, just imagine!  You people are so great that for you all these troubles have been taken. Such an important thing is a human being that all these troubles are taken, - all matter, all, everything,  is used just to create you. This is the ultimate aim. Sort of a stage has to be laid down and you come, the Sahaja Yogis come on the scene, you can say.

Just the instrument of man is to be created. Now, why God wanted to create an instrument of man? Because He wanted to create an instrument which could feel Him, which could understand Him, which could emit, like Krishna creating his murli (flute). He just wanted to play through our instruments His power. But He didn't want to do it through the dead instruments like these but through the living instruments. Supposing, if this (microphone) can understand, can love, has a human mind, and if my voice is passing through it like a hollow personality then we can say that this is a realised personality. But this is not a living being, you are a living being. You are made specially with all these difficulties for millions of years, have been worked out so carefully, so delicately, one after another.

We have to now jump to the evolution part, because you see, it's a very long thing.

Shri Mataji: Kiti wasle (Marathi: what time is it?)

Yogi: Saha wasle (six o’clock)

So, now we have to come to the most important part which is evolution, which we should understand, because we know evolution through science.

When these three forces came into being,  before creating any earth or before creating this universe or anything,  first they had to draw out a proper picture about it and a proper understanding of it, you see. As before doing anything, say, we have to plan out things, we have a planning commission, first of all, we sit down with a planning commission. In the same way, first, they had to form a stage where they just plan out the things. This stage we can call it as the vaikuntha state. Because this (current stage) is not the earliest state, this is created later on.

First, the planning state is known as the vaikuntha state. At this stage they created all the incarnations. Incarnations were not created after the Earth has been created, which is a very wrong idea. They created all the incarnations at the vaikuntha state. Where you or I never existed at that time, this Earth never existed and nothing existed that you see with your naked eyes now. But a state of existence, the first one, known as the vaikuntha state, existed. In that vaikuntha state the planning of the whole Universe and the whole cosmos and all that was decided.

So, the first person who had to come on this was Shiva, because without him nothing can exist, but where to settle Him down, because He is to be reflected onto something. If Shiva has to be reflected onto someone, you have to create a reflector. So, they had to, first, think of the one Primordial Being or a, one Huge Identity you can call it, known as Viraat. They created Viraata. This will be the Viraata, this will be the complete form of the Primordial Being. This is the one I'm telling you about, this Reflector, The First One. The God Almighty has to be reflected, so, first, let us create, first of all, the Primordial Being, the Viraat.

In the Viraat they created different incarnations. Incarnations are not created from human beings. I don't know why people think like that. They cannot be created by human beings. But they were first created. You see, evolution is alright from amoeba to human beings, but there is no evolution for incarnations. They are made like that from the very beginning.

As you have seen in the Viraata, I have shown you the picture of the Viraat, the three powers of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati met at the Agya Chakra, and there they produced two children each - it’s not a story, is a fact, again - as brothers and sisters. And these brothers and sister means the relationship is of a temporary nature but of a subtler temperament. And then they were married, inter-communication took place. Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Mahakali created all together six children, who were married. Inter-marriage took place. By that inter-marriage they got an entity which was a kinetic personality and a potential energy within it, such a combination. And they placed those incarnations on different chakras. They brought from these, from the top, all of them were brought from the Agya downward and placed onto all the chakras. These incarnations, as you know, are placed on different chakras of the Viraata.

Many people won't understand this and won't like to hear this also, because human beings are so egoistical that they cannot understand that there is a God, Who is Almighty, Who is going to do everything, He has His own ways of doing it. Now, whether I'm telling the Truth or not, you can verify it on vibrations. You can see for yourself how Incarnations were created. And all these Incarnations were placed in the Viraata state. Here, to create the reflection on the other side, Shiva was removed from the Shakti, as it was removed in the beginning and it was placed on top of the Viraata's head as the Sadashiva's peetha. In the same way, we, too, have a Sadashiva's peetha on our head. You see, we are the reflection of the reflector.

So, we, too, have the same style, we, too, have a Sadahsiva's peetha on our head. He’s also placed here only. But when the Kundalini enters into the being, when he is in the womb of the mother, that time this Sadashiva peetha, or we can say, Sadashiva from this peetha descends into the heart. And that's how you hear the first throb in the heart. It is just the same as it happened in the Viraata. But at the vaikuntha stage this was not created, the second reflector here was not created, only the first one. So, only the Viraata was created and in His Being, in the planning stage, first of all, these officers, you can say, in charge of these chakras were created by Adi Shakti.

God is the witness and She is doing the play and She creates those chakras. In the chakras She places all these deities to govern.

Now, there is the existence, there is the creation, creative force, and there is the evolutionary force - all inside the Viraata state.

Now, this is at the vaikuntha state, we say, because this state is on this first reflection. It is not in us, or we cannot feel it, the vaikuntha state, because it is in the first thing.

Then another state was created, then third was created. But the fourth one is the bhavasagara, is the state at which all of us were born. First, in the fourth state…now, can you think of a four strata personality which is facing a mirror? Now, which is the first one [that] shows?  Is the topmost. And that's why the topmost shows is the bhavasagara. But if you can go deep down into your state, you can feel all the other three. But first of all, the one which you can see and feel it, is the bhavasagara. So, you are born in the bhavasagara. At this state you are at the bhavasagara state. At this bhavasagara state, now, you are created and you have to evolve. At this time the Mahalakshmi power acts to evolve you. You already know how evolutionary things have taken place but I will tell you how evolution has taken place according to our puranas (ancient scriptures), and which is a fact.

The Evolution of Man started, first from the amoeba, you can say; because the life came into being into water, as I told you [that] first the water was created. In the water the amino-acids were formed, amoeba were formed, fishes were formed and fishes, when they were formed, they found, the smaller fishes found it difficult to exist because of the bigger fishes were trying to eat it. It comes as a reciprocal thing, they were absolutely fed up of this destruction that was going on. At this time, Shri Vishnu Himself, the One who is the evolutionary force, descended on this Earth as the Matsya-Avatara. He helped some of the fishes to cross across the shores. By crossing across they had that courage, She was the leader. And then others started crossing across. This was the first evolutionary stage which we know.

These fishes became reptiles later on; as you know, in the evolutionary stages that they became reptiles. But how did they become reptiles? There must be someone who must have given them the lead. It was again Shri Vishnu, who came on this Earth as a Kurma and lots of things were done at this time in the vaikuntha stage, before He came on this Earth as a Kurma Avatara. At the vaikuntha stage, when they created this Earth, when they created, they planned this whole Viraata and wanted to create, on this side of the reflector the whole planning and the whole thinking and all that process brought forth some sort of a waste matter. It brought forth the waste matter. This waste matter got contaminated or, we can say, got stagnated on to one side which was neglected somehow, and through it started coming out some satanic forces and there was a big fight between the satanic forces and the good forces. It actually happened in the third stage, not at the vaikuntha stage, but at the third stage, because when the planning started, the working out started, these satanic forces started working out.

Now, people may say, "Why God created satanic forces?" He did not, but eventually they turned out to be because at the second stage, when some of the Devas, who were created. Again, they were not evolved people, they were created, Devas, in charge of all these elements and all the working, you see, you have to create also officers or people who have to go in the field and work out. All these Devas and Devatas: out of their working, what happened [is] that they got lost, some of them, and became satanic forces. Sort of a waste-product came in, and with that waste-product, satanic forces started and they acted in such a way that there was a war during the Kurma-Avatara between Rakshasas and the Suras, as they call it.

So, the good people who were in charge of the elements, all the working in the office of God started fighting with the satanic forces. At that time, He Himself worked out this and you know what happened in the amrut-mantan which took place, and this is, - people don't understand how can the amrut-mantan take place in the bhavasagara, - it did not. It took place at a stage which is not bhavasagara. At the bhavasagara it did not take place. Now, we are at the bhavasagara state. At the bhavasagara state the same Kurma, the same one took birth and came on this Earth and gave us a understanding how to become a proper reptile. Like that we grew up.

So, the whole thing will take too much time, I need not go into that. But, ultimately, a human being was created. All this is done by Mahalakshmi power, which has acted through Vishnu, which I have told you how evolution has taken place, how you are made. Now, what is going to happen?

You reach this point, up to this point, till Christ came in. Christ was also an incarnation and his Mother was nobody else but Radhaji Herself, the Mahalakshmi. And they brought forth up to this stage the human beings.

After this, now, what man has to become? - is to enter into a state where he becomes nirvichar, means there is no more the consciousness of the bhavasagara, but you go little beyond it. From this stage you dive into a state of Universal Unconscious, as they call it, it's nothing but the same power which exists here, which is a synthesis of all the three powers, is the synthesis of all the three powers. That is the Adi Shakti's power.

Adi Shakti's power is all-pervading, exists everywhere, but we never feel it otherwise. Why? Because we are very grossly placed. We can say, that a tube, which has got, say four layers, out of which it can only use the outer tube, because the inner tubes are all closed. When the innermost tube is opened out, you become absolutely Self-realised, but when even the second tube is opened out, you can feel the all-pervading force of God Almighty, which is, we call it as Sampovapi achetan. But it is no more achetan (unconscious) for you because you are conscious of it.

That is how you start your dialogue with God. What happens is that here, the reflection here, the reflector, that is reflecting work, from here you ascend into this part. You ascend onto this part. You do not become this but you ascend into this area. From here you ascend into this area. And this area is filled with the all-pervading power of Adi Shakti.

Till you reach to this stage, you have to go up to this stage of an incarnation, which, of course, is a big gap. But I can say that Mahavira and Buddha, both of them rose to that height. But look at their disciples! For example, Buddha’s disciples, they have decried Shiva, they have decried all the Gods and Goddesses, I mean as if they did not know much about it. And the way they have shown in certain statues - that a Goddess is standing on top of a Shiva and a Parvati and is trying to kill; She is hitting Shri Ganesha and this is something so non-sensical. I mean, they completely killed the image of One United Force, acting the whole thing, in One united idea, with One united mind. Only whenever they had not united, they became Rakshasas and formed the satanic force.

As I told you it's a very, very difficult subject and I've tried to handle it in English, is even worse. So, I've tried my level best to do it, but still if you have any questions, anything, you can ask me, some time, you can write to me, we can find it out.

For tomorrow...Now, this is the only thing is, I wanted to tell you about this, that now you have got thoughtless awareness, no doubt. Most of you have got thoughtless awareness, you have got vibrations, but you have to jump into Nirvikalpa. Nirvikalpa. And [to] that you have to jump through deep meditation and through deep exposure. Otherwise, you see, it is no use only having this little state of Nirvichara, you have to jump into Nirvikalpa. That is a stage, little, as I've told you here, that a little ahead of this reflector, you have moved. But still you are going up and down, so many of you. This is a state known as satori in the Zen system of religion, they call it as satori: where, you see, if a person is going up and down, is catching, doing this, that. This stage has to be overcome. Then you go to the Nirvikalpa state. At the end of the Nirvikalpa state you just don't catch much. You are not bothered.

So far, I haven't met any human being like that. You see, I have seen very great saints and realised people and I can say that they are definitely Self-realised, they are even controlling nature, some of them do, but still they catch on their chakras, is something surprising. But, you see, human beings are like that, they’ll go on catching and again, perhaps, they jump into the third state of Self-realisation completely, but they are again in a satori state and they come back and go back and, like that, may be. But I have seen that, so far, I have not met one human being whom I will say he is fully Self-realised, who doesn't catch. Except for me, I find, everybody is catching. It's most surprising.

But when you don't catch - what happens, when you don't catch? Actually, this is a state rather difficult to achieve. But if you don't catch, if you think you don't catch - how you should do it ?- is to see this way: that if, supposing, you are catching Agya, maybe. You must know that when you are catching your Agya, you should not think you are catching your Agya, but you should think that you are gathering a force here to combat the another person. If you can do like that. Supposing you are catching on the Vishuddhi chakra, instead of thinking that you are catching on Vishuddhi chakra and getting upset about it, if you start thinking that this is a force you are accumulating just to counterbalance his Vishuddhi chakra. Then, I think, it will work out better. That's why I always say that: extend your hands to others and see for yourself. This has helped many people because if they catch on Agya and if they give vibrations to somebody who is Agya caught, they find they are released. Such things are happening to very few but it's happening.

So, this is what you can try: that don't think you are catching but you should think: a force has been accumulated to expel the Agya of another person who is facing you. In the beginning, of course, it's a very, very slow process, but gradually you can do it and only people who start giving others. This is a collective thinking, is a collective thinking: that, supposing, now you can say like that, that if, supposing, there is a malaria attack on Me, then My own blood, My own blood cells are trying to combat it. And they are combating it. You see, if I give in, if I give in, then I become malarious. But if I do not give in, I become victorious.

In the same way, if you could think this way while giving vibrations: that if you catch it is actually a force being accumulated into you and then you have to give it, then you are going to be much faster than all the munis put together, I can tell you. But that thinking is rather difficult for human beings, because once they catch, they get little worried, “I’m catching,” they start taking out their own. If you don't take out your own and go all out to give it to others, it will work out better. And this I've been, I've experimented with one or two people, I'm saying, and it has worked. Everybody does not have that capacity. So, gradually you rise, because you are just now newly born children, you have still to grow, you have to grow more. You might be learned, you might be knowing a lot, that doesn't mean, as far as your spirituality is concerned, you have just have come out of your satori state, some of you, and some of you are still in the satori state. So, be careful about it. I would like to meet you again, perhaps, after two years, I don't know when.

Tomorrow we are having a meditation here, then I won't speak much. Tomorrow we have a meditation. We have a meditation centre here, where you should go and meet, when you meet in a group then it is a samuhik, is a group activity, I will be there. You'll be surprised that my vibrations cannot be felt anywhere so much as they can be felt in a group, about which I know that such and such group is working here.

So, we have already three groups which are working in Delhi. And they are made quite closer to the places. After all, we must know that we don't have to go to Himalayas, as people went down, we don't have to do all these things. Only thing we have to go is to a place which is very much closer to us, it has been brought to our doors. The whole thing has been brought to your doors: the knowledge, the vibrations, the realisation and everything is made so easy. It's made easy.... But it should not mean that we should take it for granted. It has been made easy through a very, very great tapasya on my part, I should say.

In many ages I've been living now for thousands of years and I've been working it out on so many human beings and so many things and, at long last, I've been able to find out most of the permutations and combinations of most of the human beings and that's how it has been worked out in such a large mass-scale. It would not have been possible if I had not worked it out in that way. And that's how if it has worked out it has to click with most of the people except for one type is very, very difficult, I must say, those who are bound to people who are rakshasas. If they are born rakshasas and if your head has touched their feet, it's a very difficult thing. So, I would warn you, that before you touch feet of anybody, you'd be careful about it.

May God bless you all!

It's already very late for all of you and such a difficult subject to be brought to such a short time, it's very difficult. I hope to write some book on Sahaja Yoga: ‘I hope’, I am saying, because, so far, I've never written any book. [I’m] trying to write some book, but before that some other people are writing. I hope, I may be able to write something. In any case, you try not to bother too much about these things. This is not so important as your own realisation and your own ascent [because] the whole knowledge will be dawned upon you. You don't have to bother! Every word now you read, you will have a meaning about it and you will understand.

The first thing is that you must get your realisation, second thing is you must ascend. You must ascend much more and give more time to this. Do not take it for granted. It is a very important thing which you should do. After all there are other things, they are important. But this is the most important thing which has to be done.

By God's grace, if it works out I'll be very happy. As it is, I'm extremely happy because in none of my lives I've been able to give realisations to so many people. So as it is, I am over-satisfied with Myself. But as far as you are concerned, you should not be satisfied, you should ask for more and more and more and it will be granted.

Because you are the people who are on the stage, you are created for this purpose. One has to do it. God has to do it. If He does not do it, He cannot fulfil His own desires. And His Creation, He is not going to destroy.

May God bless you!
