The ancient land of India, the land once divided amongst waring kings and princes a land troubled over centuries by the occupation of foreign powers until in the middle of the 20th century India achieved independence and freedom from those who had ruled her for 300 years.

Despite all their differences of language and religion Indians became united in their efforts to be rid of this foreign rule through the courage and determination of one man Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi challenged the might of the British Empire not with guns but with non-violence with passive resistance and his unshakeable belief in a people's right to be their own masters. Another of India's great leaders at that time Bal Gangadhar Tilak proclaimed to a British Court on his arrest "freedom is my birthright". "freedom is my birthright" By 1942 the Indian people saw that their freedom was at last possible and their British rulers began to fear it. The slogan "quit India" was soon to be found all over the country. Five years later India achieved her birthright of freedom. One of the young leaders of this campaign for political freedom was a medical student now known as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi who has since that time dedicated her life to another kind of freedom the freedom of the Spirit through self-realization and the practice of Sahaja Yoga. It's your birthright as a human being to become the Spirit. That what Sahaja Yoga is. "Saha" means "with" and "ja" is "born".

Born with you is the right to get this Yoga is the union with the Divine. Is your birthright as a human being you are as I told you at the epitome of evolution and it has to work out but please open your hearts and open your minds. For thousands of years India the great land of the Spirit awaited the fulfillment of its ancient prophecies that the great incarnation of the primordial energy the Adi Shakti would bring a yoga that would create an inner transformation and self mastery for all men This momentous event is also foreseen by many Indian poets including the great Rabindranath Tagore seen here with Gandhi. The unique experience of self-realization takes place when the primordial energy called Kundalini is correctly awakened by someone who has already experienced and mastered their own self-realization. Shri Mataji has explained that the Kundalini is the power of our spiritual ascent found in the triangular bone at the base of the spine called sacrum by the Greeks. It is the power of our pure desire. When awakened the Kundalini rises spontaneously through six subtle centers called chakras. The Kundalini then emerges through the fontanel bone area at the top of the head emitting a cool breeze that can be felt there as well as on the hands. In her desire to offer self-realization to mankind through Sahaja Yoga Shri Mataji constantly travelled the world. I am not here to take anything from you.

Nor for a vote from you I am not a politician. I am here to give you the key of your own wealth. There is big inner revolution that is coming up which is silent joyous and is going to change the whole humanity This was the dream of Lenin who was a realised soul himself that he wanted to have a stateless state. And realised people don't need any state. You are just there. So you see, we have to understand that life has to be enjoyable Hello. How are you? Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands or from their head please raise both your hands please. So many. May God bless you.

Shri Mataji was born in 1923 in the very center of India near the town of Nagpur in the state of Maharashtra. Actually I was born like this. In a very enlightened family I should say. My father a very enlightened man and he was member of the Assembly, Central assembly, Member of the constitution. Constituent assembly Parliament. My mother was a honours of mathematics and my father was a scholar of [unclear - languages] also. It was her father who took her to see Gandhi. When Shri Mataji he was a young girl Gandhi recognized something unique in her and suggested that the child spend some time with him at the ashram where she became a frequent visitor over the years. Living abroad and traveling so much allowed Shri Mataji little time at a home in India but the travelling did not stop. She regularly toured this vast country reaching out to the people in the crowded cities as well as country villages.

At the end of the 90s the crowds who came to her public programs numbered in their thousands but when Shri Mataji started teaching Sahaja Yoga in India back in 1970 it was only with a mere handful of people. With the initial 12 people who achieved their self-realization Shri Mataji was able to establish Sahaja Yoga in India. Then in 1973 Shri Mataji went to live in London. Her husband mr. now sir CP Srivastava had been elected secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization an agency of United Nations this brought Shri Mataji into the world of international diplomacy. But in the midst of her life as the wife of a diplomat then a mother of two children and then a grandmother Shri Mataji has devoted all her efforts to giving self-realization and bringing Sahaja Yoga to very confused societies desperate for change. One of the effects of Kundalini awakening through Sahaja Yoga has been to help people with all kinds of serious addictions such as drugs and alcohol and illnesses such as diabetes and cancer impressive results have attracted the attention of the medical profession around the world. Dr. David Spiro is a general practitioner in London who has studied the application of Sahaja Yoga as a form of treatment for several years and who has seen many cures for a variety of problems and a marked increase in the general good health and well-being of people who practice Sahaja Yoga. I've been involved with Sahaja Yoga and the work of Shri Mataji for about the past 10 years. In India there's been some scientific studies which have shown the physiological effects of Sahaja Yoga as a form of meditation and some other studies on two particular illnesses asthma and hypertension which have shown very interesting results they've shown for example much larger drops in blood pressure than have ever been demonstrated before by any other form of relaxation or meditation. People around the world have been finding that the awakening of the Kundalini and the practice of Sahaja Yoga have helped to solve a wide variety of problems of all kinds.

Now at the beginning of the 21st century Sahaja Yoga is being practiced in some 70 countries. They have all combined together integrated together so peaceful and they lost all these conditionings of their so-called man-made religions or their man-made boundaries of nations and man-made ideologist. It opens out with truth to everyone. The way there are so many political changes taking place so dramatically and so fast one should expect a very beautiful world.
