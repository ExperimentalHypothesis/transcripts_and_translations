b"Adi Shakti Puja. Cowley Manor Seminar. Cheltenham (UK), 1 August 1982.\n\n[Informally, before the puja speech to some persons]\n\nShri Mataji: Just help him, one person can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, somebody else. Marcus, Nick, anyone, just help him out, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much for one person, just help him, please.\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s there?\n\nAlan, go and tell Bai to bring My handkerchief from My... I\xe2\x80\x99ve got My pur- No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, it\xe2\x80\x99s here, with My purse, have you brought it? Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s here. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry!\n\nMan: Here\xe2\x80\x99s Your purse, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Have the Americans come, those who have done the Puja, have they come?\n\nSahaja yogi: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: Are they here?\n\nMan: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Oh, they are here. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. And, in these new centers, have you started with Puja anywhere?\n\nSahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.\n\nShri Mataji: No, yours is all right, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about England.\n\nWarren: Any centres in Britain? Where there are new people.\n\nShri Mataji: Cheltenham, for example. Where is Alan? Ask him.\n\nWarren: He\xe2\x80\x99s just gone out for a moment. Any centers in Britain, any new people here, right now?\n\nShri Mataji: If do you have introduced them to puja I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, but if they have never been introduced to puja, then you have to be careful. From their good point of view.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I had to say this, because yesterday the load was too much, you know I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak even, and lifting the Kundalini was like raising hundred donkeys on your head, it was too much. And all these half-baked people are such that they are like dog-in-the-manger, they won\xe2\x80\x99t have it and they won\xe2\x80\x99t allow others to have it.\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll argue before the program, before the meeting starts, before the puja starts, specially. Because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to enjoy the fruits of the puja; they\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil your attention, they\xe2\x80\x99ll argue, discuss.\n\n[Aside: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease sit down\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\nWhat is there to argue in Sahaj Yoga? You have to take, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point is, you have to take, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to argue.\n\nHow much you take is the point. And the worst part is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to grow and they want to pull you down.\n\nSo, unless and until they are introduced to the idea of puja beforehand - then they start understanding the worth of puja, otherwise they do not, how will they understand? You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond them.\n\nSo, you should not make them attend any puja, minimum, and also seminars I would say.\n\nBecause seminars are meant for people who are intensively in Sahaj Yoga, to intensify their awareness. Not for people who are half-baked, who are Doubting Thomases, all this kind of people are absolutely useless, you should never bring them to a seminar.\n\nWhether it\xe2\x80\x99s your son, father, brother, mother, sister, husband, wife, nothing doing. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring anybody who is not fully awakened Sahaja Yogi, because seminars are meant for very intensive work-out.\n\nAnd what I find, always these people will argue with Me, they are the first to question, they have something to say [Shri Mataji laughing], they are the ones. Sahaja Yogis are keeping quiet and receiving it.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind even that, but what happens in the seminar, you have to receive more. And they do not receive, their attention is outside, they are disturbing everyone.\n\nSo, seminars are even, in a way, more important than an ashram, because in ashram there\xe2\x80\x99s no other problem but to fight them out.\n\nBut here, in a new place we go, we have to fight out all surroundings, the place itself has to be cleansed, everything has to be done.\n\nOn top of that you have these horrible people around you, whom you have to convince.\n\nIf they are not convinced, why are they here? Why did they spend so much money to come down? Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry we had to do that way.\n\nI wish people could be simple, straightforward, uncomplicated, and sensitive, but they are not. They are not sensitive people. They don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what are they up to.\n\nBy that they destroy themselves, no doubt, but they destroy part of you also, and also trouble Me.\n\nYesterday it was too heavy, you know that. Such a deep subject and it was too heavy for Me. If they say they feel bad, all right, tell them: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are sorry, we can\xe2\x80\x99t help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSee, there are certain points where we have to have our freedom to allow those who can come in.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the point where we close the door. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong in it, because you have to equip more to pull them out. It has been always our practice, since long, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new about it, everyone knows, not only in England, or any other place, even in India: we never allowed anybody to come for the Puja who was not a realized soul, and who was not a Sahaja Yogi, from the very beginning.\n\nWherever we tried that, we found it was very difficult. So I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody sitting here with a doubting mind. If somebody\xe2\x80\x99s there he should with all sincerity leave the hall and leave us alone, for the ascent. Anybody who has doubts should be kind and generous about it.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very serious work we are doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not of making money or of throwing an enterprise or building a house or something like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even just making creations of worlds, it\xe2\x80\x99s much more than that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very serious work we are doing and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody to cut our attention.\n\nEven some of the Sahaja Yogis I know, are half-baked. They must be corrected, all right, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, but they have been exposed to pujas, so it will do them good, not bad.\n\nBut some people are just anti-God, and they have allergies for God.\n\nAny work you\xe2\x80\x99d start doing in the name of God, they are so allergic, they react. These are anti-God allergies, and they express themselves (Shri Mataji laughs) by different, funny methods.\n\nNow, all the Sahaja Yogis must know this, then you will not go too far with them.\n\nYou will - you should discover this in anyone this allergy existing. You should say: \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, we have nothing to do with you\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSo that is for the people who have to have the privilege of this worship.\n\nToday is specially a great privilege because it was not so planned, but it worked out, just worked out.\n\nYesterday we did lots of cleansing.\n\nNow, today tell your mind to rest for a while. Tell your thoughts to stop for a while, and receive, receive more of it.\n\nEverybody has benefited by this reception but you have to receive more. There\xe2\x80\x99s a capacity within you to receive.\n\nPuja, as I have told you many-a-times, is not for My benefit, by any chance, take it from Me. I\xe2\x80\x99m much better off without it. Because when the enthusiastic deities start emitting vibrations with your asking - because you are saints, you see, just they are over-enthusiastic.\n\nAnd they are sitting there, busy-bodies, you know (laughter), they are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see they want to just rush. They emit so much that they lose \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cJust wait, just wait\xe2\x80\x9d. They want to save you, they want to give you, they\xe2\x80\x99re so anxious, in their anxiety you see - I like it, to see the way they are anxious.\n\nBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t suck it, and I have a problem there. Once they have given they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take it back. You don\xe2\x80\x99t suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it; so where does it go?\n\nIt hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.\n\nSo, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more.\n\nAnd just before the Puja you should say: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine\xe2\x80\x9d. Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s another beautiful gesture I have seen, in Uzbekistan, it\xe2\x80\x99s very good. They put both the hands on their heart like this (Shri Mataji puts both Her hands on her centre heart), and just press it, bending their head, asking.\n\nSee, it creates a vacuum. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they bow. [Long silence] It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful!\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s very nice today.\n\nSo, let the children come here.\n\nShri Mataji: Aja, didi agai, didi agai [Translation of the above sentence in English is: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, sister has come, Sister has come\xe2\x80\x9d].\n\nNow, sit there, all of you sit down, all right? Sit down now, sit down, sit down.\n\nNow, come along, Matthews is also coming, sit down there, sit down, come along, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, sit down. Now all the children are very sweet, and are going to sit down. Come along, sit down, sit down, nicely.\n\nWhere is didi? Didi kaha hai?\n\nYounger granddaughter: Upar.\n\nShri Mataji: Upar! Abhi aya nahi?\n\n[Translation of the above sentences into English as below: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is sister? Where is sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYounger granddaughter: Upstairs.\n\nShri Mataji: Upstairs! Not yet come?]\n\n[Continuing in English to the children:]\n\nAll right, now, you should give Me the flowers now (children start giving flowers to Shri Mataji), so would be better for you to have vibrations, thank you. Thank you very much, thank you very much. Poor Rishi has none.\n\nNow, you give Me these, to Me, give Me now. Give Me. Give Me, to Mother. All right, give that also.\n\nChild [indistinctly]: But you have the one.\n\nShri Mataji: Also give. So thank you, thank you, thank you very much.\n\n[She hands the flowers to a lady aside: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, just take this\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\nAll right, so now what should we do, Pujari is this. Just put a tikka to him (laughter).\n\nPut to everyone, not to the Pujari.\n\nPujari: Got it.\n\nShri Mataji: All right. All right. That\xe2\x80\x99s kajal? No, don\xe2\x80\x99t put kajal. (Laughter) He\xe2\x80\x99ll be like Bhairava! (Laughter) Good. May God bless you.\n\nAll right. Now, the children should sit like this, all right? On the side, for Ganesha Puja, like this, straight. So everybody can take photograph also, sit like this, all right? Ah. They have to take photographs. Yes, good, good. Oh, now sit here. Sit, sit down, all right.\n\nGood, it\xe2\x80\x99s very good. But you have to take out shoes! See, cannot have shoes here, take out shoes. Take out shoes, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s taken out shoes, take out, take out - take out shoes. Yeah. So come along. Sit like this, on the sides.\n\n[Hindi SOUNDS LIKE: Shuddhi mein Ganesha Puja?]\n\nPujari [in Hindi]: Ha, Shri Ganesha Puja.\n\nPujari in English: To begin with, we will do first the invocation of the puja, then the puja to Lord Ganesha. And this would be followed by the puja to the Adi Shakti, Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi.\n\nIn the Devi Bhagavat Purana it is written that the puja to the Adi Shakti is the greatest puja that can be done by any being.\n\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s why you are privileged.\n\nPujari: Even the Gods don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\n\nShri Mataji: None of them. They just touch My feet. None of them did Puja to Me. Believe Me.\n\n[Softly, to a little girl - ed] Very good. All right, sit down.\n\nPujari starts and yogis join in: Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Ganesha Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.\n\n[Most yogis start to repeat the Shri Ganesha mantra while a few begin the Mahamantra - ed]\n\nShri Mataji: One person should say (Pujari: \xe2\x80\x9cAccha\xe2\x80\x9d, yes), then you can repeat, that\xe2\x80\x99s better. What about Aradhna, where is she? She has not come? [Aradhana is H.H.Shri Mataji\xe2\x80\x99s eldest grand daughter.]\n\nChild: She is upstairs.\n\nPujari: We\xe2\x80\x99ll start again. First Lord Ganesha, then Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali. Then Lord Kalki and then Lord Kalki and Sahastrara Swamini.\n\nYogi: Three times Shri Ganesha?\n\nPujari: Hm?\n\nYogi: How many times the Ganesha mantra?\n\nPujari: Each once, I mean.\n\nYogis: Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Ganesha Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. \n\nOm Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, Trigunatmika, Kundalini Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.\n\nOm Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagavati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.\n\nOm Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat, Shri Sahastrara Swamini Moksha Pradayini Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.\n\nPujari: Now the names of Lord Vishnu.\n\nOm Shri Keshavaya Namaha, Om Shri Narayanaya Namaha, Om Shri Madhavaya Namaha, Om Shri Govindaya Namaha, Om Shri Vishnuve Namaha, Om Shri Madhusudanaya Namaha, Om Shri Trivikramaya Namaha, Om Shri Vamanaya Namaha, Om Shri Shridharaya Namaha, Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namaha, Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namaha, Om Shri Vasudevaya Namaha, Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namaha, Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namaha, Om Shri Purushottamaya Namaha, Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namaha, Om Shri Narasimhaya Namaha, Om Shri Achyutaya Namaha, Om Shri Janardanaya Namaha, Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namaha, Om Shri Damodaraya Namaha, Om Shri Upendraya Namaha, Om Shri Haraye Namaha, Om Shri Krishnaye Namaha.\n\nSakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nShri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names are taken before every puja, even before the today renovation of it?\n\nFirst you have to worship Shri Ganesha. But even before worshipping why these names are taken, is important to understand, everything has a why.\n\nBecause these are the twenty-one channels within your Sushumna, twenty-one channels, we should say, in this complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi. So to raise you, absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.\n\nSo one would say seven channels in the Sushumna Nadi. But these seven channels are divided multiplied by seven into three.\n\nSo every channel has got twenty-one (inner? Unclear) channels. So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one channels.\n\nLeft-hand side Nadis are as you know that \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you know the names or not.\n\nAnd the right hand side also, like Gayatri, Parvati and all these are on the right hand side.\n\nAnd the left ones are called as Chamundi, and all these left-sided things, there are seven of them.\n\nNow, the central path has got twenty-one channels and has got twenty-one powers. And their deities are named according to the twenty-one aspects of Shri Vishnu.\n\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why these twenty-one aspects are first said, so that within you all these twenty-one channels are awakened.\n\nWithin you, first of all.\n\nPuja is a double thing, that a cup has to be made and then this source has to be opened out. So you are the cup. The Sushumna is the channel you have by which you suck in. So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one names are said.\n\nNow, why first Shri Ganesha? Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning of the desire. And the end of the desire. You start with Ganesha and end up with Ganesha.\n\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.\n\nIs the other way round now, the source.\n\nWhen you direct your attention to the source you worship it, and when you want to incite or open out your own being, then you chant it.\n\nThis is the difference between worship and a mantra. If you just say mantra, you open yourself up.\n\nBut when you worship and chant, then you tap the source. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before or not.\n\nYogi: No, no, no.\n\nShri Mataji: No? All right. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you understand the puja part.\n\nNow, those who are newcomers, their cup is completely useless.\n\nAnd when you excite the deities, they get busy opening their cups, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s cups also. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a double work. But if your cup is ready, it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to fill in. So now these twenty-one names I think you should take again with the understanding, is better. All right.\n\nPujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah, Om Shri Narayanaya Namah, Om Shri Madhavaya Namah, Om Shri Govindaya Namah, Om Shri Vishnuve Namah, Om Shri Madhusudanaya Namah, Om Shri Trivikramaya Namah, Om Shri Vamanaya Namah, Om Shri Shridharaya Namah, Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namah, Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namah, Om Shri Vasudevaya Namah, Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namah, Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namah, Om Shri Purushottamaya Namah, Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namah, Om Shri Narasimhaya Namah, Om Shri Achyutaya Namah, Om Shri Janardanaya Namah, Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namah, Om Shri Damodaraya Namah, Om Shri Upendraya Namah, Om Shri Haraye Namah, Om Shri Shri Krishnaye Namah.\n\nPujari and Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. \n\nShri Mataji: Now.\n\nPujari: Now we have the mantra for pranayama.\n\nShri Mataji: This is the Gayatri, the right side. Is the right side, and these are all the seven centers on physical level.\n\nPujari: Pranayama.\n\nShri Mataji: Pranayama is the same thing. Is for \xe2\x80\x93 Prana is right side. It\xe2\x80\x99s physical side. You are opening the right side. You see, this Gayatri mantra you say. Bhur Bhuva Swaha and all these things. Now, Bhu is Pruthvi, Bhuva is Antariksha, you see, like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the centers [Pujari: \xe2\x80\x9cSwaha\xe2\x80\x9d], the essence of the centers, you see?\n\nNow, Antariksha \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised that you are the essence of all the Antariksha, your centers are. Yes.\n\nPujari [recites Pranayama prayer]: \xe2\x80\x9cPranavasya Parabrahma rishi Paramatma Devata, Devi Gayatri chandah. Pranayame viniyogah.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShri Mataji: You do it only with the one nose?\n\nYogi: Both noses. (Not clearly audible)\n\nShri Mataji: Both the noses. Prana: Prana is right side. Prana shakti is right side, Mana shakti is left side.\n\nSo Prana shakti you are exciting because this prana is the one which spreads in the body, gives you the balance, which takes in and gives out.\n\nPujari: Now we have the Gayatri mantra.\n\nAum bh\xc5\xab, Aum bhuvah, Aum swah, Aum mah, Aum janah, Aum tapah, Aum satyam, Aum tat-Savitru-varenyam, bhargo devasya dh\xc4\xab-mahi Dhiyo-yo\xe2\x80\x99nah prachoday\xc4\x81t \n\nAum \xc4\x81po jyotiras\xe2\x80\x99om\xe1\xb9\x9butam \n\nBrahma bh\xc5\xabr-bhuvah swar\xe2\x80\x99om \n\nPujari and Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. \n\nPujari: Om Sriman Maha-Ganadhipataye namah, Ishta devata-bhyo namah, kula-devata-bhyo namah, grama-devata-bhyo namah.\n\nShri Mataji: These are all pertaining to you. Kula Devata is your dynasty, from where you come. There is a god who looks after that. Then Grama Devata, of this village. There is a god who looks after this.\n\nIs all for you, pertaining to you. Then - Kula Devata\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\nPujari: Ishta Devata.\n\nShri Mataji: Ishta, the One - your Ishta Devata is Me. Ishta means to whom we worship.\n\nPujari: Then: Sthana-devata-bhyo namah.\n\nShri Mataji: The god, the god that resides in this area. Means the Divine part that it resides in this area.\n\nPujari: Vastu-devata-bhyo namah.\n\nShri Mataji: The one \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they do vastu here, but in every house in India they put a kind of a vastu, means they put certain things inside the foundation to protect the house.\n\nPujari: Mata pitrubhyam namah.\n\nShri Mataji: And your mother and father they are to be worshipped \xe2\x80\x93 they are to be saluted because you are part of them.\n\nPujari: Shri Lakshmi-Narayanabhyam namah.\n\nSarvebhyo devebhyo namoh namah. Sarvebhyo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Lakshmi Narayan is, why\xe2\x80\xa6 again see, Lakshmi Narayan. More insistence on Lakshmi Narayan, again, because of the Sushumna, again. The Void.\n\nLakshmi Narayana.\n\nSarva devobhyo Gurubhyo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nPujari: Ah. Sarva gurubhyo namah.\n\nShri Mataji: All for your ascent, you see?\n\nPujari: Sarvebhyo-brahmanebhyo namah.\n\nShri Mataji: All those who are realized souls to be really saluted.\n\nAll has to do with the ascent, see?\n\nHow clear-cut it is.\n\nPujari: Now the twelve names of Lord Ganesha.\n\nShri Mataji: Now. The twelve names of Ganesha because Ganesha must be awakened within you to begin with first, you see, He must be first of all, and then open the source of Ganesha.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s have it.\n\nPujari: Nirvighnamastu, Sumukhasch Ekdantascha, Kapilo Gajakarnakah, Lambodarascha, Vikato, Vignanasho Ganadhipah Dhumra-ketur-Ganadhyaksho, Bala-chandro Gajananah Dvadash-aitani Namani, yah patet shrunu-yad-api vidya-rambhe vivahe-cha, praveshe nirgame tata sangrame sankate-chaiva, vignas tasya na jayate.\n\nThen all the mantras of the various Devas and Devis.\n\nShukl-ambara-dharam devam, shashi-varnam chatur-bhujam prasanna-vadanam dhyayet, sarva vignopa-shantaye.\n\nSarva-mangala mangalye, Shive sarva-arta sadhike sharanye tryambake Gauri, Narayani namostute.\n\nSarvada sarva karyeshu, nasti tesham amangalam yesham hridisto bhagavan, mangalayatanam harih.\n\nTadeva lagnam sudinam tadeva, tara-balam chandra-balam tadeva vidya balam daiva-balam tadeva, lakshmi-pateh tenghri yugam smarami.\n\nLabhas-tesham jayastesham kutastesham parajayah\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nShri Mataji: Tesham.

Now let them do it, come along. Now\xe2\x80\xa6 [hindi].\n\nPujari: This is Shri Ganesha Atharva Sheersham.\n\nShri Mataji: \xe2\x80\xa6 That\xe2\x80\x99s little [unclear]\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nPujari and yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.\n\n[Shri Mataji works on a child washing Her feet, then says \xe2\x80\x9cBetter\xe2\x80\xa6(hindi)\xe2\x80\xa6 she\xe2\x80\x99ll be better\xe2\x80\x9d].

Specially the children [Hindi].\n\n[Pujari resumes mantras in Sanskrit]\n\nShri Mataji: Now let them do it. Aradhna? \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n[Pujari speaks probably in Hindi or Sanskrit. Shri Mataji replies and then in English: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 or puja we will do. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing beyond, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\nPujari: It is the worship of the picture as a representation of the universe, which is present in front in the form of Shri Mataji. [Then mantras in Sanskrit follow]\n\nNow the mantra of the earth, to stabilize our puja [long mantra to Pruthvi]. Now we are asking all the horrible things to go away, the bhuts and \xe2\x80\xa6 [laughter].\n\n[Mantras in Sanskrit follow].\n\nNow we perform six things to purify our body, we touch six parts of our body.\n\nOm Bhur Bhuva Swaha Hridayaya Namah.\n\nShri Mataji: First is heart, is important. (Shri Mataji puts Her right hand on the heart)\n\nPujari: Next, the head (Shri Mataji puts Her right hand on Sahastrara). Om Bhur Bhuva Swaha Shirsay Swaha. Next the back of your head, yes. (Shri Mataji puts Her right hand on the back of Her head) Om Bhur Bhuva Swaha Shikayay Vashak.\n\nOm \xe2\x80\x93 next to form a protection around us.\n\nShri Mataji: Vashak is like this, you see: Va (Shri Mataji makes a sort of bandhan around Her with Vishuddhi and Nabhi fingers of right hand, starting from left side, above Her head and down along right side), Shak (Shri Mataji hits Vishuddhi and Nabhi fingers of right hand on the left hand). Is a bandhan.\n\nPujari: So, Om Bhur Bhuva Swaha Shikayay Vashak (while the pujari recites, Shri Mataji makes again the bandhan-like gesture passing Her right hand along the left side, then behind Her head, then down along right side and ending up hitting Vishuddhi and Nabhi fingers of right hand on left hand. All yogis do the same)\n\nThen kavacha, Mataji\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Kavach. Is a bandhan, yes.\n\nLike this you can do it.\n\nPujari: Om Bhur Bhuva Swaha Kavachaya Swah.\n\n(Shri Mataji entangles the fingers of Her hands, rises them upwards along the center of Her body, then brings them on the back of head, then brings them down and hits right hand on left hand. Yogis follow gestures with Her)\n\nPujari: Next the eyes, and the Agnya chakra.\n\nOm Bhur Bhuva Swaha Nitrayaya Vashak.\n\n(Shri Mataji touches left then right eye)\n\nPujari: Next we put a bandhan.\n\nOm Bhur Bhuva Swaha Astraya Phat. (Pujari aside: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6bandhan\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nShri Mataji: Do like this. [She shows gesture: right hand rises along left side, then on top of head, then down right side and hits right hand on left hand]. Astra. Astra means the weapon.\n\n[Pujari recites more Sanskrit mantras]\n\nPujari: Now we invoke all the rivers. \n\nGange cha yamune chaiva godavari sarasvati narmade sindhu kaveri jale'smin sannidhim kuru.\n\nNow we salute the pitcher: kalashaya namah [Sanskrit invocation follows].\n\nNow we worship the conch. [Sanskrit invocation follows]. Next the bell.\n\nShri Mataji: What is it?\n\nPujari: Gantha. [A bell is rung, while the mantras are recited] This signifies the arrival of all the Devas and the departure of all the rakshasas. Next prayer to the lamp.\n\n[Mantras are recited]\n\nNow the main puja, puja begins. [Sanskrit mantras \xe2\x80\x93 then prayer to Vishnu:]\n\nShaanta-Aakaaram Bhujaga-Shayanam Padma-Naabham Sura-Iisham Vishva-Aadhaaram Gagana-Sadrsham Megha-Varnna Shubha-Anggam Lakssmii-Kaantam Kamala-Nayanam Yogibhir-Dhyaana-Gamyam Vande Vissnnum Bhava-Bhaya-Haram Sarva-Loka-Eka-Naatham\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n[Shri Mataji shows to the children to touch their Sahastrara, probably after washing the Feet]\n\nPujari: Now the mantras of the Goddess.\n\nNamo Devyai Mahaa-Devyai Shivaayai Satatam Namah Namah Prakrtyai Bhadraayai Niyataah Prannataah Sma Taam (mantra continues).\n\nMataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha Avahanam Samarpayami. \n\nShri Mataji: Now the Avahana. After awakening yourself, awakening all your channels, now the Avahana is the calling, now you are inviting your Mother. This is the nimantranam, this is the way you are inviting.\n\n[Shri Mataji calls one child to wash Her Feet] [Hindi].\n\nPujari: (continues with mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha Asanathe Akshatam Samarpayami. \n\n(Continues with mantras)\n\nMataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha Padyam Samarpayami. \n\nPadyam is the washing of the Feet of the Divine Mother. (Continues with mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha Arghyam Samarpayami. \n\nShri Mataji: Now it is very interesting, in Sanskrit language, when you are using the water to wash the Feet of the Goddess, then it\xe2\x80\x99s called as Padyam. When you are giving water for Mother to drink, it\xe2\x80\x99s Arghyam. The word changes, you see. Once it is for the Goddess, or for Gods, then the word is different. For other people it is just water \xe2\x80\x93 they call it nira, jalam, anything. But for the Goddess it is padyam. Arghyam. Asanam.\n\nPujari: Udaka also.\n\nShri Mataji: Eh?\n\nPujari: Udaka.\n\nShri Mataji: Udaka, Udaka also. Pouring the water \xe2\x80\x93 the water that is poured is called as Udak. (Shri Mataji laughs) No other language has this.\n\nPujari: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: No language \xe2\x80\x93 only except in English I think they call God \xe2\x80\x9cThou\xe2\x80\x9d, perhaps, maybe.\n\nPujari: That is the limit.\n\nShri Mataji: Eh?\n\nPujari: That is the limit.\n\nShri Mataji: That\xe2\x80\x99s the limit (laughter).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more! For God if we call Thou You should be satisfied!\xe2\x80\x9d. (Laughter)\n\nYes, good.\n\n[Pujari continues with mantras. Then: Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha Acchamanayam Samarpayami.]\n\nShri Mataji: Acchamanayam: whatever used, for\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nPujari: Sipping.\n\nShri Mataji: Sipping, you see. Acchaman is sipping. Of the Mother, is called as Acchamani.\n\n[Pujari recites names of Indian rivers in Sanskrit]\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nShri Mataji: All these rivers I bring to Your Feet to give You bath.\n\nPujari: Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha Snamayam Samarpayami.\n\nGavin: See, we are near the sources of two great rivers of this country here.\n\nShri Mataji: What is that?\n\nGavin: The Thames and Severn both start very close to here.\n\nShri Mataji: Here? It\xe2\x80\x99s Thames and\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\nGavin: Severn.\n\nYogi: Severn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start here.\n\nGavin, No, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a tributary for it just\xe2\x80\xa6 Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Is it? Thames starts from here?\n\nYogi: But the most (?) famous of all the springs that come out of the earth is Cheltenham, Mother.\n\nYogis: Spa. (Laughter)\n\nShri Mataji: Spa: ah!\n\nPujari: Now we offer ghee to Shri Mataji.\n\nShould we take another for You?\n\nShri Mataji: Ghee is to be offered.\n\nYou see, if you want to use the Feet water this time then do it, it\xe2\x80\x99s good, all right, start. Better do it, it\xe2\x80\x99s good.\n\nPujari: (recites Sanskrit mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah Ghruta snanam samarpayami. Shuddhodaka snanam samarpayami. \n\nNextly come milk.\n\nShri Mataji: Shuddhodaka, now water has to be poured out.\n\nPujari: Pure \xe2\x80\x93 not just \xe2\x80\x93 pure water.\n\nShri Mataji: But Shuddhodaka - is all right, pure water. Shuddhodaka - not even water it is, it is the water that is to be pured - poured, is Shuddhodaka; and Shuddha is the pure.\n\nPujari: (Mantras). Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah paya snanam samarpayami. Shuddhodaka snanam samarpayami. \n\nNext we offer curd to Shri Mataji.\n\nShri Mataji: Little hot \xe2\x80\x93 more hot water.\n\nPujari: (Mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah dadhi snanam samarpayami.

Shuddhodaka snanam samarpayami. \n\nShri Mataji: Milk has to be more. More milk. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, you can pour more milk now.\n\nIn out of proportion it is. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep heated milk, it is better, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It should all go away when you put the sugar.\n\nPujari: Next we offer sugar to Shri Mataji. Has been pured from the sugarcane.\n\n(Sanskrit mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah sharkara snanam samarpayami. Shuddhodaka snanam samarpayami. \n\nShri Mataji: Now rub it on My Feet (the sugar \xe2\x80\x93 ed.). Would be better. Then the fingers you see, just - it\xe2\x80\x99s still there, quite a lot. The chakras are.\n\n(Somebody aside: \xe2\x80\x9cShiny!\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nPujari: Next we offer to Shri Mataji three auspicious things mixed in water: camphor, sandalwood paste and perfume.\n\n(Sanskrit mantras follow)\n\nShri Mataji: Now on the Feet. Just pour it. Now pour the water. Too much. Yes, there. (Indistinct).\n\nPujari: Now we are supposed to offer Shri Mataji sindhur, tulasi leaves and turmeric powder.\n\nShri Mataji: Tulsi, tulsi leaves, first. That\xe2\x80\x99s all, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll remove My Feet. Offer tulsi leaves. Have you got tulasi here?\n\nBasil. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get it later. All right?\n\nGood. (Sanskrit mantras for offering of tulsi)\n\nNow just wipe My Feet, take this out and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put them on the ground, now you can put\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nPujari: (Sanskrit mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah bhupam samarpayami.\n\nShri Mataji: Now spread something here down below, put here something else, dry this. Yes. Just the sindhur and this thing, these things you put on My Feet. And must \xe2\x80\x93 you must put keshar, keshar you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got. I should have brought keshar. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try, saffron.\n\nPujari: Because here in this country we can get it.\n\nShri Mataji: Saffron you get quite a lot.\n\nPujari: It\xe2\x80\x99s quite easy.\n\nShri Mataji: Very easy. Saffron is very good. Now.\n\nPujari: We should take some photographs.\n\nShri Mataji: Hm?\n\nPujari: We should take some photographs.\n\nShri Mataji: Yes.

Just akshata, mix it up in that, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Just this, you see.\n\nLittle bit, yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.

All right.\n\nPujari: Now to the five forms of Pranayami.\n\nShri Mataji (to Gavin): Now the karpura (camphor) little bit. Rub it up.\n\nNow the offering whatever I have to eat \xe2\x80\x93 something you have\xe2\x80\xa6(indistinct words) sweet or chana will do. Chana, chana is absolutely best, I love chana.\n\nThis is Naivedhyam, you see, just (indistinct). Only the Brahmins eat everything (laughter), the Gods don\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\n\nPujari: Om Shri Pranaya swaha. \n\nShri Mataji: Chana (Shri Mataji vibrates the food). \n\nPujari: Om Shri Apanaya Swaha. Om Shri Bhyanaya Swaha. Om Shri Uddhanaya swaha. Om Shri Samanaya swaha.

(Laughter)\n\nPujari: (Mantra) Now we can - sari, Mataji, vastraya.\n\nShri Mataji: Vastra. [Pujari aside to somebody: \xe2\x80\x9cYou got some sari?\xe2\x80\x9d] Sari\xe2\x80\xa6(hindi). What sari? What\xe2\x80\x99s that? No, no, no. Sari\xe2\x80\x99s out of question.\n\nPujari: Which vastran, then?\n\nShri Mataji: Which one they opened within now - anything. No, now - any vastran you can use that \xe2\x80\x93 do...\n\n[Yogi softly: \xe2\x80\x9cWe could try\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\n(Shri Mataji says to a baby girl talking) Olympia\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n(Shri Mataji makes the gesture not to talk) Good.\n\nPujari: (Recitation of mantras) Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah Vastran Samarpayami.\n\nAum - Sandal.

Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi)\n\nPujari: Shall we do the Sahasranama (\xe2\x80\xa6) - Lalita Sahasranama?\n\nShri Mataji: [Hindi conversation with pujari. \xe2\x80\x9cPuja\xe2\x80\xa6 Havan\xe2\x80\xa6 Havana\xe2\x80\xa6 Devi Mahatmya\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d. Pujari: \xe2\x80\x9cDevi Mahatmyam\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\nNo, the - when Mahishasura was killed, you see, this one was read. So the beginning of it - and then say it, read it in English, would be better. [Pujari starts reading in Sanskrit] If you read it in English (Shri Mataji laughs) would be better.\n\nPujari: Read it in English.\n\nShri Mataji: Hm, then whatever is in English is the story. It\xe2\x80\x99s better that they understand. (Hindi) All right, stand up and read it.\n\nPujari: This is the great hymn to the Goddess when She had killed Mahishasura, whom as we all know is back again in Bangalore.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo that Ambika who is worthy of worship by all the devas and sages, and who pervades this world by Her power, and who is the embodiment of the entire power of all the hosts of Devas, we bow in devotion.\n\nMay She grant us auspicious things.\n\nMay Chandika whose incomparable greatness and power, Bhagavan Vishnu, Brahma and Hara are unable to describe, bestow Her mind on protecting the entire world, and on destroying the fear of evil.\n\nOh Devi, we bow before You. Who are Yourself good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous, and ill-fortune in those of the vicious, intelligence in the hearts of the learned, faith in the hearts of the good, and modesty in the hearts of the high-born. May You protect the Universe!\n\nOh Devi, how can we describe Your inconceivable form, or Your abundant, surpassing valour that destroys the Asuras, or Your wonderful feats displayed in battles amongst all the hosts of Gods, asuras and others?\n\nYou are the origin of all the three worlds, though You are possessed of the three gunas, You are not known to have any of their attendant qualities. You are incomprehensible even to Vishnu, Shiva and others. You are the resort of all. The entire world is composed of an infinitesimal portion of Yourself. You are verily the Supreme Primordial Prakruti. Untransformed.\n\nOh Devi, You are swaha, at whose utterance the whole assemblage of Gods obtain satisfaction in all the sacrifices. You are the swadha\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShri Mataji: Same. Now, these are the mantras of the swaha: Bhuh is pruthvi, is Ganesha Tattwa. Then you said swah.\n\nPujari: Yes. Om Bhuh Bhuvah Swah.\n\nShri Mataji: Swah is the satisfaction.\n\nBhuvah is the Antariksha, the whole universe.\n\nPujari: You are the swadha which gives satisfaction to the manes\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nShri Mataji: Swa-dha: swa is your self, dha means you have sustained yourself with your self. Swadha is the quality of the Nabhi chakra.\n\nPujari: \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore you are chanted by people. Oh Devi, You are Bhagavati, the Supreme Vidya, which is the cause of liberation and great inconceivable penances.\n\nYou are the Supreme Knowledge, are cultivated by sages who desire liberation, whose senses are well restrained and who are devoted to reality and have shed all the blemishes. (Shri Mataji indicates with Her finger to pay particular attention to this). \n\nYou are the soul of Shabda-Brahma, You are the repository of the very pure\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShri Mataji: Logos, logos you call? - Shabda-Brahma. OM. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the Soul of that\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nPujari: OM. All the Vedas come out of it (unclear).\n\nShri Mataji: Everything is created out of that OM. Shabda-Brahma is OM, and out of that all this Brahma \xe2\x80\x93 means Brahmanda - is created, out of OM.\n\nPujari: Shabda-Brahma.\n\nShri Mataji: All the scriptures.\n\nPujari: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the repository of the very pure Rik and Yajus hymns and of the Sama hymns, the recital of those words is beautiful with the Udgitha. You are Bhagavati, embodying the three Vedas. And You are the sustenance whereby life is maintained.\n\nYou are the Supreme Destroyer of the pain of all the worlds. Oh Devi, You are the intellect, by which the essence of all scriptures is comprehended. You are Durga, the boat that takes men across the difficult ocean of worldly existence, devoid of attachments. You are Shri who has invariably taken Her abode in the heart of Vishnu.\n\nYou are indeed Gauri who has established Herself with Shiva. Gently smiling, pure, resembling the full moon\xe2\x80\x99s orb, beautiful like the splendor of excellent gold was Your face. Yet it was very strange that, being swayed by anger, Mahishasura could not bear it.\n\nFar strange it is that after seeing Your wrathful face, O Devi, terrible with its frowns and red in hue like the rising moon, that Mahishasura did not immediately give up his life! For, who can live after beholding the enraged Destroyer?\n\nO Devi, be propitious. You are Supreme. If enraged, you forthwith destroy the (asura) families for the welfare of the world. This was known the very moment the extensive forces of Mahishasura were brought to their end.\n\nYou are always bounteous, to those fortunate ones with whom You are well pleased, are indeed the object of esteem in the country, theirs are riches, theirs are glories, and their acts of righteousness perish not; they are indeed blessed and possessed of devoted children, servants and wives.\n\nBy Your Grace, O Devi, the blessed individual does daily all righteous deeds with utmost care and thereby attains to heaven. Are You not, therefore, O Devi, the bestower of reward in all the three worlds?\n\nWhen called to mind in a difficult position, You remove fear from every person. When called to mind by those in happiness, You bestow a mind still more pious. Which Goddess but You, O Dispeller of poverty, pain and fear, has an ever sympathetic heart for helping everybody?\n\nThe world attains happiness by the killing of these foes; and though these asuras have committed sins enough to keep them long in hell, let them reach heaven by meeting death eventually at battle with You. Thinking thus, it is that You, O Devi, certainly destroy our enemies.\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t You reduce to ashes all asuras by mere sight? But You direct Your weapons against them so that even the wicked ones, purified by the missiles, may attain higher worlds\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nShri Mataji: Yes. (She points Her index finger to draw the attention on this point)\n\nPujari: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is Your most kindly intention towards them\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nShri Mataji: This one you read again.\n\nPujari: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t You reduce to ashes all asuras by mere sight? But You direct Your weapons against them so that even the wicked ones, purified by the missiles, may attain the higher worlds\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nShri Mataji: May attain. May.\n\nPujari: May. (Laughter) \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Your most kindly intention towards them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShri Mataji: Not promised. (Laughter)\n\nPujari: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the eyes of the asuras had not been blinded by the terrible flashes of the mass of light issuing from Your sword or by the copious luster of Your spear point, it is because they saw also Your face resembling the moon, giving out cool rays.\n\nO Devi, Your nature is to subdue the conduct of the wicked; this is Your peerless beauty inconceivable by others; Your power destroys those who have robbed the Devas of their prowess, and You have thus manifested Your compassion even towards the enemies.\n\nWhat is Your prowess to be compared to? Where can one find this beauty (of Yours) most charming, yet striking fear in enemies?\n\nCompassion in heart and relentlessness in battle are seen, O Devi, O Bestower of boons, only in You in all the three worlds!\n\nThrough the destruction of the enemies all the three worlds have been saved by You. Having killed them in the battlefront, You have led even those hosts of enemies upwards, and You have dispelled our fear of the frenzied enemies of the Devas. Salutations to You.\n\nOh Devi, protect us with Your spear.
