It is the country of yoga, the great country of spirituality have been bleeding and pulsating in every walk of life, in art, in music, in dance, in every mundane steps that people choose in spiritual existence. It is so great to see that we have still maintained the great conditions of the great art in this great country.

Iâ€™m very thankful to them on behalf of all the western Sahaja yogis that they have been so kind to give you a vision of this great country which one day will show to the world as that supreme thing within inside which is going to govern every human heart and going give them that joy, that Shiva, Sadashiva as promised.
