Public Program, Paris (France), September the 9th, 1981

[Starts here]: Marie: ... Que vous devenez, que vous devez devenir l'Esprit. [...That you become, that you must become the Spirit.]Shri Mataji: Once that happens all these great people will be born here. People always are worried about Indian population. Where should they [the saints] be born? In this England? Where every week two children are killed by their parents, heartless? The poor Indians have to bear the load.

The Last Judgment has now started. They are all to be born. There will be a flux of these Realized souls and also the devils to fight. Where should the devils take their place? Among the people who are not divine. If you don't become divine the devils will be born of you. It is a very dangerous thing.
So, there is a big gap [inaudible] between the divine and the devil.
But now, whatever work I've done in England, I'm quite happy and I think it has started taking its roots. In Paris, I hope things will work out. The Grace of God has to work it out.
All of you who are here should know their responsibility. I give you all this information, you'd better use it. Then you will not blame Me that I did not tell you.
Thank you very much.
May God bless you.
[Applause]

Shri Mataji: If there are any questions, you can ask Me.

Seeker: Oui, je voudrais savoir ce que pense Mataji de la grande catastrophe de 1983? Marie: What do you think of the great catastrophe of 1983? Shri Mataji: Nothing. You have to get out of it. [Laughter] Seeker: Parce qu'elle est annoncée dans les prédictions, elle est annoncée également par les astronomes, elle est prévue par les- elle est vraiment, disons, attendue.Marie: It has been predicted by all sorts of people.Shri Mataji: They just want to frighten you. But it has an advantage so that you become alert.But it can be the opposite. Like, this is going to fall down, all right? And if you bring the force from that side you can take it. We have to build this force. But if people do not take to reality they have to face it.How many are there from Paris to see I 'm here?On the road, we couldn't drive our car, so many on the road running their rat race! They have no time for God. So the Devi had to come, if not in India, in Paris. What can we do? It is for you people to choose.

Seeker: Oui, mais il y a quand même une concentration planétaire, justement, qui va se manifester courant 83, qui n'a jamais, n'est jamais arrivée en France une seule fois. Il y a eu une expérience, il y a eu un phénomène une fois semblable au moment de la peste noire au cours du Moyen-age.... Alors je voudrais savoir si on peut échapper justement à ça? Shri Mataji: I mean, it's going to be meant like this. Don't get human lights.Marie: Tout cela, c'est de l'activité mentale.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no. See, you must get your Realization. You must get your Realization. What happens, I’ll tell you, don’t get too much into mental like this, this chakra goes into the head, all right? To a point, it’s all right, to a point. Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy. Now, what is more important? Because I want you to get your Realization, all right? I want you to get your Realization. That’s the main thing.I’ve seen people who go on asking questions they [inaudible] to Me. So, better get your Realization, that’s the main point. Now, what did he mean?Marie: He said there’s going to be a configuration of planets.Shri Mataji: It’s true.But do you know about Pluto? About the planet which has come, Pluto? That came with Me on this earth. [inaudible] That’s why you are waiting. If they talk of philosophy they should also talk of Pluto. They just talk of one side.

 [French chat about the subject]

Shri Mataji: Sahaja Yogis should not ask questions.[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: What did he say? Marie: He said that if you get Realization you can die from it, it's not important.Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no! Then you become the tree. The seed dies and you become the tree. You have to grow, all right?He understands. He's a seeker. You'd better get it.

Seeker lady: Est-ce que Mataji est née scorpion?Marie: She wants to know if you are born as Scorpio.Shri Mataji: No, no. I was born on the 21 of March at twelve o'clock in the daytime, in 1923. Just do the horoscope and you will know. It's another way of knowing. I was born in Chindwara in the center of India. On the tropic of cancer. [The French lady notes down the info.]

Shri Mataji: My horoscope has been published in one of the magazines, all right? But still, I'm very elusive. You'd better get the Realization. [Inaudible] Shri Mataji: What did she say? Marie: She said that she heard the music of "sphere" when she was eight years old. Shri Mataji: What did she say? Marie: The music of "sphere". Shri Mataji: It's better to hear the music of your Spirit. All right? Then you are not a medium but you become the master. Then you control everything. [The lady says that she knows already and she is 75 years old.] Shri Mataji: You'd better get your Realization.

Seeker: Je voudrais savoir le point de départ de la méditation.Shri Mataji: What did he say?Marie: He wants to know the point of start of Realization [meditation].Seeker: Comment pratique-t-on la méditation Sahaja Yoga?Marie: How do you practice Sahaja Yoga meditation?Shri Mataji: The start is when the Kundalini rises. When you put your hands towards Me like this, your fingers have those centers of the left and the right. You take out your shoes. Let them, let them do it later one. Later on, you can do it later not now. Take off your shoes is better because the Mother Earth helps you a lot. Mother Earth. Put your shoes at the back. Shri Mataji [to a Sahaja Yogi]: Open the door to get some space. Put the shoes at the back. Now, put your hands towards Me like this. Just like this.

And these fingers are seven centers, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven centers. One on the left, one on the right.
Now, when you get- the Kundalini receives the information through this channel, through this first centre of innocence. Now, when it is received here, the information, then she starts awakening herself. She's made of many strings of powers, like a rope. Then she starts throwing her strings to the channels here, the channel here [central] through different centers, awakening them, widening them, improving them. Supposing there is an obstruction, then you see the thing pulsating here [sacrum], very strongly in some people who have this. Especially in possessed people.
Now, the obstruction here, if removed, then the Kundalini rises or some people don't have any obstruction, then she shoots up.
But if supposing, the obstruction here is due to liver troubles you can see the Kundalini going and looking after it. But if there is sufficient space made then, little, little space made, then she rises in any case.

She awakens Christ over here and sucks these two in, ego and superego and then creates a space here. And she just goes up. First, it is like this [closed]. Then it is sucked in and a space is made.
And that's how you get your real Baptism.

You can feel the throbbing here first. When the Kundalini goes above this you become thoughtless, there is no thought in your mind. When she crosses over you start getting cool breeze in the hand, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, not hot. If there is hot [heat] or there is shaking that means there is a little friction. You have to just throw it away. Now you should see. Some people get it in the right, some in the left, depending on their imbalances. But any Realized soul who is a Sahaja Yogi knows all about it, can give you a balance, can raise your Kundalini, can give you Realization. The same way it will happen to you. Like one enlightened light can enlighten another light. But the light which is not enlightened cannot enlighten another light. You don't do know anything, the candle is ready, just you are enlightened that's how you enlighten another light. It works like that.

After some time, we can use the media like a radio, television, the sound and light energy, to pass this energy and can achieve more masse Realization. That's how the science has given us all these.

We did that in Australia [She Mataji was on TV] and many people got Realization. Now, there are centres in seven cities of Australia. Paris, I've been coming for how many years? Marie: One and a half. Shri Mataji: No, no, I came last- how many times I came here? Marie: You came four times in one year and a half. Shri Mataji: Four times. And I've been only once to Australia. And we are at least, they are one hundred times more people. 

Australians are supposed to be the people who are punished for doing something wrong, supposed to be. I mean, they are great-grandchildren but they are very wise, very sensible. That's what it is.

We don't know how to judge people. But it's going to be work out.

But then we have a center here, where you should go and study, how truth is truth [unsure] Thanks God we have a centre here where they should learn how to improve themselves. They give all Realization in the centre. But you must have an innate desire to grow. You don't have to pay anything, only thing you have to attend to the need of your Spirit. When you get the cool breeze in the hands, a rapport is established to the Divine. You can ask any absolute question. Like, you can ask any absurd question: “Is there God?” And you will get a big flow of that thing. To ask about any guru if he is true, you can find out. Most of these who have come to the West are all thieves [unsure].

There are parasites they want to live on your money. They will go to Hell and they will bring all their disciples with them. So don't be identified with them.

You have to be honest. If you are dishonest with yourself, God cannot help you. If you thinks no end of yourself God says: “All right! Go ahead!” You have to be open and cheerful. Because God is anxious to save his creation. All right?

May God bless you.

Shri Mataji: One more, you were asking a question?

Seeker: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Same question. You are seekers. This is the beautiful children I have seen. These are the seekers. I have come on this earth for these. It gives Me a great, immense pleasure to meet them. I've been speaking so much and traveling. Did they understand the program?

Marie: I don't know.

Shri Mataji: Can you open the door?

No put your hand towards Me like this.

[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: I think I'll be able to say, carry about it. Why should we have Self-realization? It's a very good subject. Before asking such a question, we have to understand what are we. What is a human being and what are his problems and what he can become.

Now, this is a human being here as you see drawn by Ruth.

Sahaja Yogi: Warren.

Shri Mataji: All right by Warren. You must tell every body.

Well, you have many exterior forms, inside you are just the same.

[aside] If you can move that side so that they all can see, all right? Can you? That side.

Can you see all?

Now, this human being has got his right side, his left side and from [inaudible] and the four dimension there [at Sahasrara].

Now, this side is his past. When he goes beyond it, then it is subconscious that becomes the Collective Subconscious. Now, by this side he goes towards the future. This is the present. Below is the matter, the material thing [under the Mooladhara].

By entering into this realm he becomes collectively supraconscious. Now, a human being has the freedom to enter in any one of these areas. If you indulge into too much then you move onto left side. This is the side of your psyche, your emotions. Those who say we “suffer, we are unhappy” and enjoy their suffering, they go on to the left side. They like to enjoy that movement of their attention.

Now, those who move to the right side are ambitious beings. These assert the physical and the mental efforts to activate or to act upon the desire.

Now, these, both the sides are easy to go at a human level. Either we live in the future or in the past but not in the present.

Now, below the human being is the material side from where animals and all that kingdom is coming. Now he has also the freedom to become the animal-like. His heart can also become like a stone. All these possibilities are there with this human awareness that you have already.
