Talk to Yogis after TV Programme, Brasil, 1992-10-15 

Shri Mataji: The very basic [UNCLEAR] all is here.

Yogi: I think you went [UNCLEAR somewhere so long too].

Shri Mataji: It means that. Have you seen the racist? [UNCLEAR Adam].

Yogi: I've heard of the same.

Shri Mataji: The racist. He delivered Me, with Me. And then there was the minister. [UNCLEAR] the minister.

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He was...

Yogi: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: So, in any case... we have told about that.

Yogi: [UNCLEAR] have cooked Shri Mataji. [UNCLEAR]

Yogi: He would care Shri Mataji for some people to come to the program.

Shri Mataji: So that's all.

Yogi: That's the good point about it, because thousands of, millions [UNCLEAR]...

Another Yogi: Thank God I did not have my machine gun, Shri Mataji. I should have taken it from Switzerland.

Yogini: He wished he had.

Yogi: Machine gun. He was going to destroy [UNCLEAR everyone].

Another Yogi: I was very close too! Shri Mataji, I ask for forgiveness for all the media, because they are stupid people.

Shri Mataji: There's no problem with that. They think they are great. But the Muslim people is... How would they write to the Christian?

Yogi: But you see, I mean, your face came very beautifully on the television.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: No, this, it was very short, but it was really tremendous. It was because Shri Mataji, Nirmala Devi, Sahaja yoga. And then you could see your face, and it was very beautiful.

Yogi: It was so different, what program stopped at this point.

Shri Mataji: Never upset, you see. Because she came practically [UNCLEAR]... There was a minister. Oh, if the minister is there, how will he allow anybody else to speak? Then after Me also she was happy to be here. She just asked me how to stay here. She's so ignorant.

Yogi: How about we felt sorry, because you had to wait so much.

Shri Mataji: You know, it's very far away. You have to go to a [UNCLEAR] and this, that... [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR].

There was one lady [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] yes. You don't have to ask me questions to her. Okay? She is so not explaining what she is saying to Me. Because, question was from your materialist, why have you come. No?

Yogi: We heard this, a bit.

Yogi: We heard this, Shri Mataji, but it was very short the change in her feelings, believe me.

Shri Mataji: I should have not [UNCLEAR], if she was going there. But... Not [UNCLEAR really that]. See what she means to say, I don't know. That I need to come out, please, when she does know how to... how to manage to come out. Something like that, but I more worried about [UNCLEAR] than I was about.

Yogi: He was angry, I think. Thank God I didn't approach him.

Shri Mataji: But that's why I don't like to do [UNCLEAR] things. You should take her and speak like this and [UNCLEAR]. They are of a very low level. You should have heard that you can't assume the [UNCLEAR]. They take it at personal. You see, this type of people. You see, they have no level up or they are very rude.

Yogi: Actually we should have gone ourselves, Shri Mataji, without you, that would have been the best idea.

Shri Mataji: See, I was having a wrong impression. I thought that we want to know people. But I thought the wrong impression. But you were telling me [UNCLEAR]...with or without.

Yogi: I beg your pardon, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And you were telling me this that you did not go.

Yogi: No, because...

Shri Mataji: But I thought he wants you to go as well. It's a good experience. Now maybe people will understand why I am telling you that and that. You don't need them. See, ours to straight forward. And they are for sensational things and cheap things. How can you go through them? I suppose you can understand. You have spent that day before you did first, right?

CUT

Shri Mataji: She might be exposed, no doubt. But she, she is gone. I think she was obvious by the minister. But he was already on the agenda. This lady, who is the first lady in that country? She was talking for such a long time. I don't know what she has said.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, today you were talking about longing. You were talking about longing today and talking about how bad it is. She was saying just praise in London. London? She was praising it and I felt you know it was so strange.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: Sorry Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR].

Yogini: She prefers to live there. She was praising it for 10 minutes, I don't know. Only praising London. And I don't know what to say.

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] develop.

Yogini: She is a correspondent for Brazilian newspapers. She writes from abroad to Brazilian newspapers. But she was so silly and the way she spoke for a woman of her age was too much to hear.

Shri Mataji: You first put the minister. Maria and I was told that they are going to focus on Mother. So please bring her. First [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: That's it. You see, that's the mischiefs of the media. I mean the big lesson for me Shri Mataji is that when this world will be about to be completely ruined they will come and beg to have an interview from us, from you and before that we should not have any touch with them because even if, you see.

Shri Mataji: I have told one thing that I will never told. They come here and do it, all right. So far I have never been understood.

Yogi: But the good part of it Shri Mataji that I mean millions of Brazilians have seen you and you have been able to give your message and I mean no doubt. So...

Shri Mataji: Actually I made it short also in a way.

Yogi: Yes, you made it short.

Shri Mataji: I said that I will do this when you come to My room.

Yogi: That's very clear.

Another Yogi: No, but you see I mean it's a contrast between you I mean it's not to be described but I mean this is the good part of it. If I have to say that you should all the time see a good part of it but it might upset me that you have to wait so much.

Shri Mataji: Why did he go and sit in the middle? So angry.

Yogi: We could have shared our things together.

Shri Mataji: The reason she came and then she went for her tea in the table plate, you see. But she went for her tea. All the Sahaja Yogis! Mother is sitting there, she's gone for tea what is she [UNCLEAR]. Then Raja didn't pay her. She said, nonsense you didn't respect my room. She was telephoning to me all the time. He paid her whatever it was she paid before. Then they came and man who was with her came and he said you have to also pay for the arguing person and all. She said, I'm sorry I paid for that room. What was the chef who came and he said I think friend of herself. She said, my room you should not say like that about her. She said, I said what about my room? But she's just a music group. What is so great about my room? The way she behaved. Actually I had cured her. She could not sing so I cured her. You meet all kinds of people.

Now on one side we have the president of the [UNCLEAR]. You see it, okay. [UNCLEAR I'll just sit here. You sit here.] On the other side [UNCLEAR]... good job...

CUT

Yogini: She's cooking.

Shri Mataji: She was crying all the way.

Yogi: Why?

Shri Mataji: What is hard to say was she's done so much now. Such a nice apartment, such nice flowers.

Yogi: But this is sometimes water powers you need [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: I said, either you give up or you cry.

Yogini: That's the problem.

Shri Mataji: I [UNCLEAR when get that]. That's the problem.

Yogini: You could only cry. It was so angry.

Yogi: Either you give in or you cry.

Shri Mataji: Sit down.

CUT

Yogi: He's the rakhi brother now. He has to be cautious, Shri Mataji. He's the rakhi brother of my wife. So have to be cautious.

Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Yogi: Or I receive a smack now.

Yogini: Actually I have two rakhi brothers here. Because Horacio is also here.

Shri Mataji: Horacio is also.

Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Yogini: Long time back.

Shri Mataji: So now, be careful. I can open the window.
