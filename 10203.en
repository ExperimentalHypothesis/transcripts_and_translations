Havan after Adi Shakti Puja 1982-08-01

Shri Mataji: Now, let’s understand the significance, all right? Now, he said a word ‘Swaha’. ‘Swaha’ is the capacity of the Nabhi Chakra. That is - it burns everything. The capacity! You can say ‘the essence’. It burns up everything. Whatever you put of the fire, it burns up. That’s one. Second it purifies. Say, if you have got mixed up gold and you put it in the fire, it glances. It burn something, it does not burn something - discriminate. It has got discrimination. It has got brilliance. Fire has another great capacity, that it goes against the gravity. And when it goes against the gravity, it suggests that there can be another energy that can go against the gravity and that is the Kundalini. Many people confused with Kundalini the Prana Shakti. They thought, because Prana Shakti is the child of fire. They could only related to Kundalini. They thought that Kundalini and Prana Shakti are the same, because Kundalini also goes against the gravity. Then it has capacity to give you brilliance. A person who do this fire can use it to polishing things into brilliant, to its brilliance. It has capacity to join by melt it. Like human beings are like steel, worse than that sometimes. Then it’s this part in a subtle way for heart, melts their heart and joins them. 
So the significance of fire is expressed here, and that’s why fire is worshipped. Fire has been worshipped since very, very long time by many gurus, prophets - they worshipped fire. And the essence of it was that we should have the quality of fire. Now, when the saints like you invoke the fire, you invoke the essence of fire. Essence of fire is ‘Swaha’. And this essence of fire gives you all the subtle qualities of the fire. First of all, it burns away your negativity. You have seen that on the photograph when you have a candle and if there are negative forces it flickers, it dances. Because of you and My photograph the fire of the candle has been enlightened. Sort of it has reach this ‘Swaha’ stage. Where it is Swaha it assumes it’s Swaha stage. And when it assumes its ‘Swaha’ stage then it burns. Now many, no fire can burn, you know that, but you have seen it, it happened. 
When the fire in the stomach, that is within us, when it is enlightened, then it enlightens our attention. We get the capacity to rise against gravity that is Mana [ambiguous]. Then we understand the discrimination that the fire does that it burns certain things and it not burns certain things. When we have that capacity we also discriminate, we know. It also has got digest, it has got light, it gives you a face which is brilliant, which is shining, and also gives your eyes the capacity to see right things and right places. Eyes become brilliant and when in the eyes this fire is enlightened, there is a glint in your eyes. Sahaja Yogis have a glint in their eyes, a shining, like a [...], like you can say a flame. And you can go on adding to it and can go on working.
The food is digested by this fire within us. But when an enlightened person digest it, then whatever is produced out of that fire becomes [...], means it becomes [...]. When you vibrate the food and eat it, it goes in the stomach and makes the fire of the stomach that ‘Swaha Shakti’, that Swaha power. And then this power makes the food act like a medicine. That’s why we put vibrations in what we eat, because once it goes in the stomach, it will excite that Swaha power in you. Like this, all the powers of the fire, which are good powers, whatever are auspicious are good powers, the good side of it, they get enlightened and [...]. 
That’s why Havana is. So this is the Nabhi chakra and we putting everything to the universal Nabhi. It uses this discretion, burns off all this which is bad, then it clears the atmosphere by throwing it’s flames around, by charging the atmosphere with its capacity – or say the atmosphere ether – is Akasha. It also has got its subtle being. It excites the Akasha, the Akasha also gets cleared out. Most things cleared out, all the Bhoots and Badhas and Pisachhas run away, all negativity runs away. All lethargic inertia goes out. It excites also the [...] that is there, the vegetation, [...], animals. Every sort of thing that exists, whatever has created. Whatever has created has been enlightened by this fire. But of course it depends of your capacity also to excite the fire. How much you can excite that fire is very much important. 
Supposing you are an impure personality and you are not yet there, your link with the divine is poor, you are a doubting Tomas, some of them are inauspicious, all nonsense there are. They can’t do this. Only a person, who is a realized soul and who has given realization to many people works it out better. So, all those who are sitting here must remember that the responsibility is very great. Just now, put all you nonsensical doubts on one side and please work it out. Otherwise if you cannot do it, you better give up, because it’s like a dog in the manger, as I told you. You can’t do it, you don’t won’t others to do it. It’s no problem. At least let others do it, because we want atmosphere to clear out. We want everybody should be helped, we want Sahaja Yoga to be established, we want the emancipation of human being, we want peace descend, we want blessings of God to come. Those who don’t want to do it or think that they are doubtful, they should not do it. Absolutely [...]. Because they don’t realize just now. They will doing when they realize. It’s a very open offer to all of you not to feel insulted or bad, but to do it with your heart. If you cannot do it, you should not do it, because this is a very great tusk we have taken over, it’s a tremendous tusk. Is not just having some people around you and having [...], it’s a very deep tusk and those who are capable of doing it, should only do it otherwise they spoil it again (ambiguous).
First of all, we always worship Shri Ganesha, who came as our Lord Jesus Christ on this earth. Because He is the Vignanasha, He is the one who takes out all the [...] that can come on this deep [...]. All right?
Nobody has the authority to do a Havana [...] the Brahmins, they can’t do it. One develop a problem. [...]
All right! So now this is the beginning (16:00)
Do it very carefully. You have to put it round because you are realized souls, you have your own powers. When you put it round, what you do, you give a Bandhan yourself, and whatever is there within you, goes into it and you put it. So the fire discriminately does everything. It solves all the problems at one time. It burn out whatever is bad, it give you whatever is good. It will establish the gold in you, it give you the lustre, everything works out simultaneously. But you have to awaken the subtleness, for that you have to be sublte yourself. If you are gross and if you are mundane, and if you are on that level, then rather difficult. You can understand that. You have to have the level. 
Start of the Havan with mantras (17:00).
They have a ‚master of ceremonies‘, which leads the Havan. Shri Mataji sometimes interrupt and instruct him.
Shri Ganesha Mantra (1x); 

Shri Mataji:” Now, you have to say ‘Agni Devta’, because ‘Agni Devta’ is the one, which is ‘Swaha’ and you have to say [...]” 

Sahastrara Mantras 

Shri Agni Devata Mantra 

The ‚master of ceremonies‘: “Now, take the names of the seven flames of –“

Shri Mataji interrupt: “See, Agni as I told you is the seeking, all right? Is the water. Now, today you are going to do Devi’s names, means that is the desire. The most powerful thing is Devi’s names. What you are doing, is to now, trying to purify your desires - the basics, absolutely, where you have to return of. So, that’s what you have trying to do. Supposing we want to have more action, then you should do [...], Saraswatis names. Now if you want to have more evolution – Vishnu. We are quite evolved, but they’re find a gap to between the others, so let us create more desires, all right? Because if we only evolve, only we few will left in the air, the rest will be all belong. Take the Vedas, look where they are (people laughing). They have to work it out, there are all blind people. They don’t understand. We have to go slow and to make it slow and to make them – mhh – come of, this is the Puja we are doing to desire. Mahakali Puja to desire, is the Devis Puja, the primordial mother, so Adi Shaktis Pujas is there, that so the desire is created.

Mantra (the seven tongues of flame): Saptajihvah, Kali, Karali, Manojava, Sulohita, Sudhumravarna, ugra cha sphulingini netra dipteshvari namah. Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti..., ; (Anm.: Saptajihvah = the Lord in His manifestation as Fire is conceived as having seven tongues of flame).

Mantra: Om Shri Agni Devta, Agni Shakti, Agni Mata Namaha. Om Swaha.

Shri Mataji: “See, it doesn’t burn. It’s a living thing. It doesn’t burn - (break). All what you have in your hands, all the fragrant things come from various sources, meant to be put the fragrance of the mother earth, and put fragrance for this fire. So, it burns away all that is nonsensical and keeps to fragrance and makes the whole atmosphere fragrant. Fragrance is the essence of mother earth. The ‘Bhoo’ – that is called as the ‘Bhoo’ - but is the fragrance. So, first we are going to say a few names of Shiva. 

Name of Shri Shiva - Swaha.

Shri Mataji: „For Shiva you need not. [...] Just now we will do it. This is the gold we have to give. You have to burn ourselves, because Shiva is Sadashiva. What is there to burn anything?

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ recites the names in a row (without ‘swaha’).

At the name ‘Virata-Atma’ Shri Mataji interrupts: “Virata-Atma you see. In the Virata it resides in the heart. See the relationship.”

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ continue the names.

Mantras: the ‚master of ceremonies‘ recites the names, the people said: ‘Om Swaha’ and offer rice. A yogini aligned her left to Shri Mataji, stretched her left hand to the fire and put her right hand to Shri Mataji’s backagnya. Later on the right agnya (left side of the head) and the left vishuddhi.

Shri Mataji: By thought of the digestion, is the Swaha – is digest. That’s what you get with the word digest, is better Swaha - that digest, whatever is good for the body turns out and will be the best. All right? Whatever is not good [...]. Swaha is a digestive power of fire, is Swaha. Somebody ask: “Is Void?” Shri Mataji: “It’s all Void. Somebody say: “Intestines, [...]” Shri Mataji: “Intestines [...] liver, thoughts [...]. So, that’s what it is. Ingestion of the good and expeltion of the bad.

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads another Name, the people said: Om Swaha.

Shri Mataji: All this people worship fire for the same reason.

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads the name ‘Vivekinye’, the people said: Om Swaha.

Shri Mataji: These are all Viveka – attention, to the Angi again. The Agni, the fire of your Chitta. You see, when it gets enlightened it becomes Chitta. That’s why when - I cannot explain why, how I this things, because My [...]. First you have to become clean and then ‘Chittis’. So, this is a little gap in between.

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads the name ‘’Shuddha Chitta Pradayini ...’, the people said: Om Swaha.

Shri Mataji: Means the Agni, whatever you put into an enlightened persons Chitta, he knows how to sort out.

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads the ten names of the Adi Gurus and add Shri Mataji Guru Matreya Namaha, Shri Sarva Guru Matreya Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Namaha and Shri Sarva Sahaja Yogi Guru Matreya Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namaha.

Shri Mataji interrupts: That is the Guru Shakti also, because only if you have the Guru Shakti you can discriminate. You know who to burn out.

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads another Name, the people said: Om Swaha. He reads the name: Parama Viveka Pradayini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha

Shri Mataji: Now, for example Rajneesh was burned by fire. Fire means that [...]. Ahankara can be burned by fire. So many things can. (58:15)

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads the name: Om Shri Sarva Dushkripte Nashinye Namaha

Shri Mataji: And you appear like – you see when this flames you see - actually your Chakras appear like this, only like flames, but they’re very silent, there a beautifully burning of different colors. 

The ‚master of ceremonies‘ reads another Name, the people said: Om Swaha.
