Nabhi Chakra. February 1977

The Nabhi chakra, is placed at the center of gravity of every human being. If it is not there, that means it is going to be a little problem for you to get it in its right place.

There is a kind of a trouble which most of you suffer from, is maybe due to drugs or maybe nervous problems, due to war, or maybe some sort of a shock to your sustenance.

For example, during war people lost their values. Because they lost faith in God. Chaste women who believed in chastity were brutally assaulted. Very religious people were persecuted, families were broken, many men were killed and children, women, and old people were scattered. A very horrible atmosphere of insecurity overpowered all these nations.

Then came the concentration camps you see, also. Which shattered human beings because human beings are very delicate instruments. They are the coveted creations; they are the highest and they were dominated by things like bombs which are matter. Thus, the Spirit in man died out. People lost faith in righteousness, in love.
