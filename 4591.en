"The New Age" (Seminar), Plawhatch Hall (UK), 16 November 1980.

You can pick out people who are very seriously interested in Sahaja Yoga who are dedicated, who have passion for sahaja Yoga, who feel that it is the most important thing of life.

Now, you must have realized, that you are the people who are the men of God ' and women of God. And that you have to be prepared, to take this banner of New Age, of transforming Sahaja Yoga into Maha Yoga, into a vast area of spirituality. You are the channels, and you are going to generate this energy. If you were just channels, then your responsibility would have been much less.

But Sahaja Yoga is a very different type of a living process. Perhaps you might have noticed it, that once you receive your realization firstly it starts transforming you. Then it starts transforming others. By your presence you start transforming them, By your existence, you start transforming the atmosphere, the subtler problems of negativity, they all work out. Like a tree, when it is blossoming, the fragrance of the blossom creates a different type of aura, around itself, that it attracts all the bees around to gather the honey. In the same way, when a person is realized, is enlightened, the area spreads and you start getting people attracted towards you. You have to remember few points about Sahaja Yoga, that you receive the light first, the second step is that you generate the light, It is never done in any other process, that you generate the light, on your own, with your will, with your understanding, with your freedom. For example a tree may give rise to seeds and seeds might become trees. But seeds do not regenerate, they do not have a will.-Because here the seeds are human beings. Only the human beings have the will. Now you've been enlightened with your will. With your will you can regenerate, or you would say, you can generate on your own -Sahaja Yoga-to go further. It's a very subtle understanding, that when a light comes, into this candle, it cannot regenerate of it's will any other; somebody else has to take it to that. So your will is very important in Sahaja Yoga. "What do you will". That is very, very important.

Now will does not mean 'desire'. Will means desire put into action'. So what you do is to desire and then you put it into action. You can do it. First of all you have to know that we must have desire. That is there no doubt, You are categorically seekers. I mean you are that category, you are born as seekers, you cannot get out of it. You are seekers. Whatever may be your problems, from whatever source you might have come, whatever mistakes you may make, commit,-but you are seekers. Seekers are seekers. For example in this room if you see how many lights there are? At the most 6 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, you see, in both the rooms put together.

In this room only 5. Everybody is not a light. You are the light givers and it is going to work out through your will'. So how powerful our will should be? How dedicated we should be about our will? That, one has to know, you have to fathom out that will within you. Once you start doing this Sahaja Yoga, then you recognize how important is Sahaja Yoga that it gives a real meaning to the whole creation, in the eyes of God and divine power. That has to work out-that's the purpose of life. And surprisingly it is left to your will, not to my will. I've no will, I've no action. So it is your will, which is going to work it out. So you have to dedicate. And now you have to weigh yourself : How much I'm willed? The seminars help you to see how much you really will that Sahaja Yoga should be 'successful'. This is the second thing. To make it successful, what should we do? We must understand the basics of Sahaja Yoga, and try to see within ourselves "do we understand the basics and do we have those qualities by which we sustain those basics"?

The first basic of Sahaja Yoga is that you have to become your Spirit, so that your body emits the powers of Spirit alone. This is the first basic of Sahaja Yoga. So far, in all the religions, 'all' the great books, even Bible or Geeta, it is written that you must have faith. You must have faith. "Faith" word was never clarified in anyone of these books and mostly people thought blind'-faith is the only way to believe,-is to have blind faith. It should have been clarified. But it was kept a great term as : faith. They do use: Blind faith, and faith. So the people started working it out, for example you are walking on the road and you say I was thinking of God, and suddenly I found a gold ring, so that my faith was substantiated that it is God who has helped me to get the gold ring. Or say that there was a divorce or something like that and I prayed to God and the divorce did not take place; it is God's help. But this kind of praying can have another side, people can say that the people who do not believe in God at all are quite successful. Then how do you explain that? They have no faith, they are actually heathens, they are very successful in life. So how do you explain that side?

Sahaja Yoga has another very great thing, that is, it is revelation of all the great terms that were used before. Because people were not given realization, one could not talk of faith, or blind-faith and the real faith. Because if they do not have their eyes how can you tell them about the light or the darkness? So that time the faith was sustenance: How to sustain yourself? The second was to have faith that you will be resurrected, that you will be your Spirit.

Now the third stage is today, to know that realization gives you experiences, and then your faith is established. Not blind, but 'open-enlightened faith'. For example you come into this house and see for yourself what it is. And then have faith in that, that it is so. Believe in that, that you've seen it now you've seen 'Sakshat'. To have Sakshat means to get the whole thing which you've felt through your organs, five organs of perception. It's as clear as sunlight to prove it. So this way is the real thing, no conjecture, no just-talking-about-it. So all these words that were used in the scriptures are a ,revelation'. It means in 'actual' life you've 'seen' these things happening. Like I say ( ) Ha and the kundalini goes up, you've seen it many a times. I say ( ) Ha and you start feeling. That only by saying (Ha) and (Hoo) and (Hee) you get the vibrations. It is 'absolutely' there, now you can see for yourself. There is no just-'that it would not work out or may work out, may not work out, may be true, may not be true.'-All these things are not there. Its true absolutely.

But first and foremost is: 'You have to become your spirit." Without knowing the Spirit you cannot know God. But the Spirit itself is a sensitive thing. It is there no doubt, it stays there no doubt, but that it should ,shine in your attention. You have to know that your attention has to be congenial to the Spirit. If the attention is not congenial, then the Spirit doesn't shine. Spirit will shine on an attention which is steady. Steady it by balancing, you bring a steady state. Balance your thoughts, balance your eyes, balance your desires. Try to balance it. Ego and super-ego; you balance it. Attention is balanced very much like that.

Now how do you do with your will? First of all you desire and then you act. Where am I going? What am I doing? I am a seeker. Is this the thing I have to do as a seeker? immediately balance will come. So this balancing has to come; foremost thing is to balance yourself. Any extreme behaviour must be balanced. Any extreme attitude towards life must be brought down. Now, here we find that the will acts to oppose and in an opposite direction. For example people become obstinate. They do not want to accept that we have to balance and they say, "Oh! I am alright," and they'll give all explanations to show they are alright. For whom are you giving the explanations? You are fighting with yourself. Why? Because you are not yet integrated fully within yourself.

So the second point is the integration. Integration of your attention, Integration comes in when you do some thing, you wish the same thing, you enjoy the same thing. If you want something else, then you find integration is also wobbly in your attention. But if you want your Spirit, you just want your Spirit to be happy. Spirit is always happy. How are you going to make the Spirit happy? Only thing when you say, you want the Spirit to be happy, what you are saying is this, that you want your attention to be happy. If you keep your attention happy and cheerful, completely integrated with your being, not with your ego. This is where the discretion has to be used. So from balancing and integration we go to third point, is discretion because you are very senior members of Sahaja Yoga, very senior students. And now you know how to be discreet. What to take, what not to take.

It's very easy to criticize others, it's very easy to say others are wrong, but it should be the easiest to see what is wrong with you because you cannot correct others, you can only correct yourself. It's as simple as that! Like a daughter is married to another man, now supposing there is any problem between the two, it's better to tell your daughter than to tell the other man because she is your own. In the same way it is better to correct yourself than to correct others. It's the easiest thing to correct yourself if you could look at your ego which is stopping it. And who is the gainer? Who is the person who receives the benediction, and the bliss of Sahaja Yoga?

So the old habits that are within us which gives us obstinacy, must be seen with great discretion and now with all this training in Sahaja Yoga, you should be able to see even rationally the discretion part of it. I've seen people who go by a same road all the time are extremely discreet, they know how to turn, which turn to miss and which turn to take and how to reach. That's the sign of your maturity. So you have to be discreet. Another thing is that you have your vibrations there to teach you discretion. But sometimes you may be missing them. So with rationality if you discriminate and try to find out what is wrong, where am I going wrong, you will very easily understand that this part I am doing wrong and better check myself and nobody else. Because you are driving your own car. You can only control your brakes and not the brakes of another person. It's such a funny situation that people are driving every body else's car but not their own. So with discretion you will know how to correct yourself even rationally. Now your rationality is absolutely logical. Before, this, rationality was illogical. But now with integration your rationality becomes logical and it tells you "No, this is wrong, this cannot be." You know about everything now. Practically everything. I do not think there is anything that requires information for you people. Means you just try to think about something and you will get the answer. That's all in your brain. It's opened up, only thing that I said, develop your discretion. If you are indiscreet then you must develop it, you must grow up, you must mature. So then we go from discretion to understanding, that when we discriminate and find out things, what you have to do is to find our own fault, correct them discreetly. Why tell about others? What are we to do? If you people are of that level, that you catch from even a butterfly flying around you; and a little leaf failing from the tree. I mean if you were at that level then I would never have put you into this test. But you are not. You are capable of much bigger test than this and its nice to play with these, isn't it? Otherwise why should anybody even do hitch hiking. Leave alone hitch hiking, why should people swim? I mean better to sit on the bank and see everything. Even why go near the river. You may catch cold. So better sit in the house. And why even put on the light, you may see something and you may get frightened. So better to sleep. Even why to go to sleep, because you may dream. So that situation if it is there, that touch-me-not business, then I can tell you we cannot count. We are soldiers, and we have to develop immunities from all kinds of badhas from all kinds of people. Prom all types of Sahaja Yogis coming in, because this is a wide gate where every one has to come, all sorts. They may have hundred bhoots or they may have ten thousand.... "Come along. Whatever type of bhoots there are we know how to handle them."-This should be the attitude. Because I cannot give up any. I have to give chance to everyone. It is you who discriminate between these and you throw those people away. I just can't do it. I'm sorry ! Some people will come, shout at me, insult me, trouble me. Alright doesnt matter. They'll be alright. I can put them out of circulation, when they are absolutely useless. But till the end I will have to try. And if I find a slightest improvement, I'// catch on to them. I may have to work much harder with them. They may be much more closer than other people are. If they are lost people I have to look after them. So you must know that it is your responsibility that you should take your charge and look after the other things that Mother has no time to look after. That's what the quality you people are. That quality of people. All the Gods and all the Angels bow to you. They are in attention to you. You have seen even the Sun has come around, in these clouds just surrounded by clouds he is there. Then you have to come up.

And a small thing like collectivity, it's the beginning of Sahaja Yoga. If you do not want to become collective-Sahaja Yoga is not meant for individuals. This I must have said at least 6 years back, or seven years back in England and must be ten years back in India. Here you are coming to become a collective being because Spirit is the collective being. The quality of Spirit is that it is a collective being. It is a part of the collective. It is absolutely one with the collective. It is so collective that you cannot imagine on human level how much it is collective. For example yesterday I was criticizing Geeta and the vishuddhi was opened. Krishna is sitting here and talking through me. There is no difference at all of that. It's just the same. And I am Krishna, I am Mataji and I am Christ. So much one that you can't imagine how much oneness is there. It's such an unison that exists.

So for Spirit to be absolutely enlivened within us, to be absolutely shining within us, we have to know that how do we articulate with others? How do we talk to others? What is our way of judging?

But of course as I said that there are people about whom you should not bother at all. They are not interested in Sahaja Yoga. They are anti God. They are anti Christ. Forget them. They have started another movement towards hell, You cannot stop them. First start dealing with simpler people. But if anybody comes into my attention then you have to accept that person. But on your own you don't go on wasting your energy with them. I do not say that you go to one of these bhoots'    places and you just go and fight with them. No. If possible, try if it works out. But do not waste your energy with people, as Christ has said: "Don't cast pearls before the swines". Because, in the swine all kinds of parasites live.

So in collectivity those who are Sahaja Yogis those who have joined Sahaja yoga, there should be complete unison and articulation. Absolutely. And enjoy each other's company. Everyone is a beautiful flower. But I have seen people are more attached to other people who come in. Supposing a possessed person comes in.... We had a very good example in India, one of the ladies who used to come was possessed. She would every time come, sit in front, she would never sit at the back. And as soon as the tape would start she would go on like this, like that. I tried everything on her, we all tried, she could not be cured. And she was only interested in doing that. Then she would write poems for me and she wanted to read the poems. Most embarrassing thing. I told her, "Don't read", because all bhoots used to come out of her poem. We told her in so many ways. Went on for a year or so, still she was on and on, and she was just creating a problem for all the Sahaja Yogis. She was just a medium for all these bhoots to come in. And I told her many a times, you better not come here. Then I told her very frankly. Then I said, "you get out from here", I went up to that. Second year passed. Still she would not listen. Then I just told her husband that if she comes to the programme we are going to report it to the police. So her husband stopped her. But people have such sympathies you know, for such bhoots, not seeing that she is going against Mother, she is going against Sahaja Yoga, she is bringing all kinds of bhoots inside, and that why should Mother say all the time that she should not come? So when I went away she started coming again. Every body told her, "Baba! you don't come." But there were some sympathisers with her! "She is a lady, why should you say anything to her", this and that. But when she came once absolutely adamantly, people told her "if you don't go away, we'll throw you out". Still she would not go, she was just sitting down there.' So one of them kicked her purse outside. I mean what's the use of touching her purse also with your hands, you don't contact.

And then she got up to catch hold of her purse, because if the purse has gone out she couldnt, sit there. Since then she stopped. coming and went away. And there were letters from there, you see. "This doesn't look nice for Sahaja Yogis to behave like this and to throw away the purse like this, and this should not have happened, that should not have happened." I said this is indiscreet. If she is a bhoot. you tell her not to come, she is not wanted there, she cannot be a Sahaja Yogini, she is not a seeker, she is a medium of bhoots. Still she is troubling. Then who is sympathising ?-Naturally the people who are possessed. They sympathise with another possessed person. She is not a Sahaja Yogini.

The collectivity has to be with the Sahaja Yogis. Not with others. Because it is not there it is a fake thing. It's like "We are brothers and sisters." How are you? You are not feeling. It's not awakened within you. If a leaf says I am the flower, does she become? Leaf is a leaf and a flower is a flower. Among the flowers there should be collectivity. Because that's the natural thing that's there existing. Not with others. This is one thing which people do not know. how to discriminate. You are all one together but you'll fight among each other, and when as soon as others come in: "Come along, come along sit down." Surprising! I have seen this happening!

It's you who are my children. It's you who speak the same language. It's you who know everything. You are the people who are coveted. You are Princes.-They still have to become. That's a different point. You sit in your glory. The idea that all the saints should go to the feet of every third person. It's not that you are kings. You live like kings. You have to maintain distance from others who are commoners. Don't allow your ego to develop, of counsel But know that you wouldn't enjoy your kingdom unless and until you get more people into it. You've to get more and more and more but keep your dignity. You are at that level. Keep your poise. And then deal with others in the same manner "that you've joined together". You are the saints. One has to be assuming, assume one's powers. Assume; there is no pride. You are that, so you are that, so what is there to be proud of? I mean you are realized souls; finished. How to be conscious of it? You are that. So you are that. You are knowledgeable. You are knowledge. Once you realize that, then discrimination will work out much better. That you don't put down anyone, you don't discard anyone. But they are not the same as you are. This principle you must know. You are not saying that lower or higher or anything. But you are different, they are different. And they have to come and join you. They have to become. You cannot become like that, but they can become like you. So discretion is very important. In Sahaja Yoga, one of the very great basics for outgrowth, is to discriminate. Trust Sahaja Yogis, do not trust non-Sahaja Yogis. Never trust a non-Sahaja Yogi compared to a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogi is your brother or sister, is companion, is everything. And the others all others, they are another party, you are another party. They are not your enemies. They can come to this side. But they are not the same as you are. This must come into you. So the collectivity will grow strong. You should know, by fighting with each other you are reducing the power of Sahaja Yoga. By getting angry with each other you are reducing the power of Sahaja Yoga. Imagine if the channels start fighting with each other, how are you going to channelize the energy. So first of all, make your channel alright. And understand that we all channels put together are going to do the work better. We all have to be together. Togetherness is to be felt.

When the collectivity is disturbed what is the centre you catch ? Can you tell ? ... Vishuddhi; and Sahasrara-because I am the collectivity of all the Gods. And all the centres are in the brain, in the Sahasrara. And thirdly when it goes beyond a certain level, then you catch on your Heart. So Vishuddhi, Sahasrara and Heart; this combination starts. If Agnya left or right, any one of them joins in, you develop Ekadesha Rudra.

Now how through left vishuddhi and right vishuddhi we spoil other people? It's so evident. Supposing you have right vishuddhi problem. In Japan I went there. Japanese people you know have certain ideas, in which shyness and shame has no meaning. And a gentleman , who is the chairman of a very big international company, came to see me in a hotel. And he had a big thing on his mouth white some sort of a thing like a Hanumana. And I asked him, what's that supposed to be? And he talked to me and this thing was on his nose like that. I saw his right vishuddhi was very badly caught. Still I couldn't understand. So he said "I am sorry for this Madam, but this is there because I've got cold". So they put that thing on, whether you have to see the Queen or anyone. They will just put on that and then go and see. Because when you have cold, others catch. That's one thing that catches the fastest. Now you had cold so I have caught. So to get a cold one learns that if somebody has cold, he himself says "Today I've got cold you don't come". If you have to give an excuse to some one that you don't went to go anywhere, you say "Ive got flu."-Alright. It's alright don't come.--Nobody bothers.

So this is the right vishuddhi, you can see it very clearly. But left vishuddhi you cannot see, but feel. Left vishuddhi creates all kinds of social problems. Right Vishuddhi creates all kinds of political problems. For example those who have right vishuddhi are speakers. They have to talk too much. They may create problems with their right vishuddhi by talking too much-or by keeping quiet, both ways.     The left vishuddhi people say something    sarcastic, something horrible, something    nasty, sly, non-aggressive but screwing type. They might create holes into people you see. They don't believe in killing directly like that. So they want to do screwing up. Screw the person here and there. The relationship between right vishuddhi and left vishuddhi is very close, as much as the two sides of a coin. One side is aggressing, so on the right hand side when people speak to each other they oppress or aggress, they say aggressive things. Extremely aggressive things they say. We have seen people talking like that,-boastful, aggressive things. Left sided as I told you are the sly people, so they do it. Right-sided spoil the relationships by too much aggression, say for example one party man will stand up and say that "I am the one", the another will say "I am the one". The relationships between the political parties are ruined. They cannot articulate. The another side is the one, also cannot articulate. Because the relationship in the slyness when it goes down too much, ends up in perverted sex life. Then you go to somebody's house, you find a friend came to stay and he ran away with the mother-or some sort of a nonsense like that. So on the left hand side this kind of a funny relationship when you do not understand the purity of relationship in social life, that drops down, that creates problems. So in relationship right and left vishuddhi both of them play a very big part.

Then comes the Sahasrara. You know Sahasrara what it is. People want to judge me. They have a right to do 'it; I mean I cannot say no. You can judge me. You can do what ever you like. I mean I cannot say that you don't judge me. So we cannot say that you don't judge me. I cannot say. You go on judging me. Now what is the instrument, you have got to judge me? I have such a camouflage; just a bubble, and such a receding personality. How are you going to judge me? Is there any way of judging me? You can never catch me anywhere! It's a camouflage. Firstly I am prideless, I am egoless, I am actionless. Where are you going to catch me? On the contrary by all these attributes I create a problem for you, that I am a Mahamaya. You cannot understand a person who does not have pride. Because you all can talk to me very nicely, you can be very sweet and you can just sit next to me. And suddenly you come out with a remark which shows you are not conscious of to whom you are talking. Suddenly something you do where you are not conscious. Because I go on playing. I am extremely friendly with you, extremely nice to you. Absolutely prideless. You see anybody who has even this much position in life, he has a nose like that; mine is bent all the time! Nothing but humour. And then how are you going to understand my position? You see there is no outside sign. There are no horns, there is nothing that I could be a cinema star. I am too simple, too sweet. There is no way by which you can 'really' feel that I am great, I am absolutely mundane, ordinary. But extraordinary of the ordinary I am. This is a thing which people do not understand. It's alright for those who are not realized, excused. But you have felt the vibrations and got your realization through me. I must be something. Put your attention like that to understand. Must be tremendous thing inside this body. It cannot be possible otherwise. It's so obvious otherwise to you people.

This is to be understood, that so far Krishna, Christ, Rama, all of the them; nobody gave Self-realization to people en masse. They had other powers, like Krishna had Samhar shakti, he could kill any one like this. I have also all these powers with me, but obviously I am a very simple, ordinary, mundane type of an Indian lady. And Christ had a power to get Himself crucified. I too have that. But I am not going to do all that. I have a power to Resurrect also. Why these powers are not used? One should understand. Because now the main attention is to raise the Kundalini, and for that these powers are not required. Give realization to any number of people.

What's the use of getting crucified, who is going to raise the Kundalini? I would like to do it. I mean if I were at that time I would have said, "Keep your cross for a while I will have it later on". What's the use, just now, to destroy people? Let's see how many come around, you see. So these powers are not required. Today the power of raising the Kundalini of thousands &amp; thousands and millions &amp; millions of people is required.

And I am going to be just like you all my life. In the sense I am going to get old, as you're going to. I mean, today I should be old, I will be and be just like you! I am not going to do anything outside. It's like a German car. But it is you, who has to know the power of the German car. It's the best type. And once you realize that, that all is deliberately made like that. In the beginning of course, you cannot even understand it. It goes on: "how can it be, how can it be, She does this, She does that "it goes on like that. You do not judge me, because that's not the way you will understand. Just realize, and recognize, that there has to be something tremendous. It was necessary to have someone like that to do this 'tremendous' task. And it was necessary for you to be born, to be with me to help, I know those who are with me. They'll stand by me throughout. I may judge them a little here and there, but I know they will come round. You have to stand by me. Those who want to run away they'll run away, today or tomorrow. I'll try, I'll try to get them round, as far as possible.

So, we come to collectivity. To understand that you are cells in my body. And I have awakened you. If you degenerate, my body degenerates. You have seen that all. When you are sick., I am sick. In the sense I emit, liberate, more vibrations and I feel sick with that, because you can't take it. When you take vibrations I feel well. But those who have faith in themselves can only understand this and not those who have superiority complex, or inferiority complex. .. Complex means no faith in yourself. You should have faith in yourself that you are the chosen ones. You are really the people, specially 'made' for this great work. It's a 'tremendous thing' that you are a [I born. Once you realize and recognize it you would not bother about small small things of life. It's the quality in you that has to be nurtured and looked after, through collectivity. But collectivity of the 'Sahaja Yogis'. I know those who have proper reactions with things. Some Sahaja Yogi is coming; they feel very happy: "Oh he is coming!" You say," there are five people who got realization," they feel very happy. They will not sham, they'll be happy to go all out to see a Sahaja Yogi, to meet a Sahaja Yogi, to do anything for a Sahaja Yogi. This is the sign of a Sahaja Yogi. A Sahaja Yogi will go secretly and help a Sahaja Yogi in difficulty. Not just on money but anything.

This is a new race that is coming up. The others are human beings, you are not! You are not human beings any more. You are Sahaja Yogis. It's a different race. All over the world' this race has to come. up So we have to build up ourselves. In one group, in one understanding. Absolute unison. There should be no secrets, there should be no domination. Everything should articulate, every one should talk to each other,. every one should know what is happening with the other. You have to be 'absolutely' frank-open with each other. Absolutely. Tell them your problems. "I catch on this, what to do? I catch on that, what to do? How to clear it out?" Not to feel shy. We have to enjoy ourselves. Also enjoy our weaknesses, so that we clear them out. Laugh -it out. Somebody has some habits, laugh it out. That's the best way to do it.

The difference between a human being and a Sahaja Yogi is the same as a human being and a drunk fellow. I'll dive you a joke of a drunkard. There were two drunkards who were drunk. They went to a hotel. They wanted to have a room for themselves. God knows what they wanted, they did not know. So they went and told the clerk that they would like to have "two beds with a room". He didn't understand. "No, two rooms with a bed." So he said, "Alright you want to have a room with two beds." So he opened a room and said these are the beds for you. So fully clothed as they were, they slept in the same bed. So one calls to another. Says he, "There is somebody in my bed." Other one says, "I too have someone in my bed." So the first one says, "what should we do." The second one says, "lets try to throw them out" And there was a big struggle and lot of noise in the room. So the first one says "I've got him out." The second one says, "But he has thrown me out." So the first one says "Alright, you can come and sleep with me," because he has thrown him out, so what to do?. This is what they are !

This is the difference. So what is the use of arguing with them and getting angry, getting into tension. I mean they 'are drunk.' If you see a drunkard, run with the speed of five hundred miles an hour. That's my principle. NO use arguing with a mad man or a drunkard. May be mad man may be a bright, but drunkard,-till three hours he wouldn't digest his drinks. So that is what is the difference. They are drunk. They are drunk by power, drunk by money, drunk by that, something is there. And you are filled with the light of God Almighty. That is what it is, the difference is. If you understand the difference, you will realize that no use fighting with these people. They are drunk. They are like that. If you talk to them, what can you say, I mean, they don't understand. They just don't understand. Let's forget it, I will give you such tests and things by which you will come in. contact with them, see them and get out of it, without any harm being done to you. This is necessary; you have to touch them. You have to go near them, you have to be with them. You are outside. I give such tests to people and that should work out! I know you can, that's why I give such tests to only people about whom I'm sure, that they will come out. This I think we should decide today that, we all are going to live with One heart, and One desire, with One head and with One liver. All of us. Let's see, how it works out.

For example you go to a Hotel-five Sahaja Yogis. One says "I'll have that" every body will have that.-That's the sign. No decisions are needed. Why waste energy on decisions, arguments? Whether you eat fish and chips or chips and fish, is the same. The quarrel is like that; Sahaja Yogi does not waste his energies on this. You have seen your Mother, no choices. Just enjoyment. Where is the time to argue? It's joy pouring in. Let's enjoy.

May God Bless You.

See, why is the problem? That you have a will, that any thing else does not have the will. You have the will. And once you try to bring the will in tune with each other, you feel your ego is there, your ego hurts. You don't want to be, you dont want to lose that, or think that by doing so, you are becoming sub-normal. No . You are a realised soul, and a realised soul is something so 'unique' that you cannot give a parallel to it. There can't be a parallel. For example I can say, if there is a wind blowing then all the trees move in the same way. But human beings, if the wind is blowing .... Supposing any wind is coming, somebody will go that way, somebody will go that way, because they have a ,will'. But Sahaja Yogis, if the wind is blowing, all of them will put heir heads against the wind and fight it. This is a thing which 'cannot' be given any parallel, because you are going above human things. So far never such a thing has existed. You are such unique creations that there is ... I cannot compare you with anything that was below, or I should say, which was on this level. The level is different. So when you do everything the same way, you are doing it because you are 'aware' of that Collectivity of the Primordial Being within you. That's why you are doing. This transition is the point which you should catch. That's something I feel, that when you start giving any analogies and all that, how can you give an analogy for something that never existed before? Never, Atula .-which cannot be compared. That's one of the names of the Goddess. So, I cannot give you analogies, but I can make you understand that if your Spirit is awakened-in everybody is the Spirit which is a Collective Being,--then you do it because your Spirit does it. You don't care for ego, superego and all these nonsensical things, which are barriers in the growth of 'living' collectivity. Now you 'have' become 'livingly collective' and You are that. It's anew being that is within you. If you try to do something else, you will not like it, because this time it's not your ego but your Spirit. As before this you listened to your ego and were happy with it, now you will be happy if you listen to your Spirit. Because now you have become the Spirit. It's a very unique situation. You are the Spirit. And when you are the Spirit, then you become different. What analogies can I give ? Then the responsibility is more also to understand. in that, when you say yes, another says yes'. See in saying "yes" you'll feel happy. Supposing you say fish &amp; chips, another says, fish &amp; chips, another will say fish &amp; chips , everybody will say this. "Let's go to the, right", "lets go to the right," "let us go to the right,"-everybody will say. Unless and until there is somebody who 'knows' the job and says, "No, no. This is not the way. Right is not, the way. Let us go left." Everybody should 'know that he knows the way. So ,'Yes, let's go to the left". Arguments will fizzle out, because you are in 'unison'.

In second half I'll have to tell you about the nourishment of Sahaja Yoga, that will be the second half. But the first half is the basics, which I've talked of.

May God Bless You.
