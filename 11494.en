[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: What he is saying?
[Yogi translating in English]: He says this is very interesting. The most interesting thing is to know You. He says he is very materialized. But he hopes to dematerialize himself.
Shri Mataji: God is in everything. On physical level if you have problems then you have to use the gems.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Alright. Too much. Today I will tell about. Today I will tell you all the sides.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish] He is going to [London?][Not Clear]
Shri Mataji: Knowledge is within yourself. You don't need any book. [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He is just saying he is very angry with himself. Because he was meant to come at 9 o' clock and he had to work and he is going to.
Shri Mataji: He is good. Whatever he has done is good because now we are free to talk. [Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Second center, Swadisthana. Swadisthana is the second center
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: It's written down for the creativity. It also transforms your fat cells for your brain.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: No Umbiligo is third. []. Swadisthana actually comes out of umbiligo.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: This one is the one that goes on this. This one moves like that.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: This one is Swadisthana. This one is Mooladhara. Mooladhara chakra. This is Mooladhara. This is where the Kundalini rest. This is the one, is the virgin here. She is the virgin.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish] He says is the vital force within us Mother.
Shri Mataji: Yes, this is the force of desire. Become one with God. One with Divine. One with the whole, this is the desire.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Sacrum bone.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that in some people they have a very pronounced sacrum bone. Does he mean that they have a?
Shri Mataji: They have a bad Kundalini. [Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: It's frozen. [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Because you see the people who have a very pronounced coming out, any bone coming out is that chakra is bad. Any bone coming out.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And this coming out, you see. Outside
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish] [Yogi translating in English]: He says why the Kundalini is frozen. Is it because he has forced himself though this life through nasty [Not Clear] connections through eating habits?
Shri Mataji: You see if the Kundalini gets completely frozen if you are on extremes either on the left or on the right. If it is on the left it is absolutely frozen. If it is too much on the right then it is burning.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish] [Yogi translating in English]: He says what practically [naive?] [NOT CLEAR]. What does it mean to go to left? Does it mean the one...
Shri Mataji: It means that you go to the subconscious and collective sub conscious. Sort of the person who cries, weeps, thinks of the past and is very much all the time sly, inactive.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And the right side is over active, over ambitious, thinking of the future. So these are two extremes. But when then the Kundalini....
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Aah. That's it. That's it.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Yes.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Emotional. Emotional and this side is your physical. Physical and here is the thinking part. What you call, with the brain.
[Yogi translating in English]: On the right side
Shri Mataji: Right side.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Mental is, what is confusion because you see mental actually with the brain. If it means that. Mental activity is with the brain. And emotional activity is with the heart.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: With the heart. But what happens actually that when you act too much with your heart, your brain goes out. You act too much with your heart. Means emotionally you get dragged down then your brain goes out. You become mad. This is the balance you know. See the balance. Now when you work too much with your brains, your heart goes out. Mad people will never have a heart attack.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Ego. Ego comes from the right side to the left.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] [Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And other side is the Super ego, the conditioning.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: To the conditioning.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish] [Yogi translating in English]: He says a friend of his told him, that depends on people whose hands shows them if they are left sided or right sided.
Shri Mataji: When they shift
[Yogi translating in English]: The way they put the hands, Mother, show them and if they are left sided or right sided
Shri Mataji: Not important.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: You see, whatever is there is there. What you do makes no difference.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Do they have tea?
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: What he is saying?
[Yogi translating in English]: The knowledge is..
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that he has had very deeper experiences because he has been to lot of places. But just to look. And every time he meets people they very negative he feels a pain here.
Shri Mataji: You are very sensitive.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: That's the place of your guru principle, of your master principle.
[Yogi translating in English]:
Shri Mataji: Yes, his dharma. It's your religion. It's your sustenance. It is the sum of Ten Commandments. And when it is enlightened it knows who is wrong and who is right. That's why it happens to you because you have it, you see. A balanced person. So this thing, it acts you see, this acts and this guides stomach, guides. You find negative people. If somebody is negative and gives food to eat and I will just vomit it out.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says he is announcing Spain that anything that a food is made with love he feels well being in his stomach.
Shri Mataji: Love is God and love is everything.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And hatred is anti-god activity.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He wants to know. He says that in the universe there is a great force that is coordinating everything.
Shri Mataji: Yes, that evolves.
[Yogi translating in English]: That is coordinating and thinking the whole process of evolution and everything that goes against it is actually what we call evil.
Shri Mataji: Is destructive. This all pervading power is the power of God's love who serves you.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that if evil does. Evil he goes evil what men do wrong. Evil doesn't exist by itself. Evil is caused by what men do wrong.
Shri Mataji: Yes, a man, human beings have got the freedom. To do wrong or to do good. Because they have to learn. They have to learn with their mistakes. That's why sometimes we do wrong and then they learn, they improve themselves and they are all right. But if they go on doing wrong, then they go towards wrong and they will be evil.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He wants to ask Mother, in this flowing of God's power if man creates evil and even towards if there is evil by itself - that it is outside human beings that is going against God.
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see what has happened is when man started creating evil then this evil becomes malignant on its own and starts acting on its own. Just like a malignant cell in the cancer.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: I'll explain now how. See this is the center of our spinal cord. All right?
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Like these you can say. Now this is the left and this is the right.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Now you go too much on the left
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: So it is pulled down. Now the connection is broken with the whole. So you start going on your own. And you start using that destructive power and that's how you become malignant. Then the cells on this side will become big and start hitting others.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: In the same way in the whole the primordial being same thing happens.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: At different stages of evolution also some animals became like that. Some vegetables became like that. That's how we have viruses on the vegetables.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Some animals became like that. They were thrown out of evolution. But some of them became and they incarnated as human beings. In the ancient times they were killed many a times. Like a fox. A fox became very cunning and then was thrown out of the evolution. Then he became an asura called Kohlasura. Then there are many human beings also who did the same thing like Ravana and then they became malignant on their own. And they have come back now as false gurus.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: I followed him. What he is saying that all these things aggregate as a ego part of the ego you see. On that ego you see is the thing that, his question I did not follow but I followed what he was saying, 'Does that aggregate that time or something or do they form and aggregate?'
[Yogi translating in English]: If it comes and aggregates it forms the ego the evolution and now the things that attack the unity of...
Shri Mataji: Of course, very much. See what happens ego puts a circle round your heart
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And in the heart resides your spirit. So the light of the spirit cannot come. Like Hitler is an example. Hitler became ego oriented. Then he got other ego oriented king. Aggregated together. And they touched anybody they became ego oriented. See the aggregation added more strength to that. And they walk hand in hand and they never quarrel. Satans never speaks against themselves.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: A fake guru will never speak about another fake guru.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And I am the only one who speaks.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says he is very happy about that because you have spoken a new [dome?][Not Clear].
Shri Mataji: But you see I have spoken about them in 1970 openly everybody's name and what rakshasas they are, what asuras they are. I said their names. But nobody challenged Me. Nobody put Me in the court. Nothing.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: [The day ..mark?] [NOT CLAR] What is he saying?
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that you are very protecting.
Shri Mataji: I am protection Myself. I don't need any protection.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that he is very much impressed by you. You are very much like woman yet so Divine!
Shri Mataji: And certainly like it.
[Yogi translating in English]: So Divine as well.
Shri Mataji: See there are two sides to your Mother. She can be very cruel and She can be extremely mild.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Because all these horrible gurus are to be killed one day.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: They are already finished. They are finished because they are found out. Most of them are finished now. You can use their brains they will finish of. Because you see they can be finished in no time. But they have gone into the brains of the seekers. They are My children. So if they are killed they will also take with them all these people who are My own, whom I want to save. So it is a very delicate work.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says, Jesus, the good cross and the bad cross where Jesus says so like weeds in there. They can't wait in case there.
Shri Mataji: It's true, true. Whatever Christ has said can be proved. He said also your hands will speak. He said I will send you a comforter and a counselor and a redeemer.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that at least when [Not Clear] we are at the end of time.
Shri Mataji: What is it?
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that if this is true he means we are at the last judgment.
Shri Mataji: This is last judgment. You have reached the right conclusion. You'll be judged by Kundalini. And now, that's it.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: That's why so many people are taking birth who are realized souls. And also the ones who are seekers. This is the time they are to be judged. So the population has to be maximum.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says he accept Mother, all the people the population has grown just to be judged.
Shri Mataji: That's of course. Of course and they are mostly born in India because they are safe there.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Because in other places you see they are ill treating children and they are giving wrong ideas to children. They are ruining them. There is no love.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says these people are not in union. These people that ill-treat the children they are evil
Shri Mataji: They are evil. They are evil. They don't understand the value of children now. There are some great children are borne. Great sages are born.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Even in Spain there must be many born like that.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says this is last time Mother. Last opportunity, like a baker when he puts the bread in the oven. This is the last bread to be cooked.
Shri Mataji: That's very true. Very true. But what are they doing like mad people. See how many few come for judgment.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says everyone that comes will be judged.
Shri Mataji: Of course and they will be given the place in the kingdom of heaven. But they don't do.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says everyone will be judged not only difference between realized and non realized.
Shri Mataji: Everybody will be judged in a way those who will come. Will be given realization and they will go into the kingdom of God. And all others will be destroyed whether they come or not.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: All. The Ekadesha is coming big, great. You see the Christ is going to come with eleven destructive forces. Eleven destructive forces!
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that if Jesus is the comforter.
Shri Mataji: Not at that stage.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says Jesus came with love and forgiveness and was crucified. Will He come back to destroy?
Shri Mataji: He will not come now to Love. He will come to destroy. I have come to Love you first, to give you comfort.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: You can't crucify Me.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Because I am very powerful.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: He will shake before Me, before you.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: What's he saying?
[Yogi translating in English]: He says he knows that you see at nine.
Shri Mataji: That's true. There are one thousand. Show him the Lalitha Sahasranama. Have you got in Purtugal? Portuguese?
[Yogi translating in English]: In English
Shri Mataji: In English. All right. There are one thousand powers.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Descried in one book. In the Indian astrology they have described from 1970 I will start this work. That's what I have done.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: These are all the different powers described. One thousand powers. This is the one of the Shri Chakras. One of the Shri chakras, 'Lalitha Shri chakra'.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: My one name is Lalitha according to My sign. And the another is Nirmala meaning 'Nishkalantha' - means without any spot, pure, immaculate.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: But My surname is Salve. So, Immaculator Salve. In Spanish was translated for Gabriel when he met Virgin.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And now My surname, My husband's surname is 'Shrivastav' - means Holy Ghost in reality.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And English name is Daisy. My mother gave Me an English name Daisy. If you see the Daisy is the Sahasrara, whole.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Just like that. You see thousands, thousand things said in India. So it all combines. And there are prophecies made by this for Sahaja Yoga.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Even recently in 100 years. William Blake in England. He prophesized My coming.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: He says that, "The prophets, the men of God, is seekers, will become prophets and they will have power to make others prophets." He also described where I lived when I first came to London. He said England has to become Jerusulam, is the place of pilgrimage. And when I first came, came to London, I stayed in Sarah Hills. So he has described that. The first because to be lived in Sarah Hills.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And second, our ashram was the foundation was laid in Lambert Whale. He says, "The foundations will be laid in Lambert Whale. And Her sinews will vibrate the love" - sinews is the nerves.

[Shri Mataji talking aside to yogini]
Shri Mataji: Got it? What did they say?
Yogini: First I went to [Not Clear]. Then I went to embassy of Portland and they say well there is no place in the passport to put the visa. And then I said well...
Shri Mataji: I travel too much. You tell him.
[Yogini translating in Spanish]
Yogini: So they found a place to put it Mother.
Shri Mataji: Tomorrow we will have. This is the book. One person like you has written in English.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: We wanted to be translated in Portuguese.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: These are symbols. See people get a fright here if we tell them about swastika.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Ganesha. See what happened this Hitler used in the opposite direction
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: He used in the opposite direction, Hitler. That's it.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]

Shri Mataji: That is 'Surya', sun.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Zen
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: That is his Symbol. His Symbol is Christian. These are Sahaja Yogis, are realized souls.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: But the Kundalini is done there. All the details you see of Vishnu. And he has dealt with all subjects like tantrism, false gurus everything.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish] Tantrism? [Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: All this different. This is very good book.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: About who has written, he is a scholar. He is a same type you know. He is a... that kind. Same style. He must come from some family. What family he is from, ask him.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: She is Aragorn.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that he is middle class. His father is from Aragorn and his mother from Casteria Center. He is coming from Madrid. And he says he is to be different, I mean [Not Clear].
Shri Mataji: She is Aragorn.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]:
Shri Mataji: She is from Madrid.
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?
[Yogi translating in English]: He says this is a very beautiful place.
Shri Mataji: But he has never been to Madrid?
[Yogi translating in English]: That I don't. I don't think so Mother. He...
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: But mother is from where?
[Yogi translating in English]: Casteria. But he is Austrian.
Shri Mataji: Oh God. Then father is from Portugal.
[Yogi translating in English]: He is Aragorn, the other part of the Spain Mother.
Shri Mataji: I see. Then how you are called Aragorn?
[Yogi translating in English]: Because of his studies.
Shri Mataji: So this Catherine of Aragorn was Spanish?
[Yogi translating in English]: Yes Mother.
Shri Mataji: Then your mother side is Portugese, is it?
[Yogi translating in English]: Yes Mother, and French and Austrian
Shri Mataji: Mother is French and Austrian. Mixture. He is from Chili.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: There is an Indian guy here . He was a disciple of Krishnamurthy.
Shri Mataji: There was a lady who came to see Me. She has been to Adriad. and she started seeing My past, Laxmi, this thing, that thing. I was so surprised, I don't know. And her daughter is a great dancer there in Argentina
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: I forgot her name. She is famous daughter in Argentina. She learnt all her thing from Adriad. And the mother went there. And they are so much and on their subconscious she started seeing all My past.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: what is he saying about Krishnamurthy?
[Yogi translating in English]: He is saying that by teaching we have to go beyond maya.
Shri Mataji: How? He just talks.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says not to get involved with more maya.
Shri Mataji: He just talks. You see there is a background. I will tell you the background of Krishnamurthy.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: He was first with Plabasky. And Plabasky wanted to create something artificial out of him. She told that he is Shri Krishna and he carried on with that joke for some time.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: But Krishna has certain powers. And people, some realized souls at that time some saints challenged him and said you are not Krishna. For if you are Krishna you should have this powers or aura.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: So he got this illusion. And actually he was really blasted by people.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: For being Krishna. So that he accepted that he was not. But he could not, you see, reconcile to the situation that is nothing. For research that, there is nobody who can guide you. There is nobody who can guide you. All gurus are false. You have to guide yourselves. Because he himself was deceived by this lady. He pampered his ego. So you see there are false gurus, then false gurus must have reality somewhere. If they are false flowers there has to be real flowers somewhere.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Now, since he denied all of them then he told them you seek within yourself. You do this, you do that, again kriya, it is a kind of a Kriya. But this Krishnamurthy's disciples you see started mentally thinking that they have become something great. But it was just a mental projection. It was not a reality. And with that mental projection you see they just talk like him, "You are very big." But they are not beyond Maya or anything. I mean now if you see, if he cannot guide people, he should not talk. A light which is not enlightened cannot get enlightened by itself. It is another light which is enlightened. You cannot make the light get enlightened by itself. This is simple thing. But that's how he pampered the ego of the people that you can do it yourself. But if he cannot do it, how can anybody do it? This point you tell him that if he cannot do it. And why should a blind lead other blind?
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says Krishnamurthy says you have to pay complete attention on your all the sense organs. So nothing can deceive you.
Shri Mataji: But if you pay attention to your sense organs, what will you achieve? Because your attention is not enlightened. See the point. This is the point. You see the point?
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: Cannot be enlightened? He says we have light inside Mother.
Shri Mataji: We have. The light has to come into your attention. That is the yoga.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Alright, only after realization that happens. Your attention, you see. He is following the point. But never mind.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in Spanish]: Zen?
Shri Mataji: This is Zen. Sahaja Yoga is Zen. But real 'Zen'. They do artificial thing. In every religion they have done artificial thing. Like in the Zen it was said that now you have to become a 'Kashyapa', means a realized soul. So that you are enlightened and whatever you do has started enlightenment. But they start moving their hands without enlightening them, without any force flowing from them. What is this? They do all the movements, as I said yesterday before starting the car if you move the wheels, the wheels will break and the car will break and you will be finished.
[discussion] 
Shri Mataji: That has happened.
[discussion]
Shri Mataji: Now Mohammed Saab told us to do Namaz. It's nothing but the Kundalini awakening. Like a stone in Mecca is described in the old Indian scriptures as Macceshwara Shiva.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He is asking where in India
Shri Mataji: in the scriptures, in the puranas.
[Yogi translating in Spanish] Does the Gita says?
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: What kind?
Shri Mataji: There are two puranas. Shiv Purana
[Yogi translating in English]:
Shri Mataji: And so she said that [Not Clear] and all these Namaz is nothing but Kundalini awakening. But they do it without understanding. He also talked of the resurrection time, all the time, all the time. Very little about the 'doom'. But Muslim just talk of the doom. Not of the resurrection. Fanatics.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says soon they will be coming to Spain and Europe.
Shri Mataji: No, they are finished by themselves. They are fighting. We have now many Muslims as Sahaja Yogis from Algeria. They have become Sahaja Yogis now.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: They are trying to [Not Clear] overtake Europe.
Shri Mataji: Even if they come to Europe it should be a better Sahaja yogi. Because they are all interested in themselves.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He thinks that the Arabs, the Muslims are going to overtake Europe. It was predicted by Nostradamus.
Shri Mataji: By what?
[Yogi translating in English]: As it was predicted by Nostradamus.
Shri Mataji: But also he has said that they will be destroyed. That's all. Don't worry. In Paris we are getting them into Sahaja Yoga. Then we will get them in Spain. First the Spanish should be alright. You see the best way is to get them into Cancer. Sahaja Yoga had everything thing that cures cancer and so they come to Sahaja Yoga.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says through Yoga you get the union and you get united with the whole.
Shri Mataji: That's how your cancer get cured. We cured of a cancer, one Sahaja Yogini, actually by My photograph, cured the cancer of one lady from Algeria - blood cancer. And now she prays to Me and to Shri Ganesha. She does her Namaz before My photograph.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He has got a friend. A Friend of his has in his house a known God when he worshipped Shiva and Ganesha and he has given him an introspective of Shiva.
Shri Mataji: But without connection what is the use?
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says he has also got an altar a different one
Shri Mataji: Doesn't matter. But now you will know from vibrations without reaching Ganesha you will [Not Clear] reach Shiva. Now what happens that once you are connected then you understand better.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And then you know how to worship, where to worship, everything you know.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: That's My planet, Pluto.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says he knew it was your planet and before Mother he was saying that you were from Pluto.
Shri Mataji: It came on this earth when I came in.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: No, No, is Ruby. But this is we wear in the glass.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: I wear all the jewels.
[Yogi translating in English]: He says Ruby is related to the planet Mars.
Shri Mataji: No, No. Coral.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Effects Mars can be controlled by Coral.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]:
Shri Mataji: Neptune. According to us, it is, Coral is from Ganesha.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]

Shri Mataji: Luna Pluto is what?

Shri Mataji: clairvoyance, Lunar and Neptune?
Shri Mataji: Pluto is the Pluto. It is not, the Lunar and Pluto combination is yoga. It is yoga. See Lunar and Pluto, because Lunar is the spirit.

Shri Mataji: Planet of the Swadhisthana is Budha, is the Mercury;
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: And the stone that is to be used is yellow Sapphire. Yellow Sapphire, for the Swadhisthan.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: It is like diamond.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Sapphire is not a precious stone. So the Sapphire which is yellow color, we call it as "Pukhraj". Which is actually like diamond, above diamond. No, that is yellow Sapphire. It is above that. You see it gave you the impression of a diamond. We call it as Pukhraj. Good for the guru principle. He knows how to cast things come, is it?

Shri Mataji: Place is in center of India. In India, in all center.

[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He is saying that his friend, Andrew is his name, is a very spiritual person and he needs some kind his ego to be pampered. And he will do it. Not him Mother. But he will do it and it would be impossible to bring him tonight.
Shri Mataji: All right! Give him a bhandan.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: You will have more knowledge and he will run, Andrew.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Andrew, his ego will be reduced. He asked because you are a special person.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: This friend says he knows everything. And whatever other people know is because he is teaching them.
Shri Mataji: He told you only half truth.
[Yogi translating in Spanish]
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Now you teach him.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He is saying whatever his friend needs he has to ask him to get him because the other one cannot. Shri Shiva's statue it was him who found for his friend. And the mandal of Shri Ganesha he found it for him. And the cup full of water almost pure crystal, it was him who found it too. And he says, he says he knows everything, it's me who does the things for him.
Shri Mataji: Now we have to do for you.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He says that [Not Clear]. In the north mother-earth and south fire. And east the air. And west, water.
Shri Mataji: What is in the center?
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: It must be wood he says.
Shri Mataji: In the center is the ether, firmament. And this is upside down. This is upside down. Earth is down below, Kundalini. What is this on your left side?. Down below is Earth. Earth is in the base. See, I will show you here. This is the Earth, this is fire, this is water, this is ether. So this is the ascent.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
[Yogi translating in English]: He saying all this is from down upwards. He is seeing from side to side.
Shri Mataji: Like this also you can have side to side, that's the same. But you see this is all this is right side. All this is right side. Five elements are on the right side. Everything is on the right side. Left side is the emotional side. That is mana. This creates 'Para Shakthi'. And this creates 'Itchha Shakthi', 'Manas-Shakthi'. Manush, psyche. This creates psyche. This side creates all the five elements are here. All the Vedas have worked on the right side. And all the worship and dedication is on left side. In between the two is the power of evolution through sustenance. You get sustenance. Here you have carbon. Here you become all the universe, matter. Here lies stars, that evolves. Here to be a bhakta, Gods devotee. Then on the right side if you move you become a good king. The kingdom and all that the politics on the right side. And the left side are the people who sings and the one who worships God and sort of what you call, worshippers. Then you go up here, from here to here. Here evolution takes place actually, takes place in the sense that you raise your head the whole. This is the Virata. This is the work of Shri Krishna. But at this stage, he is just a Leela, is the play. He came on this earth six thousand years back. Rama came on this earth eight thousand years back. Then came Christ here at this point about two thousand years back and now it's Me. I have all of them within Myself. This is the door through which you have to pass. And in the heart resides the Shiva. But the seat of Shiva is here, Sadashiva. But he resides there. So when the Kundalini rises, She pushes the attention like this, see like this, and touches Shiva. And then the spirit starts flowing into you. And then you start feeling on your central nervous system of cool breeze. Then you start feeling all these centers on your hands. That is what is Sahaja Yoga, so this is all the knowledge of the right hand side, is of no importance to us. Because you go beyond. You become the spirit, you go beyond. You have to have the knowledge of the spirit and the Divine power and it's yours. As I come to say, I must know, knowledge about Spain roots. If I go to the Gods kingdom so you have to now.
