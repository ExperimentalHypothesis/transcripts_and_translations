Conversation With Joseph At Lunch, Madrid (Spain)

[The seeker Joseph will be speaking in Spanish and a Sahaja Yogi will translate]
Shri Mataji: Hello.
Joseph (seeker) : Hello.
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. You give him bandhan. Something or you give the booklet.
May God Bless You.
Shri Mataji: Just a minute. We’ll come, we’ll come. Now the second center of Swadishthan. Swadishthan, second center moves all over.
No, No. That is third center. You see the second center.
Give him, give him that. You write it in it.
What he is saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He says this is very interesting. The most interesting thing is to know You. He says he is very materialized. But he hopes to dematerialize himself.
Shri Mataji: God is in everything. On physical level if you have problems then you have to use the gems.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Too much.
Today I will tell about. Today I will tell you all the sides.
Sahaja Yogi: He is going to [London?][unclear]
Shri Mataji: Knowledge is within yourself. You don’t need any book.
Sahaja Yogi: He is just saying he is very angry with himself. Because he was meant to come at 9 o’ clock and he had to work and he is going to.
Shri Mataji: He is good. Whatever he has done is good because now we are free to talk.
Second center, Swadishthana. Swadishthana is the second center. It’s written down. It is for the creative, for creativity. It also transforms your fat cells for your brain.
No, umbiligo [umbilicus] is third [center]. Swadishthana actually comes out of umbiligo.
This one is the one that goes on this. This one moves like that. This one is Swadishthana. This one is Mooladhara. Mooladhara chakra. This is Mooladhara. This is where the Kundalini rest. This is the one, is the Virgin here. She is the Virgin.
Sahaja Yogi: He says is the vital force within us, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes, this is the force of desire to become one with God, one with Divine. One with the whole, this is the desire here. Sacrum bone.
Sahaja Yogi: He says that in some people they have a very pronounced sacrum bone. Does it mean that they have a?
Shri Mataji: They have a bad Kundalini. It’s frozen.
Now, because, you see, the people who have a very pronounced coming out, any bone coming out is that chakra is bad. Any bone coming out. And this coming out, you see. Outside
Sahaja Yogi: He says why the Kundalini is frozen? Is it because he has forced himself though this life through nasty connections through eating habits?
Shri Mataji: You see, if the Kundalini gets completely frozen if you are on extremes, either on the left or on the right. If it is on the left, then it’s absolutely frozen. If it is too much on the right, then it is burning.
Sahaja Yogi: He says what, practically, naïve, what does it mean to go to left? Does it mean the one -
Shri Mataji: It means that you go to the subconscious and Collective Subconscious. Sort of the person who cries, weeps, thinks of his past and is very much all the time sly. Inactive.
And the right side is over active, over ambitious, thinking of the future. So, these are two extremes. But when then the Kundalini -
[Joseph speaks in Spanish and Shri Mataji answers directly; he says something like “negative mental”]
Shri Mataji: Ah! That’s it. That’s it. He understood.
[Joseph repeats in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Yes.
[Seeker goes on in Spanish, Shri Mataji answers without translation]
Shri Mataji: Emotional. Emotional and this side is your physical. Physical and here is the thinking part, what you call, with the brain.
Sahaja Yogi: On the right side
Shri Mataji: Right side. Mental – mental word is very confusing because, you see, mental actually means with the brain, if it means that. Mental activity is with the brain. And emotional activity is with the heart. With the heart. But what happens that, when you act too much with your heart, your brain goes out. You act too much with your heart, means you go emotionally too much, it drags down, then your brain goes out. You become mad. Means the balance you know, see the balance. Now when you work too much with your brains, your heart goes out. Mad people will never have a heart attack. Ego. Ego comes from the right side to the left [part of the brain]. And other side is the superego, the conditioning, to the conditioning.

Sahaja Yogi: He says a friend of his told him, that depends on people whose hands shows if they are left-sided or right-sided.
Shri Mataji: When they shift.
Sahaja Yogi: The way they put the hands, Mother, show them and if they are left-sided or right-sided.
Shri Mataji: Not important.
Shri Mataji: You see, whatever is there is there. What you do, makes no difference.
Do they have tea?
Joseph: Yes, a little bit...
Shri Mataji: What did he is say?
Sahaja Yogi: Without sugar.

Shri Mataji: What he is saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He says that he has had very deep experiences because he has been to lot of places. But just to look. And every time he meets people they very negative he feels a pain here.
Shri Mataji: You are very sensitive. That’s the place of your guru principle, of your master principle. Sat [real]. Yes, his dharma. It’s your religion. It’s your sustenance. It is the sum of Ten Commandments. And when it is enlightened, it knows what is- who is wrong and who is right. That’s why it happens to you because you have it, you see. He’s a balanced person. So this thing, this thing acts you see, this thing acts, and this guides you, stomach guides you.
You find with negative people, if somebody is negative and gives me food to eat and I will just vomit it out.
Sahaja Yogi: He says there is an old saying in Spain, that any food that is made with love, will feed well the stomach.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Shri Mataji: It’s true. Love is God and love is the religion. And hatred is anti-God activity.

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to know Mother. He says that there is, in the universe, a great force that is coordinating everything.
Shri Mataji: Yes, that evolves.
Sahaja Yogi: That is coordinating and thinking the whole process of evolution and then everything that goes against, is actually what we call evil.
Shri Mataji: Is destructive.
This All-pervading Power, the Power of God’s love, rules everything.
Sahaja Yogi: He calls evil what men do wrong. Evil doesn’t exist by itself.
Shri Mataji: Evil?
Sahaja Yogi: Evil is caused by what men do wrong.
Shri Mataji: Yes. A man, human beings have got the freedom to do wrong or to do good, because they have to learn this. They have to learn the wisdom. That’s why we, sometimes, do wrong and then they learn. If they improve themselves, they’re all right. But if they go on doing wrong, then they go towards wrong and then they create evil.
Sahaja Yogi: He wants to ask Mother, if there is, in this flowing of God’s Power, if man creates evil, he wanted to ask if there is evil by itself – that it is outside human beings that is going against God.
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see, what has happened is when man started creating evil then this evil becomes malignant on its own and starts acting on its own. Just like a malignant cell in the cancer. I’ll explain now how. Say, this is the center of our spinal cord. All right? Like these, you can say. Now this is the left, this is the right. Now you go too much on the left. So, it is pulled out. Now the connection is broken with the whole. So you start going on your own. And you start using that destructive power and that’s how you become malignant. And then the cells on this side will become big and start hitting others.
In the same way, in the whole, the Primordial Being, same thing happens. At different stages of our evolution also, some animals became like that, some vegetables became like that. That’s how we have viruses, from the vegetables.
Some animals became like that. They were thrown out of evolution. But some of them became [evil] and they incarnated as human beings. In the ancient times, they were killed many a times. Like a fox ; a fox became very cunning and then he was thrown out of the evolution. Then he became an asura called Kohlasura. Then there are men, human beings also who did the same thing like Ravana, and then, they became malignant on their own. And they have come back now as false gurus. For him, it’s clear [Is this? Unclear]
Sahaja Yogi: It’s so complicated Mother.
Shri Mataji: I followed him. What he says, that all these things aggregate as a ego part of the ego you see. On that ego, you see, is the thing that - the question I did not follow but I followed what he was saying, “Does that aggregate, attack or something? And do they form and aggregate?”
Sahaja Yogi: If those aggregates are forming the ego in our evolution, and do these things attack the unity?
Shri Mataji: Of course, very much.
Joseph: It’s true.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s rue.
Shri Mataji: See what happens, ego puts a circle round your heart. And in the heart resides the Spirit. So the light of the Spirit cannot come. Like Hitler is an example. Hitler became ego oriented. Then he got other ego oriented things, aggregated together. And they touched anybody, they became ego oriented. See the aggregation added more strength to that. And they walk hand in hand and they never quarrel. Satans never speaks against themselves. A fake guru will never speak about another fake guru. And I am the only one who speaks.
Sahaja Yogi: He says he is very happy about that, because you have opened a new door.
Shri Mataji: But you see, I have spoken about them in 1970, openly, everybody’s name and what rakshasas they are, what asuras they are. I said their names. But nobody challenged Me. Nobody put Me in the court. Nothing.

Shri Mataji: [The day ..mark? unclear] What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He says that you are very protecting.
Shri Mataji: I am protection Myself. I don't need any protection.
Sahaja Yogi: He says that he is very much impressed by you. You are very much like woman yet so Divine!
Shri Mataji: And certainly like it.
Sahaja Yogi: So Divine as well.
Shri Mataji: See there are two sides to your Mother. She can be very cruel and She can be extremely mild.
Because all these horrible gurus are to be killed one day. They are already finished. They are finished because they are found out. Most of them are finished now. You can use their brains they will finish of. Because ,you see, they can be finished in no time. But they have gone into the brains of the seekers. They are My children. So, if they are killed, they will also take with them all these people who are My own, whom I want to save. So it is a very delicate work.

Sahaja Yogi: He says, Jesus, the good cross and the bad cross where Jesus says so like weeds in there. They can't wait in case there.
Shri Mataji: It's true, true. Whatever Christ has said can be proved. He said also your hands will speak. He said, "I will send you a comforter and a counselor and a redeemer".

Sahaja Yogi: He says that at least when [Not Clear] we are at the end of time.
Shri Mataji: What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: He says that if this is true, he means we are at the Last Judgment.
Shri Mataji: This is Last Judgment. You have reached the right conclusion. You'll be judged by Kundalini. And now, that's it.
That's why so many people are taking birth who are Realized souls. And also the ones who are seekers. This is the time they are to be judged. So the population has to be maximum.
Sahaja Yogi: He says he accept Mother, all the people, the population has grown just to be judged.
Shri Mataji: That's of course. Of course. And they are mostly born in India because they are safe there. Because in other places, you see, they are ill treating children and they are giving wrong ideas to children. They are ruining them. There is no love.
Sahaja Yogi: He says these people are not in union. These people that ill-treat the children they are evil.
Shri Mataji: They are evil. They are evil. They don't understand the value of children now. There are some great children are born. Great sages are born. Even in Spain there must be many born like that.
Sahaja Yogi: He says this is last time Mother. Last opportunity, like a baker when he puts the bread in the oven. This is the last bread to be cooked.
Shri Mataji: That's very true. Very true. But what are they doing like mad people? See how many few come for judgment.
Sahaja Yogi: He says everyone that comes will be judged.
Shri Mataji: Of course, and they will be given the place in the kingdom of heaven. But they don't do.
Sahaja Yogi: He says everyone will be judged not only difference between Realized and non-Realized.
Shri Mataji: Everybody will be judged in a way. Those who will come will be given Realization and they will go into the kingdom of God. And all others will be destroyed whether they come or not.
All. The Ekadasha is coming big, great. You see, the Christ is going to come with eleven destructive forces. Eleven destructive forces!
Sahaja Yogi: He says that if Jesus is the comforter.
Shri Mataji: Not at that stage.
Sahaja Yogi: He says Jesus came with love and forgiveness and was crucified. Will He come back to destroy?
Shri Mataji: He will not come now to Love. He will come to destroy. I have come to Love you first, to give you comfort.
You can't crucify Me. Because I am very powerful. He will shake before Me, before you.

What's he saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He says he knows that you see at nine.
Shri Mataji: That's true. There are one thousand. Show him the Lalitha Sahasranama. Have you got in Purtugal? Portuguese?
Sahaja Yogi: In English
Shri Mataji: In English. All right. There are one thousand powers described in one book [Lalita Sahasranama]. In the Indian astrology, they have described from 1970, I will start this work. That's what I have done.
These are all the different powers described. One thousand powers and this is the one of the Shri Chakra. One of the Shri Chakra, 'Lalitha Shri Chakra'.
My one name is Lalita according to My sign. And the another is Nirmala meaning 'Nishkalanka' - means without any spot, pure, immaculate. But My surname is Salve. So, Immaculator Salve. In Spanish was translated for Gabriel when he met Virgin. And now My surname, My husband's surname is 'Srivastava' - means 'Holy Ghost' in reality.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
And English name is Daisy. My mother gave Me an English name Daisy. If you see, the daisy [flower] is the Sahasrara, whole. Just like that. You see thousands, thousand things were said in India. Son it all combines. And there are prophecies made by this, made for the, for Sahaja Yoga. 

Even recently in 100 years. William Blake in England. He prophesied My coming.He says that, "The prophets, the men of God means seekers, will become prophets and they will have power to make others prophets." He also described where I lived when I first came to London. He said, "England has to become Jerusalem, is the place of pilgrimage". And when I first came, came to London, I stayed in Surrey Hills. So he has described that. The first because to be lived in Surrey Hills.
And the second, our ashram was laid, the foundation was laid in Lambert Vale. He says, "The foundations will be laid in Lambert Vale. And Her sinews will vibrate the love" - sinews is the nerves.
Also this new house I have is also very clearly described. And the Sahaja Yogis have painted it with gold. You see. So, he calls them the Golden Builders. 

You also have some lunch with Me. Please. Please have. Some lunch.
[Joseph speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: No, in the Mother's house, you have to eat.
Sahaja Yogi: He says he is [Not Clear] some of you [unclear]
Shri Mataji: That's good. You are such a great [fan?][unclear]. I am so happy to meet you.
You are very positive. You must come to London and meet others like you.
[Seeker Speaking in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: To Me, of course, but there are so many of your brothers and sisters. You show him the Advent that is written by Gregoire, Gregoire. A book for you - it's too much, much too much.

[Shri Mataji is talking aside to a Sahaja Yogini]
Shri Mataji: Got it? What did they say?
Sahaja Yogini: First, I went to [Not Clear]. Then I went to embassy of P.... [?] and they say well there is no place in the passport to put the visa. And then I said, "Well"...
Shri Mataji: I travel too much. You tell him.
Sahaja Yogini: So, they found a place to put it Mother.
Shri Mataji: Tomorrow we will have. This is the book. One person like you has written in English. We wanted to be translated in Portuguese.
These are symbols. See, people get a fright here if we tell them about 'swastika'.
Ganesha. See what happened: this Hitler used in the opposite direction. He used in the opposite direction, Hitler. That's it.
That's Me.
That is 'Surya', Sun.
Zen
That is his Symbol. His Symbol is Christian. These are Sahaja Yogis, are Realized souls. But the Kundalini is done there. All the details, you see, of Vishnu. And he has dealt with all subjects like tantrism, false gurus everything.
Joseph: Tantrism? [Sahaja Yogi translating in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: All this different. This is very good book.
About who has written, he is a scholar. He is a same type you know. He is a... that kind. Same style. He must come from some family. What family he is from, ask him.
She is Aragon.
Sahaja Yogi: He says that he is middle class. His father is from Aragon and his mother from Casteria Center. He is coming from Madrid. And he says he is to be different, I mean [unclear].
Shri Mataji: She is Aragorn.
She is from Madrid.
What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He says this is a very beautiful place.
Shri Mataji: But he has never been to Madrid?
Sahaja Yogi:That I don't. I don't think so Mother. He...
Shri Mataji: But mother is from where?
Sahaja Yogi: Casteria. But he is Austrian.
Shri Mataji: Oh God! Then father is from Portugal.
Sahaja Yogi: He is Aragon, the other part of the Spain, Mother.
Shri Mataji: I see. Then how you are called Aragon?
Sahaja Yogi: Because of his studies.
Shri Mataji: So this Catherine of Aragon was Spanish?
Sahaja Yogi:Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Then your mother side is Portugese, is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, and French and Austrian
Shri Mataji: Mother is French and Austrian. Mixture. He is from Chile.
Sahaja Yogi: There is an Indian guy here . He was a disciple of Krishnamurti.

Shri Mataji: There was a lady who came to see Me. She has been to Adriad. and she started seeing My past, Lakshmi, this thing, that thing. I was so surprised, I don't know. And her daughter is a great dancer there, in Argentina. I forgot her name. She is famous daughter in Argentina. She learnt all her thing from Adriad. And the mother went there. And they are so much and on their subconscious. She started seeing all My past.
What is he saying about Krishnamurti?
Sahaja Yogi: He is saying that by teaching, we have to go beyond maya.
Shri Mataji: How? He just talks.
Sahaja Yogi: He says not to get involved with more maya.
Shri Mataji: He just talks. You see, there is a background. I will tell you the background of Krishnamurti.
He was first with Blavatsky. And Blavatsky wanted to create something artificial out of him. She told that he is Shri Krishna and he carried on with that joke for some time. But Krishna has certain powers. And people, some Realized souls, at that time, some saints challenged him and said you are not Krishna. For if you are Krishna, you should have this powers or aura. So, he got this illusion. And actually, he was really blasted by people for being Krishna. So, that, he accepted that he was not. But he could not, you see, reconcile to the situation that is nothing. For research that, there is nobody who can guide you. There is nobody who can guide you. All gurus are false. You have to guide yourselves. Because he himself was deceived by this lady. He pampered his ego. So you see there are false gurus, then false gurus must have reality somewhere. If they are false flowers, there has to be real flowers somewhere.
Now, since he denied all of them, then he told them, "You seek within yourself. You do this, you do that". Again kriya, it is a kind of a Kriya. But this Krishnamurti's disciples, you see, started mentally thinking that they have become something great. But it was just a mental projection. It was not a reality. And with that mental projection, you see, they just talk like him, "You are very big." 

But they are not beyond maya or anything. I mean now if you see, if he cannot guide people, he should not talk. A light which is not enlightened cannot get enlightened by itself. It is another light which is enlightened. You cannot make the light get enlightened by itself. This is simple thing. But that's how he pampered the ego of the people that you can do it yourself. But if he cannot do it, how can anybody do it? This point you tell him that if he cannot do it. And why should a blind lead other blind?
Sahaja Yogi: He says Krishnamurti says, "You have to pay complete attention on your all the sense organs". So nothing can deceive you.
Shri Mataji: But if you pay attention to your sense organs, what will you achieve? Because your attention is not enlightened. See the point. This is the point. You see the point?
Sahaja Yogi: Cannot be enlightened? He says we have light inside, Mother.
Shri Mataji: We have. The light has to come into your attention. That is the yoga.
All right, only after Realization that happens. Your attention, you see. He is following the point. But never mind.

Sahaja Yogi: Zen?
Shri Mataji: This is Zen. Sahaja Yoga is Zen. But real 'Zen'. They do artificial thing. In every religion, they have done artificial thing. Like in the Zen, it was said that, "Now you have to become a Kashyapa", means a Realized soul. So that you are enlightened and whatever you do has started enlightenment. But they start moving their hands without enlightening them, without any force flowing from them. What is this? They do all the movements. As I said yesterday, before starting the car, if you move the wheels, the wheels will break and the car will break and you will be finished.

[Conversation]
Shri Mataji: That has happened.
[Conversation]

Now Mohammed Sahib told us to do 'namaz'. It's nothing but the Kundalini awakening. Like a stone in Mecca is described in the old Indian scriptures as 'Macceshwarshiv'.
Sahaja Yogi: He is asking where in India
Shri Mataji: In the scriptures, in the Puranas.
Sahaja Yogi: Does the Gita says?
What kind?
Shri Mataji: There are two Puranas. Shiv Purana. And so he said that [unclear] and all these 'namaz' is nothing but Kundalini awakening. But they do it without understanding. He also talked of the Resurrection time, all the time, all the time. Very little about the 'doom'. But Muslim just talk of the doom. Not of the Resurrection. Fanatics.
Sahaja Yogi: He says, soon they will be coming to Spain and Europe.
Shri Mataji: No, they are finished by themselves. They are fighting. We have now many Muslims as Sahaja Yogis from Algeria. They have become Sahaja Yogis now.
Sahaja Yogi: They are trying to [unclear] overtake Europe.
Shri Mataji: Even if they come to Europe, it should be a better Sahaja yogi. Because they are all interested in themselves.
Sahaja Yogi: He thinks that the Arabs, the Muslims are going to overtake Europe. It was predicted by Nostradamus.
Shri Mataji: By what?
Sahaja Yogi: As it was predicted by Nostradamus.
Shri Mataji: But also he has said that they will be destroyed. That's all. Don't worry. In Paris, we are getting them into Sahaja Yoga. Then we will get them in Spain. First, the Spanish should be all right. You see, the best way is to get them into cancer. Sahaja Yoga had everything thing that cures cancer and so they come to Sahaja Yoga.
Sahaja Yogi: He says through Yoga you get the union and you get united with the whole.
Shri Mataji: That's how your cancer get cured. We cured of a cancer, one Sahaja Yogini, actually by My photograph, cured the cancer of one lady from Algeria - blood cancer. And now she prays to Me and to Shri Ganesha. She does her 'namaz' before My photograph.

Sahaja Yogi: He has got a friend. A Friend of his has in his house a known God when he worshipped Shiva and Ganesha and he has given him an introspective of Shiva.
Shri Mataji: But without connection what is the use?
Sahaja Yogi: He says he has also got an altar, a different one.
Shri Mataji: Doesn't matter. But now you will know from vibrations without reaching Ganesha you will [unclear] reach Shiva. Now what happens, that once you are connected, then you understand better. And then you know how to worship, where to worship, everything you know.
That's My planet, Pluto.
Sahaja Yogi: He says he knew it was your planet and before Mother, he was saying that you were from Pluto.
Shri Mataji: It came on this earth when I came in.
No, No, is 'ruby'. But this is we wear in the glass.
I wear all the jewels.
Sahaja Yogi:He says 'ruby' is related to the planet Mars.
Shri Mataji: No, No. Coral. In fact, Mars can be controlled by Coral.
Neptune. According to us, it is, Coral is from Ganesha.
Luna. Pluto is what?
Sahaja Yogi: Only Neptune he is saying clairvoyance.
Shri Mataji: Clairvoyance, Lunar and Neptune?
Shri Mataji: Pluto is the Pluto. It is not, the Lunar and Pluto combination is yoga. It is yoga. See Lunar and Pluto, because Lunar is the Spirit. You see, planet of Kundalini is Mother Earth. Planet of the Swadishthan is Buddha, is the Mercury. And the stone that is to be used is yellow sapphire. Yellow sapphire, for the Swadishthan.
 It is like diamond. Sapphire is not a precious stone. So the sapphire which is yellow colour, we call it as "Pukhraj". Which is actually like diamond, above diamond. No, that is yellow sapphire. It is above that. You see, it gave you the impression of a diamond. We call it as 'Pukhraj'. Good for the guru principle. He knows how to cast things come, is it?
He knows how to pass the horoscope.

Sahaja Yogi: His friend the one who worships Ganesha. He knows how to pass a horoscope.
Shri Mataji: Ask him to pass through My horoscope. I was born at zero hour.
Sahaja Yogi: He says he is going to his place to meet him, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Let him see. I was born at the equinox between Pisces and Aries. At the zero hour, twelve 'o clock. 1923.
Sahaja Yogi: Place, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Place is in center of India. In India, in all center.
Sahaja Yogi: Which town Mother?
Shri Mataji: Chhindwara.
Sahaja Yogi: He is saying that his friend, Andrew is his name, is a very spiritual person and he needs some kind his ego to be pampered. And he will do it. Not him, Mother. But he will do it and it would be impossible to bring him tonight.
Shri Mataji: All right! Give him a bhandan. You will have more knowledge and he will run, Andrew.
Andrew, his ego will be reduced. He asked because you are a special person.
Sahaja Yogi: This friend says he knows everything. And whatever other people know is because he is teaching them.
Shri Mataji: He told you only half truth.
Now you teach him.
Sahaja Yogi: He is saying whatever his friend needs, he has to ask him to get him because the other one cannot. Shri Shiva's statue, it was him who found for his friend. And the mandal of Shri Ganesha he found it for him. And the cup full of water almost pure crystal, it was him who found it too. And he says, he says he knows everything, it's me who does the things for him.
Shri Mataji: Now we have to do for you.
Sahaja Yogi: He says that [unclear]. In the north mother-earth and south fire. And east the air. And west, water.
Shri Mataji: What is in the center?
Sahaja Yogi: It must be wood he says.
Shri Mataji: In the center is the ether, firmament. And this is upside down. This is upside down. Earth is down below, Kundalini. What is this on your left side?. Down below is Earth. Earth is in the base. See, I will show you here. This is the Earth, this is fire, this is water, this is ether. So this is the ascent.
Sahaja Yogi: He saying all this is from down upwards. He is seeing from side to side.
Shri Mataji: Like this, also you can have side to side, that's the same. But, you see, this is all, this is right side. All this is right side. Five elements are on the right side. Everything is on the right side. Left side is the emotional side. That is 'mana'. This creates 'Para Shakthi'. And this creates 'Itchha Shakthi', 'Manas-Shakthi'. Manush, psyche. This creates psyche. 

This side creates all the five elements are here. All the Vedas have worked on the right side. And all the worship and dedication is on left side. In between the two is the power of evolution through sustenance. You get sustenance. Here you have carbon. Here you become all the universe, matter. Here lies stars, that evolves. Here to be a bhakta, Gods devotee.

Then on the right side if you move you become a good king. The kingdom and all that the politics on the right side. And the left side are the people who sings and the one who worships God and sort of what you call, worshippers. Then you go up here, from here to here. Here, evolution takes place, actually. Takes place in the sense that you raise your head, the whole. This is the Virata. This is the work of Shri Krishna. But at this stage, he is just a Lila, is the play.

He came on this earth six thousand years back. Rama came on this earth eight thousand years back. Then came Christ here at this point about two thousand years back and now it's Me. I have all of them within Myself. This is the door through which you have to pass. And in the heart resides the Shiva. But the seat of Shiva is here, Sadashiva. But he resides there.

So, when the Kundalini rises, she pushes the attention like this, see like this, and touches Shiva. And then the Spirit starts flowing into you. And then you start feeling on your central nervous system of cool breeze. Then you start feeling all these centers on your hands. That is what is Sahaja Yoga. So, this is all the knowledge of the right hand side, is of no importance to us. Because you go beyond. You become the Spirit, you go beyond. You have to have the knowledge of the Spirit and the Divine power, and it's yours. As I come to say, I must know, knowledge about Spain roots. If I go to the God's kingdom, so you have to know.

[End of talk]
