1989-03-06 Shri Shiva Puja Delhi

[Hindi to English translation]

Today is a particularly auspicious day. On this special day, I have two things in mind that I have been thinking about for many days. Firstly, an ashram, at the very least, should be established this year, and then another ashram should be established afterward. We all want to work honestly towards that goal. In this Kaliyuga, during these initial days, working honestly brings many adversities, obstacles, and crises. However, the greatest solace is that we are honest. And in Sahaja Yoga, one must understand that whatever is meant to happen at a certain time will definitely happen at that time; it cannot be obstructed. If there have been any obstacles, they were necessary. Whether it took more time or less time, whether it cost more money or less, all of it was necessary. Therefore, we should not find faults in anything but should fully enjoy it. And we should keep in mind that the very first ashram of Sahaja Yoga in India got established in Delhi. Despite efforts across the entire country, this has not been accomplished until now. This endeavour has been ongoing for eighteen years, and today we see this ashram, bringing great joy. The full responsibility for this was given to you, and all the hard work was done by you; the credit for this achievement also belongs entirely to you. When you give me credit for anything, I don't understand it, because it seems you have become so detached from action that you don't realize that it is all your doing. If I could do everything myself, why would I need you? You are my hands, you are my eyes, and you are my ears. Without you, I can't do anything, and for this in a way, I can say to you, the devotees, that whenever you need me, I will be there, and wherever you tell me to be, I will get established there. But your authority over us should remain intact, and when that authority is maintained, fulfilling this responsibility becomes very easy. Now, I don’t even know how much money I gave for this, or to whom I gave it. All this money belongs to the Sahaja Yogis; I didn’t give a single penny from my own pocket. But I also want to give from my own pocket because you are building a room here for me as well. So, I should also contribute some money. You all are doing the work, but I should also give money. Sahaja Yoga is a festival of joy, an ocean of bliss. If you find joy in everything, then you should consider that you are experiencing the sensitivity of Sahaja Yoga. However, if you do not feel that joy and its presence, then you should consider that there is still something lacking in you. Whatever difficulties you faced and whatever you had to endure while making this, it is all just a game. And we enjoyed playing this game in our own way. Building a house, setting up a shop, creating a world, it's all a game. If you worry too much about how the world will be created and what will happen, you will lose all the joy in it. But you are building, you are observing, seeing how God's play unfolds. If your attention is pure, if your attention is true, and if there is love in your heart to do something for the work of the Divine, then the joy becomes doubled. It increases even more, and the vibrations envelop you further, giving you such an experience in those waves that you say; "Now I am blissful." What more can be said? That's how I feel today, seeing all this play. I have created the whole world, but seeing what has been made here, it's like a doll's game. When you build a small house for a doll, it brings immense and wonderful joy. In the same world, our ashram is established, and I am feeling the same experience towards it. Today is also a very auspicious day because on the day of Mahashivratri, the day when the essence of Shiva manifests within us, that day is today, the day when Lord Shiva is worshipped. Shiva signifies something unbreakable, immutable, immortal, and today something else has been created that manifests these three pillars of unbreakable, immutable, and immortal. This is indeed a great fortune and a very auspicious thing for the whole world. Let us understand it in this way: amidst all the turmoil in this entire world and the calamities of the world, the torment of Kali Yuga, and its fierce dance, at such times, there should also be a pivot that we can hold onto. For that pivot, a Ganesh element must be established. To establish that Ganesh element, something must be placed on the earth element. Similarly, today, the Ganesh element has been seated here, sanctity has been brought here. What has become of this sacred temple, and from here, sanctity can spread throughout the world, and whatever work is done here can be done very efficiently. Every kind of attack, aggressive people, and this seemingly small ashram can accomplish a lot. So, it is said that nuclear, and in this way, it is that. What has been created first in India today, is Lord Ganesha. But before them, and even before the primordial power, there was a ‘Tatwa’; we will call that ‘Tatwa’ as the form of Sadashiva, eternal Shiva. The ‘Tatwa’ of Sadashiva, the power that came from him everywhere, we call it the primordial power. So, the first thing that exists and will always exist in the world, whether it is in a dormant state, then no creation happens, "But when it remains in an awakened state, then all creation take place." At that time, all kinds of creation continue to happen. Then, after that, incarnations come, and all kinds of activities occur. And then, when those things eventually fall asleep, everything returns to a dormant state again. Before reaching that state of dormancy, we should immerse ourselves in the awakening that is the essence of Shiva. Understanding the essence of Shiva is not difficult for an Indian because here, in the land of India, whether they are Indian, foreign nationals, or influenced by foreign cultures, it doesn't matter; but generally, any Indian you meet will say that attaining this immortal essence is the goal of our lives. Everything else is perishable. We know this. All other things are perishable. And running after perishable things is not a matter of intelligence at all. Perishable things exist where they are; they be in their limits. But giving them more importance than necessary leads towards destruction. This is precisely what the essence of Shiva is. We need to attain that, which is also the goal of all our actions and activities, and that is our center and source. This is something people outside India don't understand. In foreign countries, people give a lot of importance to perishable things, they run after them, considering them important and thinking that they can benefit from them. Many people may not even be aware of the immortal essence, and those who are, often just confine it to thoughts and principles, and they make it into, so to speak, a big managing-tool. But there is no life in it; there is no vitality in it. The vitality it has is the essence of Shiva, and we know that. We know that all work can be accomplished through this immortal essence of Shiva only.  Even if our brain stops functioning in some way, we are still alive. Even if our hand breaks, we are still alive. Even if our leg breaks, we can still survive. Even if our backbone breaks, we can still survive. But as soon as the heart stops, then we cannot survive in this world. Here lies the essence of Shiva; we should understand the essence of Shiva, which is extremely innocent.  Innocence doesn't mean foolishness; innocence means purity, extreme purity. Just like if you spread a pure substance here and there is even a small stain on it, it will immediately be visible. Similarly, the essence of Shiva is such that even if you make a slight mistake, it will be clearly visible in the light of the Shivtatva. Now, if you understand this Shivtatva, what importance it holds in our lives, then what you know as consciousness today, the awareness that you feel within you, that is the manifestation of the Shivtatva. And until Shiva is awakened within you, your soul is not awakened within you; you cannot attain this principle. You cannot realize it; so, knowing its realization is an understanding; this is what the Vedas call Vid. This is what we call knowledge, which is wisdom. This is to know the essence of Shiva. Now, whether there is the Shivtatva or not, you know that; you have no doubt whether there is the Shivtatva or not. But think whether we are grounded in the Shivtatva or not. The biggest rule of the Shivtatva is that it is love, the source of love, the goal of love, the center of love; it is love. The greatest thing is to open your heart; to immerse yourself in the love of the Shivtatva means to open your heart. In it, the thought does not even arise that now, with time, the heart remains completely open; we should see what things sit in opposition to it. When in opposition, there are selfishness, possessiveness, 'mine, my husband, my children, my home is happening.' Where possessiveness begins, there the Shivtatva begins to end. Now, look at where Lord Shiva resides? On Mount Kailash, where no one can live, He resides there. As for what clothes He wears, you already know. Their adornments and the exuberance in which they dress, you also know. But they have no need for comfort, like what comfort will I get. We first think –Bhai! they are going there, so how many star hotels are there, what arrangements will be there, whether these things will be okay or not, what kind of accommodation will be available there, what arrangements will be made, and what kind of food will be there? They don't care about these things. The first recognition of those with the Shiv element is that they reside in joy wherever they are. Put them to sleep in the jungle, they are at peace in the jungle, place them in palaces, they are at ease in palaces. Wherever they are, there they are Shiv. There is nothing higher than that from which they can derive joy because of being inherently joyful, and what else is there to derive joy from? Everything else is just rubbish. The real ultimate thing they have found within themselves, in the joy of Shiv, so for them, what special thing could there be that could suppress or entice them? There won't be any special thing for them. From this, you can understand that if the essence of Shiv resides within us, then first, we become the kind of person known as a saint, what we call ’Auliya’. You can sleep anywhere, sit anywhere, eat anywhere, eat at any time, sleep as much as you want, and this clock, it stops ticking. You've transcended time; there's no thought about when to go, when to come, or what to do and when. Whatever is happening is fine. If you're sitting here now, then you're sitting here; tomorrow, you'll be sitting there. There's no thought about it, like, "Okay, it's time now, let's go, now we have to do this there," none of these mental calculations occur to you. Because what is happening is happening according to the wheel of time. That's why I said, when it will be made, how it will be made, there's no need to worry about it. When the deserving people are there, then it will be completed; when there are people worthy of living here, then it will be fulfilled. Otherwise, who will live here? Will animals come and stay here? Birds will come and stay? I told them, first, figure out who are the ones from Delhi going to live here. They said, "Maa! You will stay." I said, "Which ashram am I going to live in? Tell me. So don't make an ashram just for me; first decide how many of you from Delhi want to live in the ashram. Because Indians are very restricted; they want their own home, their wife, their children, and they want to show off to their wives; on top of that, they want a car." "Mine, mine, these things are mine. I have my children with me, my wife is with me. How many people are there who can live collectively? This question doesn't arise in foreign countries. If an ashram is built in a foreign country, it is quickly established because everyone brings their own bedding and other things. What happened just now? We were at home, now we are in the ashram. Now all our problems have disappeared because there's no rent to pay, no complaints, no issues." "We will just stay here, live collectively, whatever money is needed to be paid we shall pay, and live comfortably. Everyone will work together, and there will be no problems. If any trouble arises, everyone will come together to address it, and if something special happens, everyone will enjoy it. They become so happy that they feel like they've gained something, as if they've become a part of something, which we call belonging. We belong to something." "And we, constantly, roam around sticking to each other. Well, even in that house, within the house, then arguments start that this is the elder son, this is the younger son, this is the elder daughter-in-law, this is the younger daughter-in-law; then this is their child, then my sister, then this sister-in-law, even in that, arguments start. Because these relationships are artificial relationships; this is not real relationship. If someone becomes someone's son, then it doesn't become their relationship, if it did, then why would there be an argument?"   "Meaning, there is no reality in this, then why are there demands for small things, why isn't there love for each other, so the way we tell you, that external religions are all false, similarly, anyone outside is false, so they say every day, 'Ma, please get me out of this, my life is spoiled, how did this happen?' I said, first of all, call Ma, and call Ma, now my life is spoiled, now who will do anything about it?" "How do I get rid of it, I feel used-up because of it. I said, why did you call first, and why are you sending it? The reason is that this relationship was not true relationship. If there was a true relationship with it, then it would be immersed in love and remain sweet. There is no feeling in it that it's mine."  My feeling is, this is a false emotion. This true feeling is not at all there. If true feelings were there, and then you tell me, in which relationship have you seen that if a person has a complaint, then everyone will stand with him? Instead, if they come into Sahaja Yoga, they will pull your legs. If you come into Sahaja Yoga, they will say to you, if you don't get us well, then we won't let you enter into Sahaja Yoga. Then they will create more drama. Because the Shivatattva is truth, and everything else is falsehood; and you know the relationship of Shivatattva, it is with consciousness. When you feel this light with consciousness, you know there is consciousness; so you understand how much joy is coming from the one sitting in front, how much joy I am in. Once a gentleman came to me in Kolkata. As soon as he came to my feet, eight to ten Sahaja Yogis came running. I asked, 'What happened? Why?' I don't know, suddenly Kundalini got awakened. So we came to see what happened to the Mother. It was an instant realization, that's the work; they caught hold of him. Now they all stood up and said to him, 'Get up.' The poor thing was sitting there humbly. I said, 'Leave him alone. The joy he was experiencing was not like that of a rose flower, it was like that of a lotus flower. He was enjoying it in such a way. When this real connection happened, they were sitting there and said, 'What fun is this!' They came running from there. When this enjoyment started coming, then it's a relationship. This is true friendship. This is the inspiration of true Sahaja Yoga, love, and its joy. This can only happen through the Shivtatva. If the Shivtatva is within you, then you cannot quarrel with each other. You have seen the Ganas, how they are. At a mere gesture, all the Ganas come together to do even the most difficult tasks, the most challenging tasks, they all gather and start doing it together. However, if here, when the Shivtatva's full system starts, I have seen that if something is understood, if an event happens in America, then all the Sahaj Yogis rush there; if an incident occurs in Australia, then everyone's attention is there. This is a big thing.   But first of all, in this, we should know that we are situated in the Shivtatva. Being situated in the Shivtatva doesn't mean that we have to become ascetic babas, but there should be a feeling of renunciation from within. Saying that there should be a feeling of renunciation from within means that just like within a tree, its power, which is like sap inside it, grows and goes into every root, every leaf, every branch, every flower, every fruit, and then comes back.  Similarly, your love too, absolutely unconditionally, completely detached, will be in the state of non-attachment. And when you become like that, then you will be situated in the Shivtatva, and when you become like that, then you will enjoy each other. Otherwise, looking at each other, saying, "They did this, they did that." In the beginning it felt like I have entered a quarrelsome household, where everyone was quarreling with each other.  Neither are you enjoying each other, nor does anyone love each other. Their quarrel is with them, their quarrel is with them. I keep looking and thinking, "Oh God, what should I do now? My role here seems pointless. But slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, the minds cooled down, the establishment of the Shivtatva began, and now people are enjoying mutual love, and they are realizing that the love among them is the most significant, and even experiencing the relationships is starting to come; this is what it is? Your relationship is only based on one thing, and that is the Shivtatva. If a person doesn't have the Shivtatva, if a person doesn't have vibrations, if their vibrations aren't right, then your relationship with them cannot establish. No matter how hard you try, that relationship won't form until their vibrations are right. Until then, no matter what you do, you can't enjoy being with them.  Either your vibrations will become negative, or their vibrations will become negative. So, you'll feel like it's their vibrations that are negative. Then you'll wonder, "Have I become negative, is there something wrong with me, or is it because of them?" And you'll enter a kind of delusional state where you won't understand what to do. Therefore, if someone's vibrations aren't right, you should stay away from them; there's nothing wrong in that. Both benefit from it; if you are awakened to the Shiva principle, then you should stay away from them. This doesn't mean you should say good or bad things about them, but their Shiva principle should also be corrected, and you should also tell them to correct their Shiva principle. Because if such people come in between, then there can never be happiness, just like if you put curd in milk, what will happen. Everything is detached, so it doesn't work. If you put curd in milk, it will turn into curd. No matter how many theories you apply, that theory doesn't work. Go in front of it, pray, greet, do something, put curd in milk, and those whose vibrations are bad should be completely removed, so that your vibrations will be corrected, and everything will be fine. And looking at your peace, they will say about your Shivtatva, "Yes! Alright, how peaceful this person is sitting, I should also sit in such peace. Why shouldn't I attain this peace? Why shouldn't I enjoy it? When your life moves towards that peace, simplicity, and love, then other people whose vibrations are not right, who are not yet sitting comfortably in Sahajyoga, will gradually settle down. But everyone should strive to understand where our benefit lies.

Our benefit is not to wander and wander like mad. Obtaining that eternal thing is the goal of our life, and that's why we have come into Sahajyoga. And if, after coming into Sahajyoga, we remain incomplete, then what's the use? What have we gained? If we sit halfway on the path we have embarked upon, we won't reach the destination at all. I have talked many times about this Shivtatva and explained it, but especially for the people of Delhi, Shivtatva should be discussed. So, the thing about Shivtatva is that you should know that when the heart catches you, your Agnya Chakra catches. But on the contrary, if I say, if your Agnya Chakra catches, the one in front, then your heart suddenly contracts, becomes very small. And when your Agnya Chakra opens, your heart becomes completely cool, and vibrations start flowing from it. The Agnya Chakra rises with ego. Because you live in this capital city and see people riding horses. You also think, "Why are these children crying? You should see them." When I came to Delhi after getting married, I felt like this is a strange world. Here, people walk on the ground but their heads are held high. And until you talk to them yourself, no one will understand them. It was a strange world of arrogance. Oh my! At that time, when I was a very young girl, I used to laugh at where these crazy people are going, straight to the Yamuna, going to some ghat; I couldn't understand anything. And then I used to watch, and I would be quite amazed, everyone's head is held so high from here, about six inches up, and the reason for this is arrogance, so much arrogance. Even a maid, when she would come home wearing a shimmery suit, with lipstick all smeared, I thought she must be the madam of the house. Nails painted, lipstick on, wearing bangles, absolutely fashionable; and I looked like a village woman in front of her. So I thought she must be the madam of the house, so I said to her, "Please have some tea, sit on the sofa"; she hesitated, I said, "Please sit down, why are you standing, sit down." She started saying, "How can I sit?” I said, "Please sit down, why are you standing, sit down." "Who are you?" I am the wife of your peon, so I said, "No problem, please sit down now." And then I saw, she had so much pride in her, I realized she was even more proud than a collector. So I said, “If this is their condition, then what the collector’s wife would be like!” And with so much pride, deceit, and artificiality in life. I had come from Nagpur, so I felt, what kind of world is this, I just couldn't understand anything. Strange experiences started happening. Like when my husband came, he was with Shastri ji. In this world, it's a big deal, but I couldn't understand what's so great about it. So we met a friend, she used to study in our college. She wasn't talking to us at all. So I said hello. Where do you live? Then we found a place in Meenabagh, she said, you live in Meenabagh? What does your husband do? Bhai! They do something; they have a government job, that's it. So you live in Meenabagh, whom did you marry, you didn't find anyone else. I said, "Bhai! my husband is a very good man." "Good! What does he do?" "Why are you living in Meenabagh?" I thought to myself, who lives where in the whole world, what positions they hold, she knows everything. I asked her, "Where do you live?" She said, "I live in Rau’s Avenue." I asked, "Where is that?" So she said, "It's near the bridge." I said, "Then it must be far from here, right?" "Oh, so what if it's far? I have a car. No matter where it is, I live with pride." "My husband is like this, my husband." Initially, I didn't understand the meaning of all these prepositions like "additional" and "under". I used to ask my husband, "What's the difference between 'additional' and 'under'?" He started saying, "Well, you have a lot of intelligence, but you can't play his three cards. You don't remember which thing is higher or lower. You won't even remember bureaucracy. So I said, "Sir, I don't understand what happens with all these prepositions, what's up and down in them." Anyway, whatever it is, she ran far away from me as if she were the clerk's wife or something. I don't know. So I said to her, "Bhai! It’s okay, I live in Meena Bagh, so there's no need to get so upset." The place the government has given us, we live there. So she started saying that; just then my husband arrived. Now, Bhai! Here everyone greets the chair, whoever it may be, so as soon as he came, everyone greeted together, "Namaste, Namaste, and Namaste." So she also started greeting him with "Namaste". Then she said, "Why didn't you greet?" "He is my husband, why should I greet him?" She started saying, "He is your husband, why do you live in Meena Bagh? Is it like some Yerwada jail, Meena Bagh? What's the big objection in that?" She started saying, "He is your husband! Oh, you are the wife of a big man." I said, "I don't know about that, but my husband is quite tall." So she started saying, "You're just a simpleton, you should have demanded a mansion in such and such place." I asked, "For what?" Then she said, "Wow, if he's such a big shot, don't you want a big mansion?" I said, "Bhai! I prefer a small house. It's difficult to maintain cleanliness in a big house.” “There's no maid in house." I said, "Yes, but it will require a lot more work." So it's better to have a small house." Here, there was so much artificiality, superficiality in conversation, just superficiality and showiness. After that, she must have understood that she would call me every day, I was so troubled. I said, "What's going on with this?" She used to get anxious from Meena Bagh and now she's sitting there every day waiting to come. I just don't understand. When I saw things like this, I wondered what's going on in the minds of people here. If you tell a cat that it's a horse, then while the horse is galloping away, what will happen to the cat? Similarly, the situation with the people here is that every person doesn't know what they understand about themselves. And all these outwardly flaunted pieces of pride they carry, who knows which pride they're flaunting? This will all collapse tomorrow. All these things will fall apart; they are all perishable. What's the value in them? Today, anyone, no matter how bad, how much of a loafer, whatever they are like, if they are sitting on a big chair, so everyone standing with folded hands, are they someone beyond reproach? What kind of person sits on the chair? Whether good or bad, if that person gets off the chair, ask about all their dirty secrets. As long as they are on the chair, consider them to be even greater than God. You would be surprised that many people, when they came to meet my husband, would ask like, "Is ‘Bhagwan ji’ there?" So I would say, "Which ‘Bhagwan ji’? Sir, Mr. Shrivastav, sir." "Wo ‘Bhagwan ji’ is he there, ‘Bhagwan ji’?" So I said, "Then who is Mr. Shastri?" They said, "He's the Supreme Being." "And you?" I said, "I'm just a servant here." So since then, I tease my husband, calling him ‘Bhagwan ji’. They say, "Enough now, stop teasing." The arrogance, the forcefulness, the insistence, and the special thought that comes to women, "Oh, I'm his wife." "I didn't even know where my husband is, how much, what his position is. They know all those people, they know the entire civil list, who is what, their number is this, oh, and their number is that. I said, are you making a list of horses or why are you making such a list? Why do you talk like this? And I couldn't understand those people's conversations." "Because they kept discussing while sitting. He got this promotion and he got promoted. Good educated women, educated. These women were educated along with we people, neither to study nor to write anything, nor did they know anything, except for which job their husband had. In the light of that, they were engrossed (unclear)! Get away from this artificial life completely, just leave this artificial life altogether." All this ‘Maemsahbiyat’, it's over now, it's time to come to reality, because we are Sahaja Yogis. And for a Sahaja Yogi, it's necessary to wear the tidy clothes, to abide by the rules, to stay dignified. All these things are fine, but within limits. Within their limits. And when you remove artificiality from it, then you will see that the essence of Shiva is shining within you. Your dignity is being observed by the world," they say! "Oh, what a thing it is!" Then, they should descend from any height, whether they sit on a chair; whether they go outside or inside, the whole world desires them by their name. This is the essence of Sahaja Yoga. There should be such a character, such a special nature, just like Shiva did have that He forgave even those demons, In this way, we have to accept that the element of forgiveness has settled within us, then no one can disturb us, no one can cause us pain because when we don't even remember who caused us what trouble, then what sorrow can affect us?

To delve into this essence, you must first understand that a Dilli is neither a cat is nor a horse, and a horse do not sit on a cat. Otherwise, the cat dies. It's not to think that just because we live in Delhi, we're somebody. Once you start thinking like this, your entire character becomes comical and idiotic. Another amusing incident is that a gentleman went to meet a minister, and there he was very much in unrest. He was asked, "Sir, why are you in unrest so much? Don't you know I am P.A.?" They said, "Oh, you are P.A.! Well, ‘Namaste!" So, he realized that he was a drunkard. This way, I gained a lot of experience in Delhi. Also, there were a few ignorant women like me, so we were sitting and discussing religion, and everyone was watching. Not many, but mostly everyone, such things happen. The girls who used to study with us in college, so straightforward, living with such simplicity and innocent, how do they suddenly become so arrogant? Then everything becomes like it's my home. Once, if they lost their napkin, they would call the whole universe, "Bhai! Did you accidentally take my napkin?" Oh Bhai, if it's gone, it's gone, maybe get it lost. If someone loses a spoon, they would call the whole world and say, "Bhai! I've lost a spoon from my place, someone took it." There's no shame in anything to them, such shamelessness to talk about such stinginess, and on top of it, you apply lipstick, makeup yourself, adorn yourself; but from the inside, you are so petty, of such small nature. How much importance will they give to those who get so bothered by small things time and again? Sometimes it's surprising how these people elevate themselves so much over trivial matters and yet are so low and mean. They can’t leave anything with any one, howsoever small it may be; if something remains with someone, it's as if their life is being drained; they are those who take everything with them. In Shivtattwa, when we contemplate impermanence, those worldly things that seem so insignificant to us become momentary and fleeting. They hold no grandeur. It's the love hidden behind or the consciousness within them that matters. As I told you, when I went to Kashmir, I felt vibrations five miles away; I told the driver, "Let's go there, let's go from there," but he said, "There's nothing there." I said, "No, there is something, there must be something." When we went and looked, many Muslims were collecting  money, when asked, "What's going on here?" They said, "Here, there's a strand of hair from Hazrat Iqbal, what will my descendants do with it?" One hair, Hazrat Iqbal, who was he, believe it or not, he was Prophet Muhammad, one hair kept there, and I caught it from five miles away. These are vibrations; imagine the power in a single hair. Similarly, this ashram of yours; in it, the soil, stones, cement, whatever is there, is not ordinary; it holds the significance of my children who lovingly built it with their hard work. By vibrating everything; if people don't find my photo, they can still sit outside and absorb the vibration, if people don't find my photo.  That's why it depends on you, that when you come inside it, remember, you are coming to awaken your consciousness, to attain Shivtatva, to awaken it. The man in whom there is Shivtatva, he is always joyful, laughing, playing. Those who are serious, they need to slap themselves twice every day. Because when I see it, I feel like giving two slaps. When Shivtatva has awakened within you, why do you make such an ominous face? And from the morning, forgive, forgive, forgive; forgive from the morning. I said, look, don't say it again, and forgive; otherwise, I'll slap you. Because the thing is that we have attained Shivtatva, and waves of joy are rising within us. How can we be serious; is there any mourning happening in our homes that someone has died? And this is also a disease prevalent in North India; especially when men are with their wives, just watch, they make such a face as if they are going to the crematorium. I have never seen men from here talking and laughing with women. Most people say that in our UP folks, the husband walks ahead and the wife walks ten steps behind, taking off her veil. Poor thing keeps looking to see where her husband is going; she keeps following him for that. And men are supposed to talk to women. Go sit in a hotel, sit in a restaurant; if you see any man talking a lot to a woman there, you should understand that she is not his wife, impossible. Because when talking to the wife, one knows not if they  got stung by a scorpion, and this is such a common experience I've seen, where the husband doesn't even talk to his wife when she's at home, nor does he ever take her out. And Shiv and Parvati, they both live in an unbreakable relationship, like the unbreakable relationship between the moon and the moonlight ‘Chandra & Chandrika’. Their relationship can never work with anyone else, and happiness cannot be attained because Shiv and his Shakti are together, and this way they do, what they want.  Their relationship is so sweet, and the way they give and receive, and the way there is joy; so let the man keep laughing and playing, and let the woman keep laughing and playing too. And let there be great love and joy between them. It should be said, this is the essence of Shiva and Parvati. Shiva has his own way, and Parvati has her own; Shiva doesn't say become like me, and Parvati doesn't say become like me; no coercion, just a kind of mutual understanding, affection, and what we call love, mutual respect, and playfulness. From Shivtatva, we also understand that the marriages within us can be completely happy only when both the man and the woman attain their own happiness. As long as the woman thinks about how much control I should have over the man and the man thinks about how much control I should have over my woman, understand that in that moment, this joy comes to an end. And such foolishness is when everything is laid out in front of us, all the happiness is completely filled for us, and we remain untouched by it. It's great when there's harmony among partners, but even in our household life, there should be such harmony. Neither should a woman dominate a man nor should a man dominate a woman; everyone should stay in their own place happily. Therefore, you also need to see here that women sometimes get annoyed with men for this reason. I have seen that their husbands remain very busy with work. If the Shiv element is awakened within you, if there is Shivtatva in your heart, then happiness comes only from this Shiv element.   And if you want to find happiness with your husband, you can achieve joy through him, you can nurture your ego through him, but it’s not that you get happiness with your husband, it’s your own Shivtatva that’s the source of joy, and you can find it through it only. So, what is there to be sad about if he has to work, has to strive?  If we tell you about our life, you won't even believe that for so many years we have been in India, our husband didn't take a single day off in life, not even for a single day; and that too only once in life, when Maulana Azad died one day, and everything came to a halt, but even then I didn't complain. So me, I am in my happiness, why should I bother? They are doing good work, working for the country, working hard, so let them work; and because of their work, how am I not benefiting? So, what's the point of bothering them repeatedly?  And what is the benefit of causing them trouble? They shouldn't be troubled when they have their own problems; they should be given rest, they should be cared for. These things are not possible here, which is why joy diminishes. Women spend the day resting and in the evening, they want the man to entertain them until midnight. You cannot be joyful all night if your soul is not awakened. If your soul awakens, you don't need it. Both of us have never gone anywhere alone. You will be surprised, but I don't lack anything; I am content. Neither do I lack anything, nor do they. If it is understood that we can only attain happiness through our soul and the joy we seek is our own. As long as you want to live in joy, stay in it. I didn't do this, I didn't do that, nor did that way; Saying by either of us agree, is the cause of sorrow. Today, I'm telling you that a person should come into existence without any attachment, without any, absolutely, nothing stopping them, where there is no desire for anything, the wish for anything doesn't suppress them. Then it should be termed Sahaja yogi friendship, and then it has become Sahaja yoga. Where it's not about fulfilling any desire, if this thing didn't happen, let's try another thing, not this thing, let's try another thing; the one who remains so cheerful should be called a Sahaja yogi. And it is hoped that in this city of Delhi, people are and will be ready for such things because now our ashram has been established, and today on this auspicious occasion, we have attained the essence of Shivtatva, which is joyful, which, upon seeing, makes you think, "Yes, sir, there is joy." And the waves of joy that spread among each other, seeing how happy everyone is towards me, sitting with so much love, and enjoying each other's company. So when I see the friendships among you people, it feels like this Delhi, wherein there used to be cut throat competition, pulling down someone, pulling someone back, doing this to someone, putting one person down and raising another, in that place, the atmosphere of friendship is so pure; friendship for the sake of friendship, love for the sake of love, if it becomes like this, then I would say that all my hard work in building the ashram has borne fruit for me.

Hope that today you establish your Shivatattwa. (As per original audio)
