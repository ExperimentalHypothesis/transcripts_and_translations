Public Program Day 2

[NOTE - 26.53-lectures starts followed by bhajan]

Yesterday I told you that we cannot know the truth at our human awareness. You have to become the spirit. You become the spirit. You are in contact with the all pervading power of love. And then only you can know the absolute truth. This is the power of God’s love. We have not used the power of love before. We have only used the power of hatred. Now there are so many seekers of truth in this world. In the beginning in the ancient times there were very few. Once you all get your self realization this energy of power of lover will start flowing through you. It will nourish you, it will cure you and take you beyond all mental ideas about reality. This power is within you which is called as kundalini in triangular bone. It is in the sacrum bone that means the Greeks knew that it is sacred bone. This power all of you have got. It is the germinating power within us. And when it is awakened it passes through six subtle centres and pierces through your fontanelle bone area. Though the seed of the spirit is fontanelle bone area, spirit itself resides in your heart. All this mechanism is within you. You are already built in that way. Like a small seed, all the maps of all the trees, you have this power within you. Though it is a living process, process of evolution; as you have become human being you have to become spirit spontaneously. Sahaja , saha means with , ja is born. Yoga means the union with this all pervading divine power. So every human being has a right to become united with this all pervading power. Hatha yoga, they have asked this question; ha – tha are two nadis, two side nadis. Ha is the sun line (right) and tha is the moon line (left). That means you have to deal with the psyche as well as you somatic side. Somatic right side. And the book of patanjali is so thick like that, so much, but what today they are teaching you are these exercises which is very v-bit, v-bit of that eight fold patanjali yoga. Also it is also indiscriminate. Because we also use the exercises whenever it is needed, whatever chakras whatever centres it is needed. But if you just do all these exercises you can become a very dry person. What we call that you become a right sided person. Such a person is very extremely irritable and hot tempered. So it is an some sort of artificial yoga. One has to be very careful. We got three patients who suffered because of hatha yoga. Then there is kriya yoga, all these yoga also artificial. Sahaja yoga is a-kriyayoga means nothing is to be done spontaneous. Automatically all the instruments starts working it out. You don’t have to do it from outside, artificially. In Los Angeles they the cut the thread of the tongue of the people to push the tongue back to raise the kundalini, which is nonsense. In ancient times they used to clean the centres for many lives also. From one life to another. Now I have discovered a new method in 1970. Where only few threads of kundalini rise piercing through, and pierce through your fontanelle bone area which and then you get slightly connected. But so many get in a big way. In that little light you can say whats wrong with you. For eg. you are holding on to a snake in the darkness and if I tell you that its a snake you may not agree with me. But if there is little light you will immediately see and throw away. Thats what happens to you when your kundalini rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area. I have seen people giving up drugs, smoking, alcohol overnight. Now when the kundalini rises she nourishes all the centres. Because of that you get cured of all the physical problem. And also you get rid of your mental problems. It enlightens your brain. You become extremely intelligent and also very dynamic. It enlightens your heart so you become extremely compassionate. And you get empowered that you can raise the kundalini of others and give realisation to others. Somebody has asked me how to protect the psychologist from getting caught up from their patients. In sahaja yoga you learn how to protect yourself. First you become thoughtlessly aware. When the kundalini crosses this centre. Then when it is established you become what we call as doubtlessly aware. At this stage you can give realisaton to others. And you become absolutely self confident. Also you feel this cool breeze of the all pervading power all the time. And you are surprised how you are looked after by this power. Life becomes full of miracles. They have asked me about christianity and Christ. I believe in christ of course and without him we cannot give you realisation. We will tell you where christ resides within us. But I do not believe in christianity. Not because christianity came to India with a gun in one hand and bible in another hand. They went to America and killed all the people who were there. Even in Argentina and chile you cannot find one aboriginal. Thank God Columbus did not come to India , by chance he went there. Otherwise I would not have been here. All this christians (missionaries) would have killed us completely. It is all money oriented organisaton. And the power oriented. It is not spirit oriented. Christ has said that you will be calling me christ christ I wouldn't recognise you. And these people are the christians . Because they are not following christ, they are following Paul. Paul was not anyway near christ. I was born in a christian family myself. I asked my father in my childhood who is this Paul. My father was a realised soul. He told me this one has just come very nicely and settled down. He killed so many christians, he killed also St. Steven. And he found that it was good platform to get a name so he just became a great leader. And he was a epileptic that means he was possessed, collecting money. Christ has said that you have to be born again. But they take false certificate that we are born again. By saying we are born again you do not become. You have to have selfrealisation. By giving false baptism you do not become a christian. You have to have an actualisation of realisation, actualisation of baptism. That is why christ has also said that those who are not against me are with me. We should find out who are those. But in christian religion they put blinkers, you can't see here or there. Also they frighten you and say that you are sinners and you must pay for it. But God does not know money. Christ has died for our sins. He has already suffered for us. What more can we suffer. But they want to show christ as a person hanging on the cross all the time, show him so miserable. But if you see the sixteen chapel where Michael Angelo, was realised soul, he showed christ as a large personality with a big stomach and all. All that sixteen chapel is this todays what you call the last judgement. The message of christ is resurrection. And not suffering. We have christ on our Agnya chakra on the optic chiasma where the two nerves cross to go to two eyes. Christ has said though shall not have adulterous eyes. How many christians there are who have no lust or greed in their eyes. Christ is the eternal child of innocence. They had the father God and the son God, but no mother. In the christianity they have avoided the women completely. In all other scriptures, other religion they accept the primordial mother. Even the mother of christ was a goddess. She is the one who gave realisation to this twelve disciples of christ, eleven disciple. But they do not want to talk about it. They don't even allow women to be the priest. But its not true. This centre if you have to open you have to forgive. What christ has given us is the greates weapon , to forgive everyone. Even when on the cross he said, he said that all those who were crucifying him should be forgiven, he prayed to God. So those people, who are following, supposed to be following are not only forgiving but they are so aggressive, they are so horrid. they are so immoral. Christ went to a wedding and made the water into wine. It was the grape juice, not the alcohol. One can do it even with vibrations. But how can it be alcohol because alcohol has to rot for one month. Otherwise it doesn't become alcohol. So all false idea has been generated. Without connection to christ no use praying to him. They are distributing bible, they are distributing geeta, all this books; by having this bookish knowledge are we going to rise higher. It is the prescription given to you. If you are go on reading the prescription, you will get more headache. You have to take the medicine, you have to get your realisation. Without christ we cannot do sahaja yoga but all the prophets, and all the incarnation play a part. They are all within ourselves. Today a muslim lady came. She had a pain in the stomach and her kundalini would not rise. She told that she was muslim. So I asked her to ask muhammad sahab if this is the resurrection time he was telling about. She asked thrice and her kundalini rose and she felt alright. Because muhammad sahab has said when resurrection time will come your hands will speak. That happens in sahaja yoga. But what are the muslims doing, just fighting with each other, cutting everybody's throat. Same with hindu. It is said that in everybody resides the spirit. So how can you have caste system. In every religion whether it is buddhism, jainism, sikhism; all are isms. You ask a jew and he will tell against the christian. And will tell against the muslims. And muslims will tell against the jews. All of them are blind and ignorant. There are no where near God. Now we have 40 nations doing sahaja yoga. And all of them belong to all religion. The jews, hindus, muslims all respect christ. They also worship muhammad and they also worship shri krishna. Because they are all born on the same tree of spirituality. But people like Paul have taken away the flowers, plucked them and now they are fighting with the dead flower. Sahaja yogis are universally are in a pure religion. It is an innate religion. You become automatically righteous and compassionate. Yesterday many people got their realisation. Some did not get perhaps their physical mental problems. But today I hope all of you will get your realisation. And as honest people you must take to reality and not to nonsense. You have to respect your realisation. And you have to grow in collectivity. It is the growth only in collectivity not individually. If somebody says I can do it at home, he cannot. Because you become part and parcel of the whole. The microcosm becomes macrocosm. Now supposing if I cut my nail it will never grow. I had told you that I will tell you about the spirit. Spirit is the collective being within us. It is the reflection of God almighty in our heart. And kundalini is the reflection of the primordial mother, the holy ghost. Which is the pure desire. The spirit is source of peace. It is the source of absolute knowledge. When it starts manifesting on central nervous system, you feel cool breeze. You become like a divine computer. And then you can feel it about everyone, their chakras and yours too. If you know how to correct them, you can cure others, you can cure yourself. You can find about anyone of anything with your vibrations. Your attention becomes enlightened with the light of spirit, your eyes becomes innocent, and wherever you pay attention this attention acts for the benevolence. Spirit gives us total balance and total benevolence. It is the source of joy. And when joy is manifesting there is no duality of happiness and unhappiness. I hope Bulgaria will become a very powerful spiritual country. They have asked me about asthma and all these diseases are absolutely curable, even caner. But you have to come to the centre. The best is to get your self realisation established. So there is no more diseases for you. And you can cure others. No use curing one disease like that. I am sorry I have to go today by plane to Turkey. But I will give you your realisation. I will come next year now. I travel a lot. I am always with you. So you should have no more fear, no more depression, nothing can torture you, trouble you or dominate you.

So now we will have self-realisation meditation.

I have already told you that I cannot force self-realisation on you. It has to be accepted, asked for, desired for in your glory of freedom. I would request you to take out your shoes. You will have all the knowledge about sahaja yoga absolutely free in your centre. Today we have here some English, some French, some Italians who come to help you; and also Greek. But specially the Swiss. They have taken a great interest in you and they will be coming off and on. Now we have to know that we have two powers, one is the power of desire or ordinary desire and another is the power of action. So now please put your left hand towards me and both the feet apart from each other because these are two powers. And we have to use the right hand for nourishing our centres on the left hand side which he will show you. Now there are two conditions which you will have to fulfill. The first condition is that you have to forget the past means that you should know that you are not guilty not at all. Those who tell you you are sinners are themselves sinners. After all you are human being. Human beings can only make mistakes. You are not Gods. So please don't feel guilty at all. On the contrary you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourselves. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do any thing. But if you do not forgive then you play in the wrong hands and torture yourself for nothing at all. And those whom you do not forgive are enjoying life. If you do not forgive the centre here is closed like this. But if you forgive it will open like that and then kundalini can go. If you feel guilty then this centre catches here, between the shoulder and the neck, here, on this side and kundalini cannot pass through. But you get diseases like spondylitis, angina. While forgiving you do not have to think of individual, in general you have to say I forgive everyone. Don't fight with your thoughts. You will automatically become thoughtlessly aware. So now we will first tell you how you nourish your centre and then we raise the kundalini. Those who are sitting on the chair have to put both the feet apart from each other. And those who are sitting on the ground are alright as they are. They should sit in very, we say sahaja asana means absolutely spread out; with folded leg if possible for a short time. Now, please put the left hand towards me like this. You can keep it on your lap. Now, this symbolises that you want your self-realisation. Now you put your right hand on your heart where resides the spirit. Now you put your hand on the upper portion of the abdomen. This is the centre of your mastery. This is created by all prophets and all the great masters. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. This is the centre of pure knowledge which manifests on your central nervous system. All whatever we get out of evolutionary process manifest on central nervous system. Now we raise our hand again on the upper portion of the abdomen. Then raise your hand on your heart. Now you have to take your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head toward right. Now take your hand on tope of your forehead and put your small finger and thumb on two temples. And now hold your head properly with three fingers and put it down, put it down. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone. Now you have to take your hand back side of your head. And push back your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to ask forgiveness from the all pervading power of love; without feeling guilty, without counting your mistake for your own satisfaction. Now stretch your palm fully. Put the centre of the palm on top of your fontanelle bone are. Now press it hard by pushing your fingers outward. Please put down your head. And now move your scalp. Please press it hard press it hard . Push back your finger. Now move your scalp slowly seven times clock wise. Put down your head. Its better. Now sit comfortably. Neither bending nor too much stretching, but in a straight manner. Now put the left hand towards me on your lap. And close your eyes, take out your spectacles. Till I tell you please do not open your eyes. Now please put your right hand on your heart. Here you have to ask me a fundamental question. You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji. And you have to ask three times. “Mother am I the spirit”; If you are the spirit you are the light and you are the guide. So you become your own master. Now please take your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen. Now here you have to say, three times; “Mother am I my own master”. Now I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it in your freedom. So now please put your left hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and ask me six times because this centre has got six petals; “Mother please give me pure knowledge”. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen and to open this centre please say ten times “Mother I am my own master”. You should know that you are not this body. You are not this mind. You are not this ego or conditioning. But you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence “Mother I am the spirit”, say it twelve times. Now you have to know that all pervading power of love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you commit, this power of forgiveness can dissolve it. So now raise your hand in corner of your neck and shoulder and put your head toward right. Here you say with full confidence sixteen times “Mother I am not guilty at all”. I have already told you that you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive you play into wrong hand. So now please place your right hand on top of your forehead and hold your temples with your finger and with your thumb. Now please put down your head. Here you have to say with full confidence “Mother I forgive everyone”. From your heart you have to say not how many times. Now please put your hand on back side of your head and put your head backward. Here you have to say “Oh divine power please forgive me if I have done anything wrong”. Now spread your palm and put the centre of palm on top of your head. And now start moving your scalp seven times saying “Mother give me my self realisation”. Now take down your hand. Now please put your left hand towards me and also right hand. Now bend your head and see if there is cool breeze coming out of your head. Now put the left hand towards me and see with the right hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now put your right hand towards me and see if there is a cool breeze. Already there is so much breeze has already has started to stop the rain. Put your hand up like this and ask the question “is this the cool breeze of the holy ghost” and three times ask this question. Now you will feel some coolness on your hand. Now please put down your hands. All those who have felt the relaxation and cool breeze from their head or on their hands, please raise raise your hands. Raise both your hands. Now wonder this breeze is blowing because it was so hot. It was very hot when I came here and now it has become very nice. Now please look after your self-realisation. I am sorry I have to go because I have to catch the plane.
