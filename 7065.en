Conversation in Courtyard, The End of Miracles (afternoon)

Shri Mataji: ... shop, little shop, to get these trinkets and he gave exactly the same amount as was needed. So many things are reported now, I mean, I've got letters and letters like that. So I'll have to look into them also for you.

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, one that You may not know because it's quite recent. The United States, you know Andrea, she has a little girl? The other day, You were in her room and You had a red, I asked, "what is the color of the sari?" and You had a red sari. And so she was quite, kind of, impressed, and then the picture told her it's all right. Your picture told her it's all right that You are sitting in her room. So she ran away, I mean after some time. She doesn't want to speak so much about it to us, but for three days she was talking to her parents and so on and so forth. She went in Mami's room to tell her all about the story that Shri Mataji is here in her room. Come, come. And then you were gone.

Shri Mataji: So where was I?

Gregoire: In her room.

Shri Mataji: In her room?

Gregoire: Yes. Sitting down.

Shri Mataji: She saw Me?

Gregoire: Yes, she saw You.

Shri Mataji: So, you asked Me on the phone or what, what sari I'm wearing?

Gregoire: No, I asked her. I just asked her what was the color of Shri Mataji's sari and she told me it was red. I asked the girl.

Shri Mataji: Then how do you verify it?

Gregoire: Yes, that's a good question. I wanted to ask you about that. That's why I'm quite happy to tell you this story, so you can give me a clue.

Shri Mataji: You have to make it feasible. What you have to say, "That I telephoned to ask Mother, what color sari are You wearing? And You said it is red." Then it is feasible. But otherwise it is not.

Gregoire: Otherwise it looks a bit [??].

Shri Mataji: Yes, it could be her imagination. But, it's happened this time, a very good thing, a miracle that we went out [asking someone in Hindi to speak].

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, twice it happened. Once, in Calcutta, Shri Mataji was boarding the flight from Patna to go for the Calcutta Puja to tell them that they had arranged everything, and so I picked up the newspaper and it. Oh, that also, now before we left for Calcutta, another miracle in Patna. At night we went for a drive after the public program to the Ganges river.

Shri Mataji: The Ganges river. It was a full moon night.

Sahaja Yogi: And it was a full moon night. There was a long bridge across there, a new bridge, and so we stopped the car halfway through and took a walk. And, She came and stood next to the railing over the river and the moon was shining there, just under Her feet. I mean there was a ray of light, just like that.

Shri Mataji: Sure, it has happened also like that.

Sahaja Yogi: And the current in the river was flowing from under Her feet only. So, to verify it, Shri Mataji said, "I'll walk ahead another 100 yards and you watch what happens." So [names of two Yogi's ] stood at that place and then we carried on. Then I walked ahead with Her and I shouted, I said, "what's it like there now?" They said, "it's pitch dark and there is nothing flowing!" And while She walked, the moon walked with Her, sort of, over the water.

Shri Mataji: The reflection.

Sahaja Yogi: The reflection, the shine, and the current just shifted in the river and started flowing to where She was. So, then we sat in the car and drove to the edge of the river and it kept going right till the edge. And then when the river was over and we came over the land, again, the moon was still following. So, it kept moving until we went home and it was there.

Shri Mataji: There was no reflection any more.

Sahaja Yogi: And the river was dark when we left the river, it was completely dark. Just, the moonlight wouldn't reflect on the river.

Shri Mataji: We have to get there, but Warren was talking that thing.

Sahaja Yogi: So we verified it.

Shri Mataji: So, we have to go, have got program. And I hope you will be all there for our program.

[Public Program Starts]

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. We can see the result of Self-Realization in the music of these people here. They never knew music, and Indian music is very difficult to sing. But, Self-Realization gives you such a rapport with the Divine that it works in such a miraculous manner that people become just dynamic. They are not musicians, they are engineers, doctors, architects, business men. All this kind of thing they have been doing and they are doing this too, now. But when you become the Self, as I told you yesterday, when you become the Spirit, then you become a universal being. Become means that on your central nervous system you can feel that you are part and parcel of the whole. You can feel it, it is not only mental, a sermon. It's not mental acceptance, but actually, it is a new awareness. As I told you yesterday, that everything that we know about all theories and all kinds of faiths, religion, everything is mental. Because it is mental, we can use the way we like. So there is no compulsion on us. As we have our Spirit, when it shines in our attention, then in that light we really become righteous automatically. For example, we have seen the saints, the incarnations, prophets, they would not be tempted to do anything that was sinful. Whatever they did was for the benevolence of others.

So, we have three types of people, as I would say. The one type, which thinks no end of oneself and lives with its own vanity. For such a person there's nothing like unhappiness, till he falls like a Humpty Dumpty. And another type is all the time complaining about one's health. This is wrong with me, my husband is bad, my wife is bad, my children are bad, everyone is bad. So the first type makes others miserable and the second type makes oneself miserable. They cannot see anyone happy, nor will they make anyone happy. But there's a third type of people who are bothered about everybody else but themselves. These are the special categories, whom I call as seekers, and when such seekers are seeking the truth, they also fall a prey to some sort of a show, or some sort of a pressure.

As I told you yesterday, that it's a living process, when the Kundalini rises and gives you your Realization. And that is what every one of you has to achieve and has a right to achieve. Now, we have all kinds of misleading people also, as we saw yesterday, there were so many who have been to wrong gurus, wrong, false gurus and who came to Me. And I'm sorry most of them were Indian, I'm sorry. But one must know, what do you want? How can you pay for your Realization? But somehow or other, people get so much mesmerized and believe it. That once when I had come here first I had met the Queen of Spain, and she told Me that there's one guru who has come from India who says he's fourteen years of age and he has ruined 50,000 young boys. All this is there is like that. All those who are really the seekers of truth will find it because it is their right to find it.

First and foremost thing, you must see the disciples of such a guru, how are they. Have they got any knowledge? Can they give Realization? Can they talk about what they have got it? Can they work out their benevolence? Are they righteous people? Are they joyous people? Do they have the same problems as normal people have, like racialism and other nonsensical things? Such people have to be large-hearted and they have to be truthful. And they'll stand for anything that is injustice, against. Like Christ Himself, when He saw Mary Magdalene being stoned, stood up. And He said that, "Those who have not committed any sin can throw the stone at Me." This is the courage and the strength of truth and this truth is compassion, is love.

It is all within you and you have to just reach there somehow. You have to respect yourself. And you have to know that there is a meaning to your life, which is not for just wasting it like everybody else does. Life is not just for collecting money, making insurances and then dying. All their lives they cry and when they die others cry for them. So what's the use, this kind of a crying society, while God Almighty has created this beautiful universe and has created human beings at the epitome of evolution? And He wants you to enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy the blessings. This is what it is you have to get through your Self-Realization.

Already you have been told about Kundalini awakening, the chakras and all those things, that's not so important. Unless and until you get your Realization and settle with it you are as Spanish as anybody else is. Nothing so special about it. So first, after getting Realization, you must sit down and settle with it and get your connection absolutely fixed properly. So all the time, this Divine Power is flowing through your hands and through your fontanel bone area. I don't know how many speeches I have given in English language, it has been thousands, and in other languages also. There's no end of this. And I told you that first you must have the experience. No use talking about it.

So, should we now have our Self-Realization? Yesterday we had allowed you to ask some questions, you can ask today also, but not too many please. By asking questions, or by getting answers, you are not going to get your Realization. Of course there is no guarantee, but most of you can get it. But you must have desire, pure desire. Nobody can force you into the Kingdom of God. And please do not try to judge yourself. You all are capable and worthy of getting Self-Realization. May God bless you all!

I could have questions and then we could answer them.

Question: He doesn't know if he can get cured again.

Shri Mataji: Hundred percent. He went to a very wrong person though.

Question: He wants to give You a present.

Shri Mataji: Present, to Me? First you get cured.

Question: He says he wrote it himself and it's a souvenir from Barcelona.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much, thank you.

Question: She says if you desire for other people to get Realization, will it help for them to get Realization? If we desire. If she desires.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, your desire has got to be pure. Why not? He got the Realization yesterday anyway.

Question: He says that in the scriptures they always talk about the relationship between devotee and master or guru. How can you manage at distance, come closer, when You are sitting before him.

Shri Mataji: You see, it is in the heart you feel it. I can feel you, all of you in My heart. We have to open our hearts. I think while singing only, most of you got your Realization. I feel that way, let's see, put your hands like this. Just close your eyes. Towards Me. You'll feel a cool breeze in your hands. All right?

Now, you feel it on your head, from the top of your head, just put your hand towards Me. Ha, see, si? No come up here and I'll see you. See now how your desire that others should get it is working out? Now, the desire should be that we should all be settled, we should be all settled in Sahaja Yoga. We should be all masters, as they are, and these people are.

May God bless you all! Those who have not felt can come and see Me but those who have felt first come and see Me. And those who have not felt can go at the back and they can see them.
