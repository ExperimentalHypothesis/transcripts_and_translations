Shri Buddha puja. Brighton (UK), 26 May 1983.

This time in there was no rain; we went to the sea in Melbourne. I told it will be great we go to Melbourne and we went to the sea and I made a Ganesha and they made a Shiva there and they worshipped the …so and they made a Kundalini also there.
And see then they prayed, and it rained and rained and rained. It poured you know, poured in buckets, poured in buckets. It was, I have never seen such rain before like buckets were pouring. And in one day 4 inches of rain in that Sydney, can you believe it! And the puja was on inside and outside on my birthday buckets and buckets of water. It was a drought you know, they were so frightened.
Sahaja Yogi: We heard that the whole tent fell, Mother… [Mother: laughing]
Sahaja Yogi: … because of so much rain, Robert was telling us, Mother.
Mother: And you see the sahaja yogis enjoyed it so much, you see, they… how they have played a trick. And then the river got flooded and it entered into all the pubs and all such, and washed off everything you know, brought it you see. As it went inside washed off the bottles and everything, and all the bottles - some of the empty ones - you see, were floating, these plastic ones were floating and others sank down everything was washed up and was brought in. But only into the pubs they entered. So in the newspaper was said that the rain was tremendous but the river was very discreet. And also this fire that broke out before I went to Adelaide. Adelaide had a very bad fire and what they described it was this (can you put it there this one… on top of that like that) and they described that the fire was also very discreet and the balls of fire they saw rising on the hills and entering to some houses, avoiding some houses. Some houses were completely burnt and some were not. And those people who did not suffer came to my program, said now we know why we were saved out of that.
And they could see the balls can you imagine, the balls of fire from somewhere, I mean, they don’t know how the balls were formed. a Big big balls like these, you see, were just rolling up the hill. And they could see – you see – balls rolling up the hill and going up, entering into the houses like that. They just could not understand what happened with the fire? But the best was the washing of the pubs because normally on the river side they have all these pubs you see (laughing) and they washed off all these what you call things used for, these tanning things. See they have those mattresses, sun mattresses and all that. All everything was washed and brought inside (laughing). I really enjoyed it very much and sahaja yogis were so happy with all that, very happy.
(Sy: Jai!)
They asked me a question, why God is angry with us you see here in Adelaide. And Adelaide is just like Paris for Australia, just like Paris. Very promiscuous, all kinds of dirty things happen there, all sorts of horrid things take place there. So like Soho it is, you see. So it was Adelaide was chosen by fire – just burnt them off. 
When I went to see the hills where it started, all black, all black hills, nothing was there, nothing. No leaf, not a single leaf. And it was really surprising: this house was burnt, that was not burnt, this house was burnt, that was not burnt. You could see it so clearly. And when it was burnt, it was burnt completely. I don’t know how they burnt even the bricks and everything, absolutely charred black.
It’s very interesting the way sometimes the nature takes its respite. Like when I went once to Guntur, you see, I told these people that you shouldn’t grow any tobacco there anymore. They were exporting all that tobacco to England, can you imagine! And they had, in the house you could find all English tiles and English… what you call, these old style big showers, you see such big big showers you see, (?) stand then the whole thing gets absolutely, like a torrential rain falls on you. All English. And tubs they had, English tubs, everything, in the house. Exporting that tobacco here, you see. 
So I said, ”You shouldn’t do that, you should not have done it”. So they said, ”But you know Mother, we are giving it to English, not to Indians”. I said, ”Still you should not have done it. It’s a wrong thing. (Aside to a yogi: Gavin, you are doing the same mistake as I have done, I think. Alright, it’s correct. It’s correct. You are…)
So then what happened that I told, just I told them, if you grow like this it’s not good. And whether they are English or Indians you are committing sins. You should not do like that, why you are growing this. I said you can grow very good what you call cotton here, like just like Egyptian cotton you can grow here, why do you want to do.
Some people took me seriously and some of them got very angry. When I had gone there about 50 cars came to receive me, but when I was going, hardly two or three people came to see me because they were angry for it. I said now, I warned them that if you go about like this the sea is just next door and it will take a respite. It is going to be angry with you, listen to me. And they were so angry with me they didn’t come to see me off or anything because I told them.
Now what happens that, that same year there was a typhoon which entered into them which has never entered there. And all that was devastated. All their crops were devastated. They can no more grow, no more grow tobacco there. And in the meanwhile the government of U.K stopped the import of tobacco from that place. So it was doubly hit you see, doubly hit. But those who started growing the cotton were perfectly alright. Because all the salty water went into the soil and now they can’t grow this thing. And they said they never had this kind of an experience. After that they came to Delhi and asked Me, “Mother, You must again come, we are sorry for what we have done.”
And I said: “No, I didn’t do anything, to be very frank. I’d never thought of any destruction. But you brought it as I told you that the sea will get angry. But they said, “It happened so quickly, Mother (laughs)”. I said not so quick because at least there were eight months for you to change your ways. Imagine! Just to export this tobacco’s to you and get those tubs there.
You know, they have a kind of a inferiority complex, that if they live like English having tubs and things like that, then they become something higher personality. But for that to sell tobacco to you, just imagine. It’s all showing up now, you will see that. Everything that I am saying will be showing up. 
I was happy to learn that there has been a program about these horrible diseases which are caused by this promiscuous life and all that. I am very happy. Let people learn now. They used to make fun of Me and say that I am Victorian, this, that. Now let them learn what it means. Now everybody is quite alert. In… You were telling Me, I think she told me that in England there are ten thousand people who are suffering from this disease, can you believe it. Ten thousand people. And they used to call me Victorian.
(Shri Mataji talking to sahaja yogis:) Gavin has arrived? Where? Just I say that hundred years life is, come along. You are also giving a puja thing, you know, here. You can take that paper out. Now I think we should spread some other cloths here, some sort of a old towel or something or put one of the towel there, so that this portion is kept clean (sahaja yogi: “There’s some water for you”, Shri Mataji: “Thank you”.). I didn’t give you a silver thaali Gavin, isn’t it? I must have given it to some other center, I don’t know. From that same shop where they were giving, you see, 100 percent silver I bought silver for the puja. [...]
So all of them are here. Has Jane came? Has she arrived? No. Where is she?
[Yogi: She’s still outside]
Alright. Call all of them inside. You can move forward a little bit I think, but why not spread here something just to…
[sahaja yogi says: “She’s just coming, Mother”].
Did you see those lines, energy lines, eh? Just imagine. Eh?
Zodiac lines? These are energy lines making the zodiac? [Yogi: Yes] I did not know that, I thought... [Shri Mataji keeps talking to the yogi]
So what are the zodiacs signs? Which ones are there?
[Yogi: All of the twelve signs]
All twelve are there, in a circle?
[Yogi: Yes]
And you discovered these by a magnet?
[Yogi: I think we’ve found a lot of it by dowsing].
By dowsing.
[Yogi: Yes. Just with the…]
With that? Or they find it by magnet.
[Yogi: Or they find it also by tracing the old lines of the boundaries…].
Boundaries of what?
[Yogi: Waterways and… the boundaries between the…] 
But actually you see, if you take a magnet yeah? It will dip at the point you see? So if you follow that dipping then it forms a line. That’s the best scientific method.
Dowsing also the same thing is, it’s what is the magnet, you see. And the magnet when it [makes gesture as a magnet being attracted towards the earth].
You see at certain points the magnetic lines are strong - that’s magnetism is the essence of the mother earth in expression. I mean the fragrance is, but the fragrance has the magnet, the fragrance comes out of magnet.
Now, this magnetism of the mother earth goes in lines, you see, it doesn’t move in... only at the fragrant point it moves all over. But otherwise it acts in lines. And these lines you can find out easily if you use a magnet you see, a powerful magnet, move that magnet on the mother earth you see, you will find that it will start dipping down. You see, you move it and you will find out it’s not dipping there and then you move it that side in the line. It’s the easiest way because dowsing could be bhootish sometimes, could be.
Yogi: Yes.
But are you sure it is done with dowsing, or…
[Yogi: “I think it’s a combination of different things. The one who has written the book has been…”]
Using dowsing.
[Yogi: “Using dowsing as well as the magnet”.]
But dowsing can be challenged by science.
[Yogini: “The one in Glastonbury was also discovered by an aerial photograph”].
They photographed how?
[Yogi: “They can see the boundaries of the fields made a pattern, things like that”].
Fields!
[“Yes, it’s all the old boundaries between different…”]
Old ones.
[Yogi: “Yes”]
[Yogini: “Fields, and roads, and waterways”]
Unconscious must be building up that way. And the old people that lived were much more sensitive, much more reacting to unconscious.
[Yogi: “Yes”] Because they were not so artificial, but when we become artificial what happens, we get covered up with so many barriers, and we cannot, we are not sensitive to the dictates of the unconscious. And when you cannot feel the dictates of the unconscious, you see you start having again deliberations as I call it. Deliberations take you out you see, from that sensitivity.
But if you are natural and simple person then you are quite sensitive, very sensitive (you can move forward, I think you come forward now, just come forward, come forward. You can, come on, yes, you can come. Actually new people should be in front, those who are from Brighton. Would be better idea. Come forward. The Brighton people should come forward I would say, as much as… Gavin, you come this side, I think would be better. Because he has to… Now. Come along, sit down, sit down, sit.
You can keep it that side. Who else is there? Is somebody still outside? Nick, if you can… on the other side of Nick also some people can sit. It is a very nice sunny day today, isn’t it?.
Sahaja yogi asks Mother: Would like this window opened slightly, Mother?
Mother says: Which one? That’s ok. I think that one if you open will be better idea.
[Yogi: “It’s open, Mother”.]
Is open, it’s alright.
[Long pause]
Today is a great day to come to Brighton because is the day of Buddha’s birth, today is Buddha’s birthday, Lord Buddha’s birthday.
You all have heard about his birth and that his mother dreamt of an elephant, a large white elephant, before the birth of Buddha. And then it was predicted that a child will be born in your family, who will be either a great saint or a very great king.
As in Sanskrit called chakravarti means the one who is the ruler of whole world. So the father got worried and he thought he must get the son involved the into family life, into material life, and give him all the pleasures of life. So he built a very special place for him, beautiful palace to live in. And where he got him married to a girl called Yashodhara, was a very, very beautiful woman, gave him all the pleasures of life. Everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.
Also you know the story of his going one day on the road. How he found three types of people and how he felt that “why a person should become old? Why should person suffer in life? And why should people die?”
So all these three things put an enquiry into himself. And he started trying to understand why these things happen to human beings. With this the enquiry started. So he reached a point where he could not bear anymore the comforts and the - all the attachments that were entangled around him by his father.
He had a son whose name was Rahul and he left the son and the wife in the search of the truth. Now, he started from a wrong end I should say for the search of the truth, because he wanted to know why there are miseries in the human beings. And so he started from collective towards the center.
When we see miseries all around us, many people have seen; they say: “What about others? Will everybody get realization? Will everybody will have this?”, you see. This comes from the wrong end I feel, because first of all we must know: are we alright? Are we, are we perfect? Are we full of joy? Have we received the absolute knowledge?
If you start from this point is always better. Because he started from the wrong point, searching it from the collective to remove the miseries of the people, he had to go in a very roundabout way. So he read all the books, and Vedas and this. He went to big pundits, to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them, to ask them the answer: ”Why there are these three things, that is, the roga (sickness, disease) is the health or miserable physical body, then the death, and the old age. Went and asked so many people and they said: ”You have to die because you are born”. And then they said that “You have to become old because you are born like that. And you have to suffer because you commit sins”.
He was not satisfied with this answer. So he went on searching and searching and searching and then he got tired, absolutely fed up.
When he went to a place called Gaya, very near Patna it is, I have seen the place and the tree. And he sat under a Banyan tree where he slept off, because he got so tired of his seeking. And after the sleep he got up and suddenly he got his realization. And he thought: ”he whole drama is over”.
Now his mother herself was Adi Shakti, gave him the birth and She died just after the birth of the child. And he got His realization.
Now at that time, that he got his realization, there was nobody to tell him what it is (Mother smiles). That what it means, realization is. Nobody to decode or talk about anything that was to be understood by him. But because of his tremendous seeking and such ardent desire that the shuddha ichcha, the Kundalini itself, rose - but of course the Adi Shakti blessed him and he got his realization under the Banyan tree.
Now, any incarnation which came on this earth had to samayachar, according to the time, the need of the time had to act, firstly. Secondly, the need of the incarnation to come on this earth was first created in the human beings.
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism, Brahmanism or priesthood and people were trying to take everything onto those artificial rituals and all that, an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.
Like Krishna came at a time when he said: “This is all leela”, puja and everything he cancelled. He said nothing doing, no puja nothing. We just have raas, enjoy yourself. It’s all a joke going on, you see. So he brought that concept at that time in the awareness among the people that the whole world is a leela, is a play of God’s own whims. So you just enjoy it.
And that’s how he created this a wonderful festival of Holi which we had in Delhi. I don’t know anyone of you who was there for the Holi. No. you were there? (Smiles) [Yogi: “Two years back”]. No, but this time you were not there. Alright. You might get the pictures of that.
Alright. So, in the same way, when Buddha came in, first problem was that he thought that is better not to talk about God. Because in his search everybody told him the answer was “Oh! It is God who does it. He punishes you. It is God who gives you this old age. It is God who does it”. “But what is this God after all? Why does he do it?”. They said: “You better ask the God”. ”I mean, where is the God?”. So everybody put every blame on God as usual.
Even that’s done today, nothing so new, and nothing unusual I should say. So “this must be done by God”. If you cut your throat God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat. So you see he thought better not talk of God, because everybody is going towards God.
Then the people whom he met, they said: ”Now I have become God”, He said “How?”. He said, “I am God”. ”What, why?”. Because he could mesmerize people, he said “I have become God”. Just imagine. So he thought that it is very dangerous to talk of God because people take God in the hand and use it for their own purpose. Always say: ”Oh! This is what the God has to do. And it’s God has done it, and I am in connection with God and I will tell God”. So he got a fright and he said that: “Better not talk about God because that puts the attention of people on ritualism, artificial things, they are building temples after temples and just doing all these horrible things, which one should not do”.
Like, if you go to the south you will find in the temples, they shave their heads of the ladies. They shave it completely and they have to… it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall, the walls of the temple. And the ladies who shave their heads are just rolling along the sides you see, they have to do it sometimes 1008 times rolling, imagine. And the water is poured on them you see, God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come, you see. So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that, and somebody is pouring water on them all the time, buckets after buckets. Her husband and her brother and all they’re bringing one after another, you see, one is finished, then, other one… (gesture of pouring water). Poor ladies rolling like that, on that muddy sort of a cobbled area. I mean I was shocked when I saw this. I said: “What’s this?”. And then later on, you see, they became modern so they started selling the hair you see abroad, so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras you see. The hair was made into these bouffant and all that you call it, you see (laughs). And they sent to England and other places.
So, it’s, I mean in the name of God ridiculous things were done, ridiculous things were done. So he just thought better not talk about God, the first step is self-realization. He was a great Sahaja yogi I must say. Because He said nothing doing, don’t talk about God or anything, first you get your realization. That was the first condition. Establish it. Unless and until you have established your realization, nothing doing.
So he just started his own method of propagating buddhi… - Buddha’s knowledge or you can (say) Buddhism as they call it. Of course it became “ism” later on. 
So all that he started with the idea that people should first become buddha. Buddha means realized. Buddha is to know. So Buddha means the person who has known, means the one who is a realized soul. So what he says: “buddham sharanam gacchami”, I bow - no, I surrender: sharanam means surrender - I surrender to the buddhas, means to all the sahaja yogis. You all are buddhas, because you know. When you know, you are the Buddha. Now without going into all that nonsense of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress and everything, you have achieved your realization. It is a short circuit, or a short path. Why? Because he started from the other side. But if he had started directly from himself you see, it would have been better. You see, in practical sense I’ll tell you how it is. Supposing you want to repair your house, so you have to have instrument for that house. But supposing if you are worried about all the houses of the world and you start repairing, neither you’ll repair other houses nor yours. So first you must practice on yourself. Put your attention to yourself, you see. Is also is a method by which you avoid seeing the point, seeing the reality that if you are not alright, how can you improve the whole world.
So when your attention goes to other things, you must know that there is something wrong with you first of all, which must be corrected. And that’s why it took him so much time to go round and round and round. He had to give up his wife, give up his family, give up everything and get to realization. Because by giving up everything he realized that it is he who should achieve. It is a very circuitous way. But you can just say: ”Does not exist anything, first let me get alright” that’s sahaja.
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God. Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God. You must renounce the world then achieve God.
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth. How do you renounce the world? It is myth. What are you renouncing? I mean in any case you can’t carry this with you. Can you? I mean can you even carry I would say even a thread? Nothing. When you come you come like this you are born with closed fists, when you go the hands are like this, open.
Have you ever seen a dead corpse? He always has his hands like this, “nothing I’m taking”.
Just going like this. So you don’t take anything from here. So this renouncing, this “I renounce that, I renounce that”, “I’ll give up this, I’ll give up my wife, I’ll give up that”, has no meaning. Because it’s a state of mind in which your being becomes… I don’t know the English word for that, which doesn’t stick to something, what is it called? [A yogi says something]
No no no, you see any, any substance that does not stick to anything. Like we have all kinds of stick plastic.
[Yogi: “Unattached, unattached”]
No, but that quality. There’s a quality of the temperament which does not stick to anything. Does not stick to anything. I mean, you put it here it will come out. You can say the soap or something like that.
[Yogi: Like mercury, Mother].
Eh?
[Yogi: Like mercury, just flows].
Ah, like mercury. But mercury also you can apply sometimes with heat, but this is something beyond mercury. Is absolute, which does not stick to anything you see. We just become like that; or you do wear this, you wear that, you have this, alright; you never...
The name of the Goddess is Nirmama. Nirmama, that for Her nothing is her own, you see, she does not stick to anything. She is in everything but She doesn’t stick to anything. For example, now see the light here; it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself. Doesn’t stick to anything. This is the nearest you can say, does not stick to anything. Anything tries to stick it, you see, gets burned, that’s a good idea.
(Laughter)
So this is what it is, is called an enlightened person, does not stick to anything. And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off. So such a person is not attached to anything, but that is not a mental thing that you can do, that: “Oh! I am not attached to you”, see, it’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”. But you can’t hate anyone: how can you? And nor can you love anyone, because this attachment cannot give you both the qualities. You see, because you are attached to someone, you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person. Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see? So once you have attachment you have both things. One moment you hate, another moment you love, another moment you hate, then you love and you do not know what is the matter with yourself. But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that it is either getting attached mentally or either getting detached mentally. But actually anybody… say you love someone very much, now you do not even die together, whatever you may try. You cannot die together. One person has to die earlier, another has to die
later. So the answer to his question that he asked was, why all these things are caused? So he said it is because of desire. Because of human desire these are all problems are caused. Like the death, like the old age or the sickness are caused by desire.
Now see how in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand him. Is the desire as you know is the left side. Left side gives you death. When the left side is very much used you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted. When the left side is out, desire, you also get sickness. And when the left side is used too much you get your old age. Of course the right side is the one which does it,
but the left side is the originator. If you have no desire you won’t go into the right side.
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire. He reached the point alright, but he did not clearly say what desire means? Desire means the left side. When we have the pure desire which is the Kundalini then all these things are neutralized. When the Kundalini rises, the pure desire, the real desire, the only desire it gives you the absolute by which you do not get old, you do not die and you do not get sick. Because you achieve that which is eternal. It does not die. You become the spirit.
When you want to die you die, when you want to be reborn you are reborn. And you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die. That’s what you take with you. Now you take your realization with you when you die. So what he tried to say was to build up that we should not have any desires. Now because you see, his passage was like that. He went from one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire, that desire, ultimately he came to Kundalini.
There is a saying: Ya neti neti vachane nigamo avoochus when you go on saying “not this, not this, not this, not this, not this, then you go to a point where you say then, what ultimately left is the desire which is the pure desire. The desire that is the Kundalini.
Say for example you say: “I’ll have a house”. No, no, I’ll not have a house. I’ll have a car. No, no car. No. I’ll not have a wife. I’ll not look at any woman. I’ll have nothing to do with it. I give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that, give up that”. Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point and there you realize that the Kundalini rises. But I think it is going too far: why not start from the Kundalini rising, there. Is a simple thing. So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff: is that you better start from the Kundalini; and neutralize all your left side. You see the point now? That’s why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist. He was not, he was not an atheist. But as a matter of policy, he and Mahavira, they were contemporary. They decided let’s not have the name of God anywhere near. Because once you start the God business, big philosophies are built, and people just start claiming it. I mean they become that; actually anybody who reads Gita becomes a, sort of a Krishna, Shri Krishna himself, you see, the way he talks. People, I mean, can be shocked the way they talk. I mean, they are Shri Krishna giving an advice to Arjuna you know, sitting on a chariot.
They behave in that manner you know, their style is like that.
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand, and I was amazed you know, the way he was talking. I was surprised. I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna – of course horrid looking -but he thought he was Shri Krishna himself you see. So that’s what identification takes place with human beings when they start talking about God or his ways and others. So he said, ”Alright put that out, just talk about self realization, that’s the first step”. And Mahavira joined hands with him. It helped that time very much to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see, they would say “It is very difficult you know.
Hinduism is the most difficult thing. You have to fast on Sunday because of the sun, Monday because of the moon, Tuesday because of the Mars”, like that went on and on. And when do you eat your food? (Laughter)
If you have to achieve God, then you have to take your bath at four o’clock, and do this, and do that, and shave your head, and then you become a sanyasi, and you can’t eat this and you can’t eat that and you can’t do that” - all those things, ritualists they started. But he felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa, so half of your desires are finished. You are a sanyasi, you are doing God’s work, and there is no need to have a family or anything. So half of your desires are finished. If you have a family then you want to do something for the family, you have to look after your family and all that is to be done. But he did not realize that he was a realized soul, others were not. You see if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him whether he has a family or no family makes no difference to a realized soul. because he is not attached. But to a person who is not a realized soul - supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house, go to the Himalayas. There what he’ll do, he’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around. Then he may think of a Georgian style of hut – (…) English … - because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious. So we can have, after all we are sanyasis (laughter). That’s typical; I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way if you see. That we should be unpretentious you see, it’s very fussy, is the word they will use. If you put even a little oh it is very fussy.
They want everything to be plain, bland you see. But what about inside? Is filled with what, is all bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that? But the outside should be absolutely bland. Food should not be, if possible just get it in its natural form. If not, don’t have any taste in it. It should be so bland that any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see. All these funny ideas cropped up with that, of asceticism. Then we have other people like Shambalas, who are going now to Gobi desert you see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient, let’s go to Gobi desert (laughter).
So they are now going to Gobi desert. All these absurd ideas came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.
Jainists went to other extreme in vegetarianism, because Buddha himself was not a vegetarian. Do you know that? He was himself not a vegetarian nor was Mahavira, you’ll be surprised. Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy. It was not a sort of a thing where you don’t eat meat and all. Because Buddha himself died when he went to one of his disciples who was a shikari, hunter. And the hunter had killed a wild boar. And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now and it will take some time to cook. It’s rather half done, you see. I mean, He being an Indian he could not eat that half-done thing and he got diseased of the, I think his liver or something got into problem and he died of that you see. I mean I cannot eat half done food myself you see. This is half done now. Half done is a horrible stuff. But we eat because it is unpretentious you see, or some sort of a thing people have ideas it is not, it is very next to the nature you see this is what is coming. But is all deliberate. You are attached inside; outside if you behave like that you are not going to become that. 
Like, hippies have an idea if they live like primitive people then they become primitive. You cannot. Your brain is modern. Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippie, can I become primitive? I cannot, my brain is modern you see. That’s what people don’t understand that we are too deliberate and all these deliberations can be only reduced if your Self comes into your attention. Otherwise, all these are just our mental projections.
So all the sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually, everyone who came on this earth, people have really made mess out of them. And Buddha’s mess has gone to such an extent that if you see that you’ll be shocked. It went into many formations. But I heard from my son-in-law that he went and visited some of the caves where the very early Buddhist, very early Buddhist lived. In the caves they were not supported by kings or anything so they had a bad time. And they used to live in the caves. And what My son-in-law told Me that in thecaves there are writings in Sanskrit and Pali and in Indian script, saying that it is the spontaneous happening that can bring forth the self realization. He got that photographed. So it’s coming forward. You see so they knew about it, the Sahaja Yoga. They knew about it. But then as every religion has gone into a mess and lot of funny sort of, we can say, the funny sort of expressions also Buddhism has gone, it became mahayan, hinayan, all sorts of thing. But one of them was called as Viditama,who ran away from India, settled down in Japan and he started the Zen system of religion, which he kept to the spontaneous happening. That’s one was preserved. Another was the Laotse style who did not talk of God and of Buddha, but of Tao itself: the energy or we can say about the Adi Shakti. So these two good things came out of him. While they searched back of the history of China and they found out the Adishakti lived many years back there as Quan Yin. And that’s how Quan Yin was established as a Goddess for many Buddhist.
Now then Buddha also got into another form because there was a big competition between Hinduism, Hindus of those days and the Buddhist. So they wanted to form… for ordinary people it is very difficult to understand the philosophy. So they thought that we should have Buddha expressed as he has been and he will be. So they formed their, you see, as you say is a maitreya is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisattva and they started making his statues and everything.
So they made Buddha as the God. They started using him to represent the divine power, giving Him forms and things, and like that many things happened.
But Buddha himself was so much frightened of the ritualism that he they said “You should not worship anything, you should not build any temples”. So you see, the loophole was foundout: “If temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas”.
Now in the stupas they put the tooth of Buddha - of course that was sensible to do, I must say - but of course Buddha had said not to do it. And they put it there. He had two disciples called as Sariputta and Moggallana. they were very good disciples of him. And their bones were collected after they were burnt out and were put in the stupas. That was something definitely sensible to put them there. Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed, because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body. But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth it would have been alright, but they put it in caskets. Now the first casket was made of gold, the second of silver, the third of iron, the fourth one of wood sort of thing, to mummify those things. But that was a very wrong thing to do. Because if you go on keeping like that some parts of body of these great people, it can hamper their rebirth or their body which they want to again incarnate, you see.
But hair is all right, or nails are all right, but you should not keep the part of their body like that. And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to horrible human beings. What they did that they thought that if you have to keep some part of the person who died like divine person, why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.
So in Tibet and in all these places, specially in Ladhak you see, they used to cut the hands of the people when they died, and big ritual for the dead and then they started going towards the dead. So they started moving towards the leftside. Most of the Buddhist moved to the left side, which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha, because he is on the right side.
He said “cut down your desires. Do the karmas without the desire”. This was His idea. Activate your right side without the desire. This was His philosophy. But they all of them are left sided. They have desires, not only desires but whatever they do, do it out of their desires.
Like, the worst is like the Japanese: they think that you can commit suicide in the name of your nation. With this desire they will commit suicide. To save their country they can commit suicide. I mean it is absurd. He said whatever you have to do, do without the desire; which is a difficult thing for human beings. How many there are who are doing it without desire. Whatever we do we do out of desire. Even at the subtler point: even when we do puja we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve. 
Can you think of a state where it is absolutely desireless? Only one person has that. There’s no desire, desireless. The whole thing is done without any desire. So there is no disappointment. There is no unhappiness. You are going to America knowingly that it is going to be a horrible experience (laughs) but it is a joke. Just going to see a joke. Without any hope maybe it might work out to be something tremendous; but no desires.
See, it is so desireless, the whole personality is, that even if I have to desire for something I have to ask you “you better desire”, because I havelost the sense of desire. So many times I have said “you better do it for me”. Unless and until you pray to me I can’t do it. That’s why I ask you “write to me a letter” because you see, I can’t desire. I really don’t, I don’t do anything. Without doing anything, it is happening, so why should I desire? I really don’t do anything.
You’ll be amazed I don’t do anything; I don’t desire anything, nothing of the kind. It is working, I am just watching it, and you are saying “Mother you are doing it”, I am quitesurprised. That is Tao. If you read about Tao it is said that it doesn’t do anything. But everything works out. So this is what he said - which was all Sahaja - that you have to be desireless and do everything. And he is the one who controls our ego. Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.
Ego is only built up when you have a desire to do something. That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it. Then how will you build up ego? You cannot. Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away. Creating something just for fun - that’s what God is. Not with the desire to achieve something. I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross. It can become subtler and subtler and subtler, that’s a good way. But can be very, very gross also, like some people can believe that, you see “I should paint it because I’ll get so much money, or I can sell it to somebody who may be the worst man but I’ll sell it because I can get more money“. That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see. That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know: there can be even worse desires than that, can be very many. But on this auspicious day we should not thinkof them, which are there like that. 
But minimum of minimum if you come, just do your puja just for the joy of it, not with any desires. Just for the joy. I mean, we are doing so many things like that: for example we enjoy each other’s company just, just think of that.
You all sahaja yogis are enjoying each other’s company: what’s this for? Nothing at all, there’s no, nothing. Just you are enjoying it without any desire, just for the enjoyment sake enjoyment. When that purity comes, you see, in our temperament, that we do everything without any desire, we have got rid of our ego.
The Buddha is awakened within us. That’s what is the importance of Buddha: that he settled down himself in a place which is themost difficult place, that is on the left side of your head you see (touches left side of Her forehead)
Sometimes I have seen it projects here up to this point you know (touches from forehead to left temple), in some people. They get such a terrible pain you know, pulling it out from there, can’t imagine. So this horrible point which is, so funny it is sometimes, it can blow up like that you see, sometimes it can pierce through; it’s a horrible one which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see, and it takes its forms in different ways and methods - for that we have to say “buddham sharanam gacchami”, means we surrender ourselves to Buddha.
Then what does he say, the second one is very good: “sangham sharanam gacchami”, I surrender myself to collectivity, sangham. Sangha is the collectivity. I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity which is the enlightenment you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha”. Secondly, you say “I surrender myself to collectivity”. Egoistical people cannot surrender. So “I surrender myself to collectivity”, so we say “sangham sharanam gacchami”. It is to Virat we are doing.
What is the third one? “buddham sharanam gacchami, sangham sharanam gacchami”.The third one… “dhammam sharanam gacchami”, dhammam sharanam gacchami. Dhammam means the religion, the balance. I surrender myself to religion which is essence of it. Or you can put it the other way round that: “buddham sharanam gacchami, dhammam sharanam gacchami, sangham sharanam gacchami”. That’s all if you have achieved it then we can talk of God, not before.
So these three things are to be achieved. We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this. First of all dhammam sharanam gacchami, I surrender myself to my virtues. All desires can be surrendered to your virtue. Isit virtuous to do like this? You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it; you’ll have no desires to do something that is not virtuous and righteous. You’ll just not do it. So
dhammam sharanam gacchami. Then you should say buddham sharanam gacchami, means I surrender myself to my enlightenment: this is the second state when you are ascended.
Surrender myself to enlightenment. Enlightenment that I have got to my Spirit, is the Spirit who is going to guide me. No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations. But what, is the Spirit. And thirdly, sangham sharanam gacchami to the collectivity, to the whole, to the Virat. This is the way we have to work it out.
So ultimately reach the same point: that let me start it from myself. From myself to others, not from others to myself. It’s like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots. First you get your realization, alright? Then learn how to surrender yourself to your dharma. Then you become collectively conscious. Collectivity is a temperament, is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living. Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your ego.
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives. And He is a very great, powerful force within us. I’m very happy that Buddha jayanti has fallen here in England, because as we say the Englandis the heart of universe. It doesn’t matter if I say here, is there anybody Arab here? (Laughter) I don’t want to displease any Arab who is sitting here. (Laughs) Alright. And if it is the heart, whatever you do here, will circulate in whole universe.
So if you can conquer your ego here, we can even conquer the ego of Mr. Reagan and these Russians, we can manage that. But first start it here. It has to reverse back you see. Now they have to learn from you, and you don’t learn from them. When it will work out you’ll be amazed. Ego isthe only problem I always face, reaching their hearts. If ego is removed everything will be alright. So for us the great mantra is “buddham sharanam gacchami“ These three mantras you must say everyday I think, to get rid of this horrible ego. Now any questions on Buddha you have? I have made it in a short way, the whole life history is very difficult.
(Pause. Shri Mataji rubs Her hands)
It is receding, ego. English are wise people, sound people. And they must understand this, that there is a very very important thing, that they should not lose these qualities. And should try to fix their enlightenment in such a way that it circulates.
Any question? Gavin told me yesterday its Buddha jayanti, I was very happy because in England I have not talked of Buddha, but otherwise I have talked about him elsewhere.
(Pause. Shri Mataji keeps rubbing Her right hand)
So now, that’s why I wore, you see, a Buddha shawl today: because it is suggestive of a detached mind which has no color. And there could be a personality which is colorless. But you can have it covered with colors to make others happy.
So when you are a realized soul whatever you do is natural, whatever you do. If I am wearing this now I am a Buddha, when I take it out then I am Adishakti. It is not a drama it is a fact. But if you are not a realized soul, before thatwhatever you do is just a drama. For example, this is an artificial thing, I put my hand there and nothing will burn. But if it is real it will definitely burn, whatever I may try. It’s like that.
So if somebody is a real person, whatever he does is not a drama, is reality. That’s how they say that She can take this form, She can take that form: people don’t understandhow can one person take so forms, can. If it is reality it can. Like the Mother Earth she is a reality, and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth takes so many forms. See her power: flowers, this fruit, different colors, fragrance. So many things – is one Mother Earth is producing all these things. Because she is reality. The reality in her can produce. But unreal things, whatever you make out of unreal things, they may look real, but they are not.
So now let us have the puja. And for the rituals also He said, because most of them were unrealized souls you know, they, that they whatever pujas they did was unreal, it was not real, had no meaning. It was giving no effect.
See, worshipping a person who is unreal or any deity who is unreal or those who were not real people – I mean realized souls – what’s the use of unrealized people worshipping Me? I mean, I wouldn’t allow any unrealized person to worship me at all. 
You see, I always tell people, unless and until they are perfectly sahaja yogis, you know them they are good, please don’t bring them for puja. It’s troublesome to me, much more than to them. You see they also feel obliged as if you see, they are obliging me, they think so, by worshipping Me, I don’t know; but they do not know how much they are troubling Me by coming without realization. So the ones who haven’t got realization are really troublesome. They don’t help Me. So the myth some people have that if they come to a puja before realization, they’ll get realization in it, is nottrue.
You should not bring anyone who is not a realized soul or who is not a sahaja yogi to a puja. It’s troublesome and that person also start doubting this, that – is better not to do such a thing. Because also such a person is half baked, so no use giving me half-baked cakes and spoiling the half-baked cake also permanently. Because if you take out the half-baked cake. see, is spoiled forever. I can’t eat it nor you canbake it again. So what’s the use of bringing somebody who is half-baked? Alright? So from next time also this out of compassion you do it. I know you do it out of compassion, but this is not wise. Doesn’t help Me nor it helps others. Alright? So from next time, also any time, you must find out a circular saying that unless and until you are sure about the Realization of a person, that he’s got his realization, you should not call them for the puja. They are no good for Mother and they are not good for themselves. Because they become, you see, doubting or something. You cannot really give them realization after that, can you. Do you remember your friend, had the same problem. Who was he? Nick or something.
Alright. So now we can, Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja. You can read the names of Ganesha. Now, I think those who have not washed My feet before in Brighton should come down. You washed My feet, no? Alright, you come along. Alright, come along. Can you put some towel here. I kept the towel. Take one down.
That was happening, it was just coming out like that. They advertised, and really… I mean, they are honest, they didn’t told us.
Yogi: I looked on the label. They had zinc sulfate in it. They had zinc sulfate in thedescription, in the soap, I would never use it.
Shri Mataji: Horrible. This (name of product?) is a sure short way to baldness. Very fast.
(Laughter)
Absolutely. Shortcut. Anybody who is bald you ask him, he must have used it sometimes. Did you, Gavin? (Laughter from yogis)
That’s it. It has got petrol. You see, they may not write, but from the smell you can know.
These tabacs are all horrid things. Tabacs are…actually this is tobacco, is the word tabac comesfrom tobacco. You see, here the cheating is of a very different kind. They have no consideration. This is real cheating, you see, to put petrol, petrol on your head. You are sure to become bald-headed. I’ll tell you, best is that sapna, sapna oil (…).
[Yogi says something about hairdressers]
They are going to have no profession any more (laughter)
Sapna is very good, I think you all should try sapna, is very good. [Inaudible] But sapna in the best, I think you should put that sapna oil on a Saturday night, put a bit on your head and make the scalp move a little and then you have your bath. Sapna, it’s a homeopathic oil…I think there must be, a homeopathic shop if you go to. And also there is one in India we call (Camphordine?), we don’t get here, it’s very useful. It’s very light. Of course jabakusum is also good if you can mix it up with coconut oil. Jabakusum. One bottle of coconut oil and half a bottle of jabakusum or just the other way round. If you mix it up and use that, it’s very good. You can keep it in a tin bottle and use it. It’s very good, jabakusum. You get it here, jabakusum. It’s made out of that red plant, nowwhat you call that, hibiscus. Thank God you see we are not so good at artificiality in India. Really. Same with these, all these your Cami soaps and all these things. Really. They will give you a soap which will finish your skin. And then they will give you a cream which is even worse. It’s a mutual understanding. So you try, I could say that yellow colour sandalwood is good. It’s very mild for the skin. It’s very good for you. So that chandrika soap was good but now they are also mixing up something (…) You should use that, is a good one. Absolutely mild soap it is. Not the black one, the yellowish one.
(Yogi says: Sainsbury’s makes some good soap)
Which one?
(Yogi says: Sainsbury’s makes some good soap)
How can they? I must say… They are not good, you see, it must be some joke. (Laughter) Somehow they can’t make anything mild, you know, they cannot make anything mild. Why can’t they make something mild? The soap should be such that your skin must come out. Your washing, mouth-washing liquid is such that I put it on enameled work from vadaban, it was at least sixty-seventy years old, you see, we had. And as soon as I put it the whole enamel finished. Can you imagine, we got such a shock. All the enamel within us must be going out from the teeth also… (laughs, laughter). All enamel of the thing came off and I was amazed, where it has gone. Completely dissolved. I wonder from where they made them, what they made them of.
(A yogi says: “The Pepsi Cola is the worst stuff for that. Some dentist tried an experiment of leaving some false teeth in a glass of Coca-Cola overnight and in the morning it had disappeared.
They just dissolved, Mother”. (General laughter)
Coca-Cola or Pepsi Cola? Which one, Coca-Cola or Pepsi Cola?
(Yogi: Yes, one of those, but the problem was…)
Pepsi, Pepsi might be. Because you see, Coca-Cola formerly was horrid, I used to feel terrible. But now I’ve tasted it, I don’t find it so bad, they have changed something in that.
Yogi: They took the cocaine out of it, I think, Mother.
Shri Mataji: But I used to feel terrible before, I would never touch Coca-Cola. But now I, it’s alright. Better take Indian tonic water, I think, there’s something good about it. Or this Perrier water, whatever it is. Now good now, let’s see this.
[Talks to a yogini who is washing Her Feet]
How are you? More in the right. Left is not good. Rub it hard. What did you do before Sahaja Yoga?
What a horrible combination, rub it hard. Drug is one of the worst things, you must use oil for your hair. You must use hair oil, drop it like that and take it out, because I think is a some part of the brain just becomes dead. Hard, hard, hard. Yes.
…doing it but you feel you are doing it, then it’s a double problem. I’ve seen it. When you are not doing it, and you are feeling you are doing it, it’s criminal, isn’t it? But somebody who is doing it and not feeling it because that person is not conscious about it, not bothered about it. It’s too little to think that you are doing something. It’s too little. Is a too small a thing, it’s too low a thing to think that “I am doing”.
Would be such a ridiculous thing to say: “I have done this”, you see, such a thing to be said. Isn’t it? And such a person comes everywhere: “Oh, I did like this and I did this” you think, such stupid fellow what is he talking? It’s such a ridiculous thing, I tell you, to say: “I have done it”. So, after Sahaja Yoga you also start saying: “Mother, it’s not working, it’s not coming up, it’s not there”. You don’t say: “I cannot do it, I am doing it, I am giving realization”, you don’t say this. You just say: “It’s not coming, it’s not there, it’s not in the hand”, like that. You see, so you also start becoming a third person. You just don’t take the credit for it at all. Only the joy of it comes to you, that’s all. But you don’t take the credit or . That should happen gradually to all of us, and happens, automatically, to start talking like that.
Today’s puja you must notice I’ve changed the mode completely, because of Buddha’s influence, you know. He didn’t want to have too much of Puja.
Alright, so now, what we have to do is to put something, a cloth, here.
