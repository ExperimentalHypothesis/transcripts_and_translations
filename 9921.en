Public Program Day 1

So okay. If you find anything, they see you come back here. Hi, bob. Toe all the seekers of truth and the truth that we are seeking. Has to be a tv understood and felt. Through a very open mind. I cannot conceive retirement elective. And you cannot form your own ideas and conventions about like a scientist, you have to keep your mind off a team. Whatever. It is a evolutionary process, the process by which you have become a human being. And, logically, it should follow that you cannot put in any effort. To become the higher personal. You have putting no effort for the revolution so far, totally. You have paid no money becoming god doesn't understand me. This is created by human beings god has no sense of, i don't know. Also, perhaps how maddening it is for human beings, so you cannot pay for it's something ridiculous to think that you can pay for your sins, or to say that you can going into a course off because it is the living process, off your evolution living process. If we understand that living process, you will understand so much. If you have. If you have to sprout a seed, you just put it in the mother and she's, proud how much money. She doesn't understand money. She only knows how to sprout the sea. So then you put the seed in the mother it's crowds spontaneously, sod saw me. What jeremy's born it is born with the capacity to sprout the capacity to awaken. Your kundalini is born. What it has to be. The mother who has to do the job, like every seed, has all the maps ofthis past and all its future. You have those maps within yourself, and once you just become. Capable off getting enlightened, you get your enlightenment, but they should not put any diffidence into her mind. Many people start thinking that you have to do the cleansing first, and then you get realization. When you are inside the dirt, how can you cleanse ? So this. So have you got today is up this way that first, to get out of it first, have a little like in your life, the lightest there, the land. If it is dirty, it is easier to clean the lamp, which is in lighter dan between alarm, which has no enlightened. That's. My first. You get yourself realizes. That is very important before we deal with anything else, that you must get yourself a realization. This is what christ has said, that you are to be born again. He didn't mean some sort of an artificial baptism he never meant. How could he mean logically, you must understand that if iwas, too, he would not, that you can have a false the baptiste, but what he has said that by this, your spirit baby means a person who has got his spirit and lighter gannon lighting. A knight what a candle which is already enlightened cannon like in another life but what has it done that it had the life the other one was ready so the light pass from one planet there is no obligation there is no greatness about there's nothing special so as far as we're concerned we are all ready today to have your realization many people have met so far in the west specially wantto escape the truth because they say that mother we have to cleanse ourselves you go ahead how many years you have been doing that how many lives ? How many ages now stop is finished now better have your enlightenment and then see how we can very nicely clean yourself and see what's wrong water would it is very difficult to tell anyone even if you see the dirt in a person that this is is better that supposing there's something wrong with the shore about to take it out and see for myself what's wrong with you i can't in the same way you get out of yourself to see for yourself what's wrong and that is how it will be much easier for you to clean if you know how to clean yourself so you become the person who is the spirit the spirit safe the defect in you under spirit guides on cleanses you complete there is no more guide leader or no bruce lee did you become your own group now. So many kinds of people have come to sell their goods. Cinema you cannot sell, and the one who lives on your earnings is a parasite. He cannot be a holy person or the same peepers. Christ did not take any money from people didi he was brought in as a carpenter son, any worked as a carpenter, but what is the book ? Officer, what is the purpose ofthe, like, coming to boston ? Is this that we all deserve this ? Higher state is all your own. It is your right. I should say, i'm like a banker. Now go get your justice. The purpose of this happening is complete transformation. The transformation has to take. What is the problem off the world. Today is moral crisis. People are warning, absolutely fact out died. They have lost all their discretion. They don't know what to do there, so confused. Whether this is true or that is because we live in related work, everything is relative. This will do that. We'll do, everybody's compromised. They don't know what is absolutely because we have not achieved our absolute within hours. Now the most remarkable thing about the absolute that is the spirit days that the absolute is the one that is collectively conscious. That's. The world that can feed dad that's, the one which knows about everybody else. That's, the one, officials also about yourself, so far as a human being, the spirit has not come into our consciousness. It's, not and, like it's, not yet and like means your consciousness hasn't got the light off. This fitted is in your heart. On this spirit is just watching you as a witness. It has not entered into your consciousness into your attention, and because of that, you do not know what is absolute, what is collective consciousness. When it happens to you, it happens in your organs. It doesn't happen in your mental conceptions, like i can give you a big book to read on. Then you become something. Your own consciousness, which is a human consciousness, becomes a higher consciousness, which becomes collectively conscious. Means it is an actualization. Like a person who is a human being. I can feel the dirt and filth, the colors. I love you, but an animal. So something is happening consciousness, actually, that we can feel the field. In the same way, when you become absolutely everything, that is not absolute, start getting. It just disappears, and you become absolute yourself, which is the drug. You become absolute joy. You become absolute consciousness so far, the consciousness has moved to the human stage. In such a way that we have not failed that we have moved higher because we were not made like that at the human state only we are made in a special way if you see yeah as you can see it clearly that from the left side that's a new balloon like stuff right this blue is nothing but all over conditioning which becomes what we call insects with vanessa but very closely we can call it a super team where we are conditions don't do this don't do that we are born to say as i mean it how many starks through you are you won't be god never created america it is we have hated america england mystics he just created a one beautiful right so then you adam identification starts like that then you go ahead and you think we are christians are hindus or muslims then you go ahead with that well misidentification start accumulating within us on all of them from an artificial team called super ego in your one condition all the positions all the opposition's all sorts of things that you get it in many lives can be there called as super on the other side we have got the the run that green accumulated in ourselves create with the nurses by what because we think we have done this is the eagle actually human beings cannot do any what they do is to explore whatever is dead they cannot living work they cannot transfer one flower in tow even one fatality all this living work is done by some we do not think how we are treated how is beautiful human being instead we haven't got humility to understand that this something great has happened to us that there is some sort of force some living force some very kindly loving force that has done this we never even felt how we were treated like this without any things we are created as human beings this great living work that is happening within us who has done this living hi we have never said that all pervading power of god that is doing all these things not only that but it starts out things it's such a beautiful mechanised like a mango tree will give you mangoes if it's an industry it will give you on us like that you have all times of day sorting out such a next in your child you looked like you who does all the talking all this power that does all the living world scientists also have not done their faces they're honest but they're not so educated they're not so well informed on their seeking is very limited because their brains are limited their mental capacity is low if they have to go flood them they have to become higher personalities to be able to see how we are created how do we exist and how this living forces now for us, as we take everything for granted, we do not even think about it is a good thing. Otherwise, you might go mad thinking that we do not know about the power that does the living. So we have an idea that we do this work on that. What will we do supporting a trees that you make this floor charge this. That old studio is dead from the dead. We have just change the forms from dead today. What special thing. And when we start thinking that we have done something, that is how we develop. Like people going in a plane, we're told not to take too much luggage in a village. They talked it's better to reduce the weight of the place, so they put the weight on their head. Sitting in the plane the same way are putting the weight on our heads, thinking that thiss job the run was created. You, the one who has made you a human being, is going to make you. Why do you take the lord upon yourself ? That's. Why, mr ego six on your head like a heavy weight, i have to do this. I have to do that without understanding the plan of the duel. That's all we have ego and super ego sitting on our head on we start feeding that we are something great now this happening has taken place within us because we are human beings a dog doesn't have responsibilities a such whatever he does he does through his responses throw it so far but human being has developed the ego and because of that his brain is closed down he is like a a about this has been specially made to become the bird on that transformation has to take place which is all built in within you you have all these powers within it has to just be clicking on the walk off the love off the divine has to work it out so that you become the bird off complete absolute freedom this is what christ wanted to inform us right here is the desert i when we have easter you know that we have eggs egg is suggesting that you are today but on in mr kleist as he became the bird you also become the books and so we should say the time has come for all of you to become the first but it is impossible for human beings because they're such made i don't know how especially in the west to understand that there could be somebody who is genuinely interested in the well being of others they cannot understand because of the ready to ideas they cannot understand that there should be somebody who should do this job ? You sure company with people who are seekers give them their truth and give them their transformation. To put them up on their consciousness has realized salt now, actually in the movement of consciousness. When human beings were born what they started, they started sorting out everything on mentally everything. One mental level on whatever work on mental level he works out in a leader man, like there is no sustain inside. If something starts moving in, a legal rate falls off again. Records that's where today we are we have evolved so much have developed so much are supposed to be developed people on then how it we're on the brink of a show. Why did he stop saying what does have gone wrong with us ? Where did we go wrong ? Because we tried to solve over problems through mental efforts. Anything take your politics. Take your economics is nothing but a mentalist. For example, economic say's that once in general, are not session that grease there must be someone special reliving the relative wants each other session. Now what is that one ? Which is up to you, which will satisfy on that one is represented here as this traveler. The traveler board. You can see the condominium that is fuel desires with your design to be one with the divine on, unless, in antique, that bizarre manifest, all your wants will be changing from one twenty like today. You would like to have a house, what i would like to have a car, and after tomorrow, something else than a helicopter than a narrow planet going like, but actually to have your old ones hurt this way. There is one one which is given sleeping, as they say, because it has not manifested in the triangular born, which is to be awaken, which is to be manifested. Now, just imagine this bone is called. I'm sick means greeks also knew that it is a secret book, that's. Why they call it. You can see the rising of the moon. Melanie, you can see the position of the company, you can feed the percussion of the like lapped up his heart is in some people have described it on then you can feel the cool breeze coming off now what is this kundalini giddiness the spirit is in your heart but what about the funeral she is the holy ghost she is the representation or the reflection off the hook but if you asked anybody else they said no i don't know what goes is a mystery inside you're nothing is a mystery everything can be explained now what is the forty cost it's the holy ghost is the primordial mother is the mother hi marty but people never talked about wouldn't they talked of the father and the son imagine a father and a son and no mother it is absolute have you seen any father and a son without a mother such an absurd situation comes in that people accepted because it's all mental somebody tells you know it's on the street there's no mother there's no people but there has to be a mother i'm this's the time of aquarius what we call incense with uma meaning dick radius is the condoms where'd she auditions ready she kills you should issue she guides you counsel on this is the time off the mother we had the time of the father then of the sun and now this is the time off the mother where she has to know where she has to take you to our ultimate goal that is the spirit. The consciousness itself, the way we have been moving in other directions, have bean like people think that if a woman starts fighting for her on then she's asserting the family she's, not what i'm not. What i'm saying is not meant for women or men is meant for everyone of us that we have to become like mother. Like a divine like a person look at this who can give them now affection attention plus evidence for it this is only possible for a mother too and that mother should be awaken in every human beings i would say abraham lincoln you had was a great person like after that also we have had so many great people in this world who have been like that because in our country we have matt morgan we had many people of that department move it do they not ashamed curing on helping others in such a way as a mother would like to nourish our own church so the sense of nourishment has to come between us but we have no power off and that only comes when your spirit starts manifesting when this power lies is she manifests hard power off she actually delicious your class she's the one who initiated those subtle centers which look after these grow centers she's the one who cures she is the one who guides because she informs you what's wrong with you she's the one constant because once you become collectively conscious then you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand on this becomes like a cunt you become a computer off which you become the master you are already a competent if you understand because in a comfort food put something it cannot just cnc it has to take what we can just see and cities as soon as you see, we know what. We are already a wonderful computer, which no a scientist can produce. But we become even conscious of that computer and become master of that computer so that we know everything about whatever is not known to us. Unknown. All absolute problems can be asked, and we can find out what's. Wrong. But it is not that the consciousness moves like a pendulum like. Lighting a match on becoming egotistical and fighting and shouting and then behaving like a man or a man becoming like a woman who's spending but you move in a spiral you know what rise and that higher point you start seeing that like a spring has a spiral you have seen and it has a sustains it's not clean when the spring roses six sustains has become leader like in the pectorals you see in the country as are all spy larry spiraling on human beings so they have created so many reptiles it's all kinds of familiar sex and all that put into it they are not even five percent equal to what natural reptiles were but we make them leading by our wrong on then the petals become senior on they lose their biological effect because they become lifeless in the same bed i said takes place in a spiral away on rises higher than one verities it doesn't move like a pendulum a man becoming a woman a woman becoming like a man but what happens is you develop a hired punches in that higher consciousness you start understanding that now you have become the life now what is the life still you have to make the light to work hard but you try but once it is made the life you put it on top what that it becomes the boom it becomes the guiding factor it becomes everything that's how you become so we have got the left side of design and the right side effects. These left side or right side of passion can be compared with the. With the break i, the accelerator in a car to understand it on a very gross. Exact it's on what happens that when we start learning how to drive, we get into the car we used brought these dollars, tried to balance ourselves first of all, balanced. The car is very important, fine. When we have learned how to use these two forces, then we think we have become drivers. At that time, we were total etiquette. We don't think about that's. What happens to you that first, when kundalini rises about this center, you become heartlessly aware that means there is no pot, but we're completely aware, mother, i'm gwen. This slice is from here here is the seat of the spirit does the seat recites in human beings in the heart when it touches the seat of the spirit then the master who's city at this backseat watching you you become the master when you start watching these two forces within you how it is acting on also the driver bidding on you become the master this is the second state into ritual now with you become thoughtlessly aware what happens is that a thought rises and falls on it part rises on foot i'm in the center after two hearts is little area now these tarts made eyes from the future or from the past i'm the center part is the present so when the kundalini rises what happens you've become basement in the present where there is no party if i say stand on the present you cannot because we are on the future or the past because it will start but when the tarts are removed you stand in the center ofthe those two parts i'm you've become talk nicely aware at this time it's such a wonderful state that at that time whatever you see becomes a picture memory not only has a memory but the joy of creation starts pouring you start understanding the joy off collusion and lots of powers you started manifesting that at this time you can cure you can heat them physically may be mentally ill but that's not enough in that also you should not get lost some people of course we'd buy some other forces which are spared what they do is to put some spirits into a purse and take out some spirit transparent so spiritually this is absolutely a different area into which we don't have to go we have to do everything which is complete spirit ourselves masters knowing everything about what you are never under the blanket no doubt you see everything what you are doing what you are getting this powers that are going to your hand you know what exactly they mean they are all recorded for you you don't have to research it and you can only verify evidently month who brought his realization from me and then he said mother i can't believe i can be collectively conscious because you see the brains here are working too much the heart is less the brain is too much listen in batons between the heart and the brain so i said all right driving robbery by asking you've been very five he said i want to know please take the child out please find out harry stone he said i want to find out how is my father i said all right just put your hands like i'm trying to find out how is your father so he says but i'm getting a very he may teach here in this boarding very funny feeling so i said alright if that so these are all the centers that are indicating your father if it is in this fingered girl feeling then you must know that you must be down with very bad bronchitis because this finger we note the center here so he telephoned his father in my place and his mother came to the phone and she said he is down with very bad bronchitis the same sentence she used so that's how you've been so you must know that in the realm of god we are really fantastic we have to enter into the realm apart you have to become the citizen of course then on be amazed that he has the greatest capacity like you cannot imagine how dynamic hurry to us that have been so many incidents in sergio ghia that people can tell you sometimes how miracles have to be records have taken place which they cannot explain how it has worked or not miracles like getting a diamond one should understand that those people who were after diamonds are not the people who are seeking god they want damages they can get it in the month some people who start jumping the thing that become god how can it be are going to become frogs we should understand also logically what is going to happen to us that we are going to be empowered by a power which we should know how to handle otherwise no use doing all these tricks these these people are doing some peoples are just jumping, some start shouting, screaming, some becoming dogs, some becoming like a lion. You are not to go to your subconscious because god has placed so beautifully. Your subconscious is on the left hand side on your right side. So you there is a room kept for you in the center like you made a home here like there was a room there. But the idea all the psychologist here was so confused that some of the indians maybe have taken a little flu from that, and they have come here to take you down to subconscious, which is the easiest thing to do is to take down and that's what they have done. They have mesmerized people, started these girls in his false gurus have come on there just nothing but taking you to our subconscious, where you get caught up and processed by the collective subconscious, and you think you are in the best position because you don't know where you are. You have no idea. So the best thing for us is to see. What we get ourselves what we know ourselves some people everyone six thousand some people that we were fifty thousand for what are you giving money it is something i can't understand it i came about ten years back your great country america they couldn't understand me when i said you cannot pay money for and they threw threw me out so they wouldn't take me seriously they said what are you talking is done how can you uh do things without money so this is what it is but i think after ten years off good lashing from these people they have learned a lesson now they're coming around i have been kind to me so you must understand one has to be humble it's only the ego that makes you think that you can party that you can organize it that you can organize god organized religion organized all that divide you cannot organize that they told you changing off one problem toe through they need us too much to think that you can all the night we must humble down within ourselves and that's how it works out it works out it has worked in thousands and should work out everywhere sure in boston also it should work but there are categories and categories off people that i must admit for example steve i must say the special getting you met barely runs bristol one program here from just all you have on then he came to see me next ninety percent of person he met only once and then he said he has to go to buster i said a very good idea go to buster i hope i reach you when i came to america two years back we just sent me a telex he said mother i'm in boston when you come here we'll have was occupying us well small little room on dh sweetly invited me there i said all right i'm going to boston people said mother you don't know him very realized that i don't have forever i'm going and i came here and we had a program in boston on today because of quality off people who are running it we have a nice proper center we're now many people can get the realization on set but there have gotta grease off very mystical peoples are very funny people like some people in the church came to hit me with the bag you can imagine in the church they came to hit me with it and on such people are there but those people what of that activity the best who get their realization in no time and said some people have physical problems that's well also they cannot get realization but the people who are mean to fall schools and have been their heads before them also are very difficult they have too little bit patients with them first of four to neutralize the effects of this false and then they get realization but some of them i was amazed the other day in toronto i gave realization to some people who have been to those gurus on they just threw everything because they treat right conclusion that they have not found they had not found the truth undead best thrown away everything apart and they got their realization so we have people in people we have people who coming to soldier walls after that they become very violent very hot tempered now not so well organized and you find that that temperament doesn't look like a really nice suit but all kinds of people come to surgery on the negative people will always see the people who are lauren and see them and start criticizing or look at me side only the person who has achieved a balance a person who has achieved the mustard over the one who has all the knowledge how to raise the kundalini on how to give their position surgery is not every time you can have this one one should understand but everybody comes to such yoga everybody is allowed to come we have all kinds of people all types but the soldiers are a special category who mature like a c which is just sprouted has to be looked after they re tenderly carefully respectfully on then it grows into a victory and when it becomes the tree nobody has to be told don't have to tell them bye alter that this is a tree everyone knows this is the tree so this is how it works out those people are positive about it get it into their heads faster fall on then into their hearts i'm sure it would look out even here and there are so many people here it should work out too well off i didn't know that the program is only for two days in any case two days i'll be here that is today tomorrow in the short time whatever is possible and tried to cover but it's the knowledge is like a potion but you've become the knowledge which i'll tell you how to become the knowledge and you don't have to listen to too many lectures to understand me but i started i'm concerned i've been lecturing and lecturing for the last ten years and in london if you see there are thousands of pictures of mine but you can see for yourself this happens much better in a place where people are not so complicated thousands off them can get realization people who are here i've seen thousands of indian indian religious get their realization but maybe people are much more oppressed by the modern society modern ideas lady that they take a little time to go but doesn't make you our people off great at rachel on people of great qualities loves your sentence your mentor are born in this country all over even in england i saw so many people who are men of god and as william blake said that men are gone, will become profits, and they would have powers to make others profits. That's. What ? You have to have so many off your sayings, that you're born in a such a nice country like america, it's, such a highly blessed country, is such a great, beautiful country on. Then you have to make the best out of maybe. If you have any questions, you can ask. I miss that dog. Yes, thank you, yeah. Okay, that's. Good. He really wants to know god, he prays to god. You said that this is the crisis center. Here you die. No, but it is true. How long will it take him to know ? God split off a second ? Split of a second fine. It will happen in a split of a second, no doubt. But nothing is guaranteed. You see, you cannot say if all the seats is proud of the same time, but it is guaranteed that tree ultimately. All right, there is no time for what god does not know time. Any other questions ? Yes. Please, no! After you get your enlightenment, you self realization. And you start to become integrated. What happens to you physically ? After what ? What happens to you after physical death ? You see that he should not be futuristic. Why do you want to think of that time talking off life, but off course, i've been a big lecture on that. You can take a tape and hear about it, but just that we're talking about life, not about alright, you are realized, so if you want, you can take your birth again, do what you like a free bird after you're dead, there's something like death after that, because you entered into a round, but there is no that you know, you're dying. I'm changing this body and you can take the body again. It's. A very different awareness, all right, no. If three do you need faith to god ? You see faith in fitness, blind faith ? That's, on the contrary, is very dangerous. Most people who have blind faith are very dangerous people because they really are about certain mental aspect traffic on, they're bound to some sort of a mental conceptions that this is god, this's, god, this's, god is wrong, but you must have an open mind. Even if you deny, then it's, not proper, because you keep your mind open, that is like sunshine. If you are facing, the sunshine will be affected by sunshine, but if you hide yourself from sunshine, the sun chinese are going to run after. You but don't know. I mean, when you are in life, you see, the thing is, i don't want to talk about myself. The trouble is, christ just said that he was the son of god, all right, and they crucified him. That's a fact iwas, but he did crucified him, and i don't want to talk about myself till you have your lighter. When you have your enlightenment, anyone, nobody, all right, you better have your light first, and then you know me otherwise, it's. Difficult. I'm tactful in this lifetime. I don't want to get crucified. Yes, you, we'll have to put it right on. So many people have got it even back broken realization. First, they're back is trite, and they feel all right on. Then they get the candle in jai's, not difficult. It's, a repairing system, it's the best. But if something is deadly, new supporting you, summer still sticks into your legs that we can't remove it to see that's. If it is a dead stuff inside, we cannot help you, but if it is a living machinery, it just gets repaired. It has to be a living thing inside. When the kundalini rises, does it maintain that position ? Or does it go down again ? That's true, it goes downwards in many it goes down, it comes up and goes down. See, in some people it does. I mean, i would say that you meant very much there but with many people it goes down on the reason why go star is because it comes to the flat. You see, because it faces me knows me. It comes up like a flood on then it goes down because you need nourishment in different centers. Supposing you have a problem somewhere it goes and nourish issue. Then again, it nourishes very sweetly comes up again. But if you know once you have touched, they certainly has come out of it. And if you know how to raise it again and again, you can bring it. If that's what you have to learn after realization and that is called i should've been there means that true knowledge ofthe divine activity once you know that how is very simple. You have to use on your hand like this you have to move it on. Bring it up. You have to give yourself a balance a little bit only because it's going through your hands that's all on you can, man it's. Not different. You can. You can establish a little bit in the beginning about a month, you'll have to watch, but not all. I'm saying, just few people really get it, like you say, steve was like that, you got it. What is all of this really happening ? Yeah. It is too fantastic to believe. It is happening as dropping something. God waas created this creation. You see his body on. He has to look after his creation, isn't it ? He's anxious. It has to happen. After all, we are not responsible for this creation. He has created it, so he has to jolly well hope after. It's happening ? You can't believe it, isn't it ? It will work. Have faith in yourself, that's all. You must have faith in yourself and nothing else, yes. Be gentle not all right, you should not see visions. That means you're not normal. You're on the right hand side you shot on the right hand side you start seeing me just the other day we had one boy who's to see auras vigils but he told me his head is heavy all the time. You feels very heavy on that. You don't feel all right and we had to know that because you must see the present the really as at the time of christ, people started seeing the regions ofthe moses but christ was there living every night they were thinking off they had the vigils off moses on a bronc whatever tries to give it. Now today i am here now you will think taking regions ofthe crust what about me ? I'm in the present so you have to be in the present, not in the future or in the past, but when you see visions it could be from the fast or from like in india people see visions and they have their own regions of the davies and goddesses and all and then they deny everything they say that no, how are we to be leaving christ or his mother or anything ? But when they come to the prison you understand that they were all dead. They are dead in the present because you become one side. Region is not a normal thing. It's not very good. And those people who see visions end up into very bad life, very bad life, because it's not normal, even know gradually how you see regions. Also, what happens to. But after realization, we just come in the center. Yes. What is in condom inside yoga ? Does the kundalini go beyond the seventh chakra ? Of course, it's can go beyond much beyond, but depends on see how you are. It has to go, it is for the complete growth ofthe person. There are three centres about what you have to cross. There are some people who have crossed, no doubt there are so but you see there, there are really a serious i should say off, so they are captivity, i should say there's, so many things about them quality itself, you cannot send much more seven cries.
