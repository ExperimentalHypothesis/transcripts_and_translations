 (England)
I was very shy, not as brave as all these yogis you see here. Since the beginning, I was very impressed by Mother, and I would always stand at the back. You had to drag me to come and see her. I remember that at the beginning—and still now—I find it much easier to communicate with her without a physical presence.

For instance, when they started to say that she was the Holy Spirit, I thought, "Oh my God, I'd like to believe that, but she would have to prove it to me." I remember that at those Caxton Hall meetings, she would be stroking everybody's hands and talking to everyone, but she would always ignore me. All the answers I wanted, she would give me during the talk.

One day, she was talking about the Holy Spirit, which was a bit difficult for me to accept in front of my friends. I remember praying to her on the way to that meeting, saying, "Okay, give me a good answer. Show me again who you are. Explain to me about this Holy Spirit." It was just in my head. I got there, and there were about 100 people. Again, I was at the back. During the talk, she gave an explanation about it and then went "Hmm," looking straight back at me. I was so impressed. I thought, "Oh my God, how does she know I wanted to know that?" This happened in many instances, so I always stayed back.

But I got caught with the problem of the curtains in her house. I was living in Chelsham Road, and one day they said Mother needed some people to work at her house. I would normally find other people around London so I wouldn't have to go, but that day, there was nobody, so I had to go.

I arrived there, and it was about curtains. I never thought about measuring curtains, and I don't know anything about sewing or cutting. Shri Mataji took me down into the dining room and said, "Now, I want to make curtains here. Rosie is going to make them. So, we are going to measure. You are going to measure this, that, and that." She was talking to me, but I went blind. "Did you understand me?" she asked. I said, "Yes, Mataji," and there I was in front of the window, thinking, "What am I going to do now?" I figured she wanted me to measure.

She came back later because there were so many people working in the house. She passed by and asked, "Okay, is it going okay?" I had the measuring tape in my hand, trying to figure something out. Half an hour later, I was still there. She said, "Okay, have you understood?" I looked at her like... "Okay, I'm going to explain it to you. Look, measure this, that, that." She gave me the measurements, maybe two or three meters, and I put it right in my head. I thought, "Okay, all I have to do is listen to Mother's measurements, and then I can go home."

She gave me the measurements, and I was repeating them. I was living in Willesden Lane, I think, and I went to Rosie. Rosie was very down-to-earth and practical; she was always at Mother's house doing things, very easy-going. I said, "Rosie, Mother gave me these measurements for the curtains." She said, "Okay, what are they?" I gave her the numbers. She said, "Are you crazy? That would mean we need kilometers of material. That can't be."

I said, "Yes, Rosie, Mother told me. I'm pretty sure."

She said, "No, no, it's far too much."

"Mother said, Rosie. I don't know."

Then she phoned Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji said, "What? What did he say to you? Of course not, it can't be!" And then she said, "I don't know why you married Alex for such..." So, I was always... Another time, also, she called us.
