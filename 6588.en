Public Program. Prague (Czech Republic), 17 August 1991.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it or we cannot change it. Unfortunately we cannot also know it with this human awareness. We have to become a subtler being to know the truth; that is, we have to be the spirit. For that one has to understand that it's a evolutionary living process. It is a living happening within us which makes you the spirit, for which you cannot pay. You cannot put any effort, but it just works because you are seekers of truth. 

Whatever I am telling you, you have to listen to it with a open mind of a scientist. If it is proved to be the truth, you have to accept it as honest people, because it is for your benevolence and benevolence of the whole world. We see beautiful flowers here, but we take them for granted. We do not even think that they just come from small little seed. Look at our eyes, what a micro-camera it is, but we take it for granted. So, one must understand that there is some power which does this living work. 

So the first truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego or conditionings, but you are, but you are pure spirit. The second truth is that there is a subtle power of divine love which does all the living work. Through that power only we have become from amoeba to this stage, and there is a very small breakthrough that we have to achieve, to know the truth. We do not know the absolute truth. That is why we are quarreling with each other, fighting with each other, we have wars. But if all of us know the truth, it is only one. As you all can see Me sitting here, you all know that I am sitting here, there's no quarrel about it. But when you become the spirit, then you can feel this all-pervading Power which you have never felt before. You feel it on your fingertips, and also you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

In the Bible there is the God Almighty as the Father God, and we have the Son God. And the Trinity, the third one is the Holy Ghost. But how can you have Father and the Son, and no Mother? The women are called as "second citizen" because they say that She was not on the table of the twelve apostles, who were having the Last Supper. But then how do you have Paul there, who was not sitting on the supper table also? But people could feel the Mother of Christ as a Goddess, so they called her as a Madonna. And I can't understand, those who do not want Her as the Goddess go and worship Her as Black Madonna in Poland.

In the same way in every religion they have created problems, because they wanted to have it organized the way they wanted to have it. So the people concluded that there is no God, because whatever religion one may follow, they can commit any sin. So they lost faith in God. But when you will become spirit you will know that there is God Almighty and His love, His all-pervading living Power. It can be proved by Sahaja Yoga that there is God, and there is His power of love. Whether you believe in God blindly or don't believe in it, it's just the same. Many people come and tell Me that "Mother, we pray to God and nothing happens to us. We are just like people who do not believe in God." The reason is, you are not connected with God. If this machine is not connected to the mains, it won't work. If your telephone is not connected, it won't work.

So the first thing is to get connected to this all-pervading Power. And all of you have got this divinity within yourself. You all can get your Self-realization, and get connected to this all-pervading Power. You should have no diffidence about it. It's so simple. "Sahaja" means it is born with you, and all of you have the right to get this connection, yoga, without any difficulty. As a result of that, all your physical, mental, emotional problems can be solved. Even your material problems are solved. Above all, you enter into the Kingdom of God, which is the ocean of joy. This is what is going to happen to you. This is extremely simple, which you cannot achieve by reading, by studying or by doing anything. It is not the mental act, but it's a living happening.

Today I think you have heard about the kundalini and the power which is within you. So tomorrow I will tell you about the nature of the spirit. In this short time it is difficult to give the complete idea of this knowledge of the roots. I must have given at least four thousand lectures on this subject in English language only. So, like here there are so many lights which we can put on with one switch, but if I have to tell you about the electricity and its history, and how it came here to Prague, you'll get bored. Only one switch can open the light, because it is all built in. In the same way it is all built in within you. So it is better to get this enlightenment, and then to know about the subtle subjects.

But in any case, I would like you to ask Me questions for a short time. Only My request is not to ask Me questions which are not related to the subject. Please try to understand that I have not come here to take anything from you. I have come here to give you what is your own. You may ask Me questions.

(Can you move this from top, in front? Remove all this from there. You can remove all this from the front, because people can't see Me. Do this now .... Baba - very cold, but it's all right. I'll have My spectacles. It's all right, just I'll have My spectacles. Spectacles.)

(Loudly.) [Yogini translates question: "You have helped me in Vienna" - with her ears. But she doesn't hear that well.] 

All right, that's different. I will see to it again. Did you meditate? All right, we'll see it again. All right, sit down and we'll see it again. We'll see you tomorrow.

They have no questions? Wonderful people!

[Question]

I first of all told you, have no diffidence, and don't judge yourself. The question was, if they are not ready. Your kundalini knows everything about you. She is your mother, your individual mother, and she's anxious to give you your second birth.

[Question: To awaken kundalini, we have to meditate for a long time. What does it mean, a long time to meditate?]

You have already done it in previous life, everything. That's why you are here. You are destined to be here.

[Question: How do You see the future of the Earth?]

Of what?

[Yogini: Of the Earth. Of our Earth that we are living on, its future.]

In Prague?

[Yogini: How do You see the future of the mankind?]

Great!

[Question: There are many wars in the world nowadays, and very much violent. And my question is, what must come before the joy will come?]

You see, these wars are because of the problems with human beings who have created them. If you could transform human beings, these problems will be solved automatically. If certain number of people are transformed, they'll trigger it. Already there are thousands who have been transformed, and you can transform others when you are transformed.

[Question about the gipsies.]

Any race, whether these are gipsies or any race, can get their transformation. It has nothing to do with your race, your nationality or your religion, nothing to do. It is something inner, innate. As long as you are a human being it will work out. The best part of it, that all so-called bad karmas are also washed off. Only human beings think that they do bad karmas, not the animals.

[Question about Christ.]

Of course, of course. But Christ has said that those who are not against us are with us. All these incarnations and all these prophets are related to each other. So we see them separated, and this creates hatred between people. ... (There's one more there.)

[Question: Do You believe that Jesus Christ was killed for our sins, to help us?]

Yes, He suffered for us. He had to do that. But incarnations actually never suffer. He had to do it, which I will tell you later on, because the way He had to go through a center of Agnya, of optic chiasma was closed like this. So He had to get crucified for it. His message is His resurrection - not crucifixion, resurrection. But now we need not suffer. So those who say you must suffer, they're absolutely wrong. Are we going to suffer more than Christ?

[Question: How can we help the people who don't want to get realization, to get it?]

You can't. They can't. You cannot force it. Kundalini is the power of pure desire. If you do not have pure desire, I cannot surpass your freedom. It has to be a personality like a good seed which can be embedded in the Mother Earth. But you must have desire, otherwise it cannot be worked. You cannot force a seed to sprout. Now, this gentleman has a question.

[Question]

All right, that's a good question: that by raising the kundalini of others and also establishing yourself, you become a righteous person, and another also becomes the righteous person. They become really saintly people. They are peaceful, without any lust and greed. After all, this world is made by human beings, and if the human beings are transformed, the world will be transformed.

[Question]

I don't know what you are saying, I don't follow. You should not worry about Me. I will not tell you anything about Myself. Christ said that He was the Son of God, which He was. But He said that, so they crucified Him. People don't want to hear truth, unless and until they are realized souls. So I do not want to get crucified; I have to do My work still. And it is because I say you cannot take money, all these people who have made a business out of religion and business out of all this false guru propagation, they're all against Me. Also the religions have made a business, all the religions have made a business nowadays, so they don't like Me. You cannot make business out of God.

So now I think we'll have the session of Self-realization. For this again I have to say that I cannot force it on anyone whatsoever. Only those who want it and desire it should be in the hall. Otherwise they should leave the hall. (The whole thing starts shaking if you get up, even. ... Can't understand. Would you come from this side, I can't hear. ... You wanted that? See once, even when you come up, it shakes. When they get up, it shakes. So let it be ... The whole thing started shaking ... ) And those who do not want should not sit here, please.

So, at the very outset I have to again tell you that be fully confident that you all will get your realization. The second thing is, there are three conditions which you have to understand. The first condition is that you have to forget the past, and you are not to feel guilty at all. You are after all human beings, and if you have done any mistake it's all right, you are not God. But feeling guilty is some sort of a mental torture. But also when you feel guilty, this center here catches on the left-hand side, and you physically also torture yourself. Because when this center is caught up, then you get angina, spondylitis, all these diseases. So what's the use of feeling guilty? Please do not feel guilty. When I say don't feel guilty many people are leaving, because they want to feel guilty and get sick.

Now the third condition is that you should forgive everyone in general. Some people say it is very difficult, but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. Again, when you don't forgive, then you torture yourself for nothing at all. So you should not even think of people whom you are to forgive. Just say "I forgive everyone" and immediately you'll feel better. That's all.

Now to take the help of the Mother Earth, you have to take out your shoes, that's all. Please put your left and right foot away from each other. Just for about five, ten minutes, that's all. Now as he has told you, there are two powers, left and right, so ... (After, after, after the meditation, all right? Well, let him take one. All right, let him now. That's all. Sit down, sit down.) So put your left side on one side, and right side on another. Left side represents your desire power, and right side represents your action power. So please put your left hand on the left side, on the lap, and the right side we will use for nourishing our centers on the left-hand side. First we'll show you how to touch your different centers on the left-hand side, to nourish them, so please see first of all, and then we'll have to close the eyes. 

Put the right hand on your heart. This is the center where there's the reflection of God Almighty as spirit. And kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, the primordial Mother. Now, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. This is the center of your mastery. When you become the spirit, you become your own guide. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the center which is for pure knowledge, with which we work out all divine work. Then raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. Now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. This center you catch when you feel guilty. Now please take your hand on your forehead across, and bend your head as far as possible. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

Now please take your right hand to the back side of your head, and push back your head. This is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, for your satisfaction you have to say, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine Power. Now you have to stretch your palm. Now put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers, and put down your head as far as possible. So there is a good pressure on your scalp, push back your fingers. Put down your head. Now you move your scalp seven times clockwise, slowly. Put down your head. Now, that's all you have to do.

Now please put both your feet apart from each other, left hand towards Me, and do not sit too much bent down or forward, but comfortably. Now, please put your right hand on your heart. Left hand towards Me, on your lap. Now please close your eyes. Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question, three times - you can call Me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji" - "Mother, am I the spirit?" (Loudly.) 

If you are the spirit you become your guide, your master. So please take down your right hand on the left-hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part. We are working only on the left side. Here you have to ask another question, "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times. I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge on you, because I respect your freedom. You have to ask for it.

Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, and press it hard. Here you have to say six times, because this center has got six petals, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Six times. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the kundalini starts rising higher. 

So now we have to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence, ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

I've already told you that you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego or these conditionings, but you are pure spirit. So now raise your right hand onto your heart, and here you have to say with full confidence ten times - twelve times, "Mother, I am the spirit." Ten times - twelve times. 

This all-pervading Power is the power of compassion and love. It is ocean of absolute knowledge. (Loudly, loudly.) But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever mistakes you might commit, this ocean can dissolve it very easily. So please forgive yourself, and put your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. Here with full confidence say sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." 

I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything; but if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. So, now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across, and please put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say with full confidence - from your heart, not how many times - "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head, and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to say - from your heart, not how many times - "Oh divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me."

Now stretch your hand fully, your palm fully, and put the center of your palm on top of your head. Now push back your fingers. Please put down your head. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for your Self-realization. So move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise, asking, "Mother, please give me Self-realization" seven times.

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

Now please take down your hands. Please put both the hands towards Me like this. And now put the right hand towards Me like this. Please put right hand towards Me, and put down your head and see for yourself with the left hand, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. (Loudly, loudly, loudly.) If it is hot, means you have not forgiven, so please forgive and don't feel guilty.

Now left hand towards Me, but bend your head, bend your head. Now please see with your right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head, or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Don't put the hand on top of your head - away from it. Sometimes you get it far away. Now please put again your right hand. And put down your head and see for yourself again with the left hand.

Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky, like this. (Loudly, loudly.) And push back your head. And ask any one of these questions three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or "Mother, is this the power of divine love?" or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Ask any one of these questions, any one question three times.

Now take down your hands. Now put your hands like this towards Me. Open your eyes. Watch Me without thinking. Those who have felt cold or hot breeze on their fingertips or in their hands, or on the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

Prague! All of you have become saints now. I bow to you all! Your saintly life has started. Tomorrow I will come again and explain to you about the spirit. May God bless you. Please inform your friends and also call them, because I am here only for tomorrow. Those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze will settle down tomorrow, and those who have not felt at all will also feel it. 

May God bless you all.

(Also tell them not to talk about it. It is beyond your mind. To be quiet. Don't discuss it.)
