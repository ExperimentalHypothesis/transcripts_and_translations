保加利亚公开讲座

索非亚市

我向所有真理的追求者致敬。开首之先,我们要知道,真理是如其所如的。我们不能以思想达到它,不能将它概念化,我们要去经验它。你们可以感知到真理,即真实界。这是个十分混乱的时代,但只有在这时代,你才可找到真理。你们要是真理实相的追求者,因为这是为了你的好处,也是为了全世界的好处。我们已进化至人类的阶段,但我们有的不是绝对的知觉,而是相对的知觉。我们不知甚么是真理,甚么是真实,不知道为甚么生在世上。每个人,无论生在甚么国家,生来就有一种内在的信心,这是对上天或高于人类事物的信心。你们每人都有这种潜在的神性,不会因任何事物而改变,只会因你们的思想积习而掩蔽起来。

有许多事物打击你们的信心,首先是各种宗教,一个人不论相信任何宗教,都可以做罪恶的事,宗教成为思想的投射。而且现在的宗教,不是追求灵性,而是追求金钱的。这使人们怀疑那些开创宗教的人。那些先知和降世神祇都是百分之百真的,可是从孩提开始,我们便被错误的观念围绕,以致于迷失。好像耶稣基督,他的门徒走错了方向,那个保罗利用基督教,作为自己的台阶,他利用耶稣最弱的门徒彼得,耶稣早就说过彼得会听信撒旦的话。保罗和彼得二人迫害其他门徒,多玛逃到印度,马太则反击,而约翰则不肯交出他对耶稣的记载。有一点很简单,耶稣怎会叫彼得一人组织教会?保罗和彼得二人编纂圣经,加入错误的观念。我生长在基督教家庭,当我读圣经时,感到震惊,不知为何圣经里会有保罗此人。我问我父亲,他是个已得到自觉的灵,他说保罗是个破坏者。

保罗的第一个错误观念是原罪,人怎会有原罪?他自己曾参加婚礼,他要参予原罪吗?是否所有结婚的人,都犯了原罪?罗摩、克里希纳、穆罕默德、那纳克、老子都有结婚,他们是罪人吗?这是个绝对错误的假设。然后是那些教士,在加拿大,刚出版一部书揭露那些教士如何对儿童作性侵犯。耶稣说:「你们会喊叫:『耶稣!耶稣!』但我不认识你们。」这些人只是为了赚钱。有一次在海牙鲁鲁,我们刚主持完聚会回来,打开电视机看,我从未看过这样向人谄媚的节目。有个教士站在镜头前,拿着一百元钞票说:「捐出这一百元,神便会给你一切。」他说有位女士捐了一百元,这是卖念珠的钱。第二天,她门前放满了念珠,只有美国人才相信这些故事。印度的假导师也常常说这类故事,后来他们都说出这是假的。你们不要相信这些人,甚至传媒也是不可靠的,只要有人给他们钱,他们便会报导那个消息。这些站在假理一边的人,都害怕霎哈嘉瑜伽。他们不知道甚么对他们好,他们要知道,直至目前为止,他们仍未得到救赎,像他们那样做有甚么用?

耶稣说,你们要得到重生,但这不是要颁发给自己一张证书,便可得到重生。在梵文,得到重生的人叫 "Dijaha",与「鸟」是同一个字。鸟首先生而为蛋,然后重生为鸟,同样,我们生而为人,然后成为得到自觉的灵。我们不可称一只蛋为鸟,鸟有它的能力。这种神性在我们里面,这个力量在我们里面,你们不用花钱去买,也不能花钱去买,这是个进化的过程,是个活生生的过程。为甚么你们要认同于那些对你们没有任何好处的事物?

节目主持人刚才已介绍过人体内的能量系统,这就是耶稣说的生命树。但有许多圣经中没有记载,因为耶稣在世的日子很短,而且耶稣说的许多话,都经过保罗的删改。耶稣很清楚的说:你要知道你自己。我们知道自己的真我吗?耶稣说:你们不要有淫邪的眼睛,你们有纯真无邪的眼睛吗?如果没有,那就要知道我们还有所不足。现在的宗教都不是灵性取向的,他们时刻想着赚钱,而且还催眠人。

保罗开始的另一错误是要人忏悔,这使人受许多苦。有一次,一个在教会学校读书的女孩问我她有罪吗?我说没有。但女孩说学校要她忏悔,她怎样也想不出有甚么罪。所以我们要知道,耶稣所说的,并没有实现,我们仍要求得救赎。那是很容易的,要得到自觉,只要很短的时间。因为你们都有这个力量。

有样事情我觉得很奇怪,他们说有圣父圣子,但圣灵只是只白鸽。怎可能有父亲、儿子,却没有母亲?保罗是个憎恨女人的人,保罗提及耶稣母亲时,只说「那妇人」,从不称圣母。而有五任的教宗,都曾讨论玛利亚的罪,这是多么亵渎的事。他们怀疑童贞女受孕的可能,但这是神的事情,神可以作任何事,神不同于人。你们的心脏是如何会跳动的?看你们的眼睛,这都是奇迹的创造,看你们的大脑,好像是部计算机那样,这是由谁创造的呢?是全能的神。我们称神为全能的,却不明白祂能做任何事。在现代有种不同的环境,在印度我们称之为黑暗时代,即最恶劣的年代。在真理时代来临以前,还有一个过渡时期,此时无所不在的上天浩爱的力量会活跃起来。现在这个力量已经活跃起来,你们因此才能得到自觉。你们看见的这些神迹相片,全都是上天力量的工作。

甚么是真理?真理是这样的:你们不是这个身体,这个思维,这个自我或超我,你们都是永恒的灵。另一个真理是:有一个无所不在的上天浩爱的力量存在。看这些美丽的花朵,你们视之为理所当然。我们甚至不去想,这些事情是怎样发生的?是谁造就这生命的工作?是这无所不在的上天浩爱的力量。古代圣人已知有这个力量,并冠以不同名称,如圣灵的凉风。圣灵是甚么?圣灵是万物之母,在圣经有提及门徒感到圣灵的凉风,但却没有更进一步的记载。希腊人称她为阿西娜,那是万物之母的意思。要知道我们体内的灵量,便是圣灵的力量在我们体内的反映,而我们的灵,则是全能的神在我们体内的反映。你们首先要得到自觉,知道自己是谁,然后便会知道一切,就是如此而已。

这些都是内在于你们的,好像一颗种子,放在大地母亲之上,便会发芽成长一样。灵量升起以后,所有能量中心都会得到滋养。世界所有问题,都是由人类引起的。所有人类的问题,都是由这些能量中心引起的。如果你的能量中心良好,所有问题都能迎刃而解。首先你们的身体、精神和情绪都得到平衡。癌症和许多不治之症,都被霎哈嘉瑜伽治好了。在印度有三位医生,因研究用霎哈嘉瑜伽治疗不治之症,取得医学博士学位。印度的传媒十分明智,报章杂志都有大量篇幅报导霎哈嘉瑜伽。印度人很容易便能接受霎哈嘉瑜伽,因为在印度我们没有像弗罗伊德般的学者。最近我读一本关于弗罗伊德的书,这是完全错误的理论。过去二十年我不断这样说,现在有位医生指出,弗罗伊德的理论并无科学根据。但他的理论已对西方文化造成很坏的影响,已是无可弥补。我想他不知道有霎哈嘉瑜伽。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我们能超越所有愚蠢的事情。有人一夜之间,戒除了吸毒的习惯,恢复道德的生活。看这些人能唱印度歌曲,那是很难学的,特别是英国人,现在他们都唱得很好,很难想象这些人会变得这样有创造力。

我们要知道灵体的本质,永恒的灵是我们内在的普遍存有。唤醒灵体以后,你变成是普遍的存有。通过灵体之光你看见,所有宗教都是同一棵树的不同枝条,是同一棵树上的不同花朵。但人们摘下那些花朵,说这花是自己的。因为我们像圣雄甘地那样,相信所有宗教,那些宗教的教条主义者,便不喜欢我们,要加以打击。要小心他们,他们能收买传媒。我们要小心,耶稣的门徒也受过这样的苦。因为他们有真正的知识,他们被称为「真知派」(Gnostics)。Gna 这个字来自梵文,意即纯洁的知识。这个知识是内在于你们的,你们不需要甚么高级学位,因这些都是内在的。就好像你们能看见我坐在这里,你们能感知到这无所不在的力量。当灵体之光在你们注意力之中,这个能量便开始在你体内流通,你们便能感觉到这力量。你们不要问别人,你们自己便知道。你们可通过这些清凉的能量,知道甚么是真是假、是对是错。你们不用盲目相信任何事情,只要张开双手,问:「有神没有?」便可感到手掌上的凉风。你们可问:「耶稣基督是上帝的儿子吗?」便可感到掌上的凉风。如果你们问希特勒或斯大林,便会感到热力,甚至儿童也可做到。

由此你们便可知道绝对的真理,这不是相对的。每个人都知觉同样的事情,这样便没有争斗和战争。首先发生的是,你们进入现在此刻。你们一直生活在将来或是过去,由于灵量升起,你们进入了现在,完全没有杂念,你们在平安之中。这个境界叫无思虑的入静状态,是很容易达到的。只有在这种状态,你们才能生长。第二阶段你完全没有了疑惑,对自己没有疑惑,对无所不在的力量亦无疑惑。但这不只是在思想上的,你们能提升别人的灵量,这样一个人便能让千万人得到自觉,你们能医治别人,你们能解决许多问题,变得很有活力,同时很有爱心。当你们的注意力改变你们的眼睛,你们便具有耶稣所说的纯真的眼睛,没有贪婪。无论你把注意力放在那里,都能发生作用。你们变得很有力量,你们可控制雨水和周围的环境。但最重要的是你们变得正直,不会自我中心。灵体可给你无限的满足感,你们知道绝对的真理,你们的注意力受到启发。第三是你们进入了喜乐的海洋,喜乐没有二重性,快乐或不快乐,而是一种状态。你能静观整出世界的戏剧,你能享受你自己,享受其他人。所有不幸都完结了,这是一早答应过的,你们会进入上帝的国。

现在这时候来临了,你们生长在这个时代很幸运。现代有那么多真理的追求者,英国诗人威廉‧布莱克曾经说,神的子民有朝一日会生在世上,令自己变得神圣,令他人也变得神圣。这不是一次演讲,你们要明白,这是你们自己的力量。为甚么不这样做,这是你们自己的,有甚么害处?这是人类觉醒最伟大的时代,你们都要进入这个时代。我很简单的向你们解释,因为我只留一天的时间。

但不会在美国,他们都很愚蠢,他们有太多的钱孝敬假导师,他们吸食药物,或染上自毁的习惯。我很高兴来到这里,明年我还会再来。但你们要明白,霎哈嘉瑜伽不是一个人练的,当然你们要在家里静坐,但你们还要参加集体。你们便变成是整体的一个部分,好像身体某部分有问题,整个身体都会帮助它。在世界任何一个地方,只要有霎哈嘉瑜伽的修习者,都是你的弟兄姊妹,他们是你真正的兄弟姊妹。你有甚么问题,他们都会跑来帮助你。记得我初到俄国时,那里有廿五个德国来的霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者,我问他们为甚么来到这里?他们含着泪说:「难道你还不明白么?我们要补偿祖先犯下的过错。」这些德国人变成是最温文的人,他们变得很有爱心,他们从石头变成发出芳香的莲花。这是他们内在的美丽。你们只需要对自己有一点耐心,现在我们开始作静坐冥想,大概需要十至十五分钟的时间,这样你便能进入上帝的国。

那些不想得到自觉的人,现在应离开礼堂。因为我们不能勉强别人得到自觉,我们尊重人的自由。你们要自己要求得到,要求得到上天的知识和得到自觉。

There are three conditions, which are very simple. The first one is that you all have to have complete confidence in yourself that today you are going to get your Self Realization. Secondly you have to have full understanding that this All Pervading Power is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by the Ocean of Forgiveness. So please forgive yourself, forget your past and know that you are no more a sinner. Have full faith in yourself. In short, you have to be placed very pleasantly towards yourself. Thirdly you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them. You may say that is difficult but logically if you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are very happy while you are the one who's suffering.

Moreover the center, which is formed by the optic chiasm, is like this, very, very constricted. This center can only open like this if you forgive everyone. Otherwise you will miss because Kundalini won't rise. So please forgive everyone without thinking about them because it's a headache to think of them. I hope you will forgive, you'll feel much lighter. These are the only three conditions. I would request people sitting on the chairs can remove their shoes and also those who are sitting on the ground please remove your chairs. Because this Mother Earth helps us a lot, She sucks in our problems. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right but those who are sitting on the chairs have to put their both the feet on both the sides because there are two powers, left and right. The left power is the power of ordinary human desire and the right is the power of action. But the Kundalini, which is your Mother, individual Mother, is the power of pure desire. So please have the pure desire in your heart that you should get your Realization. So now you have to put your left hand towards Me like this, which is very symbolic that you want your Self Realization and with the right hand you have to nourish your centers on the left hand side. This only you have to do today, not all the time. So before you close your eyes we'll tell you how you will nourish your centers.

So please put you left hand towards Me like that, comfortably and put your right hand on your heart. Everybody should do it. Those who don't want to do it should go away and not watch other people, it's not very civil. If you don't do it you will not get your Self Realization and why miss it? For what? When you are entitled. Please sit down, please be seated. Better sit down, be comfortable. In the heart resides the Spirit. If you are the Spirit then you are your guide, your own master. So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center for your mastery. This is created by great prophets within you. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge, the divine knowledge. Take back your hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen, then on your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the center you catch when you feel guilty. But with this you get diseases like angina, spondylitis and lethargic organs.

Then you have to take your right hand and put it across on your forehead like this and now please put down your head. This is the center where you have to forgive others. Take back this right hand now to the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Now the last center is important. Stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm just on top of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone. Now push back your fingers and put down your head. This you have to move round your scalp, pressurizing, scalp, seven times clock-wise. Push back your fingers, push back... Seven times. Please do it otherwise you won't get your Realization. You see, if you make fun, you'll be left behind. If you have come here to make fun you better go away. Stupid people cannot get Sahaja Yoga, anything. That's it. Now that's all we have to do. These two ladies should be asked to go because they are all the time troubling. They have no brains, I think.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this and have your self esteem that you are all going to get your Realization. Please put your right hand on your heart. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself. You may call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Please [UNCLEAR] put your both feet away from each other, those who are sitting on the chairs. You can take out your spectacles because you'll have to close your eyes and please don't open them till I tell you.

Now, the first question is: "Mother am I the Spirit?" Please close your eyes now and ask a question: "Mother am I the Spirit?", three times. If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So now please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you have to ask another fundamental question, three times "Mother...." Please keep your eyes shut. Here ask a question again three times: "Mother am I my own master?" I've already told you that I respect your freedom and the pure knowledge, the divine knowledge cannot be forced on you. So now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. Here you have to say six times because this center has got six petals: "Mother please give me pure knowledge." Now raise your right hand again on to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini has started rising. So you have to now nourish your upper centers with your self-confidence. At this point you have to say ten times with full confidence: "Mother I am my own master". Now, raise ten times left side, ten times.

I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings and ego but you are pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say with full confidence, twelve times: "Mother I am the pure Spirit". This All Pervading Power is the Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean of Compassion and Ocean of Joy but above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness and you cannot commit any mistake, which cannot be dissolved by the Power of this Ocean of Forgiveness. So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here, with full confidence you have to say sixteen times: "Mother I'm not guilty at all". I've already told you that if you do not forgive your Agnya chakra won't open out and logically it makes no difference whether you forgive or don't forgive. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head, fully. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." You do not have to think of them at all, just say it from your heart: "Mother I forgive them fully".

Now take back your hand, back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say, again from your heart, not how many times: "Oh, Divine Power, if I have done any mistake, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me". Please do not count your mistakes. Now just stretch your palm nicely, put your right hand on top of your head and push back your fingers. Please put down your head. Now please push back your fingers, very important. And now move your scalp seven times, but you have to know one thing that I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it, you have to ask for it. So now move your scalp seven times, saying: "Mother please give me Self Realization". Press it hard.

Now please take down your hands. Please put both your hands towards Me like this. Now don't think, you can do it. Please don't think. Now put the right hand like this towards Me, bend your heads and see with your left hand if you are feeling the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area. It could be also hot, hot breeze if you have not forgiven, but you can feel it. Now please put your left hand towards Me and bend your head and see. [UNCLEAR] Some people get it far, some people get it nearer. Then again put your right hand towards Me and see with left hand if there's a cool breeze or a hot air. Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head and now ask a question, anyone of these questions three times: "Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? or "Mother is this the All Pervading Power of God's Love?" or "Mother is this the Paramachaitanya?" Please ask three times from your heart anyone of these questions. Now please bring it down, put your hands [UNCLEAR]. You'll fell very peaceful and pleased. Don't think about it. It's beyond mental, it is beyond mental.

All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze in their hands, fingers or out of their fontanel bone area please raise your both the hands. Again, loudly. Oh, the whole of Bulgaria! I bow to all of you. Your saintly life has started. Have respect for yourself and for your Self Realization. Please, remember that you have to come to the collective to grow. You don't have to pay for it. In your own right you have got your Realization. So please respect it and grow. Your problems will be solved like miracles. May God bless you! (That's all right. Everyone got it. They are all in silence.) Next year again I'll be here. We have to just know what we are now and you'll enjoy your own glory and your own beauty. Now to protect yourself only you put your left hand like this and move your right hand like this, every morning like this, three times. Just to protect, from negative forces. And now enjoy yourself.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
