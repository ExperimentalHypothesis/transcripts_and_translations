Vishuddhi Chakra, Delhi (India), Public Programme, 2 February 1983.

The prophets are born and create a ripple in our consciousness, a new dimension to our understanding to religion, dharma; which has to be assimilated and has to be understood that, whatever the previous prophets have said, has to be culminated into something else.

So, as we can say Mohammed Sahib has said that all these Prophets who have come on this earth have created a new ripple and also has sustained human beings with a newer evolution, a newer foliage opening into them. The idea of human beings of newness is that we have to give up all that is old and we have to become new. Or they think that newness means absolutely a juxtaposition condition in which one has to rise: and this is the cause of the folly of many people in the West as well as in the East. Whenever a new theme started. Like, we can say that, first of all a great saint came on this earth and he found that the people are following the idol worship in a very wrong way.

Because it is said in The Bible that: whatever is created by Mother Earth should not be reproduced and worshipped. So they created another extreme religion out of it saying that nothing should be worshipped!! But it is said, ‘Whatever is reproduced by the Mother Earth.” So there are so many such things all over the world which are created by the Mother Earth. So they should not be worshipped by reproducing them and making images out of them. When such a prophet died saying that, “This should not be done, one should not worship images,” the other side of it started – the extreme! Going to the extreme that there should be no worship even if the Mother Earth has created. So, all the human beings were divided into [different] extreme conditions. One situation comes in where one has to say that, “This should not be done,” so people take up that theme and just start building up onto that and saying that, “This should not be done as told by the prophet.” Of course, [only] after the death of the prophet! When the prophet is living nobody listens to him! They all torture him, bother him, do all kinds of things and ultimately they may even kill him.

Then another point is: every prophet is born at a different period of time. So, depending on the time when he is born, he talks of a particular problem. Say, when Mohammed was born. Mohammed Sahib said very clearly that, “You should not drink.” So people said that, “Alright, we will not drink, but we can smoke!” So he had to rectify himself. He’d said, “I am the last who has come,” but He found that it is not so. So He came back again as Nanaka to tell people that – do not smoke also!

Like that, the persons, or the group of persons, who follow one incarnation, go to another extreme, and try to push down all the traditions [of] all that has come so far, built up. Like cutting the whole tree and [then to] start their own tree, which is artificial. Then the quarrel started when Mohammed Sahib was driven to another level and then Nanaka’s disciples were driven to another level where they just thought they have no relationship with each other, which is not Truth.

Afterwards also, you know, so many such things have happened in this world. We can see that [when] any revival starts, people go to the extreme of it and get completely ruined. In Christianity you will find the same thing happened. When Christ came in, whatever problems He faced He talked about them. But the main thing He had to talk about [was] the resurrection, about the ascent. And He talked about the ascent. He talked about the Spirit and in His resurrection He showed that He ascended. But people did not stick to that point. They never thought that you have to ascend in Christianity. Nobody bothered that you have to ascend. They took small little things from somewhere. Also a person came later on called ‘Saint’ Paul who was not at all with Christ or anything. He started a religion of Christianity which was all absurd, against Christ, anti-Christ.

None of these Prophets have discarded any Prophet who came before them. Now the problem came in that one has to integrate and Mohammed Sahib knew that a day will come when this integration problem will start and he talked a lot about Sahaja Yoga in the sense he said when the resurrection time will come. He talked more about resurrection than about doom time, most surprising thing is. About Qiyamah He spoke very little. He spoke really about the resurrection time, because that was the problem. The problem that they face they talk about. I’ve told you how Buddha talked only about Atma Sakshatkar (Self-realisation) and not about God. Because those people who went to God, or thought of God, or just studied God thought they will be gods themselves! So he said, “You must get your Self-realisation.” Then Mahavira who talked about the hell where people can go, because that was his job, the part of it and the part of it and the part of it and the part of it. These are the different aspects of human beings which they had to awaken; different aspects.

When Mohammed Sahib started teaching people to do namaz people used to laugh at him. “What is he doing? Why does he want us to put hands like this? Why does he want us to sit down or put our hands on the knees?” Now you understand as Sahaja Yogis what it means: that he wanted us to improve our Nabhis first, our dharma first. All this movement was to jerk out the Kundalini. But without Realisation being there namaz would not work out, you may break your knees you may do what you like! But the extremes people catch hold of it and not the reality. And they make a fuss out of it and they make create a big organisations and things and that’s how it is spoiled. So when he said that Allah ho Akbar is to be said with your fingers in your ears, you all say that isn’t it? All the Sahaja Yogis say with this finger in their ears, “Allah ho Akbar!” Because you know this is the finger that represents the Vishuddhi and the Vishuddhi Chakra’s deity, Shri Krishna, becomes the Viraata with Akbar. So, when you say about Akbar, you have to put your fingers into your ears and you have to say, “Allah ho Akbar!”

The whole relationship and everything was never understood. For Indians Shri Krishna was their Omkara, for Western people Christ was theirOmkara, for other people of Arabistan, Mohammed was their Omkara. How can that be? They are all related to each other. So, how to relate to each other is a problem of Sahaja Yoga. When they come from different communities and different fixed ideas it’s impossible to stir them and tell them that: you are all one! We talk of Hindu Muslim unity for example. Mohammed Sahib didn’t know there were problems like that, but [Guru] Nanaka did say we have come to do Hindu Muslim unity. But in the outside if you do the Hindu Muslim unity or any unity, it doesn’t work out. It doesn’t work out in the outside relationship. Even your brother may not be your own brother, if it is working outside. But if the Spirit is awakened within you, then Spirit is the one which is the connection with the Whole, with the Viraata, with the Akbar. When Akbar is to be felt you have to have your Realisation, otherwise you are just talking in the air; you don’t know Who is this Akbar. You have to get connected to that Viraata and that Viraata is the Primordial Being.

We are actually not integrated at all because we have different incarnations. Even if you are not absolutely atheist, even if you don’t say that you do not believe in God, or believe in something else which is anti-God, even if you believe in God, you believe in God in fragmentations, in His different aspects, but you don’t see Him in collectivity. You have to see that He is one God. Everybody says He is one God. Of course He is one God. I am one person but I am also a housewife, I have to do some work for My household, I am also a sister of somebody, I am also your Mother and mother of My own children and also a grandmother. So I have so many various aspects of My work which I do. One person has to do it. When we talk of God as One, we think He is [like the] Rock of Gibraltar – just one piece. Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you go and see it, is not one piece. Anything in this world you cannot say is one piece. It has to be a compound or a mixture of something. Then how can God be just one piece hanging in the air like one?“God is One, so we’ll not have any other aspect of God.” God has many aspects, which one has to understand.

So there are two concepts which work out in this world I feel: one is that they believe that there is only one God and there cannot be many aspects of God , which is wrong. Christ has said, “Those who are not against Me are with Me.” So this kind of a mental conception about God, that He is just like Rock of Gibraltar. See now this pandal (meaning: an Indian marquee with open sides to shade from the sun) you have done it: There are so many lights. They are all giving one light to all of us. They are not giving separate lights are they? How are they fighting with each other? What is the fight going on? They are adding to the same light. This is one pandal but we have so many lights. We cannot do with one light.

At different periods a person has to be born. Every period a person had to be born to enlighten one aspect of human awareness and consciousness. Variety has to be there because human beings are varied. And the variety is that, supposing you are supporting somebody’s right-sidedness, then there should be somebody who will come and support the left-sidedness. And it is all done so well within us. But it is only human beings in their obstinacy and in their ignorance cannot see it. We all are made the same way if you see in the whole world. Of course there is variety in appearances. Maybe an Indian looks like an Indian and...but in India only you can see Indians have so many different faces. You can find all colours and all kinds of things on their faces. In India is the only place where you find all kinds of people. You can have people like Russians, you can have people like Japanese, Chinese. You can have people like Africans. All kinds of people are in this country to show that all people can be called as one race, as Indians.

Now it is not always ignorance that makes people forget that we are all one. Every human being laughs the same way. Does he laugh in a different way? If he has to eat the food he masticates the same way. He cries the same way. When he cries his crying is the same. His actions are the same way. If a woman is angry with her husband...yesterday I saw [unclear] program with My brother and I was amazed how universal we are in our expressions. He was showing how a woman gets angry with the husband and how she behaves. If you see those actions which are depicted you’ll be amazed that they are done by all the women all over the world. And the reaction of man if you want to see – all the men act in the same way.

My husband was secretary to Shastriji [Prime Minister of India 1964-66]. You know that and he went with Lal Bahadur Shastri to Tashkent at his last time. But also he went once to Yugoslavia and there...(aside: who was General Tito was where? Yugoslav)...and General Tito’s wife, you see, got very friendly with Mrs. Shastri. Both were very friendly. So Shastriji warned his wife, “See now! You are great friends and now don’t start crying like an Indian woman when you leave.” So, poor thing was controlling her tears all the time. But she told Me, “I was controlling but it is she who started crying and such a lot! And then she started crying loudly, hugging me. So I just could not control myself. I also gave in. I also started crying.” And both the husbands started looking at the ground! So basically all the women, all the men, in the whole world, react the same way to a situation. And you can see their reactions very clearly when it comes to children. They all act in the same way, act in the same manner. Supposing they hear that two children are caught up in the air somewhere, or something is happening to them – the whole world will be worried about how they are going to be saved. “Something must be done to save them.” The whole world will be praying to God, “Oh God please save these two children are caught up there somehow or other.” Everybody will be worried as if their own child is there. Even when it comes to death I have seen that.

When there was a air space, the space craft (Apollo 13) was going to land and people were worried that they may be lost. I know in every masjid (mosque), in every temple, in every church and everywhere...they were Americans [but] nobody thought of Americans, what religion, anything. To them it was a part of human beings, you see. The human bondage started acting. That time they never thought what country they were, what Americans have done to Indians, nothing of the kind! They just thought, “Oh God! These people are...oh God please save them.” Everybody prayed to God and prayed for them that they should be saved. [At] that time, what had happened to us? How did we forget? We touched to the Reality at that time and that is what it is. Anybody who tries...these Jews when they were troubled by Hitler – everybody’s sympathies were with them. But when these Jews started troubling the Muslims there everybody’s sympathies were with Muslims. Then why don’t you think all religions? Even the Jews had sympathies with Muslims. Then we don’t think what differences we have with them. None of them, none of the people I heard, said, “Alright, they are punished,” or, “It’s alright.” Not even Jews!

So the part that is within us, which is human, becomes absolutely troubled when we see some other human being is tortured. Of course, by with these horrible ideas of fanaticism or maybe fear or maybe aggressiveness or whatever it is, we may try to be cruel. If you ask the people of Germany, “how do they feel about the massacre?” they just put down their heads. They said, “We don’t know. We were not ourselves. How we did it we don’t know. How it happened we just don’t know how it worked out.” So when the violence is over you just start feeling, “Oh God, I am a human being, they were human beings.” So this oneness comes in. The feeling the awareness comes in. It is not so in the animals so much. If they have to work, if they are to be active, they will be together but if something dies they are not bothered. Even if a child, say, of a monkey is sick, the mother will be worried. She’ll be screaming, shouting; but if the thing is dead she will just throw away the child on one side and get up. It’s only the human beings who can feel that oneness. So our awareness... this was given to us by Shri Krishna’s advent. He gave us this awareness of human, or He keeps that awareness within us. We have to accept Him as a Person who gives us this awareness of human relationship. And whenever there has been problem like somebody told Me that in Somnath people believe that Shri Krishna came as to give lessons. So many Hindus believe it was Shri Krishna who came as Mohammed Ghazni to give a lesson to these horrible brahmins who were making money out of that temple. So many Hindus believe that, that to punish these horrible brahmins who were making money, he had to come as Mohammed Ghazni to break that idol which was giving them so much money and they were making all kinds of, you can say, extractions, from the poor devotees who were devoted to that temple. It was only He could do it.

So we have to understand that when we are not integrated, we cannot feel the integration of our being. We are not integrated – that we have to realise. Our mind works in one way, our heart works in another way, our liver works in another way. As I told you I am quite surprised that when they have told that, “don’t drink,” those people who follow these religions still go on drinking. But apart from that, religion forget it, [if] they see a man going into a pub and falling and faltering coming out, still they enter into the same to get to the same situation! Why? Because the mind tells them not to do it; mind says, “Don’t go!” the brain says, “Don’t go!” but their heart is weak – they cannot. The habits, all the habits come through this kind of disintegration.

We are so disintegrated within ourselves that if a person wants to do something he just does the opposite of it! And that is the reason why we accept this kind of juxtapositions in life [like with] what was told by Him about music and about everything.. Music has come out of God’s love to us. Anything that is not for God’s love is not music. I will give you an example. There was a lady who used to do some sort of a Qawali and I was on the censor board. I censored her Qawalis and I said, “This is not a Qawali.” She said, “Why?” I said, “This is called as mujarat. This is horribly sensuous and horrible thing. It’s an insult of God. You can’t sing like that.” So she said, “No, this is Qawali.” I said, “Do you know Qawali was never sung by women and was never done in this dirty fashion the way like a prostitute you are singing this Qawali? It’s always all the music was in the praise of God. And that’s why Mohammed Sahib said that all the music should be in the praise of God and should not be...”

So we had other things like Ras and all that. But you find even at the time of Shri Krishna all the music was to be just done for Ras. Ra, ‘Ra’ is ‘energy’. Sa means ‘with’. With Radha they were playing together, playing Rasa and that’s how they were doing the circulation of the energy to integrate themselves and singing the music. It is for that but you find that people don’t understand. They use music for sensuousness: is anti-God. This music force has come to us to praise God, that’s all, for nothing else, [not] for doing all kinds of dirty things and singing all kinds of funny things. Imagine! And the reaction is built in so much. When He said that all the music should be in the name of God, we have a person like Aurangzeb who would not take to any music! He was such a staunchy (sic) fellow and the other Muslims who came in would not sing anything that is Qawali or anything, would sing horrible ghazals which are just describing the separation of a woman and a man and all kinds of dirty things!

With this disintegrated temperaments people took to anything that came to them just to please themselves. When the advent of this thing like Omar Khayam. Who is he? He’s anti-God absolutely anti-God man. Horrible! But people appreciate him very much, Omar Khayam what a poetry it is. They appreciate – why? Because the disintegrated part of their heart likes Omar Khayam when he sings, “Oh we should drink here. What is there in this life? We don’t know what is going to be there.” Because Mohammed Sahib has said not to drink, he must sing such a song. This is the poetry of Mr. Omar Khayam, who is being very much respected everywhere. And he’s very much regarded as a great poet in Iraq where today Khomeini is one great horrible man is born and he still respects this Omar Khayam; I don’t know how can he respect him. What a contrast it is, just see, what a contrast this Omar Khayam singing dirty songs. They are not in praise of God. Music which is not in the praise of God is not music. Is ashleed. Is filth. Is dirt. Our classical music in India was based on AUM. Even at Kundalini when it reaches here at the Vishuddhi Chakra it makes all the sounds, “am, aam, em, eem, um, oom, rim, reem, lrim, lreem, aye, ayee, ao, aou, ang, ah” All these sixteen vowels are coming from the sixteen chakras or the sub-chakras or the petals of this Vishuddhi Chakra. These are Bija mantras of the Vishuddhi Chakra. All the vowels come from here and when we sing dirty songs we spoil this chakra Vishuddhi.

That’s why all the people who sing these dirty songs have to take to drinking, because I think they can’t bear, or they can’t do it, they can’t sing these bad songs unless and until they take to some sort of an escape from God. So music and drinking started going hand in hand. In the West the music broke all its traditions because they had no sense left in them to recognise that music is meant only for God. Only for hymns to be sung in the praise of God. All music should be in the praise of God. All ragas should be in the praise of God. [In India] we had no namaz system of different times, but we have a system of music in different times. At different time, a certain music should be played where you describe a mood. And all the moods that are described have to relate themselves to God. There is no other mood that is enjoyable to the Spirit that does not relate to God. There’s no mood which one can enjoy. Even bibhatsa, the mood of bibhatsa is grotesque; even that mood one enjoyed, one can listen to when they see the filth and dirt, the left side.

It’s so scientific; our music system is extremely scientific because it was taken in the form of this music with actually the Kundalini moving into different these sapta swaras (meaning: 7 notes). These seven swaras are built in our seven chakras: It start with sa, then, re, ga, ma – Mother, pa, dha, ni. My name also starts with ni. These seven swaras are built in with seven notes and there are vrikrutis, vrikrut swaras, which are the other, what you call, chakras [so] that we have to make about twelve swaras. But nobody understood the real meaning of music.

Sharada the Goddess of Saraswati is the one who carries the message of Viraata within and tells us how to sing. She tells us what is appealing to God. How these ragas were made also? Just think of it. Because first they chose the notes the aroha and avrohas, the going up and down (ascending melody and descending melody), which was appealing to God. So the melodies were created. Melodies are fixed. You cannot change the melodies the notes because they found out that, at this point, the Spirit awakened; on the vibrations they found out. They found out that, when they sang this way it worked out. The Veena (primordial instrument of Shri Saraswati) they played and they found out the exact swaras. Exact swaras which would really make you feel nice. Now, you know that, those people have come from the West, don’t understand any Indian music on the mental level but they understand at the Spiritual level because their Spirits get filled with joy and the vibrations starts flowing.

The sense of music – this depiction of music was done by Shri Krishna. It is He the One who taught taala. Of course we can say that Shiva is the One who dances the taala, but the One who depicted it for human beings who gave the message to the world how the taala should be is Shri Krishna, through His dancing movements. He kept the taala all the time. Like the way He stands itself suggests how He kept the taala. And He played the murli (flute) also, to suggest that music is what God’s love is. His music is suggesting of God’s love, that soothes you, that clears you, that makes you happy, that gives you joy. And that’s what He suggested through His singing, through His music. He never wrote any poetry did He? He never wrote any poetry as such but when He spoke, when He spoke in gudria in the prose it became Gita. Just when He spoke it became Gita. Of course, people have tried to spoil quite a lot of it, the rhythm, which I feel sometimes when people recite it. But still we must say when He really created it, it was for human beings to create poetry out of prose. Out of prose He made it communicable. Because people could, first, only understand the music, the rhythm of the music. They didn’t understand much words and things. But He made it possible.

Even in Koran, if you read, the few words before starting every chapter nobody understands. They are all nothing but mantra bijas. But they put it there. They knew people won’t understand, but He put it there because people would understand. All these things you may not understand. You may not understand Me either, possibly, but whatever they did was for your hitha (benevolence). This is what happened, at the time of Shri Krishna that He established the concept of hitha; because it was said that you must speak the Truth and you must speak the thing that is sweet, priya (‘satyam vade, priyam vade’). It was the message of Shri Krishna that you must speak sweetly. Those people who have got a proper Vishuddhi Chakra speak very sweetly. Their voice has that enchanting method of capturing the hearts of people and not debasing them, but elevating them. So He said you must do it sweetly. That was His main theme. Everything He did so sweetly that He created a leela out of His doings. It was a leela that he made. He said this world is not a place where you should be serious, you should be sharp, you should be tense, but it’s a leela. Just see the leela, the drama. The whole is a drama.

So the whole thing is very sweet. If you see the whole world as a drama it becomes a sweet thing. The sweetness of it, even if you see a person trying to be funny, you get a joy out of it. If you know it’s a drama you don’t get worried if somebody comes and murders somebody and you know it’s all fake, it’s a drama. It’s a drama going on and that’s what He told people that the whole thing is a leela. So that people should not get into serious moods and actually start acting in the drama in the real way. Like, you see, you appoint somebody as, say, Shivaji Maharaj and there is somebody coming from the other side and he takes a sword and he really hits the fellow there! And you say this Shivaji Maharaj actor is no good; he gets absolutely involved into the thing and hits the other person. So it’s a drama and He made it into a leela – leela – because it’s a drama no doubt.

But when, when you get Realised, you start seeing the drama and the play and the whole thing is, you must have seen that most of the Sahaja Yogis are always laughing, because they see the way things are happening. Even when they see a guru misbehaving or something they just feel like laughing – how absurd it is. Like somebody came today to talk to Me and he told Me, “Mother, I have been to all kinds of nonsensical things.” And he was just laughing. He said, “I laugh at them now what I did.” He said, “I went to one guru who is going to – who used to give name to people; say this naama (name/mantra), that naam. I made such efforts, I went to people, recommended my case.” Because he was not so rich, you see, so he was never bought the name and he was saying, “give me the name. I must have the name.” And the guru was saying; “No, no, no, no. You have to wait three...”He said, “I poured so much money in his savapati and which were large savapatis were put. I did everything, but he would not give me a name and ultimately when it came to that he said, “Alright I’ll give you a name,” and he gave me a name which I started taking. I really became mad after that. I started getting headaches, this, that! Then he said; “Alright you have to suffer! If you don’t suffer you must go through it. Yes you must. You asked for the name so you have it.” And when he came to Me, he was looking like nothing on Earth, I tell you. In a very funny shape he came to Me. But now he’s completely cured. I could not even recognise him the other day I just saw him. I said, “Oh God are you the same person?” So he said, “Mother now I laugh at all these things and I just see that how people are stupid to go to these false people, follow false ideas and false conceptions and how they are missing the point.” And he asked Me a question, “Have they to go to that limit of destruction to come to You?” I said, “I don’t know about them what they have decided.” But it is true that people are so stupid that they take to all these ideas and all these negative things much more easily than to the positive things – because of the Vishuddhi Chakra being spoilt.

If your Vishuddhi Chakra is not spoilt, your hands are working better. Many people who get Realisation do not feel vibrations in the hands, because their Vishuddhi Chakras are not alright. Now what does that mean that your Vishuddhi Chakra is not alright? First of all by temperament you are not a collective person – by temperament. You are not a person who enjoys collectivity much. Like people who are fussy. “I want this. I want that. I want to sleep on a proper bed. I must have this. I must do that.” This kind of an ‘I’; those who have too much ‘I’ in them because both the ego and super-ego start from this Vishuddhi Chakra. You see a man who is an egoistical person is not able to see the collectivity at all, because he is separated with the rest of them. His ahamkara (ego) covers his being so much that he cannot enjoy the collectivity.

Now you see Shri Krishna lived with whom? With gopis who were little, little boys. He went and used to look after His cows; just looking after the cows. None of these incarnations you will find were interested in rich people or anything. He went and stayed with people who were very ordinary from the worldly point of view and there He played and there He did all these tricks of sweetness. He used to steal the butter. He used to steal the butter, and many people who are criticising Him always say, “Oh He was a thief. Yes He was a thief. He was the thief of the thieves.” And so on. He used to steal the butter because this butter was taken to Mathura by these ladies to get some money. And that was giving more help to all these horrible rakshasas who were in Mathura, so He didn’t want this to go there and give them this good health. The best thing was to steal the butter so they don’t get it and they starve on their- they have their deficiencies of the vitamin A and D, you can call it. And that they suffer from bad throat and they have no strength in their hands when they pick up their swords. So this was the way to hit them so that they could not fight the forces of good.

So, in that, He proved that a higher goal is to be achieved by giving up smaller, silly, stupid goals. The 'hitha', 'hitha' is the main thing, because when He said that, “You don’t speak the truth, otherwise people will be hurt.” All right, so what should you do? You hurt the people so you don’t speak the truth, or you speak the truth you hurt the people. So both cannot go together. Like if I tell somebody, “Oh you are so bad.” That person gets hurt. Now if I don’t tell that person, that person is lost. So what to do? He found out the solution so He said, He put, the word in between as ‘hitha’. The word ‘hitha’ means – good to your Spirit, whatever is good for your Spirit. Hitha word means – good for your Spirit. It has nothing to do with material things. It means for your Spirit. For example, if I tell somebody that, “You should not do that”, he may feel bad today, but if he recognises that, “Mother is telling me for my good,” he will do it and he will gain by that in his hitha. Or else if he does not do it, later on – supposing I don’t tell him and if he doesn’t know about it, or even if I tell him [and] he does not do it – he is going to feel bad. So it is not priya (pleasing) to his Spirit. It is not priya to him.

So if you do something that is the hitha of a person, sometimes you have to tell a person, sometimes it may look very, very painful. The other day I told somebody that, “you don’t cure anybody because you’re not strong enough to cure.” He felt very hurt. So then I’ll say, “All right go ahead. You better cure others, but don’t come back to Me.” Then he’ll land up in a lunatic asylum. But when he’ll land up in the lunatic asylum then what will he say? Was that for his hitha that I said? Will he be then angry? So ultimately if you say the hitha, say. Saying is the point. Not doing, saying. You say the hithawith your Vishuddhi Chakra then ultimately it becomes priya (pleasing). Means it is light. So you say a thing which is good for the Spirit, otherwise you just don’t say. But people just say to others to correct them because they are aggressive. It should be done in love. Hitha means: done something in love. If you want to say something to someone in love and you feel it is necessary and the third condition you must have adikar: you must have the right to say it to the person. If you don’t have the right you just keep quiet. Let God look after. You are not in charge of anyone. But if you have to say to someone in love and if you have an adikara then you have to say it. If you don’t have the adikar you should not say anything to anyone unless and until it is absolutely priya to that person involving his hitha. This is what He put, that you should not do any anadikar cheshta. Means you should not do something unauthorised.

Like, I would say, somebody comes to Me and says that, “Where is that person whom I want to murder?” Then what is the truth? Should I tell him, “Alright this is the truth. You go and kill that person”? According to the strict government law it may be. I don’t know if it is. I don’t understand the government laws at all, or the human laws. But it is not. Then what do you have to tell him? You just keep quiet. He has no adikar, he has no right, to ask you or to get this information from you. You just keep quiet. I do. Then he may beat you – do anything. You just say, “I don’t know.” It is anadikarcheshta. It is done many a times. People who are, say, great nationalists who fight for their country and people want to extract information from them. They suffer. Suffer. But they will not give the information. Not out of fear, but out of love of their fellow men who are fighting for the freedom of their country. This has been done in our country many a times. So you don’t speak something which is not the adikara of another. He has no right to ask this question. Like that, one has to be very discreet and that is what Shri Krishna has given us – His discretion.

Many people ask Me, “Mother, then in this situation, what should I do? In that situation what should I do?” That means the person has not developed a Vishuddhi Chakra to be discreet: he has not evolved, he is not mature enough, he is still asking Me questions. In the nirvikalpa state, you don’t ask Me any questions, you know exactly what is to be done: when to shout at somebody, when to be quiet, when to be silent, when to say something and how far to go. All these qualities develop through proper Vishuddhi Chakra, because you are doing it for the hitha of another person. Sometimes it pays much more to keep quiet. This is what He has taught us. Not only taught us but He has put it within us the discretion part in our Vishuddhi Chakra. He has put within us the power to witness the drama, to be detached. He was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara. He was the Ishwara of yoga. He was the One who was the giver of yoga – naturally – because Shiva is the One to be achieved. But the One who helps us is Him, Is Akbar, is the Mahalakshmi Tattwa, is the central path which takes you to Shiva. So He is the One who takes us there. It is He who is supported by all the prophets. He works out this for you – this great work of evolution.

So, one can understand very clearly that, if our Vishuddhi Chakra is put right, we develop exactly how to be discreet in Sahaja Yoga. We devise a method by which we talk so much that makes people feel priya that they appreciate, they like it – priya. It’s loving and also it does their hitha. Even sometimes you have to say something which is harsh or maybe your silence may make them feel a little harsh, doesn’t matter. It will give them ultimately their hitha. So the ultimate goal is hitha. That’s what Krishna had in His mind, to do the hitha. So, His Samhara Shakti also which He had – the killing – many people criticise Him for that. Like the Jains, you see.

At the time of Shri Krishna He had a cousin called Neminath; and Neminath was not Shri Krishna, he was just an ordinary human being who had achieved certain heights in evolution. He just got filled up with a kind of a feeling of a repulsion about killing animals. Of course, killing animals is not a very good thing, but he was not killing and it was to be done for his marriage. So he developed such a strong feeling about it that he started a different thing called Jainism. Some sort of another path, in which he said that there should be no killing of animals. It so became so ridiculously funny, that it reached a stage where bugs became more important than human beings, even mosquitoes were more important! You see those people walking with this thing covered on their faces and on the street. Everything taken to the last nonsense!

So Shri Krishna gives you discretion and this was very, very, very, very, very important because all our problems of disintegration disappear when we have discretion. But mostly people don’t have their Vishuddhi alright. On the one side there’s a Right Vishuddhi which gives us aggressiveness: With our talk we aggress others. Most of the politicians have that kind of a capacity. But if they get mediums into them like supra-conscious, like Hitler had...He learnt it from some Tibetan lamas who taught them these all dirty tricks of overpowering people. He managed to put such Spirits into them that they killed thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of human beings. The Left Vishuddhi is another problem. Such people also don’t have a collectivity sense because they are frightened of others. They are so negative they always see the negative side of another person. I have seen people who come and tell Me about every Sahaja Yogi, “That’s wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. This is wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. That’s wrong with...” No positive points at all! They only see the negative point. So they have no collectivity. They always have fear. All the time they are frightened of others because there’s something in them that frightens them. So they have their Left Vishuddhi very badly caught up because they are guilty – specially in the West, you will be surprised: who are supposed to be such aggressive people! They have terrible Left Vishuddhi, because they, by their doing, build up a very big guilt within themselves. They see how they have been behaving, their community has been behaving, their country has been behaving [so] they develop a big guilt in their mind.

Moreover, as Brian has told you, that it is cut – the roots are cut and you start behaving in an anti-God manner, even without realising that it’s absolutely wrong. It’s true. The Left Vishuddhi comes up because they feel guilty, despite their doing wrong things with the knowledge that they are doing the right thing. They feel guilty because in the sub-conscious the conscience of a person works it out and that guilt is accumulating howsoever you may deny it, but the left side goes on catching and they have a Left Vishuddhi [catch]. So, one has to say that, “Mother, I am not guilty.” It’s another side of ego where the ego’s reaction hides itself into Left Vishuddhi. And with that they start feeling guilty, “I should not have done that. I should not have done that.” Both attitudes are wrong. When you are on the left side you aggress yourself and torture yourself and when you are on the right side you torture others and aggress them.

So to be in the centre is only possible if your Vishuddhi Chakra is all right, otherwise you cannot. You have seen many people when they get Realisation they don’t feel vibrations on both the hands equally. The reason is they have no balance: it shows on the hands [that] they have no balance. Now hands are a very important part of human beings after Sahaja Yoga. If your hands do not have equal, equal vibrations, then something wrong with you. Whatever side you do not have vibrations, say, if you don’t have vibrations right side or you feel that right side is heavy, or is hot, then definitely you are right-sided person. In such cases maybe left side is absolutely numb. Those people [who] have numb left side, means also they are right sided. But in the left hand if you have more vibrations and on the right hand you don’t have any, then also it means that you are right sided, not that you are left sided. But on the other side if you have the other way round then you are a left sided person. That means the balance is not there. Your hand says that there should be balance.

So you must know that only by thinking, you are not going to get rid of your troubles in Sahaja Yoga – you have to work with your hands. As I told you that, just by thinking you can’t drive your car, you have to use your hands. You have to use your hands with full knowledge as to where you are, what you are and what would these vibrations mean. You have to use your hands. Now when you start using your hands for all practical purposes other people might start thinking, “These people have gone mad! They are using their hands.” But the same way they thought when Mohammed Sahib taught them to use their hands. They all laughed at Him! But now nobody is ashamed of it, nobody laughs at it, but they are doing all mechanically – not the way He has said.

So first of all, use these hands for your own purpose, for yourself. These same hands can help you. Now the Kundalini has awakened; so it is passing through all the centres in a very thin way maybe, but it is there. So first raise it more and more. You can do it with your hands. It’s a [virtuous] circle – when your hands raise it, it starts flowing more in your hands. Only your hands can raise it. It starts flowing in your hands. Giving yourself a bandhanor raise yourself – raise your Kundalini. Learn all these methods carefully. Your hands are very important. If your hands are not working you be careful on that. You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with. Some people who have had problems with their hands, because of previous life or some sort of a thing, they feel their chakras in the – their own places. Then after sometime, you’ll start feeling your chakras in your brain – doesn’t matter. You will never feel anything uncomfortable with it. You will be able to manage. After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You don’t feel anything. You just say, “This is it.” Finished! They just know. That also ‘knowing’ comes through your Vishuddhi and you just say it, again say it.

The most important function of the Vishuddhi Chakra is that it should be pure and clean because if you have to say mantras your Vishuddhi has to be clean. All the mantras have to have the help of Vishuddhi. When a guru gives a mantra, first thing you’ll find he will have a Left Vishuddhi catch and any other chakra whatever the chakra the guru has attacked. But first will be on the Left Vishuddhi, so for that we use the mantra of mantrasiddhi. The mantrasiddhi comes on a person when his Left Vishuddhi is alright, otherwise he cannot be mantrasiddhi. Whatever mantras they say is all mechanical. Your Left Vishuddhi should be alright if you have to say the mantras in a proper way to be effective to have enlightened mantras. Even “Allah ho Akbar” has no meaning if your Left Vishuddhi is not alright. So you will see how, in Sahaja Yoga, Left Vishuddhi is important and Right Vishuddhi is important for vibrations.

So Vishuddhi Chakra plays a tremendous part, role in, in Sahaja Yoga because it connects you to the Viraat, to the Whole. So you come to the point where you know that it is through Vishuddhi Chakra [that] you know the Whole, the Akbar; you get connected with Him. The rapport is established through Vishuddhi Chakra and you can feel it; it’s communicated. The rapport may be, supposing the hands are cut, still you might get your Realisation. Many get it. But if you do not have your hands intact, then the communication is poor. Then maybe on your chakras you will start developing the communication later on. But this is the easiest way to feel the communication in your hands, if your hands are sensitive. So what should we do to keep the Vishuddhi Chakra [clean] is the problem. I have been told that I should finish My lecture soon and go away soon! But I think I should finish this today about Vishuddhi Chakra.

What should we do to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra alright? Steal the butter and eat it. You must eat butter because it has vitamin A and D. Vitamin D especially, I am sorry, vitamin D. So that calcium grows in your body. So you’ll become a strong person. If you just take calcium without butter then there’s a problem. So try to take butter whenever you have Vishuddhi Chakra problem, for physical side; I’m just telling about this. You can take some butter in water, hot water; spread it on and take it. Vishuddhi Chakra looks after the cooling side – cooling side – because the liver, when it gives heat, the body becomes heated up. Then the one that really cools it down is the Vishuddhi Chakra and when you have a problem on the, on the drying of the epithelial cells inside, the lining, then best thing is to take some butter in the water, or eat some butter during summer time. But no carbohydrates with it, no carbohydrates. Then you won’t put on weight. You eat as much as you like – butter. You will not put on weight. If you can give up carbohydrates completely you will have satvikahara (balanced diet) absolutely. You should not touch carbohydrates and you will be amazed that you will have satvikahara. Take butter and proteins. Take all fats, cream, everything. Nothing will go wrong with you. You can take for proteins all dried fruits, everything and just take this honey for sweet. No carbohydrates. Or also these days honey is made out of sugar as you know. So if you can avoid carbohydrates and just take these things your health will be alright.

But we have [different] patients; we have all kinds of imbalances. That’s why I say, “Alright, if you have a liver, take sugar.” But if you just give up sugar it is not going to help. You have to first correct your liver and then you can give up sugar very easily. No problem. But not before that, like all the doctors in general say, “don’t take sugar.” The fat goes out of the body just giving the lining of the body, the softness, and goes out of the body. It doesn’t stay because, if there are no carbohydrates, it cannot be retained in the body. You can see at home. You put some butter on your hand. Alright? And wash it. It won’t wash. It will just stick there. It will have no effect – nothing, but it will be just sticking out there. It cannot be consumed. But if you put some carbohydrate say put some atta (flour) or something you can take it out; it dissolves. It cannot be dissolved if you do not take carbohydrates.

But this is for people who do not have any imbalances in the body, who are perfectly alright; they can do it. I can do it but nobody allows Me. Everybody uses Me for feeding as if I am a wastepaper basket. If I don’t eat... you see you are supposed to give Mother something like an ayurveda this much. But I have seen people when they want to give Me they’ll give Me so much and if I eat a little they’ll feel that, “oh what Mother is ....” I don’t need it actually! People should understand My nature. So when they serve Me, they’ll serve so much that I cannot eat. I just eat little. I can manage. There is no need for Me to eat carbohydrates at all – at all. I need not have carbohydrates. But, “Mother I have made this. Please have it. Mother I have made these ladoos (round sweets). Please have it. Mother I have...” So I say; “Alright Baba!” Now I have to suffer to please you people, for priya. This is what is very simple to understand that you should not force Me to eat, at all. There’s no need to force Me. Don’t force anyone to eat. Though I do force people to eat because I know they need it but you cannot do it; you have no discretion. When you have discretion, whom to force, whom not to force, then it’s alright. Also when you force you must know that the food has to be vibrated. If it is not vibrated food, if you force the person, he’ll have trouble.

Now for all of you to understand the importance of Vishuddhi Chakra is first and foremost thing is that when you speak you must speak about Sahaja Yoga and nothing else. If you have to give speech – I have known many Sahaja Yogis, you see, who are still member of this organisation, member of that organisation, member of this thing; of horrible organisations which are anti God. Say now, for example, we’ll see “Hare rama hare krishna” organisation is anti-Christ, anti. It is of course anti-Christ openly, and in the real sense is anti-Krishna – absolutely [anti] Krishna. Every person who goes there and begs in the name of God has a horrible Vishuddhi and they all suffer ultimately from Vishuddhi troubles – cancer, this, that and they die. And the face of a person who has a good Vishuddhi is blooming, is wide, is full of... full like a full moon. And if you have a face which is all shut down that means your Vishuddhi is not alright. If the Vishuddhi is functioning when there has to be glow on the face; the face should be full and nourished and sparkling and eyes should be sparkling because Vishuddhi Chakra also looks after the eyes. It looks after the neck. It looks after the ears. It looks after the nose.

If your Vishuddhi Chakras are spoiled you have problems with all E.N.T. (Ear Nose Throat) things. So the people who are like that; like this you see we can say the man who was the leader of that organisation. They think they are doing “Hare rama hare krishna”: actually they are doing absolutely anti-Krishna activities – absolutely! You have no business to call Krishna’s name like this, like mad! Standing before all the people, wearing these horrible dresses of these dhoti and kurtas; and which they are absolutely done in a very funny way. They don’t know how to wear it; the women wearing their saris and men buying those bhodis and putting them on their head and shaving their heads. Did Krishna shave His head? Did He ever shave His head? Head, the hair, are actually the part of Krishna’s gift. On the contrary He, His hair are always described, always described in the poetry.

There is a story about a great Urdu poet who was an Indian; who was a Hindu, but Urdu poet. And some fanatics, you see, challenged him. So they put one couplet and said, “You better complete this”.  ”Kaafir hai woh bandhe jo nahin Islam ke” (He is an infidel who does not believe in Islam”. So he completed it by saying ”Islam ke mafiq hai Yeshu mere Ghanshyam ke, Kaafir hai woh bandhe jo nahin Islam ke” (Just like Islam, is my Jesu like my Ghanshyam, He is an infidel who does not believe in Islam.” His hair are described in every poetry are used. Here they are shaving their heads, putting these bhodies on their heads and walking about. When did Krishna have [a] bald head? Did He have a bald head? He is Yogeshwara with sixteen thousand wives; means sixteen thousand powers. He didn’t have Sahaja Yogis to work out so He got them as wives. They were all Yoginis within. He created all this drama and He got them as wives because a man, if he has any women as disciples, then naturally he is blamed and as a man he has to have powers in the women.

Women are always the power, the shakti. So they came as His wives and He became the husband of sixteen thousand wives and the five ranis (queens) He had were the five elements within Him. He played all the tricks. He created.....you you how will you know about Him? How far can you go [in] understanding Him? So these people who are trying to call Shri Krishna every moment, every minute, standing on the streets and begging in His name. All over the places begging like beggars. Krishna couldn’t stand begging at all, never. He believed in having a right. He would [rather] steal than to beg. All these beggars being created in the name of God: I think it’s one of the greatest sins to beg in the name of God. I have seen this happening before the temples and all that and I used to think, “Before the temple in front of God to stand and beg. To be a fakir means to beg? What is this?” Is this the sign of a basha. Shri Krishna was a batshawa, Yogeshwara and these beggars, they are the followers of Shri Krishna? Horrible things. They look so miserable and they are absolutely like cabbages and many people believe that they are in peace.

Naturally if you are living in a smashana (cremation ground) you are in peace; in a dead condition. And our country, which is a poor country – supporting all these beggars here! All our rich people have given them money and lands. Is this the way we are going to support these lamas who come down from there and these horrible people coming down from the West? All the people who cannot work? Very nice! Come here, say, “hare rama hare krishna” and read Gita and say some few words by heart and then you earn your living here! Nicely living. Every village there is one or two sitting there and begging. Can you believe it? And our government is not bothered about it; to find out who are these people, why are they here, in the name of God why are they begging like this. And we have so many poor people who are begging in the name of God. Why not collect them and help them instead of helping these horrible people? Like this, you see, people have anti God activities and anti Krishna activities.

When you take the name of God in vain – Vishuddhi catches. I have known people sitting ‘warguru warguru warguru’ Is it so [that] Nanak Sahib is so cheap that we should go on taking His name, “warguru warguru warguru?” They’ll go on having the mala in the hand all the time. What is this going on? What do you think God to be? Is He in your pocket? Is He so cheaply available that you just go on doing all these things? Why? You spoil your Vishuddhi completely. One must understand. When... you see, you are surprised at... It is said that, “...” Still people start doing it. Karaka means what? Vishuddhi Chakra. That’s how you spoil your Vishuddhi Chakra. That’s how you spoil your main chakra of attaining Realisation.

So if you have to become one with the whole, please try to keep your Vishuddhi Chakra clear. Getting into colds because these days India especially...any, everywhere even in... women have a special tendency not to cover their body because they think they are not looking very fashionable or whatever it is. Is a very modern stuff has started that they want to wear scanty dresses. This is all anti God in both ways. Firstly it is nonsensical to show off your body. That’s why Mohammed Sahib said – you see He has worked so much on Vishuddhi Chakra – that women should cover their body. Is a very good thing I sometimes think. This nonsense of fashion has gone to such a limit that after some time you’ll find all these mosquitoes walking around without any clothes. That’s the ultimate. You see is a sign of people who are, who are neither ‘he’ nor ‘she’. The ‘it’ people do that way. Yes always. ‘It’ are the people who have qualities. That’s why Rajneesh, when people go to them, they become ‘it’. Because that is their capacity: no shame at all left in them. And that is what it is, one has to understand that you should be careful about your throats.

The fashions and all these things are not so important. What is important is your health. If you spoil your Vishuddhi it’s a very wrong thing and one should try to look after Vishuddhi all the time and all of you should try to look after each other’s Vishuddhi. Because I didn’t like the idea of having this pandal here and I told the organisers this was a wrong thing. So they said; “You said it should be in the open.” I said, “Now, I’m not saying you go to Himalayas.” You must use discretion, that’s the part missing. You must have discretion. To give people a thing in the mid-winter, such a place I mean – I must say you people are great seekers to be here – this is not proper thing to do. So the organisers, the people who are dealing with the collectivity must know that they should do something to protect the throat of people, to protect the Vishuddhi chakra. It’s very important, veryimportant. And you all know how I care for your Vishuddhi Chakras, everybody’s Vishuddhi Chakra, because I know how important it is. Because it will make you absolutely disintegrated and it will spoil all the work of Kundalini and poor Kundalini will suffer also. So we have to take it upon ourselves that we’ll keep our Vishuddhi Chakra clean, we’ll clean ourselves properly and we’ll clean our throats every morning and we’ll take gargling and everything and look after our Vishuddhi Chakra. It looks very mundane but for a Mother mundane things are as important as higher things are, because if there is no Vishuddhi Chakra what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga with a bad Vishuddhi Chakra?

So please try to look after your Vishuddhi Chakra. Try to put Yogeshwara there. Try to raise Shri Krishna there, try to be like Him. Keep your understanding that you are here to witness the drama of God and to be the murli(flute) of Shri Krishna to watch the beautiful melody flowing through you. May God bless you all.

Now today also they don’t want anyone to touch My feet. I hope today you will obey without any exception. Yesterday we tried but there were exceptions so today there should be no apowadas. Let us see. One day we should not touch Mother’s feet. Doesn’t matter. You all can touch from there, and there is a way of collectively touching Mother’s feet is the way we do always. You can all do it just now but we need not actually touch, but you are actually touching. Even touching the Mother Earth you are touching. Just touch the Mother Earth and you are there. Just touch the Mother Earth; you will find the Kundalini rising.

You haven’t given Me any questions whatsoever and those who have questions should write questions and give it to Me, because once I’ll go away then you will say, “Mother never allowed us to ask any questions.” I did say there are....

*******

[Explanation then follows in Hindi] After 1h17 questions and answers in Hindi, (for about 40 minutes)

Shri Mataji – What is it.  Read it aloud.

Shri Mataji, should we do the shraddha ceremony for the Pitras? (A ritual in honour, and for the benefit of deceased souls of the forefathers). And should we keep their photographs. I asked about this the other day.

Shri Mataji – They have asked the question, should we keep photos of the pitras (forefathers), and should we do the shraddha ceremony.  When thirteen days have passed we should do the Shraadh ceremony.  In shraddha also the question of discretion comes in.  In Sahaja Yoga if anyone finds the right heart is catching, it can mean that your father, who has died, his soul is not yet in peace. So in this case you should perform the shraddha.  But it should be done in Sahaja Yoga style.  Not in the way that people do ... by calling a brahmin and feeding him.

Once in Lucknow it happened that for one of the ancestors, shraddha had not been done, so we decided to do the shraddha.  They asked what is the vidhi (system of rite) that you follow.  So I said we cook food and serve it to everybody.  That is our way  of doing shraddha.  My sister-in-law who was very traditional in her beliefs, wanted to call five brahmins.  I said, ”Five! I cant even find one brahmin!”  She said ”No, we have five brahmins whom we can call”, so I said ”All right, call them”.

Five people came. They were neither realised, nor were they brahmin.  Five men came and sat and I thought lets see how they perform the shraddha.  When I asked them what we should do, they said, ”Nothing.  Just bring for each one of us, five kilos of Kalakand (a rich milk confection). I said, "All right, it sounds very easy".  In those days the cost of Kalakand was between Rs.10/- or Rs.5/- per kilo, and to spend Rs.25/- for each person was quite expensive, since we were government employees and not very rich.  But I thought, if this is going to please my sister-in-law let us get it.

We brought 25 kilos and gave 5 kilos to each brahmin.  I thought they would pack and take it home, but they opened the donas (leaf packing) and, without thinking of family or children, they sat and ate the whole thing – five kilos each, and I could only look on in amazement.  My sister-in-law was very happy and satisfied that the forefathers would be at peace seeing the brahmins being fed very well.

I said ”Jiji, would our forefathers have been able to eat five kilos of Kalakand at one sitting?”  The brahmins said, ”What is five kilos for us!” Now we will go to another house and eat; and tomorrow we will go again to other houses, and eat like this.  So I said, ”Really! I grant it to you that you are genuine brahmins.  Excuse Me, and let us know if there were any shortcomings in the shraddha!”  They said,”It is complete.  We never eat less than five kilos”.  And we let them go.

This kind of shraddha is not to be done.  There is a protocol even for shraddha.

There is another story of a Sahaja Yogi who was a so-called brahmin; but who became a real brahmin (realised soul) after coming to Sahaja Yoga.  He was from Maharashtra; and mostly when Maharashtrians get their realisation, they go all out to correct the misconception among the so called brahmin community.  Similarly, when a Christian comes into Sahaja Yoga and sees the reality of Christ’s teachings; he also gets after the Christian community.  When Sardarjis (Sikhs) come in, they feel that they have to correct the Sikh sardars.  And it is a right attitude. If you really care for your brothers then you will want to give them self realisation and correct them.  So this is what happens.

There was a brahmin with us, who after Realisation became a real brahmin; and now he is after all the brahmins.  His mother told him one day that it was his father’s death anniversary, and we have to do a Shraadh.  So go and get a brahmin.  He said, ”I will not go and get any brahmin.  There are no brahmins”.  So she said, ”No, no.  This is a family brahmin”.  In those days there were family barbers, family bangle sellers, who served families on a regular basis.  So she asked him to go and get him.

So he went, and told the brahmin, ”I do not believe in this shraddha ritual, but my mother has sent me so I have come to call you”.  The brahmin said, ”Alright. You fix Thursday (Guruvaar) for the shraddha”.  The Sahaja Yogi asked him whether Tuesday would be a better day, but the brahmin insisted that Thursday is a very auspicious day, and he had consulted the Panchang [calendar of auspicious days and times], and it should be fixed for Thursday.

The Sahaja Yogi came home and consulted the Panchang. (In Maharashtra every home has a panchang because they know how to interpret the Sanskrit language).  In that it was written that on Thursdays, (Guruvar) , shraddha is ”nishidh” (prohibited), and never to be done on Thursday.  So he did the Shraadh on Tuesday according to the Sahaja way.  The Brahmin, (who must have had another appointment on Tuesday), arrived on Thursday and started giving the list of things to be bought.  But the Sahaja Yogi told him he would get nothing, not even a cup of tea; and he should leave.  When he asked the reason, the Sahaja Yogi showed him the panchang which said that, 'Thursday was most inauspicious for a shradha'.  He told him to see for himself, and that in fact he had performed the shraddhaceremony on Tuesday.  So he was asked to leave.  The mother felt sorry, and asked her son to at least give him a glass of milk.  The son said, ”No! And this brahmin should never come here again for any ceremonies in future”.

So this is not the kind of shradha to be done for the benevolence of the forefathers.  It has no meaning.

Shri Mataji - Second question was whether we should keep photographs of dead relatives.  There is no harm in keeping photographs if you are not involved with it.  We must understand that they have left this world, and they have to take a rebirth.  So if a photo is kept, and we start doing aartis and pujas to it; or we keep crying and weeping in front of it; then better to put it away.  If the attitude towards the photo is that this was my father, or mother, and now he or she is no more; and no attachment is there, then it is OK. There is no problem.  But mostly I have seen, that every time one looks at the photo, the whole attention and conversation is on that departed person.  If this is happening, then dont keep the photograph outside.  Because it is disturbing the attention.  Again the question of discretion is to be used.

Question: Should women do the fasting [vrat] of Karvachauth?
Shri Mataji: Do not do any kind of fasting (vrat). The question is: Should women do fasting of karvachauth ? I have seen women doing this kind of fasting. They get too distressed. Do not do it. If you can do it without any problem, then it is ok. In Sahaja Yoga, there is no need to put God in trouble by torturing yourself. No need to do it after Realisation. All their husbands will remain healthy. And if the husband is a Sahaja Yogi, then there is no problem at all. No need to do that.
Everyone says Parvatiji did this severe fast of karvachauth. But She did it before marriage. Not after marriage. What is the need to do it after you get married?
The most important protocol of karvachauth is to understand and recognise your husband, and respect him as your husband. Understand him and take good care of him. Try to understand them, what are they. They are like children. Many a times their behaviour is like a child. For small, small things they will get disturbed and upset. And also their ego cools down very fast. You should see it and learn all these things about them. Be loving towards them; talk sweetly with them. Give them happiness. This is the real karvachauth. Not that during the karvachauth fast, you have angry thoughts about him and call him names. So once again the matter of discretion comes up.
Actually, I have not seen karvachauth being observed properly by most women. If they do the fast, their attention is all the time on when they will see the moon, and when can they break their fast. They are so overcome with hunger, that they start troubling every one with their impatience. What is the need for such a kind of fast?

This fast should be done by unmarried girls, praying to get a husband like Shri Shiva. But first of all, are you like Shri Parvati? First make yourself like Shri Parvatiji, and then desire for a husband like Shri Shiva. It is not an easy task to handle a husband like Shri Shiva, Who sits on bull. Shri Shiva cannot be the husband of anyone, except Shri Parvati. Only She can manage Him. He is fierce and difficult, and to desire for such person is a mistake. When you cannot handle such an exacting and strict person, then why do you desire for someone like him?

The last question is: during the menstrual period can women perform pujas, and can they give Realisation and vibrations.

Shri Mataji: In Sahaja Yoga, the natural process of menstruation is not considered ”Nishidh” (prohibited).  In Sahaja Yoga nothing is considered ”Nishidh”. Only, during those days ladies should rest. And regarding pujas, you know what are my thoughts in that matter. First of all, Whom are you worshipping in the Puja.There also there is a lot of tamasha (ignorance). For this also you will have to go very deep to get the right knowledge.

I feel that for the time being dont worry about pujas. Do more of Dhyan (meditation). For whatever fruits you did puja all this time, you have received the fruits and got your realisation. So now no need for pujas. Do meditation. You do not seem to know that you are realised, and there is no more need for pujas.  Do more meditation. It is like sitting in a car, going for a program. And even after reaching the program you still want the car to keep moving instead of getting down and doing the program.

So till you settled down in your Realisation, there was need for pujas. We should try to understand how we made this journey and how we reached. The whole situation changes. Like, you had to get down from your car and walk to get to this program place. The whole scene changed. To get down you had to stop your car from moving.  The situation changed. Now, in the same way, in Sahaja Yoga, we have to chane our style and situation.

Question from a young girl:  Shri Mataji, I am having white patches on my body, and no treatment is helping to cure me.

Shri Mataji:  Leucoderma comes from bad liver.  If it is triggered by some negativity or possession, the disease spreads very fast.  That is why such a person should first get rid of the bhoot and badha (possession and negativity).  And should never use groundnut (peanut) oil.  This Postman brand of peanut oil is very, very bad  Hope the makers of this oil dont get after My life.  But all kinds of peanut oil is harmful, like Dalda, etc..  And those who eat too much of peanuts also get this disease.  For this reason you must completely give up eating peanuts.  In My whole life I must have only eaten three or four peanuts.  Dont eat too much of peanuts.  Those who have this problem, after you get your realisation bring some oil and I will vibrate it.  You can rub it on the areas in a circular motion.  And also cure your liver.  At least it will not spread further.  It might even reduce.

[In English]
The lastest: Gracious Mataji, what is the cause of insomnia, and how can it be eradicated? ‘Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu, Nidra Rupen Samstitha’. Nidra is the deity, how she is to be appeased?

Shri Mataji: The question is about insomnia, and what are the deities involved as far as the Nidra is concerned. ‘Ya devi sarva bhuteshu, Nidra rupen samstitha’. She is the one who gives you sleep, is the left side, is the Mahakali. That one gives you sleep. And to get to her, you must raise your Mahakali tattva.
So, all those who have this insomnia business, should raise the left side and put it to the right. Try about 108 times first of all. Then you have to do some deep breathing. In deep breathing, you go to the left side more. And with deep breathing you relax and then you put your attention to Sahasrara, and sleep off. But insomnia is absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga, if you know how to put left to the right.

After that, you should also clear out your Agnya Chakra. Like this, if you turn your Agnya Chakra, you can do it or ask some Sahaja Yogi to turn your Agnya Chakra or put your hand on the Agnya Chakra. But the problem is, if you ask any other Sahaja Yogi, he might get insomnia. [Laughter]
So best thing is you use my photograph and try to turn your Agnya Chakra like this. Also you can use the Kumkum to put there, which will make you sleepy. And if you try to sleep in complete darkness, never try to sleep if there is any streak of light coming in the room. Because as long as Surya is there, your Agnya Chakra takes over. And when the Surya is there, the light makes you feel very active, over active sometimes, and you cannot sleep. And this insomnia is absolutely curable. You dont take any medicines or anything for that.

Another thing, taking tea like this in the night, you might get insomnia. Not me, but you might get. But normally, never take any tea or coffee after 6 o’clock. Never! And make it a point. I also try to do that because, just to give you a lesson, but I have no problem of sleeping. But you should not take any tea or coffee after 6 o’clock. Say about 5 o’clock, afterwards you should not take. You will see that you will sleep very well.

On the contrary, in the West, people always take coffee after dinner. And then they take a pill to sleep. [Laughter]
You must take milk. And milk covered with a little butter and sleep with that hot milk. It’s a very good way of sleeping. If you do not get sleep, it’s very good, milk is better. But instead of that, you take coffee, means you cannot sleep. When you have to study, you take coffe that you can keep awake. But to take coffee and then take a pill. What is the discretion in this?

Is there any other Question please.

[In Hindi] Is there anything else to ask.  What are they saying?

About Asthma

Shri Mataji: Asthma comes from the Right Heart problem, and is curable.  Absolutely curable.  For Asthma you have to do the mantra of Shri Rama and Sita. It comes from the father’s thing, like maybe your father is dead, you are attached to father, he died suddenly; or you had no father in childhood.  Maybe your relationship with father is strained; maybe that you cant see your father.  Anything like that can be there.  And also it can come from bad relationship with husband also.  Asthma can come, or the husband, if he is not a good husband to his wife, he can get asthma very much.  If he lost his father early, and he doesnt keep good relationship with the wife, he’ll get always asthma.  So that can also happen.

You can tell him, that Sardarji.  You can sit there.  You can tell all your problems to him.  You can tell him if there is a problem.

Question:  What is Sachh Khand, or Dassam Dwar.  What is this.

Shri Mataji – Sachh Khand is the Limbic Area in the brain.  Where the Satya (truth) is established. Where Sathya Prakash (Light of truth) manifests, prakatit means happens.  Prakatit Hona – this word means where it manifests in your awareness.  Not that someone lets off a lecture and says this is the truth, that is the truth. But within the brain, the inside area which is called Sahasrara, that is Sachh Khand.  It is fully open, and all around it there are 1000 Nadis.  And at the time when Kundalini awakens and reaches that khand (limbic area) then you begin to know the truth.  Sat-Ya, the truth is always felt on your awareness.  Chetana is the light of your brain, and when chetana is enlightened then only you come to know the Satya, the truth.  This Viraat that is here, this Viraat is spread all around, is the Paramatma.  When that Paramatma is awakened you get the knowledge of Satya inside yourself.  For example, when your Kundalini is awakened and comes out of the fontanelle bone area, and you become a Sahaja Yogi, it is not due to the accumulated knowledge that you have, but the truth starts manifesting itself.  Then what happens – supposing you want to know the truth about something.

For example, if someone says that whatever Nanak Sahib says is not the truth; someone said such a horrible thing; then you can say – ”Ask the vibrations. You ask – Was Nanak Sahib the truth itself?”  As soon as you put out your hands and ask, Was Nanak Sahib an incarnation, the vibrations will be felt pulsating intensely. ”Was Nanak Sahib Paramatma”, again strong flow of vibrations.  Then you will believe that he was God.  Then it is not just a collection of knowledge.  When the Sahasrara opens, then it is not an accumulation of verbal or mental knowledge; but the reaction of your Spirit to the truth; in the form of vibrations.  You will start seeing that the truth manifests in your hands as vibrations.  You can know whether this or that is right.

Like as if your brain is a computer, and when it is connected to the mains, then we start realising the Self.  The Self within you, connects to the all pervading Divine Power, and you get your knowledge from there.  Then you know what is the truth, and what is wrong.  So the Sachh Khand is the Shakti of Mahalakshmi, by which a human being becomes the Truth.

In addition there are two more Shaktis of our Spirit, which manifests within us, which is called Chitth Shakti.  By this the entire area of our awareness gets enlightened, the awareness.  With that attention, if we just sit in meditation, without doing anything, not asking any questions (if you ask with your Vishuddhi you will get to know the truth); but you just sit with your hands like this and just put your attention on anyone, immediately you will know on your hands what is his condition.  This is getting the knowledge of the truth.

Secondly, if someone is sitting next to you, and suddenly you feel that a lot of heat is coming out of this person, a lot of heat; so you even start feeling the Collective situation around you.  Your whole attention has spread into Collective Consciousness, and become enlightened; and the effect on your heart is a feeling of joy.

These three experiences come into your awareness, and this happens when the Kundalini comes into the Sachh Khand, and this is called Dasham Dwar, Brahmand.  As soon as your Kundalini breaks through this Sahasrara, this subtle energy, the Ruh, which is the Primordial Spirit of God Almighty, starts being felt on your hands.  Then you know this is the vibration of the Holy Spirit.  Is that alright?  But this is not the knowledge from books or mental knowledge.  It is the actualisation of the Kundalini rising.  It is a spiritual happening.

Kahey Nanak Bin Aapa Chinhey, Mitey Na Bhram ki Kayi –  Nanak says - Without first knowing your Self, you cannot get rid of the scum of confusion which covers your awareness and prevents you from knowing your spirit.

Just by singing bhajans, just by talking about it, by giving lectures, nothing is going to happen.  The kundalini has to be awakened.  Isn’t it so?  The reality, is what you have to achieve.

”Yes My child”.  Schizophrenic?  Schizophrenia comes from the attack by negative forces.  Like if someone has done black magic on you; or you have bowed your head before a false guru; in front of wrong things.  This Mattha (forehead) is a very important area.  It is the place of Ekadesha Rudra.  Here there are the energy of eleven Rudras, here on the forehead.  This should not be bowed in front of anyone.  Forehead should only be lowered in front of such a person who is authorised to receive such bowing and obeisance.  Should not bow before any useless person.  There is no need to even bow before Me, until such time that you have become realised.  Why do you want to bow at My Feet.  What have I given you.  I tell you hundred times do not touch My Feet.  Instead I get troubled and physical discomfort, if wrong people come and touch My Feet.

So you must only bow your heads before an authorised guru.  But now there are so many false gurus. It is alright if you go to the Gurudwara and bow before the Granth Sahib (Holy Book). Because Granth Sahib is the truth.  Otherwise if we keep touching the feet of this one and that one, it is not right or good.  For this you can even get a catch when you go to the Gurudwara, because you did a wrong thing.  When there is already the Granth Sahib, there is no other guru worthy of bowing to.  Accepting any and every person as a guru is wrong.  So only bow to the Granth Sahib.  There is no other guru beside that.

What is Mattha?  Bowing your head before anyone means surrendering.  There is no meaning in continuously doing akhanda paath, (continuous, unbroken singing of the Book).  He has said Ida, Pingala, Sushumna Nadi.  From within that Nadi the Kundalini awakens and comes out of the Fontanelle (Shoonya Shikhar).  Until and unless it breaks through this fontanelle bone area, nothing happens, nothing is achieved.  So till then, one has to be in a surrendered state.  This is what bowing the head means.

People do other unclean practises which can cause this disease.  Or due to extreme weakness.  During childhood a sudden shock might create a situation where bhoots and other negative forces gain entry.  It can happen from that also.  But for this there is no need to go to any negative people like tantriks and mantriks, who are all dirty people.  And if anyone has taken money to get rid of possessions, you must never go near them; because theyu take out one spirit and put another into your being.  Any man who is interested in your money, you should never go near such a person.

Question:  Which Prabhu (God) should we worship?

Shri Mataji: Once you come into Sahaja Yoga you will discover that you are your own guru.  And when you say ”Prabhu” all the deities come within that.  Call it by any name, it is the same thing.  You may call it Sasarir Kaal, that also is the same thing. You can call it by any name.  But first of all, understand the magnitude, the greatness.  Understand fully, what is the meaning of ”Prabhu” and then you can call it by name.  But first of all make the preparations to receive it.  Get the knowledge of this great being; then you will know the aspect of this God Almighty you have to recognise and worship.

Supposing your chakra of Shri Rama is catching and is disturbed; and you are calling the name of Nanaka.  You are unnecessarily troubling Nanaka when the chakra of Shri Rama is in trouble.  And if your chakra of Nanaka is catching, why are you troubling Shri Rama.  This is what you have to understand first.  Without the rising of Kundalini, you cannot know at which point a chakra is catching.

Until you start your vehicle, you cannot know where the turn is, where you must steer your car.  If you turn your car to the left or right, before it even starts, how will you know where the problem is.  As and when you reach the turns or the obstacles, then only you can steer your car accordingly.  First of all understand what is the movement of your kundalini, and where it has been obstructed.  Everything depends on you.  You have to understand your instrument.  Then only you will know at what chakra your kundalini has stopped, and what mantra has to be said to remove the problem.  You say the mantra and the correct deity awakens and cures; and your kundalini continues on Her journey.  Then the next deity awakens, and you go further.  In this journey you have to keep your attention alert, so that you know where your Kundalini is at any given point.

In Sahaja Yoga the complete knowledge of this Mantra Vidya is explained, and you become fully capable.  You can experiment and have person experiences.  There is no blind faith involved.  You can know yourself where your Kundalini is at any time.  When these western Sahaja Yogis have the knowledge of Who Nanaka Sahib is, and Who is Shri Ganesha, then why cant you master this knowledge.  You already know these things.  You should not have a closed mind.  Only then will you know all about your Kundalini.  And it should not worry you that this prophet did not mention this, or that saint did not talk about it.  No problem.  Because they did not have sufficient time.  They were being tortured by human beings, and they would not let them speak openly.  Whatever time they had, they tried to give the maximum knowledge that they could manage.  Whatever Shri Rama had come to do, He did.Now My job is to raise the Kundalini, and that is what I am doing.  Whatever job each one came for, he did that only.  Whatever he had to do is done, so now dont hold on to him and ask why he did not mention these things, and therefore I am not going to believe it.

Every one spoke about the future.  Just understand this.  They all talked about what was going to come in the future.  No one claimed that that was the time.  They all said that the right time would come in the future.  Even Mohammed Sahib said that Resurrection Time will come in the future.  They said it many times.

And Now the time has really come, and you are hesitating, because in the past no one talked about Kundalini awakening.  But didn’t they all promise that the time for resurrection is going to come when you will get all the knowledge.  Everyone said.  And yet when that time has come, you are not ready to believe it. Because Nanak Sahib did not say.  But then they had to leave something for Me to say also!  Isn’t it?  Or did they finish saying everything.  Did you even let them say all that they wanted.  You are not allowing Me to say anything; what would you have allowed them to say.  Instead you all took their lives.  You got after their lives.  As long as they were alive, how many followed their teachings.  Even their wives got after their life.  And now, when they are not there, you say what you like about them.  Is that going to help in any way.

We must see what is for our good, for Swaarth, means knowledge of the Self.  Very nice word, this ”Swaarth ”!  Swa means Self; and Arth means Knowledge.  Even Shivaji Maharaj said a time will come when we will seek the meaning of Swaarth.  Gyaneshwarji has mentioned in his Pasayadan that a day will come like this, when you will get the knowledge of your Tantra (instrument).  You will know the knowledge of Swa, and you will know what is the union with Brahma.  You will know the meaning of the union of Nirakar with Aakar (form merging into formless).

They have all said this and gone.  But we are not doing anything to prepare for that happening.  We have just caught hold of what one person said; or the other person said; and are sitting, still holding on.  Did this do any good for our forefathers, or for you.  Alright!  If something is still incomplete, it is going to be completed now.

They didn’t do anything less.  They did a lot.  But there was a limit to what they had come to do.  Then there comes the final stage, when everything is assembled together.  Like when you make puris in your house.  First of all you knead the flour, then you roll it into roundels, then you deep fry it, and then you eat it.  When you eat and enjoy it, that is the completion of the project.  Before that the preparations were being made.  Now you might say puri-making is only kneading of the flour; or puri making means the frying of it; but you are never ready to eat it.  You are still stuck with kneading of the flour.  You must now get ready to taste it and eat it.  The puris are ready, so why not eat and enjoy.  When it is placed before you, why dont you eat it.  Do you understand.  This is the mistake human beings make, and because of this you will be left behind.  Left very far behind.  We must understand that the time for enjoying the puris has come.  The Mother has made the puris, so come and eat it.  Straightforward!

Yes, My child.

Question:  How can one experience Chinmay Roop?

Shri Mataji: Put these ideas aside.  First of all you must know the all pervading Brahma Shakti.  Receive that Shakti into yourself.  Now what idea you have of Chinmay Roop, and what you understand it to be, this is all accumulated knowledge from books or hearsay.  Whatever you have read, or whatever anyone has said, should not have any connection with you.  You have not seen it, right?  First you must get to know the all pervading Divine Energy which is spread all over.  Once you get into contact with it, you will start understanding everything.  First get it.  Allow that subtle experience to happen to you.  Allow it to happen inside you.  And this cannot happen without Kundalini awakening.  Everyone has said this before they went.  First let this all pervading energy awaken within you, and then slowly, very slowly, you will get to know everything.

It is like when you enter a room, and a light is put on, slowly slowly you start seeing all the objects inside.  But first you have to enter the room.  Why do you want to know what happens later.  Why should I tell you that just now.  Alright?

First you have to enter the door.  The best thing is to first come inside and take your realisation.  You dont become an Avadhut (divine body) immediately.  Because even to transform into an Avadhut you need to have the Divine Energy, the Shakti, awakened in you.  Slowly and gradually  you have to transform into a divine personality who can bear the Divine Energy within himself.  Then you will be able to support the energy of God inside you.  Then you will gradually know the truth.

I have not told you the whole truth for fear of your reaction.  If I tell you, you will start jumping.  That is why you must advance slowly.

English:

Question:  Is there any cure in Sahaja Yoga for Aortic Stenosis? Incompetence of the wall of the heart

Shri Mataji: Who is the person who has incompetence of the wall of the heart.  Are you vegetarian.  Are you a vegetarian.

Yes, Mother

Shri Mataji:  Automatically it will come with vegetarianism.  Absolutely.  It is lethargic heart.  So we will tell you what is to be done.  How to cure it.  It is absolutely curable.  But you will have to eat proteins.  If you do not want to take non-vegetarian, you will have to eat proteins and give up carbohydrates.  Then only it will work out.  But you will have to be careful to eat more proteins.  The rest of it we will see.

The following part is not on the video and the video looks to be incomplete:

Back to English at the end at 1 :52
“Question : ...and here is the daughter, who’s having hearing problem.
Shri Mataji: Hearing problem can be cured, very easy it is, and we’ll tell them how to do it, but they have to go to the centre. All these people have to go to the centre, settle down in Sahaja Yoga, become Sahaja Yogis, and every problem can be solved. I can tell you, you need a good health, now the Bran who was speaking here, he used to have crashes [?]. He could not walk one step. Can you believe he’s climbing and talking. So all the problems are cured, all the emotional problems are settled, everything just promised, but first you get your Yoga, you must get your Yoga, then every thing can be done.
This is the first condition of Sahaja Yoga, for which you don’t have to pay, for which you don’t have to do anything, stand on your head or anything – nothing of the kind- but give some time to yourself, take to Yoga, go to your centres every week, which we have in every house...Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi”
