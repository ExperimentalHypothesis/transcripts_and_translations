b"Vishuddhi Chakra, Delhi (India), Public Programme, 2 February 1983.\n\nThe prophets are born and create a ripple in our consciousness, a new dimension to our understanding to religion, dharma; which has to be assimilated and has to be understood that, whatever the previous prophets have said, has to be culminated into something else.\n\nSo as we can say Mohammed Sahib has said that all these prophets who have come on this earth have created a new ripple and also has sustained human beings with a newer evolution, a newer foliage opening into them. The idea of human beings of newness is that we have to give up all that is old and we have to become new. Or [perhaps] they think that newness means absolutely a juxtaposition condition in which one has to rise: and this is the cause of the folly of many people in the West as well as in the East. Whenever a new theme started\xe2\x80\xa6 like, we can say that, first of all a great saint came on this earth and he found that the people are following the idol worship in a very wrong way. Because it is said in The Bible that: whatever is created by Mother Earth should not be reproduced and worshipped. So they created another extreme religion out of it saying that\xc2\xa0nothing\xc2\xa0should be worshipped!! But it is said, \xe2\x80\x98Whatever is reproduced by the Mother Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So there are so many such things all over the world which are created by the Mother Earth. So they should not be worshipped by\xc2\xa0reproducing\xc2\xa0them and making images out of them. When such a prophet died saying that, \xe2\x80\x9cThis should not be done, one should not worship images,\xe2\x80\x9d the other side of it started \xe2\x80\x93 the extreme! Going to the extreme that there should be\xc2\xa0no worship\xc2\xa0even if the Mother Earth has created. So, all the human beings were divided into [different] extreme conditions. One situation comes in where one has to say that, \xe2\x80\x9cThis should not be done,\xe2\x80\x9d so people take up that theme and just start building up onto that and saying that,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis should not be done as told by the prophet.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Of course, [only] after the\xc2\xa0death\xc2\xa0of the prophet! When the prophet is living\xc2\xa0nobody\xc2\xa0listens to him! They all torture him, bother him, do all kinds of things and ultimately they may even\xc2\xa0kill\xc2\xa0him.\n\nThen another point is: every prophet is born at a different period of time. So, depending on the time when he is born, he talks of a particular problem. Say, when Mohammed was born. Mohammed Sahib said very clearly that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not drink.\xe2\x80\x9d So people said that,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlright, we will not drink, but we can smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So he had to rectify himself. He\xe2\x80\x99d said,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI am the last who has come,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0but He found that it is not so. So He came back again as Nanaka to tell people that \xe2\x80\x93 do not smoke also!\n\nLike that, the persons, or the group of persons, who follow\xc2\xa0one\xc2\xa0incarnation, go to\xc2\xa0another\xc2\xa0extreme, and try to push down all the traditions [of] all that has come so far, built up. Like cutting the whole tree and [then to] start their own tree, which is artificial. Then the quarrel started when Mohammed Sahib was driven to another level and then Nanaka\xe2\x80\x99s disciples were driven to another level where they just thought they have no relationship with each other, which is not Truth.\n\nAfterwards also, you know, so many such things have happened in this world. We can see that [when] any revival starts, people go to the extreme of it and get\xc2\xa0completely\xc2\xa0ruined. In Christianity you will find the same thing happened. When Christ came in, whatever problems He faced He talked about them. But the main thing He had to talk about [was] the resurrection, about the ascent. And He\xc2\xa0talked\xc2\xa0about the ascent. He talked about the Spirit and in His resurrection He showed that He ascended. But people did not stick to that point. They never thought that you have to ascend in Christianity. Nobody bothered that you have to ascend. They took small little things from somewhere. Also a person came later on called \xe2\x80\x98Saint\xe2\x80\x99 Paul who was not at all with Christ or anything. He started a religion of Christianity which was all absurd, against Christ, anti-Christ.\n\nNone of these prophets have discarded any prophet who came before them. Now the problem came in that one has to integrate and Mohammed Sahib knew that a day will come when this integration problem will start and he talked a lot about Sahaja Yoga in the sense he said when the resurrection time will come. He talked more about resurrection than about doom time, most surprising thing is. About\xc2\xa0Qiyamah\xc2\xa0He spoke very little. He spoke really about the resurrection time, because that was the problem. The problem that they face they talk about. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you how Buddha talked only about Atma Sakshatkar (Self-realisation) and not about God. Because those people who went to God, or thought of God, or just studied God thought they will be gods themselves! So he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must get your Self-realisation.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Mahavira who talked about the hell where people can go, because that was his job, the part of it and the part of it and the part of it and the part of it. These are the different aspects of human beings which they had to awaken; different aspects.\n\nWhen Mohammed Sahib started teaching people to do\xc2\xa0namaz\xc2\xa0people used to\xc2\xa0laugh\xc2\xa0at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing? Why does he want us to put hands like this? Why does he want us to sit down or put our hands on the knees?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Now you understand as Sahaja Yogis what it means: that he wanted us to improve our\xc2\xa0Nabhis\xc2\xa0first, our dharma first. All this movement was to jerk out the Kundalini. But without Realisation being there\xc2\xa0namaz\xc2\xa0would not work out, you may break your knees you may do what you like! But the extremes people catch hold of it and not the reality. And they make a fuss out of it and they make create a big organisations and things and that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is spoiled. So when he said that\xc2\xa0Allah ho Akbar\xc2\xa0is to be said with your fingers in your ears, you all say that isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? All the Sahaja Yogis say with this finger in their ears, \xe2\x80\x9cAllah ho Akbar!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Because you know\xc2\xa0this\xc2\xa0is the finger that represents the Vishuddhi and the Vishuddhi Chakra\xe2\x80\x99s deity, Shri Krishna, becomes the Viraata with Akbar. So, when you say about Akbar, you have to put your fingers into your ears and you have to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAllah ho Akbar!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n[The] whole relationship and everything was never understood. For Indians Shri Krishna was\xc2\xa0their\xc2\xa0Omkara, for Western people Christ was\xc2\xa0theirOmkara, for other people of Arabistan,\xc2\xa0Mohammed was their Omkara. How can that be? They are all\xc2\xa0related\xc2\xa0to each other. So, how to relate to each other is a problem of Sahaja Yoga. When they come from different communities and different\xc2\xa0fixed\xc2\xa0ideas it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to stir them and tell them that: you are all one! We talk of Hindu Muslim unity for example. Mohammed Sahib didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there were problems like that, but [Guru] Nanaka did say we have come to do Hindu Muslim unity. But in the outside if you do the Hindu Muslim unity or any unity, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out in the outside relationship. Even your brother may not be your own brother, if it is working outside. But if the Spirit is awakened within you, then Spirit is the one which is the connection with the Whole, with the Viraata, with the Akbar. When Akbar is to be felt you have to have your Realisation, otherwise you are just talking in the air; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know Who is this Akbar. You have to get connected to that Viraata and that Viraata is the Primordial Being.\n\nWe are actually not integrated at all because we have different incarnations. Even if you are not absolutely atheist, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t say that you do not believe in God, or believe in something else which is anti-God, even if you believe in God, you believe in God in fragmentations, in His different aspects, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t see Him in collectivity. You have to see that He is one God. Everybody says He is one God. Of course He is one God. I am one person but I am also a housewife, I have to do some work for My household, I am also a sister of somebody, I am also your Mother and mother of My own children and also a grandmother. So I have so many various aspects of My work which I do. One person has to do it. When we talk of God as One, we think He is [like the] Rock of Gibraltar \xe2\x80\x93 just one piece. Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you go and see it, is not one piece. Anything in this world you cannot say is one piece. It has to be a compound or a mixture of something. Then how can God be just one piece hanging in the air like one?\xe2\x80\x9cGod is One, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll not have any other aspect of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0God has many aspects, which one has to understand.\n\nSo there are two concepts which work out in this world I feel: one is that they believe that there is only one God and there cannot be many aspects of God , which is wrong. Christ has said,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThose who are not against Me are with Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So this kind of a mental conception about God, that He is just like Rock of Gibraltar. See now this pandal (meaning: an Indian marquee with open sides to shade from the sun) you have done it: There are so many lights. They are all giving one light to all of us. They are not giving separate lights are they? How are they fighting with each other? What is the fight going on? They are adding to the same light. This is one pandal but we have so many lights. We cannot do with one light.\n\nAt different periods a person has to be born. Every period a person had to be born to enlighten one aspect of human awareness and consciousness. Variety has to be there because human beings are varied. And the variety is that, supposing you are supporting somebody\xe2\x80\x99s right-sidedness, then there should be somebody who will come and support the left-sidedness. And it is all done so well within us. But it is\xc2\xa0only\xc2\xa0human beings in their obstinacy and in their ignorance cannot see it. We all are made the same way if you see in the whole world. Of course there is variety in appearances. Maybe an Indian looks like an Indian and\xe2\x80\xa6but in India only you can see Indians have so many different faces. You can find all colours and all kinds of things on their faces. In India is the only place where you find all kinds of people. You can have people like Russians, you can have people like Japanese, Chinese. You can have people like Africans. All kinds of people are in this country to show that all people can be called as one race, as Indians.\n\nNow it is not always ignorance that makes people forget that we are all one. Every human being laughs the same way. Does he laugh in a different way? If he has to eat the food he masticates the same way. He cries the same way. When he cries his crying is the same. His actions are the same way. If a woman is angry with her husband\xe2\x80\xa6yesterday I saw ?? program with My brother and I was amazed how universal we are in our expressions. He was showing how a woman gets angry with the husband and how she behaves. If you see those actions which are depicted you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed that they are done by all the women all over the world. And the reaction of man if you want to see \xe2\x80\x93 all the men act in the same way. My husband was secretary to Shastriji\xc2\xa0(Prime Minister of India 1964-66). You know that and he went with Lal Bahadur Shastri to Tashkent at his last time. But also he went once to Yugoslavia and there\xe2\x80\xa6(aside: who was General Tito was where? Yugoslav)\xe2\x80\xa6and General Tito\xe2\x80\x99s wife, you see, got very friendly with Mrs. Shastri. Both were very friendly. So Shastriji warned his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cSee now! You are great friends and now don\xe2\x80\x99t start crying like an Indian woman when you leave.\xe2\x80\x9d So, poor thing was controlling her tears all the time. But she told Me, \xe2\x80\x9cI was controlling but it is\xc2\xa0she\xc2\xa0who started crying and such a lot! And then she started crying loudly, hugging me. So I just could not control myself. I also gave in. I also started crying.\xe2\x80\x9d And both the husbands started looking at the ground! So basically all the women, all the men, in the whole world, react the same way to a situation. And you can see their reactions very clearly when it comes to children. They all act in the same way, act in the same manner. Supposing they hear that two children are caught up in the air somewhere, or something is happening to them \xe2\x80\x93 the whole world will be worried about how they are going to be saved.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSomething must be done to save them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The whole world will be praying to God,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOh God please save these two children are caught up there somehow or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Everybody will be worried as if their own child is there. Even when it comes to death I have seen that. When there was a air space, the space craft (Apollo 13) was going to land and people were worried that they may be lost. I know in every masjid (mosque), in every temple, in every church and everywhere\xe2\x80\xa6they were Americans [but] nobody thought of Americans, what religion, anything. To them it was a part of human beings, you see. The human bondage started acting. That time they never thought what country they were, what Americans have done to Indians, nothing of the kind! They just thought,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOh God! These people are\xe2\x80\xa6oh God please save them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Everybody prayed to God and prayed for them that they should be saved. [At] that time, what had happened to us? How did we forget? We touched to the Reality at that time and that is what it is. Anybody who tries\xe2\x80\xa6these Jews when they were troubled by Hitler \xe2\x80\x93 everybody\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies were with them. But when these Jews started troubling the Muslims there everybody\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies were with Muslims. Then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you think all religions? Even the Jews had sympathies with Muslims. Then we don\xe2\x80\x99t think what differences we have with them. None of them, none of the people I heard, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, they are punished,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s alright.\xe2\x80\x9d Not even\xc2\xa0Jews!\n\nSo the part that is within us, which is human, becomes absolutely troubled when we see some other human being is tortured. Of course, by with these horrible ideas of fanaticism or maybe fear or maybe aggressiveness or whatever it is, we may try to be cruel. If you ask the people of Germany,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9chow do they feel about the massacre?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0they just put down their heads. They said,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We were not ourselves. How we did it we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How it happened we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it worked out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So when the violence is over you just start feeling,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOh God, I am a human being, they were human beings.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So this oneness comes in. The feeling the awareness comes in. It is not so in the animals so much. If they have to work, if they are to be active, they will be together but if something dies they are not bothered. Even if a child, say, of a monkey is sick, the mother will be worried. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be screaming, shouting; but if the thing is dead she will just throw away the child on one side and get up. It\xe2\x80\x99s only the human beings who can feel that oneness. So our awareness\xe2\x80\xa6 this was given to us by Shri Krishna\xe2\x80\x99s advent. He gave us this awareness of human, or He\xc2\xa0keeps\xc2\xa0that awareness within us. We have to accept Him as a Person who gives us this awareness of human relationship. And whenever there has been problem like somebody told Me that in Somnath people believe that Shri Krishna came as to give lessons. So many Hindus believe it was Shri Krishna who came as Mohammed Ghazni to give a lesson to these horrible brahmins who were making money out of that temple. So many Hindus believe that, that to punish these horrible brahmins who were making money, he had to come as Mohammed Ghazni to break that idol which was giving them so much money and they were making all kinds of, you can say, extractions, from the poor devotees who were devoted to that temple. It was only He could do it.\n\nSo we have to understand that when we are not integrated, we cannot feel the integration of our being. We are\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0integrated \xe2\x80\x93 that we have to realise. Our mind works in one way, our heart works in another way, our liver works in another way. As I told you I am quite surprised that when they have told that, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t drink,\xe2\x80\x9d those people who follow these religions still go on drinking. But apart from that, religion forget it, [if] they see a man going into a pub and falling and faltering coming out, still they enter into the same to get to the same situation! Why? Because the mind tells them not to do it; mind says, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d the brain says, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d but their heart is weak \xe2\x80\x93 they cannot. The habits, all the habits come through this kind of disintegration.\n\nWe are so disintegrated within ourselves that if a person wants to do something he just does the opposite of it! And that is the reason why we accept this kind of juxtapositions in life [like with] what was told by Him about music and about everything.. Music has come out of God\xe2\x80\x99s love to us. Anything that is not for God\xe2\x80\x99s love is not music. I will give you an example. There was a lady who used to do some sort of a Qawali and I was on the censor board. I censored her Qawalis and I said,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a Qawali.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0She said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is called as mujarat. This is horribly sensuous and horrible thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s an insult of God. You can\xe2\x80\x99t sing like that.\xe2\x80\x9d So she said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, this is Qawali.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Qawali was never sung by women and was never done in this dirty fashion the way like a prostitute you are singing this Qawali? It\xe2\x80\x99s always all the music was in the praise of God. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Mohammed Sahib said that all the music should be in the praise of God and should not be\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo we had other things like\xc2\xa0Ras\xc2\xa0and all that. But you find even at the time of Shri Krishna all the music was to be just done for\xc2\xa0Ras. Ra, \xe2\x80\x98Ra\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98energy\xe2\x80\x99. Sa means \xe2\x80\x98with\xe2\x80\x99. With Radha they were playing together, playing\xc2\xa0Rasa\xc2\xa0and that\xe2\x80\x99s how they were doing the circulation of the energy to integrate themselves and singing the music. It is for that but you find that people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. They use music for sensuousness: is anti-God. This music force has come to us to praise God, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, for nothing else, [not] for doing all kinds of dirty things and singing all kinds of funny things. Imagine! And the reaction is built in so much. When He said that all the music should be in the name of God, we have a person like Aurangzeb who would not take to any music! He was such a staunchy (sic) fellow and the other Muslims who came in would not sing anything that is Qawali or anything, would sing horrible\xc2\xa0ghazals\xc2\xa0which are just describing the separation of a woman and a man and all kinds of dirty things!\n\nWith this disintegrated temperaments people took to anything that came to them just to please themselves. When the advent of this thing like Omar Khayam. Who is he? He\xe2\x80\x99s anti-God absolutely anti-God man. Horrible! But people appreciate him very much, Omar Khayam what a poetry it is. They appreciate \xe2\x80\x93 why? Because the disintegrated part of their heart likes Omar Khayam when he sings, \xe2\x80\x9cOh we should drink here. What is there in this life? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is going to be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Because Mohammed Sahib has said not to drink, he must sing such a song. This is the poetry of Mr. Omar Khayam, who is being very much respected everywhere. And he\xe2\x80\x99s very much regarded as a great poet in Iraq where today Khomeini is one great horrible man is born and he still respects this Omar Khayam; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how can he respect him. What a contrast it is, just see, what a contrast this Omar Khayam singing dirty songs. They are not in praise of God. Music which is not in the praise of God is not music. Is ashleed. Is filth. Is dirt. Our classical music in India was based on AUM. Even at Kundalini when it reaches here at the Vishuddhi Chakra it makes all the sounds,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cam, aam, em, eem, um, oom, rim, reem, lrim, lreem, aye, ayee, ao, aou, ang, ah\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0All these sixteen vowels are coming from the sixteen chakras or the sub-chakras or the petals of this Vishuddhi Chakra. These are Bija mantras of the Vishuddhi Chakra. All the vowels come from here and when we sing dirty songs we spoil this chakra Vishuddhi.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why all the people who sing these dirty songs have to take to drinking, because I think they can\xe2\x80\x99t bear, or they can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, they can\xe2\x80\x99t sing these bad songs unless and until they take to some sort of an escape from God. So music and drinking started going hand in hand. In the West the music broke all its traditions because they had no sense left in them to recognise that music is meant only for God. Only for hymns to be sung in the praise of God. All music should be in the praise of God. All ragas should be in the praise of God. [In India] we had no\xc2\xa0namaz\xc2\xa0system of different times, but we have a system of music in different times. At different time, a certain music should be played where you describe a mood. And all the moods that are described have to relate themselves to God. There is no other mood that is enjoyable to the Spirit that does not relate to God. There\xe2\x80\x99s no mood which one can enjoy. Even\xc2\xa0bibhatsa,\xc2\xa0the mood of\xc2\xa0bibhatsa\xc2\xa0is grotesque; even that mood one enjoyed, one can listen to when they see the filth and dirt, the left side.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s so scientific; our music system is extremely scientific because it was taken in the form of this music with actually the Kundalini moving into different these\xc2\xa0sapta swaras\xc2\xa0(meaning: 7 notes). These seven\xc2\xa0swaras\xc2\xa0are built in our seven chakras: It start with\xc2\xa0sa, then, re, ga, ma\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Mother, pa, dha, ni.\xc2\xa0My name also starts with\xc2\xa0ni. These seven\xc2\xa0swaras\xc2\xa0are built in with seven notes and there are\xc2\xa0vrikrutis,\xc2\xa0vrikrut\xc2\xa0swaras,\xc2\xa0which are the other, what you call, chakras [so] that we have to make about twelve\xc2\xa0swaras. But nobody understood the real meaning of music.\n\nSharada the Goddess of Saraswati is the one who carries the message of Viraata within and tells us how to sing. She tells us what is appealing to God. How these ragas were made also? Just think of it. Because first they chose the notes the aroha and avrohas, the going up and down (ascending melody and descending melody), which was appealing to God. So the melodies were created. Melodies are fixed. You cannot change the melodies the notes because they found out that, at this point, the Spirit awakened; on the vibrations they found out. They found out that, when they sang this way it worked out. The\xc2\xa0Veena (primordial instrument of Shree Saraswati)\xc2\xa0they played and they found out the exact\xc2\xa0swaras. Exact\xc2\xa0swaras\xc2\xa0which would really make you feel nice. Now, you know that, those people have come from the West, don\xe2\x80\x99t understand any Indian music on the mental level but they understand at the Spiritual level because their Spirits get filled with joy and the vibrations starts flowing.\n\nThe sense of music \xe2\x80\x93 this depiction of music was done by Shri Krishna. It is He the One who taught\xc2\xa0taala. Of course we can say that Shiva is the One who dances the\xc2\xa0taala, but the One who depicted it for human beings who gave the message to the world how the\xc2\xa0taala\xc2\xa0should be is Shri Krishna, through His dancing movements. He kept the\xc2\xa0taala\xc2\xa0all the time. Like the way He stands itself suggests how He kept the\xc2\xa0taala. And He played the\xc2\xa0murli\xc2\xa0(flute) also, to suggest that music is what God\xe2\x80\x99s love is. His music is suggesting of God\xe2\x80\x99s love, that soothes you, that clears you, that makes you happy, that gives you joy. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what He suggested through His singing, through His music. He never wrote any poetry did He? He never wrote any poetry as such but when He spoke, when He spoke in gudria in the prose it became Gita. Just when He spoke it became Gita. Of course, people have tried to spoil quite a lot of it, the rhythm, which I feel sometimes when people recite it. But still we must say when He really created it, it was for human beings to create poetry out of prose. Out of prose He made it communicable. Because people could, first, only understand the music, the rhythm of the music. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand much words and things. But He made it possible.\n\nEven in Koran, if you read, the few words before starting every chapter nobody understands. They are all\xc2\xa0nothing\xc2\xa0but mantra bijas. But they put it there. They knew people won\xe2\x80\x99t understand, but He put it there because people would understand. All these things you may not understand. You may not understand Me either, possibly, but whatever they did was for your\xc2\xa0hitha (benevolence). This is what happened, at the time of Shri Krishna that He established the concept of\xc2\xa0hitha; because it was said that you must speak the Truth and you must speak the thing that is sweet,\xc2\xa0priya (\xe2\x80\x98satyam vade, priyam vade\xe2\x80\x99). It was the message of Shri Krishna that you must speak sweetly. Those people who have got a proper Vishuddhi Chakra speak very sweetly. Their voice has that enchanting method of capturing the hearts of people and not debasing them, but elevating them. So He said you must do it sweetly. That was His main theme. Everything He did so sweetly that He created a\xc2\xa0leela\xc2\xa0out of His doings. It was a\xc2\xa0leela\xc2\xa0that he made. He said this world is not a place where you should be serious, you should be sharp, you should be tense, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a\xc2\xa0leela. Just see the\xc2\xa0leela, the drama. The whole is a drama.\n\nSo the whole thing is very sweet. If you see the whole world as a drama it becomes a sweet thing. The sweetness of it, even if you see a person trying to be funny, you get a joy out of it. If you know it\xe2\x80\x99s a drama you don\xe2\x80\x99t get worried if somebody comes and murders somebody and you know it\xe2\x80\x99s all fake, it\xe2\x80\x99s a drama. It\xe2\x80\x99s a drama going on and that\xe2\x80\x99s what He told people that the whole thing is a\xc2\xa0leela. So that people should not get into serious moods and actually start acting in the drama in the real way. Like, you see, you appoint somebody as, say, Shivaji Maharaj and there is somebody coming from the other side and he takes a sword and he really hits the fellow there! And you say this Shivaji Maharaj actor is no good; he gets absolutely involved into the thing and hits the other person. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a drama and He made it into a\xc2\xa0leela\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0leela \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0because it\xe2\x80\x99s a drama no doubt.\n\nBut when, when you get realised you start seeing the drama and the play and the whole thing is, you must have seen that most of the Sahaja Yogis are always laughing, because they see the way things are happening. Even when they see a guru misbehaving or something they just feel like laughing \xe2\x80\x93 how absurd it is. Like somebody came today to talk to Me and he told Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I have been to all kinds of nonsensical things.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0And he was just laughing. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI laugh at them now what I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI went to one guru who is going to \xe2\x80\x93 who used to give name to people; say this naama (name/mantra), that naam. I made such efforts, I went to people, recommended my case.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Because he was not so rich, you see, so he was never bought the name and he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me the name. I must have the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0And the guru was saying;\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no, no. You have to wait three\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9dHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI poured so much money in his\xc2\xa0savapati\xc2\xa0and which were large\xc2\xa0savapatis\xc2\xa0were put. I did everything, but he would not give me a name and ultimately when it came to that he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a name,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0and he gave me a name which I started taking. I really became mad after that. I started getting headaches, this, that! Then he said;\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlright you have to suffer! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer you must go through it. Yes you must. You asked for the name so you have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0And when he came to Me, he was looking like nothing on Earth, I tell you. In a very funny shape he came to Me. But now he\xe2\x80\x99s completely cured. I could not even\xc2\xa0recognise\xc2\xa0him the other day I just saw him. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh God are you the same person?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother now I laugh at all these things and I just see that how people are stupid to go to these false people, follow false ideas and false conceptions and how they are missing the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0And he asked Me a question, \xe2\x80\x9cHave they to go to that limit of destruction to come to You?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about them what they have decided.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0But it is true that people are\xc2\xa0so\xc2\xa0stupid that they take to all these ideas and all these negative things much more easily than to the positive things \xe2\x80\x93 because of the Vishuddhi Chakra being spoilt.\n\nIf your Vishuddhi Chakra is not spoilt, your hands are working better. Many people who get Realisation do not feel vibrations in the hands, because their Vishuddhi Chakras are not alright. Now what does that mean that your Vishuddhi Chakra is not alright? First of all by temperament you are not a collective person \xe2\x80\x93 by temperament. You are not a person who enjoys collectivity much. Like people who are fussy.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI want this. I want that. I want to sleep on a proper bed. I must have this. I must do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0This kind of an \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99; those who have too much \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 in them because both the ego and super-ego start from this Vishuddhi Chakra. You see a man who is an egoistical person is not able to see the collectivity at all, because he is separated with the rest of them. His\xc2\xa0ahamkara\xc2\xa0(ego) covers his being so much that he cannot enjoy the collectivity.\n\nNow you see Shri Krishna lived with whom? With gopis who were little, little boys. He went and used to look after His cows; just looking after the cows. None of these incarnations you will find were interested in rich people or anything. He went and stayed with people who were very ordinary from the worldly point of view and there He played and there He did all these tricks of sweetness. He used to steal the butter. He used to steal the butter, and many people who are criticising Him always say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh He was a thief. Yes He was a thief. He was the thief of the thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0And so on. He used to steal the butter because this butter was taken to Mathura by these ladies to get some money. And that was giving more help to all these horrible rakshasas who were in Mathura, so He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want this to go there and give them this good health. The best thing was to steal the butter so they don\xe2\x80\x99t get it and they starve on their\xe2\x80\xa6they have their deficiencies of the vitamin A and D, you can call it. And that they suffer from bad throat and they have no strength in their hands when they pick up their swords. So this was the way to hit them so that they could not fight the forces of good. So, in that, He proved that a higher goal is to be achieved by giving up smaller, silly, stupid goals. The\xc2\xa0hitha,\xc2\xa0hitha\xc2\xa0is the main thing, because when He said that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t speak the truth, otherwise people will be hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Alright, so what should you do? You hurt the people so you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak the truth, or you speak the truth you hurt the people. So both cannot go together. Like if I tell somebody, \xe2\x80\x9cOh you are so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0That person gets hurt. Now if I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell that person, that person is lost. So what to do? He found out the solution so He said, He put, the word in between as \xe2\x80\x98hitha\xe2\x80\x99. The word \xe2\x80\x98hitha\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0means \xe2\x80\x93 good to your Spirit, whatever is good for your Spirit.\xc2\xa0Hitha\xc2\xa0word means\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0good for your Spirit. It has nothing to do with material things. It means for your Spirit. For example, if I tell somebody that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not do that\xe2\x80\x9d,\xc2\xa0he may feel bad today, but if he recognises that, \xe2\x80\x9cMother is telling me for my good,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0he will do it and he will gain by that in his\xc2\xa0hitha. Or else if he does not do it, later on \xe2\x80\x93 supposing I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him and if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it, or even if I tell him [and] he does not do it \xe2\x80\x93 he is going to feel bad. So it is not\xc2\xa0priya\xc2\xa0(pleasing) to his Spirit. It is not\xc2\xa0priya\xc2\xa0to him.\n\nSo if you do something that is the\xc2\xa0hitha\xc2\xa0of a person, sometimes you have to tell a person, sometimes it may look very, very painful. The other day I told somebody that, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t cure anybody because you\xe2\x80\x99re not strong enough to cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0He felt very hurt. So then I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright go ahead. You better cure others, but don\xe2\x80\x99t come back to Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Then he\xe2\x80\x99ll land up in a lunatic asylum. But when he\xe2\x80\x99ll land up in the lunatic asylum then what will he say? Was that for his\xc2\xa0hitha\xc2\xa0that I said? Will he be then angry? So ultimately if you say the\xc2\xa0hitha, say. Saying is the point. Not doing, saying. You say the\xc2\xa0hithawith your Vishuddhi Chakra then ultimately it becomes\xc2\xa0priya\xc2\xa0(pleasing). Means it is light. So you say a thing which is good for the Spirit, otherwise you just don\xe2\x80\x99t say. But people just say to others to correct them because they are aggressive. It should be done in love.\xc2\xa0Hitha\xc2\xa0means: done something in love. If you want to say something to someone in love and you feel it is necessary and the third condition you must have\xc2\xa0adikar: you must have the right to say it to the person. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right you just keep quiet. Let God look after. You are not in charge of anyone. But if you have to say to someone in love and if you have an\xc2\xa0adikara\xc2\xa0then you have to say it. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the adikar you should not say anything to anyone unless and until it is\xc2\xa0absolutely\xc2\xa0priya to that person involving his\xc2\xa0hitha. This is what He put, that you should not do any\xc2\xa0anadikar\xc2\xa0cheshta. Means you should not do something unauthorised.\n\nLike I would say somebody comes to Me and says that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that person whom I want to murder?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Then what is the truth? Should I tell him, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright this is the truth. You go and kill that person\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0According to the strict government law it may be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the government laws at all, or the human laws. But it is not. Then what do you have to tell him? You just keep quiet. He has no\xc2\xa0adikar, he has no right, to ask you or to get this information from you. You just keep quiet. I do. Then he may beat you \xe2\x80\x93 do anything. You just say, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0It is\xc2\xa0anadikarcheshta. It is done many a times. People who are, say, great nationalists who fight for their country and people want to extract information from them. They suffer. Suffer. But they will not give the information. Not out of fear, but out of love of their fellow men who are fighting for the freedom of their country. This has been done in our country many a times. So you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak something which is not the adikara of another. He has no right to ask this question. Like that, one has to be very discreet and that is what Shri Krishna has given us \xe2\x80\x93 His discretion.\n\nMany people ask Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, then in this situation, what should I do? In that situation what should I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0That means the person has not developed a Vishuddhi Chakra to be discreet: he has not evolved, he is not mature enough, he is still asking Me questions. In the\xc2\xa0nirvikalpa state\xc2\xa0you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask Me any questions, you know exactly what is to be done: when to shout at somebody, when to be quiet, when to be silent, when to say something and how far to go. All these qualities develop through proper Vishuddhi Chakra, because you are doing it for the\xc2\xa0hitha\xc2\xa0of another person. Sometimes it pays much more to keep quiet. This is what He has taught us. Not only taught us but He has put it within us the discretion part in our Vishuddhi Chakra. He has put within us the power to witness the drama, to be detached. He was\xc2\xa0Yogeshwara. He was\xc2\xa0Yogeshwara. He was the Ishwara of yoga. He was the One who was the giver of yoga \xe2\x80\x93 naturally \xe2\x80\x93 because Shiva is the One to be achieved. But the One who helps us is\xc2\xa0Him, Is Akbar, is the Mahalakshmi Tattwa, is the central path which takes you to Shiva. So He is the One who takes us there. It is He who is supported by all the prophets. He works out this for you \xe2\x80\x93 this great work of evolution.\n\nSo, one can understand very clearly that, if our Vishuddhi Chakra is put right, we develop exactly how to be discreet in Sahaja Yoga. We devise a method by which we talk so much that makes people feel\xc2\xa0priya\xc2\xa0that they appreciate, they like it \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0priya. It\xe2\x80\x99s loving and also it does their\xc2\xa0hitha. Even sometimes you have to say something which is harsh or maybe your silence may make them feel a little harsh, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It will give them\xc2\xa0ultimately\xc2\xa0their\xc2\xa0hitha. So the ultimate goal is\xc2\xa0hitha. That\xe2\x80\x99s what Krishna had in His mind, to do the\xc2\xa0hitha.\n\nSo, His\xc2\xa0Samhara Shakti\xc2\xa0also which He had \xe2\x80\x93 the killing \xe2\x80\x93 many people criticise Him for that. Like the Jains you see. At the time of Shri Krishna He had a cousin called\xc2\xa0Neminath;\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Neminath\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0Shri Krishna, he was just an ordinary human being who had achieved certain heights in evolution. He just got filled up with a kind of a feeling of a repulsion about killing animals. Of course, killing animals is not a very good thing, but he was not killing and it was to be done for his marriage. So he developed such a strong feeling about it that he started a different thing called Jainism. Some sort of another path, in which he said that there should be no killing of animals. It so became so ridiculously funny, that it reached a stage where bugs became more important than human beings, even mosquitoes were more important! You see those people walking with this thing covered on their faces and on the street. Everything taken to the\xc2\xa0last\xc2\xa0nonsense!\n\nSo Shri Krishna gives you discretion and this was\xc2\xa0very, very, very, very, very\xc2\xa0important because all our problems of disintegration disappear when we have discretion. But mostly people don\xe2\x80\x99t have their Vishuddhi alright. On the one side there\xe2\x80\x99s a Right Vishuddhi which gives us aggressiveness: With our talk we aggress others. Most of the politicians have that kind of a capacity. But if they get mediums into them like supra-conscious, like Hitler had\xe2\x80\xa6He learnt it from some Tibetan lamas who taught them these all dirty tricks of overpowering people. He managed to put such Spirits into them that they killed thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of human beings. The Left Vishuddhi is another problem. Such people also don\xe2\x80\x99t have a collectivity sense because they are frightened of others. They are so negative they always see the negative side of another person. I have seen people who come and tell Me about every Sahaja Yogi, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. This is wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0No positive points at all! They only see the negative point. So they have no collectivity. They always have fear. All the time they are frightened of others because there\xe2\x80\x99s something in them that frightens\xc2\xa0them. So they have their Left Vishuddhi very badly caught up because they are guilty \xe2\x80\x93 specially in the West, you will be surprised: who are supposed to be such aggressive people!\xc2\xa0They\xc2\xa0have terrible Left Vishuddhi, because they, by their doing, build up a very big guilt within themselves. They see how they have been behaving, their community has been behaving, their country has been behaving [so] they develop a big guilt in their mind. Moreover, as Brian has told you, that it is cut \xe2\x80\x93 the roots are cut and you start behaving in an anti-God manner, even without realising that it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. The Left Vishuddhi comes up because they feel guilty, despite their doing wrong things with the knowledge that they are doing the right thing. They feel guilty because in the sub-conscious the conscience of a person works it out and that guilt is accumulating howsoever you may deny it, but the left side goes on catching and they have a Left Vishuddhi [catch]. So, one has to say that, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am not guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s another side of ego where the ego\xe2\x80\x99s reaction hides itself into Left Vishuddhi. And with that they start feeling guilty, \xe2\x80\x9cI should not have done that. I should not have done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Both attitudes are wrong. When you are on the left side you aggress yourself and torture yourself and when you are on the right side you torture others and aggress them.\n\nSo to be in the centre is only possible if your Vishuddhi Chakra is alright, otherwise you cannot. You have seen many people when they get Realisation they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel vibrations on both the hands equally. The reason is they have no balance: it shows on the hands [that] they have no balance. Now hands are a very important part of human beings after Sahaja Yoga. If your hands do not have equal, equal vibrations, then something wrong with you. Whatever side you do not have vibrations, say, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have vibrations right side or you feel that right side is heavy, or is hot, then definitely you are right-sided person. In such cases maybe left side is absolutely numb. Those people [who] have numb left side, means also they are right sided. But in the left hand if you have more vibrations and on the right hand you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any, then also it means that you are right sided, not that you are left sided. But on the other side if you have the other way round then you are a left sided person. That means the balance is not there. Your hand says that there should be balance. So you must know that only by thinking, you are not going to get rid of your troubles in Sahaja Yoga \xe2\x80\x93 you have to work with your hands. As I told you that just by thinking you can\xe2\x80\x99t drive your car, you have to use your hands. You have to use your hands with full knowledge as to where you are, what you are and what would these vibrations mean. You have to use your hands. Now when you start using your hands for all practical purposes other people might start thinking,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThese people have gone mad! They are using their hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0But the same way they thought when Mohammed Sahib taught them to use their hands. They all laughed at\xc2\xa0Him! But now nobody is ashamed of it, nobody laughs at it, but they are doing all mechanically \xe2\x80\x93 not the way He has said.\n\nSo first of all use these hands for your own purpose, for yourself. These same hands can help you. Now the Kundalini has awakened; so it is passing through all the centres in a very thin way maybe, but it is there. So first raise it more and more. You can do it with your hands. It\xe2\x80\x99s a [virtuous] circle \xe2\x80\x93 when your hands raise it, it starts flowing\xc2\xa0more\xc2\xa0in your hands. Only your hands can raise it. It starts flowing in your hands. Giving yourself a\xc2\xa0bandhanor raise yourself \xe2\x80\x93 raise your Kundalini. Learn all these methods\xc2\xa0carefully. Your hands are very important. If your hands are not working you be careful on that. You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with. Some people who have had problems with their hands, because of previous life or some sort of a thing, they feel their chakras in the \xe2\x80\x93 their own places. Then after sometime, you\xe2\x80\x99ll start feeling your chakras in your brain \xe2\x80\x93 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You will never feel anything uncomfortable with it. You will be able to manage. After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You don\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything. You just say,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Finished! They just know. That also \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 comes through your Vishuddhi and you just say it, again say it.\n\nThe most important function of the Vishuddhi Chakra is that it should be pure and clean because if you have to say mantras your Vishuddhi has to be clean. All the mantras have to have the help of Vishuddhi. When a guru gives a mantra, first thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll find he will have a Left Vishuddhi catch and any other chakra whatever the chakra the guru has attacked. But first will be on the Left Vishuddhi, so for that we use the mantra of\xc2\xa0mantrasiddhi.\xc2\xa0The\xc2\xa0mantrasiddhi\xc2\xa0comes on a person when his Left Vishuddhi is alright, otherwise he cannot be\xc2\xa0mantrasiddhi. Whatever mantras they say is all mechanical. Your Left Vishuddhi should be alright if you have to say the mantras in a proper way to be effective to have enlightened mantras. Even\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAllah ho Akbar\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0has no meaning if your Left Vishuddhi is not alright. So you will see how, in Sahaja Yoga, Left Vishuddhi is important and Right Vishuddhi is important for vibrations.\n\nSo Vishuddhi Chakra plays a tremendous part, role in, in Sahaja Yoga because it connects you to the Viraat, to the Whole. So you come to the point where you know that it is through Vishuddhi Chakra [that] you know the Whole, the Akbar; you get connected with\xc2\xa0Him. The rapport is established through Vishuddhi Chakra and you can feel it; it\xe2\x80\x99s communicated. The rapport may be, supposing the hands are cut, still you might get your Realisation. Many get it. But if you do not have your hands intact, then the communication is poor. Then maybe on your chakras you will start developing the communication later on. But this is the easiest way to feel the communication in your hands, if your hands are sensitive. So what should we do to keep the Vishuddhi Chakra [clean] is the problem. I have been told that I should finish My lecture soon and go away soon! But I think I should finish this today about Vishuddhi Chakra.\n\nWhat should we do to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra alright? Steal the butter and eat it. You must eat butter because it has vitamin A and D. Vitamin D especially, I am sorry, vitamin D. So that calcium grows in your body. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll become a strong person. If you just take calcium without butter then there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. So try to take butter whenever you have Vishuddhi Chakra problem, for physical side; I\xe2\x80\x99m just telling about this. You can take some butter in water, hot water; spread it on and take it. Vishuddhi Chakra looks after the cooling side \xe2\x80\x93 cooling side \xe2\x80\x93 because the liver, when it gives heat, the body becomes heated up. Then the one that really cools it down is the Vishuddhi Chakra and when you have a problem on the, on the drying of the epithelial cells inside, the lining, then best thing is to take some butter in the water, or eat some butter during summer time. But no carbohydrates with it, no carbohydrates. Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t put on weight. You eat as much as you like \xe2\x80\x93 butter. You will not put on weight. If you can give up carbohydrates completely you will have\xc2\xa0satvikahara\xc2\xa0(balanced diet) absolutely. You should not touch carbohydrates and you will be amazed that you will have\xc2\xa0satvikahara. Take butter and proteins. Take all fats, cream, everything. Nothing will go wrong with you. You can take for proteins all dried fruits, everything and just take this honey for sweet. No carbohydrates. Or also these days honey is made out of sugar as you know. So if you can avoid carbohydrates and just take these things your health will be alright.\n\nBut we have [different] patients; we have all kinds of imbalances. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I say,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlright, if you have a liver, take sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0But if you just give up sugar it is not going to help. You have to first correct your liver and then you can give up sugar very easily. No problem. But not before that, like all the doctors in general say, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t take sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The fat goes out of the body just giving the lining of the body, the softness, and goes out of the body. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay because, if there are no carbohydrates, it cannot be retained in the body. You can see at home. You put some butter on your hand. Alright? And wash it. It won\xe2\x80\x99t wash. It will just stick there. It will have no effect \xe2\x80\x93 nothing, but it will be just sticking out there. It cannot be consumed. But if you put some carbohydrate say put some\xc2\xa0atta\xc2\xa0(flour) or something you can take it out; it dissolves. It cannot be dissolved if you do not take carbohydrates.\n\nBut this is for people who do not have any imbalances in the body, who are perfectly alright; they can do it. I can do it but nobody allows Me. Everybody uses Me for feeding as if I am a wastepaper basket. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat\xe2\x80\xa6 you see you are supposed to give Mother something like an ayurveda this much. But I have seen people when they want to give Me they\xe2\x80\x99ll give Me so much and if I eat a little they\xe2\x80\x99ll feel that, \xe2\x80\x9coh what Mother is \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t need it actually! People should understand My nature. So when they serve Me, they\xe2\x80\x99ll serve so much that I cannot eat. I just eat little. I can manage. There is no need for Me to eat carbohydrates at all \xe2\x80\x93 at all. I need not have carbohydrates. But,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMother I have made this. Please have it. Mother I have made these ladoos (round sweets). Please have it. Mother I have\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0So I say; \xe2\x80\x9cAlright Baba!\xe2\x80\x9d Now I have to suffer to please you people, for\xc2\xa0priya. This is what is very simple to understand that you should not\xc2\xa0force\xc2\xa0Me to eat, at all. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to force Me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t force anyone to eat. Though I\xc2\xa0do\xc2\xa0force people to eat because I know they need it but\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0cannot do it; you have no discretion. When you have discretion, whom to force, whom not to force, then it\xe2\x80\x99s alright. Also when you force you must know that the food has to be vibrated. If it is not vibrated food, if you force the person, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have trouble.\n\nNow for all of you to understand the importance of Vishuddhi Chakra is first and foremost thing is that when you speak you must speak about Sahaja Yoga and nothing else. If you have to give speech \xe2\x80\x93 I have known many Sahaja Yogis, you see, who are still member of this organisation, member of that organisation, member of this thing; of horrible organisations which are anti God. Say now, for example, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see \xe2\x80\x9cHare rama hare krishna\xe2\x80\x9d organisation is anti-Christ, anti. It is of course anti-Christ openly, and in the real sense is anti-Krishna \xe2\x80\x93 absolutely [anti] Krishna. Every person who goes there and begs in the name of God has a\xc2\xa0horrible\xc2\xa0Vishuddhi and they all suffer ultimately from Vishuddhi troubles \xe2\x80\x93 cancer, this, that and they die. And the face of a person who has a good Vishuddhi is blooming, is wide, is full of\xe2\x80\xa6 full like a full moon. And if you have a face which is all shut down that means your Vishuddhi is not alright. If the Vishuddhi is functioning when there has to be glow on the face; the face should be full and nourished and sparkling and eyes should be sparkling because Vishuddhi Chakra also looks after the eyes. It looks after the neck. It looks after the ears. It looks after the nose. If your Vishuddhi Chakras are spoiled you have problems with all E.N.T. (Ear Nose Throat) things. So the people who are like that; like this you see we can say the man who was the leader of that organisation. They think they are doing \xe2\x80\x9cHare rama hare krishna\xe2\x80\x9d: actually they are doing absolutely anti-Krishna activities \xe2\x80\x93 absolutely! You have no business to call Krishna\xe2\x80\x99s name like this, like mad! Standing before all the people, wearing these horrible dresses of these\xc2\xa0dhoti\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0kurtas; and which they are absolutely done in a very funny way. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to wear it; the women wearing their saris and men buying those bhodis and putting them on their head and shaving their heads. Did Krishna shave His head? Did He ever shave His head? Head, the hair, are actually the part of Krishna\xe2\x80\x99s gift. On the contrary He, His hair are always described, always described in the poetry.\n\nThere is a story about a great Urdu poet who was an Indian; who was a Hindu, but Urdu poet. And some fanatics, you see, challenged him. So they put one couplet and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou better complete this\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9dKaafir hai woh bandhe jo nahin Islam ke\xe2\x80\x9d (He is an infidel who does not believe in Islam\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0So he completed it by saying \xe2\x80\x9dIslam ke mafiq hai Yeshu mere Ghanshyam ke, Kaafir hai woh bandhe jo nahin Islam ke\xe2\x80\x9d (Just like Islam, is my Jesu like my Ghanshyam, He is an infidel who does not believe in Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d His hair are described in every poetry are used. Here they are shaving their heads, putting these bhodies on their heads and walking about. When did Krishna have [a] bald head? Did He have a bald head? He is\xc2\xa0Yogeshwara\xc2\xa0with sixteen thousand wives; means sixteen thousand powers. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Sahaja Yogis to work out so He got them as wives. They were all yoginis within. He created all this drama and He got them as wives because a man, if he has any women as disciples, then naturally he is blamed and as a man he has to have powers in the women. Women are always the power, the shakti. So they came as His wives and He became the husband of sixteen thousand wives and the five\xc2\xa0ranis (queens)\xc2\xa0He had were the five elements within Him. He played all the tricks. He created\xe2\x80\xa6..you you how will you know about Him? How far can you go [in] understanding Him? So these people who are trying to call Shri Krishna every moment, every minute, standing on the streets and begging in His name. All over the places begging like beggars. Krishna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand begging at all,\xc2\xa0never. He believed in having a right. He would [rather] steal than to beg. All these beggars being created in the name of God: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the greatest sins to beg in the name of God. I have seen this happening before the temples and all that and I used to think, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the temple in front of God to stand and beg. To be a fakir means to beg? What is this?\xe2\x80\x9d Is this the sign of a basha. Shri Krishna was a\xc2\xa0batshawa,\xc2\xa0Yogeshwara\xc2\xa0and these beggars, they are the followers of Shri Krishna? Horrible things. They look so miserable and they are absolutely like cabbages and many people believe that they are in peace. Naturally if you are living in a\xc2\xa0smashana\xc2\xa0(cremation ground) you are in peace; in a dead condition. And our country, which is a poor country \xe2\x80\x93 supporting all these beggars here! All our rich people have given them money and lands. Is this the way we are going to support these lamas who come down from there and these horrible people coming down from the West? All the people who cannot work? Very nice! Come here, say, \xe2\x80\x9chare rama hare krishna\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0and read Gita and say some few words by heart and then you earn your living here! Nicely living. Every village there is one or two sitting there and begging. Can you believe it? And our government is not bothered about it; to find out who are these people, why are they here, in the name of God why are they begging like this. And we have so many poor people who are begging in the name of God. Why not collect them and help them instead of helping these horrible people? Like this, you see, people have anti God activities and anti Krishna activities. When you take the name of God in vain \xe2\x80\x93 Vishuddhi catches. I have known people sitting \xe2\x80\x98warguru warguru warguru\xe2\x80\x99 Is it so [that] Nanak Sahib is so cheap that we should go on taking His name, \xe2\x80\x9cwarguru warguru warguru?\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99ll go on having the mala in the hand all the time. What is this going on? What do you think God to be? Is He in your pocket? Is He so cheaply available that you just go on doing all these things? Why? You spoil your Vishuddhi completely. One must understand. When\xe2\x80\xa6 you see, you are surprised at\xe2\x80\xa6 It is said that, \xe2\x80\x9c...\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Still people start doing it. Karaka means what? Vishuddhi Chakra. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you spoil your Vishuddhi Chakra. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you spoil your main chakra of attaining Realisation. So if you have to become one with the whole, please try to keep your Vishuddhi Chakra clear. Getting into colds because these days India especially\xe2\x80\xa6any, everywhere even in\xe2\x80\xa6 women have a special tendency not to cover their body because they think they are not looking very fashionable or whatever it is. Is a very modern stuff has started that they want to wear scanty dresses. This is all anti God in both ways. Firstly it is nonsensical to show off your body. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Mohammed Sahib said \xe2\x80\x93 you see He has worked so much on Vishuddhi Chakra \xe2\x80\x93 that women should cover their body. Is a very good thing I sometimes think. This nonsense of fashion has gone to such a limit that after some time you\xe2\x80\x99ll find all these mosquitoes walking around without any clothes. That\xe2\x80\x99s the ultimate. You see is a sign of people who are, who are neither \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99 nor \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99. The \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99 people do that way. Yes always. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99 are the people who have qualities. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Rajneesh, when people go to them, they become \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99. Because that is their capacity: no shame at all left in them. And that is what it is, one has to understand that you should be careful about your throats.\n\nThe fashions and all these things are not so important. What is important is your health. If you spoil your Vishuddhi it\xe2\x80\x99s a very wrong thing and one should try to look after Vishuddhi all the time and all of you should try to look after each other\xe2\x80\x99s Vishuddhi. Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of having this pandal here and I told the organisers this was a wrong thing. So they said;\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYou said it should be in the open.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying you go to Himalayas.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0You must use discretion, that\xe2\x80\x99s the part missing. You must have discretion. To give people a thing in the mid-winter, such a place I mean \xe2\x80\x93 I must say you people are great seekers to be here \xe2\x80\x93 this is not proper thing to do. So the organisers, the people who are dealing with the collectivity must know that they should do something to protect the throat of people, to protect the\xc2\xa0Vishuddhi\xc2\xa0chakra. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important,\xc2\xa0veryimportant. And you all know how I care for your Vishuddhi Chakras, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s Vishuddhi Chakra, because I know how important it is. Because it will make you\xc2\xa0absolutely\xc2\xa0disintegrated and it will spoil all the work of Kundalini and poor Kundalini will suffer also. So we have to take it upon ourselves that we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep our Vishuddhi Chakra clean, we\xe2\x80\x99ll clean ourselves properly and we\xe2\x80\x99ll clean our throats every morning and we\xe2\x80\x99ll take gargling and everything and look after our Vishuddhi Chakra. It looks very mundane but for a Mother mundane things are as important as higher things are, because if there is no Vishuddhi Chakra what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga with a bad Vishuddhi Chakra?\n\nSo please try to look after your Vishuddhi Chakra. Try to put\xc2\xa0Yogeshwara\xc2\xa0there. Try to raise Shri Krishna there, try to be like Him. Keep your understanding that you are here to witness the drama of God and to be the\xc2\xa0murli(flute)\xc2\xa0of Shri Krishna to watch the beautiful melody flowing through you. May God bless you all.\n\nNow today also they don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to touch My feet. I hope today you will obey without any exception. Yesterday we tried but there were exceptions so today there should be no apowadas. Let us see. One day we should not touch Mother\xe2\x80\x99s feet. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You all can touch from there, and there is a way of collectively touching Mother\xe2\x80\x99s feet is the way we do always. You can all do it just now but we need not actually touch, but you are actually touching. Even touching the Mother Earth you are touching. Just touch the Mother Earth and you are there. Just touch the Mother Earth; you will find the Kundalini rising.\n\nYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t given Me any questions whatsoever and those who have questions should write questions and give it to Me, because once I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away then you will say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother never allowed us to ask any questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0I did say there are\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n*******\n\n[Explanation then follows in Hindi] After 1h17 questions and answers in Hindi, (for about 40 minutes)\n\nShree Mataji \xe2\x80\x93 What is it.\xc2\xa0 Read it aloud.\n\nShree Mataji, should we do the Shraadh ceremony for the Pitras. (A ritual in honour, and for the benefit of deceased souls of the forefathers). And should we keep their photographs. I asked about this the other day.\n\nShree Mataji \xe2\x80\x93 They have asked the question, should we keep photos of the pitras (forefathers), and should we do the Shraadh ceremony.\xc2\xa0 When thirteen days have passed we should do the Shraadh ceremony.\xc2\xa0 In Shraadh also the question of discretion comes in.\xc2\xa0 In Sahaja Yoga if anyone finds the right heart is catching, it can mean that your father, who has died, his soul is not yet in peace. So in this case you should perform the Shraadh.\xc2\xa0 But it should be done in Sahaja Yoga style.\xc2\xa0 Not in the way that people do ... by calling a brahmin and feeding him.\n\nOnce in Lucknow it happened that for one of the ancestors, Shraad had not been done, so we decided to do the Shraadh.\xc2\xa0 They asked what is the vidhi (system of rite) that you follow.\xc2\xa0 So I said we cook food and serve it to everybody.\xc2\xa0 That is our way\xc2\xa0 of doing Shraadh.\xc2\xa0 My sister-in-law who was very traditional in her beliefs, wanted to call five brahmins.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9dFive! I cant even find one brahmin!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 She said \xe2\x80\x9dNo, we have five brahmins whom we can call\xe2\x80\x9d, so I said \xe2\x80\x9dAlright, call them\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nFive people came. They were neither realised, nor were they brahmin.\xc2\xa0 Five men came and sat and I thought lets see how they perform the Shraadh.\xc2\xa0 When I asked them what we should do, they said, \xe2\x80\x9dNothing.\xc2\xa0 Just bring for each one of us, five kilos of Kalakand (a rich milk confection). I said alright, it sounds very easy.\xc2\xa0 In those days the cost of Kalakand was between Rs.10/- or Rs.5/- per kilo, and to spend Rs.25/- for each person was quite expensive, since we were government employees and not very rich.\xc2\xa0 But I thought, if this is going to please my sister-in-law let us get it.\n\nWe brought 25 kilos and gave 5 kilos to each brahmin.\xc2\xa0 I thought they would pack and take it home, but they opened the donas (leaf packing) and, without thinking of family or children, they sat and ate the whole thing \xe2\x80\x93 five kilos each, and I could only look on in amazement.\xc2\xa0 My sister-in-law was very happy and satisfied that the forefathers would be at peace seeing the brahmins being fed very well.\n\nI said \xe2\x80\x9dJiji, would our forefathers have been able to eat five kilos of Kalakand at one sitting?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The brahmins said, \xe2\x80\x9dWhat is five kilos for us!\xe2\x80\x9d Now we will go to another house and eat; and tomorrow we will go again to other houses, and eat like this.\xc2\xa0 So I said, \xe2\x80\x9dReally! I grant it to you that you are genuine brahmins.\xc2\xa0 Excuse Me, and let us know if there were any shortcomings in the Shraad!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They said,\xe2\x80\x9dIt is complete.\xc2\xa0 We never eat less than five kilos\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 And we let them go.\n\nThis kind of Shraadh is not to be done.\xc2\xa0 There is a protocol even for Shraadh.\n\nThere is another story of a Sahaja Yogi who was a so-called brahmin; but who became a real brahmin (realised soul) after coming to Sahaja Yoga.\xc2\xa0 He was from Maharashtra; and mostly when Maharashtrians get their realisation, they go all out to correct the misconception among the so called brahmin community.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, when a Christian comes into Sahaja Yoga and sees the reality of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s teachings; he also gets after the Christian community.\xc2\xa0 When Sardarjis (Sikhs) come in, they feel that they have to correct the Sikh sardars.\xc2\xa0 And it is a right attitude. If you really care for your brothers then you will want to give them self realisation and correct them.\xc2\xa0 So this is what happens.\n\nThere was a brahmin with us, who after realisation became a real brahmin; and now he is after all the brahmins.\xc2\xa0 His mother told him one day that it was his father\xe2\x80\x99s death anniversary, and we have to do a Shraadh.\xc2\xa0 So go and get a brahmin.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9dI will not go and get any brahmin.\xc2\xa0 There are no brahmins\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 So she said, \xe2\x80\x9dNo, no.\xc2\xa0 This is a family brahmin\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 In those days there were family barbers, family bangle sellers, who served families on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 So she asked him to go and get him.\n\nSo he went, and told the brahmin, \xe2\x80\x9dI do not believe in this Shraadh ritual, but my mother has sent me so I have come to call you\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 The brahmin said, \xe2\x80\x9dAlright. You fix Thursday (Guruvaar) for the Shraadh\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 The Sahaja yogi asked him whether Tuesday would be a better day, but the brahmin insisted that Thursday is a very auspicious day, and he had consulted the Panchang (book of auspicious days and times), and it should be fixed for Thursday.\n\nThe Sahaja Yogi came home and consulted the Panchaang. (In Maharashtra every home has a panchaang because they know how to interpret the Sanskrit language).\xc2\xa0 In that it was written that on Thursdays, (Guruvar) , Shraadh is \xe2\x80\x9dNishidh\xe2\x80\x9d (prohibited), and never to be done on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 So he did the Shraadh on Tuesday according to the Sahaja way.\xc2\xa0 The Brahmin,(who must have had another appointment on Tuesday), arrived on Thursday and started giving the list of things to be bought.\xc2\xa0 But the Sahaja Yogi told him he would get nothing, not even a cup of tea; and he should leave.\xc2\xa0 When he asked the reason, the Sahaja Yogi showed him the panchaang which said that Thursday was most inauspicious for a Shraadh.\xc2\xa0 He told him to see for himself, and that in fact he had performed the Shraadh ceremony on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 So he was asked to leave.\xc2\xa0 The mother felt sorry, and asked her son to at least give him a glass of milk.\xc2\xa0 The son said, \xe2\x80\x9dNo! And this brahmin should never come here again for any ceremonies in future\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSo this is not the kind of Shraadh to be done for the benevolence of the forefathers.\xc2\xa0 It has no meaning.\n\nShree Mataji - Second question was whether we should keep photographs of dead relatives.\xc2\xa0 There is no harm in keeping photographs if you are not involved with it.\xc2\xa0 We must understand that they have left this world, and they have to take a rebirth.\xc2\xa0 So if a photo is kept, and we start doing aartis and pujas to it; or we keep crying and weeping in front of it; then better to put it away.\xc2\xa0 If the attitude towards the photo is that this was my father, or mother, and now he or she is no more; and no attachment is there, then it is OK. There is no problem.\xc2\xa0 But mostly I have seen, that every time one looks at the photo, the whole attention and conversation is on that departed person.\xc2\xa0 If this is happening, then dont keep the photograph outside.\xc2\xa0 Because it is disturbing the attention.\xc2\xa0 Again the question of discretion is to be used.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion: Should women do the Vrat (fasting) of Karvachauth?\nShri Mataji: Do not do any kind of fasting (vrat). The question is Should women do fasting of karvachauth. I have seen women doing this kind of fasting. They get too distressed. Do not do it. If you can do it without any problem, then it is ok. In Sahaja Yoga there is\xc2\xa0 no need to put God in trouble by torturing yourself. No need to do it after Realisation. All their husbands will remain healthy. And if\xc2\xa0 the husband is a Sahaja yogi then there is no problem at all. No need to do that.\n\nEveryone says Parvatiji did this severe fast of karvachauth. But She did it before marriage. Not after marriage. What is the need to do it after you get married?\n\nThe most important protocol of karvachauth is to understand and recognise your husband, and respect him as your husband. Understand him and take good care of him. Try to\xc2\xa0 understand them, what are they. They are like children. Many a times their behavior is like a child. For small small things they will get disturbed and upset. And also their ego cools down very fast. You should see it and learn all these things about them.\xc2\xa0 Be loving towards them;\xc2\xa0 talk sweetly with them. Give them happiness. This is the real karvachauth. Not that during the karvachauth fast\xc2\xa0 you have angry thoughts about him and call him names. So once again the matter of discretion comes up.\n\nActually\xc2\xa0 I have not seen karvachauth being observed properly by most women. If they do the fast,\xc2\xa0 their attention is all the time on when they will see the moon, and when can they break their fast.\xc2\xa0 They are so overcome with hunger, that they start troubling every one with their impatience.\xc2\xa0 What is the need for such a kind of fast.\n\nThis fast should be done by unmarried girls, praying\xc2\xa0 to get a husband like Shri Shiva. But first of all, are you like Shree Parvati ? First make yourself like Shree Parvatiji, and then desire for a husband like Shri Shiva. It is not an easy task to handle a husband like Shri Shiva, Who sits on bull. Shri Shiva cannot be the husband of anyone, except Shree Parvati. Only She can manage Him. He is fierce and\xc2\xa0 difficult, and to desire for such person is mistake. When you cannot handle such an exacting and strict person, then why do you desire for someone like him\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe last question is \xe2\x80\x93 During the menstrual period can women perform pujas, and can they give realisation and vibrations.\n\nShree Mataji:\xc2\xa0 In Sahaja Yoga, the natural process of menstruation is not considered \xe2\x80\x9dNishidh\xe2\x80\x9d (prohibited).\xc2\xa0 In Sahaja Yoga nothing is considered \xe2\x80\x9dNishidh\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Only, during those days ladies should rest.\xc2\xa0 And regarding Pujas, you know what are My thoughts in that matter.\xc2\xa0 First of all, Whom are you worshipping in the Puja. There also there is a lot of tamasha (outward show). For this also you will have to go very deep to get the right knowledge.\n\nI feel that for the time being dont worry about pujas.\xc2\xa0 Do more of Dhyan (meditation).\xc2\xa0 For whatever fruits you did puja all this time, you have received the fruits and got your realisation.\xc2\xa0 So now no need for pujas. Do meditation.\xc2\xa0 You do not seem to know that you are realised, and there is no more need for pujas.\xc2\xa0 Do more meditation.\xc2\xa0 It is like sitting in a car, going for a program.\xc2\xa0 And even after reaching the program you still want the car to keep moving instead of getting down and doing the program.\n\nSo till you settled down in your realisation, there was need for pujas.\xc2\xa0 We should try to understand how we made this journey and how we reached.\xc2\xa0 The whole situation changes.\xc2\xa0 Like you had to get down from your car and walk to get to this program place. The whole scene changed.\xc2\xa0 To get down you had to stop your car from moving.\xc2\xa0 The situation changed.\xc2\xa0 Now, same way in Sahaja Yoga we have to chane our style and situation.\n\nQuestion from a young girl:\xc2\xa0 Shree Mataji, I am having white patches on my body, and no treatment is helping to cure me.\n\nShree Mataji:\xc2\xa0 Leucoderma comes from bad liver.\xc2\xa0 If it is triggered by some negativity or possession, the disease spreads very fast.\xc2\xa0 That is why such a person should first get rid of the bhoot and badha (possession and negativity).\xc2\xa0 And should never use groundnut (peanut) oil.\xc2\xa0 This Postman brand of peanut oil is very, very bad\xc2\xa0 Hope the makers of this oil dont get after My life.\xc2\xa0 But all kinds of peanut oil is harmful, like Dalda, etc..\xc2\xa0 And those who eat too much of peanuts also get this disease.\xc2\xa0 For this reason you must completely give up eating peanuts.\xc2\xa0 In My whole life I must have only eaten three or four peanuts.\xc2\xa0 Dont eat too much of peanuts.\xc2\xa0 Those who have this problem, after you get your realisation bring some oil and I will vibrate it.\xc2\xa0 You can rub it on the areas in a circular motion.\xc2\xa0 And also cure your liver.\xc2\xa0 At least it will not spread further.\xc2\xa0 It might even reduce.\n\nLast Question:\xc2\xa0 What is the cause of Insomnia, and how can it be eradicated.\xc2\xa0 Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu, Nidra Rupen Samstitha.\n\nShree Mataji: \xc2\xa0The question is about Insomnia, and what are the deities involved.\xc2\xa0 Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu, Nidra Rupen Samstitha.\xc2\xa0 She is the One Who gives you sleep.\xc2\xa0 Is the left side.\xc2\xa0 Mahakali is the One Who gives you sleep.\xc2\xa0 To get to Her you must raise the Mahakali Tattwa.\xc2\xa0 So all those who have this insomnia business, should raise the left side and put it to the right.\xc2\xa0 Try about 108 times first of all.\xc2\xa0 Then you have to do some deep breathing.\xc2\xa0 With deep breathing you go to the left side more.\xc2\xa0 With deep breathing you relax.\xc2\xa0 Then put your attention to the Sahastrara, and sleep off.\xc2\xa0 But insomnia is absolutely curable in Sahaja yoga, if you know how to put left to the right.\xc2\xa0 After that you should also clear out your Agya Chakra.\xc2\xa0 With your Agya finger, turn the chakra\xc2\xa0 round and round; or ask any yogi to put his finger on your Agya.\xc2\xa0 But it might happen that he will get your insomnia!\xc2\xa0 So the best thing is you use My Photograph and try to turn your Agya Chakra like this.\xc2\xa0 Also you can put vibrated kumkum, which will make you sleepy.\xc2\xa0 And try to sleep in complete darkness, without any streak of light coming into the room.\xc2\xa0 Because as long as Surya is , your Agya takes over, and when the surya is there the light makes you feel very active, over active sometimes, and you cannot sleep.\xc2\xa0 And this insomnia is absolutely curable, and you dont take any medicines or anything for them.\n\nAnother thing, taking tea like this in the night, you might get insomnia. Not Me. But you might get. But normally never take any tea or coffee after 6 o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xc2\xa0 Never! Make it a point.\xc2\xa0 I also try to do that because, just to give you a lesson, but I have no problem of sleeping.\xc2\xa0 But you should not take any tea or coffee after 6 o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xc2\xa0 Say about 5 o\xe2\x80\x99clock, afterwards you should not take. You will see that you will sleep very well.\n\nOn the contrary, in the West, people always take coffee after dinner.\xc2\xa0 And then they take pill to sleep.\xc2\xa0 You must take milk.\xc2\xa0 And milk covered with a little butter and sleep with that hot milk, is a very good way of sleeping. If you do not get sleep milk is better.\xc2\xa0 But instead of that you take coffee, means you cannot sleep.\xc2\xa0 And then take a pill. What is the discretion in this.\n\nIs there any other Question please.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else to ask.\xc2\xa0 What are they saying?\n\nAbout Asthma\n\nShree Mataji: Asthma comes from the Right Heart problem, and is curable.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely curable.\xc2\xa0 For Asthma you have to do the mantra of Shri Rama and Sita. It comes from the father\xe2\x80\x99s thing, like maybe your father is dead, you are attached to father, he died suddenly; or you had no father in childhood.\xc2\xa0 Maybe your relationship with father is strained; maybe that you cant see your father.\xc2\xa0 Anything like that can be there.\xc2\xa0 And also it can come from bad relationship with husband also.\xc2\xa0 Asthma can come, or the husband, if he is not a good husband to his wife, he can get asthma very much.\xc2\xa0 If he lost his father early, and he doesnt keep good relationship with the wife, he\xe2\x80\x99ll get always asthma.\xc2\xa0 So that can also happen.\n\nYou can tell him, that Sardarji.\xc2\xa0 You can sit there.\xc2\xa0 You can tell all your problems to him.\xc2\xa0 You can tell him if there is a problem.\n\nQuestion:\xc2\xa0 What is Sachh Khand, or Dassam Dwar.\xc2\xa0 What is this.\n\nShree Mataji \xe2\x80\x93 Sachh Khand is the Limbic Area in the brain.\xc2\xa0 Where the Satya (truth) is established. Where Sathya Prakash (Light of truth) manifests, prakatit means happens.\xc2\xa0 Prakatit Hona \xe2\x80\x93 this word means where it manifests in your awareness.\xc2\xa0 Not that someone lets off a lecture and says this is the truth, that is the truth. But within the brain, the inside area which is called Sahastrara, that is Sachh Khand.\xc2\xa0 It is fully open, and all around it there are 1000 Nadis.\xc2\xa0 And at the time when Kundalini awakens and reaches that khand (limbic area) then you begin to know the truth.\xc2\xa0 Sat-Ya, the truth is always felt on your awareness.\xc2\xa0 Chetana is the light of your brain, and when chetana is enlightened then only you come to know the Satya, the truth.\xc2\xa0 This Viraat that is here, this Viraat is spread all around, is the Paramatma.\xc2\xa0 When that Paramatma is awakened you get the knowledge of Satya inside yourself.\xc2\xa0 For example, when your Kundalini is awakened and comes out of the fontanelle bone area, and you become a Sahaja Yogi, it is not due to the accumulated knowledge that you have, but the truth starts manifesting itself.\xc2\xa0 Then what happens \xe2\x80\x93 supposing you want to know the truth about something.\xc2\xa0 For example if someone says that whatever Nanak Sahib says is not the truth; someone said such a horrible thing; then you can say \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9dAsk the vibrations. You ask \xe2\x80\x93 Was Nanak Sahib the truth itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 As soon as you put out your hands and ask, Was Nanak Sahib an incarnation, the vibrations will be felt pulsating intensely. \xe2\x80\x9dWas Nanak Sahib Paramatma\xe2\x80\x9d, again strong flow of vibrations.\xc2\xa0 Then you will believe that he was God.\xc2\xa0 Then it is not just a collection of knowledge.\xc2\xa0 When the Sahastrara opens, then it is not an accumulation of verbal or mental knowledge; but the reaction of your Spirit to the truth; in the form of vibrations.\xc2\xa0 You will start seeing that the truth manifests in your hands as vibrations.\xc2\xa0 You can know whether this or that is right.\n\nLike as if your brain is a computer, and when it is connected to the mains, then we start realising the Self.\xc2\xa0 The Self within you, connects to the all pervading Divine Power, and you get your knowledge from there.\xc2\xa0 Then you know what is the truth, and what is wrong.\xc2\xa0 So the Sachh Khand is the Shakti of Mahalakshmi, by which a human being becomes the Truth.\n\nIn addition there are two more Shaktis of our Spirit, which manifests within us, which is called Chitth Shakti.\xc2\xa0 By this the entire area of our awareness gets enlightened, the awareness.\xc2\xa0 With that attention, if we just sit in meditation, without doing anything, not asking any questions (if you ask with your Vishuddhi you will get to know the truth); but you just sit with your hands like this and just put your attention on anyone, immediately you will know on your hands what is his condition.\xc2\xa0 This is getting the knowledge of the truth.\n\nSecondly, if someone is sitting next to you, and suddenly you feel that a lot of heat is coming out of this person, a lot of heat; so you even start feeling the Collective situation around you.\xc2\xa0 Your whole attention has spread into Collective Consciousness, and become enlightened; and the effect on your heart is a feeling of joy.\n\nThese three experiences come into your awareness, and this happens when the Kundalini comes into the Sachh Khand, and this is called Dasham Dwar, Brahmand.\xc2\xa0 As soon as your Kundalini breaks through this Sahastrara, this subtle energy, the Ruh, which is the Primordial Spirit of God Almighty, starts being felt on your hands.\xc2\xa0 Then you know this is the vibration of the Holy Spirit.\xc2\xa0 Is that alright?\xc2\xa0 But this is not the knowledge from books or mental knowledge.\xc2\xa0 It is the actualisation of the Kundalini rising.\xc2\xa0 It is a spiritual happening.\n\nKahey Nanak Bin Aapa Chinhey, Mitey Na Bhram ki Kayi \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0 Nanak says - Without first knowing your Self, you cannot get rid of the scum of confusion which covers your awareness and prevents you from knowing your spirit.\n\nJust by singing bhajans, just by talking about it, by giving lectures, nothing is going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The kundalini has to be awakened.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so?\xc2\xa0 The reality, is what you have to achieve.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9dYes My child\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Schizophrenic?\xc2\xa0 Schizophrenia comes from the attack by negative forces.\xc2\xa0 Like if someone has done black magic on you; or you have bowed your head before a false guru; in front of wrong things.\xc2\xa0 This Mattha (forehead) is a very important area.\xc2\xa0 It is the place of Ekadesha Rudra.\xc2\xa0 Here there are the energy of eleven Rudras, here on the forehead.\xc2\xa0 This should not be bowed in front of anyone.\xc2\xa0 Forehead should only be lowered in front of such a person who is authorised to receive such bowing and obeisance.\xc2\xa0 Should not bow before any useless person.\xc2\xa0 There is no need to even bow before Me, until such time that you have become realised.\xc2\xa0 Why do you want to bow at My Feet.\xc2\xa0 What have I given you.\xc2\xa0 I tell you hundred times do not touch My Feet.\xc2\xa0 Instead I get troubled and physical discomfort, if wrong people come and touch My Feet.\n\nSo you must only bow your heads before an authorised guru.\xc2\xa0 But now there are so many false gurus. It is alright if you go to the Gurudwara and bow before the Granth Sahib (Holy Book). Because Granth Sahib is the truth.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise if we keep touching the feet of this one and that one, it is not right or good.\xc2\xa0 For this you can even get a catch when you go to the Gurudwara, because you did a wrong thing.\xc2\xa0 When there is already the Granth Sahib, there is no other guru worthy of bowing to.\xc2\xa0 Accepting any and every person as a guru is wrong.\xc2\xa0 So only bow to the Granth Sahib.\xc2\xa0 There is no other guru beside that.\n\nWhat is Mattha.\xc2\xa0 Bowing your head before anyone means surrendering.\xc2\xa0 There is no meaning in continuously doing akhanda paath, (continuous, unbroken singing of the Book).\xc2\xa0 He has said Ida, Pingala, Sushumna Nadi.\xc2\xa0 From within that Nadi the Kundalini awakens and comes out of the Fontanelle (Shoonya Shikhar).\xc2\xa0 Until and unless it breaks through this fontanelle bone area, nothing happens, nothing is achieved.\xc2\xa0 So till then, one has to be in a surrendered state.\xc2\xa0 This is what bowing the head means.\n\nPeople do other unclean practises which can cause this disease.\xc2\xa0 Or due to extreme weakness.\xc2\xa0 During childhood a sudden shock might create a situation where bhoots and other negative forces gain entry.\xc2\xa0 It can happen from that also.\xc2\xa0 But for this there is no need to go to any negative people like tantriks and mantriks, who are all dirty people.\xc2\xa0 And if anyone has taken money to get rid of possessions, you must never go near them; because theyu take out one spirit and put another into your being.\xc2\xa0 Any man who is interested in your money, you should never go near such a person.\n\nQuestion:\xc2\xa0 Which Prabhu (god) should we worship?\n\nShree Mataji: Once you come into Sahaja Yoga you will discover that you are your own guru.\xc2\xa0 And when you say \xe2\x80\x9dPrabhu\xe2\x80\x9d all the deities come within that.\xc2\xa0 Call it by any name, it is the same thing.\xc2\xa0 You may call it Sasarir Kaal, that also is the same thing. You can call it by any name.\xc2\xa0 But first of all, understand the magnitude, the greatness.\xc2\xa0 Understand fully, what is the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9dPrabhu\xe2\x80\x9d and then you can call it by name.\xc2\xa0 But first of all make the preparations to receive it.\xc2\xa0 Get the knowledge of this great being; then you will know the aspect of this God Almighty you have to recognise and worship.\n\nSupposing your chakra of Shri Rama is catching and is disturbed; and you are calling the name of Nanaka.\xc2\xa0 You are unnecessarily troubling Nanaka when the chakra of Shri Rama is in trouble.\xc2\xa0 And if your chakra of Nanaka is catching, why are you troubling Shri Rama.\xc2\xa0 This is what you have to understand first.\xc2\xa0 Without the rising of Kundalini, you cannot know at which point a chakra is catching.\n\nUntil you start your vehicle, you cannot know where the turn is, where you must steer your car.\xc2\xa0 If you turn your car to the left or right, before it even starts, how will you know where the problem is.\xc2\xa0 As and when you reach the turns or the obstacles, then only you can steer your car accordingly.\xc2\xa0 First of all understand what is the movement of your kundalini, and where it has been obstructed.\xc2\xa0 Everything depends on you.\xc2\xa0 You have to understand your instrument.\xc2\xa0 Then only you will know at what chakra your kundalini has stopped, and what mantra has to be said to remove the problem.\xc2\xa0 You say the mantra and the correct deity awakens and cures; and your kundalini continues on Her journey.\xc2\xa0 Then the next deity awakens, and you go further.\xc2\xa0 In this journey you have to keep your attention alert, so that you know where your Kundalini is at any given point.\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga the complete knowledge of this Mantra Vidya is explained, and you become fully capable.\xc2\xa0 You can experiment and have person experiences.\xc2\xa0 There is no blind faith involved.\xc2\xa0 You can know yourself where your Kundalini is at any time.\xc2\xa0 When these western Sahaja Yogis have the knowledge of Who Nanaka Sahib is, and Who is Shri Ganesha, then why cant you master this knowledge.\xc2\xa0 You already know these things.\xc2\xa0 You should not have a closed mind.\xc2\xa0 Only then will you know all about your Kundalini.\xc2\xa0 And it should not worry you that this prophet did not mention this, or that saint did not talk about it.\xc2\xa0 No problem.\xc2\xa0 Because they did not have sufficient time.\xc2\xa0 They were being tortured by human beings, and they would not let them speak openly.\xc2\xa0 Whatever time they had, they tried to give the maximum knowledge that they could manage.\xc2\xa0 Whatever Shri Rama had come to do, He did.Now My job is to raise the Kundalini, and that is what I am doing.\xc2\xa0 Whatever job each one came for, he did that only.\xc2\xa0 Whatever he had to do is done, so now dont hold on to him and ask why he did not mention these things, and therefore I am not going to believe it.\n\nEvery one spoke about the future.\xc2\xa0 Just understand this.\xc2\xa0 They all talked about what was going to come in the future.\xc2\xa0 No one claimed that that was the time.\xc2\xa0 They all said that the right time would come in the future.\xc2\xa0 Even Mohammed Sahib said that Resurrection Time will come in the future.\xc2\xa0 They said it many times.\n\nAnd Now the time has really come, and you are hesitating, because in the past no one talked about Kundalini awakening.\xc2\xa0 But didn\xe2\x80\x99t they all promise that the time for resurrection is going to come when you will get all the knowledge.\xc2\xa0 Everyone said.\xc2\xa0 And yet when that time has come, you are not ready to believe it. Because Nanak Sahib did not say.\xc2\xa0 But then they had to leave something for Me to say also!\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 Or did they finish saying everything.\xc2\xa0 Did you even let them say all that they wanted.\xc2\xa0 You are not allowing Me to say anything; what would you have allowed them to say.\xc2\xa0 Instead you all took their lives.\xc2\xa0 You got after their lives.\xc2\xa0 As long as they were alive, how many followed their teachings.\xc2\xa0 Even their wives got after their life.\xc2\xa0 And now, when they are not there, you say what you like about them.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to help in any way.\n\nWe must see what is for our good, for Swaarth, means knowledge of the Self.\xc2\xa0 Very nice word, this \xe2\x80\x9dSwaarth \xe2\x80\x9d!\xc2\xa0 Swa means Self; and Arth means Knowledge.\xc2\xa0 Even Shivaji Maharaj said a time will come when we will seek the meaning of Swaarth.\xc2\xa0 Gyaneshwarji has mentioned in his Pasayadan that a day will come like this, when you will get the knowledge of your Tantra (instrument).\xc2\xa0 You will know the knowledge of Swa, and you will know what is the union with Brahma.\xc2\xa0 You will know the meaning of the union of Nirakar with Aakar (form merging into formless).\n\nThey have all said this and gone.\xc2\xa0 But we are not doing anything to prepare for that happening.\xc2\xa0 We have just caught hold of what one person said; or the other person said; and are sitting, still holding on.\xc2\xa0 Did this do any good for our forefathers, or for you.\xc2\xa0 Alright!\xc2\xa0 If something is still incomplete, it is going to be completed now.\n\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything less.\xc2\xa0 They did a lot.\xc2\xa0 But there was a limit to what they had come to do.\xc2\xa0 Then there comes the final stage, when everything is assembled together.\xc2\xa0 Like when you make puris in your house.\xc2\xa0 First of all you knead the flour, then you roll it into roundels, then you deep fry it, and then you eat it.\xc2\xa0 When you eat and enjoy it, that is the completion of the project.\xc2\xa0 Before that the preparations were being made.\xc2\xa0 Now you might say puri-making is only kneading of the flour; or puri making means the frying of it; but you are never ready to eat it.\xc2\xa0 You are still stuck with kneading of the flour.\xc2\xa0 You must now get ready to taste it and eat it.\xc2\xa0 The puris are ready, so why not eat and enjoy.\xc2\xa0 When it is placed before you, why dont you eat it.\xc2\xa0 Do you understand.\xc2\xa0 This is the mistake human beings make, and because of this you will be left behind.\xc2\xa0 Left very far behind.\xc2\xa0 We must understand that the time for enjoying the puris has come.\xc2\xa0 The Mother has made the puris, so come and eat it.\xc2\xa0 Straightforward!\n\nYes, My child.\n\nQuestion:\xc2\xa0 How can one experience Chinmay Roop?\n\nShree Mataji: Put these ideas aside.\xc2\xa0 First of all you must know the all pervading Brahma Shakti.\xc2\xa0 Receive that Shakti into yourself.\xc2\xa0 Now what idea you have of Chinmay Roop, and what you understand it to be, this is all accumulated knowledge from books or hearsay.\xc2\xa0 Whatever you have read, or whatever anyone has said, should not have any connection with you.\xc2\xa0 You have not seen it, right?\xc2\xa0 First you must get to know the all pervading Divine Energy which is spread all over.\xc2\xa0 Once you get into contact with it, you will start understanding everything.\xc2\xa0 First get it.\xc2\xa0 Allow that subtle experience to happen to you.\xc2\xa0 Allow it to happen inside you.\xc2\xa0 And this cannot happen without Kundalini awakening.\xc2\xa0 Everyone has said this before they went.\xc2\xa0 First let this all pervading energy awaken within you, and then slowly, very slowly, you will get to know everything.\n\nIt is like when you enter a room, and a light is put on, slowly slowly you start seeing all the objects inside.\xc2\xa0 But first you have to enter the room.\xc2\xa0 Why do you want to know what happens later.\xc2\xa0 Why should I tell you that just now.\xc2\xa0 Alright?\n\nFirst you have to enter the door.\xc2\xa0 The best thing is to first come inside and take your realisation.\xc2\xa0 You dont become an Avadhut (divine body) immediately.\xc2\xa0 Because even to transform into an Avadhut you need to have the Divine Energy, the Shakti, awakened in you.\xc2\xa0 Slowly and gradually\xc2\xa0 you have to transform into a divine personality who can bear the Divine Energy within himself.\xc2\xa0 Then you will be able to support the energy of God inside you.\xc2\xa0 Then you will gradually know the truth.\n\nI have not told you the whole truth for fear of your reaction.\xc2\xa0 If I tell you, you will start jumping.\xc2\xa0 That is why you must advance slowly.\n\nEnglish:\n\nQuestion:\xc2\xa0 Is there any cure in Sahaja Yoga for Aortic Stenosis? Incompetence of the wall of the heart\n\nShree Mataji: Who is the person who has incompetence of the wall of the heart.\xc2\xa0 Are you vegetarian.\xc2\xa0 Are you a vegetarian.\n\nYes, Mother\n\nShree Mataji:\xc2\xa0 Automatically it will come with vegetarianism.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 It is lethargic heart.\xc2\xa0 So we will tell you what is to be done.\xc2\xa0 How to cure it.\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely curable.\xc2\xa0 But you will have to eat proteins.\xc2\xa0 If you do not want to take non-vegetarian, you will have to eat proteins and give up carbohydrates.\xc2\xa0 Then only it will work out.\xc2\xa0 But you will have to be careful to eat more proteins.\xc2\xa0 The rest of it we will see.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________-\n\nThe following part is not on the video and the video looks to be incomplete:\n\nBack to English at the end at 1 :52\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion : \xe2\x80\xa6and here is the daughter, who\xe2\x80\x99s having hearing problem.\nShri Mataji: Hearing problem can be cured, very easy it is, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them how to do it, but they have to go to the centre. All these people have to go to the centre, settle down in Sahaja Yoga, become Sahaja Yogis, and every problem can be solved. I can tell you, you need a good health, now the Bran who was speaking here, he used to have crashes [?]. He could not walk one step. Can you believe he\xe2\x80\x99s climbing and talking. So all the problems are cured, all the emotional problems are settled, everything just promised, but first you get your Yoga, you must get your Yoga, then every thing can be done.\nThis is the first condition of Sahaja Yoga, for which you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay, for which you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything, stand on your head or anything \xe2\x80\x93 nothing of the kind- but give some time to yourself, take to Yoga, go to your centres every week, which we have in every house\xe2\x80\xa6Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nH.H.
