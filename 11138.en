... I have told you about all of them in great detail. And many of you are well aware of the all-pervading Power that has been talked about in every religion at all times. Even then, when I say that you live as householders and that you should not go towards Hatha Yoga, many people get upset with Me. And when I say that you people should not ruin yourself by following these sanyasis and householders should keep them away - even then you people think that “Mother, why are You forbidding everything?” I want to tell you all the religions in their entirety. Not only this, whatever is incomplete in them, I want to complete it. I cannot be against any shastra [rules set in sacred texts] or religion. But I am definitely against false shastras and false religions. And where something is against true religion and true shastras, as a mother I have to tell you clearly.

Later you will also experience that whatever I say is absolutely true, practical. When you try these vibrations flowing from your hands on others, you will understand that whatever I say is absolutely true. And I say it completely for your benefit and for the systematic illumination of the path of your ascent. This is a very sad situation that man takes a lot of time to accept the truth. If someone spreads a falsehood, then man believes it very quickly. Or if something is spread which strengthens his weaknesses or confirms his ego, then man assimilates it very quickly.

But today I will tell you a little about Hatha Yoga and sankhya (analysis). Because Shankaracharya has also clearly said that “na yoge na sankhye” (neither by yoga nor analysis). You will not get Self-Realisation through yoga and sankhya. Therefore, I am not saying this for the first time. People have said this many times; and whatever holy men you look at, no one had taken sanyas, except the Nath sect. And their path was also very difficult. You know that Janak was a king. And he lived like a king, but people call him Videhi. That is why Janakiji is called Vaidehi. You know that Nanak was also married, and Krishna also got married. Ram also got married and there were people like you who loved their family in the world. No one took sanyasa etc., nor did these people give so much recognition to yoga. Only Patanjali paid special attention to yoga. But people do not read Patanjali either. We accept the fifth hand, sixth hand information that we get about yoga. And considering it to be special, we start doing yoga, which is called Hatha Yoga.

For the normal people who live in the family, Hatha Yoga is extremely harmful. Now why does it happen? How does it happen? I will explain this to you. You people sit with an open mind. If you sit with an open mind, you will immediately understand what I am saying. The powers of a human are limited. They are limited within the body. Till he does not get Self-Realisation, till he does not connect with that all-pervading Power, till then his power is limited. Like a battery cell. Till the time something keeps running on the battery cell, till then its power will remain limited. But if it is connected to electrical mains, then the power will keep coming all the time. That is why I explain in completely modern terms, so that we can see it in our daily life. Now when you do Hatha yoga, there is a description of two nadis, Ha and Tha. Which are called Surya Nadi and Chandra Nadi. Which we call sympathetic nervous system. When you start using these two nadis (channels), which are called Ida and Pingala Nadi - in the use of these two nadis, we use the limited energy that we have, which is very limited.

When we say that we do physical exercise etc., then it should be understood that we are not doing Hatha yoga at all. We are just doing “Ha” yoga. Hatha Yoga means that its six things have to be completed. You already know Yama, Niyama etc. Till the time you are not completing them, you are doing only partial yoga and that too you are only doing the work of your “Ha” Nadi i.e. Surya Nadi. Your body can grow with Surya Nadi and your mental capacity may increase. But we are at least three things. Firstly we are mental, emotional, and physical. So if we concentrate our limited energy on these two things, especially on the body, then our emotional nadi, which is called Chandra Nadi, becomes completely dry. It keeps getting drained. Everything keeps getting drawn from there and comes to our body. And when we use it to expand our body, then our emotional being becomes completely dry.

That is why you must have seen that most of the yogis are of a very heartless nature. It is as if they do not have a heart. And they are so angry and egoistic that if you read their lives with understanding, then sometimes you feel that they are some kind of egoistic monsters. Like if you read Vishwamitra, how he got after the life of poor Harishchandra? He himself was a sanyasi but still got after his life. He [Harishchandra] was a good householder, with wife and children, ruled his kingdom in dharma. He took his life and ruined his condition. You have heard of Durvasa. If you take his name in the morning, you will not get food for three days. The third was Jamdagni sahab, what to say about him.

It is so much so, that it is said about Parashar Muni that he too had done a very dirty thing in his life, with Satyavati. Those who had made their hearts completely empty but could not control their sexual desires. All their penance etc. was destroyed in a moment. And today there are many such people, you know. There have been many such sages and munis here. There was Parshuram, who drank the whole ocean in anger. He had reduced someone to ashes. He had destroyed someone. Till date you would not have heard from anyone that any of them has saved or done good to anyone. It means that if you draw all that power from the limited powers that you have within you on just one channel, if you increase your physical being or your mental being, then your emotional being will be completely empty. And you cannot say anything about such a person, no matter how much he reaches. Because his ego will become stronger.

Leave Hatha Yoga, this is a similar method of doing karate by Japanese people, by which they say that we can defend ourselves. We learn things for our protection. And if we attack someone at one point, we can kill him instantly. They say that we are doing it for defence. But they become so egoistic, so cruel, that they often use it to kill people, and you know that among Japanese people, some people have become very cruel because of this karate. Your emotional being, your mind, your left nadi, all of that drains out and all the Hatha Yogis will not die of cancer. Their body will look very radiant because they are walking on the Surya Nadi. Their face will look very good.

You will also see that women will be very conscious about their body and figure. And in the house where such women are there, it will be difficult for the husband to live. It will be difficult for the children to live; they will eat everyone’s life. In trying to make them perfect, the husband will say, God save me, from where did this sanyasini enter my house. This woman has taken my life. “Why did you keep this here? Why did you keep that there?” She will keep eating the husband in every way. And in that eating she will think that she is doing a very religious act. She will never feel that by doing all this I am hurting everyone. I am taking the life of my children. I am troubling them too.

There are many such men in the family, that they worship Hanumanji, but they themselves have become the grandfather of Hanumanji. If someone dares to keep water from here to there in the house, he will start shouting. There was such a good man in our family too, he is still alive. He had made everyone run around in the house. But it was I who exposed his true nature. Everyone else was afraid of him. He was so dry, so unaware of the thoughts of others, others’ pain, and others’ sufferings. He was so closed, insensitive, that he had absolutely no sensitivity. And don’t even talk about compassion and love. He cannot understand that.

Most people who practice yoga, women, men, never get along with them at home. If both of them do it, then God save them. That house will be completely ruined. But even if one does it is enough. The wife starts dreaming of becoming a film actress and the man roams around like a Sando [a famed wrestler]. What do we have to do by becoming Sandos? Do we have to fight wrestling? What do you have to do by doing so much yoga? One must live the balanced life that is required to live a normal life. Yes, it is okay that you have done some exercise, that is fine. But why is there a need to increase one thing so much that your heart chakra becomes completely minus. It becomes so minus that if you see such a person from a distance, you start feeling dizzy.

One day I was in Lucknow. Our relative, who used to show off a lot in our house, had a habit of going for a walk in the morning. So one day I saw that when I was also going for a walk in that direction, some people were running helter-skelter. I could not understand whether they were running away seeing Me or seeing him. What happened? After that, all those people came to meet Me. They started saying, “Sister-in-law, forgive us, we were rude and ran away but where were You going with this ferocious animal? Where were You going with this lion?” They started running in the opposite direction. God save us, he will beat us with a stick. If you go to talk to them, they will run to eat you. They do not know how to laugh. They do not know that there is laughter or smile or something like that in the world. They are very serious. And they do not understand anyone’s sorrow or anyone’s pain. If you tell them, “This man is in a lot of pain. He is in so much pain.” They will say, “See how I controlled my pain, you should also do it.” He is not a yogi. You have controlled your pain. But they do not know that their death will always be of a heart attack.

A Sahaja yogi has a balance of both. I will tell the reason for that later. But all the yogis, they will die just like that, and no one will know about them, they will disappear. After that, when they die, it will be difficult to find even four people [to carry the body for the funeral]. I tell you, when these yogis die, it is difficult to find four people. The fifth person who will pick up the pot is not going to be found. Because children already run away, and people of the whole world run away from such people. Now people say through yoga that we can cure your disease; may God protect you. Instead of curing your disease with these, you will get such diseases that tomorrow your wife will ask you to divorce her. “God save me, I cannot stand any harm against you. I cannot live with you. May God save you from this yoga vidya which you have started.” Therefore, one should think a thousand times that yoga is very dangerous for the people living in a family.

But why was yoga created? In which system was Patanjali created? It was thousands of years ago when Patanjali brought out Patanjali Yoga. This is the yoga of that time, that society does not exist today. First of all, in those days we had the institution of four varnas (stages of life by age). You know that earlier, after the age of five, children used to go to the jungles and study with a realized soul, a guru. Not this Tom, Dick and Harry, a realized soul, the definition of that is Guru. Not only that, he was a realized soul, but he also knew the entire shastra (science) of realisation. That is why he lived in the jungle, and a university was run in his name. What we call gotra, these are the same universities. And intra-gotra marriage was prohibited because the children living in a university lived like s and sisters. Well, apart from that, at that age your health improves. Your growth increases. That is why it is necessary for you to give your body as much energy as it needs to nourish it.

Secondly, the matter of your heart, the matter of love, firstly the guru used to take care of it. The guru used to keep it filled with his love. Secondly, the grandparents in Vanaprasthashram [where householders went to live in the forest after completing family responsibilities] also used to live in the forest. They loved their (grand)children and had no involvement in household affairs. The love they gave to their children was a source of their second power. After marriage, just think how much you are already drained. It means that in today’s society, such a person is so troubled. He does not have time to show some love or talk to someone with love for two minutes. And if someone becomes a yogi, then just think, there are thousands of fights between husband and wife; then you have completely ruined the family life. Sahaja Yoga cannot be done without family life. This is also a special thing. Generally, Sahaja Yoga is done only with family people.

That is why it is right to tell those who take sanyas that you take sanyas and sit in the jungles. Stay in the jungle. You will run away from there after two days, in disguise. Just yesterday I met a gentleman. He told Me that, I have collected statistics. I went there to Haridwar. I went to Haridwar. I went to Haridwar, I went there, and I met many sanyasis there. So I was surprised that, I say 99.9% and 1% because I did not find such a person. But I say that there will be some chance. All the people who had come there were telling that “Sir, my wife died so I came. My father died so I came. So and so happened so I came. My income tax people were after me, so I came. I was caught smuggling, so I came.” That means many people came to escape from jail. And they have also come there to escape their family life. The other style of people was that “Sir I have come here. I thought that there will be some arrangement of food and drink here.” So here I see that even saffron colour for saffron clothes is not available here. It is a very difficult task. And the situation here is very bad.

Nowadays the world has become so bad that no one gives alms to the sanyasis. All the beggars from all over the world thought that this is easy, beg for some money and wear saffron clothes. And they all go and live in the Himalayas. When I was in Delhi recently, I received letters from at least five or six ashrams saying that “Mataji, you are the nurturer of the whole world, you are Shakti incarnate. You are for us beggars.” This was not written, but I say between the lines that, “for us sadhus, please send blankets and dhotis and this and that from there.” That means it was not written beggar; they had described themselves as sadhus. Sadhu means one who attains [the Spirit]. You understood, right? One who attains is a sadhu. So in this way I have their letters. You tell me, these people are like parasites on your society. They are after your wealth, that means you earn, you work hard, you do everything and who will eat? So this sadhu baba. Tell me, he does not work hard at all. He does nothing. He is becoming fat. And you are becoming thin.

Such sadhus babas roam from village to village, street to street. And in our city too, there are many such people who call themselves sanyasis. I have written a small, I should say a simple poem that came out of My Mouth, “Tu le sanyaas, paisa mere paas” (you can renounce, I have the money). Here you will find such sadhus that you will have to do namaskar to them and ultimately have to take sanyas. Because they will either get rid of you from people or get rid of you will want to be rid of them. The seriousness that they show in these people, the hypocrisy that they bring about, this should be understood. Now many ladies here, especially at your place, should understand this. Because ladies, especially Sitaji also made a big mistake once. You people are making such a mistake every day that if any sadhu baba comes, you should go to his feet. Then he may have just come after getting released from jail, after changing his clothes. Even if he has come to hide in your house after cheating someone. No matter what business he does, he will come back.

Women will say, “Ah! Babaji had come.” “Which Babaji?” “I don’t know.” “He was very big, very brilliant. I gave him shelter.” “Oh, fool, who was he! He was a servant in the neighbour’s house. He ran away from there after stealing. He is fooling you. He has come with a beard. You touch his feet.” “No, no, I felt very happy!” “What did I feel happy?” Later, said, “Ah aha...! What a pleasure. Sadhu baba, come to the house.” Sadhu baba has come and is living comfortably in the house. Lady, mother, and father used to wash his feet daily and drink the water. While doing this, they saw that the wealth of the house was disappearing. They started saying, take a loan from somewhere. He has to do something. After that, sadhu baba said, “Now you will not have a place to live.” I don’t know much Sanskrit. “A-sthan (place), our asthan will move from here.” If their asthan is shaken, your safe will also be shaken with it. If this does not happen, then they have not done any work on you. If they are not genuine, then they will do business like this only.

Thousands of such unlucky people come to Me in London. They come to Delhi and say, “Mataji, get rid of him. He has started following us. He has started following us. What should we do with him?” But even now, those who are stuck in this affair, if you ask them, “Why are you dying for this sadhu baba?,” they feel very bad. But when they are completely shunned, then they come to Me and say, “Mataji, he turned his back on us and went away.” This is such a serious matter and yet it makes one laugh at the great stupidity of man. Now I have told you that nature has placed the balance on the Chandra Nadi and Surya Nadi on its own. You don’t need to do it. Why are you after yourself? You should lead a balanced life. Lead a normal life and live a simple life. You don’t need to do any dravidian pranayam [a roundabout way of doing things].

I see that some people get up early in the morning and stand on their heads. There was a gentleman living in opposite us, Mr. Patil. He used to get up at four o’clock and suspend himself. He used to come down from suspending himself at about six o’clock. And in his house, there was a fight with his daughter-in-law, a fight with his son. The whole family was worried that if the old man dies, then the trouble will be over. When that old man died, he did not leave anything for his children, he donated everything to another yogashram, that yoga [laughs]. There also, all the old people who will die will also die like this. And he was also a heart patient. But he would always stand upside down in his shirshasana. Now see this madness that if I am saying against yoga, then people will be enraged – “Why does Mataji say this?” But you think, what is the need to do so much dravidi pranayam?  Okay, your body should work properly, so do a little exercise; done. But why did you need to stand on your head all the time, twenty-four hours a day? The first thing is to learn to love. The family or the world, or the whole family of the world, or should I say more than that, the whole creation, the whole universe, is running on the fire of love. Who has asked you to leave love and make a spectacle? You do not need to do all these things.

Now there are others who are nowadays roaming around London playing music. They have added a new level of glory to our Indian culture. If I tell you their story, you will say, “Why didn’t you slap them, Mother?” Their cabaret dance continues on Bond Street. They only keep their hair shaved. And that is the choti, which is called bodi, and in Marathi it is called “shendi.” They paste it here and do dressing there. Hair dressing, that dressing is sold. Each one costs five hundred rupees. They paste it here and dance there. And while dancing, those poor guys never know how to wear dhoti. Still they wear dhoti, women keep wearing saris. They don’t have to wear saris, and they don’t know how to wear dhoti either. It is our dress, give it to us. If you want to wear it, then wear it properly and walk like us. Firstly, the women there cannot even wear saris. Their gait is like that of a horse. They walk like this. We walk like this; they walk like this.

We had gone to Lucknow. There was a wedding going on. So there I saw that everyone was walking like this. In the middle someone was jumping like a horse. Everyone was wearing a sari. I said who is this, jumping like a horse? Then I went ahead and heard that a daughter-in-law has come from America. I said I understood. And the poor girl was not able to walk in her chappals. She was walking like a horse, sliding. And her hair was also like a horse’s. Those people are not used to this. They walk like horses. They live like horses. Their style is like a horse, what can be done with them? They should know how to walk before wearing a sari. But think of the women there in Bond Street, you think, who have never worn a sari. They wear a sari, and these people wear a dhoti and do cabaret dance there. Out of shame you think that God, what is this? And there people joke in parties that, “Mataji, you are wearing this sari. Mother, you are wearing this thing. And you don’t have any problem?” I said, “What?” He said, “We saw on Bond Street that all the dhoti and saris come loose.” I said, “Bhai, this is our dress from generations. And this is our modesty too.” And you say that they are promoting Indian culture. Then God save us. Tell such people that, “Let us promote our culture, which is in our every vein. Please don’t promote our culture.”

This is the thing about your Hatha Yoga which you call Hatha. Although you don’t follow Hatha, you follow “Ha” only. And when you come to “Th” from Hatha, then God save you. “Ha” means complete abstinence. Don’t eat this, don’t eat that. “I have to do it for twenty-five Mondays. I have to offer these hundred thousand things to Lord Shiva.” Now a lady had come from Allahabad, becoming a mahabrahmini [a brahmin of a high order]. She stayed in the house of a poor Maharashtrian brahmin here. Now she was a relative of a big man, so he let her stay in his house. When she left, after that everyone in his house became fine. After that he came and said that even my great, great grandmother was not like this woman. I said, “What happened?” She said that “As soon as she came, she started scolding her husband. You know that I don’t drink tap water. Why didn’t you fill the well water for me?” The poor husband went to the well with a bucket at night. He went there and brought water.

In the morning she started shouting that “I have to offer a hundred thousand bael leaves to Lord Shiva, they have to be brought.” So he had to get them drenched in water. Now when he went to Malabar Hill drenched in water, poor man - they caught him and beat him. The people there said that who told you to offer so many bael leaves? He kept searching in that drenched state, from there a servant who also went drenched and brought them for him. He [the servant] was scolded four times that you did not see the leaves properly. Firstly, for going and picking them at four o’clock; what would he see? He was scolded so much, so much. But in the evening he got 107 fever. And that poor fellow started saying that “I have become ill. Send me to the hospital.”

After that, another servant came. When she came to know that they have work to do, he was filled with tremors. He said, I had an attack of malaria. They also went away. Then this poor person who was her husband, came after him [the host]. Made him climb the tree too. Made him do all the work too. In the end, he too gave up. For five days. Then they telephoned Me and said, “Mataji, please shift them somewhere else with your influence.” Then she went to Pune. Wherever she went, her antics were famous. There was a lot of publicity about it. And the gentleman with whom she was related said, “Sir, I sent him to save myself.” I said, “We will come and beat you with a stick. Please tell such divine people to sit in the Triveni [river] there, do japa there and remain in silence. They should not embroil others in this trouble.” Have the ladies understood? Have you understood or not?

Well, this is kind of nonsense people do which people do in Hatha Yoga and in this kind of worship. You go to worship. Now this is another way of going to worship, going to temples. I am never against temples, nor am I against any religion. I am in religion. But you cannot go to the temple where Ganeshji is sitting. The bhootnath [bhut/possessed] who is sitting near Ganesh, he instantly puts his spell on your Agnya Chakra, and you get possessed. “I had only gone to the temple.” We recently brought a boy to Delhi for cure. We gave him vibrations. He got cured. After that, I told him, “Look, take off this thread [around wrist given by some false guru or priest] you are wearing.” Then he got cured. “Take off the thread.”

After that, he came the next day. He was the same as before. I said, “I worked so hard for one hour, two hours and then how did you become the same as before. How did you catch the Agnya Chakra?” “We did not go anywhere, Mataji.” So I said, “Where is the tilak on the forehead from?” He said, “I went to Bhairav’s temple. I applied Bhairavnath’s tilak.” I said, “Bhairavnath has no other business? Where did you go to apply it. Where did you get this tilak from?” Then I wiped it out, did everything. Then asked the name of the temple. Then asked the name of the priest. Then shoe beat him. Then he was freed. All the demons in the whole world have taken the contract of all the temples. They will not marry. Why will they? They are celibates, permanent celibates. We have such organisations here as well. They say, “Sir, we are Brahma.” “What does Brahma mean?.” “We don’t marry.” “Okay, we don’t marry.” Men also don’t marry; women also don’t marry. But everything else happens. We don’t marry. It is a very nice place. Come on, the whole thing is collective. We are living very happily.

And especially those people who are into yoga, what happens to them, that they become so stunted, so stunted, that nobody can sit with them. Especially those who recite Savitri Mantra. Savitri Mantra will make you completely stunted. Because in it, the mud that is left after filtering, it is there. Savitri Mantra is that thing. In which you are told that it is like this that this is a lamp. There is flame inside the lamp. Those are just the things about the lamp, there is bhu, bhuvah of a different place, all these things are there. But the thing inside the lamp, the all-pervading Power that enlightens, is not mentioned in it. Only different forms of the lamp have been told.

Now you have started memorizing that. Now those people who do this, they have a big problem that they do not fit in any society. Because wherever he goes, people will create problems for him in the chair on which he sits. If he visits any house, there will be trouble. So while doing this, they think that let’s go and sit in some ashram. Let’s go to Pondicherry. Let’s go there. Now there, everyone is sitting in this stupidity. So these people get along with each other. Because all of them are stupid. So because of this, such organizations are formed. In this, all the stupid people sit and plan how to make others stupid. How to create problems for others. All these arrangements keep happening.

And anger. These people are so angry that you cannot talk to them for even a minute. If you talk to them, they just hit you with a stick. So you thought, oh no...! These people can never do good to anyone. Because a person who does not have love in his heart, who does not have what is called compassion flowing inside him, who does not have any kind of sweetness inside him - how can he do good to anyone? That is why you should not go in such extreme ways. Although it is heard that the government itself is getting it done. So, may God save us. What is there already, then when it is said in Marathi that the king himself started killing, then what to do now? Now if the government itself starts such a yoga, may God save us.

One can do his remedy with ease and simplicity through Sahaja Yoga, but he cannot do it with yoga. It can be done in a moment. Treatment with Sahaja Yoga is done in a moment. The person who gets across, he gets liberated anyway. Because his connection is established. Powers start coming inside him. He is not dependent on his power. The power that is spread all around, starts flowing inside him. So his physical being, his emotional being, his mental being gets completely flooded. And because of this such people become dynamic. And they will keep working hard the whole day. They do not get tired. They are attractive. You feel like sitting with them. If ten such people sit together, then it is fun. Now this is that one or two people out of a hundred are always evil. You cannot say that all of them will be so. One or two people are always evil. No matter how much you try, his dual nature does not go away. His filth does not go away. Even if you try very hard, he remains the same. There is a slight difference. Then it happens again. Then it happens again. It works with difficulty. But there are many first-class people in this.

But if you sit with ten yogis, then you should go out or else you will insure yourself. Because two wrestlers will be able to sit together. But if ten yogis sit together, then it will be shattered. Recently a seminar was held. So I said to one or two people, just so and see it, come and enjoy it. So there was such a fight there, such a fight that those who went to see it came running, saving their heads, saying, “Mataji, what is this maya you have done.” I said, “What maya did I do?” So this is indeed a spectacle. A yogi is fighting with him saying, “I am greater than you.” He started saying, “I am greater than you.” So those officers who were sitting there started saying to me, “Mataji, these people call themselves yogis, and they are fighting more openly than us for the chair.” And abuses and everything. “And you are like this, what do you think of yourself?”

One was saying I am a devotee of Shiva; I am a devotee of Krishna. Shiva and Krishna must be sitting there holding their heads, saying, “Since when did he become my devotee?” This kind of drama was going on in the whole of Delhi. Those newspaper people, press people, they came to Me and said, “Mataji, please stop this. What nonsense is this. Will these foreigners understand this?” And here television is also installed. A yogi had donated 35 lakh rupees for this. But he was in such a mess that he did not come on the third day. All his money was wasted. He spent 35 lakh rupees on this; God knows from where. God cannot be called by such academicians and such artificial people, by artificial means. God is in the heart. One who does not long for God in his heart cannot find God. Those who are making themselves academic, and all this a big thing – they gave a big academic dissertation. Although it seemed as if a bhut was dancing on their head. Only they knew what they were saying. No one else could understand what they were saying.

If such people try to organize you, then you should have full faith in your independence. And you should stand on your independence. One thing you should also know is that these people are doing it only for money. Money is a very dirty thing. If I tell you here today that fifty thousand rupees have been kept in My organization. I tell you that ten times more people than you will come here. But all flies will come. Real people will not come. All flies will come. That is money; the money that has been kept there. We will say in yoga seminars that this will happen to us, this will be important, this will happen. Then people will come to us. We will be considered great. And with all these things, behind these one false thing, these people have made the poor simple householders hollow.

It is forbidden for a married man to go for Hatha Yoga. It is absolutely forbidden. Because the first thing that happens with Hatha Yoga is called impotency. The first thing that will come is impotency. If you look at a Hatha Yogi, he is impotent. This is the first thing. Because when his drainage starts, the first drainage will be on the Mooladhara chakra, and such a man will not be innocent at all. He will be very clever and cunning. To understand Hatha Yoga, to run it and to do it, there should be such arrangements, which were there in the time of Patanjali. Those are not there today. Nowadays, leave alone grandparents, no one even allows their in-laws to stay in the house. And the parents, day, and night, think about the children, how did this trouble come into the house. In such a situation, whatever drain you have, it should be eliminated. All the tensions you have, you will have to remove them and live in a normal way. Just like normal married people live. Live in that way.

Sahaja Yoga will not work if you are extreme. Sahaja Yoga does not work on people who are of extreme temperament. And then people think that Mataji, why did you not help us cross over? What is the matter? Why did we not cross over? Because you are an abnormal person. Abstinence, that will not eat, will not eat that; die of hunger. Those who die of hunger deliberately, many are dying like this poor souls. They will cross over. But those who are dying of hunger deliberately will never cross over. You are insulting the Annapurna residing within you. This does not mean that you become Bakasur [a gluttonous rakshasa], not at all. That is the other side. But on the side of abstinence, I am telling you that extreme abstinence should not be done. Abstinence from only one thing is necessary and it is good if done before Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise I will make you quit it later - that is alcohol. Alcohol and smoking also a little bit because both work on our awareness. They affect our consciousness. That is why you should try to quit these two things. If you quit these then it is fine and if you do not quit then I will make you quit them later in meditation.

Now look at the other side, which you call sankhya. This is the emotional side. That your children have become everything to you. Now if they are dying, you don’t see anything in the world except them. You will kill ten children for that child; but you will save that child. This is sankhya; indulgence. Drinking alcohol, having too much interest in women. Leaving your wife and looking at another woman and such things; all are exactly the same thing. Whether it is a little or a lot. This has become a big disease in today’s society. I had told you about it earlier also that it is a matter of flirting, it is nothing but a badha of the Agnya Chakra, this is a bhut. The man whose eyes keep wandering all the time, there is a bhut in him. And when his eyes fall on a woman, she also gets possessed by a bhut. This is a contagious disease. She also starts this business. She does nothing, just keeps moving her eyes. There is nothing to do or hold on to. The eyes keep moving. But the ghost will catch hold of your Agnya Chakra. That is why it is difficult to free the Agnya Chakra of a person whose attention is like this.

That is why people these days say that they have a lot of headache. They have a lot of complaints about their head. People who work too much and are already involved in work are draining out their energy like this. Apart from that, they do not suffer from any such disease, like yoga or this kind of indulgence. So they will die as they go. You must have heard about many people that he was a so-and-so officer. He just walked two steps and was finished on the third step. If you read his biography, he had all kinds of hobbies. He died such a terrible death because of those hobbies. I mean, everyone dies. But for some it is so auspicious and for some it is so inauspicious. That is why the power which God has given to you should be used with purity.

When you come to indulgences, your sense of purity is lost. Purity does not mean that you run away from something. It does not mean so at all. Purity is a state within you. Like the lotus leaf, which is given as an example, has its own state. Nothing sticks to it. Its mind is such that nothing sticks to it. Until such a state is reached, the deities sitting within you cannot be fully awakened. This is the state of dharma in which purity is has a very big part. And its gana is Ganesha. And without the help of Ganesha, no work can be done; and the specialty of Ganesha is that he is innocent, he is a child. A child who is completely attached to his mother can be of very good character. He can also be of very good character. And these things do not come by doing something. These things happen from being within. Unless and until you do ascend in Sahaja Yoga, you will find it difficult.

After ascent, it will become so easy for you to establish this religion. Because you will see that so many children have been born from the womb of the same Mother. So many children have been born from My Sahasrara. Then the same brother-sister relationship will develop between them. Wherever this relationship breaks, wherever there is any flaw in it, wherever there is any problem in it -you will see immediately that your chakra will catch. And it will catch completely, and your vibrations will stop. And you will say that “Mother, what happened?” If your eyes wander here and there, even here while meditating, I will not do anything. Your vibrations stop. I do not do anything. You yourself stopped it. I did not do anything. Vibrations of many people stop. Especially old people, I say this especially. It is a very surprising thing, that young people can control it because their powers are still intact but if old people get into these habits, then it is difficult to get rid of them. Old people who have such habits, their old age has come, but the bhut badha has come on their Agnya Chakra. That is why old people have to pay special attention here in this way, so that they maintain their purity.

In this world, we have our daughters, our sisters, our mothers, this is the sacred relationship that should be considered. And you will have to establish this [marital] relationship only with your wife. And even if your wife is bad, evil, whatever, you have got this according to your deeds of your previous life. Whatever explanation you give, God will not accept that explanation. Because your vibrations will stop. Whatever it may be, this is your fate. These are fruits of your past; these mistakes of yours have already happened. Ask God for forgiveness for that. Ask Him for forgiveness. Correct it. You can make a lot of difference to your wife also through Sahaja Yoga. You must tolerate her. But on that pretext, if any Sahaja Yogi says that “No sir, I will do this, I will do that and will do wrong things,” then your vibrations will stop, whether anything else happens or not. This has come in indulgences.

Another very bad thing that comes in abstinence is fanaticism. A person becomes fanatic. I am a true Hindu, a fanatic Hindu. I am a fanatic Muslim. When one becomes fanatic, the dagger is used. The person who becomes fanatic, his vibrations disappear. Recently a girl came to Delhi. Very interesting cases had come in Delhi. They come here rarely. She had migraine for many days, so much. How do I know who she is? What is it? She came, I said, “It is okay, sit down.” I asked, “Do you have any fanaticism?” So she said, “I don’t have any, I remember God a lot.” I said, “Which God?” She said, “I am from Hindu religion. So I believe in all the Gods of Hindu religion.” I said, “Okay, look child, you do this, take the name of Janak ji here on the Nabhi Chakra. You can take the name of Dattatreyaji. He is your Adiguru, she did it. She said it doesn’t make any difference. I said, “Okay, you put your fingers in your ears and say, “Allah Ho Akbar” and take the name of [Mohammad] Paigambar Sahib.”

Immediately her headache went away. She said, “Mother, this is amazing. What was the reason for my headache?” I said, “Because you are a fanatic.” If you hate someone, you will definitely have a headache. Most of the diseases are in you because you hate someone for some reason or the other, on some pretext or the other. Why will God help such people? You tell Me. That you hate even more? If you hate someone more, then will God give you more power? Or that you will get sick? He also hates you. Hatred is such a thing that man has a parabola of it. It goes towards others and only hatred comes back. If you have love others, then love goes away and asks for love only.

Due to this, all your other six enemies are like this. All of them can be freed only when you connect with others. If you say that I should control myself, I should control my mind. I should control my anger. Then you will become [unclear]. If you try to correct lying, then you will go and gamble. Everything is conditioning. But unless and until your connection with the supreme is established, with the supreme principle, this cannot happen. There is another thing due to which your vibrations stop. There is no ego in saying this, but the truth is that you got vibrations only through Sahaja Yoga. The day you do anything against Sahaja Yoga or say anything against Me - even if I am not angry, but the ganas are sitting there; they will finish you immediately.

Many people do not know this, and they think that we have ourselves got it and we will do something [unclear]. This is happening due to some special power. Otherwise it would not have happened till today. Now there is no harm in telling this to you. Because many of you have witnessed this thing. This is happening due to some special power. And this is not going to happen by your doing. Many people think that if we also do it, then we will become. In this way, there was a lady in Delhi itself to whom I gave realization. And after giving realization, she developed the feeling that, “Now I have also become Mataji.” And she started teaching everyone to do this, do that, “come to my feet, touch my feet. Do this, do that.” Her vibrations stopped, and there is no doubt. But the vibrations of all those who had touched her feet stopped. So they came to Me crying that “Mataji, he was saying that after you I am the one.” I said, “I did not say so.” “Now what should we do?”

This is also a very important thing which should be understood. Because you got it for free. You have got your vibrations. Therefore, this should also be understood that this miracle which has happened, did not happen just like that. There is some special power at play in it. And this had not happened till date. It is unparalleled and was not even talked about. What has happened today, why has it happened? Till date no one had told that on this finger or on this finger, it works on these chakras. And not only this, but the evolving of others is also of a special power which has been given in your hand.

Today I have to say this openly that this is a matter of wisdom for you. If you have wisdom, if you think and understand this, then you can know that you cannot get these vibrations anywhere. And you cannot get them anywhere. There is no doubt that these are your own. But unless you are completely dedicated to where you got them from and the person who did this work, the flow of your vibrations cannot take place. And at least 50% of the people here are giving testimony to this. Surrender. It does not happen without surrender. And man is so egoistic. We gave him vibrations. We cured him. We did everything to him. We even explained everything to him. Even then he does not surrender within. But now if a half-baked produces a ring and gives it to someone blind [ignorant], then he will fall at his feet. Selling everything, will go to his feet. Leaving everything, they will write poems on him, books on him. Will write this on him, will write that on him.

But you know there are such people here. On whom we are thinking of filing a [legal] case. That they stole My speech from here and sold it there as their own. There are such people here too. They don’t have vibrations. What’s the point of writing a book? How much will you write? You know what, there is an ocean lying here. I say a few things and you will write them in the book. What difference is it going to make. Society, the world will come to know the reality; if not today, then tomorrow. And people will spit on those people. I say there is no need, why file a case against such people? They will go away due to their own karma. Because it is okay, you must write. Because this is the truth, you will have to say it. But you will have to say where it has come from. This is the law of God.

If you want to work without My photo, you cannot. And if someone thinks that the work will be done without My photo, then it will not be done. Many people here can tell you about this, so if you ask them, they can tell you. That this is absolutely true without Mataji’s name and photo, no work can be done. This place is on the Sahasrara. Therefore, it is essential to have my name in the mantra of Sahasrara. One day we had gone to a guru. He is himself realized, himself. But the ego is still there in him. And in that ego, when he started taking the name, he said, “I will just say Mataji, I will not say Mataji Nirmaladevi.” Everyone’s Sahasrara got closed. Later, he complained to one of our disciples there that, “What is the matter? This mantra does not work, Sahasrara does not open. What happened?” She said, “Okay, recite the mantra!” When he started saying it, she saw that they very nicely took out that name. She said, “Without Mataji, this is not going to work on Sahasra. I will show you now.” As soon as she started taking My name, their own vibrations started flowing freely within the three names. Although they were realised long ago. This is true.

Today I want to say this openly in front of you so that you can clear the misunderstandings. Because of this, there was a lot of trouble in Delhi. A lot of trouble. And because of that trouble, the vibrations of many people were lost. Then there also I had to tell them openly, and today I am telling you again openly. There is no question of suppressing your ego in this. I am your Mother. You should know this. The person who hesitates in accepting his Mother and avoids Her eyes, he does not have religion at all, this should be understood. You have received vibrations from Me, and I am your Mother. You have to accept this. You have nothing to lose in this. You were not born without a mother. There is no bigger fool than the person who says that he was born without a mother. You have not received vibrations from the air. If that could happen, then My coming here would have been in vain.

So accept your Mother. Mother’s [unclear] is very big. Jesus Christ who was such a great man, even on the cross He asked his mother, “Mother where is Your Son? And where are You?” Even there on that cross, when blood was flowing from His body, even then He remembered His Mother. Those who can forget their mother can forget everything in the world. No religion of the whole world, national religion, social religion, no religion can come inside a person who does not believe in his mother. That is why you have received the vibrations, and those who are going to receive them should know that mother has a complete relation with it and is their right. Although you cannot give anything in it. It is only your right. You have the right to take. I have the right to give. I have nothing to take from you. But if your vibrations are lost tomorrow, then again I am not going to tell you. You should understand this. This is the evidence for every person. And there are many such people here. those who have experienced it, have done experiments and have seen it.

Tomorrow I will tell you another thing which is very important, what you call bhut badha etc. What is that thing? Does it exist or not? And how does it act? And what is its effect? ​​I will tell you all this in detail tomorrow. But today I have talked about Yoga, Hatha Yoga, which works on Surya Nadi, mostly. Now if you have any questions, ask them. Then we will go into meditation. Whoever has any questions, ask them. Whoever has any questions, ask them.

Question: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: What, you do not understand this much [Hindi] also. Ask your question, in Marathi.

Question: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Now it’s like this, every day I have played the same record. Today I have put a different record, felt, make you laugh. On Sahaja Yoga, you only need to understand that saha-ja. “Saha” means together and “ja” means born. These people have given an article on it, so you read it. There is no need to read on Sahaja Yoga; its language is mute, and it happens spontaneously. Like a seed – how is it born, how does it sprout, we understand. It happens spontaneously, without any speech. Th way a seed sprouts. In the same way the seeds within you sprout on their own and you attain that new state on your own. That, in simple words, is Sahaja Yoga.

If I were to give a speech on it, it would be a waste, a waste. Because if you want to light a lamp, if you just want to turn on the fan, just press the button. But it is not that simple. It is easy to turn on, so I say, first light your lamps, then I will tell you. That is going on daily - what is Sahaja Yoga, what is Sahaja Yoga. Even if you are new, you will get realisation. You will get realised. Those who are sick – yes, what is it, tell Me.

Question: [unclear].

Shri Mataji: No. No, no, I tell you son, he should not understand anything. What does he have to understand? He is uneducated, small children, they get over it quickly. He does not have any education. This is nature’s own process. It has no education. The more educated you are, the more difficult it is for Me. The more educated you are, may God save you from them. I get a headache. The less educated you are, the better it is. Because after education, that too has an ego, a strange kind of ego in that person. There is no need to know anything. You first turn on the light. Do you need to know how to turn on this light? There is no need to know anything. Just press the button and it will light up. Then after that I will explain engineering to you, right? I have explained it to everyone, I will explain it to you too. Whatever is the most secret of all, whatever manifestation of the Goddess took place, the way she worked with Shakti and what She is going to do today in this Kaliyuga, I will tell you all about it. There is no doubt about it.

Question: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: There is no need to have any faith. Not at all. You should not have faith at all. But this does not mean that you are a disbeliever. Keep it open, keep your mind open. There is no question of having faith. Sometimes, by having faith, there is some other fault, that you come with utmost faith in Me, this can be the fault. You do not need to have faith. Why are you moving, sit quietly. You do not need to have faith. There is no need to do any such thing. You just sit as you are sitting. Suddenly, the light will come inside you. Do you have to believe in the sun? Nothing. Do these leaves believe in the sun, whose colour turns green, due to the sunlight. Everything happens on its own. Whether you believe or not, God is there. It does not matter whether you believe or not. Neither faith is needed, nor its education is needed. Neither any force is needed for it, or any power is needed for it that you are standing on your head or dancing or jumping. Nothing is needed. Do not bring any expression on your face. This is not about cheating anyone here. You have to achieve it yourself. I see many people making such a funny face, sometimes laughing, sometimes something else. They think that by doing this they will create some impression. The impression should fall on God. If you have accumulated it then it happens. If not today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow. Why are you shaking, control yourself.

Question: Is there reincarnation? [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, there are many births, if you ask me, I will say that there are rebirths. You will come to know the truth of it later. You can prove it too. But you should not go to your previous life. The reason for that is that I have seen that the mind of Hindus who are Hindus today, they must have been Muslims earlier. The feeling of rebirth is very strong in their mind. Because of that they live more in the past, what were we in our previous birth? You must have been anything. What of today? Now, the present, this moment, this is the important thing. That is why you should not pay attention to rebirth. Whatever it is, rebirth must have happened, there is no harm. I am sitting here only to consume whatever karma you have; I am sitting here only to absorb it. Do everything, but just do this much that sit with love, with love towards yourself, and with love towards the whole society. Just look at yourself with love. Do not be bigoted towards anyone. Do not have hatred towards anyone. Live with utmost love. Then who should be removed from your mind, who are the demons? Who are the devils? I will tell you that also later.

Question: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Yes, you have crossed over. I have seen something similar about crossing over, that we imagine that crossing over means that we have become Krishna. It is not like that. What does not happen does not happen, what happens, happens. There is nothing that I can say about it. First thoughtlessness comes within you. As soon as the Kundalini crosses the Agnya Chakra, you will become thoughtless. A kind of blankness will come within you. But there will be a lot of heaviness in the head. Lightness is not going to come. And when the Kundalini crosses the Agnya Chakra and pierces the Brahmarandhra, then first of all you will become absolutely light. You will feel something like a cold, cold wave coming in your hands. In some people it will feel hot in the beginning. As soon as the cold starts coming, lightness will also start coming. In a little while, after that much time, you will suddenly feel lightness and from inside it will seem that you have become thoughtless, but you are completely alert, completely alert. It means that you are not asleep. You will feel that you are alert.

Then after that many people say that “Mataji, after we have become thoughtless, we should become absolutely doubtless.” It should happen. This is our wish, but it does not happen. Out of this, we have worked hard on people for five-six years, out of that, I would say that 5% people are such, that once they have crossed, they stand on the point of thoughtlessness. There are such people also. There are many such people, who stay very far behind. I know where the points are, where they are sitting. But there are very few such people. Most people ascend into thoughtlessness. What does it mean that you come here in the middle and stay around that. From here you see both your ego and super ego and you can bring them down as well; you can remove them. There are many methods of it, you can remove them. After that you can learn all the methods, all its postures, its method, this way of turning in this way and all this. We will teach you that.

But you will keep getting caught. But you will know that you have been caught. I mean, just now, as I said, I went to meet Janardan Swamiji. As I went, he is a great saint, he is a man of the Nagapanthi, and he is realised. So as soon as he saw Me, he said, “Mother, my Agnya and my Vishuddhi are caught. Please clear them both.” It means that you see that your Agnya and Vishuddhi are caught. I mean you start seeing. Awareness comes inside you. You still do not know - “where is my heart going and where am I going?” But when you get realisation in Sahaja Yoga, you immediately feel that something is rising from here, something is going away. Then you feel that it has caught here, it has caught there. Then you remove it by doing this or that, it will go away. Do something here and it will go away. We tell you how to remove it.

It means you and your motorcar get separated. Then you can also clean your motorcar. You can also repair it. This thing happens first when a person becomes thoughtless. But even after you become thoughtless, until your condition settles down a little bit, in faith - because now faith starts, after knowing - when the vibrations have come, then you have to come in faith. Then you come here as if forced to, you don’t know whether you should come or not, whether it is happening or not. If you keep doing it like this, then it is not going to work out. As soon as you get a little steadiness in it, you will see that you will awaken the Kundalinis of people with your hands. You will awaken the Kundalini. Not only this, you will awaken the Kundalini. Sir, read it. No, no, read it. Don’t want to read it? Alright, give it here.

Question: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: You can do it anytime. There is no restriction of time. Once you are realised and there is a little bit of doubtless awareness, then you remain in meditation. You remain in meditation. You remain in meditation all the time. Then what sootak (inauspicious time), who, what? And who, what? You remain in meditation all the time. But special days do have some effect. Like on Mahashivaratri, there is a special form [unclear]. All these days have great importance. That day I had put everyone in the air-conditioner. Everyone was shivering, so that can happen. But still, if your mind is sad on the day of sootak, then you should remain in meditation even more. There is never any inauspiciousness in it. There will never be any inauspiciousness in it, that means you will be surprised. There was a gentleman who was caught by the badha, you can understand. And because of him, ten more Sahaja yogis were caught. Now the ten Sahaja yogis were already very impressed by him to begin with; now they caught him. So I said that you should write down [his name] and hit him [the name] with twenty-five shoes. Twenty-one means twenty-one shoes [beating].

They hit him with twenty-one shoes. These people did not get cleared but he got cleared. Because these ten people hit him with those shoes ten times and these people were hitting themselves only once. Even if you hit him with shoes, you will still get cleared. Whatever you do, you will be saved. If I scold you, you will still be saved. If I love you, you will still be saved. That means you will be saved. This is not going to lead to destruction, it is going to lead to salvation. If you say, “Mataji, so and so is troubling me a lot, please kill him.” If I go to hit him, he will be saved. He will become good and come here. There will be transformation. Nothing else is going to happen. Like now if someone says, remove him. This minister is not good, remove him. I said, why remove him, why not transform him? If we change that, then transformation will happen. No person will get out of it, will not move away.

Transformation will happen. If someone is very wicked, he will get disturbed. He will have trouble. Then gradually he will also come back in My sphere. This is the method of transformation. Then you can scold him, beat him, do anything to him. Give vibrations, think about him. You can put a bandhan on him. You will see that his transformation will happen. No one is going to be harmed. Now, like there are many people who say, “my mother-in-law troubles me a lot.” I said okay. If I cannot hit my mother-in-law with a chappal, then it will be unrighteous. So okay, you keep putting a bandhan on her, in the name of mother-in-law. In a few days, I came to know that mother-in-law had come. Her face turned completely rosy; her health became very good. And she started saying, “I am feeling so much love for you, I don’t know why I am feeling so much love for you.” She was surprised that is this her?

How did this happen? She also started looking young. A glow came on her face too. This will only lead to transformation. Because man has the capability to become God and also the capability to become a demon. That is why man will go towards God. Whatever you do for him, if you even think about that man in your mind, he will be reduced to half at that very moment. You may hit him, scold him, beat him. Do anything. It will be good for him. After reaching a certain state. It is not that you have crossed the limit, and you start killing. One thing should be understood, know it. This is a method of transformation, it is transformation. It is not about changing someone. It is about changing something. Man changes. Do you have any other question?

Question: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: No, it is not like that. It is not a matter of leaving it. But one has to learn its shastra. Now as we tell you, it is a simple matter, that most people take the name of Ram, most people. Here, many people have this disease. Now Ram is situated in your Heart chakra. Now they take the name of Ram, the Heart chakra remains caught by them. Because what happens is that the path from where the name is to be taken is closed and you are hitting that. You are hitting. Because of this, your name of Ram will remain caught. So now if the Heart chakra of such a person is caught, then after realization, while giving realization, we take the name of Ram only. But we have a connection, that is why its door opens. But even then he should be careful. That he should not hurt his Heart chakra too much. Understand this if a person has stomach cancer. And he is taking the name of Krishna, then he is not going to get any benefit from it. He should take the name of some Guru. Because the Vaishnavi power of religion has to be used - for cancer.

Now, if someone’s Vishuddhi Chakra is caught, that means Vishuddhi Chakra, by the name of Vishuddhi Chakra, the first thing it will catch, then the chakra whose name you take will catch. Whoever has recited names, it is a difficult task and whoever takes extreme names, it is extremely difficult. So, if you have done recital of names from here, for Krishna, then only this will catch. But if you did it for someone, for Shivji, then the Hridya Chakra and this combination got stuck. Now both have to be freed. Well, then we will free it from Shivji. And we will free it from Krishna only. Now you should know which chakra of yours is caught and which name you should take to free it. Even Sandhya, or any other thing, when you do not know the shastras, working according to non-shastras is against Sahaja Yoga. Everything is very much by the shastra, it has its protocol, its method, its way. We keep telling this on every matter.

For example, we went to Haridwar. There is a gentleman sitting here, he is also a very accomplished man. But he, poor fellow, I had told him that, “Gangaji cannot rise above My head. So, please do not pour water on My head, even if it falls somewhere else. But be careful, do not pour it on My head.” But he may not have heard, maybe. Maybe. He sprinkled some water on My head. Immediately, Ganga started pulling him away. I knew, as soon as the water fell, I first caught hold of his feet. He was saved, but he had 107-degree fever for seven days. There is a protocol for everything. If you sit with your feet towards Me, the vibrations disappear. There is respect for everything. People of India know this. Even God forgives the American people, they do not know. Because they do not understand anything. How does it happen? Everything is accomplished the way it should be done.

There is faith, there is a way. There is a protocol. Which finger should you use to apply kumkum? It is for each and every thing. This finger is for your Agnya Chakra. In each and every thing, you should know where you should use this finger. Where should you use this? What does it mean? Gradually you will learn all things which are called ritualism. Where did it come from? Why did it come? What is the meaning of Omkar? You should understand everything. All these things have meaning. And prayer is to pray to God. Namaaz, baptism, you can understand the meaning of all these things only in Sahaja Yoga. Because now for the first time your vibrations have started. Unless that electricity comes inside you, how will you show its use, it will be just empty talk. This fan will start working. This will start happening. First electricity should come. What can happen without it? Like there are buttons for everything here, you are pressing one button, and then another thing is happening. After learning all its shastras, you have been doing like a blind person till today, you will have to leave that completely in the beginning. When you leave it completely, then learn everything according to its shastras, understand everything, then you will know.

Like today itself he asked what is the establishment of kumbha? I told him about that for half an hour. He said that this is not written anywhere in the shastras. I said, “What would have been the use of writing it at that time? Today you people understand so I am telling you.” You will say that “Mother we have never read about many things. It was not like that.” But it will be evident, meaning you will be able to see that such and such things exist. Right now these people sitting here are doing such and such hand movements, they all know that which chakra is caught where? How do we have to raise the Kundalini? How do we have to take bondage? All these people know. Those who do not know, they think that we do not know what are they doing? What mantra vidya are they doing?

There is a way to do this. There is a method to this. Right now if anyone’s Agnya chakra gets caught then he will sit like this. By the way, you can clean all your chakras with your thoughts. When your speed becomes high then you do not move your hands and legs so much; that it reduces a little. On reaching a slightly high speed, the person then cleans that thing with his mind only. That thing can be cleansed only through the attention. Okay, now let us go into meditation. Those who are ill, troubled, they should also extend their hands. And come into meditation for at least four days. In four days you will become a little more steady. Steadiness is required. There is no guarantee for anyone. It has to happen. You close your eyes. And if you get realisation, then I will know. But you people also close your eyes and see if you are feeling something cool inside. And if your thoughts have become still, then you should see inside yourself. Don’t look at others. If a person comes, you open one eye and look at him. If there is such restlessness, then nothing will ever happen. Peacefully.
