Talk Arzier, Talk on Children at Girvins Ashram (Switzerland), 21 September 1990.

And so there are many hunters who are trying to find out this castori, this musk, and they are looking they are looking for the deer. So please keep your deer, that is the innocence, you see.

The children’s innocence is now attacked, under attack, and there is such an attack coming on innocence that you have to care, be careful about your own children. Harane means those deer, because deer is a small thing, so be careful about those deer, look after them. The full term is keep them clear, keep them safe.

A time may come when we will feel our own breathing as something stranger as if they are not our own, stranger, that’s why keep your hands into each other because it is very dark. Very nice message for all the Sahaja Yogis. And this is what one has to understand that you must try to understand your leader.

I wanted to talk to the collectivity here today about what has happened in Switzerland, also that, you see, we had Arneau here, and Arneau became a very right-sided and this and that. So as a result of that, Swiss people have become the other way round, I think. And it's a kind of a feeling that as Arneau was, there's a pressure I think, on the new leader who is a very good man and he is very good. So if you pressurize, then nothing will work out. So please remember that you have to listen to your leaders, till I do something about it. Even about Arneau, I stood by him out and out, and when he was wrong we removed him. So nobody should challenge the leader, otherwise there cannot be any one of My authorities - nothing can flow. It's like stopping completely the flow of Kundalini. So don't challenge your leaders. I find that there is a big, I find here very clearly, the Agnya is rising in people. People are developing Agnyas, and that is coming only because one thinks, "Oh, that was Arneau. He did like this... and now Mathias. So Mathias must be also like that, for he is authority." That's not the way. You have to accept his authority. If you don't accept his authority, your Agnya will be caught up and you will become very right-sided people. Be extremely careful. I am noticing that the Agnya in Switzerland is quite high and I must tell you, warn you, that be sensible. My whole energy flows through your leader, till he stops it. So I am in charge there to look after that point. Now you people have to learn to surrender yourself. Otherwise your ego will go up very much and you will all, I am sure, if you go on like this, one by one become very egoistical.

Now, how ego comes so much to the West, I have studied it and I have found out the reason for this why these people in the West are so ego-oriented. What is the reason? The reason is like this: a child till the age of five years is ego-oriented. He plays with his own, you give them toys they will all have their own toys, they will play with them and they will not trouble each other. But if they trouble each other, then they become violent or they could be quite brutal also. They are always living in a parallel way. You do your job; I do my job. If you leave them, "This is mine. This is mine," they'll all play alone. And they are at that time absolutely ego-oriented.

If you ask a child, "You are standing there, now what do you see?" so he'll see this chair, he'll see Me, he'll see this and that. From there, if you ask, he won't say that he sees something else - he will say same as he sees here - he is standing this side, but he will never see the point of another person. That's the child. Say, for example, there is a wall here, the child is standing here and there is something in between. So you ask the child, "What will you see from the other side?" He will say the same thing from where he is standing. He won't be able to say what the other person is seeing. So that is this ego-orientation, is very strong.

And because you people, I must say this is a very, I think, a statement I have to make very clearly that in your culture whatever is - so today's culture of these countries, today's I am saying - is that it just develops your ego. Parents are very happy if you are busy with yourself. They don't want to take up any responsibility, they don't want to correct you, they don't want to tell you, "Don't do this, don't do that," and whichever way the children are going, they are going. They don't want to worry. Even, what I have noticed in the ashrams also, if somebody corrects the child, they have a big objection. They are very sensitive about their children, and this is very bad because this will make the children extremely ego-oriented. And in the West I have seen people are extremely sensitive about their children. Nobody dare say anything to them.

But the other way round, I must say that Indian culture has still kept very sensible ways. That's why their society is the best in the whole world. Their economics is horrible, their politics is worst, you can call them absolutely useless for many things, but on society level, they are the best. The reason is that the women have taken over the responsibility of looking after the society.

Now I'll tell you we were quite grown up, I was in college, my sisters were also in college. One day we were coming by, walking down, and we were just, there was some joke so they all started laughing, there were some friends also. And one lady was going by car - my mother's friend. So she went and told my mother that "I saw your daughters with other friends and they were laughing on the street." As soon as we went she shouted, "How dare you?" We got a fright, and we didn't know this lady was coming from that side. She said, "How dare you? How could you do?" - at that age. And anyone of her friends could scold us, anybody. Can say anything to us, "Don't do like this. Why are you doing like this?" So this ego breaks.

But if you do not allow others to correct your children, their ego will never break, and that is the reason why in these countries - Western countries - people are so ego-oriented. They have not grown out of it. They have not grown out of it.

First of all, they never want to be corrected, never. Even at this age, if My mother was living she would have corrected Me. And I would never have felt bad - anybody, anyone of our friends or anybody - because I know that it's for My benevolence why are they doing it. But a kind of a, you see, thing that happened here, that Arneau went too much on one side. He got possessed, went too much, and this is also by some other people also. Also Patrick is having the same problem there, and everybody is having the same problem in every ashram.

Now it is not that you should dominate your children or anything, but if they are doing wrong, immediately the person who sees he's doing wrong can correct it. There should not be that, "This is my child. How dare you say like that?" or feel bad about it. Once you start developing that kind of "my children, mine," children then become absolutely ego-oriented, and you'll never allow them to grow out of it. They can never see what is the other's point of view.

Now say, for example, we learnt it through, not only through our mother, father, but through everybody else. They said, "You should not do like this." So many things we know - little, little things. Like these girls told Me - not these but from another ashram, not in Switzerland - that, "Look at them. They come from the heat and just take the water, drink it." In India nobody would do. How, how do we know? Because if anybody sees us doing that, he'll say, "No, you should eat something, take some carbohydrate, then drink water. Why did you take it?" And nobody will object.

So the whole society is training the children. Nobody has any objection. Guido had a problem also, same way. He tried to correct the children, the parents used to comment - In India nobody dare say anything to the teacher. That's why the teachers are respected. If teacher said so, all right. They have no respect for their teachers.

They have no respect - after all, they don't even have respect for their parents. because they discover that we are ego-oriented. Here, the way children talk to their parents, the way they behave, they have no respect for anyone, and then they have no respect for themselves. They become absolutely shameless people. So, to make your children grow properly, allow them to get into collectivity completely. I mean, now My husband's family, we have got hundred people at least. When we come together for any marriage, festival or anything, we are at least minimum hundred people living under one roof, one kitchen. And everybody knows how far to go. Nobody feels bad. I mean they, of course, love children also, they do everything for them - but if it is to be corrected, it is to be corrected, and nobody feels bad.

And this is why the children get attached too much, and it's impossible to penetrate into their ego shell. It goes on, you see, growing, growing, growing. And even if they get realization later on, even if they feel, the ego is still there because it's already bloated out by the parents, parents have already put that ego into their heads that, "You are something special." And this is how it is. I mean, the other day, I mean, my younger daughter - she is quite big and all that - she was in there and she started scolding her daughter. So Worlikar came and said, "Please don't scold. I will not listen anymore of this." She just kept quiet. She didn't feel bad about it. She didn't feel bad because, you see, we Indians understand this. Anybody can correct us, and we take it as good thing.

Thank God there is somebody to correct us. Otherwise we will be hanging from the trees. Like Avdhut once asked Me when he was small, he said, "Supposing we leave our parents, then the bhoots go away - what parents have - their bhoots go away?" I said, "No, they will go with you." So he said, "Then why do these people leave their parents? Because supposing I go away from my parents and tomorrow I feel like smoking, who will correct me? There is nobody to correct me if my parents are not with me." I mean, that is regarded as something, a great blessing that you have parents, your elders, to correct you, to tell you something.

And when my daughters got married, we were big people - I mean, we were not young or anything, CP was the Chairman of Shipping Corporation and all that - his sister, she is about eight, nine years older, she said, "For this marriage you have to paint your nails." Now imagine CP painting his nails. He did paint. He painted, and then he had to wear dhoti ten times. He had to do this, he was quite (inaudible). We went to another marriage in the, something. He said, "Look at them. They are also wearing suits and everything." I said, "Thank God we have, you have a sister." Somebody who will tell you what is to be done.

This obedience you must learn. Unless and until you learn obedience and anybody corrects your child, don't say anything. Just don't say anything. Let your child be handled by everyone. Otherwise it's going to be very bad for them also. Though they are born-realized, you are not giving them the right training, no. "My children" should be dropped out immediately. They are children of everyone. Now Anand came and stayed with him. Ask him what sort of a boy he was.

Sahaja Yogi: A gem.

Shri Mataji: Gem of a person. If, if he tells him, "Anand, don't do like this," he will never feel bad, never. We feel it's a blessing there is somebody to tell us.

And then this is what I find later on that ego is like a balloon. If the balloon, if you do not blow at all- it is not blown out, then it's difficult to blow it. That's why those who have not developed this ego are very easy. That's why Indians don't get into this ego trip easily. Their balloon is never allowed to grow. But those who are in the West, they are nothing but ego. You do something, you know, balloon starts.

Then we had one (inaudible) with us, and whenever he got into the car, he used to become very funny, you know, very bumptious. So I asked somebody, "Why is he so bumptious?" He said, "Mother because he is driving Mercedes." I said, "What? Mercedes? This is neither his nor Mine . Why should he be proud of it?" I mean, something stupid.

So an ego makes you stupid. That's the main thing: it makes you completely stupid. And there is a big story about it in Ramayana. how a person can become stupid. And that's why you people are stupefied very easily.

Recently somebody told Me, "Mother, the new fashions have started that they take, all the ladies take their hair like this on their forehead." I said, "Really?" She said, "Yes, you see, Mother." I saw all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair made like that. Yesterday also in the program all of them having hair like this. I mean, they have no personality. Anybody starts anything, they'll do it. They have no individuality. They do not have any traditional basis. "No, this is modern dress. I am not going to wear something like this. This is how I dress up, this is how I live. Why, why should I do it?" Now, tomorrow they'll say that you have a bouffant. So everybody going with a bouffant.

They will say men should have, women should have put no oil. So they will become bald-headed, - finished. But, you see, about twenty years back every man you see in the films used to put the hair, oil in the hair, properly comb it, and used to be a smart fellow. Nowadays, everybody is so casually dressed there's nothing smartness about them. If you become casual, you'll also in life will be casual. To wear some sort of a casual thing, some sort of a baggy pant or a tight pant or this and that, this is because there is no personality. Is only ego. There is no personality; there's no wisdom.

To allow your children to be corrected by others is the first thing you, good thing you do to your children. Let them have respect for others. Let them feel, "They are also my uncles. They are also my aunties. They can correct me." Then, to obey and not to question too much.

I mean, here every child there was, once I was traveling with a Sahaja Yogini. Her son was all the time asking, "Why this? Why that?" and she was answering him. I said, "You shut up now," to that boy, and after that he never asked her why. As if they have a right to ask you, they go on asking questions. How dare they ask you questions? You are parents. We don't ask questions to our parents - never, never. We are no way less than anybody else in this world. On the contrary, I must say that in that culture those people who have come up are very good Sahaja Yogis. They are very sensible. They understand how far to go, what to do.

So what is we have to understand that our Sahaja Yoga culture is such that we have to learn certain things. First of all, at least please don't make your children so much what you call ego-oriented. Don't make them ego-oriented, please.

See that your children respect all of them the same way, they say "Namaste" to everyone, and they are very, very obedient to everyone and even if somebody corrects them, what's the harm? I am really surprised because in the West I used to think that the children are not attached to their parents or anything, but it's not so, because they are glued to parents. Not only glued, but as soon as they get a chance they run away from the parents, because you dote too much on their heads, you see. That's why. There is no freedom. All the time they are jealous. I have heard also of ladies who are jealous of Me because I am the Mother. Yes, so stupid. I find, I mean if supposing somebody mothers my child I will look after that lady. I'll send her a sari. I'll send her a present. I'll be very happy that you have looked after my child. Reactions are so funny, isn't it? Why such responses and reactions?

Like supposing you have music program in here, your neighbors will come, go to the police, call everybody. Otherwise, even if you are dying they will not be bothered. On the contrary, in India supposing you have a music, "Oh God, they are going to have the music." It's all right . Bring everything, carpets for them, everything. Give them food - "What will you have?" and the whole area will be there to help you and this and that. And they'll sleep nicely, if they want to sleep. Their collectivity is very good and you see their children, anybody scolds any child there, anybody. Because you are ego-oriented, please be careful don't make your children also ego-oriented. It's so difficult for you to get rid of your egos, you know that. Anything, you know, like a snake is there, again back. Then I used to wonder how is it their ego comes up? This (inaudible) told Me, "My husband, you know, Mother, what is this ego, ego, ego?" I said, "What?" "He always tells me I have got ego, ego, ego. What is this?" she asked Me. "What is this disease, ego? Ego, ego, ego?" I said, "You see, it means Ahamkar." She said, "Then why does he boast of it?" Ahamkar is a sin. Even to say "I hate you," it's a sinful thing to say. I mean, in Hindi language if you say, "I hate you," they'll say, "Are you mad or what?" They think you must be mad. You cannot say that I commit this sin. So this is what it is, and anybody who is treated like that, even in India, can become bad - even in India - pampered too much by parents or sort of made too much of them and all that.

But we know our parents love us, they care for us. My mother was such a strict person as far as strictness, but today why I am cooking so well? Because of My mother. She used to tell Me even how to hold the - what you call - the spoon. When I was a very small little girl about five years old, I know, Then we have this tawa, is a very black thing, round, where we make rotis. She used to tell Me, "Clean it." And we had so many servants in the house but still, and I remember My small little white hands all becoming black like this, you see, and I would clean it. But I am very good at cleaning. I am very good at everything. How? It's thanks to My mother. Nothing doing.

Now at least make your children get up in the morning. We have to give something better to our children better training.

Same I have seen with ladies. Now ladies must understand that those who live here or in any ashram, they are the housewives and they have to know. I was surprised when I asked the people who have come from all the way, "What did you have?" They said, "Nothing. We had those samosas and something to eat. That's all." I mean, that they are guests in the house. Nobody had anything. I was having all kinds of food but I never knew that they are making like this. I mean, not to feel bad. Otherwise if I say something you'll catch on Center Heart, not for that. This is another specialty because of ego only. This is because there is nothing goes inside the head; nothing goes inside the heart. It goes into some center, you know. Mother said so? All right, Center Heart is catching, or my Left Vishuddhi is catching. Baba, but no, why don't you correct your brain? Because we don't want to face it. We don't want to correct it. So put it in the Left Vishuddhi or in the Center Heart.

Now if some guests come to your house - Gregoire will tell you, one day they were all there, about twenty-five of them, sitting in the gallery. My daughter was there. I went and told her that, "They are there, they may stay on longer. So you better cook for all of them." She had done the cooking. When we finished - remember, Gregoire, we finished our program - I said, "Let's have dinner." So they were surprised. They said, "How?" I said, "I told her. She must have prepared." "In such a short time?" I said, "Yes, she must have prepared.' She said, "Dinner is ready." We were all there. She said if you tell somebody that twenty-five people are going to come, the women will be finished, like that. They'll be thinking, "Now, I have to go for shopping..." They start ... And there is no confidence.

There is no, because no personality, no personality. My husband, I told him yesterday that I have made pulao for people, hundred people, that's all. I didn't do too much. He said, "Hundred people is nothing?" I said, "No, nothing. Five hundred would have been more, but -" but not only Me, My daughter can do it. You have seen her in Pratishthan. My daughters can do it. So we have self-confidence, you see, about anything you tell us.

Now all of your programs you have seen, you go on the tours, how Indians arrange everything, in jungles, in anything. But here first we start thinking, thinking, because we don't want to face the problem. "We have to do it now. Let's do it." "That's not so. Let us sit down but plan out," you're finished then.

Now I have studied you too well. I have been here, I am amazed, also. And there is no training because your mother also avoids to train you. There is no training - nothing. They don't know anything, I would say. They are still like little babies. There has to be, a girl must know how to stitch, a girl must know how to cook, a girl must know how to look after a household, and shopping, and she must know what is good meat, what is bad meat. She must know about what is a diamond, which is not a diamond; which is silk, which is not. All this is taught in the family. Whether you are a career girl or not - you are a career girl, all right - but this is the main thing. This is the basis for a woman to know. We are women without being women. And then a kind of a fondness, to do for others, to give something.

I will tell you about my granddaughter. When they were young, both, three of them, I asked them, "What you want to be?" They said, "We want to be a nurse or to be an air hostess." So I said, "Why these two?" She said, "You know, Grandma, only in these two professions you can give food to others to eat." See how, how they feel.

And recently about a year back - she is only 18, elder one - she invited twenty-five people for dinner. So I thought she is going to tell the servants or someone. She said, "No, I am going to do the cooking." And she did it and she fed everyone and everybody started praising. She said, "No, no, no. You know, they are just saying it because I have cooked but I know it's all insipid. It's all insipid. It's nothing good. But they are just saying it because I have cooked." For twenty-five people she cooked alone. Because they feel happy to do it, They're happy to give things to others. They are so happy, you don't know.

It's just you are so affluent, you are so rich, you have everything, but still there is no generosity. My husband is extremely generous but the other day there was a gentleman - a Sahaja Yogi. An elderly gentleman who was a teacher of art came to do a little drawing for Me. I said, "What to give?" I told C.P. "C.P., have you got any suit with you spare?" He said, "Maybe. Let's go and see." I said, "I've seen one. Will you see that?" That's an excellent suit he had. "Oh!" he said, "please give this one. Is very good. I have only used it once but I have never used it outside; just I have tried it. So if he likes, please give him." So he took the - and when I gave him he was very happy and he said, "Mother, I was looking out for a suit and I've wanted one suit." C.P.'s eyes were filled with joy, and his tears, He said, "You know, he wanted the suit, do you know? How nice we gave him what he wanted." See the delicacy of character - so overjoyed that he wanted the suit - and because I am very good at what one wants, you see, but he, he was so charmed and was so happy, and after such a long time I saw that joy in his eyes. "Oh God! So what he wanted, we gave him."

It's such a, after all, you see, what is there after all? What is the use of all these riches, these (inaudible) and things? What do we get? Nothing, no joy, nothing. First of all we think we are husband and wife, then to quarrel all the time, all right.

I don't think there is much love also there. I don't know about Sahaja Yogis, but otherwise, I don't know about Sahaja Yogis also.

Then that quarreling is over. Then "my child, my children." Then they also quarrel, they also fight, they also run away. By the age they are sixteen they are thinking where they are going to run away. Why do they run away? But our children stick like leeches. We have never made them like that but still they stick. Why? They are not ego-oriented. Because you are separated. You are a different identity. "I. I like this. I like that." I mean, it's a sin to say like that. Who are you to say, "I like"? "I" means what?

So all these things we have to change and we have to understand. Only possibility is in ashram life. How you respect, how you live, how you greet each and every person, how you behave: this is a culture we have to imbibe. If we have to give our children a very good time we have to imbibe.

I wouldn't say that in India we don't have funny people. We have people of loose characters, we have all kinds of things. But the number is so little that they do not influence. Here, the number is of the others are more than these. So they influence too much.

Everybody is putting their hair like this now. So you don't have your hair, you'll also feel like putting your hair like this. It's a, it's, I don't know why, and also this is a false idea that we should have our hair very disheveled. You see, I being this Goddess business I have to keep My hair open, but I keep them all right. They are not disheveled. I have to keep Mine because you know, Muktakeshi - keep Her hair open because of vibrations to flow. But I never, you would never find My hair jumbled up like that. Because then the bhoots catch you. They see, "This is the head. Oh, good one! It's is a jumbled head. Get into it!" Bhoots catch you much more in modern times than they used to catch because we live like bhoots. You know, on the street you go and find so many women, men dressed up just like bhoots. So bhoots can go. "This is the bhoot!" Why not they catch in India so many bhoots? Once somebody gets his realization, I have not met many those who catch bhoots. Because we dress up like that, we are ego-oriented, so the bhoots come in. I am not saying you should go to hairdressers and all that, but one should not have a face or a hair like a bhoot. Now if you want how a bhoot looks like, I will show you also.

So this is what one has to understand that there is something missing in our upbringing, which we have to change, and the change has to be that to make a good family, to have good children, we have to have certain ideas whom to respect, how to respect, how to understand.

I mean, like Gupta got angry with Dr. Talwar. So I told him, "You go and touch his feet." Immediately he did it. "He is elder than you, and you have no business to get angry. Go and touch his feet." Immediately he did, and he said, "See now, he provoked me, Mother, and I have got the bad name." I said, "You go and touch his feet," he touched his feet immediately, no question. Anybody answers anybody - a child, a younger person answers to anyone else - the father, mother will all the time, "Go and fall at his feet. Come along. Nothing doing." That's how they learn respect.

You are very good seekers. You are seeking the truth and all that but with that, to bear that truth, we have to have a kind of a culture that you can bear it. Otherwise, this ego will always shoot out, right side. The right side is the problem of the West. This you agree?

Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: But you will find this with your leaders, not with yourself. This is the problem. The one who has the authority to assert, you will find it with him, not with yourself, that you have this problem, isn't it true?

The wives of leaders also should know they are the mothers and they have to have an extremely sweet and a humble nature and they should tolerate lot of nonsense; not only that, but always try to soothe their husbands. I'll tell you, in My husband's office in Shipping Corporation all the people there depended on Me. If anything goes wrong, if C.P. is angry with them, they'll come and tell Me. Then I would slowly tell him, "Why should you be so angry with them? After all, you see, they are humans beings and they have done-" "Oh! So they come to you?" "Yes, they did." Then I would tell him, I would tell him, "Because they think I am more generous than you are." "All right, I am also more generous." Then he would be doing. So she should not think she is a leader - no, never.

She should think, "I am the mother of all these," now she should see the people who have come here: have they got food or not? Have they been attended to or not? These are guests, and guests are to be treated like gods.

And the trouble here is that everybody walks into your house like a guest, or stays with you like a guest, you see, like - you will be surprised, I had a house in Hounslow. So many Sahaja Yogis stayed there, never paid a single pie. I had to pay for electricity, gas, everything. From the very beginning since I have been in London, I have been paying for all that. Even Shudy Camp, most of the money I have paid, but there were twenty-five people living there when I went, not paying a single penny for anything. But Indian won't do that because of self-respect.

Now I am telling Mathias, "I have used your telephone this time many a times," and he has to take the money. If he doesn't take money I won't be able to sleep. So, use somebody's telephone as much as you like, use anybody's things as much as you like, stay there in their house so carelessly. It's so common in the West. I never knew. I used to think, "They are very upright people. They will never come to your house like that." Gregoire will tell you the whole story about it if you want to hear.

So now this ashram where you are living, even if you are coming from outside, you are Sahaja Yogis. You find something dirty, try to clean it. This is your house. So it has become like nobody's house now. Actually, it is everybody's house. Recently it has become nobody's house. So, not to feel bad, not to feel upset, not to feel that I am in any way trying to put you down, but I must tell you that this will develop your children's ego and your ego, too.

To live together, enjoy together, we have to have certain type of culture which is not in the West. West are very individualistic, extremely individualistic people, and they have this problem and they have suffered because of that. We want to create a new world of people who love each other, who will enjoy each other and who understand each other; not only that, but those who have collective consciousness manifested in their own lives. And also to tell somebody, "You are a bhoot, you're caught up like this," it's not proper. That shows you have no understanding how to deal with people.

Never say, "You have a bhoot," or anything. At the most you can say "this chakra is catching," if it is needed, but there is no need to tell that. Is, as we, you see, as we say that "If you become the king you have to wear the crown".

So if you become a Sahaja Yogi you have to wear this culture. You cannot be like bhoots, cannot be. Not that you have to be something different like Hare Rama, Hare Krishna. I am not saying this, but you have to be something special. And the speciality doesn't come by becoming punks or anything. Punks think they are very special people by making that kind of a hairstyle. Speciality is within yourself. It's a kind of a culture. So first of all, look after your ego.

Soul-searching has to be there. Because when I read Russian people, their books, I found out that every book, whether they describe romance, they describe anything, there is behind, is all soul-searching. They are trying to find out, "Why I am doing this? Why I am doing that? Why am I like this?" Soul-searching is there. So we should search our souls. So all the time say, "Why am I doing this? Why am I like this? What is the reason?" This is what has to be done. Then this ego will drop out. It's a funny thing because it's already grown so big, you see. So you push it down, it comes back up like a rubber, push it down, again with the slightest thing it comes up. Arrogance, talking loudly and misbehaving, all that, right Vishuddhi catches so badly. All right?

So now it is not in any way to correct you but to guide you. And not to feel bad and Center Heart or something catching there, nothing of the kind. It should, it should catch nowhere but it should correct you in the normal way.

Now the problem of Indians are different and I, when I deal with them, I talk to them. But at least they do not have cultural problem; that's one thing. Of course, I mean, if they come from stupid families, if they have come with nonsensical things, then it's all right. Normally ninety-nine percent, one percent could be bad, also, I am not saying they are not bad.

And everybody must work - not that three, four people are working. You must learn every day. You can learn so many things, and you are seekers. Not only that, but you are Sahaja Yogis. You have so much of dynamism. You can do such a lot.

So any idea about yourself - you are so great or something - should be given up because we are Sahaja Yogis. So we are already great. Those who are great are already great.

I mean, supposing somebody says You are Adi Shakti. Now, I don't think it's something great because I am that. So what? If I was not that I would have felt, but I am Adi Shakti. So what? If I am Adi Shakti why should I feel proud of it? Because it is just there. What to do? And whenever you are saying, "Jai" and all that, I feel you are saying somebody else's "Jai". Sometimes I am afraid I might start saying with you. It never goes into My head, and you know, I don't know how it goes into your head. I said perhaps the hole is too big, so nothing stays. But you see, that's what I am saying.

Now for you, if I am the model and if you understand Me, then you must understand My culture. How, like Mathias was surprised that they were putting some balm on My feet or something on My feet, and I said, "Now, put some towel because I don't want this sheet to be spoilt." I mean, this is very, nothing great to Me but he felt that I was extremely - what, humble or what. But what is there? A sheet will be spoiled in any case, whether they are My feet or anybody's feet. That's how it should be.

So culturally, though I mean, we are very rich, I have never realized how rich Indians are. Now I am realizing.

Now supposing somebody is leaving. A little pencil is left - so little, you see - in the house, but that belongs to somebody. That will be kept like a precious stone, you know. Till you meet that person and give that, everybody'll say, "Have you given that? Have you given that or not?" "Baba, that person has not come as yet. He's gone somewhere." As soon as he'll come, first thing we'll go with that pencil and he'll say, "What? This pencil you've brought for me?" He will feel so bad about it, but no, the pencil belongs to him, all right, keep it like a precious stone. I mean, they are poor people compared to you.

Even the servants don't do any thieving, nothing. These politicians must have picked up from somewhere. I don't know from where they, must be from Warren Hastings. But normally there is no thieving in the house. Everything is left open. Everything is there, no thieving.

Government is corrupt - there's all horrible things are corrupt, that's there - but as far as the society is concerned, we are very honest.

I wish Sharat Chandra was translated for you to understand this beauty of this culture. Lot of such good points of this culture. We had that, you have that thing of Shrikanth, film of "Shrikanth"?

Sahaja Yogi: I am not sure, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: English are coming. Ask them to bring it. It's one of the best films you will see.

Sahaja Yogi: They are Shri Mataji. They are already at the airport, Shri Mataji. The English, are arriving.

Shri Mataji: All right, next time.

Sahaja Yogi: They are coming over here.

Sahaja Yogi: Diwali, Diwali.

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.
