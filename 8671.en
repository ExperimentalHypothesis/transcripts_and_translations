1994-12-31 Shri Ganesha Puja Kalwe

Today I’m talking about Shri Ganesha. Now we’ll be parting we will be going to our own country and I must congratulate you the way you have come up to the expectations of Shri Ganesha. I'm very happy with you people. I wish Indians would learn a lesson from you that you are the people who don't have this tradition; you don't have Shri Ganesha established there. Still somehow you have come up to such a level that I feel very proud of you and all of them should learn a lesson from you.
They are going to the Western life, Western style, Western expression of the filth but you people have accepted it and have changed so much that they have to learn a lesson that's what I'm telling them. It’s a very good lesson for them. First you used to come and learned here what was Sahaja Yoga and was respect, what was respecting yourself but I’m very happy to see this time you all have been a ideal example of Sahaja yogis. You tolerated all kinds of inconveniences and you saw [INAUDIABLE ?] of fort of your spirit not of your body and the way you have been behaving I’m over satisfied. I hope you’ll really grow to your spiritual dimensions and try to bring forth in this dimension in other people of your nationality - very important. You see all the bad points of these people and you see where they are going. You are worried about it, you are thinking about it but we have to do something about it so that they take to a very harmonic, real righteous life no use talking and giving big sermons. I’m sure you can do that and you have done it. There are certain points about Sahaja Yoga that you have to understand the precise way of curing your self and curing others. I’m hoping to write a book on that, I hope so if it is finished that will be useful for you to help your self and help others physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.
The best part is that the way you have control your children and you have brought them to proper lives and you have saved them of this is really remarkable because in India we have given up all children. We have become extremely [INAUDABLE ?] because they have become very arrogant and [INAUDABLE ?]. And our love is so much for the children but we allow them to do what they like. But you people have really saved your children and they will thank you very much for this.
I would like to thank all of you for bring this good work for yourself or others and for your country and I’m sure it will be very successful in a very short time and it will become global understanding of Sahaja Yoga.
May God bless you!
