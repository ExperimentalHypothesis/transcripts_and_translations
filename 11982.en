Transcript and Translation Birthday Puja 1987-0321

Shri Mataji (in English): The way you have greeted Me today, it is beyond words to express the joy of a Mother. Today you have celebrated it in a Western way and I am very happy about it. All over the world, your brothers and sisters are celebrating My birthday. You all have to think about them.

Also, the way we are sitting on a chair, on a Puja day is a very novel thing. Something very new to us. But this I had to do many a time in other countries. So somehow, with this atmosphere, I am not missing them much. I thought they are sitting among you, expressing their love.

It is very hard to talk on your birthday to people who love you so much. That is such a rapport that One feels it is better to be quiet. To feel all the delicate, beautiful, silent expressions of love.

I do not know whether I should thank you for all this. Normally, that is done. But never a Mother has been so much felicitated. So I do not know what a Mother has to answer. All this love that is expressed here.

(In Hindi): You have greeted Me today, I greet you as well. All over the world, one does not know in how many places, your Mother’s birthday is being celebrated. About that, I have to say, they are also sitting among you here, giving their greetings.

In these seventeen years of working with Sahaja Yoga, if I observe around, then there are many things that appear quite miraculous. It almost feels like the whole life is a [kabas?]. I had decided from the start that some extraordinary work has to be done in this life. I had also made a lot of preparations for that. I had put in a lot of efforts and “tapasya” (penance).

But, My family had no idea about it. Somehow, discretely, in solitude, I used to meditate. And I used to think about humankind could be uplifted in a collective form.

When this work started, that it could spread with such force, I was not aware of that. But, this is a living action. And how and where living actions will flourish, one cannot anticipate it beforehand.

This work taking place in this collectivity did not emerge suddenly. Initially, there were very few people who got realisation. But when I look at the whole sequence from the start, I think that in these seventeen years, what we have we achieved in Sahaja Yoga?

The first thing that comes to My attention is that I had no idea about human nature. And when, through Sahaja Yoga, I became acquainted with human nature, I was very surprised to find that there was no “jagruti” (awakening) at all in man.

He does “dhyan” (meditation), does “dharana” (belief), talks about “Paramatma” (God Almighty), does all sorts of “pravachan” (sermon), does all the things. He calls himself a Guru and has thousands of disciples.

But in truth, he has no knowledge of Reality. And it was astounding, that man was trapped in a very thick fog of ignorance and was drifting who knows where.

But the other experience was that when a man is awakened ("jagruti") when his Spirit is awakened, it is only then that he undergoes a transformation. Before that, it is difficult for him to get transformed through any other thing.

There may be one or two, but I could not spot a single person in my sight. Only the Kundalini awakening has brought transformation within him. This means that without the awakening of the Spirit, the man was sitting in pitch darkness.

All these talks were mere talks. All this thinking was mere thinking. All this writing was mere writing. But the inference, the meaning, of all these was not there in their lives.

And the third experience was that even the people who received awakening – they also in some way or other, got ensnared by their old natures. And there could be a small thing responsible for that.

Just like, a gentleman came into Sahaja Yoga in London. He had a very beautiful vibrations. On seeing his "chaitanya" (vibrations), I said, " You must have performed something "sukhroop" (pleasant/joy-giving) in your previous life. And it is because of this “sukhroop” that you are filled with vibrations”.

That is it, no sooner it was said, his straight head turned. Instead of walking forwards he started walking backwards. I thought that with this praise, he would try to go forward and grow more. Instead of that, his head turned (with pride).

And looking at him, I was astounded. That suppose you give a man one “tola” (10 grams) of gold, he would try and make it two “tolas”. I had hoped for that. But it did not happen. The way you evolved from fish to tortoise, then something else, then something else.

And some experiences came such that whatever thing you give them - if you give them a material thing, which is just matter, only matter, they will take that same material thing and abuse it. They abuse it a lot. Just give them a small title, then they become Hitler.

If you talk to them with love and you trust them, then taking My very name, they descend into more viciousness. Taking revenge on people, troubling them, tormenting them – that is so much wickedness towards Me.

God Almighty is Love and Love is only God. Everything comes after Love. First and foremost, God has bestowed Love on this Universe. If He did not love, then this Universe would have never been made.

Then you talk about “Sat-Chit-Ananda” (Truth, Consciousness, Joy). But, the way Love cannot be defined, it cannot be described, its bliss cannot be described, in the same manner, it is not possible to describe God Almighty.

From the start, I have been talking about this great, pure Love. And throughout My life, I have only given you nothing but My Love. What else do I have to give? These are all the miracles of Love.

Love is the basis of everything. The one who has come into Sahaja Yoga but not learned to love, they have not understood Sahaja Yoga till now. The very first thing is, how many more people do we love.

Two to four "chamchas" (spoons - Hindi slang meaning sycophants/flunkeys), this is a very popular word these days. At first, I did not know what the word “chamcha” meant. After coming into Sahaja Yoga, I first found that they will start by flattering one another. And then forming a group, they rule over the others.

This behaviour towards Me is a very serious, dark mockery. This is actually the work of devils.

You only have the authority that I have loved you and you love the world. This is your authority. When “me and mine” are not going away, when "yours and mine" are still going on, then when will Sahaja Yoga come together?

In the world, there are so many living things apart from human beings. Does anyone say, "This is mine?". Trees give their fruit, rivers give water, clouds give rain and the whole Earth expresses her beauty to you. Does anyone withhold anything?

When you are flowing the in the living current of nature, then what is the point in remembering all the trivial and degrading things?

There is just torment on all sides. Just like a gentleman came and said, “ I get up at 4 am each morning, I do this, I do that. But this other man does not.” “Then leave that person. Why are you waking up your household at 4 am in the morning? Who said you have to get up at 4 am and meditate in Sahaja Yoga? No.”

Getting up at 4 am and shouting out to the world, “I am meditating”, that is trivial, is useless.

When you feel you want to meditate, then you get up and meditate.

Until your attention remains disturbed, unless and until your attention does not get immersed into God Almighty, then just by applying force, this “bull” will not walk. Until the time the “bullock” of attention becomes a “horse”, it is not going to run, it will walk at its own pace.

However, in order to correct this bullock, you have to light of the Spirit. You must bring this light of the Spirit into use. Then you cast this light of the Spirit upon others. Show them this light.

But when you are shining with the light of the Spirit, then people should feel, “Yes, this is one (special) human being”. One should stand in one’s own splendour. Stand in one’s joy and happiness.

Let someone defame you, let them say anything. As long as you know it is a falsehood, then what is the need to get upset with them? When we [inaudible]

someone, then know that is not possible you are Sahaja Yogis.

That direction should be there. To bring that direction, it is necessary that you yourself be a very principled Sahaja Yogi.

Everyone thinks that we are surrendered to Mother. “Mother, we have changed so much. We are surrendered to You.” Now, the talk of surrender has been there since the time of Muslims. Islam means surrender.

Now surrender is not required so much; now sense is. Now “bhakti” (devotion) is not required so much, now wisdom is. It is done, whatever was required last night is done. Now you have come upon the stage, all preparations are done.

Now you have to complete the whole play. But we are not yet able to understand where we now are in Sahaja Yoga.

First, you were the takers, now you are the givers. But if the giver is, like a colossal fool, still the taker, and acting the role of a taker - then who will regard him, and who will accept his Sahaja Yoga?

So, the joy in the one who gives, a feeling of dignity towards oneself, empathy towards others, alertness about the world, with a view on the Universe, moving to great heights. Until this is illuminated through our characters, through our characters, till then, no one will accept Me, nor will they accept you.

And by combining all of this, a two and a half letter word is formed which is called “prem” (Love). And you just try to love and see.

Your angry nature does not seem to leave. I have even heard that some Sahaja Yogis use abusive words. You just cannot utter unholy words. Every wrong word of yours will become a “amantra” (opposite of mantra).

Whatever unholy words are there in this world, you have been given the awakened mantras to eliminate them completely. But instead of awakening this power, you are destroying the very “mantra vidya” (knowledge of mantras), that has been given to you.

Such people are made impure by the use of “amantras”. Sahaja Yoga’s subtlety lies within and not without. But it does not mean that subtlety is only within and outside all gross. Not at all.

Lots of people say that our hearts are clean it is just anyway outside. With that how can the light within shine outside? Until a person's [inaudible]

is not clean, until his light is not visible outside, till then what is the use of having an inner light?

Losing the way. I have seen this happening a lot in Sahaja Yoga. That people lose their way. Going after money, after power, I think that “Where did they get their Spirit, that they get distracted by such trivial things?”.

I understand that there are a lot of forces that can distract you. But you have attained with you, the greatest shakti, that is not possible even after thousands of years of effort.

But there have also been experiences that have been so beautiful and [inaudible]

. There are some people in Sahaja Yoga who have been transformed so beautifully, their life has become so glorious, that looking at them it feels [inaudible].

This has never happened before with any incarnation. So many people, such beautiful people, such high people, such holy people, such people of greatness, such people of strength have not been in the fortune of any previous incarnation. They have been in my fortune. That satisfaction is indeed very great.

But sometimes, the thorns prick with the flowers. And that lingering pain remains. And one feels, say again and again that you should transform so that the thorns also start becoming as fragrant as the flowers.

There is one thing to be understood in all this. This whole world, all of nature, all [inaudible], the Universe, the galaxies, whatever has been created, they are all waiting for your transformation.

They are all watching, when this atmosphere is going to change and when we shower them with flowers. None of them will have any meaning if a man comes to Sahaja Yoga and still does not transform.

In My work of seventeen years, it may have happened that I sometimes shirked away from the thorns, sometimes I just closed My eyes or even sometimes told the thorns, “It is all right”. The one hope was that everyone can be transformed. Nothing is impossible.

That does not mean that Sahaja Yoga allows thorns to flourish or has a connection with them. Or it supports them. Never ever.

Such thorns will be uprooted and thrown away. And until they transform they cannot return to be [inaudible]. This is destiny. I cannot change it, and neither can you change it.

This cycle is such that, you all should try to seek to transform yourself in this cycle. Ego comes in way of the smallest things. Like, “I will perform the aarti”. “Why? Why do you want to perform the aarti?”. “I will wash the Feet. I will do puja."

Until this “me, me” keeps coming in the way, Sahaja Yoga will start moving away.

Whenever any action, desire or intellect reminds you of “I”, then in such actions, there is no Sahaja Yoga. There is no place for Sahaja Yoga in such intellect. It means that you have not understood Sahaja Yoga emotionally. You have also not understood Sahaja Yoga with your intellect.

This “I” has to be left aside. And in some people, there is nothing except this “me”. And in the intoxication of this “me”, the “me” intoxication, that when you speak to me in this condition, even I cannot hear you. Neither can I understand you what you are saying.

Sometimes I feel l am listening to a barking dog. Or sometimes, as if a snake is hissing. What language are you speaking? This is not my language. Neither is it the language of man.

In this, there is none of the honour of love. There is no comfort of love, no whiff even, of love. What is the use of such acts?

There is electricity to do the work. The sound is there to do the work. “Omkar” (the primordial sound) is verily standing by, there is no need for anyone to do the work. But for that “Omkar” sound to come from within you, you have to be the instrument from which this sound emanates.

But what is the benefit of sitting in the darkness? With my unspoken love, I ask you, are you not lost in that darkness? Fed up of it?

And when I see among the people, some of the great expressions that have come from Sahaja Yoga, I say, this much has never happened in the past. And the day is not far when Sahaja Yoga will reach the heights of its glory. The day when Sahaja Yogis will be found everywhere in the world. I have no doubt of that now.

But the thought comes of those who I have put so much work in. They have not understood My Love. And those who cannot understand Me, how can they understand Sahaja Yoga?

Your love brings tears in My eyes. And the throat also chokes up, wondering what to say and what not to say.

This is all the “leela” (play) of Shri Krishna who spoke of nothing but sweetness. He organised Holi so that all the worldly arguments get mixed with colours from the left, colours from the right. Better to get away from all the problems of the world and play with colours.

But play with colours, at least. Not with mud, dirt and dung that you fling on others. But man does exactly that. Without that he does not have fun.

I do not know, but it is possible that some people have actually come to Sahaja Yoga so that they can fulfil their old desires and wishes. It is possible. I have this suspicion sometimes.

But what was told you in many lifetimes - that you attain yourself and all the bliss of your Spirit will be manifested in you. And you will become a great Spirit, become a great ideal, become an ocean of Love. Those promises which were made to you, Sahaja Yoga has come into this world to fulfil them.

And now if you want to lose it with your stupidity, then a Mother can only tell you, “Son, you have not understood.” When you have to drink water, you have to do it with love, how can you drink by scorning it.

Perhaps My words are not adequate to make you understand. Perhaps I cannot reveal My Heart to you. Perhaps you do not understand the tumult within Me. I have no complaints with you about that.

My only complaint is that you see the tumult within you, the gravity within you, the glory within you, the wealth you have. Enjoy that. Get immersed in that.

Today My birthday was celebrated. There is no meaning to My birthday. The birth took place, so what is special about that? And so what if the birthday came around? That way, every day it is someone's birthday. Everyday someone is born. And every day someone dies. This is a cycle of change. Every second. There is nothing special about it as much.

But it is special if the atmosphere comes to a standstill. It stands still. It freezes in that moment of time [inaudible].

Today on the occasion of My birthday, you have given Me a cake. There is love, adoration and affection in it. Give the same love, the same affection to everyone.

Today, you decide to stand still at this pinnacle of love.

That only is your goal, your destination. That you become Love, you are Love and nothing else, then know that you have reached your goal.

And nothing else is there to attain. All the work that you have done, all the arrangements, have decorated everything, everything is so beautiful, and all are at attention in the Puja today. At this time, you should stay at this point and say, “Mother, let us drown completely in this ocean of Love and be washed. All our degradations, our pettiness, our limitations we overcome all of them and we cross(?) over. We come to the [inaudible], these desires may be fulfilled today, this very second”.

You know I do not have any desires. And because I do not desire, no desire gets fulfilled. I am moving forward only on the support of your desires. That is why your desire will take you across.

This is not a wish. Otherwise, like other desires, this will also go waste. But this is the awakening of pure desire. This pure desire should be awakened means, you have to bring it into “kriya”, action.

Today before leaving, all of you must meet one another with love. Talk to each other, get acquainted with one another. It is not that Bombay people are separate, Delhi separate, Pune separate, those from Madras are separate. Forget all that.

It is all a mirage, a falsehood. It does not exist. It is just futile chatter. Keep it aside and meet one another and talk to each other with love.

Conquer with love. I do not have any other hope. I am living solely on this hope that Love grows and the light of the Spirit spreads all over the world.

All the catastrophes in the world and stupidity and the way the world is tethering today between sorrow and regret, a firm thing needs to be placed in front of that.

No one should think less of yourself. All are worthy of My respect and love. That is why, each and every person, keeping faith in yourself and your glory, love yourself and learn to love others. The man who cannot love himself cannot love any others.

With the light and glory of the Self that is within, you look at the beautiful form of others and [inaudible]. You keep drowning more and more in this deep ocean of Love, that is my blessing to all of you.

[Mother now speaks in Marathi].

And it is my request to everyone to at least learn our national language (Hindi). And there is a collectivity in that language. Of course, there is no language as spiritual as Marathi prevailing today. Even then the national language should be learnt.

Because we have our brethren from Tamil Nadu, the Bengali speakers, and people from other countries, their thoughts can first be brought into the Hindi language. They cannot go to the English language. Because there is a very big difference between our culture and the English culture. Therefore it will first have to be expressed in Hindi.

Regardless of what our mother tongue is, whatever it may be, even so, Hindi language should be learnt. Then from that, you can learn Sanskrit or anything else. But the first Hindi should be learnt. All the foreigners are now learning Hindi. And they are asking Me, "Mataji, these people do not know Hindi. Marathi people do not know Hindi. Then how to talk to them?". Does that mean they have to learn fourteen languages?

Now ours is a global work. Now the national language is itself in tatters. They themselves have done it. At least in Maharashtra, we should adorn it. I am not saying this for national pride. But I do not see any other way.

Without the Hindi language, how can we spread this culture all over the world? For one, we will have to tell everyone to learn the Marathi language. That is not going to be possible. At least learn the Hindi language. It is not difficult for Maharashtrians to learn Hindi. It will be better if they learn it.

I speak in Marathi when I am touring Maharashtra. It is very conducive for spirituality. Even so, in keeping with the times, if everyone can know Hindi, the work will be done very easily. By doing that the importance of the Hindi people (from the northern states) is not going to increase.

All said and done, I think there are at least five more years before Sahaja Yoga spreads to the North. It is still in Delhi. Going further north in India beyond that is difficult work. Going to Bihar, that is even more difficult work.

So there is no connection between language and Sahaja Yoga. There should be no thought that if we start work in Hindi, the Hindi people will start their rule in Sahaja Yoga. There is no such kingdom in Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is the kingdom of Love.

But a language is needed for conversations with one another. Now we have the Italians and speakers of fourteen other languages. Now I cannot ask them to learn our fourteen languages or we learn fourteen (foreign) languages.

Now everyone finds the Marathi language is hard. This is not the Ganga (river). Beyond the Ganges, it is the Bhagirathi (river). Even beyond that is the Alakhnanda (river). And it is a difficult task to reach up to that point. That should be understood. The first step into the Ganges and then into the Alakhnanda. This is an ancient language. So, “everyone should know this language, we will speak only in Marathi”, these demands should not be made.

Hindi should be learnt, and my speeches should be in Hindi so that everyone can understand. So try to learn Hindi.

(In English): I told everyone else to speak in the Hindi language. Because I have already told you that by not having the Hindi language in this country, all of us have separated from each other. Sharat Chandra, I read in Hindi; Bakim Babu I read in Hindi; I read Bharathi in Hindi. I read all the great poets in the Hindi language. If I had not known Hindi, I would not have read Bharathi. I read Kavi Kurup in the Hindi language.

Because you cannot translate them in English. In the English language - is a hopeless language for our culture. For our spiritual culture. Must understand, this difficulty is there.

So you should not be against Hindi or anything. Because these Hindi people cannot become Sahaja Yogis, you must understand, they have to learn a lot. They do not even know what is Dattatreya. It will take time.

And who is going to rule in Sahaja Yoga except for your Mother’s Heart? So we should have no worry on this part. Let us learn Hindi just because it is convenient.

And foreigners ask Me what language should they learn? Should they learn fourteen languages Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali, Hindi? As it is there are fourteen languages there. What language should they teach their children? So let us have at least Hindi language as our language of communication. So I hope you will spread in that.

Second point is that this is the year of shelter. So, to celebrate My birthday, if possible, try to make some shelter for some poor man any way you feel. One person. So you give some money, one person somewhere.

I also will take My house as a shelter for the whole world this year. So I request you to celebrate this year – to be able to be alert to what is happening around you. Try to get some money, pull out some money to one of the Sahaja Yogis who needs it.

That does not mean you ask them to come into your house. If he needs money for the repairs of his house. If he is very poor you can help him.

Another shelter is a tree. So we should all plant trees also as a matter of shelter.

Sahaja Yogi cannot live outside the sea. He is a part and parcel of the sea. So he has to be alert about what is happening in the whole world, what is happening in this country, what we are supposed to do for society. Because we are "samuhik" (collective).

These are small things by which we express our love. Everything is with love if you know how to give it. If you know how to keep it, then you do not know how to give it.

So one should not be angry when I say we have to learn Hindi. It is a very practical thing I am telling you. I myself am a Maharashtrian, why not have Marathi. If I say so, maybe after a hundred years we will find everyone speaking “Bambaiya Marathi” - which is a horrible language (a street version of Marathi unique to Mumbai).

That is what I told them. We want them to know a language in which we can have a rapport.

May God Bless You.

[Applause].
