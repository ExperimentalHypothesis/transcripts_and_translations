Shivaratri Puja, Pune, India, 5 March 2000.

First, I’ll speak in English language, because we have so many people from foreign countries, and especially from Madras (Chennai) and also from Kerala, Hyderabad and Bangalore. All these people have come here, and I don’t know what other people are here, who have come from South and who do not yet understand Hindi language.This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think, because there is so much – if you read any newspaper in the morning, such horrible news is there about the people who are trying to create all kinds of violence, corruption and immoral behaviour. You are surprised how, these days, it is so full of all these criminalities going round us.This is the time, as if come, for the "Taandav nrtya" [ताण्डव नृत्य, cosmic dance] of Shri Shiva. Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve. It is His anger, if it starts, throwing wrath on people of this character and this type. I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath. He’s a God who is full of love, full of tremendous compassion, but also the- another extreme of very destroying character. He can destroy the whole world. He can finish all the creatures that have been created if He gets into a temper.

You all must be knowing the story, how He went into ecstasy. There was a devil who had taken a form of a child. And a mother cannot kill the child, she cannot. And She thought She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath or anger of Shiva if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.So She withdrew from Her act of sacrificing the child or killing the child and it was Shiva who took over. And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him. That child was a devil. And so, He saved the world from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa. And then He danced with joy. That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.Many people don’t understand why He’s standing on top of a little child, but the reason was this. So, even people may camouflage today as small children, as very innocent people, as very holy gurus, Shiva can destroy all of them.

This destruction has already started and is going with a full speed, I think, all over, through so many things that are happening: we have got hurricanes, storms, earthquakes, many accidents, and so many destructive things are working out which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation. But, at the same time, there is another work going on, of the same incarnation: is the resurrection of the people. Such people can never be hurt, nothing can happen to them. They’ll be always saved. Everything will be saved for them because they are under the protection of their Mother.Now the problem is how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution? Only solution is raising the Kundalini. If you raise the Kundalini of human beings, who are even very bad and gone cases, either they will be destroyed or they will be saved and they’ll become good people. They will stop all this horrible things they are thinking and planning in their heads and they’ll become really very, very good people. It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case. But if Sahaja Yogis meditate and keep themselves in complete peace and also completely surrendered, nothing can happen to them. They are always protected and you all have an experience of that protection. But first you should have faith in yourself and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think, because there is so much - if you read any newspaper in the morning - such horrible news is there about the people who are trying to create all kinds of violence, corruption and immoral behaviour. You are surprised how, these day

We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here, mostly from North, South, East and West of India, and also from other foreign countries. Every country is, today, under the control of these negative forces. What we have to do is to make people positive through Kundalini awakening. This you all can do. This you can achieve.

For this, you don’t have to do something special. In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it. This is the only thing that is needed today, is to transform people and you all can do it, all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner. You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people, get angry with rude people, but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it; so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva, as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open. That’s something horrible. We all can do it in a very constructive manner, extremely in a constructive manner. So what we should do is to, first of all, establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy, principle of love and principle of Truth, I should say.

There are big problems, also, because people have no idea as to Shiva’s global temperament. For example, I have heard people quarrelling and fighting over Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there for you to rise up to this Shiva principle. Both are not different, one is supplementary for another. But if you go on fighting even on that point, I can’t understand. You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu. And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle, if you have not understood the Vishnu principle – Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi. She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva. And She rises through the channel that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process. So how can you do away with one of Them? One is the road, another is the destination. So I hope you understand how important it is that your centers should be corrected, your road should be alright, that your Sushumna should be cleared, because we are “madhyamargis”: we have to go by the centre, by the central path and we have to have the balance – not to go to the left and not to go to the right. This balance we must keep and go on moving until you reach your "talu bhaag" [Brahmarandhra] where sits Sadashiva.

You can experience it, you can see for yourself. Whatever I am saying, you know it very well. Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify. Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily, and you know that, that you now know the only truth. The truth which is absolute.This is also the principle which starts showing results when these two powers meet. It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet, or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle, then you realize that these two powers are so complimentary and so much related to each other. There’s no difference, in a way, between these two powers. And, so, keep your road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean and let the Kundalini pass through it. When the Kundalini will pass through it, you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini is going through the Vishnu path and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.

Translation from Hindi:

All of you recognise Shri Shiva, and a lot of pujas and acts of worship are performed.  But you do not know the different aspects of His virtues and qualities.  That is why sometimes you commit mistakes and omissions.  The most important aspect of Shri Shiva is bliss and joy.  And this joy surrounds Him in subtle and subtlest forms.  And until you become spiritually subtle, you will not be able to recognise these various forms of joy, nor will you be able to experience them.  He is ensconced in every particle of every thing.  Wherever He exists, He creates .. what shall I say.. He creates an atmosphere of joy and bliss in His surroundings.  And when you move around in that environment you find that you have been transformed into something else. You become different from the usual type of person, and find happiness in different things.

For instance some people find happiness in destroying themselves, and taking this into wrong paths, and doing things which are against the spirit.  And they feel they can find happiness in that kind of activity.

But the Atma, which is verily Shri Shiva, finds joy in a different way.  And only that can touch our heart.  Like there are a lot of people who are immersed in material things.  Some imbibe alcohol; others indulge into sinful activities, and they feel that there is a lot of happiness in that.  But it is not.  Slowly slowly they get destroyed.  And slowly, slowly they are finished.

But Shiva conciliates us.  He gives us peace, and He gives us joy.  And when the Shakti of Shiva – Kundalini, and the Shakti of Vishnu – the Sushumna Nadi combine, then you can feel the truth.  Only the truth.  The truth that no one can deny or refuse to accept.  Because it is the pure, unqualified truth.  Which you can feel on your fingertips.  You will have innumerable experiences which will prove to you that this is the perfect truth, in which there is no an iota of doubt.  That truth dawns on you spiritually.  You can know it; you can comprehend it.  And this is the gift bestowed by Kundalini.

This means that the Kundalini, which is the Shakti of Shiva, when She rises through the central channel, She awakens all the chakras, aligns them in its entirety, assembles, and unites.  Who did it, and who looks after that Shakti.  We can say that Shri Vishnu is the one who looks after Her, because She moves in the central path, which is the territory of Shri Vishnu.  And then She reaches the Brahmarandhra, and manifests.  And we can understand that now Her journey is complete.  So we can see how much cooperation,  and mutual support was there.

But we people have contracted a new type of disease,  of materialism.  Running after money has become a very strange disease.  And for that we are willing to go to any lengths to support this new craze.  The reason for this is that some sort of defect has crept into us.  A lot of bad tendencies have accumulated inside us.  And the cleansing of these evil tendencies can only be done by Kundalini.  But if you do not fully absorb and assimilate this Kuindalini shakti, if you do  not nourish it with meditation and attention,  so that it is firmly stabilised, then you cannot reach that state where the manifesting of truth takes place, and gives you the state of peace and joy.  A kind of incomplete state, and shortfall, happens.

When the Kundalini rises, She cleans everything in Her path.  With the energy of Shiva, everything gets cleansed and purified.  But still some people are trapped, and afflicted with their old bad habits and wrong ways;  and with the slightest temptation or opportunity, they fall from their ascent.  If there exists within us even an atom of vice or immorality, we can fall and get completely destroyed.

Those who come to the Pujas; those who meditate and cleanse, always make great progress.  If there is no peace, even trees cannot be saved.  Even germination cannot take place.  That is why, if you do not have a meditative quality, if you do not have high ideals that I will not be influenced by any temptations or allurements, I will not succumb to any bad habits, you should try to attend all the pujas and sit in meditation more often.  Because you are now authorised to do puja.  Everyone doesn’t have the right to do Pujas, but every second person goes and does pujas.  But when they have no connection how can you be authorised to do a puja.

But many people feel that they should go to this temple or that temple; go to this guru or that guru.  Nothing will happen with that.  You are your own guru, and only you can introspect and find out the defects that are inside you.  Have I recognised and accepted Sahaja Yoga fully from my heart, or not.

I have seen a lot of people come into Sahaja Yoga and after reaching a certain height, they fall. The faster and higher they rise, the deeper they seem to fall.  The reason is that small small hidden tendencies have become active and they were not aware of it.  That is why you must keep your attention towards yourself, and see where you are getting ensnared in wrong traps.  Am I doing any wrong things which are a-Sahaj (against Sahaj).  Or, are any wrong and sinful ideas coming into my mind.  Have I come into Sahaj with the idea of making money.  Or are my motives very bad and evil.  Our attention should be towards discovering these wrong tendencies.

The best thing to do is to get involved in all the Sahaj programs and activities; attend all meditation and clearing sessions, and make ourselves strong and firmly established in Sahaja Yoga.  We should strive to achieve a high quality, individually and collectively.  If you establish yourself in the Self, then you can become a collective person.  Those who cannot be collective, they cannot also grow individually.  This I have seen.  Those who become collective, they only can grow.

Maybe some things improve for the individual, like you might get money; or name, or fame.  Some people come with the ambition to control people.  How many people they can influence or control.  That also happens.  But your personal growth does not happen.  There will not be any depth or gravity in your growth.  You are not a Sahaja Yogi of high quality.  Till you achieve that quality, all your efforts are in vain.  You are not a Sahaja Yogi of high quality.  Till that time all your talking and actions are useless.  Because, don’t know when you will fall.  Everyone knows that you will face total destruction.

That is why we should be cautious and try to achieve spiritual heights.  There is one more thing you should do.  That after you have got your realisation, you should give realisation to thousands more.  In that way your powers will increase.  If not, whatever little you have achieved, will all be lost.  This is a very unusual rule.  It cannot be compared with anything else.  Like if one lamp enlightens another lamp, the first lamp does not become brighter.  This does not happen.

But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, that if anyone opens his heart and sincerely spreads Sahaja Yoga, and gives realisation to others, he shines.  Because you have been made a Sahaja Yogi for the sole purpose that you pass on the enlightenment to others, and bring about a transformation in the world.  That you create a great wave of transformation and make the world a beautiful place.  A very new and special world. This should be your pure desire.

The Kundalini becomes energised and activated.  Even normal, simple people, when they narrate their experiences, it is amazing that how did this idea come into their minds.  What made them do this, or say this

There are some people who come into Sahaja Yoga for power and control.  Some come for money.  All these desires do not help a person to grow spiritually.  There is no glow in their personality.  Because the light that you have received; if you do not share it with others and if you do not nourish it within yourself, no efforts will have any success.  Which is to say that our only work is to change the world; to transform the world.  We have to build a special world and you are special people.  When you begin to understand your importance, and how special you are, then you will make your life beautiful and peaceful.

[Talk continues in Marathi]

Translation
from Marathi:

Have spoken in English, Hindi and now shall speak in Marathi. There are so many Maharashtrian’s here that it is apt that I should speak in Marathi. It is My wish that all the Sahaja Yogis who live in Maharashtra should learn the Hindi language as it is our National language. We should love and be ready to sacrifice anything for our Nation. This was the speciality of Maharashtra.

Now the Maharashtra state, which I see, I don’t know where those people have gone. They took to the Gods and started doing their puja. After this was done and didn’t work out, then used another way; they have started going to this guru, that guru, then going to temples and all. We should see what these people have achieved by doing this and what you have achieved by doing Sahaja Yoga. So now just leave and forget everything and sincerely think about ourselves and keep your Kundalini in such a way that you can help and contribute to the great work of Sahaja Yoga.

I am Maharashtrian by birth, was amazed to see how Sahaja Yoga has spread in North of India. Have hardly made any effort to spread Sahaja Yoga, but it has spread like fire in north India, which is very surprising. It is very sad and has failed to understand as to why it has not worked out in Maharashtra, as it should have been.

Sahaja Yoga has spread in all big and small villages of Maharashtra. One day a man had come to work at My Place. He touched My feet so I asked him, “What happened?” He told Me that Mataji Your photo is in every big and small village of our district, Your disciples are in every village. All of them say that we are Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell us anything about stupid practices. I was wondering how this has happened, because of whose blessings as I was thinking nothing would work in this country as too many people are ill-affected.

People are sitting in Maharashtra who are so deep-rooted, the knowledge they have about everything is so deep-rooted, but I don’t know where it has gone. Have always said that all Sahaja Yogis should always be together, be in collective and should give Realization to thousands of people. Every morning you should only think, ‘how many people did we give Realization to, how many people’s Kundalini, is awakened by us!’

You have a job to save the whole world, as the Kundalini of the world is sitting in Maharashtra i.e. we have ‘Ashta Vinayak’ (eight Ganeshas) in Maharashtra, and three and a half Goddesses sitting in Maharashtra. All the arrangements are done but, surprisingly, people do not understand it. People are so much pretentious and waste time doing false things. Instead of doing this, try to achieve the truth. Watch and follow the truth. It will be your wealth, if you change from, within. This wealth should grow and mature so much that its fragrance should spread in the whole world.

We get involved in petty things and fight among ourselves. We should stop fighting amongst ourselves, for petty things. I am watching Yuva Shakti and their activities. It looks like due to them the whole of Maharashtra is changing. People who are sitting in high positions are very arrogant, have failed to understand the reason for their arrogance. Due to this very attitude, we were not able to do something special in Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra. So it should be your motto, to spread Sahaja Yoga.

Today is a very special day - Shivratri. We should all take a pledge and pray to Shiva and get His blessings, by getting which, you would feel, the flow of happiness and love in your heart. First of all, you have to be deep-rooted in Sahaja Yoga. The light which we have in our hearts, if we don’t spread it then we will be in darkness, along with others. So we should decide and give Realization to a minimum of 100 people, till next year. We need to understand that, if we go and speak to people about Sahaja Yoga, many over smart people may not agree to the teachings of Sahaja Yoga. If you explain to people the benefits and your experiences of practising Sahaja Yoga, especially what you have achieved, then people may start believing you and mend their wrong ways.

This is our main responsibility, for this, you have to come forward and spread Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra. If this change does not happen then I am not sure in what condition this state will be in? While taking a lot of pain, Shivaji Maharaj has done a lot for this state. There have been many saints in Maharashtra, the numbers not seen in any state or any country, who have shed their blood for this place, such a blessed place! It is rightly called Maharashtra (Maha means great & Rashtra means State) and see the dilemma that you fight for petty things, in this blessed place. Kindly note that you people are Realized, souls. Earlier there were no Realized souls, but there were Malva's (foot soldiers) of Shivaji Maharaj. Fail to understand, where these people have gone, the people from the royal community, who never used to touch drinks or had any vices, these same people are now drinking and behaving senselessly and by doing this you are going away from Shiva.

That is why old people have said that God has taken lots of efforts, but if you are facing in the wrong direction then how it will work out? You should explain it to people from all your heart, and this is what I have been telling you, in this Shiva puja. If Shiva gets angry then Maharashtra state will be the 1st one to get destroyed, as this is a special place for Shiva. You know how much you believe in Shiva and Shri Ganesh is the main Deity to all of us and if He gets angry then I am not sure what will happen.

Don’t know when all this started happening in Maharashtra, am seeing what people are doing with Shri Ganesh’s idol. If you people disrespect Lord Ganesha then, who is going to save you from His wrath. So you need to tell the whole world that they should join Sahaja Yoga, to get their Kundalini awakened.

Everybody is aware of Kundalini right from Marchrindra Nath to Gorakh Nath, as all these people have worked on Kundalini, there are books on Kundalini, but the knowledge has remained within the books, it has not spread out to other people. You should tell people about Sahaja Yoga and the rising of the Kundalini.

On this auspicious occasion of Shivratri, we should all decide that we will spread Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra and work hard on it. This is the only job we should do and then see how your other jobs are done, unbelievably! We should meditate if we don't meditate what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga. There is no meaning if you just come here dance and sing and don’t meditate. The main thing is you should feel this change within you, this change in your personality will make you will feel so happy and proud of yourself. This work of Sahaja Yoga should be done by you. On this occasion on Shivaratri, if you want to make Shiva happy, give Realization to a lot of people, spread Sahaja Yoga. Kundalini is His Shakti.

Instead of wasting time on unimportant things, give Realization to people, awaken their Kundalini. By doing this, you will change the whole of Maharashtra. There are few people who are creating problems, but they will perish. First of all, you should awaken the Kundalini of others, giving them Realization, is your duty. On this Shivratri when we are doing Shiva puja, think of Shiva in your heart, so that there will never be heart-related problems.

You have to keep, Shiva in your heart so that when you are getting Realization and your Kundalini is getting awakened, the changes that are happening internally, is happening because of the light you are getting from Shiva, the Spirit – Atma. He is the Spirit – Atma and He is reflected within us, in our heart. So watch yourself in that reflection. Why are you lying and making a fool of yourself? Have tried explaining this to people, they just don’t understand. Only attending lectures won’t help. If you want to help yourself, you should follow and spread Sahaja Yoga with full dedication. This is My request to all Sahaja Yogis, a request with all My love to spread and follow Sahaja Yoga.

May God bless you.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
