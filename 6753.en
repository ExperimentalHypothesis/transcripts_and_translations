The other day I talked to you about the left side power that we have by which we desire. In Sahaja Yoga language we call it as Mahakali power. And this power gives us the left side which is our subconscious. And the subconscious it gives us the conditioning. Through our subconscious only we become conditioned. Now how does our subconscious takes the conditioning? In between the thought there’s a very little space which we can call as the silence, as the present. But the thought that comes to you rises and falls off, stops for a while and again another thought starts and falls off. The first thought that rises, we can see the rising of the thought, not the falling of it. And when it falls it goes into the subconscious. Another one also rises. It rises and again it falls; it goes into the subconscious. That’s how our subconscious starts building up. How do the thoughts come into us? Thought comes to us because human beings when they look at a thing they have a method of projecting their mind into it. 


If you have got a blackboard I can tell you how it happens. Can you close it? Ha, wipe it out. I wanted to talk about this subject but, you see, it’s rather complicated. But we have to somehow or other face it sometimes in life. This is the brain of a [human being]. This is [unclear]. It’s such as a very [unclear], you see, then goes up into a flat surface, then will go on rising like that till it becomes this [part] of the head which is the area of the brain. After brain these things start, and they go on rising. All right. So what happens? The energy that falls out of it ? in the very childhood one has a very long type of head. Look how this [head it] is. The child is in the fetus stage, in the fetus stage. It’s like that, after the second month or so.  There, the energy is coiled in three parts, one like that, one like that. This is one energy, that is Brahmashakti. One energy. Because there are three parts it gets divided into three [channels]. So there’s not [unclear] we’ll talk about this. This when it comes here it passes through, we can say, two [residences; GW: hemispheres?], because yogis have two matters divided [matter] of brain into two [residences; GW: hemispheres?],] and that’s why [I decided] who is a [unclear]. So because of his different residence [GW: hemisphere?] it goes into a, it’s like that. Then this one also goes into a [unclear]. Then my head is so heavy and I have [no place to have in] something.


Now, this thing has to, now, has to go into the venter abdomen, means the spinal chord, all right? This is here, something like that. So it has to divert itself. When it goes like that, there, I don’t know if you know the principle of parallel [unclear] forces. [unclear] [working through] a [component] disposed like that, I mean spiritual. So even one [component] going down like that and the one going like that. In the same way it happens to this one also at this point, we can say. So we have the attentions of [anybody else] are going out. Now this one that is going down is waking up our sympathetic nervous system. And these ones are going down and these ones are going out, [takes up] our attention which goes to things. Now it falls [supposing] onto a [thing], any, any like that, this reacts on it. You see, this attention doesn’t know what to do. It goes and gets involved into it, carrying [this], like English going to India to dominate. That’s how we must [tense up]. And when, when it is stored into it, like that, you see how the two systems [turn on, develop]. This is the subconscious. This is supraconscious. This is the superego. This is supraego. 


Now, to take this attention inside is the problem. This attention has to go to the, to the Spirit. It’s not sort of reacting they have. But this attention has to go to the Spirit. When the subconscious acts, for example, I put My, say, attention onto this chair. All right? So now, if I’m not attached to it I see it just as a play. After realization I can see it. But before realization to me, this is a precious thing. This is my possession, this is my home and this one is an emblem of some sort of my residence, whatever it is. All these ideas come to my head. Then I get involved into this one. Then this becomes a conditioning factor. Supposing something happens to this chair, then I’m [finished]. I can even become mad. I can go to the [mad house]. That [may happen]. People do. I mean, for something material they can go into madness. But this has nothing to do with you, see it’s nothing, it’s outside, is outside, it is not inside. Here we are. So they divide these methods, these are make-beliefs, really make-beliefs. And the subconscious gives us a make-belief. But once I have heard, today we had this laughing and this on and say that I believe, of course I believe. I say it, all right, I say it. What, what is it? I believe in God. So, are you obliging God or yourself? It’s difficult for us to understand that [whether] believing or not believing God exists, whether you like it or not. He exists. But then the projections start moving in such a way that we start even [bonding] Him according to our conditionings.


For example to an Indian, God must have [red]. For an Englishman the God must have, I shouldn’t say, but a cigar. For the Buddhists this God must have long ears hanging to Him, imagine. Or say to a Greek, God must have moustaches. [So it’s like that], all the time. So that God has to conform to all the ideas of human beings, all right? Now, He is to be born somewhere, poor thing. He has to be born. So how to be reborn then? I mean, it is too much to say about God like that. He’s the One who has created this Universe. In that huge thing they have not even respect. And we are deciding about Him everything. It’s rather mysterious, isn’t it? How can an ant decide about Caxton Hall saying that, “Oh, this hall should not have been there”? This is nothing relatively; it’s much more, much, much, much more. But this is what happens to us because our attention is just [that we are]. This has also given us the freedom to be ourselves, in the sense ourselves, means I, I-ness, “I am such so and so,” comes to us because the rising of ego and superego is there, catch you out, completely drop the All-pervading Power and you become an egg shell. You become an egg. And the shell one side is the ego; another side is the superego. 


Now pertaining to all our seeking also we use the same method that “I think”. First starts with “I think”, you see. Whatever you think is not God. Because if you could think then He is not God. This is the absolute logic. He is too great that you could think about Him. You can only become one with It. It would be like a little bird trying to fathom the ocean. Now when we start our seeking we come here with our conditionings. And the subconscious – today I’m talking about subconscious, not so much of ego but of subconscious because I started talking on subconscious ? is still there. And the worst part of the subconscious is, the worst of all, you see, that if the personality is ego-oriented then for him the subconscious is the most important. Such a person becomes a very obstinate seeker, very obstinate. He may start judging a person according to one subconscious. For example ,“I don’t like.” And we become judgmental, you see. “I don’t like such a person.” Now, “Why?” “Oh, I just don’t like.” Then the ego comes in, to explain. It’s saying, “Oh, must be something wrong with that person which I have felt through my Spirit.” I mean, Spirit you have not reached as yet. No, not yet. We must accept. Sahaja Yoga is not a make-belief. It is absolutely down-to-earth truth. You cannot believe that, “Oh, I am spiritually all right. Yes, yes, I’ve got it. I’ve felt very much better.” “I felt very much better” is not the way to look at, at your seeking. And when the ego becomes in charge of that subconscious, then seeking is very difficult, because ego starts deciding everything. You start judging everything with ego, and the subconscious is such a dubious thing, very dubious. Now, I would say Freud did work on the subconscious area. He did work on the subconscious. 


Yes, do you want something? Yes. It’s all right? All right. 


It is a very dubious thing within us. Say, somebody’s mother has got green eyes. The boy will be fascinated by green eyes. Supposing the mother is modern and has got a bald head but uses, say, a wig, all right? And if she doesn’t change her wig much then he may like a particular type of a wig.  But if she, say, changes too much he may like a bald-headed woman. Can’t say. So the subconscious works out with such transitory things that to get it fixed also is a difficult thing and when it is fixed, to remove  it is  even more difficult. 


Some people become routineous in their nature, absolutely routineous. They walk like blind. They get up early in the morning. They take their tea. The newspaper has to be there. If newspaper is not there they cannot do anything the whole day. Newspaper they must read. I mean, it’s good that we don’t read newspapers. But he can’t live without it. So he must have this newspaper before him. He takes his newspaper and the counted number of sips he’ll take of the tea. Then he will go into the bathroom with counted number of steps, will take the bath, the same way, absolutely the nail cutter here, this there, there, there. He just walks like this, on. Absolutely joyless, lifeless life he leads. It’s a routine. Another person is the [opposite] way. Both the extremes come from our subconscious. If person is very routineous and meticulous he could be a very bad headache. He’s a very unpopular person. He gives us a headache because he is used to a meticulous thing. He makes everybody meticulous. He wants everybody to be meticulous. If somebody is not meticulous then he gets after the life of that person, and I’ve seen some people if there’s, say, such a person coming in the morning they run away and have a bath in India. 


Miserliness also come from such habits. All such headaches come from subconscious. But to them, because they have their ego, they say, “No, I’m not miserly. I’m economical.” Ego finds out words, you see, to make something ugly look very nice. And this is how we start of looking after our subconscious and nourishing it. Nicely it’s coming up. We do not want to face ourselves. Even before realization we can face ourselves. “Then why are we so abnormal? Why anyone would calls me a bore? No one likes my company. I have to assert myself too much to be in the company of others. There is no magnetism left in me. What’s the matter? Why? Why that people do not want me? Why they want to get rid of me?” But ego is something, “Oh, very useless. They are good for nothing. I am such a higher personality. I am such and such. I am a person of taste, I’m this. I’m that.” And such people can end up with dogs or maybe some cats, I don’t know. There are some of them end up with even snakes. Not with human beings. 


The subconscious has so many problems which Freud has brought forward and said that, “This is the subconscious, subconscious.” But he was such a limited man and a half-baked person that he himself suffered from all the patients who came to him and he got all their diseases. Really, he became a case of complete materia medica. So whatever he has said has definitely helped us to see how many varieties of subconscious attacks we can have. But at the same time he has given us no solutions and he has made us very one-sided that is do not allow yourself to be conditioned. Do not allow yourself to be conditioned. Now, when we say like that our subconscious may not be very much powerful. 


But the other side is even worse. The other side is a terrible, absolutely terrorizing thing called Mr. Ego. If that develops then there is no end to our nonsense. Then you become nothing but “I”, like a stick, you know. Anybody comes there he knows, you are that. So what to do, is the problem. The dilemma before people is: what to do? If you get rid of your subconscious then you will get your supraconscious in the sense that you start planning for the future. Then, “What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” The family system breaks down, the sinfulness is accepted, there’s no righteousness in life, nobody can talk of righteousness, there’s no worry about what you are doing to the society or to yourself. “What’s wrong? If I am doing like that, what’s wrong?” It goes on like that. So the other side develops. 


Now the first side, subconscious, gives you the deadliest disease called cancer. Cancer comes from the subconscious area. Not from the supraconscious, but from supraconscious you develop diseases like heart, paralysis, diabetes. Cancer is developed because your subconscious is overloaded. It will work out through ego; doesn’t matter. Means you create an emergency within yourself. If you create an emergency within you ? physical, mental, emotional, any kind of an emergency ? means you are loading your subconscious. For example, I go on rubbing this finger all my life, you see. There are people funny, funny type we have. There are some called Jains, you know. I don’t know if you have heard about them. In their religion you are not supposed to use any razor. I don’t know why. They are specially against razors, you know. Absolutely.  So you have to pluck your hair, all from all over with your own hand. They go on plucking their hair because they are not supposed to cut it, you see. You cannot use razor, you see. Can you imagine? That extreme. Is, is the truth. So they go on plucking like this, all the time. And even if they have lost all their hair, still they’ll be going on like that. This can develop an emergency in the different muscles, into different [hands]. Anything can develop an emergency, like as you suggested last time that if you put a metal in the body it develops an emergency. Just if you introduce the metal. As soon as an emergency is created the subconscious starts wriggling, pumping, expanding. When the subconscious starts expanding then we move to the left hand side. The movement to the left hand side gives us a very dangerous position because in the left hand side is the collective subconscious. All that is dead since your creation, since your creation ? I’m again saying that ? is all there. All the kinds of vegetables that have gone out of circulation of evolution, all the kinds of matter that have gone out of circulation, all the kinds of, we can say, insects, animals, and the last human beings. All that is dead exists in they, within ourselves, within our being. Everything exists within us. You don’t have to go outside. So we get exposed to that very dangerous area of subconscious, when it expands. You may not be consciously conditioning yourself. For example, people thought it’s too much conditioning to wear the grey suits or, say, the tail coats. It may be too much. So they said, “All right. Let us take to another style of life.” So they said, “Oh, this is all junk. Let’s dress up in such a way that we look like nothing on earth.” All right, this is an emergency. Because you look so funny, you are to be attacked. 


Simple thing is, say, London is a place where you must walk with an umbrella. Actually, you play your hockey and also football with an umbrella on. And the person who walks without an umbrella during rain in London has to get cold. He may say, “Oh, I don’t care. You see, I am not formal.” That’s how the dress develops. That’s how the attitude develops. Now, he says, “I’m not going to be conditioned. No, I’m not going to carry an umbrella. If it is raining, doesn’t matter. I’m not going to have raincoat or anything, any appendages like that, you see. I’ll just walk in my same suit.” He’ll really swim through, I tell you. You just can’t do that. You are a human being. You are not a hippopotamus. But they want to be hippopotamus when they are human beings, because of ego. This is what it is. Either we want to be monkeys or we want to be tigers or we want to be lions, but we don’t want to be human beings that we are, because of Mr. Ego, which teaches you that you should be something different. These things create an emergency, and these emergencies lead us into areas which are very dangerous. 


Like, I would say, there’s a fire, supposing, in the other room. All right, is an emergency created. All right? What happens that when the fire is there we get so frightened. We enter into another place. And from fire to frying pan we will land up into something else. So to be normal, to be in the center, as Buddha has said, to lead a normal life, and not to be unique and abnormal. Sometimes they do it just to create a new sense value, that people should be able to see your faces. That’s why some people walk with red hair. All sorts of things people do, being normal, in the center. And to do that you don’t have to do anything. You are born a normal person; lead a normal life. I mean, if you are abnormally, handicapped or anything, that’s a different point. But even normal people behave like that.  Like this, your Grand Prix and all those things that you do. I mean, you have got hands, feet, everything, thanks God for that. After some time you find a person without one leg. “What?” “I was in Grand Prix.” Begging on the street with a violin in the hand. All these subconscious problems come to us and stick to us because of our ego. If we do not identify ourselves with this subconscious and say, “No, no, nothing this. This is not important.” It comes from a very small areas. Like I can tell you about Indians very well because I have seen it very clearly. They are very particular about washing their hands, having their baths. They must have a bath every day. Can you believe it? Even in England. I’m not guilty so I can tell you. And then take a bath in the morning and then go to their work. They don’t feel all right without that. They don’t feel all right, you see; this is the point is. And they die of lung cancer in this country. Day in and day out, day in and day out, for years together. “Oh, I never catch cold. Nothing happens to me. I’m very happy.” And suddenly you find they get a very galloping type of a cancer. 


So we have to know that we live in a nature, in a country, in a place; we have to adjust our body to that. We must respect that. You must respect that nature and not to fight it. Like we are modern people. Accept that we live with these machines and things like that. What’s the use of growing your hair like a primitive man? You cannot go, you cannot exist as you exist in dense forests of Amazon, can you? We create such emergencies for ourselves by doing these extra special things that, that tells upon our subconscious and we become very much prone to cancer. I mean, I would say that people can develop cancer from a small thing like you have got those people who announce, “His Excellency, such and such coming”. He may find after some times he becomes “His Excellency” in the throat.  It is possible. Overdoing it, all the time doing the same thing. Shaking hands now. I mean sometimes really we shake hands with six hundred and seventy, eighty people.  I, I, I do that. I think, “Now, what’s going to happen?” Just going on shaking hands with people. But change it a little bit. Now it has been on from I don’t know, George the Third or whatever it was. It’s still on. It’s on in our country, same way, in England and all these, you see, habit formations like that, that everybody must conform to that subconscious. I mean, sometimes for a change, let us say like this, sometimes shake hands, sometimes walk about. No, it’s the same form on and on and on. But I am not against tradition by any chance. For that I must say that traditions which are real traditions are always helpful. But traditions which are just mechanical. 


For example, paying respect to elders, paying respect to a saint. Now these days, of course, you can get saints by the dozens. So if you pay five pounds you can get a saint, standing there to take some more money from you. So, you can get saints and saints and saints. But still, all such traditions which makes you sublime, a higher personality, they are helpful to life. When I say that subconscious is not to be nourished and is to be looked after that I do not mean by any chance that you give up your good traditions. So there are some bad things and there are some good things that we need. And the good things we need are su samaskaras, are called as good conditionings. There is no word in English like su but su means the one which is good for your Spirit. So the samaskaras or the conditionings that are good for you. Outright rejection of the complete subconscious is as stupid as outright cancelation of your supraconscious. You have to balance it. You have to keep a balanced life between the two. Now when they break traditions they break it so much, so hard that the whole set society was cracked out completely. Can’t you do it little bit? Must you crack down everything? And that is how another kind of emergency settles in, in society. 


Now, today which is the emergency which is the worst of all, for which you are not aware of? I think you people are not aware in the West which is the worst of all emergency that is settling in, in every human being, is a sense of insecurity. Your medias, they blast you every morning. You start feeling, what’s happening? Shocks. Anywhere you go you find, “Oh, God, this disaster, that disaster.” They never talk of anything that will give you peace, tranquility, that will console you, make you happy. You go home; your wife quarrels with you. With such an emergency, what happen?  “Oh, the tap is out of gear and you never did this. You didn’t do that. You don’t do that.” It could be vice versa; I mean, wife means husband, husband means wife. But the emergencies we create for others, do we understand that we are creating cancer for others? Do we? 


A man marries a woman. Just see, this is very subtle one has to understand. And then he says, “Oh, what’s wrong? I’m just friendly with someone.” Like that. He flirts with other women. He has a keep or something. The woman develops insecurity within herself, and she develops a horrible disease called as breast cancer. The insecurities that develop within us, if they are carried too far by us, you see, by people who think, “Oh, God, how insecure I am.” And to overcome that they end up their lives in the pubs and things like that and think that they can get rid of their problems are even worse, much more vulnerable. Those who try to escape the truth and go into subconscious more. Like you see, here there’s an emergency. If somebody runs into this room, there’s safety, but supposing you run into Scotland Yard, what will happen? It’s like that. Then emergency develops if you try to run. You might land up into very, very serious trouble. Face it. If your husband, husband is misbehaving you get after him. Tell him, “This won’t work out. You have to be a faithful man. Nothing doing.” And you see to that woman that she gets out. Give her two, three slaps. Doesn’t matter. She deserves it. She has no business to meddle with your married life. If the wife behaves like that, slap her nicely. She has no business to be infidel to you. Solve the problem. But do not be a person, “Oh, I don’t want to say anything. Let it be. Now he is in love.” Blow off such loves and things which creates problems for you. Just go and finish off all these nonsensical things. This creates horrible emergencies for men and women, and worst of all for children. 


We need peace. Human beings have to live in peace. They are beautifully made. They are made with such care. They are delicate beings. They are not to be hurt. They are not to be tortured. They are not to be troubled. Try to be kind to them. If the parents are not kind to the children, if a person does not have his parents in childhood, he is a volcanic personality. You have to be very, very kind to other people and nice to them. Do not create emergencies in their lives. If you create emergencies in their lives you are responsible for their troubles and their diseases. One must realize that human being is the most delicate thing that God has created so far. When you really love human beings as a whole you will realize this. And you’ll be amazed how we handle each other. The way we shout, the way we scream at others. There’s no delicacy of handling of other people and that’s why, as I said, that if you are unpopular for your meticulous nature or for your over-asserting or for your ego, you must know that you are creating an emergency for others. Ego might give you a satisfaction: “Oh, I’ve done her right, that’s what. I’ve done him right. It’s good for him. Let him have it.” But there is God above us who will judge us. But when we talk of the subconscious, you see, we suddenly go into extremes of that also. It’s something, human beings are always to be said, “Don’t go too much this side”. Supposing you fall, this side you fall or you go that side and fall, you fall, isn’t it? Is it that when you come this side you do not fall and that side you fall? So both the sides if you move, go to extremes, you fall. So both the sides must be saved, and that’s why I must warn you before I stop this lecture that when we go too much to the subconscious and we worry too much about the subconscious, then, what happens? “Oh, don’t say anything. Let him do what he likes. He is doing anything. I shouldn’t say anything. Why should we be harsh to them? And we should not hurt after all. Whatever he’s doing, he’s all right. Do not hurt him.” Even if Mother Earth comes before you, “Oh, please, please, don’t say anything to him. Now he’s not a murderer.” This, this is going to another side. This is called as kayvalya in Sanskrit, in which people give up their weapons, like Arjuna did. 



Arjuna was a disciple of Shri Krishna, just like My disciples here, you know. He was also there. And when the war came, I mean he was a great warrior till the war started. When the war started he said, “Oh, Krishna, what’s the use of killing these? They are my brothers and my sisters, my teacher, my revered elders. How can I kill them? Just for a piece of land. I cannot kill them.” He gets into that subconscious mood. And on this base was based Krishna’s philosophy. Those who can read through the lines can see that he tried to establish that this kind of a non-violence of a poor person, of a weak, is no non-violence. It is cowardice. It’s kayvalya.  Even the non-violence of Arjuna is cowardice. For He said, “Who is killed? Your Spirit is never killed.” But for the religious establishment – religion doesn’t mean, I mean the Wars of Roses and all that – I mean the religion within yourself, for standing up, for the truth, of any cause is the war of dharma, is the war of sustenance, that sustains the society. So you have to rise against all such things. You have to fight it, because if you fight for that, you get your moksha. And if you live, people will call you victorious. It is a very balancing factor. 


Like, many people tell Me, I mean they have told Me many times also that, “Mother, why do you criticize the fake gurus?” What should I do? Should I garland them? These are horrible devils who were born before also and were killed by Goddess. And today I see them so clearly and should I go and say, “Oh, you great people”? What should I do? Krishna has said that, “Whenever there is fall of sustenance [Hindi], when it goes down, the righteousness falls off then [Hindi], to kill, to destroy these horrible negative forces [Hindi] to save and to sustain the saints, [Hindi] I come in every age in human form.” It was Christ who on the cross said that, “Forgive them, oh Father, for they do not know what they are doing.” And the same One took a hunter and hit these people hard when they were making money in the name of God. We never see the balancing factor in life; that’s typical of human beings. If they go on to one side they’ll go on to one side. If they go on to another, either they become Hitlers or they’ll become some sort of, I don’t know what to call them, some sort of people who are, who have no backbone, nothing. Cabbages.  You are human beings and the human being has to be in the center. And this is what always I try to tell you that when I talk about subconscious I want you to have the balancing thing, and this comes to you through wisdom of Sahaja Yoga. Because when you get your realization you get the vibrations flowing in the hand. And you can find out when you lose your vibrations, because that’s the time you are losing your balance. 


This cool, this cool breeze that’s flowing through you, it’s manifesting the Holy Ghost within you. This is the Brahmashakti and that suggests, “Oh, you are going into imbalance.” But Sahaja yogis, specially in England, are very intelligent people. Specially in London they are even extra-intelligent. They make a politics out of Sahaja Yoga also. It’s nice to be in politics. So that they claim, “Oh, we are communists. We are this. We are that.” They say, “All right, we are Sahaja yogis and we have to fight all such forces which are against us, against our Self-realization, against our emancipation.” But we carry on with all these weaknesses. We go on living with them. We do not work out simple methods of Sahaja Yoga to get rid of them. We are quite satisfied with ourselves as we are. We do not grow, because we have an ego which says, “Oh, you are all right. Oh, Mataji was very kind to you. She smiled at you.” God knows what it meant. “All the vibrations are all right. Yes, yes, perfect. I am very good. I am nothing. I am not doing anything wrong.” That is how they live. Either one has to change or one has to spare God forever. You cannot stand on two stools. 


It has been My experience now because I worked in London itself for so many years that even now the Sahaja yogis of London every time require a reminder that you have to cleanse yourself. Keep your mind clean, your heart clean. Because Mataji perhaps is a good speaker you just come here, listen to Her and forget about it. It’s not going to help. My lectures are just useless, absolutely useless if you cannot rise up to the point where you feel you are really clean. You all have to work it out. Do not justify it. For human beings it is important to know that after realization you are attacked, much more than you are attacked before. Temptations are much more. The Satan himself came to tempt Christ, because he knew that Christ was so powerful. In the same way when you are saints the temptations come to you. If you yield to them, then it can be very dangerous. We have to know that as we are delicate we have to be careful. But as we have the power to overgrow these things as Sahaja yogis we have to take arms into our hands and fight ourselves out. We have to create such Sahaja yogis in London that they themselves become the advertisement. 


As today we were discussing what to do about Sahaja Yoga, how to advertize, how to do this. Nothing works out. What works out really is a pure Sahaja yogi, a good Sahaja yogi. Example is of one Mr. Dumal. He went to the Commissioner’s Office in Pune and while dealing with the thing – maybe Indians are more sensitive to saints – they recognized that he was a saint. They said, “Sir, will you please tell us who is your Guru?” He said that, “I have a Mother.” And all that office of that commissioner is today [in] Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis. One person just changed the whole thing, transformed it. When we think of organizing things for Sahaja Yoga and all that, we must know are we ourselves organized to that extent.  All right, Mother works very hard, She cleanses you, She works for three, four hours, She’ll cleanse your subconscious. She’ll do this. But how are you yourself? What is your own picture about you yourself? And this is important, very important, for all of us. It’s a very important time we are in. There are so many seekers who are getting just drowned. For no fault of theirs they can be lost. Every Sahaja yogi has a duty towards his Spirit and towards God Almighty that he must try his level best to keep himself beautifully shining and shining others with joy, happiness and bliss. May God bless you all. 


We have to make one thing very clear to all the people, new people who come to Sahaja Yoga. Supposing somebody has a background of a terrible black magic training and all that, or somebody is a teacher, say, of say TM or a teacher, or a gururaj business or sort of a person, you see, if you have all this kind of background you have to be extra careful about yourself. You have to be extra careful, because after realizations of people, even here in the hall, they are terrified within yourself and they would like to run away. But when you are alone they will try to tempt you in the beginning. So after realization you have to establish yourself with very great care. Otherwise, you can be lost; you can be in trouble. And then don’t blame Sahaja Yoga for that. Whatever is Sahaja Yoga, it is. You cannot mould it. It is the way it is. Whatever background you have, your subconscious, wherever have you been, you please remember that, that you have to be very careful. At least for a month, you must be very, very careful and see to it that you do not expose yourself to these old environments. I would suggest that you better keep more to yourself at least for seven to ten days. Do not go out too much. Keep to yourself. You are precious things for God.  He looks after you, no doubt. But as you have been through so many horrible things it’s possible that you might be attacked. And then don’t blame Sahaja Yoga for that. That can happen, has happen to so many people I know all. So be careful after getting realization. Like the seedling, when it’s sprouted how we are careful with the seedling for some time till it becomes a tree. We not so careful with the seed ? we are not ? but with the seedling. It’s so delicate. That’s how you must look after your realization. That’s how you must work it out. Can I have questions from you?


[Hindi to Her niece] So this is a question coming. [Hindi with Her niece] Now, is there any question? Little loudly. [Hindi to Her niece] Say it a little loudly for Me. 


Sahaja yogi: [unclear]


Shri Mataji: Gavin, you come here and just tell Me. I’m just….Today My ears are blown inside out, you see. I’ve been working on someone which has really killed Me in action. Just ask, what he’s saying. Just whatever he says, repeat it. Ha. Just ask the question please. Ha. 


Sahaja yogi: You have insisted to being attacked or picking things out [of madness]. May I ask if one should try to avoid that or whether one should just accept it? 


Shri Mataji: All right. Sit. Good question. He said if you are attacked whether one should avoid it or one should accept it. It’s a very simple answer. Now, any Sahaja yogi who can answer it? Let’s see. Now, testing point. Ah, such simple things, I tell you. What happens to the intellectuals? Come along. No answer? Ha…


Sahaja yogi: Just stay in thoughtless awareness.


Shri Mataji: That’s true, but you know, this question is very, very straight. If you are attacked should you run away from that or should you face it? 


Sahaja Yogi: [Face it. You are supposed to.]


Shri Mataji: Ah?


Sahaja Yogi: Face it. Endeavor to face it. 


Shri Mataji: No, no, not necessarily. It’s very simple, I tell you. It’s very simple. It’s this, that if you can face it, face it. Otherwise, you run away. There’s no need to face. Forget it. We are not responsible for all these mad people. No. With the speed of the five hundred miles per hour if it is coming to you. It’s very simple. Again the wisdom. This is the balancing part. You need not. If I say face, doesn’t mean anybody coming you face. Measure it up. All right? If you can, manage it. Otherwise, take the other course; makes no difference. In Sahaja Yoga you are not branded as anything like a man with a sword. You are a man with a sword and also a shield. If it comes to the shield, all right, have the shield on. [And /have fun/ I find] you can place the shield into his hands and run away. It’s all right. We must learn; this is known as Krishna nithi. On this I will tell you a very simple example of Krishna’s style. He’s called as ranchordas, the one who ran away from the fields. Imagine, Krishna’s name is ranchordas, the one who ran away from the fields. You know, it’s such a shameful thing to run away.


There was a horrible devil who was given certain boons by Brahmadeva. And he could not be killed by normal methods, you see. And Krishna knew that He won’t be able to kill him with His sudarshan chakra. He didn’t want His sudarshan chakra to be spoiled, you see, the thing, that discus He used. So He knew about a big sage who was meditating in his sleep in a cave very near that battlefield. And this sage had a boon that “As soon as you will open your eyes from this meditation, the first person you will see will become into ashes”. So Krishna started running away from the field, you see. People said, “Oh, look at Him! Like a coward He’s running.” But this devil would not give in. He started running after Him. Krishna ran very fast you see, played all the tricks, illusions, and He ran. And He was covering Himself with a shawl, like this. And this sage was sleeping there. He went and very delicately He put His shawl on top of that sage. And he was still fast asleep. When this fellow followed Him into the cave, Krishna had hidden Himself. He went into the cave, you see. And he thought that was Krishna who was sleeping there. He started saying, “Hey, you Krishna, now You are sleeping here, You are tired, You ran out of the field, but I’m going to kill You.” And as soon as he said that, this fellow got up and looked at him and the fellow became into ashes. 


It is tomfoolery to fight someone who is going to trouble us. Why should we? But if you can face up to someone you should. Then you become so very strong like Me, I should say, that you don’t run away. But sometimes I also run away, I must tell you, as I get fed up sometimes, the way things are. Not from demonic forces so much as from some of the Sahaja yogis. I see to it that they don’t see Me anymore. Because they never improve. They always become tools, instruments in the hands of Satanic forces and bring horrible things to Me. Then I don’t want to have mosquitoes around, isn’t it? Then you want to put a mosquito net around you, in the same way.  If you don’t ask mosquitoes, “You come and bite and I’ll bite you.” So it could be on any level. We have to judge with our wisdom. One must know that Sahaja yogis are the most important thing in the whole creation today. One should not become egoistical, of course, and must keep the balance. But they are, no doubt. So we should know how to preserve ourselves and preserve forward not for pickling out yourself but for fighting. But first, preservation is important. If you are not there, what are you fighting with? So it’s question of wisdom. It’s very simple. Sahaja Yoga is so simple, no complication. Like this, you judge everything. I mean, these norms of human acceptance is like, you see, you are a big hero, even if you cut your nose. That’s not in Sahaja Yoga. You are not going to cut your nose but you’ll be a hero. That’s how. I would not like any one of My children to be hurt even this much. And there are so many ways of avoiding it. Now, any other question? 


This lady is there. For her I have to tell her one thing, that you must understand what you have to have as a seeker. That’s very important. Otherwise one would never see who is all right, who is not all right. Like TM, let’s say, the better. People may say, “What’s wrong? What’s good?” First of all, let’s go on to that point. The minimum of minimum: what’s good it has done? It has polished off your money? Are you flying? Anyone of you are flying? Face it. Everybody has become a poor person, has got epilepsy. So many of them have got epilepsy. Are you cured of your troubles? Are you physically helped? No, so it’s nothing good. Why should you pay? Only good it has got is one that it takes money from you. You see, makes you little lighter if you have too much. No? No income tax problem, bank problem. It’s already gone. If that is the thing you want to have, then it’s all right. Then go ahead of it. Has your life been helped? In any other way, are you a recluse? Or are you a person who, who can articulate with others very normal? The highest of highest: one should know that you are the Spirit. Are you manifesting your Spirit anywhere? Are collectively conscious? Are you actually collectively conscious or just it’s a make-belief? Are you that awareness which is described? Just face it. 


Sahaja Yoga is just the other way around, you know. You cannot please it by giving money to it. No, it doesn’t consider anything like that. Also it cannot bother about how many efforts you have put in, how many times you have been in and all that. No, it doesn’t bother about this thing. On the contrary, if you are still attached to all such things it just recedes. It recedes. It’s recession, all the time. It’s very difficult. I go on pushing it; recedes, you see. Either you have to change your attitude or it has to change. But it does not because it is eternal thing. It does not change; it’s changeless. So you better change your attitude and accept it. Otherwise the Spirit is changeless. It recedes back. It recedes to such an extent that one may get a heart attack and die, because of this recession. So you have to really come with an attitude of reception; otherwise it recedes. 


Sahaja Yoga is such a beautiful thing but its qualities are not changeable. There’s no compromise, no compromise. It does not compromise. It stands in its own authority, in its own glory, in its own nature. It doesn’t change. You can pay any amount of money or need not pay, you may put in effort, nothing, you bring to any color, creed, anything, makes no difference to Sahaja Yoga, nothing. It’s the acceptance. It’s the readily acceptance of your Spirit and not of your ego. While in other places they might pamper your ego, they might give you a mesmerism hurting your superego, here it is your Spirit, absolutely your Spirit which you have to achieve, which, to which you have to surrender, to recognize that you are the Spirit. All right? No flying, no jumping, nothing. It’s the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit. It’s as simple as that. One has to have a humble attitude towards it. Otherwise the Spirit doesn’t come. One has to be humble. It’s a grace, it’s a gift, it’s a gift of God. It’s your own, I agree it’s your own, but it’s a gift. And for that we have to accept it with a humble heart. Otherwise it doesn’t work out. It won’t work out, My child. It won’t work out. I’m your Mother, all right, but Sahaja Yoga it’s not [unclear]. Mother means many things. Sahaja Yoga is not; it judges you very much. I do not, but it does. So be careful. Mother is much larger than Sahaja Yoga. And so She forgives and She knows and She tells you and She says, “No, no, no, no.” It’s all right.  But I must warn you that Sahaja Yoga recedes. That’s why we have few Sahaja yogis. You have to accept it, for your own good, with understanding. 


Sahaja yogi: [unclear] 


Shri Mataji: Aaaa? Can I? If you just come forward. 


Sahaja yogi: As one grows, one becomes more connected, and more connected with other people and one wonders what happens in this cleansing process when one may lose the desire or one becomes cleansed in some way.


Shri Mataji: Desire for? 


Sahaja yogi: No, but one wonders what happens to the desires that one loses, and whether the people one is connected with have to bear that burden. Could You say anything about? 


Shri Mataji: Have to bear what?


Sahaja Yogi: Any burden that it’s shed from us in the cleansing process. 


Shri Mataji: All right. Please be seated. You see, now if you, say, are a person who is a married man. Say, example I am saying. You do not give up your marriage in Sahaja Yoga. On the contrary, you become a tougher person to bear it up if there’s a problem. You become a sweeter person to enjoy it. And you become a master how to solve the problems of married life. So actually what happens is that the situations that are created or the things that looks so impossible start become absolutely like a myth to you and you know how to solve them. So you do not have to succeed from people but gradually you will start changing your priorities.  You will start yourself automatically. Because you won’t enjoy their company but you will have another company, the company of people with whom you should be identified. They are your type, your style, who think for the betterment of one’s own Spirit and the Spirit of this Universe. Such people. Now all such people have to gather together. [One day, When] they [can] start clinging together, all of them. All right? Maybe in the beginning you might find some of them may not join you. They may think, “Oh, he’s gone. He’s finished. He’s no good.” But we are normal people, we live like normal people, there’s no dress, special dress, nothing. I mean you just behave like absolutely normal people. You do not sever your relations with anyone. There’s no need to sever. With whom to sever relations if you are not connected with anyone? It’s a question of inner detachment. Only thing you get concerned about people that they are not in Sahaja Yoga. Also you get concerned about people who try to go against God.  And when you realize what is the truth with your family, with everyone. 


Now we have in Sahaja Yoga one person comes in, the family comes in. Now, Ray is here; his parents are now Sahaja yogis in Sheffield. When I’m going to see them there, I’ll be very happy to meet them. So many people who gave up their parents. Kay is here or so many like that have gone back to their parents. So it’s a different thing altogether. It’s a living process of the manifestation of Divine Love. The whole thing changes. But one thing is sure: you cannot force Sahaja Yoga on anyone. My own daughters are not yet realized souls. What can I do? It’s all right. When the time will come they will get it. I’ve never forced that on them. They may not be even knowing what is Kundalini perhaps, maybe.  So My daughters, how many daughters I must have had and I have, how many wives you must have had in previous lives and how many husbands, God alone knows. So why worry? That way you are so lonely, isn’t it? Only in collective consciousness you have common feeling, commonness. “Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?” asked Christ.  Just have a very balanced attitude, neither of joy nor of, I mean, expression of some sort of a thing like that, or of any unhappiness. Just be, just be watching, just be watching. 


Mmmm, getting in? It’s very subtle. It’s very subtle. But when it happens you start feeling it very much. Put your hands straight, straight like this. [Missing part]
