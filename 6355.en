Public Program in Kiev (Ukraine). 21 July 1996.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We can not change it. We can not transform it. We have to experience it. Whatever I have told you, to most of you, it has been proved. And there are many new people I see here, they all are go into experience the Truth tonight. Because we do not know the Absolute Truth. That means we are still blind and that's why there are problems on humane level as well as on global level. We do everything to enjoy life. But whatever we do has no enjoyment but a kind of a lurking anxiety. So make yourself happy and joyous you have to know the Absolute Truth. Then you are not bothered. 

We have six enemies at least. Humane beings have first the lust, the greed. Jealousies, ego, also false pride. And lastly of all is violence. When we try to use these enemies to harm others in return we are harmed. Also we harm others. We have to get rid of this humane flaw within us. But by telling people, "Don't do, don't do" it doesn't work out. There has to be an ascent, there has to be a global transformation when one goes beyond all these enemies. These enemies work through our mind. And mind is a myth. We have created our mind by reactions. We have our mind created by conditionings or by our ego. But there's nothing like mind which exists. We have become also slave of that mind. Now if you make, say, a watch you become slave of the watch. If you make the computer you become the slave of the computer. This is a humane tendency to make something and become the slave of that. 
So through the media of this so-called mind all these six enemies act on us. So we have to transcend this area of mind and go beyond. For that arrangements are made within us. You have been already told about the Kundalini and the centers that we have. These six centers or seven centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual being. And all our problems come through the jeopardies, when these centers go into jeopardy. So to correct them Kundalini has to rise. When She rises She corrects those centers by enlightening them. She integrates those centers. And ultimately She connects you to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love. Look at these flowers. From where do they come? It's such a miracle. But we take it for granted. These flowers are created by this Mother Earth through the same Power of Divine Love. This Power is very intelligent, at the same time full of compassion. This Power acts in every sphere of life wherever something living has to be done. And that living work is done within us also. 


Once you get connected with this Divine Love your Spirit comes into your attention and your attention is enlightened. This enlightened attention acts because it gets the power of compassion that acts. When your chakras are put right you get your physical being all right then your diseases have been cured. Many mental cases have been cured. And many people who have gone into wrong path of spirituality also get corrected. I remember first time I came to Ukraine there were so many sick people out of Chernobyl problem. Even children were suffering. Then they were cured. And today I find they're in such happy conditions. It's so many people realized, with the Divine Power acting all other problems - political and other problems will be solved. These problems are nothing compare to the power of this All Pervading Power. So far we have been deceived in the name of God. Wrong people have taken the charge of religion. These religions are money-oriented or they are power-oriented. By that they make everyone suffer. If there is God, Who is Love, one should not do anything wrong. If I tell you, "Don't do this, don't do that" you will not listen to Me in these modern times. But you yourself got the light, light of the Spirit and you become your own guide, you correct yourself. I've told you before an example that supposing I'm an obstinate person and having a snake in My hand. And somebody tells Me I have a snake in My hand, I'm obstinate in darkness, I won't listen. But if there is little light I'll immediately leave it. In the same way it acts. We don't have to tell them. I have learned with great regret that there's a big drug problem here. You'll be surprised to know that in England people gave up drugs overnight when they came to Sahaja Yoga. I was surprised in Togliatti the mafia people have now trying Sahaja Yoga (Shri Mataji laughs). Only by forgiving them they have come back to a very normal life. This should happen here also. Because everybody wants peace, joy. But they are lost, they don't know how to fight these enemies. But once they go beyond this mind then they give up all this. They realize where lies the joy. 


Not only that you can be enlightened but you can enlighten others. Many people I have known who were not even artists have become great artists, have become musicians, have become very well to do. It is very surprising how your powers start acting. You can give Realization to others. You can change people. You can give peace and joy. All these powers are within you. Like this instrument if it is not connected to the mains it doesn't work. It has no identity. It has no meaning. In the same way unless and until we are connected to the mains we have no identity. But once you are connected this Divine Power starts flowing. Your life gets filled up with lots of miracles. In Sahaja Yoga miracle has lost it's meaning. Saha means "with", ja means "born". That is this power of becoming one with the Divine is born with you. And you have a birthright to get it. 
Specially these are very important times. What we call as the Last Judgment. But I call it as the blossom time where many flowers are going to get their fruits. These are very special times when you are tortured, you are troubled, you are unhappy and have many illusions. At this time it works so fast. I'm amazed how it is spreading. It is something you must understand is a living process of your evolution. This is the last break-through of your evolution. Specially in your country I find people are extremely sensitive to spirituality. I don't know how so many have taken to Sahaja Yoga. Is very remarkable. All over the world I am praising people from Ukraine and from Russia. Must be something of previous lives - I just can't explain. But in our books it written that two great saints called [SOUNDS LIKE Machindarnath] and [SOUNDS LIKE Goraknath] came to Ukraine and to Russia. And there they described that there are lots man of God living there. And they taught them about Kundalini because I can see on your terracottas of those times there is Kundalini everywhere and the chakras and all those drown on those terracotta pots. So I think you are especially blessed people. I'm very happy I could come to Ukraine and meet you and talk to you about so simple. If you have any problems you can always write to Me. But mostly what I receive the letters are about how they are enjoying life, how they are happy. 

Last but not the least you jump into ocean of joy. All the wrong things we do to get some enjoyment. But then we don't have to do anything, we don't have to achieve anything, you are just in the ocean of joy. Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness, it's singular. That everything then starts giving you joy, everything you see gives you joy. If there is anything ridiculous you laugh. If there is anything cruel you get defective on that. And the even a gruel personality can become very nice and sweet. These are the science of saintliness. And you become saints and enjoy your saintliness. For that you don't have to give up your family, give up your household, go to Himalayas or stand on your head. It is just within you. And it acts. It will work. I am sure
things would be much easier for you.


May God bless you.


(Shri Mataji speaks aside.) Should we have some music little bit? Could have one song. Before no, no. Before no. Later on. First I let people to get Realization. I'll give one Realization then you sing one song.


Now those who do not want to have I can not force. You have to have your own judgment. But it's very easy, it won't trouble you, on the contrary, you'll feel very much elated. So those who want to go should go now but don't disturb later on. It will hardly take five to ten minutes. 


First of all none of you should feel guilty for anything. You have not to confess anything to Me. Whatever wrong has been done it was in the past. You have to be in the present. And for that you should not be angry with yourself for anything that was done wrong in the past. But if you feel guilty then you catch on this center on the left hand side. With that you get diseases like angina, like spondylitis, like lethargic organs. And at this moment the Kundalini won't pass through.


Now there's another problem that you must forgive yourself; also in the same way forgive others. Many say that it's difficult to forgive. But whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything. Actually by not forgiving you torture yourself. You just have to say in your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone" and you'll feel much lighter. Also you should not think whom you have to forgive because it's a headache. So you forgive yourself and forgive others. And also if you can take out your shoes will be very helpful. Please take out your shoes.
This center is like this - very constricted. And if you don't forgive it won't open. And this is a very important time. If you don't forgive now you'll miss the chance of your evolution. 


Now just put both your hands towards Me like this. 


Now put down your head and put your right hand on top of your fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming out of your own fontanel bone area. Now don't doubt yourself. Some people get it closer, some people get it far away. But don't please put your hand on top of your head. 


Now please put your right hand towards Me. And now again bend your head. And see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself or you have not forgiven others. Please bend your head. So now you forgive yourself and others.


Now please put your left hand towards Me. Again, once again, please put your head down and see with your right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. If it is still hot then please forgive yourself and others. 


Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this. And push back your head. And ask one of these questions, one of these questions three times. You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Now please ask in your heart, "Mother, is this a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Or, "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?" Or, thirdly, "Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?" You can ask anyone of these one question three times.


Now bring down your hands. Put both the hands towards Me. Please bring down your hands. If you are getting cool breeze on your fingertips or on the palm or out of your fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. (Shri Mataji laughs) Like flags. Flags of peace and joy. Tremendous, I tell. 


May God bless you all.


This is the beginning but you have to meditate, that's very important. And grow into it. You don't have to pay for it. It's a living process. And you can not pay for any living process. Don't doubt yourself.


Thank you. May God bless you.


Now they can sing one song.
