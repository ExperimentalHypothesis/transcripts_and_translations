[Full speech - 45:00 – 2:09:11]

Tell them, when I am lecturing don't take photographs, will be better, see when I am lecturing they should not take photograph, otherwise

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, you have to know that truth is what it is; you cannot change it; you cannot conceptualize it; and unfortunately at human level with human awareness you cannot know it. Now, whatever I am going to tell you today here you should not follow it blind folded. We have had lots of problems with blind faith but if it is proved so treat it like a hypothesis and if it is proved then you have to accept it as honest people. Because it is for your benevolence, benevolence of your family, benevolence of your country and benevolence of the whole world. Most of the problem if you face come from human beings in this world. We create the problems and these problems unfortunately come from the subtle centre from these chakras. If these centres are in jeopardy then you have physical problems, emotion problems, spiritual problems and collectively then you have political, economic and other problems. So we have to know what is the truth, the truth is that you are not this body, mind, your emotions, your intelligence but you are the pure spirit. You see these beautiful flowers and you don't know this is a miracle. We take all living work for granted. In the same way, if we ask a doctor who runs our heart? He will say it’s the autonomous nervous system but who is this auto? So there are many things which cannot be answered through science because science has its own limitations; it cannot answer the question why are we on this earth? It cannot answer the question what is the purpose of our evolution? Why have we become human beings? For this, one has to know that our human awareness is also limited. So some thing more has to happen to us in our evolutionary process. Moreover, we do not know what is the absolute truth. Somebody says this is good, some body say that is good and there are so many discussions, arguments and wars. If we are all human beings the same, our brain are the same why should we have different ideas? And why should we fight? Why should we kill each other? This is not understood because we do not know the absolute truth, it’s all relative. We live in a relative world. So when this subtle system works out and this power rises up and becomes one with this all pervading power which this is the power which does all the living work. When we get connected with this all pervading subtle power around us, then we know the absolute truth on our central nervous system. This is known in Sanskrit as a 'Bodh' from where the Buddha got as a Bodh to know on your central nervous system. It is not just our mental idea; it is actualization of reality. As you all can see me sitting here, there is no doubt in your mind that I am sitting here. In the same way, you know the truth on your central nervous system. Whatever we have achieved in our evolutionary process, we have felt it on our central nervous system. For an example, if a dog or horse has to go through a very dirty lake it can go easily but human beings cannot because they have a subtler awareness.

So the second truth is that there is a all pervading power of divine love; in every religion it is described; in Koran even it is described and is called as 'Rooh'. In Koran it is written that at this time which is called the kiyama means resurrection time; your hands will speak. Even in the Bible we have Last Judgement; of course in the Indian scriptures it is described as 'Uthan ' means resurrection time. This is the resurrection time, when people will have spiritual awareness.

Now the spirit resides in your heart and the ruling; we called the God Almighty can call it, resides here on your fontanel bone area. So when this Kundalini goes through this sixth centre; it nourishes it and also it integrates. Then you start feeling a cool breeze like sensation of this all-pervading power. It’s described in Indian scriptures as 'cool cool, salilam salilam'. It is described in the Bible as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. The time now has come for you to know all the realities. So first you know about your centres means you get the self knowledge. When you feel on your finger tips the different centres, you know what’s wrong within you and what is to be corrected. You will be happy to know that in India we have three doctors who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga. So it is tangible. If you have 10 children and cover their eyes and ask them what’s wrong with this gentleman, they are realized soul then they will tell you only one or two fingers like burning, they will show you. Supposing they show you this finger (Right Heart) that means the person is suffering from lung trouble. You don't have to go through the cruelties of diagnoses. You don't have to take medicines which react, which give you other troubles. Now they are even condemning antibiotics completely; (antibiotics they are).

So what we reach the point that whatever treatment is there available now is still related but this is absolute. If the diagnosis is done is absolute and treatment that is given is also absolute; may be it may not act on about 10% people because of various reasons but it acts at least on 90% people. So we have to understand that it is done without any money; you can't pay for it. It’s a living process. How much did we pay for our evolution? How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers? This is your own power and in the bones sacrum that means the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone.

(Sometimes you translate so short and sometimes so big, alright)

So now to understand that what are we, we have no way out. The another great thing happens with Sahaja yoga that you achieve your present (present). We are all the time thinking about the future or the past and a thought rises and falls another thought rises and falls and we are jumping on the cuss of the thought. We cannot be in the present. The past is finished and future doesn't exist so we are not one with reality (so we are not one with reality) because that is the present; present is the reality. So when the kundalini rises, she elongates these thoughts and in between the thought there is space, the pause which is the present. Now that is the time you have no thoughts you are in the area of your own peace. That is how you are in meditation you cannot do meditation but you are in meditation. This we call as thoughtless awareness. (You..) 1:08:20 has described about it (you..). So when you become thoughtlessly aware; you become the witness of the whole play. You see the whole thing, whole world as a play. Now supposing you have problems it is like you are in the water and afraid of the waves. (You have problems and you have afraid of the waves) waves is the water as if in the water you are standing, you are afraid of the waves. But somehow if you can come in the boat; you can see the waves and if you can swim, you can jump and save others also. (If you can swim you can do it). In the same way, you see your problems, you witness your problems, you are not in it and you can solve it and also you can solve the problems of others. Its sound fantastic (it sound fantastic) but you are fantastic, you have so many powers only thing you are not aware of them. Like a candle which have not yet enlightened but when its enlightened it gives light. I give an example of a television if you take it to a remote village in India where they have never seen and if you tell them that in this box you can see films they will say it is just a box. In the same way, we too think that we are just the box but once you have put to the mains, you are fantastic, it’s all built in within you. If this instrument is not connected with the mains, it has no meaning. That’s why people have no identity, they don't know what to do with themselves because they think they have no identity. In England and America they cut their hairs, they do this they do that, just because they think they have no identity. Your identity is that you are the pure spirit and then this witness state grows within you and you become a personality with an attention which is absolutely pure. Christ has said thou shall not have adulterous eyes. I have been to all the Christians nations, I haven't see anybody with that pure attention but this pure attention when it is glanced at somebody that person also becomes peaceful and can be cured. You develop another great dimension of your attention; where you can the feel centers of others on your fingertips. so you become collectively conscious, collectively conscious, that means you can feel others on your fingertips. Now if you know how to correct your chakras and to correct the chakras of the others you solve the problem. So all these stress, strain and all that which you suffer goes away. You become an extremely dynamic personality at the same time you become extremely compassionate. Thus, a new race is created of people who are very wise, who are peaceful and who are very efficient (very wise, efficient and compassionate) and you know everything; all the subtle knowledge which was not known to you. Then you can understand Tao of Lao Tse, you can understand Buddha, Zen, Vidhitama, Christ and all other incarnations. You get connected to them and that is how you achieve this power. Above all you jump into the ocean of joy, you enjoy yourself, you never bored, you enjoy others without any lust or greed, you give up all that is destructive (all that is destructive you give up). It is like this if say I have a snake in my hand and there is darkness and I am very egoist and adamant person, (if you) if you tell me there is a snake in your hand and I say know this is not a snake, this is the rope till the snake bites me I will not give up but as soon as there is little light I will throw it away. In the same way you will be amazed that people in London gave up drugs overnight, drug addicts gave up overnight because you also become very powerful, nothing can destroy you and you cannot destroy yourself. It happens also as I told you, you jump in the ocean of joy. Joy is not like as happiness or unhappiness. It is absolute. When your ego is pampered you feel (joy) happiness, when it is punctured you feel unhappy. But in selfhood, you are all the time in joy. Now you know I am a very old woman of 71 years, first when I came to Taiwan it was like a shanty dark absolutely but today what you see is such a prosperous country but what you need is spiritual prosperity otherwise you cannot enjoy anything. I am sure tonight all of you will get your self-realization. I know also you have got questions, you must know I being travelling like this for the last 24 years and I have answered all kinds of questions, I am quite an expert; very clever but is just the mental acrobat; you have to go beyond your mind into thoughtless awareness and into the second state you call doubtless awareness where you get all the powers by which you can give realizations to people, you can do marvelous things after that and you are amazed how fantastic you are. Only thing is that you have to be very confident, all of you, that you will get your realization tonight. Its very easy - Sahaja, saha means 'with', ja means' born' so born with you is the right to get this yoga, union with the divine; Yoga is not standing on your heads and all that, that is just a we bit. It is not mental, we don't have to give up anything, don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your heads, it’s within you, is your own, this kundalini is your own mother, individual mother. She knows everything about you and she is your mother who is anxious to give you, your second birth – the self-realization. Now you might find people saying I am twice born, it’s not, it’s just a label like Christian, Hindu, Muslim - it just a label. Because you may be Hindu, Christian, Muslim anything you can commit any, any sin and these organizations that they have formed in the name of religion are just money oriented, can't you see that, they are like a (social) social institutions, social clubs or they are power oriented, (they are power oriented) none of them are spirit oriented so you shouldn't blame the religions but the people who have done this. In Sahaja yoga, you will know that all these religions were born, all the tree of spirituality, one tree. But the people took out the flowers, they took out the living flowers and now they are fighting with the dead flowers. I am sure today you all will get your self-realization but there is one thing I respect your freedom. If you don't want to have it, I cannot force on you. I would request you that in that case you should leave the hall. It will create no problem, it will not harm you and you will get your realization. It’s like the sprouting of the seed but then you have to attend our collective in the sense our programs which are follow on. You don't have to pay for that also for the whole knowledge, nothing is.. Moreover, it cannot be forced on you. Off course it is not meant for idiots and for arrogant people (also for arrogant people) you have to be humble about it, you don't have to give anything but you have to receive something. There is no obligation of anyone, it is your own power which will manifest itself. So I would request again those who want to go can go because it will take about 10 minutes, but when we are doing the process I don't want anybody to be getting up and walking off. There are 3 conditions which are very simple. First one is that you should not feel guilty at all, if you have done some mistakes just face it but why to feel guilty, it is a myth. Now if you are feeling guilty you don't know what you are doing to yourself. If you feel guilty then this centre on this side goes into problem then you get a diseases called Angina, Spondylitis (Spondylitis); lethargic organs (lethargic organs) and cervical cancer. So why to feel guilty and get these diseases here; if you have done any mistakes, you should know one thing that this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. Truth it is truth but truth is a love; it is love; it is divine love and it wants you to become spiritual as they say to enter into the kingdom of God. So please don't feel guilty at all at this moment. Then another condition is that you have to forgive everyone; now some of you may say it is difficult but whether you forgive or don't forgive what do you do? You do nothing. It is a myth but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. Now if you feel guilty this centre (Left Vishuddhi) won't open and if you don't forgive then the centre on the optic chiasma is like this absolutely constricted, if you forgive it opens. So all your life you have tortured yourself, (so) so what’s the use of remembering people who have hurt you? You better forgive all of them even without thinking about them. You just have to say I forgive because if you don't forgive you will miss the chance again of your self-realization as you have already tortured yourself. Now the third condition is that you all have to know that you all can get your self-realization tonight, whatever may be your conditioning but this condition is such that if you doubt yourself you will not get your realization. So I think these conditions are acceptable to you. Now there is something small I have to tell you that we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. You don't have to close your eyes just now. We will show you how you are going to nourish your centres, yourself. There are two powers in the left and the right, you tell them about it. Left is the power of our desire, while the kundalini is the power of pure desire, all other desires are impure because whatever we desire we are never satisfied with it. So this pure desire that is within us, of which we may not be aware; is the pure desire to be one with this all-pervading divine power. (So you have sit it) sit comfortably, not bending too much or slouching but comfortably in your seats and you people need not write just now because this is only to be done tonight. Alright, now please put your left hand towards me like this, most important thing is to get self-realization; so please put the left hand towards me like this and the right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit so now you should know when if you become the spirit you become your own guide, the light of the spirit, so you become your own master. So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Please take it down all of you. This the centre of your master created by great prophets and masters. We are working only on left hand side. Surprising you put your right hand in lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and it is the centre of pure divine knowledge. So now raise your right hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, then on your heart, then in the corner of your neck and shoulder the centre about which I have told you, turn your head towards right. Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone in general without thinking about them. Now please take your right hand on your backside of your head and push back your head, now this is the centre where you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. Now the last centre you stretch your palm like this and please put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers nicely so there is nice pressure on your scalp. Now please take down your head, put down your head, put down, very important.

Now move the scalp seven times slowly, seven times slowly, clockwise. Please put down your head, put down, put down otherwise you could not.. Now press it hard, push back your fingers and move it very, very slowly clockwise. Now, put down put down, put down. Now that’s all we have to do. Now please your feet apart from each other because these are two powers and left hand towards me and (be) I would say pleasantly placed yourself, pleasantly placed not angrily but pleasantly placed yourself. Alright, now put the left hand like this and the right hand on the heart, you can take out your glasses it will help you a lot take out your glasses and you have to close your eyes now and please don't open the eyes till I tell you, don't say any mantras anything, no prayer nothing just leave your attention free, do not concentrate it anywhere, the kundalini will look after it. In the heart resides the spirit, so you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself three times in your heart, please ask three times if you want you can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji. Now the question is Mother, Am I the spirit? Please ask this question three times in your heart, Mother, Am I the spirit? I have told you if you are the spirit you become your master so please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Now here ask a question, fundamental question about yourself three times again, ask a question Mother, Am I my own master?' Alright, I already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here ask six times Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge, six times, because this centre has got six petals; as soon as you ask for pure knowledge the kundalini rises. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, we have to open all these centres with our full self-faith or you can call it the confidence. Here you have to say ten times with your full confidence, full confidence. Mother, I am my own master. Please say it with full confidence. I have already told you at the very outset that the truth is you are the pure spirit so please raise your right hand on top of your heart and again say it will full confidence 12 times Mother, I am the pure spirit. This divine power is the ocean of knowledge and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and it can resolve all your mistakes. So forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and here you have to say, please turn your head to your right, here you have to say with self-confidence 16 times Mother, I am not guilty at all. Alright, I have already told you whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. At this moment, please forgive all them without thinking about in general. So now please put your hand on your forehead across and please put down your head, please put down your head, please raise your hand to your forehead and please put down your head. Here we don't have to say it how many times but from your heart, Mother, I forgive everyone in general, say it from your heart. You have to ask forgiveness from the divine power without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction. Now please take your right hand on backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible, here you have to say, Oh divine power if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me. Say it from your heart not how many times. Alright, now please stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers please so that there is a good pressure on your scalp, now please (please) bend your head, again I have to tell you that I cannot force self-realization on you so you have to ask seven times, ' Mother please give me self-realization' when you are moving your hand seven times clockwise slowly. Please put down your head please. Please take down your hands open your eyes, now put your hands towards me, higher. Now put the right hand towards me and put down the head and see with left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like sensation is coming out of your fontanel bone area. Bend your heads, bend your heads otherwise. Now please put your left hand towards me and now bend your head and see for yourself there is a cool or hot breeze like sensation is coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now once again, please try with the right hand now put down your head, please put down your head, some people get it far away, some people get it close; tell them; and if you are getting hot means you have not forgiven, so please forgive. Alright, now please put both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head, here ask one of the three questions 3 times in your heart, Mother, Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?, Mother, Is this the formless divine love? or Mother, Is this the Paramchaitanya? Ask any one of these questions 3 times. Now please put down your hands, put your hands towards me like this and watch me without thinking. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their hands, on their fingertips or out of their fontanel bone area please raise both your hands. (Again you tell them they didn't hear you). May God bless you. You all have felt it most of you, some have not felt doesn’t matter. (Again again ask them to raise their hands all those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their hands, on fingertips or on the fontanel bone again, both the hands) most of them. Some of you have not felt doesn't matter. Now only thing is that you all have to come to the collective. Now it has just sprouted, any nail which is cut cannot grow (nail which is cut cannot grow, cut from the body. nail nail, tell him any nail that is cut cannot grow from the body if it is cut, isn't it?) So as you have become now part and parcel of the whole, you should grow collectively. You can also feel the cool breeze in (the) your neighbour’s head also if they have got it. Here not here, here. So you all have to come to the collective meeting and grow and those who haven't got also will grow. May be you have not forgiven, otherwise you won't grow, I will be here every year, I hope to see you grow like great trees of spirituality. May God bless you. And the mantra is enjoy yourself.

You have to announce now, we are going to announce where they will have the follow ups so please be seated for one minute more.

Thank you very much. Thank You.
