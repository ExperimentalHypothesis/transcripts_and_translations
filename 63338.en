22-December-1992, What is Sahaja Dharma, Evening Program Before Christmas Eve, Ganpatipule, India

Shri Mataji: I was so overwhelmed [long applause]. By seeing how you all love Me – that I thought I may not be able to speak anything today. As you know, Sahaja Yoga is nothing but love of God. And if you feel that love of God, then you are Sahaja Yogis. I don’t have to tell you anything more. It’s so deepening, it’s so subtle, it’s so nourishing. It plays such beautiful tunes and beautiful ragas. Within yourself. It has just opened a new dimension into your lives. And I am so very happy to see so many of you settled down there. Like the North Pole. And nothing can budge you out of it. Is a very big thing.

To know yourself is the biggest thing. But to know your Self and to have the knowledge about It is the highest. And so of many of you are, I have seen – fifty-five nations before Me. I think My work is done forever.

The music – I don’t know how to thank him because he is also My son. And the way he has accepted Sahaja Yoga is very, very remarkable. I have never known any artist that highly placed in spirituality. So sensitive to pure knowledge and to reality. Surprising one. Must be lots of punyas in his lives, he must have done. So many artists have come. Of course, they have tremendous respect for Me. They have felt the vibrations. Do all that. But this kind of a complete immersion to the joy of Reality is seen here. I am very happy, and I wish so many artists – not only from India; from all over the world – get it.

Because that is the source of creativity. That is the source of understanding. Of your audience. Of people, with whom you have to have a rapport. And everlasting feeling of oneness with the rest. Who are your audience, become as if they are singing with you. It’s such a beautiful feeling of joy that cannot be described in words. But I know how you were feeling it when you were singing it and how everyone was appreciating it.

[The] appreciation part is something so extraordinary. Normally among artists, there are always jealousies, competitions. But I found today that people from Nagpur, who had composed the same song, were enjoying him so much and appreciating him so much. And they said he is such a heavenly singer. This is not possible. When we are on a mundane level of materialism. There we only think of how to outwit another person. A big competition is there.

But in this realm of divinity, everything that other does, we enjoy. I have seen people getting jealous of each other. If Sahaja Yogi achieves something, another Sahaja Yogi will tell Me, ‘Mother, he is a tapasvi (devoted). You don’t know; he is a tapasvi’. Never feel jealous. This is something very surprising that there is no competition, even in Sahaja Yoga. If somebody says, ‘I had such an experience’, they will go on telling, ‘Oh, he had such an experience’. But nobody feels jealous about it.

This is such a big thing to show that you have really surrendered your ego in this ocean of beautiful joy. Ego is the only problem which will stop you from sitting on that position on which you are placed now.

That is just like the Meru, the great mountain which was used for the first churning. That position – once you have – in Marathi we call it ‘adhalapath’.  In Hindi we call it ‘atalapath’. In English [aside, to someone in Hindi – what is it called?]

Sahaja Yogi: Unshakeable.

Shri Mataji: Unshakeable. Or permanent. That position now you have achieved. And nothing can deter it. It’s such a great thing to see. I mean, I was supposed to be sick. Supposed. [Yogis laugh and applaud]. It’s a drama. It’s a drama. But I saw you people just fixed onto it. And this is something you should never lose. So be careful about ego and conditionings. If you can get rid of it completely, you can never be shaken up.

I know there are many Sahaja Yogis who are here, whom I can say they are all like that. But maybe there are some on the periphery. After listening to this music, you can see how such a difficult raga like Marwa – you know, normally, I think, in India very few like Marwa. I am of course, very much fond of it. And when he said he would sing Marwa, I don’t know – what people are going to enjoy or not. It’s a very, very subtle raga. And you all enjoyed it. Very surprisingly – you don’t know anything about Indian music. Nothing of the kind. And how you enjoyed it.

Even North Indians are not so fond of classical music as such. From cinema music to this music. To enjoy means that your Spirit is throwing light. Because this is the music of the Spirit. Of the Omkara. And that’s what, without understanding any theory about it, or any ragas or any effects, or any permutations and combinations, you are just enjoying. That’s all. You are in thoughtless awareness. I am so enamoured to see that the way you people have taken to your Sahaja Yoga so well.

I don’t know how to again thank all the people who have accompanied you. They all seem to be swimming in the same ocean of joy. It was wonderful. Very much thankful to you. I have been listening to you throughout when I was in Vashi. And he has made some beautiful tapes. And I would like somebody to make nice copies and sell them and give that money to him. And not to Sahaja Yoga. [applause].

So, another thing I wanted to tell you about our programming. I thought, best thing would be to start a program from 5 to 8 [pm] for Sahaja Yogis. There are many who have very good dramas. Many who have brought many beautiful dancing. Some who want to sing. So we could have from 5 to 8, such programs organised. Those who want to give programs should give names to Jaykar who is organising it.

Secondly, I have been telling people that after seeing the kind of football, where you have to kick the ball and your ego develops, which creates such problems. Then, you have other horrible ones like rugby. I mean, that must be for the wrestlers only. All such games he was describing. I was feeling in My heart – what about the play of Shri Krishna? Simple things. In India, we have got games where there is no competition at all. We play such games without any bat or ball or any accessories. So many games are there; tomorrow I am going to write them down. And I think all of you should learn these games. And can be played by ladies or men equally well. And you can play it in the moonlight; is the best time to play. [applause]

In India, you can find a lot of moonlight. I don’t know, in other countries, say – rather difficult to see the moon there. So, these games – I will write them down one by one, and I will tell them. And I hope you will learn it. Some time you should find out; I don’t know when you will find the time. For these games also, in the morning time sometime. Because these are very interesting games, and you will like it. Where you really don’t need any accessories, no referee, nothing. Just it works automatically. And I think we should give up all these horrible games where people only become hooligans and horribly violent.

There’s another problem in this country now, started about Mister Babur. He is called a ‘Baboor’. His so-called mosque. How – I mean, I know that it is Rama janmabhoomi (birthplace of Shri Rama), no doubt. And I told all the leaders, it is Rama Janmabhoomi – those who came to see Me. But the law in India is funny; that this is historical. Even if they have found out, there, the thing written down it is Rama Janmabhoomi. They have found out all things. Still, the law is that perhaps any land that belongs twelve or fifteen years to somebody becomes his own. Very good idea. We should come and occupy some land here, you see [yogis laugh and applaud].

So, though it is Rama Janmabhoomi, they are not going to accept it. But the Muslims must understand. That if they go on like this, there will be always trouble for them. On the contrary, they should join hands with Hindus. Now, for these forty-four years, poor things have been kept so poor that extremely poor people; they are the poorest.

I mean you see, now we have a great artist here sitting. I met one Muslim artist who is a very good singer also. He is living in a small room, sixteen by eight, with five members. And he is such a mess. Now, he doesn’t know what to do with himself, so he has gone to Dubai or someplace. But they don’t understand classical music, you see. I don’t think anybody understands. They know only Bhairava raga and they sing morning till evening. They don’t know much about it. So I don’t know what this man is going to do there. But whatever it is, he has run away.

So the condition of these artists; there are so many artists. Among Muslims also, there was one fellow. Came from Nagpur and I started with him, a drama centre. Poor man, I was surprised he had eight children. And he didn’t have any food to eat. Such a great artist. Mr Khan was his name. Poor man, then he died. Of tuberculosis. And I don’t know what has happened to his children. I was looking after them till I went to England.

There are so many Muslims who are in such a wretched condition. There are very few who have become artists. Say, in the cinema or all that. So they are earning something. Or there are some who are looked after by the Congresswallas or Janata Party or some party or something [political parties in India]. And they are not bothered to find out as to what is wrong with the Muslims. If you go to any Muslim community, really, you will have such compassion. And such love. While Hindus have progressed. And they have been kept aloof all the time, aloof all the time. And now, the condition that they are in is the worst of all.

I mean, when you read this has happened [most likely, the Babri masjid demolition in December 1992], so many were killed and all that. They should really come forward and say, ‘We don’t want that masjid or anything. Throw it away.’ And one should not also kill. What is the need to kill these poor people; already finished they are. So in both ways, one has to understand. Though it is Rama Janmabhoomi – but I told all the leaders clearly – ‘Even if you have Ram Mandir, you cannot have Rama Rajya [an ideal society]. You have to have first Rama Rajya.’

How? First of all, you should give them Sahaja Yoga. [applause]. And the leaders who are interested think that it is slow work, Sahaja Yoga is. And this slow work won’t work out. But what is the use of having Rama’s mandir also? Because there are so many temples. But what are you doing for the public?

The Hindus are becoming so westernised. You have no idea as to how westernised they are. In Pune, I see any Brahmin woman – she has cut her hair; she is wearing goggles, sleeveless blouses. She is moving about in some sort of a Honda or something. You see from behind; you see from the front – she has to be a Brahmin. Has to be a Brahmin woman. In the club, if you go – all the Brahmin women are drinking. Now what do you say to this kind of a Hindu people?

All this has to be brought to the culture of Sahaja. I don’t say Sahaja culture is Hindu by any chance. But it has the basis in the Indian scriptures. We have to admit that. There is nothing wrong. When we are learning the science from the West, why not they learn this science? This is the meta-science. Sahaj Yoga is the meta-science. And Indians are just proud about their past, but they haven’t imbibed anything. So it’s just the same. Just the same.

Only Sahaja Yoga is the solution. And I hope the way this time you had the tour on your own and so many people got realisation. Again this country, if it takes to Sahaja Yoga – Maharashtra has been a very great disappointment I must say. I worked very hard in Maharashtra. But Maharashtra is known to be a quarrelsome country. They are known to be that ‘bhaubandhki paachvila pujaliye’ [Marathi idiom loosely meaning becoming united is a constant problem].  Fight, fight, fight. This one. All the time they are complaining about this and that.  In Sahaja Yoga, if you cannot get over this ancient disease, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

In every centre, there is such an ego and such a fight. It’s impossible to understand what these people are going to go. They cannot go further. So, though Maharashtra has been a great country; we have got lots of great, great saints here – like Gyanadeva, like Ramadasa, Tukarama – so many of them. Like Namadeva, so many. But the people, I don’t know, they are still very quarrelsome. So, for all the Maharashtrian Sahaja Yogis, it is important to see that you give up your fighting capacity. You have the greatest heritage as far as spirituality is concerned.

Sahaja Yoga was practiced only in Maharashtra since long. All the Nathpanthis existed only in Maharashtra. All the great literature on Sahaja is in Maharashtra.

Even Namadeva was so much appreciated by Nanak Saheb, that He put his verses and that of his maid servant, Janabai, into Granth Sahib. But these Maharashtrians of today – I don’t know, from the Peshwai it is lost – they are such fighting cocks. That I don’t know what to do with it. That’s why this time, I am not going to Maharashtra. Only to Ganpatipule, I have come. I would not say that all of them are quarreling. But some of them are quarreling and creating such problems – that’s not proper.

This is the punyabhoomi. Kundalini of the whole universe is in this Maharashtra. That’s why even Shri Rama had to take His shoes to walk on this holy land, pavitrabhoomi. And what are we doing?  So, I have to request all the Maharashtrians to decide and take a vow. That we should develop our collectivity better. And we give up all our fighting.

On the contrary, I never had any hopes from the North Indians, because they had such a Muslim influence on them. On the contrary, they have turned out to be so great. And not only that – very deep, very subtle. And have taken to Sahaja Yoga in every way; they have given up all that nonsense they used to do. So it’s very surprising.

Maharashtra has all the background, all the history, all the traditions. And the language. Nothing like the Marathi language. All these subtle things are really expressed in Marathi language. But now the people are using Marathi language; I don’t know what sort of language they are using. So the dignity of the language is also lost. So specially, I have to request all the Maharashtrians to take a vow, that we will not try to show off. And we will not have our ego. Such a stupid ego they have, that it has no meaning at all. It doesn’t work out.

In Sahaja Yoga, if you are still carrying that load on your head, you are putting one foot in the mouth of the crocodile and one foot on the beautiful Sahaja Yoga ship we have. So come out of that. Come out of petty, small differences. Support everyone. And this is possible if jealousies are finished. ‘This is my land, this is my centre, this is my this’ – all this ‘my’ has to go away. I am telling you this in the beginning only because I would like you to introspect yourself when you meditate.

Meditation doesn’t mean, ‘Mother, we will do everything’. It doesn’t mean that at all. Introspection. Russians are very introspective. All the Eastern Bloc is very introspective. So they are just beautiful people there. You go anywhere, there are twenty-two thousand or sixteen thousand. It’s remarkable. So what you need is introspection, and this stupid ego has to be [unclear].

Today they thought I won’t be able to speak. But once I start speaking to you, I start speaking. [Yogis applaud]. From tomorrow, whatever is the program, please keep it up. You have come here on a pilgrimage. Remember that. Not for enjoyment but pilgrimage. Even music is a pilgrimage. Everything is a pilgrimage. So one should try to do meditation in an introspective way. One should try to really, fully concentrate, dedicate, and surrender to your ascent. Once you are established, I have no problems. But till you are established there is a problem.

So be careful. That those who think they are – some people you ask them, they will say, ‘like this’. If you are like this, you better go back. Or settle down. There is no compromise. You have to settle down on your Sahaja seat. I have praised the North Indians very much and I request them not be – in Marathi it is said, ‘harbharachya zadavar chadhu naka’. Meaning you should not get unnecessarily pampered. There is so much to be also learned from Maharashtrians. Their discipline. They know so much about everything.

The whole society is built up with different, different things beautiful things. Except for agurus, kugurus [false gurus] – all kinds of too many things you have, also in the North. But they take them too seriously and that’s why there have been problems. So, one has to take everything in a proper way – with understanding and dignity. Self-respect. That we are all Sahaja Yogis, and we have to be Sahaja Yogis.

We have to be established as Sahaja Yogis. And all the vidya he has asked for; I have given him.  You know all the vidyas. All the subtle vidyas. Now if you also want Me to write it down, ‘a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h’, I will write it down. But you all know the chakras, you know how to awaken, you know everything. Nothing is to be told to you as such. So you have all the vidya. But to do the vidya, the instrument has to be very adaptable, efficient.

Now, this time in Ganpatipule, we should use all these events, all these festivities, and all this collectivity to improve our instrument. I bless you all, all of you, very happy to see you again. And I am feeling absolutely alright. [Yogis applaud. Chants of Shri Mataji ki Jai].

May God bless you all.
