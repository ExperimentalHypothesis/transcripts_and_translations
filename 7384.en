Letter to Delhi Sahaja Yogis, London, May 1978.

Dear Sahaj Yogis of Delhi

Your loving letters put me in the same plight as afterworship, every pore of the body oozes out the chaitanya. It gives megreat pleasure to learn that you all are engrossed in your sadhana.A mother only wishes dear children should stand on their own and thather acquire their own wealth. So long as this dies not happen, oulife will have no fulfillment inspite of (in the midst) all achievments.No Sadhana becomes possible without turning within (inward) weshould speak of only that in which lies our ultimate well being andpiety. What else is there to achieve in the human life except God?Sahaj Yoga is an unparalleled discovery. The entire humanitywill have to be aquainted with Sahaj Yoga in the same manner as ascientific invention is made known to all, only an individual makesan invention but he extends its benefits to the entire mankind. Thisis the way of man. Another thing is that an inventor can work only onthe basis of the knowledge accumulated in the past. Similarly the dayhas now come when, after several past revelation man has been broughtwithin the horizons of his goal. But when we enter this beautifulshrine we should not forgot those steps which have led us to it. Thebuilder of those steps which have led us to it. The builder ofthose steps and the maker of this shrine are one and the same.When we say God is one it does not mean that he is aninanimate monolith like the Govardhan mountain. The one who is thesource of life cannot be lifeless. When a human being assumes variousroles for different function such as mother, sister, brother &father, what imnumerable manifestation the God must be living.God has revealed to us all the things so that we take toworship & meditation. In the west the people have ample free time. Itis on account of this excessive free time that people get completelybored with their empty life and commit suicide. These days so manypeople are taking recourse to self annihilation. But through SahajYoga they can find the meaning of life. Man can get contentment onlyin the perfection of life. Because no one really dies. Only theearthing sheath of the human being is cast away as we cut out ournails. All the rest remains. The unsatisfied should go to the worldof the dead and wander as spirits making the lives of themselves andothers miserable. One should, therefore, obtain the satiety of SahajYoga and should commend it so that it grows.What is unconscious, you know well and you are benefited byit. But you do not yet full trust it. It feels offended by this lackof faith and its attention is diverted from you. Therefore rejoicein excellent revelation and sing into praise. There lies your good.Who waxes ignorant even after knowing and who becomes blind even afterseeing will remain deprived of God's grace from birth to birth. Godise pleased with the innocence of his children not with theircleverness. He knows there all. Therefore again & again, I say "growin your inwardliness."Ever remembering youMOTHER NIRMALA
