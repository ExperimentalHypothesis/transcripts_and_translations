Talk to yogis (with French translation). Bramham Court Ashram, London (England), 3 November 1981.

(ShriMataji is talking to a yogini) The tape about how to meditate, that is important. How to meditate and that day I… did you hear my tape about it “How to meditate”. Now…has to translate? [Yogini speaking] But you took the tape with you? so you tell them how to meditate is important, and… quieten yourself within, that is very important, is to first of all quieten yourself, your thoughts.
So how thru breathing a Sahaja Yogi can stop his thoughts, thru controlling the breathing. Now the thing is one has to know that now you are realized souls, first thing….one has to actually believe it, and if you are that then there are many things which must change and the one thing we have to believe with full confidence that we are now transformed. Now translate it to them.
(Yogini starts to translate in French language)

Now if you become aware of it, then you will know that you have got power to transform yourself as well as transform others.
So you must have faith, now faith doesn’t mean blind faith, but faith based on your own experience.
Now once you realize that whatever you want or think you can do, that your relationship with the Divine is not imaginary anymore, but is actual and that Divine is dynamic, it understands and it acts, it is much easier to change.
Now, this faith is not yet established in many Sahaja Yogis in the West. If this faith could be established by even logical conclusions, then you can start experimenting with yourself. And you will be amazed how much powers you have got. It is a vicious circle. If you do not practice what you have got, you lose it and you become definite and you then don’t practice and then you become more definite, then you become just like any other ordinary human being.
So one should know you have powers that every negative should be afraid of you. Even your presence can frighten them, because Spirit is insurmountable, that is one thing that people do not know that you cannot be overcome, because it has its own freedom, of its own. If this faith becomes absolutely one with your being, you just become compassion, then you know how to love others, and respect others, and respect the human dignity; but this happens at a later state, at a higher stage, more in the western society.
You see first they want to know how much they can aggress others, or how many people they can impress others, or how much they can gain themselves. But one should know that it is a power that is compassion, that is love, that is forgiveness, and that is one should achieve how many people you can love and how many people you can bring together. How many things you can give away. How many things you can throw away. How much you have got rid of your fixations and your - what you can say that, your sort of self consciousness, you see - how much you can get rid of your self consciousness.
All this vanity just drops out, should drop out. Because vanity is the biggest barrier. And you yourself become your own reflection, your own reflector, and you can see clearly what you are in Sahaja Yoga, and what you were and what you have to be. And then you can ascend with the help of your love for your Mother, and it happens that you can grow very fast.
And one thing you must remember that you are made into a lamp. So you don’t have to anymore seek, just grow your light to others. So in one way you increase your light so that you help yourself, and just to help others. Your growth has no meaning if it cannot help others.

Now, for example, if you put the fire on, the fire does not burn itself, it burns others; also the fire gives light. Now you are the fire, you are the light and you are the controller of fire or the light. You are the one who can become, if you want to, with the fire or the light. You have power to become whatever you like. When it is necessary to be fire you have to be fire, when you have to become the light you have to become the light. But it is better to try to become light first, then become fire.
Even the fire that burns is of no use, none likes it; but if you can become the fire that cooks and nourishes others, digest the food - in the sense that it helps to cook and make the food so must that it become digestible. If you become that good, then it is definitely useful.
But the fire that burns you have been, that you must give up, you must become the fire that cooks, because you are changed and in that change you have achieved the power to use this fire for cooking food for others. Everything that you had so far was used for a wrong purpose, for the destructive side, for the negative.
Now the same thing after enlightenment is for the betterment, for the wellbeing, for the sweet feelings, nourishing support of others, because it is enlightenment, like the light illumines the road and darkness is dispelled, you are no more confused, you know where exactly you have to go, you get discrete. Discretion becomes part and parcel of your being, so enlightenment gives you an absolute discretion.

Now, for example, appreciation of art. You start appreciating any art which gives you vibrations.
Now in the West the appreaciation of art comes that you see there is a big space left and […] somewhere, they cannot understand and appreciate the exuberance of joy, of the common [...] people. Everything has to be such that one can write a book on that, everything that creates thought.
On the contrary art is such it should stop your thoughts. So this is what one should understand that when you have certain ideas about art, they come also from your own fixations, your own education. Education, most of it, is ego-pampering which comes from ego-maniacs: they say ‘this is right this is right this is good’, but they don’t teach you how to enjoy spontaneously.
So the spontaneous appreciation of something in art is not what you certify with your ego or some people think they have a power by which they can certify; but is the sensitivity that makes you enjoy the creation of that art.
Now, for example, in the West I feel they like most of the art which is really like beggars art I would say. For example, I went to buy the tiles and the most expensive were just like beggar’s style: Worn out, colorless, insipid; and that they said is the most elite. The trouble is their ego makes them so conscious that they want to hide their ego, so they feel shy to express their exuberance or their thankfulness to God. Because if you say you are happy, then you have to thank God for that. And they do not want to thank God. So they want to live like miserable beggars, just to overcome their ego.

The sign of health is exuberance.
Then in art they start showing [..] and dirty filthy things absolutely filth, I mean any saintly person would vomit.
So they show if not of beggaring, they show what you call the filth and the dirt. If you go to hell, you will get all of these there directly, all these. I mean you can live in the gutter there it is just the same, the worm in the gutter. Sometimes I feel they are practicing if they are going to hell, how to be insensitive, because they will have to face this filth there.
And that is why one has to cut off these things. It is like somebody eating the filth and saying "what’s wrong?" But if you ask "why do you do it?" So he can say that of course I have to go to hell, so I must practice I may have to eat it all my life. So such a negative person if you ask "Why you want to go to hell?" He says "That is the only solution for me, I am waiting for it".
So, gradually, they are becoming not only animals, but some fear worms those who have lost the sensitivity against [..]. And then when they will go to hell they will say !why should we go to hell?"

But there is no compromise. I must tell you very frankly. There is no compromise, no grace there, no compassion, but very hard judgment, so we should prepare ourselves in such a way that we should enter into the Kingdom of heaven and should not be unsettled. We should try to become the Will of God and not our own will. Then the joy will be complete. Otherwise […] incomplete joy in life, it is just like playing games. But that time we cannot play games you see when we are judged, not only but you have to get your positions as sahaja yogis in the Kingdom of God. But you have to become the instruments, the great instruments of God. So you are not entering into the Kingdom of God to be some part benchers or sitting in the corner somewhere, but you have to take positions and you have to do it quick. If you still have desires "I want this I want that", and you weep for that, it will not work out. And if you have still fears, still it will bring you down.

You must change your facing. Now you are facing the public. First you were a part of the public, now you are facing the public, so you have to change your image outside and inside, otherwise you are neither here nor there. This is the problem with sahaja yogis, that they do not understand that there is no way you can return back in a position where you can say that I am not realized. But now you are realized and you have no excuse: you must grow, you must become what you have been given, otherwise you will be thrown away, just like rejected […] cannot be sold any more.

So in Sahaja Yoga there is a tremendous happening that is taking place, as if I have put you in the furnace and I am working out everything that is possible under the sun and you should come out in really flying colors. But if you do not accept your position, you may fail. It is your freedom which is also enlightened and you can go faster to hell than you could go before. So it is essential that you calm down and be peaceful and take your position.
Those who are frightened, who are diffident must change. Those who are aggressive, hot tempered must change. Ego oriented must change. Superego oriented must change. Come in the center, not go from one extreme to another extreme. You have to become universal, universal personality.

Like I was getting very good tiles for the same price as marble - maybe the marble was not, may not be such an expensive marble - but the tile and the marble had the same price. So if I buy the tile, some may like, the value of tile maybe like say French, I mean some French, because they agree - they must find out faults, but still if there are ten French, two or three may like a particular tile, but marble everybody will like, because it is marble. They will not see the value, but they say ‘it is marble’. What is the difference? One is spontaneous from God, whether it is the same value or this is all human beings. Everybody who wants to see will not see the value, but will see it is marble. So whatever is spontaneous, which is natural from God it has its own intrinsic value, it does not change with different countries, different whims or different periods of time. It is eternal.

So if you do something spontaneous, it cannot be appreciated to them, because artists were never appreciated when they lived; but when they died they were appreciated, after many years. Same about the saints. But now you have so many saints in this world that they can appreciate saints.
But are we appreciating each other? Are we understanding that we are all saints nobody is higher or lower. If the saints cannot appreciates saints, then who else is going to appreciate. Because you are saints, you are a creation of spontaneity of your Mother. Everyone is a piece of art, is so beautiful. We do not actually appreciate ourselves to begin with. We only appreciate few people, "I like this and I don’t like that", but every piece is a source of joy.
If you start appreciating each other, then I have some hopes that the spontaneity is being appreciated, that human beings have become eternal beings. They have sensitivity for eternal things and not for temporary things. Like the marble has an eternal value, the Spirit has the eternal value. But you should be able to feel that eternity, that enjoy that eternity. This is what it is, we are eternal life in the eternal life, we have entered into the eternal life, and only the things that are spontaneous have eternal life, everything else perishes. If you deal with anything with temporary skills you are not yet a sahaja yogi, no doubt about it. So one has to develop that sensitivity that does not come from your rationality and your so called education and so called reasoning. But only thru surrendering, thru surrendering to spontaneity.

I hope people will break their barriers of ego in the west and enjoy the eternity. Once you start doing that, you will get more and more sahaja yogis. Because those who are coming are not so sensitive and the ones who are there in charge are also not so sensitive, so every waves that comes in returns back, it does not absorb, or it is not absorbed; that is how in Sahaja Yoga one has to grow very fast if you have to attract other people, because spontaneity is the only thing that is the capital we have got. We have no other capital to catch. Only this spontaneous love, other fake people have got money and other superficial things to attract, we have only this. This has to grow.

May God bless you all.

Now if you have any question, you can ask.

Question: What are the characteristics of Leo?

Shri Mataji: Leo is a very generous man. He has a heart of lion. It can face difficulties and can be very dignified. You see a lion or a tiger both are kings of the forest. And in the area where lions live, tigers cant live. I mean climatically, because tigers like colder areas and lions like the hot areas. So both have the same characteristics of a king.
First of all they will eat when they have to eat, they do not eat like beggars, all the time, being afraid whether they will get it tomorrow or not. Like a beggar will gobble everything you see whenever he gets a chance, because he is not sure about the future. And they will kill the animals, particular animals only which they have to overpower.
For a lion will not eat a rabbit, never. But only the one that he can overpower, for which he has to struggle which has to own. And the killed he will eat, with dignity. And he is very frugal in his eating and leaves most of the kill for others, to enjoy. And it will leave that spot and go away. And he makes others quite fearless so that they should not feel embarrassed how to eat in the presence of the king.
They are very wonderful animals, both of them. And when a tiger or a lion dies in a forest, everyone weeps, becomes a silent place, because their king has died. They want that he must eat also and they do not mind if a tiger kills an animal. And he is very fatherly and such he is a very good husband. He is not undignified in married life also. He is not like a stupid dog runs after every bitch. He lives with lioness only. They are very dignified couple and they know the value of their own children and they bring them up as lions.
But a lion, as a human being, could be dangerous also, if he does not allow his qualities of lion humanized. Because lion has long nails you see. So for human being where he could be little abrupt, that he may do something that may disturb people or he may hurt without his knowledge and he may also sort of assert pressure, put a pressure or create jealousies.
So one has to be careful because of his propensity and his personality. He should not make others […] and frightened. In the nature animals are spontaneous. A lion behave like a lion; he cannot behave like a scorpion or like a snake. But a human being can be everything.
So if you go to the spontaneity of your own character, then you can develop a personality which is supporting your growth. But if you get enveloped or pulled down or you can say engulfed by your own sign (zodiac), then you cannot become a sahaja yogi. Because after realization you are becoming universal and none of your sign really hold you back, but give you a special colour in the cosmos. It should never create any discord, it should give you concord, that it is good.
The signs drop out, because Spirit is not bound by any sign. No stars, nothing can bound it, so it maybe a person who is a leo may not progress so much as a person who is Gemini. It depends on you desire to be the Spirit.
He is like Kartykeya and Ganesha having a bid from their Mother saying that She is giving a price to the person who is going around the Mother earth. So who goes around the Mother earth first. Now Kartykeya has a vahana which is, you know, a very fast moving bird, that is peacock whoch can fly; while poor Ganesha has only the little mouse. So Ganesha is the one who catches the Principle and he says that "Nobody is greater than my Mother. So if I go around my mother only three times I’ll be […]". So he went around his Mother only and while Kartykeya was flying. And when he came back, he found already Ganesha has got the present.

So when you become the essence, you become the reality and then all unreal things like your signs, everything dropout.
Say a flower becomes the fragrance, then fragrance is what flower is, but you do not see the flower anymore, you just feel the fragrance. So you have to go to the essence of everything. That is what people do not understand. Is called as Tattwa, the principle. If you become the principle then nothing is as important. Whatever may be your sign. I have seen people with very good sign just go down like that. I have known of some leos who were very ego oriented, some aries who were very good at organizing and they just went straight down; and some simple people who were not very much great according to their horoscopes, they have become very great sahaja yogis. So do not depend on your sign so much, you can get ego orientation or depression. Both are against Sahaja Yoga. Allright?

Question: What do you think about dogs?

Shri Mataji: Good, good. Dog is very good. Dog is a disciple and he knows his guru. He knows every bit of his guru. All the deities inside the guru. Every mood, everything. But that knowledge it gains. It knows what pleases the guru, and as soon as the guru comes home, he will express all his joy. He will give up everything and run to […],expressing the joy. So many things one has to learm from a dog. They are wonderful things, they are beautiful. You better keep the dog.

I have a dog too. It is with my daughter now. When I go to India, when I go to my daughter’s place I wear a very ordinary saree, because I know as soon as he hears my voice, he come jumping and jump all over me, lick me and also show his anger because I have left him, and eyes will have tears, even he may tear my saree; and when I am coming and filling my bag, then it goes and sits and sulks, and does not eat food for eight days. I mean I go every second year but he is not forgotten even my voice.
All dogs now for his species is outlet, his name is Deepak, means the light. He is absolutely white, is a spitz style, from Germarny that kind, but it is a Japanese dog, big for his own breed, I have a fotograph somewhere.
Dogs have a capacity to love. I have taught this dog how to do puja, he use to touch my feet and he would never lick my feet, he will lick my saree but not my feet. And he knows how to use […] all such things he knows. You can teach him so many things. He is used to discriminate even the footsteps of every person in the house. And he never liked nudity of any kind. One Yugoslav lady came with a short, not very short with a frock and legs showing and he started barking at her, she did not […] So I have to give a towel to cover her legs, while she was talking to me.
And also these religions in India, we have dotis, and if they show their knees… you must cover below your knees for him. If he would have come to France, I am sure he would have gone mad. Even in a painting if he saw the legs […] he would bark to the painting, and he could not bear any sleevless, or these translucent dress people wear. And he was Japanese actually, but he was very particular and very kind to children.
So many things they have. In India they say they have eighteen paws of something, the number of paws, then he is a saint. They have sixteen normally, but if they have eighteen nails means they are saints, something like that, some sort of myth. But my dog has the vibrations and such a sense of respect and protocol. And he himself you know, if anything is given to him with love he would eat otherwise he will not. He’s the vehicle of guru tattwa the master, so the disciples are the vehicle of a guru.You have to be ableto to bear my power otherwise my powers are useless.

Question: How to develop self-confidence without developing ego.

Shri Mataji: In Sahaja Yoga you do not rationalize anything and you do not think about it, that you work it out. And the work is so simple that people really don’t take to it. Like yesterday I received a letter from Australia that two people felt that they were getting heart attack. So they didn’t know what to do. So they put my shoes on top of their heads. And they got alright. It’s a fact. So in Sahaja Yoga whatever is to be done it’s not to be done mentally, that’s one thing people don’t realize. Everything we do mentally. But what you have to do is to feel your vibrations on the photograph. You may think you are diffident, you may not be. You may think you have ego, you may not be. So now you see on the photograph itself. Forget about judging yourself mentally. Mentally. Mentally, forget. Put your left hand towards the photograph. See if there are vibrations coming in. Then put your right hand towards the photograph. See if the vibrations are coming in. Now if in both the hands the vibrations are the same, you are in the center. If there is disparity then you adjust it, just by giving a bandhan. As if your body, yourself has become a tool into your hands. Like all this is dead and you are the living master and you know how to screw what, screw to turn. By all this[…] by Nirmala Vidya you become the Spirit, and then you don’t think. All these vidyas may look very serious sometimes. But it helps, it definitely help. Definitely works. And for that reason you must become experts in Nirmala Vidya. Then you ou don’t become ego or superego, you become the Spirit. All right? The science of divine laws. Because reality, the living reality is your power. And ego and superego are myths, are dead things So you know how to manage. You become separated from yourself and you know how to allright “come along it’s ego all right go down, now you come…now do it like that put right... it’s like that. Like she’s catching on the right vishuddi, she just put her hand there, not putting aside, you don’t feel condemned about it. It’s all made easy and simple. Without difficult […]. Actually children are very simple. My granddaughter she was hardly two years and then when we went to the airport she was very busy like this like this like this, and she was doing it [bandhan] very fast, so my daughter asked ‘what are you doing?’ So she said I’m tying this airport. She’s always busy. And as a child of three years she use to draw the all of Bombay with one pencil really […]. My daughter said ‘but how can you do it with one line’ so she said ‘only one line passes thru all of them’. The essence you see. She was hardly three years. Look at this Aniky, she is at my feet as if children are near the chocolate. Look at Olympia [laugh] she’s [watching Me] because she has a little liver problem. And all the children want to be there to wash My Feet and then they take out all your agya problem. For them It’s all a play. Nirmala Vydia is a play for them because they are spirit. There is nothing so serious. French are unnecessarily so serious. What have they achieved out of their seriousness. […] Filth. There is nothing to be serious about. But out of the mud only the lotus is born. Is complete there. That’s how this lotus has to come. And Sahaja Yogis in France are going to be like lotuses, then will they are going to make the all place fragrant. I am sure of that. Very important because that’s the hell sometimes I feel. You all have double responsibility. Such a beautiful city, such a beautiful country. God has given you everything so beautiful. I don’t know how human beings are making a mess out of everything, like bacteria, they’ll spoil everything, it’s like fermented grape juice. What’s another question? You get lotuses…? Must try…Bring some lotuses from India, some seeds. It’s not difficult to grow…they can grow in very cold weather, from lake called Mansaroo at very high altitude where you get…and lotuses. It may grow. All right? So you have double responsibility.
[A yogi explaining to Shri Mataji about Sahaja Yoga programs in Santa Monica and Santa Cruz in America – transcript about this part has been ignored here, n.d.t.]

1:19:30:

Shri Mataji: How are you, Harry?
Harry: Very well, Mother
Shri Mataji: What did you do there?
Harry: Well we stayed … Warren and I was there for the last week, and we had a few programs. After Warren stayed at the hotel, same hotel that You were in, and then he came and he stayed at the Dr. Worlikar.
He stayed there for two days. And then we had two meetings there – one on a Thursday and one on Sunday.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Harry: And mainly Indians, the Indians came, all of them. And Warren made a tape for them.
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Harry: Warren, he made a tape for them. He described all about the chakras and how to raise the Kundalini, and the doctor wanted to know about the medical side of it. So he explained everything on the tape. And they have decided to have regular meetings on Thursdays at his home. Plus, the only two Americans interested were Michael – Michael and Roger.
Shri Mataji: And in Santa Cruz?
Harry: Yeah, well, in Santa Cruz the Indian man, Ravi. His American wife ….
Shri Mataji: Indian man?
Harry: Indian man, Ravi, and his wife was white. She was Danish. We had a meeting there on Thursday. But we tried to get a hall. But he couldn’t organize a hall. So and I phoned the old gentleman, the old gentleman who spoke with a hoarse voice and we could not get a … he said that before that to get a meeting in a savings place. But we tried there but we couldn’t get one. So the only place we had the meeting was at the Sikh’s place, Mr. Singh’s place. You know there was a Sikh gentleman ..
Shri Mataji: You are saying about what?
Harry: Santa Cruz
Shri Mataji: No, that Sikh doesn’t stay in Santa Cruz.
Harry: Yeah, but seeing that we couldn’t get the place in Santa Monica …
Shri Mataji: So you went to Santa Cruz.
Harry: Yes. No, we went to the Sikh’s place. He lived in …
Shri Mataji: Santa Monica, you’re telling.
Harry: Yeah. Well, we could not get the place in Santa Monica, so the Sikh said we could use his hotel and we had a meeting there and about ten other persons turned up and they were interested.
Shri Mataji: Out of ten, how many were Indians?
Harry: Well, at that meeting there were about two couples.
Shri Mataji: Indians?
Harry: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So the rest of them were six Americans only.
Harry: Yes.
Shri Mataji: How were they?
Harry: Well, they weren’t very good because they, they, You see they went to a lot of gurus.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Harry: There was one gentleman, the man who had the cirrhosis, he was very keen. And Michael and Roger.
Shri Mataji: I think there it will work out – Santa Monica. Other, because you had not place, nothing, all problems, you see?
Harry: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So Michael is going to work it out?
Harry: Well, Michael was, he said that he couldn’t get the place to stay, and he got very angry, and he said that it was Warren’s fault …
Shri Mataji: What?
Harry: … that he left Santa Cruz because he had problems with his Mom. He went there to stay.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Harry: He went to stay with his mother.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Harry: Michael, when he came back from Santa Cruz he went to stay with his mother.
Shri Mataji: Michael is the one who was with …
Harry: Yeah, the one who came to Santa Cruz, on his own and then drove with You to San Francisco.
Shri Mataji: Um.
Harry: Well, he returned and he stayed one night with his mother, and then his mother told him that he has to leave. So he could not get anywhere to stay. So he went to stay with another American, and the other American told him that he couldn’t stay there, too. So when I phoned him, he was very angry and he said it’s all Warren’s fault that, that he told You, so he’s going back to Santa Cruz. So he has gone back to Santa Cruz with his …
Shri Mataji: Such people, they have no money, they have this, they have …
It’s all right. So, Santa Monica, who’s going to do that?
Harry: Well, nobody at the moment, because on Thursday we had the meeting at the Indian’s place and he was not going to …
Shri Mataji: but what is happening to this, ah, she is going to stay in Santa Cruz?
Harry: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Do you see her?
Harry: Well, I haven’t heard from her, Mother, since she left with You.
Shri Mataji: So, Santa Cruz she might be having. Santa Cruz they are having.
So Santa Monica is finished like this?
Harry: Well, except the Indian man there with the white wife. He’ll probably start meetings, but he was saying he cannot allow Americans to go to his home. Because he wasn’t sure what sort of people they are and they might come to his house and, and, you know see things, and when he’s not there they can come and trouble his wife.
Shri Mataji: Bharkar.
Harry: Yeah, Bharkar. And then he says that for the Indians, the people that he knows, they can have regular meetings. But unless he knows the Americans, they can’t come to his home.
Shri Mataji: You see, all hippies. Horrible. And they go to the houses and they eat like gluttons and they take away things. It’s true what he says. Look at this Michael. Now, why should he blame anyone if there’s no room or something. I mean, Sahaja Yoga is not supposed to give you places.
What he said is true, also. So then why doesn’t he arrange, Bharkar, some general public place?
Harry: Yeah. He was talking about having a temple – the place where the Indians, you know, the Indians who are living there they have a meeting hall. So, Mr. Pradhan, Subhash Pradhan, he said that they will try to organize a meeting.
Shri Mataji: But then there will there, they won’t allow Americans to go there?
Harry: Yes, it’s a open hall. You see, it’s a temple in the main building where they have their meetings, and they have small rooms on the side. So they can hire the small rooms.
Shri Mataji: Then that’s all right.
In a meeting in Santa Cruz, there were four hundred and fifty hippies facing Me. And the Indians who were with Me got frightened. They’re very ego-oriented. And ultimately one of them hit Gregoire.
So either they are very over formal people, Americans are – they’ll wear their dark suits, hundreds of darks suits, you see, yards of them. Or they will be absolutely like this. Very dangerous. Very violent.
So he said he’d manage something, Bharkar?
Harry: Yes, but he said it depends upon the other Indians.
Shri Mataji: Uh?
Harry: It depends upon the other Indians. It all depends on Dr. Worlikar now.
Shri Mataji: Doctor?
Harry: Worlikar, the immunology man. It all depends on him.
Shri Mataji: So you write to Dr. Bharkar that Mother was asking about it, to take the help of Dr. Worlikar, because he works in Santa Monica.
And he has got the addresses, has he?
Harry: Yes. Well, I left the addresses before. I kept the addresses and I phoned to all the people.
Shri Mataji: But where are the addresses now?
Harry: Well, I have a photostat copy with me here in London and I left the original with Mr. Singh.
Shri Mataji: So write to Mr. Singh and to Mr. Worlikar, Dr. Worlikar, and to Bharkar. That they should try to arrange something. They can have program at Singh’s place. He won’t mind, it’s over there.
Harry: Yes.
