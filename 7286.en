Shri Mataji: So Don’t say that if we have to take out the paper plaster you have to take out... to take too this is nothing but conditioning not only victorian but this conditioning of ages. that’s only victorian that’s what? 100 years at the most..old conditioning there, all your forefathers they have left lots of things and all that kinds of problems you have developed because you came to this country, some of you lived in this country – all sorts of things.. and your hearts get broken very easily so I have to make a solid fiber glass heart
..Laughter,,,
... arrange it should be nicely skirted so there is no harm so that nobody gets hurt it’s all building up and what is the essence of it – that you should be able to enjoy – to be able to enjoy yourself, your own building, your own house, yourself, if you do not enjoy, what is the use of building your house, isn’t it? you can not enjoy your own house. I don’t know if it will be alright upstairs.
Shri Mataji: I am going away.. on the 20th I have to leave so may be next weekend we will never each other – this is the last weekend and I will be back in Australia
Yogi: Maureen is asking when will you go to France?
Shri Mataji: futuristic...Yogi: to arrange things before leaving...Shri Mataji: Is it that won’t be that much? I’ll be going in May. I think.. May. In May I’m going all Europe. America we should keep it in September? Not earlier - may be end of May. To be on the safe side – nobody wants you in august anywhere.
So May June July, may be September, October I should go to Wisden October we should keep
In May I should work in London I should say, by that time I am sure you... going to be important year 82 ... I have to see what the English sahaja yogis are going to do now. It is written down so that you will be chiselled out here so that you can go across everywhere to do sahaja yoga. That’s written by ... Blake – I am not saying that...is something that will go like that I think ah? you have to chop out you see and see just like we are tidying the whole house just in the same way comes from first floor to second – go on tidying up – and everywhere in the country you can go – talk about it, say things – you have to now start talking – the silence is not going to help you at all. Till little children grow up better they already have started talking – like Olympia will go out and say – pthhhetha. The way she was behaving coming to Me that day..Every time you said something she was like that (Mother is bending her head) happened the most similar last time..all the time: alsotatatatatat and then little this girl Aniki – I feel for her very much – she stood up there: somebody came and touched my feet, she said
: “she is not at all alright, not alright”.
Till they grow up, we have to prepare the ground for them and for everybody else. Basics are to be alright, that’s important otherwise you have to again open it and again correcting it so you get so fed up and if you have to read all the things you don’t like it isn’t it? So at least wherever you are you hold on to it like a peg being put there, don’t fall back If you fall back then again I find it difficult to raise you. Now most of you have gained a lot I must say from all over... Denis should have come today I wanted to see him the only person who is left out, Wendy might come on Tuesday she seems to be better....and another is David Backster. He could come and see me before I leave – it would be a good idea – another one who has turned out to be a medium. Journalists poor things they must be already mediums already. Yesterday they were telling about some journalist who went to Omeni – a lady and she completely embarrassed him, he said that why are you wearing such a dress? Or something to her... she was wearing a long cape so she said if you don’t like it I take it out. She took it out it was said so embarrassing – he ran away you are brahmachari... it was too much for her and I am told she went to Gaddaffi. Why? he was horrible...she went there and the photograph she was even afraid to take the photograph... she made lots of fun of him she must be herself a funny woman if you do all that.
So those who are coming to India – I don’t know how many are there going from London

Yogi: at the present we have not got anyone left
Shri Mataji: But Michael?
Yogi: I could not get through him on the phone to trace him, I will try again tonight
Shri Mataji: really? Why not I have given him the letter
Yogi: there is no telephone line. He does not have telephone
Shri Mataji: why not send him a telegram? Did you read the letter, the second one?
Yogi: he is very keen on going to India
Shri Mataji: you should say we have reserved the seat or something, alright? Ask Inesh to reserve a seat

Shri Mataji: better? So who else?
Shri Mataji: Please stop the...
Now I am going away who is going to cleanse? Now you have to cleanse yourself.. all of you
Look you see he is sitting here. Can you see better? He’s there
Now put your right hand towards that. Its fire isn’t it? Holiness of this fire he was the Mother of Brahma... and one of the greatest yogis you can think, he had to go with Rama for 14 years. 14 years he went to jungle with him because he was said to forest exile and there he had no wife, for 14 years he was without a wife. Rama had a wife he had no wife. The wife was left behind and one of the sisters of Ravana - Rakshasa- she came to entice him. He got so angry with her for that that he cut her nose... I think you are a very beautiful woman you’d better go and wash the feet of my wife. And so powerful he was, so powerful and he could never bear a single word said to Rama against Me...He was getting to big tempers for that. See how it is lit. He is happy now is burning

One of the things you can see how things can be sure that fire which is a purifying force it’s a purifier, purifies everything, if gold has something wrong it goes burning it anything that is wrong he burns it. In Sahaja yoga we use fire also. This is Lakshmana is the Sheesha. The story about him is like this: his daughter when he was with Vishnu Sheesha’s daughter was called as Sunucha and she was taken away by a Rakshasa called as Neguna (he was a son of Ravana) and he was very unhappy about it and this Neguna married this girl...funny situation, so Lakshamana wanted to get back his daughter to save her
