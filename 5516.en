Shri Guru Puja. Finchley ashram, London (UK), 21 July 1978.
PARTLY TRANSCRIBED

The worshipping of your Guru not of your Mother but of your Guru. The Guru establishes the Dharma, the sustenance in the disciple. He gives all clear cut ideas about what is the sustenance power for the disciple. He may preach for the whole world but for his disciples he gives very clear cut instructions. Most of the Gurus when they do it they actually chisel out every disciple.  First they weigh what is the urge of a disciple. How much a disciple really can receive and then they accept somebody as a disciple after verifying if the disciple is really capable of receiving even the instruction about dharma. But not in Sahaja Yoga because your Guru is a Mother so she initiates you without finding out what is your urge, what is your capability and what quality of a personality you have. It’s a very different style of guru that you have which looks after your body, looks after your mind and looks after your problems and then bestows upon you the blessing of kundalini awakening but normally the Gurus do not do the listening. They are only Gurus not Mothers. When you do the Guru Puja, what do you do to your Guru. You must understand that. That means you worship the principle of Guru in you by worshipping me. The principles within you which is to be awakened, which is to be blossomed by which you become the Gurus and the principle is that of Dharma so one has to know that when you are doing my puja I would like this time really to give you that blossoming within your being which makes you fragrant with Dharma. But as you have seen after realization you have to be very careful in the same way after becoming Guru it is even more necessary to be pure because as you know that in the West we have ego problem. The Westerners are ego oriented and this principle must be established. Guru means higher. Guru means the one who has more weight. Guru word is used even for magnetism which has more weight, gravity. Such a person has more gravity than others have. So he can teach others……..to be a higher person. When this awakens into you has to be sustained with complete observation within you that you do not succumb to the ……..of evil. Also you should not have irreligious behaviour nor you should have indecent behaviour neither you should be hot tempered nor should be servile but should be in the centre. You are the Guru. You are the higher personality than the rest of them. So you have to maintain a certain higher values of dignity of your own sustenance which has to be higher than those to whom you teach to become your disciple. If you are defective, it would be a very big loss for the sahaja yoga. Like you become the activated organs of the body. Supposing one cell dies, makes no difference to the body. Even many die, makes no difference. But if the organ fails in its functioning then all that depends on that organ fails completely. May be it may be finished. Now with ego, superego also becomes very active and many people feel that then how can we bear with load Oh Mother and the another receiving state starts. As soon as I say that there should be no ego expression, people do not like it and they want to escape it by saying “Oh we can’t do it. Its too much for us”. How can we come up to that point. This is a typical example of too much ego, superego. But it is not at all difficult. Its not at all difficult. First of all you must have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaja Yoga. I will definitely today awaken that in you. No doubt. I will. But keep it enlightened. By understanding that you are a Guru, you will understand your responsibility. We change our positions very easily in general life. If you are made a ……….you immediately assume as it is. In the same way when you are the Guru not by bestowing upon you any names or anything I call you a Guru, but because it has happened in you, in your nabhi chakra and in the void that you become the Guru. It’s a happening in your awareness that blossoms you into that position of a Guru. It is not artificial. It is no brain washing or anything it happens in you. But to retain it one has to. That the biggest thing on the ego is playing games. That is the biggest thing. Some people try to show that they are very innocent.  Some people try to show that they are very clever. Playing games is the worst thing of ego and that’s why you must know as a Guru, you are not to play games. You have to be absolutely straight forward, absolutely straight forward. Everyone can make you out what you are. As soon as you are a Guru, you have to be absolutely a transparent person. Face yourself. You make mistakes makes no difference at all, doesn’t make any difference at all if you make some mistakes. But do not pretend something which you are not.  Try to put up some sort of a face and all these things are not going to help. Sahaja yoga is a genuine thing, is a true thing and we have to be true. It doesn’t happen by just giving somebody a name now come along you become an initiator. It’s not that way. You have to raise the kundalini and give them realization and tell them that unless and until it is realized it won’t work. You could be better Gurus than me. I can assure you  for today. Firstly I am a Mother so the love principle is much more always it supersedes the Guru principle. You have to love others no doubt but in surrendering you can help me much more than I can help. For example, I will give you the example of Bala. He has a centre in Birmingham and he had some people and he came down to me yesterday I saw him. Of course he, he had lots of problems, tremendous problems on his kundalini but his surrendering capacity was so great that he just started sucking my vibrations just started flowing with it and it was only because he came through Bala.  Because Bala must have told him that the only way to do it is to surrender. And that has gone into his being so clearly that he has done it. He has been to all arguments everything and he has finished them off and when he came to me he just started getting everything into him and he was so much changed by the…..and he was amazed……saintliness coming out. I was amazed at it. But you yourself have to be very careful. You have to be loving no doubt. But loving doesn’t mean that you show fear about things and go out of the way to please people. No, it never means that. Neither it means shouting at people or getting angry with people but it never never means for a guru tatwa never means that you go on asking for ………Have a little indifference about it. If the disciple accepts, well and good but you are not going to throw……..for these animals to trample it so that dignity, the protocol of your own personality is maintained. That is very important because such people are extremely………and nobody will accept Guru who is like this. Try to show that you are afraid of them. If you are afraid how could you be the Guru or trying to show you are very innocent or very sweet overnight and looking after food this that. No.  They should look after you not that you should look after them. When you are the Guru, they have to look after you. Of course, you have to be kind  and you have to be nice to them as your Mother has been but you just don’t run after them. That will  reduce your quality as a Guru. Try in your own dignity and understanding. I know some of them which is……makes no difference. Somebody will laugh at him makes no difference.
