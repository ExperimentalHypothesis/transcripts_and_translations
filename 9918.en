Public Program Day 2

I bow all seekers ofthe spirit. The seeking ofthe spirit has been described by so many people from ancient times. It is nothing new that i'm taking that a human awareness speeches, a point where you start, see that there has to be something beyond on that time. Seeking start. And the person starts looking for something that will make that person the spirit, as all this would just have described. And dr baltar. There is no amount of talk is going to improve once because it is real it was sides with us in our heart now as it is you must have her many people talking about that you have to be spirit that you have to get your self realization you have to have self knowledge you have to know you but inside you were today what one has to do is to establish that at two lies to make it an experience off your old on this is a very big gift i think a very unique discovery that has come to us that we can actualize now we have to understand what sympathy that when this building manifest with us what should happen on the very gross level washing for speed it must be invigorated means you must get more energy in the body you must feel physical limit by going toe any processes or any motoring experience if health wise if you cannot then must build that stopped spinning because it is complete what you never get sick that is what spirit ? So first thing that should happen to you a style which will be an invigorating life a very dynamic the second thing that should happen is that from a very peaceful i didn't not like the ones who were devastated and in shock there is nothing you shall get in it's a kind of fear people have perhaps that if the troops they face the reality that comes. They have no basis for that. Might be one of the uses which makes him a person like trust about people talk. I think that the christ wass is in their pocket must know that first and foremost, a great place ofthe christ wants that he used a weapon off forgiveness. He was such a peaceful person on the grass also, that you say that. Forgive those who are doing this, father because they do not who ? What that offer personality. You can say he's, a special person. I'm not a person who gets agitated and hot tempered and start shouting the time today is extremely precarious, which we do not rely. For example, if you ask these people if christ comes and stands here american is there any way off recognized in christ ? They might become one super crucified christ because they did not record my sector. How are we getting a nice past is a very simple question which we never try toe cancer. There's. No way. Understand how we are going to mass ? Hey, simple question has no answer because you can. You cannot it's because we're awareness cannot make you honest. Like somebody told me that there's somebody who claims that his past, all right ? If you can walk on the water, then take that that's. One of the qualities. Now, whatever it is, the quality ofthe particular. And when it is to be seeing that every event has a particular quality, which is being already described in the ancient books, you should not accept anybody possesses. This is the problem because that we get ourselves some sort of mental conception living. Our forefathers completed. Their forefathers ultimately find started. So one has to know that when you, at least when you say that you believe in christ, how you recognise christ, is there. Any moment is that it is shown a weapon that will tell you that that means you should become a spirit. You have, you feed the food, you have a new awareness of vibrant uranus. The trip dimension within you rises into that, by which, when you ask, he's described vibrations, vengeance. You know, this is christ. If he's a fake person, you might get blisters, you might get terrible feet from sectionals. But if it is, christ, get tremendous, please. This is the sign how to make out whether he's christ, that's, why, he said that you would be calling me christ christ. I won't recognize that's it. You live with an idea with mental projection on, then you can all world. Possibilities. Chances. Off your asses, you must keep yourself open like a scientist. Us, keep yourself off your mind should be open. You should not close down by any dogma or any time off such theory that makes you completely excluded from the rest ofthe thing, or which makes you non reflect, which makes you a person who cannot reflect, get out anymore about such a personality developed, which is going to be very, very dangerous for you. So the personality should be over. Should be receptive, understand ? Now, as i told you yesterday back it is a spontaneous happening is still happening off the living process with it is nothing to do with art. Of course the churches were established. They tried to be good to people in the sense they told them that to be in the balance keep the balance another but it went too far with certain things like baptism. I think that where they everybody started putting their hands on top ofthe anyone i said that your past best not proper means it is toback tyson is not the authority that you can get from any schools colleges but you have to get it from if you are realized so then you can pacify everybody cannot baptize everybody even i don't think price disciple baptized in they did not. It is later on. I don't know how it brought into the organization that you could ask somebody to go and baptize will you make us here ? Said that the police cost me on my head like right ? Actually, that person was to baptize has to be realized. So because he's a means everything of the colony and breaking up this area over to the subtle that better not be yet in all humbleness, if you meet each one must understand that that is not your choice say, for example, i do not know anything about the machine. Oh, i started like what we have. But same thing happens with people who do not have that do god's work, start doing guards, for they turned everyone into difficulties, and ultimately they're neutralized. It is high time for all of them to see that what they have to do, all these institutions, is no rather month, nothing like that. But what you have to do is to transform people through there through there, really back, please. This is what people have realized that there's something wrong somewhere that we are not connected where it happened the first thing that happens to you that become collectively conscious as what it has to this collectively consciousness is not paper that your attention itself your attention which is felt on the central services toe get light in the sense that has like peter when you touch peter you can communicate anything from here everything in the saving you that all pervading father you can communicate that father in there sitting down it is collectively conscious moreover collectively conscious lease that you can feel a person whether it is the person he is all right he has a problem with these melanie is in this part of the body or if he has got some disease you can feel also about yours that's the sign of that you are tonight ability how the person is you may not have cereal leaving say to be or may not try to inform the person that ever came to me and she wass she was having cancer i do i tried a night and she's still so you don't have to tell you because you don't have to achieve anything by telling you what you have to do is to achieve if she can be all right if you can but your attitude is not cure me that's thirty two off the river because it has got common sense if you know that a certain car is going to be a giant forever. It is off values. You don't repair such so, despite the affection and compassion have for everyone. You want to see that by giving realization to this man who is absolutely people for nothing. You know that you are just toe voice before, so you don't even wantto talk to such a man about or leave alone, which is such a good thing, too, he realization to a man who is absolutely against, like hitler, for example, if he says that you really like what ? It is just like so you have to have basically see if you are seeing them. Then you get your realization. You become collectively bunches. We're going to consciousness. You can also raise the possibility off. You can show you can mentally improved, you can settle them with peace, then sitting down here, you can tell about everyone what's, wrong with that person and sitting down here, you can try her. It is not in difficulty at all because you become them like we have seen a television. If it puts to the men means it starts acting in such a fantastic man that nobody can believe that this little box can behave like this in the same way this little box started behaving in that destiny. This should happen to you. Otherwise, you should not believe that you have. It is not a make believe. It is not just a mental understanding that you are twice for it is none of it is something that has sprouted within you, which has two. If you are lovers on, if you really respect yourself as people seeking the total, nothing else, it happens to you and grow completely in. Secondly, what happens to you is that you start understanding that it is. Because supposing there were, as i told you, that there was a gentleman who's, one of the six on. We did not know about it. You wanted to know what his father so i said, all right, put your hands and how's your foot. He just asked his father any water burning sensation. This thing got here. So he asked me why i recorded it. I said this finger relates to this portion and these are the center's off your father. If it is so, then you better ask your father. But i'm sure he must be down with very bad bronchitis. He telephoned his mother in scotland because she came on the phone and she said, your father is down with very bad sitting down there. I told him how you can. Surely after that four, five hours was out it can you have that test ? You are that it's. So your rotation becomes life. There is no question off you trying to put some spirits into things. And we've always useless things only thing what you have to do is to awaken the spirits in that person who say on the spirit takes over. Because it becomes also, you'll start understanding that this system because you really fight every moment, you vilify, frustrating it's a food. Sometimes you think by chance you take, or maybe so, like later on, we'll start seeing that it is true. It is so you put down sugar, if they realize source, and there are many these days, even in your country, we have seen lots of children who are born. You should die up there eyes and put one person, and you asked him what's the matter with this mind, tell us, was it they raise one for this couples, you asking you, do you have a heart attack ? This shows the yes, i hear. How do i said all of the mushroom ? One picture is that. On then you start understanding that this is there is no argument. There is no other opinion about only one opinion, because truth is absolute. Somebody says, this is prized. Somebody says that describe somebody, says, this is bama. It is never liked. It is one that fruit is one you cannot have told me is absolutely. Your subject becomes enlightened, you can save. So the second thing that happens to you, that you start moving the fruit, which is absolute. What put your hands like this. Now, as you have become an a computer, you are a computer, which has started even though all these instruments that are battling over evolution, whatever is between us, as but if you see it. It tested tape but without thinking i mean i look at you i know you are there i don't have to take it this kind of computer human beings take thousands of years to make that just thinks and spontaneously knows we are already such a big computer but we have even become absolute computers when we start asking questions is there a god now those were it east they ask a question they start getting recently you ask any absolute question wass christ the son of god why should people except bob why should they accept anything except this because if you ask you get the preschool reason as an us then you know it as it but people should know that how it is accident i'll tell you an example like us we have some politics here in india we also have lots of fun when i had my program in a hole where it was belonging to parents on another type of twice for no instead of testifying so they learned that i'm brandon so they were very angry at this if we can't have her program on these organizes did not tell me that they don't want to have your program because you are not nothing but they went and told that all right i don't want to have to publish it in the newspaper because that is not a family so they don't want to have her program there this was too much for them to take up upon themselves so they said no, no, no, no. If you have published in the newspaper so i said i started speaking i just spontaneously i said, please come forward those who are putting their real parents four, five, of course i mean in india you don't find people of this time. Normally they don't challenge a seat normally. So they came for i sat down on their hands. Will she like this ? So i said now if you're really glamorous way you she should not shake before said mother, were shaky because your ship you're the bomb that's, maybe a she is it normal body shaking here ? So i said no, but beastie for shipping going ask them what ? So they went and asked one. They said, we are certified genetics coming from lunatic asylum. Our doctor has brought us that because one of us was cured by matter you sylvia. Yes, it's. The sort of people do that thing. You're shaking the same way and they're also she this fanaticism is making you shit. And this is. The main point is that when you become the truth, you start understanding absolute nature. There is no. If this is so, this is it. This is so this is you cannot compromise. You gonna make it a little different ? You cannot synthesize you cannot analyze day saw so it is. And you get confirmed about when going your way. You start finding that system. So you i understand your mental activity. First your rationality goes, they're legit. And then you start accepting. But i'm talking that happens is the best for issa turning that you see the whole world as fun. You see, the whole world has a big job. You see the whole world as a witness. Like that part rises within us. And also another thing that rises and falls when we are on the waves of the thought. You have frightened we have here. We have bodies, we have jealousies and almost but supposing you were into the boat, then you start watching. That means in the same way you, john such an awareness where you start, what the whole thing as a chip as a front as a play on the whole thing becomes a plate to your mind. Starts i've been the joy stark sporting like you all say that bull alisa parenti is why should i ? She is not one of these modern. We've been. She is a very old fashioned woman, quite a plum. I didn't say that. What boat ? If you have realized so, you can see the vibration, it sort of just that's what it is if you go to the sistine chapel off the critical what michael engine heston is nothing but here speeding violations too many and you see christ help for christ a job, a stall fellow standing there for people here in this is what is that today ? This is the time of judgement, and the whole thing is nothing but the talented also, and i don't get priced to sell their train. People decide that this is what it is he's depicted here, his old understanding because you realized, shows it ready, but then on the altar to find a blanket banking crisis to see absolutely like a patient about die, only the bones to seek cover with the would you call escape ? How can a christ like cities relax, let these people try once, carried the cross, and they know that she would not be like that he could not. Such electric is a person of joy, health, happiness and a human's. How can be anyone who is a man ofthe court ? Six. Agitated, hot temper. And he has to have that city. He has to have that beautiful, soothing. Impression on others. How can that person who is such a great incarnation came on this earth to be a bony structure like that ? This is what we teach. We have such misconceptions about all of them, such misconceptions, and we want to put all this conception on god. But you cannot conceptualize the team that stands between you and yourself. Is your equal on your conscience worked in stan. They're like balance when this you see here, it's, not here, when she realizes process over the center. Then what happens ? Your ego and super ego it's represents your conditioning when we dissected that is the that is the center of fast. When he's awakened you, he sucks that's, the place where he's at the cross. Tomorrow. I think they'll bring the chart and i'll be able to explain to him more duties. And that is the time when you are that you got a lot of people and you become yourself. Joyce tastic hole is the joy starts. All other pursuits are joyce, that is no join on jive isn't reality like happiness. Happiness comes to you. Value spam on happy ness comes to you when you're conditioning troubles. But joy has no reality is just a feeling off complete, alleviated soul you feel completely elevated about else enjoy the bliss. Actually, if you see, i mean one of us has painting, even with joy is pouring just like during shell a person will do must be the one who has felt that joy has, but instead it's a person who is always thinking and try to think it out. What should be done there ? He doesn't get the joy, a tall you get detained and there is a tart in between. It kissed. Supposing i am here on isis, something beautiful here, and i started thinking about then i start thinking how much it must have cost, how unsure what to do with it, but there is no complete creation of that beauty flows inside, just like joy, and this is what has to happen to you if you become, if it does not happen to you don't believe in anyone. Also, you should not into anything unless in nt yu get yur spirit, which manifest all list. It has nothing to do with your intellectualizing your your analysts, or it is something that you have with the years which you're old. It is, but then you have to get them yourself by your achievements. In a sense, you're all good. Elena rises, touches here on purpose. Now, as i told you, what i do is a simple thing. That i enlighten a light which is ready, which is which is, again, in turn, becomes a lighter. I can enlighten you, his doctor, why he was here. He came to me with this friend. I just telephoned. We had nothing, just a telephone number, and many reforms to get to me. What is the elevation ? And we must have given realization, wass in the same way you can also give realization that's how we can split the knowledge that knowledge off guard ofthe divine. Mechanised. How it is not. But everyone can i must say that i do not say that all of you really, but should get that's fine is if you get it, you're very fortunate, you have fun, what you have to find it, and if you don't get it, i would say that i tried it has to happen to you and that it should happen in a way that it becomes part and parcel off your central nervous system that hasn't management, so i have to tell you one thing, the one who has treated us is anxious that enter into this kingdom police officer, may god bless you i would like to ask me questions, but not like the baby a steady happened. People say that mother known pastor to ask questions because as soon as they asked him to ask questions, they start behaving like devin's. There is no need to be aggressive with me. What does that mean ? I have come here to give what is your own ? Why should be ? I just don't understand, say, college, i'm not going to take away anything. Then what ? What ? Ask your questions. Stop! See, he said, just just a moment, he said that, as you have said, truth is universal, that it is reality. But everybody's concept of reality may be different. I know it is to that with one ship has. Has to be different because everybody has their own way, understand, great, but wait, then there is no more perceptive reality. Son, you can start your consciousness to your central analyst. It is no more concept becomes the reality itself, the school that it has to be. Actually, i understand i don't mind having them different concepts, but i don't believe in your concept because it has given notice potential. Nor is it it's over that's fun. The concept's dissolved. What ? For example, suppose i'm not seeing this judge. And some people say yes in a church. I may have some money. All right, when i come and i see it for myself, and i know this is a joke, i have no concept of what it's like. Simple, but it is common sense. I think it is really common sense, actually really shocked how people live in concert. Sometimes i'm really surprised how they're based upon their lives after lives on false, a severely surprising, but they live because you see ego likes me. It wants to live with me, like sickly, believing that they are superior race. Imagine, get millions and millions of people with that for me, like coming, thinks he's, the greatest religious man in that bar, is going to put him in his room. It's! True, you think you see the effects of this concept everywhere. The problem is a concept it takes to make a problem. Why we're fighting ? No, that one right now, i'll decide. He's asked you to speak about the love and compassion of the divine mother on her qualities. This is it. Mother medicine. She has a capacity for us. She is. Must have fallen all sixes. Then we extract. Or stupid, i guess off all kinds of extracting. She don't. Well, but sometimes fun. Then she doesn't much like you have earthquakes, many things, but she has a special james has. Made by seasons. Creation of seasons. See the flowers. You see everything, how she makes a life. So you want us so joy. That means knowledge is like when you get that it's. There you are, maze, how i didn't and how she sings. I want to. Oh! When monday. What ? Please, i get it. I see my son. This is that one, this is yes, see ? No. I can't. So that was it. Actually, space completely clenching my mother. I can't even control this thing. I've been a city on a little store. Just so i just kind of went inside. No. Yeah. Yes, what ? What temperament ? No, what ? So, dominic what ? Please enjoy. So what ? And that is how. Mother says that she so it's you. She knows your problems, she said. Please, i tell you about mr. Still many stories, they can tell you, but one day. So i said, somebody must have another lady with evil very much more so. Must, yeah, they just have. So they say two. Place organized. Now. When i saw that with my, they're just that's it. What combination to the safe ? When i get back, he said, no one tio from that place. So we thought we'd better ride side, step into the money. Then start. And all of you have a very bad back. And right after that, i said, it's your life. I never said that she had speak so. Mother teaches you all right. But it is never a big punishment. So it is love. Which plans should your father should be in college ? But if you're able to expand and o r so there are many, and then they have to it's that that's. What gradually and people come to understand. Do haze, which hold on. We should try to do something that that's it is. It gots out in such a manner that you don't have to shout or holding. But the lessons are so. He says. So yeah. T. Time. And she wrote a letter. It is. He has food. So she she took a trip from house just to soothe it's. Going to be a mother to say street, get four houses. So they're meant to be. What is it ? Yes. School on the value of rice, which you wanted to buy a sound the same as they have. So it is in such a sweet man. See, you must know a loving mother she's. Exactly, william. But she doesn't show that our sufferings more than others. Better, that she doesn't like you, but she wants to share. That's. The greatest joy. Inside. But they will. How they only challenge themselves in such. It's the greatest thing. I have you on such a nice question. But i feel because it is really lovely in time. Yeah, yes. Champ. Wait. Have i answered your questions here ? They say. What ? What ? Now. Please clearing.
