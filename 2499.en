[English translation from Hindi]

Today is the birthday of Adi Guru Nanaka, and it is being celebrated through-out the world surprisingly with a zeal that I have not seen before in India.

First time, it was announced in many newspapers and a lot was done. Guru Nanaka only spoke about Sahaja Yoga, and said that everything else is just a superficial display. About religion He said that observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, going here and there, all are meant just to show off. Now you need to find the (Spirit/the power) within you and establish it inside yourself. Again and again he kept saying this. He did not say any other thing, even to the extent that He did not talk of any rituals. But when after Him, Guru Teg Bahadur became the guru - I think today is His martyr's day? SY: Tomorrow. SM: Tomorrow, tomorrow is his martyr's day. He was also of the same opinion, but the person who was the last guru, because war was being fought, he created rituals.

So he prescribed Kada (iron bangle) to be worn, not to cut their hair. All these were prescribed by him. All these were imposed by him. But Guru Nanaka only talked about the Spirit. Everything else is of no value, He explained it very clearly. But no one reads what He wrote, what to do? They will just put a finger on the verset in the book, move it along the line, recite it and then go to the next verset. Can anyone understand it in this way? If we go through His writings properly and absorb them, then the whole confusion from Shabad-Jala (web of words) will end. But most people are still caught in that.

And in that confusion see the condition of Sikhs! They have no desire to look inside, which they should have. If there is no inner search, how could one follow Sikh dharma? This is His actual teaching. His teachings are called "sikhi" (path of learning), meaning "I have written this for you to read and learn". And all the big saints who came at that time, and afterwards as well said the same thing. Big saints were born and He knew who was a saint and who was not. He included all their poems and experiences in His book. That is why the Granth Sahib is worthy of worship, because such people who were recognized and followed as great gurus at that time who had done great work and were spiritual, all their work was consolidated and put into Guru Granth Sahib. That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga as well.

We do not follow any particular saint; we respect them and merge their teachings. This is what He did at that time. But whatever He said and wrote, was lost in words, beacause people did not go beyond the words. That is why Kabira wrote: "By reading too much, the pandits became foolish". It is that only. They have become fools. Now there is no fight or anything else so what is the need to wear a turban? Or what is the need to be conditioned to have "Kachhehra" (underware) or to carry a comb all the time? They do all these things as told but they drink alcohol. They have no problem in drinking, though their guru forbade alcohol.

One who talks of self-consciousness could never support alcohol. They drink alcohol but are very particular about these other things, like wear a turban or doing one thing or another. They want to create a clan and live in that clan. And by doing all these outward things, they pay less attention to the inner ones which were preached. Like that they have continued - I don't know how, they have taken to this kind of ritualism and became completely outside oriented people. Their attention is outside so they perceive only the outside view. Now to turn these people towards Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult as we are already doing all the things mentioned by Him. They have not done these things and we are doing them - it is the only difference. They talked of achieving “Sahaja Samadhi”, but how? He has also said that it will be done by the Kundalini.

But who would raise the Kundalini? Guru Nanak did not give Realization to anybody, as far as I know. He had only two disciples. He gave Realization only to these two disciples. If one person gives realization to only two of his disciples, what effect will that have? But people took only His outside things and went on. They built big, big things, you can see all over so many temples and so on. What is the benefit in that? But they built few evolved people only and the remaining is just a race of Sikhs. How to explain this to them?

But now I have seen that they have started coming to Sahaja Yoga. At least 8-10 Sikh people have come to Sahaja Yoga. I recognize them as they wear turbans, but maybe some are without. One branch of Sikhs are the Namdhari. They believe in Me. Many of them are in Bangkok. Maybe fifty or sixty came to the programme, wearing white turbans. So I do not know what is their speciality, but they follow what Guru Nanak had said. Like that diversions keep on coming in religion but what have they achieved like this? They are fighting with each other.

What is the use? While Guru Nanak said that He is a "pir" (saint) for the Muslims and a guru for the hindus, and their "pir" (saint)... None will understand this unless they are realized. But this was necessary to happen to prepare us. All of the gurus have helped in preparing you. In the end our duty is to follow what they have said. But the condition of all the gurus' teachings became the same and many seekers were lost, no one knows where! I was talking about Gyan Deva (Gyaneshwara), how great He became. He belonged to the Nath-Panth order and He wrote about Kundalini. But His disciples used to call themselves "varkaris" (pilgrims). Nowadays they make a show out of it, carrying heavy bronze cymbals, weighing 1kg total, beating them all the way to the temple Pandhari Nath in Pandharpur.

And the clothes they wear are called "lattar", made up of jute and all torn. They consider it a big sacrifice, beating the cymbals during their month long pilgrimage. And they keep on chewing tobacco all the way. Such are the "varkaris". And then they created their own religious sect. What is the speciality of this sect? They take out a procession with a palanquin for Gyan Deva, who did not even have shoes to wear, but they carry His padukas from village to village in the palanquin. They take the palanquin through 25 villages and demand food there. They go from village to village and eat food everywhere. This is a new method of begging, these type of things are just another way of begging.

Thirdly, He was born in Alandi, near Pune. Later he went to Niwase, but He was born here. Women there take earthen flower pots with tulsi growing in it, completely filled with soil weighing at least 3-4 kg, and carry them on their heads all the way to Alandi. I have seen it with My own eyes. I do not understand why they do it. And so many people have earned so much money using His name. How do people believe in someone taking a guru's name to make money? And because of this all His work got finished. Not only that, one fellow gives big lectures on Gyan Deva and earns a lot of money just by giving lectures, but he speaks whatever he feels like and people keep on listening to him. People are filled with this type of blind faith.

The same thing happened to Shri Guru Nanak. I notice that no one actually knows what He said and did not say. To this extent that they made a city called Chandigarh, while He was referring about My coming as Chandi (Devi). He has described everything - nobody even sees that. The same way all gurus end up. But now, to those who are realised it will not happen, because now that you have got the truth you cannot accept falsehood. And anything false emerges then it will be finished. So many people have got Realization around the world that now no one can spread a lie. Everything that I have said is taped and recorded so nobody can alter that. That is why I did not write a book, because you have to listen to the tapes, but a book you can keep on reading but without understanding it.

Just staring in the books...that is why I thought its better I write less. The more you listen to the tapes the better it will register in your brain. Otherwise just by reading you get only entertainment. What is the use? Let's see what becomes of Sahaja Yoga in the future. I don't know but things can go wrong. But as Sahaja Yogis have reached a level, I believe they cannot go astray. You should not do wrong things. This is one thing you have to learn from His life, from what Guru Nanak said, He wrote book after book. If you read the Guru Vani (words of the Guru), it says only that: "Know thy Self, recognize your Self".

But what are the people doing? But this will not happen in Sahaja Yoga. Now I have established everybody so they cannot change back now. Even if they want, it cannot happen now. Whatever had to happen has happened. Despite all the disrespect, all the troubles and adversities Guru Nanak faced, He did so much. But He did not give Realization as I was telling you earlier. He did not give Realization, so people did not experience it. Now you can say what you want, say what you may, by taking anyone's name from the scripture you will not change. It will happen only though Realization.

This is one lesson we should take from Him that we should not go on the wrong path or hold other beliefs. This is very important. We are Sahaja Yogis, we understand Sahaja Yoga so proficiently and deeply, so there is no need to come up with something new from it. Even now there are one or two people who say: "Do this, do that". This is all useless talk. How should I say this? In a way... ...their behaviour is completely false. There is no truth in it. Like: "Keep the water this side. Keep something else there".

I have never said anything like this. Those things I have never said, they are doing. But now if they hear My speeches with their ears they will understand as from the ears it will go in their brain. They will not learn the true meaning by reading, but by listening. Why do you do things I have not said? It is because of old conditionings. It happens because of that also. You move ahead with old conditionings developed since your birth. Until these conditionings are dropped, the true form of Sahaja Yoga cannot manifest. And I have made you special.

You are special people; special because you know dharma, you know everything. you know about yourself, you know about others, you can give Realization, you understand everything, so you are fully accomplished (sampoorna). So after this why should you go astray? There is no reason for it. We should also reflect to how hard Guru Nanak worked and how much He had to endure. His wife was also not good and gave Him lot of trouble. And what is the state today of what He created from His hard work? Same about Jesus Christ, about Mohamed Sahib and all the others. Guru Nanak's work was distorted the most even though He was one of the last Gurus who came. He explained a lot, did everything.

After Him, Shri Sainath came who said there is no need to follow rituals, they are all useless. He said clearly that if one starts anything, people will spoil it, because they are not awakened. It's different after Realization - all become one, all become wise. Without Realization it's a very difficult task. So He did not do any of that, He did not organize people or anything else, He had His disciples and that's it. And even I have not organized anything. Even though we don't have an organization, after Realization people become organized on their own. Like in the human body all the organs get organized automatically. Just like that - there is no separate organization or anything else. Everything works on its own.

My eternal blessings to you all. And you need to take care that what you have received you should not distort. There can be no bigger sin than that. And we should not distort it for any reason. We should not allow distortion to come. Eternal blessings to you all.
