Public Program. Kongresshaus, Vienna (Austria), 9 June 1988.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

Yesterday I was happy that so many of you have felt the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost. This is the All pervading power of God's Love about which all the scriptures have written. But in modern times because we never felt this Breeze we have even denied the existence of God. But once you get connected to this Divine force, then it starts working through you in such a wonderful way, that you are amazed.

As you see this instrument (ed: microphone) that I have here has to by connected to the mains. In the same way every human-being is to be connected to the mains, and that is this power which I am talking about. This is what Christ has said that, "You have to be born again." Now in India we call a person who is a Brahmin, the one who has known this Brahma, the All pervading power as dwijaha - meaning twiceborn. And even a bird is called as dwijaha in Sanskrit language meaning twice-born, it is an egg-first and then it becomes the bird. But we have many people in India, just brand themselves as Brahmins, though they are not twice-born. In the same way you find it everywhere that they just take a pride, "I am this, I am that," but they are not. If you are a twice-born person, then you have to feel this All pervading power. You have to feel the centers, your own centers on your fingertips - one, two, three, four, five, six and seven. Precisely - there's no doubt when you feel them, you know what's wrong with you or wrong with others.

Now supposing you are feeling the pain here. Now, these are the centers of your father. And this is the finger that shows Vishuddhi chakra here. If you then telephone to your father and ask him how is he, will tell you that he is down with very bad bronchitis.

This is the science of the roots. As I told you that we have the science of the tree, but not the science of the roots. This science does not change, it's absolutely precise. And is so effective and efficient, that it works faster than even lights. Because the whole cosmos is connected. Is all being vibrated with this power. You see this power as small comas after Realization in the sky. You see various things after Realization. And you have to know what those things are.
My work is only to decode it. And then you have to verify that what I have decoded is there or not.

Anybody can get this knowledge. It has no limitation of any cast, creed, or race, religion or nation. Everyone has this residual power of Kundalini in themselves. And you can see in some people this Kundalini pulsating like a heart in the triangular bone. And this triangular bone is called as Sacrum, meaning sacred. That means the Greek have given this name to this bone knowing that it contains the Kundalini.

Even the word Athena - Atha in Sanskrit means primordial. So that's the Primordial Mother is Athena. I can give you thousands and thousands of examples of quotations. But best thing is to face the truth yourself, and see with yourself. People are advertising, saying there is a New Age that has come. The people of New Age are just the same like all of us. What is so special about them? If you have to go to their programs you have to pay. And they say, "We can clear your chakras." But how can you clear the chakras unless and until the Kundalini is awakened?

When I went to America they said I must make copyright of all My lectures. Because I have to use My knowledge and make some organizations. I said, "Let them do it, very good." Also if they can rise the Kundalini, nothing like. But they cannot, they cannot. Unless and until you became realized souls and know all about Kundalini you cannot raise the Kundalini. All those people, who are singing so joyfully here can do it. All those, who will get Realization among you also can do it.

William Blake, who was a great poet from England, has said that God - God's men, Men of God will get their Realization, and they'll make others realized. This He said 100 years back. Now we have to see one thing, that those who say, "We are this and we are that," what is the speciality? Supposing you are a Jew, you are a Christian, you are a Hindu, you're all just the same. What is the speciality? Somebody says, "I go to this guru, that guru, this one." But what is the speciality? They are all suffering, they're all having diseases. They don't know anything about their inner being.

So a person who is a twice-born has to be something very different. As I told you yesterday, I'll tell you today about what happens when the chakras get enlightened. The first chakra is the chakra of purity, of holiness, of auspiciousness. We are born with auspiciousness, we are holy. There is no original sin which is attached to us. The original sin was done be Adam and Eve that they disobeyed God Almighty. If they had not disobeyed, we would have only shortened this event of New Age. There would have been no necessity to have all this evolutionary process to take this long route to come to the point.

So we come to conclusion in this manner that if the prophets and incarnations have proclaimed that there is an All pervading power of Divine Love, let us find it out first of all. It is very unscientific to deny something without finding it out. And it's very dishonest. Unless and until you have finally found it out how can you say that it does not exist? But atheists are all right. Because they have not found anything, so they are saying, "We don't believe in it." It's that, all right. So whether you believe in it or not makes no difference. Blind faith is not [in it ?]. You have to get it yourself. It's clearly said by all the saints. I mean the real saints. Like Guru Nanaka has said that, "Unless and until you find it within yourself it's a all confusion." Kabira has talked about Kundalini, about Sahaj Samadhi, he has talked all about Sahaja Yoga. Gyaneshwara in India has written a complete chapter on it. Even in Koran there is such a lot about the resurrection - the Kiyama.

But like politics, religion also has become a theory. And Adi Shankaracharya calls it Shabdajalam, meaning the 'net of words'. So he said, "Mother, take me out of this net of words."

Now let us see the principal of politics also - very interesting to see. Now in politics we believe in the democratic countries that we all must have individual freedom. They think that individual freedom is above everything else. But what about the collective freedom? If you go to America you can't wear any ornaments, you can't take your purse in your hand. Everybody is standing with a gun around the corner. All kinds of funny women are at the corners, you can find it even here. Very aggressive sight, I tell you, horrible - you feel like vomiting. But they have individual freedom (Laughter) to do it as freely as they want. To kill as many as they like. So this is all self indulgence. Accumulating money as much as you like, if the rest starts dying, doesn't matter.

So democracy goes hand in hand - or capitalism goes hand in hand with money. Also corruption follows. It has to be corrupt, you can't help it. As long as you are not caught in the law you are all right.

Now take the communism - because I have been to all communist countries also. There the collective freedom is more important then the individual. Now the individual becomes weak. When those people come to free countries, they'll drink like fishes. (Laughter) In Arab countries they are not supposed to touch drinks. Even Sikhs - that was the highest, because Nanaka was the last - they said that, "No drinking, no smoking." But if you see in England, they drink much more then Scottish men. (Laughter) Same in India, see, they say that God resides in everyone in Hindu philosophy and they have such horrid cast system.

So the collective cannot be strong unless and until the individual becomes strong. But when you want to make the individual strong, they go astray, they go mad. In America you feel that every third person is off his head. (Laughter) Then - you know - their eyes are twitching, the noses are twitching, the whole body goes (Laughter) - so nervous. If they have individual freedom, why should be that nervous? Now in this individual freedom they have created AIDS, drugs, every sort of nonsense. So they realize some times, of course, that, "We should come to the center." But still they miss the point.

We can say, this is the right side movement, which is disciplining and collective and the left side movement is individual. So I met a very important politician in London, she said that, "Now we are fed up of left and right, we have to be in the center." But I said, "You are static in the center." But she said, "What shall we do?" I said, "You should ascend," that's what it is.

They all these theories are now standing before us. You see the fundamentalists, you see all these religions, we see all this hypocrits, and on the other side you see the politics. All in a confusion for any sensible man. We have created science, all right, science, science, science - so what? There's an atombomb like a devil sitting there. What is the epitome of science, all kinds of destructive weapons. So what has happened is that when you put your mental projection it just moves linear, and attacks you back. So the human awareness has to take a new dimension, the dimension of spiritual awareness. This is the breakthrough, which has to take place when we have to become the Spirit. We have to become the Spirit and when we become the Spirit, then what do we see, that we are absolutely integrated.

I would say, that I am a capitalist or I am a democrat, I am - because I have powers. But I am a real communist, because I can't enjoy My powers unless and until I give it to you. I have to share with you. Otherwise I am not happy with Myself. So these both things meet when you become the Spirit. You do not move in a linear way, but you are like rays going from the sun from all sides. No more you take, you just give. And enjoy your generosity, enjoy all the righteousness, enjoy the bliss and the peace within you.

Now the diseases fall onto us is this way that we have within us centers which are made like this (ed: Shri Mataji puts both hands together) This is the left side and this is the right side. The left side is the one that looks after the emotional side, the desire side. And the right side looks after your physical side and your mental side. When you go to the left or to the right too much then you break the relations with the whole or you get constricted. Your power gets less, because all the power is flown out. So imbalance is built in us as problems on our chakras. And that's how we suffer.

Now the Dharma - all the religion that is established by great prophets - starting right from Socrates, [Sai Natha ?] up to Guru Nanaka - you can say that that all is just to establish a balance within us. Moses, Abraham, all of them did that. They all tried to give us the idea of balancing, of temperance ??? within us. For our ultimate purification.

Now, all this balance we have lost. On the physical level, on mental level, emotional level and also spiritual level. Going to fake gurus, having false ideas. We have lost in those wildernesses. Now, the only thing we have to do is to raise your Kundalini. When the Kundalini rises, it passes through these centers and puts them right, energizes them, gives them energy and pierces through the fontanel bone, so that She gives you the connection with the All pervading Power.

So most of the diseases get cured in no time, and all the habits drop out. You are not slave of any temptations, and an innate morality is born within you. When they don't have to say, "Don't," they just don't do it. So this is just at your doorsteps. But there is one small thing, that in Sahaja Yoga you cannot pay, you cannot - you don't have to put in any effort, but there is one thing - that you have to become. You have to have your vibrations pure - [high ??] as they call it - pure. And you have to know all about Kundalini and vibrations. And that is how you are called a Sahaja Yogi. It is a state, state of personality, which is collectively conscious. The consciousness is on your fingertips. So that you can feel everybody's chakras. And a tremendous compassion and concern starts flowing outward and inside. But this compassion acts. You don't have adulterous eyes any more. And you get pure eyes, light in your eyes. Such a person even with a glance can do miracles. But such a person is very humble, [honestly made ?], and loving. It's such a joy to give Realizations to others. Now when you get Realization, you can give to others. Happiness and unhappiness are two faces of one coin, but joy is absolute. So you fall into the ocean of joy. And then you become the witness of the whole drama. Your attention becomes active. You pay attention to something and that works, that acts. Above all you know the absolute truth. No relative understanding. You lead a very healthy life.

Somebody asked Me today, "Mother, how can it be so easy?" It is easy, because it's so vital. Like breathing is so vital. You don't have to go to your guru to ask how to breath otherwise we will all die. In the same way today it is so vital, so important to get Realization.

Now, forget about the past. Forget about your past lives, this Karma Yoga, this yoga, that yoga. Forget it. When the Kundalini rises and passes through the Agnya-Chakra then your all your problems are sucked by Christ. And you don't have to suffer at all. All your sufferings are over.

There's a question about how the saints have suffered? Most of the saints have been certified people. Like a temple can certify somebody as saint or some organization can call it a saint or something like that. They are not real saints. Real saints are the ones which are sent by God and certified by God. They don't suffer. They don't have to suffer. And you won't have to suffer any more.

The world has to be saved. It's a big responsibility. Your children are to be saved. And we have to make a new generation of a new race.

Thank you very much!

I'm sorry, you all have to take out your shoes before we go in for meditation.

There's one question some person has asked about severe types of bronchitis. Who is the gentleman who has said he has got very bad bronchitis? So he come and see us here, later on.

You are? All right. Please be seated we'll see him after the session, all right ?

Is there any question left now?

What?

Now, somebody said that when he puts these two fingers (ed: thumb and indexfinger) he gets a Cool Breeze. That means these two fingers are not all right. There is no need to close any fingers in Sahaja Yoga. So you have to keep - all these Mudras - all these touching of fingers has a meaning. We also use that when there are problems. We also use Hatha Yoga exercises whenever it is needed - whatever is needed, there is a science behind it. But normally they are not so much needed.

Somebody was asking a question if I was the Holy Ghost that Christ has promised to send. I've told you already I'm not going to tell you about Myself. Because Christ was the only Son of God. And He is the gate and He is the path. But [inaudible ?] have crucified Him. Human beings are very funny. False people say, "I'm God" - they start worshipping. When Rajneesh said he is God everybody was worshipping him. But a real person says something they'll murder the person. So I want you to find out about Me, but first of all find out about yourself. Because I still want to work, I don't want to get crucified. (Shri Mataji laughing)

So, most of the questions I have answered, I think, in My lectures.

If there are any other questions left you can come to our follow-on program and ask them. But any amount of questions you get answering is again the same net of words. You have to get your Realization, which I cannot guarantee you. Which you should get - that's My desire. That's what I want. It should work out.

Those who don't want to have their Self Realization should please go away, because as it is I cannot force it. But if you stay here you may disturb other people. So to be civil you should go, if you don't want your Realization.

I've requested you to take out your shoes and put them parallel on the floor. Now put both the feet apart from each other as these represent two channels within us - left sympathetic and right sympathetic. So the problems of these two sympathetic nervous system will pass out to the Mother Earth. Because She is very kind and She sucks in all our problems.

So, please put your left hand towards Me like this. Because this represents your desire to get Realization and the right hand represents the action. Of course you don't have to do anything but I'm just doing this for you to know how later on you can always raise your Kundalini.

Because in the beginning it's a very thin - just like your hair - the energy flows onto the top of your head. And then when it opens it a little bit the grace falls onto your sympathetic nervous system, relaxes your chakras and then more energy starts flowing. But you can help later on raise your Kundalini more. Like the sprouting of the seed is spontaneous - effortless, but later on you have to look after it till it becomes a proper tree.

All right. Now please put your left hand like this. Sit very comfortably. Don't push your head backwards or forwards, but be in the center, no pressure on the neck. And first and foremost thing is that you must forgive yourself. Your body is the temple of God and you should not get angry with yourself. You should feel very pleasantly towards yourself.

Now, I'll show you which chakras to be touched, one by one. We are working only on the left hand side with the right hand.

Now, put the right hand on your heart where resides the Spirit.

Now, put this right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Now here is the center of your mastery. When this center opens you become the master.

So now, you take it down in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center through which we work out the pure knowledge of Kundalini and that of Divine laws.

Then again we go back, put our hand on the left hand side on the upper part of your abdomen and press it hard.

Then we go back again on the heart.

Then we put our right hand in the corner of the shoulder and our head from the front side like that. And turn our head to the right. Hold it tight. This is the center which is always caught very badly. This is the center which makes us feel guilty. Please forgive yourself. You are not guilty at all, you are the epitome of evolution. Don't judge yourself. God will judge you in His compassion.

Now, put your hand on top of your forehead and press it on both the sides like this. This is the center of Christ, of forgiveness.

Now you take this hand on the back side of your head and allow your head to rest on it, put all the pressure.

Now stretch your hand - fully. Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone, which was a soft bone in your childhood - like this. And put the left hand towards Me, bend your head and press it seven times your scalp slowly, slowly clockwise. Seven times.

That's all now. So we start.

We start it now by closing our eyes and putting our left hand towards Myself. Please put both the feet apart, and also you can take out your spectacles or anything that is heavy anywhere.

Now close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. Close your eyes. Put your right hand on your heart. Ask the question, a very fundamental question to Me - you may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you. So here you ask the question, a very fundamental question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" It's like asking the computer. Ask this question three times please.

Now, if you are the Spirit you are the master of yourself. So, now please take down your right hand on the left side of your stomach and press it hard. Here ask another question which follows, "Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guru? Mother, am I my own guide?" Whichever you like, you ask this question three times.

Now, take down this right hand on the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you have to say, because I cannot force, it's your freedom which is to be respected. You have to say, "Mother, please may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, please give me pure knowledge." You say it six times, because this center has six petals.

Please put your right hand on the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side, some people are not keeping it there. And say, "Please Mother, give me pure knowledge of the Divine." Say it six times.

Now, raise your hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. This is the center of your mastery. Because you have asked for the pure knowledge Kundalini has started moving. We have to help open this chakra - this center. With full confidence in yourself please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master." Ten times please.

Now, raise your right hand on your heart and say twelve times with full confidence the fundamental truth about yourself, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Please say it twelve times.

You have to know the Divine is the Ocean of Love and Ocean of Bliss, but above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness. So, whatever mistakes you commit are not greater than this Ocean. So forgive yourself. Forget the past. Please now, put your hand, right hand on the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right. This center is caught when you feel guilty. So, please say 16 times with full confidence in yourself, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." If you still think you are guilty, you better have the punishment of saying it 108 times. (Shri Mataji laughing) I have already told you that you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now, stretch your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides. Now here you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." Not how many times, but from your heart. Many people think it is difficult, but it is a myth. If you don't forgive or forgive you do not do anything, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So please say it from your heart. Yesterday everybody did not say it from their hearts. That's why they couldn't get their Realization. You say it, sincerely that, "Mother, I forgive everyone." Just say that. It's the greatest weapon you have got.

Now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head and place your head upwards, holding it with your hand. In this center you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction, "Oh Divine, if we have done anything wrong, please forgive us - or forgive me." But don't count your mistakes.

So now, stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of your head and stretch your fingers, press it hard, as much as you can easily, and turn it seven times clockwise and hold your head bent forward.

(Shri Mataji blowing into the microphone)

Now, please take down your hand. Please open your eyes.

Now, put your right hand towards Me like this. Bend your head and see if you get a Cool Breeze out of your head. Above, get it above.

Now, put the left hand towards Me, bend your head and see with your right hand if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head.

Now, put your right hand towards Me. And see again, bending your head, with the left hand if there is a Cool Breeze coming out

Now, raise both your hands in the air and put your head back - and ask a question, "Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the All pervading Power of God's Love? Is it Brahmachaitanya? Is it Ruh?" Just ask these questions in your heart.

Put down your hands please.

Now, those who have felt Cool Breeze out of their heads or out of their hands please raise both your hands.

All of you have felt it. May God bless you!

But now you have to attend our follow on where you don't have to pay any money - nothing. But you mature you Realization. You have to respect your Realization. And you'll understand about it. Supposing somebody gives Me a Schilling and I do not spend it - how will I know its value? In the same way we have to use this power. For yourself and for others.

First thing that will happen to you is that you feel very relaxed. And sometimes they feel on top of the world. But still come to the follow-on and establish yourself. Otherwise the Kundalini may fall down, if it is not established.

May God bless you all!

If you want to meet Me you can come to the stage.

Shri Mataji: So, how are you?

You feel guilty. Why do you feel guilty? Don't feel guilty. Just don't feel guilty.

You have it, you're so cold, just see. All right?

Are you feeling the Cool Breeze or not? That's all. (Shri Mataji laughing) Now you will know what it is, you have to use it. Then you will know it. All right?

[inaudible ?]

You felt the Cool Breeze? No? What's the matter?

[inaudible ?]

Sahaja Yogi: He's an architect, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Architecture? Ask a question, "Is Go the architect of all the architects?" You have been to some guru before? Are you feeling it now? So, remember that God is the architect of all the architects.

Did you feel it? Good, good. Nice, nice. May God bless you! Did you feel the Cool Breeze in your hands? What's the matter?

[inaudible ?]

Sahaja Yogi: She works too much in the garden.

Shri Mataji: You should use gloves. Gardening is good work but you must use gloves, all right? They hurt you? Now you use your gloves, your hands are important, because now the Cool Breeze is coming in, all right ?

[inaudible ?]

Sahaja Yogi: He feels cool, but numb. He feels block on this finger.

Shri Mataji: That's because he feels guilty again. This is the center for feeling guilty.

Sahaja Yogi: He smokes.

Shri Mataji: And then you feel guilty after smoking. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Sahaja Yogi: He wants to stop smoking.

Shri Mataji: You will. Whatever you feel like, you will stop smoking. It's good, you are a seeker, you will stop in no time.

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: What do you do?

Sahaja Yogi: She is a teacher.

Shri Mataji: Ask a question, "Mother, are you the teacher of all the teachers?" Just ask the question three times.

You've got it. You have got the Cool Breeze now?

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: Are you catholic? Then ask the question about the Holy Ghost.

Now try to recognize. It starts. May God bless you!

Now you have to come to the follow up and become an expert.

[inaudible ?]

Felt it or not? Not so much.

Seeker: Allah ho akbar.

Shri Mataji: Feel it? The connection is established.

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: So, how do you feel?

Sahaja Yogi: She said she isn't sure. She doesn't feel very much.

Shri Mataji: What does she do?

Sahaja Yogi: Programming - another computer specialist.

Shri Mataji: Put your hand on right Swadhisthan. Ask the question about the computer.

Seeker: Shri Mataji, are You the computer of all the computers?

Shri Mataji: All right?

Sahaja Yogi: It's cool. Yes. She says it's cool.

Seeker: Shri Mataji, You are the computer of all the computers.

Shri Mataji: Better. The heat [is coming ?]. Now better? I'm giving you cool and I'm [coming hot ?]. (Laughter)

All right. So now it's all right? Feeling the Cool now? All right. On your head?

Very good. Excellent. So now you've become a real computer. You can ask a question and you get the answer. Because you are the biggest computer that God has created, you see. It's all programmed. Do you understand? Everything is programmed - you ask a question and answer is there. All right?

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: Have you been to a guru or something? Put your hand here (ed: left Nabhi). Say, "I am my own master."

Seeker: Shri Mataji, I am my own master.

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: May God bless you, My child, may God bless you!

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: And tomorrow I'm going to Graz. And [we ?] are going to work it out there. I had such a nice time and [met ?] such nice people. They all got their Realization and are very much with us. Now we have so many people in Austria. It's a great thing. So - long live Austria!

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: Enjoy it. [It's the big part. ?] enjoying each other. We have to show the world that all the Sahaja Yogis can live very happily with each other. Cleanse yourself, do meditation, cleanse yourself. And you'll be all right.

[inaudible ?]

Shri Mataji: All right.

Sahaja Yogis: Sahasrara Mantra

Sahaja Yogi: Bolo Shri Jagadamaba Shri Dakshinamurti Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai !

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all! May God bless you all! May God bless you all!

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
