1976-02-29 Mahashivaratri Puja: Utpatti - Adi Shakti aur Shiva ka Swaroop, Mumbai

[Talk in Hindi]

I have told you about the origin before. Because on the day of Mahashivratri, when there is a talk about Shivji then it has to begin with origin. How much He is primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God almighty. 

He is called as Sadashiva when He is enlightened from Bramha. That is why the one who is Shivji is called as Adi (primordial). 
You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree its seed has to be seen first and that is why it has to be called ‘Beej Swaroopa’- form of the seed. That is why the glory of Shiva is very important. After that, after his manifestation, the power within him gets her form and is called as Adishakti. 

The same Adishakti enlightens the three forms of the God differently which you know as Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh i.e. Shivshankar. 
It means that Adishakti holds the three aspects of a diamond. 
And when in the dooms day the whole created universe, whole manifested world gets dissolved and the same is incarnated in the form of Brahma, then also Sadashiva remains there. 
And his connection to the part of God is always maintained which is never manifested and which is a non-being. 
The powers of the God which are manifested come from being and those which are non-manifested are always remained in non-being. In that the place of Sadashiva is that of a diamond. Even if a diamond is broken, scattered, however much is erased, even it is broken into many pieces then also it keeps on shining. Its shining is never destroyed. 

In the same way there is a place of Sadashiva. Existence comes from Sadashiva and unless and until there develops a condition for the creation of the world no creativity will take place. 
First the condition is made. 
Existence of anything has to be brought up. Existence comes from the power of Sadashiva. 
Therefore, his role in creation is just like a foundation of a very big building or mansion. It is not seen, a foundation is never seen but without that no building can stand. 

In the same way Sadashiva being Atmaswaroopa - in the form of spirit, resides in our heart. Our existence in this world continues till he is there in our heart in the form of spirit. 

The day he closes his eyes, we are finished, very same day. We move out of this world and we start continuing in parloka (next world). 

Shivji you know resides in our Chandra nadi and while sitting on Chandra nadi he continues to do all work of the existence but he also continues to run our life. 

Without Shivji we cannot continue to exist. Now these are very lengthy talks which I have described quite openly in my book.

The form of Shivji, he is an absolute Sanyasi-ascetic. As there is a form of God which is ascetic within, he does not create out of any reason, there is no reason. He does it on his own; it is his whim, his pleasure. 
If he wants then he creates otherwise he destroys it. He is a symbol of all those people who are ascetic in the world. You all know that by asceticism I do not mean to be what it is considered in the world. The one who has become a witness after reaching a state of being self realized is to be called a Sanyastha-ascetic. 
He is ascetic from inside. Even when living outside in the whole world he is greatest sanyasi. In this case, he does not need to tell anybody that I am a sanyasi, I have taken sanyasa. But the mind who takes sanyasa (asceticism) from within, which becomes sanyastha (ascetic) from within, that form is of Shri Shiva. 
And while we reside in this world and do the worldly work and whatever we enjoy, is a bhokta (enjoyer) form of God, is his form as Vishnu. That is why in the form of Vishnu he is the enjoyer, he is ascetic in the form of Shiva and is creator in the form of Brahma, the creator. 
While looking at this ascetic (sanyasi) a strange thing is seen, his body of blue pigment, because he is residing in the line of moon, snakes are entangled around his throat and on hands, all his ornamentation is arranged from snakes. Snakes are cool, are peaceful and drink combustion and he is sustaining the snakes on him. 

Means whatever the evil of the world, whatever is anti, whatever is the sting, whatever are the tremendous things that are destroying the world, he is containing them all in his body. 

While drinking the poison of the whole world, you all know this that he drank the whole poison in the beginning and whatever is the poison of the world drinking that he keeps this world cool and give happiness to the world. 
Whatever thing that becomes dead, finished, all that is resided in his kingdom and those who are greatest evil, there prison get closed from the dust of his feet. 
By the blessing of Shivji they are imprisoned. There is a kingdom of moon on his forehead. Moon is spontaneous brother of Laxmi and that’s why it is called that he has kept his brother-in-law on his forehead. 
The poets have made a very strange kind of his description and he has taken the burden of Ganga on his head very beautifully. 
As if he is the remover of the ego of all the beings. He has contained in his jatas(tress), egoist as Ganga, so much tremendous are his jatas. He also drinks ego which is there in human beings and that is how he protects this world from egoist people. 

He is incomparable; he cannot be described in words. But he has a very big; a very extraordinary power which is not there in any deity and that is the power of forgiveness. He can also forgive greatest of evils, to whom Ganeshji cannot forgive, to whom Jesus cannot forgive, even these can be forgiven by Sadashiva. 
That is why always whenever there is forgiveness to be asked (here Shri Mataji says in Marathi to somebody - don’t talk during meditation) then it has to be asked from him.
Because of there are some things that Ganesha cannot forgive, which we call as sin against the mother. Whatsoever are sex sins - Ganesha never forgive them, cannot forgive. It is very difficult to convince him, also Jesus Christ cannot forgive, just cannot. 

For them there is only Mahadeva, Shri Shankar is capable. His order cannot be disobeyed by them .That is why he is to be worshipped. 

It is very surprising why people fast on the Mahashivratri day. I am not able to understand on which basis this ritual has been made. Either it has been written by some mischievous people in the Shastra (scriptures). 
Today he drank the poison, so you are also permitted to eat anything! And you have made out; you are also permitted to eat anything that we may take poison and do fast today. 

Today there is a heavy pressure getting in my heart, the sahaja yogi who has taken fast today is pulling my heart. Sahaja yogis should not follow anything blind fondly. 
They should think that the day when he achieved victory by drinking poison is the day of celebration. In the world who has told to die fasting when there is so big festival of the same Shivji? Human beings eat a little more on day when they are happy. 
Today is the day of eating two more rotis (bread). Today everyone is on fast and that is why Shivji is very angry with all. And this is the thing even Shivji cannot forgive. Now how will you get your wellbeing. That is why so many shiv bhaktas gets heart attack early. 

Today is the day of celebrating happiness because he drank all the poison of the world, whatever was non-benevolent, whatever was sin, whatever was evil spread in the world he consumed all of them. We should not do this kind of unauspicious job on this great celebrating day of such Shivji. 
If we fast on someone’s birthday then, what will we do on his death? All the opposite business continues here, when someone is dead then the Brahmins eat sitting together, when someone is born then all the people of family fast sitting together! 
How to convince, on which Shastras (scriptures) there is basis of this? And also in shastras greatest of fools have filled this kind of things. 
Whomever you see, he has filled in his Shastra all the atrocities. This thought should be kept in mind that what is the meaning of fasting on this day. All should eat sweets because all the people in the temple want to eat sweet. So sweets should be offered. 

Now they will have Bhang (Indian intoxicating leafy drug) and Charas (Indian intoxicant like tobacco) all the night and would say that Shivji also used to take it so we will also have it. Shivji takes Charas and Bhang for the reason of going to sub-conscious. He may eat anything he want, what does it matter to him. For example to understand that you have to go somewhere on aeroplane, then you should be pilot first. 

Then they cannot be Shivji by eating Charas and Bhang. It is the Shivji who draw the poison and he is the one who is exploiting all the type of Bhang by drinking all the Bhang of the entire world. 
So, that where this bhang is to be dumped? That is why it is dumped within him requesting to him, that you are Shivji please drink it. Kindly drink poison, kindly drink bhang. 

All the people have gone to drink bhang today to become Shivji! How many of you are equal to the dust of feet of Shivji? 
He drinks bhang because the store of bhang is kept within him. There is bhang in the world, there are devils also, and evils are also there, where to put them all? 
In your house if there is such a thing to keep it, then there has to be some arrangement. 
Shivji told ‘let me drink the poison of the whole world.’ That is why these things are stored in him that please you keep it with you. 

Therefore, all of you who drink bhang and charas in his name, there is no other greatest fool in the whole world than you. 
There is a thought for sahaja yogis that you have never felt vibrations, you have not yet known that what a thing is this, what is that flowing through you, what is that happening inside you? Something new, something very great, something is of a special form. 
Then your own thoughts should be changed, your habits also need to be changed. 
Why we always do adversarial things I just cannot understand. 

And every adversarial thing turn out to be such adversarial that Shivji has got up from this world and it is very difficult to make him sit again and if he stands for long time then he start dancing Tandava, he has no limits. 


Therefore everyone should behave in a thoughtful way. Today is his very, very great day. Promise today that by next Mahashivratri there will be a big celebration, he will be praised. 
May be he does not like ornaments like those of Vishnuji; his ornaments are of different kind. For him you may apply babhut - ashes of incense stick, you may offer the whole of ashes to him, he is agreed to all, but has he ever talked of fast? I just do not know this fact. 

Fasting word has been changed. Fasting has become the meaning of determination. 
Fasting should be done on the time when Shri Ram went for exile then you should fast. When there is a matter of repentance, occasion of fasting is understandable. Now are you repenting that he has drunk poison? 
This is an issue of consideration. 

Calamity of the whole world, troubles of the whole world, the poison of the whole world he drank on this great day. 
Therefore today is called as Mahashivratri. He has taken the whole of night, the whole of darkness, he consumed within himself. 
I do not force on you, but try to do it. 
You should determine now that you will not do fast at all on Mahashivratri and see how tremendously vibrations come and ask for forgiveness.
