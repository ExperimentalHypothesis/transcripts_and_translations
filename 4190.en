Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule (India), 25 December 1995.

Happy Christmas to all of you.

It is a great day when Christ came on this Earth and you know about how He was specially created to come down as a human being to work out the salvation of the people.

It is said that He came to India, in Kashmir, and He met there the King Shalivahana. It’s all in Sanskrit, I’ve read that the conversation took place between Christ and King Shalivahana who was a great devotee of the Mother.

Then he asked him, “What is your name?” In Sanskrit it’s all written. So He said, “I come from a country where people believe in filth and I think this is My own country.”

So Shalivahana said, “You are such a great person who has come on this Earth, so you should go back to those countries to save them and to tell them about the pure principle of life.”

In Sanskrit it was written “Nirmala Tattwam” (pure principle). And Christ went back and after three and a half years only, He was crucified. These were special days. I call them the days of tapasya. Same time Buddha and Mahavira were born at the same level of the Virata’s forehead.

As you know that, according to Vedas, there are seven awarenesses we can go through or the subtle qualities we have within ourselves.

The first one was the bhuh. Bhuh is Ganesha was created.

Second is bhurvah, meaning ‘antariksha’, means all that is created around us.

The third one is swaha at Nabhi Chakra.

Swaha is the one where you consume everything. It’s - in modern times, you see, people go on consuming everything. All kinds of books they will read, they’ll go to all kinds of things and if you tell them, “Why do you do it?” [They say] “What’s wrong?” “Why do you dress up like this?” “What’s wrong?”

This just consumption of everything goes on.

But then, at that time, also there is another great thing within us, it’s called as swadha, where we sustain the dharma within us – swadha. Dharma of everything.

See, those people who say there should be no blind faith and this and that. It’s not blind, but it’s an inner urge.

Why we love our parents? Because there’s a dharma within us. Why do we live - believe in our country? Because there’s a dharma within us. All these dharmas is there. Why a wife loves her husband? Because there is dharma. Why the husband loves the wife? Because there is dharma. When this dharma is within you. We don’t call it religion because it can mean something else.

This one is sustaining, dharayati. Once it is sustained within ourselves, it becomes swadha.

That’s our capacity, that’s our quality. We can call it an innate understanding.

Some of them are even in the animals, like attachment to parents, attachment to their masters.

Then comes the higher awareness where your mana. Now, it’s not mind, because very confusion, there’s a big confusion with “mind,” you see. English language is really quite confusing.

Mana means “by which we have emotions.”

Now, recently I read that they are now talking about, not only of IQ, but EQ, means emotional coefficients. That means a person who has only intelligence is not alright. He must also have the balance of emotions. They are coming to it now, but first they only used to only praise people who have IQ. That’s not the situation. So now, it is different, perhaps they are realising that through intelligence how people have created chaos, violence, all kinds of destruction on this Earth. So now they are talking about a higher capacity within us called as EQ, which capacity is emotional.

This emotional capacity comes to you as an inner urge, as an inner capability, which you cannot avoid.

A person may be anything in life, but if he has no love, if he hasn’t got any emotional feelings, then he is not complete.

Now these emotional things also could be very limited, no doubt. They could be something that gets attached to somebody, or something can happen; as also the IQ, where we get attached to some idea.

Like Hitler had some idea and he believed that it was the truth and he has to do it.

So when you get attached to one idea like that, you can just do things, which are not at all helpful, supportive or nourishing to Reality.

All these things have happened: wars, destruction, also, as you see nowadays, the people are trying to secretly destroy others.

All these are coming as the anti-feeling, where the mana has developed a domination of the intelligence, where emotions are dominated by intelligence and rationality.

So there is another awareness within us, another capability within us, another urge within us, innately built is the jana. Jana means the people, the communication.

You cannot live alone. You see, a man who goes to jail, he is quite happy, he is quite comfortable, he doesn’t have to do any work. Everything is done for him. If he has a good class, he lives very well, much better than he would live outside. But the only thing is he cannot meet other people. He cannot communicate.

And when this capacity of communication – which is within us, I mean, which is a part and parcel of human existence – is taken away, a person in the jail feels absolutely frustrated and unhappy. He doesn’t mind labouring, doing all kinds of menial work as long as he is not in the jail, cut out of the communications with others.

So this communication is also an inner urge within us. (Indistinct word: “Good”?) In that also, people sometimes go too far and neglect other dharmas. They are more bothered about communication than about other dharmas, which are very important. So there is no balance in a person.

Then comes the sixth awareness within us, which is a very interesting thing. One was where we take to conditionings. Say, if I’m an Indian, then I’m very proud of Indians. I can never see anything wrong with them or I may see everything wrong with them.

It can be both ways.

How you have been conditioned is the point, and this conditioning comes to us through our sixth centre of Agnya.

And the another thing that we develop when somebody tries to condition us or to control us, we try to get out of it or sometimes we try to dominate. This dominating capacity is also within us, innately built.

Both things are innately built within us that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.

For example, I would say that in a very stupid, silly manner (Shri Mataji laughs) people get conditioned. Is impossible to get them out of it. It always comes out of self-centredness that a person has no value for understanding. Like, now, somebody comes to your house, he is a vegetarian. Alright, now he stays with you.

So: “I’m a vegetarian. You must get new utensils to cook the food because I can’t have food in the utensils where the meat is cooked!” Alright.

Then “You must get your servant in a proper manner, so send him to some place where you can get the well water”. The servant must be absolutely drenched – this is typical Indian old style – and should go and draw the water from the well and bring it for drinking and cooking, while the servant dies of pneumonia doesn’t matter. All such stupid conditionings we have.

But it’s not only that in the East you find all these conditionings. The West is even worse. For example, they have clubbing. Now there are clubs where people wear particular type of clothes. It’s a club. Now if they wear something else, then everybody will laugh at them.

Or how to use the spoon and fork is very important in the West.

How they use spoon and fork – specially English have this nonsensical conditioning. If somebody uses the fork and spoon in a wrong way, then finished. He is nowhere. He is not sophisticated.

The ideas of sophistication and all that comes through conditionings of ages because maybe they were primitive to begin with. They had no clothes, proper clothes to wear. Might be they were covering themselves with some leaves or something, I mean, only hundreds of years back.

So now, they have jumped to the other side, very particular about their dress, very particular about fork and spoon. And they just can’t bear something that is different. “I don’t like that” is very common there. “I don’t like. I don’t like.”

Now, they came to India, “We don’t like!” “What you don’t like?” “We don’t like the way Indians dress up!” Alright, you dress up the way you like. Let Indians dress up the way they like.

Now why do you think that your dress in England will suit here in India, which is such a hot, hot, hot country?” But: “No! This is how we are.” It’s quite funny the way they have [conditionings – ed.]. And this conditioning goes on into such a deep manner that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.

For example, if the queen has invited you, you must wear a tailcoat. And now it’s very expensive to have a tailcoat. You know, they have to go to a particular shop to borrow it. Sometimes they are loose and sometimes they are tight. I have seen people coming to these parties, Queen’s parties, I could never recognise them because somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin or somebody looked like Laurel or somebody like Hardy (laughter). I couldn’t make out who are these people.

Then I was told he is – “That’s such-and-such ambassador”. “Oh my God, I know him very well. What has happened to him?”.

They cannot walk straight. Their gait changes because of the clothes, which are so tight sometimes and sometimes so loose. But – you have to wear. All these formal ideas come to us as a kind of a part and parcel of you because you accept all these conditionings.

So the other side it goes to that “We abandon all this. We don’t want all this”, the anti-culture. So I met one gentleman who was wearing a pant, which had lots of holes in it. Imagine in the cold of London to wear a pant like that! So I said, “Why do you want to wear a pant which has holes?” He said, “This is a holey pant.” Holey?!” (Laughter)

“My goodness. It will give you varicose veins. It’s horrible!” “What’s wrong? We are anti-culture people, so we are taking now to holey pants.”

I mean such stupid people are, not only who are uneducated, but very well-educated people, highly-placed people are so conditioned, and this conditioning has caused so much damage to human beings.

For example, to accept Freud had become just a complete religion in the West. Freud became Christ at that level, though he was a Jew, and he dominated the Western culture so much that I just couldn’t understand the impact of this stupid man who would have been thrown in the sea if he had come to India.

But the conditioning part is everything is written is law. And they accepted this man so much that the culture of the West became absolutely self-destructive throughout.

No respect, no morality, nothing was lofty, all value system shattered, because they accepted this kind of nonsense because it was written.

Even today, I hear “in such-and-such book such is written; in that book such-and-such thing is written.” This is terrible conditioning. For example, it’s written in the Bible that Jews crucified Christ. Nonsense! Just use your brains!

How can Jews crucify Christ? They were in a multitude. In any country have you heard that a person can be crucified with the general opinion of the people?

It’s the government, the Roman government did that. But to put the blame on the Jews was a very good idea of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul and people accepted that because it suited them to hate the Jews.

Then the Jews started creating people like Freud.

So all such conditionings also have reactions, and these conditionings then build up and once they build up, their reactions also build up, and you have a country full of all kinds of chaos, fear, violence and destruction.

The conditioning is more, also, with the idea of possession. “This is my land. This possession is mine, that is this, that.” Like this it goes up to a point where people who believed in the formless God also fight for the land. Why should they? They believe in the formless God, so why should they fight for the land?

But they’ll go on fighting for the land, and this fighting for the land can go to any extent of very cruel things that whole country can work out.

Conditionings are of every kind, if you see are blinding your eyes.

For example, they believe in Koran.

Simple thing is, Koran was never written by Mohammed Sahib. He never knew how to read and write. It’s a fact. For 40 years it was not written. There was a fellow called Muawiyah, or something like that, who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons. He was the second kalipha. The first one died very early.

Then he killed the third one also. Then he killed the fourth one, just to become himself the kalipha. And the liver of this fourth kalipha was eaten by the mother of this horrible fellow, who hated women. So he puts it down in the Koran, all the things against women, and people accept it because it’s in the Koran!

Somebody has made fun of Koran and written what’s wrong and it’s all stupidities and all that. So I asked him: “What is the use of writing this book. What is the use?” He said: “I never thought of the use”.

“Then why did you write? It must have some use. It’s a useless book.” - I said - “It’s only useful that by reading this all the people who are Muslims will – (Shri Mataji corrects Herself) who are not Muslims will laugh at Islam, and those who are Muslims will say, ‘Wa! Well, this is our book. Whatever it says, we believe in it. We are conditioned like that.’ So, you don’t solve the problem.” So he said: “Then what should I do?”.

I said, “You write another book saying that, ‘It’s all stupidity I’ve written of Koran because I know it was not written by Mohammed Sahib’. Don’t write anything of Mohammed Sahib, against him. He is the One who is the incarnation of Dattatreya. It’s a fact. So you write that he never wrote it, so all these people have done all these things”.

This conditioning can be removed if you know what sort of life Christ led, very important.

First of all, He was born in a manger.

To be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance.

That means He showed there’s no need to have money or there’s no need to have a huge, big properties or anything to be impressive on people. Those were the days where people respected the tapasvis, the ones who were doing tapasya. That was the time to do tapasya.

So He came on this Earth and lived like a tapasvi. On the contrary, the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you could think of. You go to any Christian nation you’ll be amazed how they are just slaves of money and their watches.

How they are living, it’s very shocking to see they are ‘following’ Christ. “Yes, we follow Christ.” Then follow means what? He is there and you are standing backwards moving. Is that the following?

If you see the Catholic Church or even Protestants you’ll be shocked. How are they following Christ I can’t understand.

Until now, I never understood. Because Catholic is nothing but money-oriented. The only thing they have picked up from Christ that He went to a wedding and created wine out of water and distributed.

Now this wine is just the juice of the grapes.

Is also called wine in the Hebrew language.

Thank God, I’ve read Bible in Hebrew translated directly. So it’s called draksharas (‘grape juice’ in Sanskrit) because instantly you cannot create alcohol. It has to rot, rot, rot and the more it rots the more good it is, they say. They write it down, this is 25 years old, so is the price is much. But if it is three hundred year old, the price is exorbitant.

So it has to rot and smell like hell, then only it’s a good alcohol – is a fact. How could Christ create that instant, that moment, alcohol?

But now, what I find is this, that if somebody dies, they will take champagne - to celebrate what? Good riddance of bad rubbish? (Laughter)

Or when somebody is born, they will do it, but on Christmas Day especially, after coming from church don’t go to any Christian’s house!

Even the Indian Christians have started following the Western people because Indian Christians believe that Christ was born in England! (Laughter)

All such ideas have come from where? Is because the English and the Portuguese and the French brought Christianity to us. Now, by any chance, are they Christians? What business they had to bring Christianity to this place? They took Christianity to all the places, specially Spanish.

Spanish, Portuguese went round the whole world to spread Christianity and today is the mess that you see in those people. They are nothing but drunkards.

Yesterday I was going back and the sea was full of happiness and joy and the water had reached a very high level. It happens with Me. But what I found, there were four, five Christians coming, singing carols and just completely drunk and I was thinking they’ll be drowned in this water very soon.

This was the great boon of Christianity on human beings that you can drink as much as you like.

Now, this drinking has come, I should say, from where, God alone knows, but it has come also from the Christians. And the Muslims also drink, no doubt, but they hide and drink, they don’t openly drink and don’t call it’s a religious duty that you should drink. Imagine, in the church when they give communication, they give you some sort of a dirty smelling wine. After that how can you have communication? Once you are drunk, you are finished! (Laughter) But all these things happen.

So, today we are talking about Christ. He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra controlling pineal and pituitary.

By that, He controls our conditionings.

If we follow Him, then we cannot be conditioned by anything, because He talked of Spirit only. Spirit cannot be conditioned, conditioned by anything. Whatever is good, that will be accepted, good, congenial to the Spirit. It’s a different attitude of a person who is spiritual.

Like we had people here, I know they are not very comfortable. Some of them are put into these tents here and there, but they are enjoying because they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere. They don’t care where they sleep, where they live, what they have. This is all because you have entered into the kingdom of God.

But those who have not, so much worried [complain], “This is not good. I want this way, that way.” All material happiness they seek, trouble everybody, criticise everybody, get angry with everybody. But actually they haven’t got spiritual joy. And they can never be really in joy unless and until they become fully spiritual.

Christ has openly said that – you have to know yourself. Same in Koran.

Mohammed Sahib has said, “Unless and until you know yourself, you will not know God.” There are lots of truths in Koran I find left over by this Muawiya and also in the Bible.

Also in the Jews, I find their Torah and all that has lots of Truth, but is covered by all this kind of thinking, rationality and adjustments they have done for their own use.

Actually, we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion. Never! None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham, He’s talked about Moses, He’s talked about Christ and His Mother much more than in the Bible. Respected Her! And he said there have been more than one lakh (100,000) walis, means realised souls before. But still Muslims are some sort of a “unique” people because they call themselves Muslims. Whether they drink, doesn’t matter, whether they womanise doesn’t matter, they kill people doesn’t matter. They are running after few things, which are forbidden to them, but still they are Muslims. Same with the Christians. Difficult to find a man who is a real Christian, who follows Christ, before realisation. After realisation, of course, you are different, but for that you have to cross this Agnya.

Agnya also is there which has to control your ego. Christ, in His lifetime showed how ego works. His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ, such a great incarnation of purity, was crucified, shows what people are like, what they did to Him, how He was troubled and tortured by these stupid people and then how He was crucified by the government there.

In the beginning there were many sahaja yogis, I should say they were called as gnostics – “gn” in Sanskrit means knowledge – who had the knowledge about Self. Christ has said, “Thou shalt” – He said that “Know thy-self.” “You have to knock at the door” – meaning you must have shuddha iccha, otherwise it won’t work out. Nobody can force you.

He controls the ego. He is the one who gives you the balance. But, if you go to the West, you know they are nothing but some sort of a stupid, donkey-like ego! The way they talk, the way they behave towards each other, it’s a big eye-opener. They are developed. How are they developed, God knows. “Oh, they are very advanced, sophisticated, this, that.”

With this Agnya catching, Christ has said in His Lord’s Prayer, “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us.”

What a big thing to say. But one thing I have seen in the West, people don’t know how to forgive. They are full of hatred. And they cannot ask forgiveness because they are full of terrible ego. Though they will feel guilty, but they will never ask for forgiveness. They’ll never say that, “Oh God, forgive me for what I have done.” This is so common now.

For example, the Nazis, they killed so many people and still you find this neo-Nazis coming up, even in Italy! They are not ashamed as to what they have done.

This happens because there is no, really, connection with Christ. Firstly, if you have connection with Christ, your ego has to be finished. Absolutely.

And this ego, which comes to you from various sources, is a myth. It’s a myth. With this ego, people try to befool others and show off.

Like there’s a story of Shahpesh (‘The Punishment of Khilpil’ by George Meredith). I don’t know if you have read about him. He (Khilpil) came to a King (Shahpesh) and told him that “I’m a great architect and I’ll build a big palace for you, and this and that.” The way he posed, the king believed him. He said, “Alright. Go ahead. I’ll send you so much money.”

Now, with this whole attitude and the way he was describing himself, with all his gestures, full of such ego, that this king also got completely lost. He gave him lots of money. And in six months’ time he came back, said, “I have built your palace. Come and have a look.”

He went there, he saw it was just the same land. There was no palace, nothing. So king thought “Something gone wrong with him or what?”. He was again looking and looking, and what does he find? He finds there was no palace, nothing. Immediately he realised that this ego has befooled him.

So, the king was very clever that way. He realised it. So he started saying, “See, this is the main road by which we’ll go and there’s the palace. Now the door opens.” Nothing there. It’s all just a story. “And now here is your throne and please be seated on that.” He said, “First you sit.” He made this Shahpesh (Khilpil) to sit on a throne which never existed.

Now imagine, it was very painful. He said, “You sit, I want to see you sitting there. I like it.” For one hour he made him sit. For two hours he made him sit.

Ultimately, Shahpesh (Khilpil) fell at his feet and he said, “Sir, I’m sorry. There is no palace. There is no throne. Nothing of the kind.”

But the king had lost all his money and so he imprisoned him. He was beaten up and did all kinds of things.

So this is the end of false ideas about oneself. This ego can take you to such a heights of stupidity. And the culture where it is pampered, is the worst culture.

I have seen advertisements where they say “you must smoke this particular cigarette because it expresses your ego.”

But according to Indian culture to express your ego is absolutely something very stupid, people laugh at such a person, the one who tries to show his ego. In Marathi language if somebody is trying to show off, then they say he is climbing on a small little shrub of chana (chick peas).

It’s the whole system is such, so nobody can develop any ego. If they develop, then they are corrected. Specially in Maharashtra, it’s very difficult to develop any ego. As soon as you start talking big about yourself, immediately you are punctured.

But in the North, of course, is little bit allowed, I think, and people do talk big. “We are great politicians who talk very big. I’m going to do this. I’m going to do that. We are going to have this project, that project, this, that.”

One thing, Christ never said such a thing. Never He talked [like that].

What - if you see His sermons, it’s so deep and so enlightening, despite the effort of this gentleman, Mr. Paul, you see Christ talking to people, giving them different ways of explanation - what happens after realisation, how a seed is sprouted and how it can get spoiled - and very beautifully He explained to people. But I think had, didn’t have much effect at that time.

His life was so charming and so beautiful. Like a shooting star He came on this Earth, but He left such a remarkable impression on people.

His crucifixion was a part of the game because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra. To cross the Agnya Chakra He was crucified. But His message is not crucifixion. People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it.

He crucified Himself, but that’s not the message, that’s not [what] you should celebrate, that He crucified. There are people who celebrate it! You have to celebrate His resurrection, the Resurrection because human beings are to be resurrected.

In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ. That was enough! That was sufficient. You can’t carry the cross on your shoulders, you don’t have to. He has carried for you. He has done everything for you. Is said also that He died for all the sinners – is a fact.

If He had not done that, it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas because two problems, I told you: is conditionings and ego. His crucifixion has helped the loosening of these two horrible capacities of human beings.

His life is to be understood in a very, very deep sense.

But if you are like a journalist, you can say, “Why did He crucify Himself? If He was God, why did He get crucified?”. Now the question is ‘why He got crucified?’ is how to tell these journalists who don’t know anything about chakras. Because it was the era or the time of tapasya, of sacrifice and so then all these three persons, Buddha, Mahavira and Christ, went into complete renunciation.

They led a life of a great tapasvis. They did it for us, not for themselves.

They did not need it. They didn’t want it, but they had to do it to cleanse us, to give us a proper medha, as they call it, these Ekadasha Rudras, you see, to be cleared out.

And they have sacrificed their lives. They have sacrificed all the pleasures of life. For them, it was not a sacrifice. It is just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

For such people, there’s no question of sacrifice, but is a question of doing something that would help to open the chakras of the people in the future. Without them we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga. It was essential for these people to cleanse for us these three chakras, part of the one chakra of Christ.

All this they have worked out and that’s why today Sahaja Yoga is so beautifully created, so beautifully spreading, is working out. We have to thank them, very much.

Of course, all other incarnations also have helped, you can see – Vishuddhi, then also Heart, and all these, just (?) right Heart, left Heart.

All these angels (Shri Mataji laughs), as they are called in the Bible, have helped us to cross over.

All these incarnations are responsible in our evolutionary process to create these ladders for us to move.

So, ultimately, you reach the state of tapa on the sixth centre and then in the state of Truth, satya.

Then the Truth comes to you through Sahaja Yoga in the brain, in the limbic area, when the Kundalini enters, She puts light there.

She creates enlightened personalities and then She joins this All-pervading Power of Divine Love. And with this Divine Love, you are completely changed and transformed.

So their contribution to the ascent of human beings has been great and that of Christ has been the greatest.

And when we say we have to follow Christ, we should try to see how much detachment we have.

They say His brothers and sisters, or somebody, came to see Him. They say He had brothers. So He said, “Who are My brothers? These are My brothers. These are My relations.”

Gnyaneshwara has said the same thing, that “They will become your relations,” “Soyadikar, te chi soyadikar te”:”They will be your relations. They’ll be your brothers and sisters” And not those who are not enlightened. They are not your relations because they don’t understand you, they don’t have entry into the Kingdom of God, so they are not your relations.

In His lifetime He led a life of a person who was very simple. He didn’t bother about clothes or anything. All the conditionings of the worldly things were not Him. But He was not shameless type of a person who would accept any kind of a nudity and this and that.

Even about Mahavira there’s a big misconcept. He was once praying in a garden where there were lots of bushes, called as kunjas, and in the bush His cloth, which was only one cloth He was putting on, was caught up, so He cut half of it and was covering Himself.

Shri Krishna went to test Him and He said that, “I have nothing. I am just nude. So why don’t you give me your cloth because, after all, you are a king.” So He took out His cloth and gave it to Shri Krishna and got some leaves to cover Himself and He was in His own garden, and went into His own palace.

Now, if you see the Jains they make everything so horrible and insult Him all the time!

Most of the people who follow all these great incarnations really all the time insult them! They don’t follow, they insult! And, by their behaviour, you see, we form such a bad opinion of all these people.

I met one gentleman in Chicago in a very cold – it was very cold. He was the head of the hare-rama-hare-krishna. He was wearing a dhoti, which was so thin and was shaking before Me. I said, “What’s the matter?” He said, “I’m feeling very cold.” I said, “Why are you wearing this dhoti?” He said, “My guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.” I said, “Really? (Laughter) In India 80% people wear nothing but dhotis. Are they all going to go to heaven? And many must have gone already. (Laughter) So where will you be?” He didn’t like it. Then I said, “Why have you shaved your hair and put this -” We call it shendi or, in Hindi, coti, I don’t know what you call, pig’s tail here? Pig’s tail.

So he says, “It is because my guru told me that I must shave my head and have this kind of a thing.” So I think perhaps, maybe he will be tied to some rope and pulled in the heaven or something. (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). I said, “Kabira has said” – Kabira was one of them who has tried to slash out all your conditionings - “He said: by shaving your head if you are going to go to heaven, so what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year? He’ll be there earlier than you.” (Laughter) It’s a fact, it’s so, such stupid things.

Then there are Jain sadhus who will remain absolutely nude and will pull their hair. You know, by law they are allowed to go nude on the street, you know, insulting everyone.

All such stupid things are happening in the name of religion – that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira and Christ. They are the ones who are trying to pull us away from rationality because you have to cross this (Agnya).

All your limitations are because of this thinking, conditioning. We have to go beyond!

Because by thinking what do we do? We move in a linear way and then there’s no Truth in it, so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs, and you are finished.

We have go beyond this mind, must understand this point is. Christ has done this so that we can go beyond our mind.

If you don’t know how to go beyond mind, better sit down for your meditation, work it out.

With this mind, all kinds of things will come; temper will come, intrigue will come, jealousies will come. All the six enemies that we have will come to us through this mind – means thinking, rationality. Every kind – everything can be rationalised. “Why did you murder your wife?” “Because I hated her. She was this, she was that, she was that.” But you cannot murder her! “Why did you murder your husband?” “Because of this, because of that.” Because of this mind, we start doing things which are absolutely wrong, which are sinful, and then we try to rationalise it.

Go against Agnya, go against reality and then use your conditionings, use your, we can call, the ego to explain it, why you did it.

All the time when we are doing like that, we can never go beyond mind. We are so self-satisfied about ourselves. We think no end of ourselves. Now, how are we to get out of it? Introspection.

But it’s very difficult because people are afraid of themselves, they don’t want to introspect. Because, once they start introspecting, they will know how sinful they have been, how wrong things they have been doing and then they will hate themselves.

So they don’t want to introspect. But it’s very important that we should introspect.

That introspection is very helpful for you to overcome these two hurdles of your Agnya chakra.

I have told you many-a-times don’t argue with anybody because the other fellow, he is asking for argument, is the one has lots of ego and that ego is acting on you. So action-reaction starts, and we develop a habit of reacting to everything. Specially in the West, I have seen, they react to everything. Everything. For example now, this thing is spread out here.

Now they have nothing to do, “But they could have had better. Why is it so thin?”

Baba, you pay for it now. You do it!

They are walking across. They will say, “See, see this man, what sort of a person he is.” If there’s a beggar, then they’ll start criticising. They’ll criticise the government. They’ll criticise everyone. What about yourself? Instead of that, why don’t you start doing something about it? If you can’t help it, if you are not going to do anything about it, why react?

And this is the worst habit we have developed, is to react, and we think we have every right to react. You have, but this right is self-destructive.

To react on everything is not proper.

You have no authority to react.

It is to that extent. You have to just witness, witness the whole thing.

Once you start witnessing, you’ll be amazed that you will start seeing the play, play of the maya, as they call it, and you will see where you stand with it. Witnessing should be developed, all the time witness. “Am I witnessing?”

Many people say that I have very good memory - because I’m all the time witnessing. Everything is recorded within Me like a picture. And then when I have to say something, I have to correct something, all that I have witnessed comes to help Me.

First of all, we should not react, react to anything. Some people are attached, say, to money. They’ll react; they’ll not give any money. They’ll keep all the money with themselves. In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.

I’ve seen people who are very, very miserly about money. Another ones are who try to please others. Then they’ll waste their money on lavish things for nothing at all. There’s no need to waste.

Reaction can come through anything. Seeing something, you can react and you become so engrossed with it that you don’t realise that you are wasting all your brain energy on nonsensical things.

This reaction comes when you have lost complete sense of judgement. You don’t know what you are losing, what you are gaining by this kind of reaction.

And this reaction is going to destroy your inner being completely. Because all the time you are here and you are there and you are there and you are there. You are nowhere here.

If you are a very criticising type of a person, try to stop it completely. Criticise yourself.

Direct that energy towards yourself. “Who am I to criticise others? Who am I to react to anything?” Put a challenge to yourself and you will see that your ego will subside.

One day somebody came and told Me that, “Mother, I feel so angry. I feel like beating everyone.” I said, “Alright. Do one thing. Take a chappal (sandal) and hit on your head. Finished (laughter). That’s the only way you can (Shri Mataji laughs) get rid of this habit that you want to beat others.” He didn’t like it much, but I think, by that he’s improved.

Now, conditioning also should be seen. “Am I conditioned person? If my conditioning’s there, then is it a good conditioning or a bad condition?”

At least, you should have good conditioning. But even that, to an extreme if you go, you can create a problem for yourself and for others.

Most of these rituals and things started as a good conditioning, then it became like a trap and they could not get out of it. It’s a part and parcel of it one has to accept.

Then what should we do? We should not react. Just see the drama and you will be surprised, without paying anything, without going to any theatre, every moment you can see the drama going on before you, which is so enjoyable - whether it is absurd, whether it is ridiculous, whether it is a sort of a – as you see in the films, you see, beating somebody and all that – you just see it and you do not react. Anything that you think is very perverse, ugly, immoral, don’t see. Finished. Gone.

So don’t tax your mind because in the mind, that we call it, so-called mind, is actually the Agnya chakra in the centre of your optic chiasma.

Just imagine, what a central place it has. And any disturbance to your Agnya, what it can do to your brain which is nothing but a lump of fat.

So, how this Agnya can affect you and how it works and creates perverted images: that is to be really seen. Conditionings also, you have seen people are mentally so upset and so degenerated.

But the pure nature of Christ is Innocence, you know that. He is Shri Ganesha. Shri Ganesha is a eternal child. Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn’t react, because He is not conditioned. Children are not conditioned so much as we are. If you talk to children, if you speak to them, you’ll be amazed how innocent they are and how innocently they talk. Once my granddaughter asked Me, “What do you think of the poor children of the Tiger?” I said, “Why?” “You know, their father tells them that you eat human beings and what can they do? They have to eat human beings, after all.” You see, so innocent. (laughing). So I told her that they are under a complete control of God. Whatever they are doing, they are not going to be held responsible. It’s only for human beings that God has given this freedom. It’s only human beings who can react in this manner. So, for animals, it is, they are pashus, means they are completely under the control of the God Almighty. So they are swabhavas, everything, a serpent will be a serpent and a tiger will be a tiger and they will, say a lion will be a lion.

But human beings can be a serpent, at the same time could be a scorpion, could be a lion, could be anything.

You know, suddenly, you find a small, little, bug-like man coming up like a lion roaring at you and you say, “From where does this come, this cannon?” It is so.

You don’t know which way they will come and which way the camel will sit. You can’t say.

So this reaction of human beings comes because he is not in connection with the Divine. When he is in the connection with the Divine, he sees the drama and he leaves everything to Divine. He can solve all his problem by just one bandhan (Hindi words aside). He can solve all the problems just by a bandhan (Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers).

But he should be in full connection with the Divine.

It works. It works. It does work. This is not the time when Christ came on this Earth.

This is the time when this Paramachaitanya has gone into action – activated, is working out everything.

Now they asked Me about these Shri Ganesha [statues] (Ganesh statues ‘drank’ milk on 21 September 1995 all over India), whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not. I said, “Anything possible.” These days this Paramachaitanya is doing such things, unbelievable things, which we cannot understand. Everything is a chamatkar (miracle), so it’s possible.

Ganeshas, I have never heard of Ganesha liking milk so much, but maybe for the little rat He might be drinking. (Laughter)

You can’t say. “But why did Shiva drink?” I said, “Let it be. Let Shiva wants to drink, let Him have milk.” Actually, we have too much milk production so they must be wanting to consume some. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)

But it’s just a way [of] looking at things that, you see, when everything is done by this Paramchaitanya. They are doing such wonderful things. I mean, I never asked them to do anything.

But now, for example, in Brisbane when I was there, I was sleeping in the ashram and the rainbow appeared. Of course, I like paintings very much of Raphael specially, because he has drawn the Mother’s face and the Child’s face so exactly expressing the feeling of Mother and the child.

And imagine that picture appears in the sky. But I didn’t tell them to show that Raphael.

When I was sleeping I was not even going to look at it.

But at this time the halo that was on the backside of Mary comes upon the head.

Means Raphael himself did it, or – I don’t know.

How can I explain this? Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things; and it does all these just to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.

Because even now there are many who are supposed to be very rational, intelligent, educated who don’t want to accept it.

After all, if there is a Divine Power, if there is something like that and is active, how can you challenge it? How can you say no to it?

Because the powers are unlimited, it has gone into every atom and every molecule. It doesn’t do tricks like moving this from there to there (like some false gurus - ed), but what it does is to do something which is absolutely impossible. It is doing it.

So, for us to believe in this activated Paramchaitanya is the only solution, so you leave it in the Ocean of Bliss and let this great power handle all the situations – don’t react yourself – which is so efficient, so quick, so fast, moves all over, understands everything and it loves you and respects you because you are sahaja yogis. This is what it is today.

We should know, at the time when we are celebrating Christmas, that what we are celebrating is really our own ascent, our own achievements, our own lofty heights which we have achieved and which we have to achieve.

We should have only aspirations as far as our spiritual side is concerned. All aspirations should be left to this Paramchaitanya, “You look after them.” And the more you become, the more you develop this non-reacting attitude through your proper Agnya - not anger, not silence, but a very pleasant temperament.

That means people think that I have told you not to speak. No, no, you must speak. You must talk to people, you must laugh, you must enjoy, but all this should be full of joyous feelings.

That’s what they say that Christmas is for, a very joyous atmosphere. So they can’t do that way, so they drink. I mean, after all, you must give them benefit of doubt also, that why do they drink. They think by drinking they will become joyous.

Now our understanding about ourselves has to be very clear-cut. Specially people don’t meditate. They just don’t meditate. They don’t want to grow. They are sahaja yogis, but they don’t meditate. It’s very surprising. I can make out who meditates, who does not. Because there is no depth. They want to have this, they want to have that, is alright, but what about meditation? If you don’t meditate, your Agnya will be completely covered with thoughts and you will be lost.

So, you have to meditate. If you don’t meditate, I also suffer. If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga, it’s better to leave, because you are like seeds which are sprouted and which will be wasted.

Some people are here because they want some sort of a platform, some publicity. Some are here who want money, to make money out of Sahaja Yoga. There are some who want to have a kind of a communication to go around the whole world without paying a single pai. All such people are of no use to themselves.

Now here you have the complete wealth. All that celestial wealth is before you and you are not going to accept it. You are not going to drown into it. What should we say? This is not very sensible to do.

As I said, you don’t have to crucify yourself. You don’t have to give up anything. You don’t have to live like Christ had to live or be born in the manger. All that’s done for you already. Now, come along.

But if you are coming in the darbar (royal court) of the Divine, then be worth it. You should be worth it and you’ll be surprised, all your problems will be solved, your self-respect will be maintained.

So many things have happened like that, but if you have no self-respect, you don’t respect your realisation, you are not deeply involved as to your own ascent and the help to others, it will not work out.

I’m here to tell you all these things which Christ could not tell and to fulfil what He wanted to say. All those things I am saying to you - it has already worked, you all have got realisation. But develop respect for yourself, as Sahaja Yogis. Don’t have funny ideas about yourself; just know you are a Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogini. That’s what is needed for a person if he is today celebrating the birth of Christ. He came on this Earth, who was actually Christ full of innocence who was the One who came as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha. I have given the proof of it to you how the carbon atom looks like and by which I have proved that Christ is the Alpha and Omega, while He is made out of Omkara and Swastika.

All this we have experimented. We have found it. It’s there. With all this, what is the greatest achievement is to respect your innocence. Respect your innocence.

This is what is to be asked for today. Be innocent. And God looks after all the innocent people.

Don’t worry, you don’t have to worry.

I have seen children falling for seven storeys, nothing happens to them.

They are perfectly alright. How? Who looks after?

Angels. You have seen photographs of angels around you. So try to be simple, innocent, not reactive and keep quiet and peaceful, because here we are talking about a global transformation where people will find their peace in their heart and will establish a new world of peace, joy and spirituality.

May God bless you all.
