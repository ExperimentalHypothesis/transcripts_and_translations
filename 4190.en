b'Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule (India), 25 December 1995.\n\nHappy Christmas to all of you.\n\nIt is a great day when Christ came on this Earth and you know about how He was specially created to come down as a human being to work out the salvation of the people.\n\nIt is said that He came to India, in Kashmir, and He met there the King Shalivahana. It\xe2\x80\x99s all in Sanskrit, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the conversation took place between Christ and King Shalivahana who was a great devotee of the Mother.\n\nThen he asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d In Sanskrit it\xe2\x80\x99s all written. So He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI come from a country where people believe in filth and I think this is My own country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo Shalivahana said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are such a great person who has come on this Earth, so you should go back to those countries to save them and to tell them about the pure principle of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn Sanskrit it was written \xe2\x80\x9cNirmala Tattwam\xe2\x80\x9d (pure principle). And Christ went back and after three and a half years only, He was crucified. These were special days. I call them the days of tapasya. Same time Buddha and Mahavira were born at the same level of the Virata\xe2\x80\x99s forehead.\n\nAs you know that, according to Vedas, there are seven awarenesses we can go through or the subtle qualities we have within ourselves.\n\nThe first one was the bhuh. Bhuh is Ganesha was created.\n\nSecond is bhurvah, meaning \xe2\x80\x98antariksha\xe2\x80\x99, means all that is created around us.\n\nThe third one is swaha at Nabhi Chakra.\n\nSwaha is the one where you consume everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s - in modern times, you see, people go on consuming everything. All kinds of books they will read, they\xe2\x80\x99ll go to all kinds of things and if you tell them, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d [They say] \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you dress up like this?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis just consumption of everything goes on.\n\nBut then, at that time, also there is another great thing within us, it\xe2\x80\x99s called as swadha, where we sustain the dharma within us \xe2\x80\x93 swadha. Dharma of everything.\n\nSee, those people who say there should be no blind faith and this and that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not blind, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an inner urge.\n\nWhy we love our parents? Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a dharma within us. Why do we live - believe in our country? Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a dharma within us. All these dharmas is there. Why a wife loves her husband? Because there is dharma. Why the husband loves the wife? Because there is dharma. When this dharma is within you. We don\xe2\x80\x99t call it religion because it can mean something else.\n\nThis one is sustaining, dharayati. Once it is sustained within ourselves, it becomes swadha.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s our capacity, that\xe2\x80\x99s our quality. We can call it an innate understanding.\n\nSome of them are even in the animals, like attachment to parents, attachment to their masters.\n\nThen comes the higher awareness where your mana. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s not mind, because very confusion, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big confusion with \xe2\x80\x9cmind,\xe2\x80\x9d you see. English language is really quite confusing.\n\nMana means \xe2\x80\x9cby which we have emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, recently I read that they are now talking about, not only of IQ, but EQ, means emotional coefficients. That means a person who has only intelligence is not alright. He must also have the balance of emotions. They are coming to it now, but first they only used to only praise people who have IQ. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the situation. So now, it is different, perhaps they are realising that through intelligence how people have created chaos, violence, all kinds of destruction on this Earth. So now they are talking about a higher capacity within us called as EQ, which capacity is emotional.\n\nThis emotional capacity comes to you as an inner urge, as an inner capability, which you cannot avoid.\n\nA person may be anything in life, but if he has no love, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any emotional feelings, then he is not complete.\n\nNow these emotional things also could be very limited, no doubt. They could be something that gets attached to somebody, or something can happen; as also the IQ, where we get attached to some idea.\n\nLike Hitler had some idea and he believed that it was the truth and he has to do it.\n\nSo when you get attached to one idea like that, you can just do things, which are not at all helpful, supportive or nourishing to Reality.\n\nAll these things have happened: wars, destruction, also, as you see nowadays, the people are trying to secretly destroy others.\n\nAll these are coming as the anti-feeling, where the mana has developed a domination of the intelligence, where emotions are dominated by intelligence and rationality.\n\nSo there is another awareness within us, another capability within us, another urge within us, innately built is the jana. Jana means the people, the communication.\n\nYou cannot live alone. You see, a man who goes to jail, he is quite happy, he is quite comfortable, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do any work. Everything is done for him. If he has a good class, he lives very well, much better than he would live outside. But the only thing is he cannot meet other people. He cannot communicate.\n\nAnd when this capacity of communication \xe2\x80\x93 which is within us, I mean, which is a part and parcel of human existence \xe2\x80\x93 is taken away, a person in the jail feels absolutely frustrated and unhappy. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind labouring, doing all kinds of menial work as long as he is not in the jail, cut out of the communications with others.\n\nSo this communication is also an inner urge within us. (Indistinct word: \xe2\x80\x9cGood\xe2\x80\x9d?) In that also, people sometimes go too far and neglect other dharmas. They are more bothered about communication than about other dharmas, which are very important. So there is no balance in a person.\n\nThen comes the sixth awareness within us, which is a very interesting thing. One was where we take to conditionings. Say, if I\xe2\x80\x99m an Indian, then I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of Indians. I can never see anything wrong with them or I may see everything wrong with them.\n\nIt can be both ways.\n\nHow you have been conditioned is the point, and this conditioning comes to us through our sixth centre of Agnya.\n\nAnd the another thing that we develop when somebody tries to condition us or to control us, we try to get out of it or sometimes we try to dominate. This dominating capacity is also within us, innately built.\n\nBoth things are innately built within us that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.\n\nFor example, I would say that in a very stupid, silly manner (Shri Mataji laughs) people get conditioned. Is impossible to get them out of it. It always comes out of self-centredness that a person has no value for understanding. Like, now, somebody comes to your house, he is a vegetarian. Alright, now he stays with you.\n\nSo: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a vegetarian. You must get new utensils to cook the food because I can\xe2\x80\x99t have food in the utensils where the meat is cooked!\xe2\x80\x9d Alright.\n\nThen \xe2\x80\x9cYou must get your servant in a proper manner, so send him to some place where you can get the well water\xe2\x80\x9d. The servant must be absolutely drenched \xe2\x80\x93 this is typical Indian old style \xe2\x80\x93 and should go and draw the water from the well and bring it for drinking and cooking, while the servant dies of pneumonia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. All such stupid conditionings we have.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not only that in the East you find all these conditionings. The West is even worse. For example, they have clubbing. Now there are clubs where people wear particular type of clothes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a club. Now if they wear something else, then everybody will laugh at them.\n\nOr how to use the spoon and fork is very important in the West.\n\nHow they use spoon and fork \xe2\x80\x93 specially English have this nonsensical conditioning. If somebody uses the fork and spoon in a wrong way, then finished. He is nowhere. He is not sophisticated.\n\nThe ideas of sophistication and all that comes through conditionings of ages because maybe they were primitive to begin with. They had no clothes, proper clothes to wear. Might be they were covering themselves with some leaves or something, I mean, only hundreds of years back.\n\nSo now, they have jumped to the other side, very particular about their dress, very particular about fork and spoon. And they just can\xe2\x80\x99t bear something that is different. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that\xe2\x80\x9d is very common there. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, they came to India, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t like!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you don\xe2\x80\x99t like?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way Indians dress up!\xe2\x80\x9d Alright, you dress up the way you like. Let Indians dress up the way they like.\n\nNow why do you think that your dress in England will suit here in India, which is such a hot, hot, hot country?\xe2\x80\x9d But: \xe2\x80\x9cNo! This is how we are.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s quite funny the way they have [conditionings \xe2\x80\x93 ed.]. And this conditioning goes on into such a deep manner that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.\n\nFor example, if the queen has invited you, you must wear a tailcoat. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s very expensive to have a tailcoat. You know, they have to go to a particular shop to borrow it. Sometimes they are loose and sometimes they are tight. I have seen people coming to these parties, Queen\xe2\x80\x99s parties, I could never recognise them because somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin or somebody looked like Laurel or somebody like Hardy (laughter). I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out who are these people.\n\nThen I was told he is \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s such-and-such ambassador\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cOh my God, I know him very well. What has happened to him?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThey cannot walk straight. Their gait changes because of the clothes, which are so tight sometimes and sometimes so loose. But \xe2\x80\x93 you have to wear. All these formal ideas come to us as a kind of a part and parcel of you because you accept all these conditionings.\n\nSo the other side it goes to that \xe2\x80\x9cWe abandon all this. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want all this\xe2\x80\x9d, the anti-culture. So I met one gentleman who was wearing a pant, which had lots of holes in it. Imagine in the cold of London to wear a pant like that! So I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to wear a pant which has holes?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a holey pant.\xe2\x80\x9d Holey?!\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness. It will give you varicose veins. It\xe2\x80\x99s horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? We are anti-culture people, so we are taking now to holey pants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI mean such stupid people are, not only who are uneducated, but very well-educated people, highly-placed people are so conditioned, and this conditioning has caused so much damage to human beings.\n\nFor example, to accept Freud had become just a complete religion in the West. Freud became Christ at that level, though he was a Jew, and he dominated the Western culture so much that I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the impact of this stupid man who would have been thrown in the sea if he had come to India.\n\nBut the conditioning part is everything is written is law. And they accepted this man so much that the culture of the West became absolutely self-destructive throughout.\n\nNo respect, no morality, nothing was lofty, all value system shattered, because they accepted this kind of nonsense because it was written.\n\nEven today, I hear \xe2\x80\x9cin such-and-such book such is written; in that book such-and-such thing is written.\xe2\x80\x9d This is terrible conditioning. For example, it\xe2\x80\x99s written in the Bible that Jews crucified Christ. Nonsense! Just use your brains!\n\nHow can Jews crucify Christ? They were in a multitude. In any country have you heard that a person can be crucified with the general opinion of the people?\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the government, the Roman government did that. But to put the blame on the Jews was a very good idea of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul and people accepted that because it suited them to hate the Jews.\n\nThen the Jews started creating people like Freud.\n\nSo all such conditionings also have reactions, and these conditionings then build up and once they build up, their reactions also build up, and you have a country full of all kinds of chaos, fear, violence and destruction.\n\nThe conditioning is more, also, with the idea of possession. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my land. This possession is mine, that is this, that.\xe2\x80\x9d Like this it goes up to a point where people who believed in the formless God also fight for the land. Why should they? They believe in the formless God, so why should they fight for the land?\n\nBut they\xe2\x80\x99ll go on fighting for the land, and this fighting for the land can go to any extent of very cruel things that whole country can work out.\n\nConditionings are of every kind, if you see are blinding your eyes.\n\nFor example, they believe in Koran.\n\nSimple thing is, Koran was never written by Mohammed Sahib. He never knew how to read and write. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. For 40 years it was not written. There was a fellow called Muawiyah, or something like that, who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons. He was the second kalipha. The first one died very early.\n\nThen he killed the third one also. Then he killed the fourth one, just to become himself the kalipha. And the liver of this fourth kalipha was eaten by the mother of this horrible fellow, who hated women. So he puts it down in the Koran, all the things against women, and people accept it because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the Koran!\n\nSomebody has made fun of Koran and written what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong and it\xe2\x80\x99s all stupidities and all that. So I asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of writing this book. What is the use?\xe2\x80\x9d He said: \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of the use\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you write? It must have some use. It\xe2\x80\x99s a useless book.\xe2\x80\x9d - I said - \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only useful that by reading this all the people who are Muslims will \xe2\x80\x93 (Shri Mataji corrects Herself) who are not Muslims will laugh at Islam, and those who are Muslims will say, \xe2\x80\x98Wa! Well, this is our book. Whatever it says, we believe in it. We are conditioned like that.\xe2\x80\x99 So, you don\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d So he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen what should I do?\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou write another book saying that, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all stupidity I\xe2\x80\x99ve written of Koran because I know it was not written by Mohammed Sahib\xe2\x80\x99. Don\xe2\x80\x99t write anything of Mohammed Sahib, against him. He is the One who is the incarnation of Dattatreya. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. So you write that he never wrote it, so all these people have done all these things\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThis conditioning can be removed if you know what sort of life Christ led, very important.\n\nFirst of all, He was born in a manger.\n\nTo be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance.\n\nThat means He showed there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to have money or there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to have a huge, big properties or anything to be impressive on people. Those were the days where people respected the tapasvis, the ones who were doing tapasya. That was the time to do tapasya.\n\nSo He came on this Earth and lived like a tapasvi. On the contrary, the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you could think of. You go to any Christian nation you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed how they are just slaves of money and their watches.\n\nHow they are living, it\xe2\x80\x99s very shocking to see they are \xe2\x80\x98following\xe2\x80\x99 Christ. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we follow Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d Then follow means what? He is there and you are standing backwards moving. Is that the following?\n\nIf you see the Catholic Church or even Protestants you\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked. How are they following Christ I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\n\nUntil now, I never understood. Because Catholic is nothing but money-oriented. The only thing they have picked up from Christ that He went to a wedding and created wine out of water and distributed.\n\nNow this wine is just the juice of the grapes.\n\nIs also called wine in the Hebrew language.\n\nThank God, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read Bible in Hebrew translated directly. So it\xe2\x80\x99s called draksharas (\xe2\x80\x98grape juice\xe2\x80\x99 in Sanskrit) because instantly you cannot create alcohol. It has to rot, rot, rot and the more it rots the more good it is, they say. They write it down, this is 25 years old, so is the price is much. But if it is three hundred year old, the price is exorbitant.\n\nSo it has to rot and smell like hell, then only it\xe2\x80\x99s a good alcohol \xe2\x80\x93 is a fact. How could Christ create that instant, that moment, alcohol?\n\nBut now, what I find is this, that if somebody dies, they will take champagne - to celebrate what? Good riddance of bad rubbish? (Laughter)\n\nOr when somebody is born, they will do it, but on Christmas Day especially, after coming from church don\xe2\x80\x99t go to any Christian\xe2\x80\x99s house!\n\nEven the Indian Christians have started following the Western people because Indian Christians believe that Christ was born in England! (Laughter)\n\nAll such ideas have come from where? Is because the English and the Portuguese and the French brought Christianity to us. Now, by any chance, are they Christians? What business they had to bring Christianity to this place? They took Christianity to all the places, specially Spanish.\n\nSpanish, Portuguese went round the whole world to spread Christianity and today is the mess that you see in those people. They are nothing but drunkards.\n\nYesterday I was going back and the sea was full of happiness and joy and the water had reached a very high level. It happens with Me. But what I found, there were four, five Christians coming, singing carols and just completely drunk and I was thinking they\xe2\x80\x99ll be drowned in this water very soon.\n\nThis was the great boon of Christianity on human beings that you can drink as much as you like.\n\nNow, this drinking has come, I should say, from where, God alone knows, but it has come also from the Christians. And the Muslims also drink, no doubt, but they hide and drink, they don\xe2\x80\x99t openly drink and don\xe2\x80\x99t call it\xe2\x80\x99s a religious duty that you should drink. Imagine, in the church when they give communication, they give you some sort of a dirty smelling wine. After that how can you have communication? Once you are drunk, you are finished! (Laughter) But all these things happen.\n\nSo, today we are talking about Christ. He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra controlling pineal and pituitary.\n\nBy that, He controls our conditionings.\n\nIf we follow Him, then we cannot be conditioned by anything, because He talked of Spirit only. Spirit cannot be conditioned, conditioned by anything. Whatever is good, that will be accepted, good, congenial to the Spirit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different attitude of a person who is spiritual.\n\nLike we had people here, I know they are not very comfortable. Some of them are put into these tents here and there, but they are enjoying because they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care where they sleep, where they live, what they have. This is all because you have entered into the kingdom of God.\n\nBut those who have not, so much worried [complain], \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not good. I want this way, that way.\xe2\x80\x9d All material happiness they seek, trouble everybody, criticise everybody, get angry with everybody. But actually they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got spiritual joy. And they can never be really in joy unless and until they become fully spiritual.\n\nChrist has openly said that \xe2\x80\x93 you have to know yourself. Same in Koran.\n\nMohammed Sahib has said, \xe2\x80\x9cUnless and until you know yourself, you will not know God.\xe2\x80\x9d There are lots of truths in Koran I find left over by this Muawiya and also in the Bible.\n\nAlso in the Jews, I find their Torah and all that has lots of Truth, but is covered by all this kind of thinking, rationality and adjustments they have done for their own use.\n\nActually, we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion. Never! None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham, He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about Moses, He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about Christ and His Mother much more than in the Bible. Respected Her! And he said there have been more than one lakh (100,000) walis, means realised souls before. But still Muslims are some sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d people because they call themselves Muslims. Whether they drink, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, whether they womanise doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, they kill people doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. They are running after few things, which are forbidden to them, but still they are Muslims. Same with the Christians. Difficult to find a man who is a real Christian, who follows Christ, before realisation. After realisation, of course, you are different, but for that you have to cross this Agnya.\n\nAgnya also is there which has to control your ego. Christ, in His lifetime showed how ego works. His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ, such a great incarnation of purity, was crucified, shows what people are like, what they did to Him, how He was troubled and tortured by these stupid people and then how He was crucified by the government there.\n\nIn the beginning there were many sahaja yogis, I should say they were called as gnostics \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cgn\xe2\x80\x9d in Sanskrit means knowledge \xe2\x80\x93 who had the knowledge about Self. Christ has said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 He said that \xe2\x80\x9cKnow thy-self.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to knock at the door\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 meaning you must have shuddha iccha, otherwise it won\xe2\x80\x99t work out. Nobody can force you.\n\nHe controls the ego. He is the one who gives you the balance. But, if you go to the West, you know they are nothing but some sort of a stupid, donkey-like ego! The way they talk, the way they behave towards each other, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big eye-opener. They are developed. How are they developed, God knows. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they are very advanced, sophisticated, this, that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith this Agnya catching, Christ has said in His Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer, \xe2\x80\x9cForgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat a big thing to say. But one thing I have seen in the West, people don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to forgive. They are full of hatred. And they cannot ask forgiveness because they are full of terrible ego. Though they will feel guilty, but they will never ask for forgiveness. They\xe2\x80\x99ll never say that, \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, forgive me for what I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d This is so common now.\n\nFor example, the Nazis, they killed so many people and still you find this neo-Nazis coming up, even in Italy! They are not ashamed as to what they have done.\n\nThis happens because there is no, really, connection with Christ. Firstly, if you have connection with Christ, your ego has to be finished. Absolutely.\n\nAnd this ego, which comes to you from various sources, is a myth. It\xe2\x80\x99s a myth. With this ego, people try to befool others and show off.\n\nLike there\xe2\x80\x99s a story of Shahpesh (\xe2\x80\x98The Punishment of Khilpil\xe2\x80\x99 by George Meredith). I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you have read about him. He (Khilpil) came to a King (Shahpesh) and told him that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a great architect and I\xe2\x80\x99ll build a big palace for you, and this and that.\xe2\x80\x9d The way he posed, the king believed him. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright. Go ahead. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you so much money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, with this whole attitude and the way he was describing himself, with all his gestures, full of such ego, that this king also got completely lost. He gave him lots of money. And in six months\xe2\x80\x99 time he came back, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have built your palace. Come and have a look.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went there, he saw it was just the same land. There was no palace, nothing. So king thought \xe2\x80\x9cSomething gone wrong with him or what?\xe2\x80\x9d. He was again looking and looking, and what does he find? He finds there was no palace, nothing. Immediately he realised that this ego has befooled him.\n\nSo, the king was very clever that way. He realised it. So he started saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, this is the main road by which we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and there\xe2\x80\x99s the palace. Now the door opens.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing there. It\xe2\x80\x99s all just a story. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now here is your throne and please be seated on that.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cFirst you sit.\xe2\x80\x9d He made this Shahpesh (Khilpil) to sit on a throne which never existed.\n\nNow imagine, it was very painful. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou sit, I want to see you sitting there. I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d For one hour he made him sit. For two hours he made him sit.\n\nUltimately, Shahpesh (Khilpil) fell at his feet and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. There is no palace. There is no throne. Nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the king had lost all his money and so he imprisoned him. He was beaten up and did all kinds of things.\n\nSo this is the end of false ideas about oneself. This ego can take you to such a heights of stupidity. And the culture where it is pampered, is the worst culture.\n\nI have seen advertisements where they say \xe2\x80\x9cyou must smoke this particular cigarette because it expresses your ego.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut according to Indian culture to express your ego is absolutely something very stupid, people laugh at such a person, the one who tries to show his ego. In Marathi language if somebody is trying to show off, then they say he is climbing on a small little shrub of chana (chick peas).\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the whole system is such, so nobody can develop any ego. If they develop, then they are corrected. Specially in Maharashtra, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to develop any ego. As soon as you start talking big about yourself, immediately you are punctured.\n\nBut in the North, of course, is little bit allowed, I think, and people do talk big. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are great politicians who talk very big. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do this. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do that. We are going to have this project, that project, this, that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne thing, Christ never said such a thing. Never He talked [like that].\n\nWhat - if you see His sermons, it\xe2\x80\x99s so deep and so enlightening, despite the effort of this gentleman, Mr. Paul, you see Christ talking to people, giving them different ways of explanation - what happens after realisation, how a seed is sprouted and how it can get spoiled - and very beautifully He explained to people. But I think had, didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much effect at that time.\n\nHis life was so charming and so beautiful. Like a shooting star He came on this Earth, but He left such a remarkable impression on people.\n\nHis crucifixion was a part of the game because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra. To cross the Agnya Chakra He was crucified. But His message is not crucifixion. People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it.\n\nHe crucified Himself, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the message, that\xe2\x80\x99s not [what] you should celebrate, that He crucified. There are people who celebrate it! You have to celebrate His resurrection, the Resurrection because human beings are to be resurrected.\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ. That was enough! That was sufficient. You can\xe2\x80\x99t carry the cross on your shoulders, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. He has carried for you. He has done everything for you. Is said also that He died for all the sinners \xe2\x80\x93 is a fact.\n\nIf He had not done that, it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas because two problems, I told you: is conditionings and ego. His crucifixion has helped the loosening of these two horrible capacities of human beings.\n\nHis life is to be understood in a very, very deep sense.\n\nBut if you are like a journalist, you can say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did He crucify Himself? If He was God, why did He get crucified?\xe2\x80\x9d. Now the question is \xe2\x80\x98why He got crucified?\xe2\x80\x99 is how to tell these journalists who don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about chakras. Because it was the era or the time of tapasya, of sacrifice and so then all these three persons, Buddha, Mahavira and Christ, went into complete renunciation.\n\nThey led a life of a great tapasvis. They did it for us, not for themselves.\n\nThey did not need it. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, but they had to do it to cleanse us, to give us a proper medha, as they call it, these Ekadasha Rudras, you see, to be cleared out.\n\nAnd they have sacrificed their lives. They have sacrificed all the pleasures of life. For them, it was not a sacrifice. It is just a kind of a life they wanted to have.\n\nFor such people, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question of sacrifice, but is a question of doing something that would help to open the chakras of the people in the future. Without them we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga. It was essential for these people to cleanse for us these three chakras, part of the one chakra of Christ.\n\nAll this they have worked out and that\xe2\x80\x99s why today Sahaja Yoga is so beautifully created, so beautifully spreading, is working out. We have to thank them, very much.\n\nOf course, all other incarnations also have helped, you can see \xe2\x80\x93 Vishuddhi, then also Heart, and all these, just (?) right Heart, left Heart.\n\nAll these angels (Shri Mataji laughs), as they are called in the Bible, have helped us to cross over.\n\nAll these incarnations are responsible in our evolutionary process to create these ladders for us to move.\n\nSo, ultimately, you reach the state of tapa on the sixth centre and then in the state of Truth, satya.\n\nThen the Truth comes to you through Sahaja Yoga in the brain, in the limbic area, when the Kundalini enters, She puts light there.\n\nShe creates enlightened personalities and then She joins this All-pervading Power of Divine Love. And with this Divine Love, you are completely changed and transformed.\n\nSo their contribution to the ascent of human beings has been great and that of Christ has been the greatest.\n\nAnd when we say we have to follow Christ, we should try to see how much detachment we have.\n\nThey say His brothers and sisters, or somebody, came to see Him. They say He had brothers. So He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho are My brothers? These are My brothers. These are My relations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGnyaneshwara has said the same thing, that \xe2\x80\x9cThey will become your relations,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSoyadikar, te chi soyadikar te\xe2\x80\x9d:\xe2\x80\x9dThey will be your relations. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be your brothers and sisters\xe2\x80\x9d And not those who are not enlightened. They are not your relations because they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have entry into the Kingdom of God, so they are not your relations.\n\nIn His lifetime He led a life of a person who was very simple. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother about clothes or anything. All the conditionings of the worldly things were not Him. But He was not shameless type of a person who would accept any kind of a nudity and this and that.\n\nEven about Mahavira there\xe2\x80\x99s a big misconcept. He was once praying in a garden where there were lots of bushes, called as kunjas, and in the bush His cloth, which was only one cloth He was putting on, was caught up, so He cut half of it and was covering Himself.\n\nShri Krishna went to test Him and He said that, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing. I am just nude. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give me your cloth because, after all, you are a king.\xe2\x80\x9d So He took out His cloth and gave it to Shri Krishna and got some leaves to cover Himself and He was in His own garden, and went into His own palace.\n\nNow, if you see the Jains they make everything so horrible and insult Him all the time!\n\nMost of the people who follow all these great incarnations really all the time insult them! They don\xe2\x80\x99t follow, they insult! And, by their behaviour, you see, we form such a bad opinion of all these people.\n\nI met one gentleman in Chicago in a very cold \xe2\x80\x93 it was very cold. He was the head of the hare-rama-hare-krishna. He was wearing a dhoti, which was so thin and was shaking before Me. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m feeling very cold.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you wearing this dhoti?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cReally? (Laughter) In India 80% people wear nothing but dhotis. Are they all going to go to heaven? And many must have gone already. (Laughter) So where will you be?\xe2\x80\x9d He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you shaved your hair and put this -\xe2\x80\x9d We call it shendi or, in Hindi, coti, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you call, pig\xe2\x80\x99s tail here? Pig\xe2\x80\x99s tail.\n\nSo he says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because my guru told me that I must shave my head and have this kind of a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d So I think perhaps, maybe he will be tied to some rope and pulled in the heaven or something. (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). I said, \xe2\x80\x9cKabira has said\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kabira was one of them who has tried to slash out all your conditionings - \xe2\x80\x9cHe said: by shaving your head if you are going to go to heaven, so what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year? He\xe2\x80\x99ll be there earlier than you.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter) It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s so, such stupid things.\n\nThen there are Jain sadhus who will remain absolutely nude and will pull their hair. You know, by law they are allowed to go nude on the street, you know, insulting everyone.\n\nAll such stupid things are happening in the name of religion \xe2\x80\x93 that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira and Christ. They are the ones who are trying to pull us away from rationality because you have to cross this (Agnya).\n\nAll your limitations are because of this thinking, conditioning. We have to go beyond!\n\nBecause by thinking what do we do? We move in a linear way and then there\xe2\x80\x99s no Truth in it, so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs, and you are finished.\n\nWe have go beyond this mind, must understand this point is. Christ has done this so that we can go beyond our mind.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to go beyond mind, better sit down for your meditation, work it out.\n\nWith this mind, all kinds of things will come; temper will come, intrigue will come, jealousies will come. All the six enemies that we have will come to us through this mind \xe2\x80\x93 means thinking, rationality. Every kind \xe2\x80\x93 everything can be rationalised. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you murder your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I hated her. She was this, she was that, she was that.\xe2\x80\x9d But you cannot murder her! \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you murder your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of this, because of that.\xe2\x80\x9d Because of this mind, we start doing things which are absolutely wrong, which are sinful, and then we try to rationalise it.\n\nGo against Agnya, go against reality and then use your conditionings, use your, we can call, the ego to explain it, why you did it.\n\nAll the time when we are doing like that, we can never go beyond mind. We are so self-satisfied about ourselves. We think no end of ourselves. Now, how are we to get out of it? Introspection.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult because people are afraid of themselves, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to introspect. Because, once they start introspecting, they will know how sinful they have been, how wrong things they have been doing and then they will hate themselves.\n\nSo they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to introspect. But it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that we should introspect.\n\nThat introspection is very helpful for you to overcome these two hurdles of your Agnya chakra.\n\nI have told you many-a-times don\xe2\x80\x99t argue with anybody because the other fellow, he is asking for argument, is the one has lots of ego and that ego is acting on you. So action-reaction starts, and we develop a habit of reacting to everything. Specially in the West, I have seen, they react to everything. Everything. For example now, this thing is spread out here.\n\nNow they have nothing to do, \xe2\x80\x9cBut they could have had better. Why is it so thin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBaba, you pay for it now. You do it!\n\nThey are walking across. They will say, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, see this man, what sort of a person he is.\xe2\x80\x9d If there\xe2\x80\x99s a beggar, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll start criticising. They\xe2\x80\x99ll criticise the government. They\xe2\x80\x99ll criticise everyone. What about yourself? Instead of that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you start doing something about it? If you can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, if you are not going to do anything about it, why react?\n\nAnd this is the worst habit we have developed, is to react, and we think we have every right to react. You have, but this right is self-destructive.\n\nTo react on everything is not proper.\n\nYou have no authority to react.\n\nIt is to that extent. You have to just witness, witness the whole thing.\n\nOnce you start witnessing, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed that you will start seeing the play, play of the maya, as they call it, and you will see where you stand with it. Witnessing should be developed, all the time witness. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I witnessing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMany people say that I have very good memory - because I\xe2\x80\x99m all the time witnessing. Everything is recorded within Me like a picture. And then when I have to say something, I have to correct something, all that I have witnessed comes to help Me.\n\nFirst of all, we should not react, react to anything. Some people are attached, say, to money. They\xe2\x80\x99ll react; they\xe2\x80\x99ll not give any money. They\xe2\x80\x99ll keep all the money with themselves. In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people who are very, very miserly about money. Another ones are who try to please others. Then they\xe2\x80\x99ll waste their money on lavish things for nothing at all. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to waste.\n\nReaction can come through anything. Seeing something, you can react and you become so engrossed with it that you don\xe2\x80\x99t realise that you are wasting all your brain energy on nonsensical things.\n\nThis reaction comes when you have lost complete sense of judgement. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are losing, what you are gaining by this kind of reaction.\n\nAnd this reaction is going to destroy your inner being completely. Because all the time you are here and you are there and you are there and you are there. You are nowhere here.\n\nIf you are a very criticising type of a person, try to stop it completely. Criticise yourself.\n\nDirect that energy towards yourself. \xe2\x80\x9cWho am I to criticise others? Who am I to react to anything?\xe2\x80\x9d Put a challenge to yourself and you will see that your ego will subside.\n\nOne day somebody came and told Me that, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I feel so angry. I feel like beating everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlright. Do one thing. Take a chappal (sandal) and hit on your head. Finished (laughter). That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way you can (Shri Mataji laughs) get rid of this habit that you want to beat others.\xe2\x80\x9d He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it much, but I think, by that he\xe2\x80\x99s improved.\n\nNow, conditioning also should be seen. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I conditioned person? If my conditioning\xe2\x80\x99s there, then is it a good conditioning or a bad condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt least, you should have good conditioning. But even that, to an extreme if you go, you can create a problem for yourself and for others.\n\nMost of these rituals and things started as a good conditioning, then it became like a trap and they could not get out of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a part and parcel of it one has to accept.\n\nThen what should we do? We should not react. Just see the drama and you will be surprised, without paying anything, without going to any theatre, every moment you can see the drama going on before you, which is so enjoyable - whether it is absurd, whether it is ridiculous, whether it is a sort of a \xe2\x80\x93 as you see in the films, you see, beating somebody and all that \xe2\x80\x93 you just see it and you do not react. Anything that you think is very perverse, ugly, immoral, don\xe2\x80\x99t see. Finished. Gone.\n\nSo don\xe2\x80\x99t tax your mind because in the mind, that we call it, so-called mind, is actually the Agnya chakra in the centre of your optic chiasma.\n\nJust imagine, what a central place it has. And any disturbance to your Agnya, what it can do to your brain which is nothing but a lump of fat.\n\nSo, how this Agnya can affect you and how it works and creates perverted images: that is to be really seen. Conditionings also, you have seen people are mentally so upset and so degenerated.\n\nBut the pure nature of Christ is Innocence, you know that. He is Shri Ganesha. Shri Ganesha is a eternal child. Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t react, because He is not conditioned. Children are not conditioned so much as we are. If you talk to children, if you speak to them, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed how innocent they are and how innocently they talk. Once my granddaughter asked Me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of the poor children of the Tiger?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, their father tells them that you eat human beings and what can they do? They have to eat human beings, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d You see, so innocent. (laughing). So I told her that they are under a complete control of God. Whatever they are doing, they are not going to be held responsible. It\xe2\x80\x99s only for human beings that God has given this freedom. It\xe2\x80\x99s only human beings who can react in this manner. So, for animals, it is, they are pashus, means they are completely under the control of the God Almighty. So they are swabhavas, everything, a serpent will be a serpent and a tiger will be a tiger and they will, say a lion will be a lion.\n\nBut human beings can be a serpent, at the same time could be a scorpion, could be a lion, could be anything.\n\nYou know, suddenly, you find a small, little, bug-like man coming up like a lion roaring at you and you say, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom where does this come, this cannon?\xe2\x80\x9d It is so.\n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know which way they will come and which way the camel will sit. You can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\n\nSo this reaction of human beings comes because he is not in connection with the Divine. When he is in the connection with the Divine, he sees the drama and he leaves everything to Divine. He can solve all his problem by just one bandhan (Hindi words aside). He can solve all the problems just by a bandhan (Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers).\n\nBut he should be in full connection with the Divine.\n\nIt works. It works. It does work. This is not the time when Christ came on this Earth.\n\nThis is the time when this Paramachaitanya has gone into action \xe2\x80\x93 activated, is working out everything.\n\nNow they asked Me about these Shri Ganesha [statues] (Ganesh statues \xe2\x80\x98drank\xe2\x80\x99 milk on 21 September 1995 all over India), whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnything possible.\xe2\x80\x9d These days this Paramachaitanya is doing such things, unbelievable things, which we cannot understand. Everything is a chamatkar (miracle), so it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\n\nGaneshas, I have never heard of Ganesha liking milk so much, but maybe for the little rat He might be drinking. (Laughter)\n\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t say. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why did Shiva drink?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet it be. Let Shiva wants to drink, let Him have milk.\xe2\x80\x9d Actually, we have too much milk production so they must be wanting to consume some. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s just a way [of] looking at things that, you see, when everything is done by this Paramchaitanya. They are doing such wonderful things. I mean, I never asked them to do anything.\n\nBut now, for example, in Brisbane when I was there, I was sleeping in the ashram and the rainbow appeared. Of course, I like paintings very much of Raphael specially, because he has drawn the Mother\xe2\x80\x99s face and the Child\xe2\x80\x99s face so exactly expressing the feeling of Mother and the child.\n\nAnd imagine that picture appears in the sky. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell them to show that Raphael.\n\nWhen I was sleeping I was not even going to look at it.\n\nBut at this time the halo that was on the backside of Mary comes upon the head.\n\nMeans Raphael himself did it, or \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\nHow can I explain this? Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things; and it does all these just to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.\n\nBecause even now there are many who are supposed to be very rational, intelligent, educated who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to accept it.\n\nAfter all, if there is a Divine Power, if there is something like that and is active, how can you challenge it? How can you say no to it?\n\nBecause the powers are unlimited, it has gone into every atom and every molecule. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do tricks like moving this from there to there (like some false gurus - ed), but what it does is to do something which is absolutely impossible. It is doing it.\n\nSo, for us to believe in this activated Paramchaitanya is the only solution, so you leave it in the Ocean of Bliss and let this great power handle all the situations \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t react yourself \xe2\x80\x93 which is so efficient, so quick, so fast, moves all over, understands everything and it loves you and respects you because you are sahaja yogis. This is what it is today.\n\nWe should know, at the time when we are celebrating Christmas, that what we are celebrating is really our own ascent, our own achievements, our own lofty heights which we have achieved and which we have to achieve.\n\nWe should have only aspirations as far as our spiritual side is concerned. All aspirations should be left to this Paramchaitanya, \xe2\x80\x9cYou look after them.\xe2\x80\x9d And the more you become, the more you develop this non-reacting attitude through your proper Agnya - not anger, not silence, but a very pleasant temperament.\n\nThat means people think that I have told you not to speak. No, no, you must speak. You must talk to people, you must laugh, you must enjoy, but all this should be full of joyous feelings.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what they say that Christmas is for, a very joyous atmosphere. So they can\xe2\x80\x99t do that way, so they drink. I mean, after all, you must give them benefit of doubt also, that why do they drink. They think by drinking they will become joyous.\n\nNow our understanding about ourselves has to be very clear-cut. Specially people don\xe2\x80\x99t meditate. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t meditate. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to grow. They are sahaja yogis, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t meditate. It\xe2\x80\x99s very surprising. I can make out who meditates, who does not. Because there is no depth. They want to have this, they want to have that, is alright, but what about meditation? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t meditate, your Agnya will be completely covered with thoughts and you will be lost.\n\nSo, you have to meditate. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t meditate, I also suffer. If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to leave, because you are like seeds which are sprouted and which will be wasted.\n\nSome people are here because they want some sort of a platform, some publicity. Some are here who want money, to make money out of Sahaja Yoga. There are some who want to have a kind of a communication to go around the whole world without paying a single pai. All such people are of no use to themselves.\n\nNow here you have the complete wealth. All that celestial wealth is before you and you are not going to accept it. You are not going to drown into it. What should we say? This is not very sensible to do.\n\nAs I said, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to crucify yourself. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give up anything. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to live like Christ had to live or be born in the manger. All that\xe2\x80\x99s done for you already. Now, come along.\n\nBut if you are coming in the darbar (royal court) of the Divine, then be worth it. You should be worth it and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised, all your problems will be solved, your self-respect will be maintained.\n\nSo many things have happened like that, but if you have no self-respect, you don\xe2\x80\x99t respect your realisation, you are not deeply involved as to your own ascent and the help to others, it will not work out.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m here to tell you all these things which Christ could not tell and to fulfil what He wanted to say. All those things I am saying to you - it has already worked, you all have got realisation. But develop respect for yourself, as Sahaja Yogis. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have funny ideas about yourself; just know you are a Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogini. That\xe2\x80\x99s what is needed for a person if he is today celebrating the birth of Christ. He came on this Earth, who was actually Christ full of innocence who was the One who came as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha. I have given the proof of it to you how the carbon atom looks like and by which I have proved that Christ is the Alpha and Omega, while He is made out of Omkara and Swastika.\n\nAll this we have experimented. We have found it. It\xe2\x80\x99s there. With all this, what is the greatest achievement is to respect your innocence. Respect your innocence.\n\nThis is what is to be asked for today. Be innocent.
