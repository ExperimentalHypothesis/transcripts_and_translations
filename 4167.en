Christmas Puja. Ganapatipule (India), 25 December 1997.

Translated from Hindi:

He went back just for last three years and people fixed Him to a cross. It was somewhat destined. To open Agnya chakra He had to offer this sacrifice. So in this way He set up Agnya chakra. Agnya chakra is very constricted small and not easily openable because a human being got freedom that made him egoistic. This ego constricted his Agnya chakra. And from that constricted Agnya chakra it was necessary to take out ego And to take out ego you have to control your [MAAN]. But you do not take out your ego from your [MAAN] As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your [MAAN] the [MAAN] will go on increasing and the ego will go on increasing [ AHAAM KAROTI SAHA AHAMKAR ] We do ! It means that if we try to minimise our ego the ego will shoot up because we will try to do so with the help of ego only. Those who think that to our ego will suppress will eat less food worldwide violence one standing on one foot and some on their head Every type of experiment people do to destroy their ego But it does not supress the ego. It shoots up. To fast, to do [JAP TAP] everything shoots up ego ! [Havana] also gives rise to ego ! Because Agni is right sided. Whatever karmakand we do, rituals we perform gives rise to our ego. For the past thousands of years human beings have been doing the same type of karmakand. Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing. This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand. There is no need to do any karmakand. And to go to the extremes is all the more bad. As I said that to take away your ego you, in Marathi is called [' JODE PATTI'] beat 'it' with shoes. So daily in the morning Sahajyogis move out in a line with shoes in their hands. O.k ! but if you have ego, then only Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand. All this karmakand penetrated into Sahajyoga too. So much so that from France a gentleman came from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there. It is for sick people. If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand The karmakand of cancer are written in that. I said it is human being's nature to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it because of my karmakand, work will be done and in this karmakand not only you in foreign country also many people go on doing karmakand of various types. For example will go to church once a year. means today after that they don't take even the name of God. after doing all the dirty jobs of world and go to Catholic [ DHARAM ] and make confession If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi. If you can understand that this wrong act What we have done is wrong and now onwards this act is not to be done. If you can understand this your brain will retain it Now Karmakandis have got all the more qualities. One thing is that they are misers number one. If you talk to them about ten rupees they start jumping into the sky. That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK' One thing is that in Marathi there are such words That your ego will dissolve easily. For example somebody talked high of himself, i did this, i did that tell him in a low voice 'You are climbing a chickpea tree'. A chickpea tree doesn't exist ! [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] So he cools down. I did this, i did that, i Till this 'I' ness doesn't go till then our recognising Christ is wrong. But it is surprising that what is called Christian Nations where there is chritianity more than them egoistic I have not seen particularly English. American everybody is so much egoistic that can't understand these desciples of Christ. Now what is the remedy of this ego? that should be thought It's remedy was Jesus Christ and He has taught that now love everybody love your enemies too. It's remedy He said was 'Love'. and apart from 'Love' there is no remedy. But this 'Love' is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya. He said clearly,'Seek yourself'. knock the door and the door will open ! It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door. It means open the doors of your heart. A peson whose heart is small those who are misers that person can never be a Sahajyogi. And another thing which is very important if you get angry it means that you have too much ego. I have seen absolutely angry volatile people And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'. Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga. Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love' and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation no desire those who completely know to love selflessly only they can be in Sahajyoga. Egoistic people do wrong acts. I am tired of them. They will start something on their own and they won't even tell me. and by doing so Today thousands of questions have risen Today it is worth saying that in Delhi once they on the day of some puja hurriedly told me that we are getting land only this much. How much did we charge ? How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing ! And no Sahajyogi told me. Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so' leave that person. If I have to say something, I will tell myself. After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything. Now those who have given them money are holding their heads that they have been cheated ! How to get back that money ? Without asking Me all the work Absolutely without asking Me. The land is so bad that they have received a notice that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me and ask Me they made a society of their own and became mad that they are getting land It is such a bad land It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ? Now whatever has happened is foolishness ! and for that I am not responsible. But you ask for your money back. It is none of My resposibility. Jesus Christ had said that those people make houses live in houses they should watch birds he makes his own [GHARONDA] with how much love they make a small one for their ownself and when they make their home they feel a great joy in constructing that home He explained it in every way that you give up attatchment. This is my house. This is my land. They are my children. Even this much that it is my country. This attatchment should be given up. Then only you can be great. In the whole world you are brothers and sisters. It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country. Not at all ! If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything. Within you there should be devotion to country. But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world. If there is no devotion to one's country if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ? first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all. If you are working against your country you are not devoted to it. Jesus Christ had no need to go back. He had said also That there live such people Those who have the desire of only [MAL] are [MALECH] But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'. ' And teach them [NIRMAL TATTWA] the principle of purity. He went to teach them [NIRMAL TATTWAM] and they put an end to His life. It is mad people's country. He didn't need to learn anything. But had to teach something. That is why He went there. and for the same reason His end was this way. But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness' 'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra. If against anyone you have any ill feeling against anyone anger or if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone your Agnya cannot be up to the mark. Whatever you have to do you have to do with love. Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'. It doesn't mean that you spoil your children. To children you have to perfectly discipline If you cannot discipline children your children can never be good Sahajyogis. And for that you must be yourself disciplined. If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children. About Jesus Christ's life very little was written. But He was so disciplined In this way tolerated and from His life He showed He didn't need to be married He didn't marry It doesn't mean that He was against marriage. People have such wrong notions And that is why they have self made notions the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ He was Sakhshat Ganesha ! How can anyone be married to Him ? Apart from that Men also no to marry such unnatural/ uncultural concepts were taught.............. With that everyone can be kept under control but one cannot become Christian. like such [KRITRIM BANDHAN] to cover oneself today Chritian religion is losing its importance. They forgot Jesus ! and created a religion out of their own and call it Chritian religion. The Christian religion of today Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus ! Because I was born in this religion I saw the ins and outs of this religion. The same is the case with Hindu religion. In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all. Because your various gurus, real gurus like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies are your many incarnations and your Sayambus are many. You don't have one book. You have number of books. Only Jesus and Bible They can be fundamentalists. And they can be Yahudis also And all the three are related to each other. It is written in books. But a Hindu can never be communal. Because some have some guru and others a different guru. Some adore Mahalaxmi. Others Renuka Devi. Some to Krishna. So, every person every family individually adore incarnation, books. As such there is no book which can be called as Holy Bible. So to all the religions a Hindu should pay respect. The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus. Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible. They keep a Bible [IN THE ROOM] whether somebody reads or not. That Bible fell on the floor. There was one Hindu with us. He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table. They will never touch The Bible with their feet. The Christians will do so. A Hindu will never do so. To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma. But those who have come out of it are very very strange. Those who are our politicians such people have taken birth Asmushrooms come out in monsoon same way some people have come out. But they are not Hindus. They don't know anything about their [DHARMA] religion. North Indians don't know it at all. and those who are South Indians They know that bramhins have to be given money here and there have to do this and that [RITUALS]. In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand. They are so karmakandi. In Maharashtra I have worked very hard. Everything was waste. Because they are very ritualistic [KARMAKANDI]. They cannot give it up. Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak The Ganeshji that is there I have awakened that. Now what do I see that there one mile long long lines one mile long are standing on Tuesday. Gneshji too must have slept. The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra. Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot. And in North India also I have seen that some people are Karmakandi. And those who are Karmakandi they have lot of anger, are hot tempered. And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool. So the first thing is Stop ritualism. But respect everything. Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything. This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ. Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open. Everbody's respect and unnecessary ritualism in which wrong people are growing Now a day's false gurus They exist because of ritualism [KARMAKAND]. They will say you give so much money, do this do that. Do Havana 108 times daily read these names, those names giving you mantras doing this that These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand. Completely against which is Jesus Christ. Which He knew that by doing Karmakand a human being becomes egoistic. and to crack this ego To Karmakand He had forbidden tottaly. had forbidden totally. The same way, in the name of God anyone earning money was objectionable to Him. On the contrary reverse process started. Earn money and consume. They don't give up earning but [believe to] earn money and consume. It doesn't solve any problem. Today in Sahajyoga work We should remember how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work. How much money did we give? Jesus Christ had twelve fish killers. Even they spread in the whole world by working hard. Today you are so many disciples of mine. And if you want you can give realisation to so many people. Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga. But the people should not be half baked. They should be deep. Unless they are deep, they cannot understand. And for that the greatest thing is that how much we love them. And how much love they give to others. Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga he should remember first of all that the teaching of Jesus Christ to love everybody Am i doing that ? I shower my anger over everyone. I keep everybody under control I express my anger with my eyes. This ego is very much not only against Sahajyoga but his destructor Whosoever is egoistic should lessen it and replace it with love Life will be a pleasure. Life will be beautiful ! If you don't know how to love then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga. First you open the doors of your heart. With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread. The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga they have the Shakti [Power] of love less and the Shakti of anger more. It will never spread. With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish. The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand. Sorry I had to talk in Hindi language because most of the people here are Indians Some of them are Marathis and others are from North India. I was telling them about Christ. What was His power ? His power was of 'Love'. And not of anger Because He is the one who has crossed the most difficult center of Agnya. Those people who have ego never realise they have ego With their ego they do all kinds of nonsensical things. Without asking Me they have done something in Delhi. Without asking me they have done something in Russia. And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga. that they don't realise what they have done is the crime which is punishable by all Divine laws. If you want to do anything you must tell me beforehand. You must consult Me you must talk to Me Because I know what is happening. You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you. Then how will you know if you were so sensitive you would find out You would have asked Me, 'Mother what should we do ?' At least ask Me. This is the main thing missing among Sahajyogis now that we have a kind of a very subtle ego. If you make somebody a leader it is very dangerous sometimes if the leader developes ego because of his wife. It is a very difficult thing. They can destroy Sahajyoga completely. Anything is possible. So before you do anything like that you have to consult [Me]. I am still living and you can ask You can write to Me, you can telephone too. Atleast I am there to tell you but then you have to develop your balance and your love.

Shri Mataji continues to speak in English:

I'm sorry I had to talk in Hindi language because most of the people are, here, Indians. Some of them are Marathis and others are from the north of India.

I was telling them about Christ, what was his power. His power was of love and not of anger,  because he is the one who has crossed the most difficult centre of Agya.

Those people who have ego never realise they have ego. With their ego they do all kinds of nonsensical things. Without asking me they have done something in Delhi and without asking me they have done something in Russia. And it’s so destructive to Sahaja Yoga that they don’t realise what they have done is a crime which is punishable by all Divine laws! If you want to do anything you must tell me beforehand, you must consult me, you must talk to me because I know what is happening. You don’t know if somebody wants to cheat you, then how will you know? If you were so sensitive you would find out. You would have asked me, “Mother what should we do?” At least ask me. This is the main thing missing among Sahaja yogis now, that we have a kind of a very subtle ego. If you make somebody a leader it’s very dangerous sometimes if the leader develops ego because of his wife. It’s a very difficult thing. They can destroy Sahaja Yoga completely. Anything is possible.

So before you do anything like that you have to consult. I am still living and you can ask me. You can write to me, you can telephone to me. At least I am there to tell you. But then you have to develop your balance and your love. That is only through this Paramachaitanya. With this All-pervading Power of Divine love, you can develop that discretion, you can develop those special powers.

Even if somebody telephones to me, immediately I know what’s wrong with the person. I don’t say that you can become like me but at least you have vibrations, to see. Also see your own vibrations, how are you moving. Put a paper on your hand and you’ll see, it will start shaking before my photograph. With this ego you cannot go further.

Why did you come to Sahaja Yoga? You came here not to become some sort of a leader or some sort of a king but you came here to become a great Guru, as you asked me, “Gurupada dijiye.” For that you have to have, in Sahaja Yoga, a complete humility, natural humility, natural balance. This is what Christ has taught us.

At that time I don’t think people had that much ego. Ego is a modern ‘present’ to you. People get ego out of anything. For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad, I said “What’s the matter with her?“ So I asked my daughters, “What does she do?” they said, “Mummy, she knows how to make dolls.” For that she had ego. What is so great than to be a good Sahaja yogi? You may be the king, you may be anything. Now you see the prime ministers, and all of them, going to jail. What have they compared to you? They have no balance, they have no sense. What makes you as separate individuals, higher people?  [It’s] because you have no ego.

Now people try to remove their ego, there’s two types: so they will go on beating themselves with shoes. All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego. But all this you do with your mind! Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only. They become ascetic, they are the greatest egoists I must say. Hitler was the greatest ascetic, with his asceticism he became Hitler. If you want to become Hitler you become ascetic. In Sahaja Yoga you are not allowed, at all, all this asceticism. You have to be loving, affectionate, kind and disciplined. I must say this because when you are loving you go out of bounds sometimes because you have no discipline of Sahaja Yoga. ‘Loving’ doesn’t mean that you become like a Romeo and Juliet, it doesn’t mean that. You must have your balance through your discipline. If you have no discipline you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.

From the life of Christ we have to learn these things, that, unless and until we have these things we cannot become good Sahaja yogis.

Firstly ritualistic nature, secondly anger, thirdly miserliness. Like if you go to England it’s written there, “Save pounds by taking a taxi.” This is what it is: miserliness, where can we save money. “Mother, can you give concession?” It’s not some sort of a business I am doing here. “If you make it half price so many will come.” I am not using your money. I am using it for your buildings. All this I’ve got it (land and buildings of Ganapatipule). Of course my money also and your money. So many things I have done, the whole of Vashi, the whole of ashrams, in Delhi two ashrams, then the whole of school, and also land in Poona and other places. Now in Poona they want me to pay the land, to pay for everything, and Poona people are the, known Maharastrians to be great miserly, kunjush people. Even for their own ashram they would like me to pay, for everything! And then nicely go and sing bhajans. You see, they are good musicians that’s what they are. But very, very miserly people. Miserly people can never love; they love money. Egotistical people can never love because they love power: to control others. They think they are doing it for Sahaja Yoga, but [they are] not. Unless and until you do something for yourself and your ego, no use working for Sahaja Yoga.

Look at the Christ, he took birth in a very humble abode. But he was The King. And he lived with the poor and tried to save them. He saved the lepers, he saved so many people, there were twenty-one people were cured by him.

Now [with] Sahaja Yoga I don’t know how many thousands have been cured. But what is important is, if you are curing, know that you are not curing. It is the Divine Power that is curing. You are not doing anything. It’s best to be like that. I feel the same way, I’m doing nothing and I’m Nishkriya, doing nothing. But I’m not lazy. You should be active but all your activity should come from the Divine Power of love. First of all you must extend your hands for love. You extend your heart, extend your money, house, everything for love. Now if your wife doesn’t allow others to come in the house throw her out of the house, I don’t mind. Teach her how to be kind and generous. The other way round for the husband. Its very important, you have to be generous, you have to be kind and you have to be loving and sweet to others.

Christ only once went into temper, which he had a right to do that, when he saw people selling things in the temple. Same thing we have here (market stalls outside the gate of the Sahaja Yoga land in Ganapatipule). And if you don’t go and buy anything from them, they’ll be lost. But you only go and buy things from them because you have a habit of shopping . Anywhere people go they must shop, it’s a habit. Shopping they must do. They will not see the greenery, the beauty of nature, nothing.

When I went to so many countries with my husband, I had to go and see beautiful places like museums. I never used to shop. But when I have so many children, then I have to shop, so I would go for shops. But not the way that every place is for shopping. What is there to shop here when you have come here for your spiritual growth? In Mecca do they have any shops? This is the holier than holy. Why should you go to these shops, I can’t understand. I have told them not to have shops but you people are the ones who encourage. Who encouraged them to make money out of us? Nothing essential to buy there. Now you have come to the holy occasion. Here you have come for your worship.

In our Mahalakshmi temple, there are people who are selling garlands and things for the ladies hair, but they say it is for the goddess and they buy there, all the people who are coming, stupidly, and give it to the Brahmin in the temple and the Brahmin sells it back at a lower price; and his garlands are, I don’t know how many times, sold and bought and sold and bought because of the stupidity of the people who go there. If they have to take something they should buy from outside not at the place where you have come.

As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought there, or you came to Bombay, you could have bought there. But not in this place, we cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi. Otherwise why should we come here? That’s why Christ took a hunter and beat them, those who were selling things near the church. Now they don’t have. I have seen, near the church they don’t have. They have outside. But they sell other things. Like Catholic Church sells a wine called ‘Benedictine’, imagine. That’s another story. Christ went for a wedding and they had no wine, now in the Hebrew language ‘wine' means the juice of the grapes, it doesn’t mean fermented. So he converted water into that wine. You cannot convert water instantaneously into wine; wine has to rot, has to smell, the more it smells the best it is. But they think that Christ said you must drink! He never said that, he just converted it into wine meaning the taste of the juice of grapes. Once I went to some television and there was a very nice man, in Italy. He said “Mother you first give me realisation”. So I said, “Get some water!” I put my hand into it. “Now you drink it,” He said, “It is tasting like wine,” I said, “This is what Christ did.” He got his realisation. Instantaneously you cannot make wine. But if somebody dies, they will drink, if somebody is born, they will drink. At any cost, without drinking, they are not normal. But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed. They don’t want to drink, they have stopped drinking, their attention has become nice. It’s the whole thing is changed. This is the transformation that has worked: of which Christ has talked, Mohammed Sahib has talked. Everybody has talked about this particular time when people will get transformed. But even after transformation you do not want to become what you have to be - for which you have come here. You will be left behind. There’s a big transformation is taking place! In that transformation, also, your rising is taking place. There’s a big evolution going on and those who will not evolve properly will be left behind. As it is said that: this is the last judgement. And you will be judged. You will be left behind. You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher. With your weight you’ll fall down.

So, for you to understand Christ: it’s all his qualities you must have. If you are hot tempered, alright go and beat yourself with shoes, but if you are not then you need not. You must know what you are. First of all introspect. Accordingly you should work it out. But this ritualism is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga all the time. I would love all my children to be extremely loving and collective. Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason. And if you have to denounce you should tell me. I know what is what. Without asking me you should not measure up somebody and say, “I’ve measured somebody.” With what? What is your yardstick? You, yourself, are caught up in the web of ego. You cannot condemn anyone without telling me. You have to tell me. Don’t worry that this will disturb me or anything, but you should ask me.

I know about everyone, maybe I have not met that person, but I can feel the vibrations. You can write to me. Many people just telephone - that’s not the way! You must write to me because I read each and every letter. But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time, like, “My father’s, mother’s, mother’s, this thing is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.” All sorts of funny letters come to me. What can I do for such people? That’s not important. Or, “I need money, I have no money and I’m depending on you for money so please send me money.” (laughter) You can ask on my photograph. If you are a good Sahaja Yogi you don’t have to worry about money also. Or, “I have no child Mother, what to do? I want to have a child.” Those who have a child, ask them what do they have to say!! So many have got children after coming to Sahaja Yoga but you must deserve it.

So many miracles have taken place, so many people have been cured, no doubt. But that doesn’t mean you have done it. Don’t get into the trap of ego. That’s most dangerous. If you destroy Sahaja Yoga, you are destroying yourself.

So, today, you all have to promise in your heart . Put your hands to your heart and to say now, “Mother we’ll love. We’ll spread your Divine love, encompass the whole world. Give realisation to all the people. We’ll not shout. We’ll not be angry. We’ll not do all kinds of rituals. But just surrender, surrender our ego to you.” Surrender it, surrender your ego: all your problems can be solved. Because as long as there is ego this Divine power doesn’t take over. You may do anything, you are not connected, your connection is missing, Christ is missing, he is no more there. To establish him first of all you must show how you love, but that doesn’t mean that you love your wife, love your children and love your house! You have to love everyone. Try to make everyone happy. That’s why I like music because through music you can spread vibrations. It’s a very good media of spreading vibrations, of loving vibrations. But those who are musicians have to be loving people, not hot-tempered, not showing off, not thinking too much of themselves.

All this will work very well if we understand that this Divine Power is so powerful, and, no doubt it is love, no doubt it is truth or no doubt, if you get out of it you’ll be caught up by anything and you could be finished. It is a very, very powerful, effective, and absolutely conclusive power you have within yourself. And thanks to Christ that crucified himself, sacrificed his body for our sake, that our Agya is opened, otherwise I could not have done this Sahaja Yoga. But in this area we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira, and they had to do tapasya, tapaha. They did it. You don’t have to do now, they have done for you. Now, see, I saw the musicians yesterday, in two, three months they have learned so much. Otherwise, formerly, all the musicians I knew for Indian music had to really starve for months together, they had to practise for years together [and] they had to bow to their guru. That’s all over now because of this Paramachaitanya and your power to be one with the Divine. This Divine power can transform you completely to such an extent that anything that you want to do you can do it in two, three months.

In Pune when they were singing once, foreigners, as we call them,  with respect. In India ‘foreigners’ means respect, not like other countries. So they were singing [and] there were some very great musicians who had come and they told me, “Mother, we put down our head to them because how could these people, who don’t know a word about Indian music, have learnt it so well?”. “And the pronunciation of this Marathi language is very difficult but they are so good at it, it’s very surprising.” Now all this has happened in your presence, in your presence.

It’s nice you have balloons here to celebrate Christ’s birthday and all these balloons in your heads, of ego, should be burst, should be finished.

And I’ll be happy if you could learn Hindi language. I know English maybe not so good but best is to learn Hindi, if possible, because there are already fourteen languages in India and so many languages in other countries. Every country has a different type of English language. If you go to America I don’t understand their English for at least two or three days because they go on taking their tongue and their lips on one side and then on another side. English, and the French is another point. So best is to learn Hindi, and that too, a good Hindi, not Sanskritised (sic), but as they say “Roz-marrah ke” - day-to-day Hindi, because I feel better if you all understand what I am saying. It’s not difficult because you are all Sahaja yogis, you can learn Hindi in no time. I’m not saying learn Sanskrit! But Hindi is very easy. It’s not my mother tongue. I have never studied Hindi language, never. But it’s a very easy language to learn. But, as my Father told me, “Never teach Hindi language to an Englishman.” I said, “Why this advice?“ He said, “There was an Englishman who was after me that I should teach him Hindi.” So he said, “I have to tell my servant to open the door or to close the door. So to open the door he said you say, “There was a cold day” - means “darwaza khol de,” And for closing the door, you have to say, “There was a banker, ” “darwaza band karo.” But now it’s different. They’ll pick up Hindi very quickly, very quickly; I can see that. If they can learn this horrible Indian classical music, which is so difficult, so easily that will happen. They can learn Hindi in no time and make me happier with that, not because Hindi is my language, it’s not, it’s Marathi. But Marathi [is] very difficult. I don’t think you can learn Marathi. It’s very precise. I think that it’s one of the best languages to put down your ego. That’s why Maharashtrians are normally not egotistical because in their language there is built in process. For example, somebody is boasting, that, “I have done this, I have done that.” So in Marathi they will say, “Don’t climb on a bush or the tree of chana,” which is so big as that (very small bush). Then the person is finished! Like that there are many words by which you can put down the ego of the man on his face. So Marathi language has so many advantages. But I would not ask you to learn Marathi language, it’s not so easy. But Hindi you should, it is very easy, very easy. But you must know one thing, that in Hindi language there is adab. Adab means modesty and…

Babamama: respect, respect.

Shri Mataji: Respect, but more than respect it is. A style of saying things. Not Urdu, but Hindi of day to day talking, there is respect and a way to address others. All this will give you a kind of a more flexible vehicle to express your love. Because in Hindi language we can never translate, “I hate you,” we never say like that, “I hate you.” They cannot say because to hate somebody is sinful. So they can never say, “I hate you.” Chastity is more in Marathi language but it’s a little hard because it has got such, as I told you, idioms which can correct you, just there.

All this is just to request you now, if you can learn this music, which is very difficult, you can always learn a simple Hindi language which is very, very easy and very, very easy to talk.

There are so many things I would like you to know about Christ, but this is a short time in which I cannot tell you, the way he had his own priorities. Though in the Bible he’s not described fully, I should say, and whatever it might have been they have reduced it, maybe. And the way they practice Christianity also is shocking. So one has to learn Christianity through the heart, [there’s] no other way out. They should learn through the heart, heart of your Mother.

May God bless you all.

Normally after my lecture I give realisation to people - but you all have got it already. You can just put your hands and see for yourself if you have the cool breeze or not. And face yourself. If there is something wrong you must get it corrected. Better, better. Ta puja kara! (marathi: So let’s do the puja). Good!
