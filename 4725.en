Talk to Austrian Sahaja Yogi, Bordi (India) 13 (14?) February 1984.

Now Austria is a very important place, it is the bridge between the left and the right. We can say that now all Western Europe is becoming leftish because of the influence of alcohol and frustration from aggression and they've done their level best, now they have felt, because they are fed up with themselves, sort of, they have given up now.

And on this side is the German side, is the aggression side, those who are still trying to progress and temper and conquer and fight. Europe is divided unfortunately into two types of people now. The left-sided people are committing suicide and the right-sided people are still busy with aggressiveness and aggressive ideas. So between these two different things is Austria, it is a very important thing.

So this is a very strategic place where the left and right are bridged and the swing always moves from left to the right and right to the left. So there is a possibility that some of the Germans may try to take to the left-sided state. But when the right-sided person goes to the left-sided state, first thing happens to such a person is that he tries to jump on to the depraved side of the left side to begin with. You see like sex, depravity.

That is why you find that most of the communistic countries are extremely licentious, very licentious. They have no sense of morality left because they denied God, they say there is no God, that's how they can do what they like. You see, they have gone to the other extreme and now they are starting again parapsychology.

I mean you can say from Mooladhara, they are spoiling Mooladhara and the Swadisthana. So this is the situation that has started now. Under these circumstances you play a very important role as Austria and Austrians have been very important before also.

As you know that it was a very great country and Austria was regarded as one of the motherly countries. You've been a very balanced country. You had Maria Theresa, as a very great, great queen, I think, and all this happened there, there was a Raja-Lakshmi there. But to get the Mahalakshmi Spirit, to bring it to the Mahalakshmi, seeking should start.

One has to see these two channels within us because you are on the bridge. On one side it's to be very left sided and on the other side having Mooladhara problems, you might be having left-Swadisthana problem as well. So this is a very funny situation and very precarious. The existence of a bridge is always when you have both the banks, firmly attached, otherwise the bridge doesn't exist.

So with both the sides, with the left-side of Mooladhara and, I mean, I would say Germans now they are ruined in this thing, but still in morality, in Mooladhara they were better people. Russians are better people in Mooladhara. But now, they were, I should say, they were better, but after the war they have also gone down. After that aggression they have also gone down. You see, you must know Hitler was a very, very, he was like a Brahmachari he lead a very moral life, himself. See and that is how all this aggressiveness has now dropped down into the ditch and that's how they have gone into it.

That's why all Czechoslovakian, Yugoslavian, Polish, we can say Germans, Russians, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Rumanian, all of them are that type so how much they are affected, that aggressiveness has now collapsed into sex. Gone into that aggression and it's a great sin. So you play a very, very rightly role because you have to keep this balance and this bridge clean.

So now as you have traveled to India, I'm sure, you must have learnt about how the Indians live. So I would like to have your experiences said about what do you think. What have you learnt? What did you learn? Or you think it over, somewhere else.

Sahaja Yogi: The Indians are uncomplicated in contact with other persons, but ...

Shri Mataji: Louder, I can't hear because I had a bath, my whole body is vibrating too much......

Sahaja Yogi: One feels like a member of the family, one is Indian, one is never separated.

Shri Mataji: True, true...

Sahaja Yogi: Everything normal, one is welcome, but it is normal.

Shri Mataji: So you know what normal is now, because many people told me I don't know what is normal, you see, normal relationships are there, normal, it comes out of purity, everything normal is pure. That's the point is. Relationships are pure, you are guests here, whatever it is, you are guests.

You are children of your Mother, have come here as guests, that's all. That's that. Now the pure relationship between them and you is this, that you give your love to them as much as possible, look after them, don't complain, don't do this.

Sahaja Yogi: It is like in family. One knows and doesn't worry what the others should think about them.

Shri Mataji: Yes, they don't have so much brains, you see, to bother about as what others are thinking what others are doing that's not there, it's collective. It's a collective being. You are all working it out in this and what others are thinking makes no difference here. You see, what others are doing, they don't think about it, it does not much matter, it's a political idea as to what do they think because they have to take votes, you see.

Yet there is no voting because it is your own heart, which has to be so good and happy and all that because many people ask me what is normal because relative, if you live in a relative world, you must see what is normal. So now what about who else was here, you were here? Now you are coming now.

Sahaja Yogi: I have learnt that collectivity can be something wonderful, that people can understand one another, without problems, conflict.

Shri Mataji: And the peace you see it is possible. If you are not peaceful you cannot be there. You have to be peaceful within yourself, you see, a person who is peaceful within himself doesn't find anything wrong anywhere, except for himself.

You see I mean, you can see it so clearly. Like you see, you are going on a sea-watch, all right. Now a person who doesn't have a proper ship will say: "Oh, the sea is bad or so." But the person whose ship is seaworthy, first will say let me see the challenge, let me work it out. It's the peace within yourself, not the peace but that weight of the peace within us, the weight you see, of the peace makes you so balanced.

It's the peace within yourself. But how that this peace is and how does this peace come? Because you are efficient, all your chakras are efficient. You are working all right. So you are not bothered, you attract me to all.

So that's a good idea and I'm sorry, you can't do it before. But now it's all right. Now you're gone through it and you have to pass through it. Some of you might feel sad because of you have liver problems and all that, but be careful there.

Already, I've told them that they should to be given a vibrated piece of sugar for liver patients, this, that.

What about your marriage? Now you have been? Marcus? Marcus has been? Yes. What about you Marcus?

Sahaja Yogi: I have learnt a lot in many respects. First, Mother, I think it's great that I recognized you, I didn't recognize you before. This is the greatest gain for me. Also I have learned that the outside world is not important at all. After the first day, I didn't feel the impact of any inconveniences I had experienced, the whole journey was a learning process. And when something was not on schedule, I was knowing, You know, that's the best for us to wait and I really enjoyed it very much and I hope that I can fight the negativity in my country which definitely will expect us. But I'm sure it's just started, the real journey.

Shri Mataji: Is true, I tell you people in advance. So the kind of people you have it's quite funny, you allow Mr. Freud, a person like Freud to be. What's done in that country, it shows the intellectuals are really stupid people there, no doubt. But the people in India are wise, they are not intellectuals, they are wise and they have sensitivity. Nobody takes any time to get it, just I go to a village for the first time, they are all there, they just want it, no problem, because they are wise and they are simple-hearted. For the simple people, because their chitta is uncomplicated, it is very easy to understand somebody who is like that. That's why they have no problem.

I don't know because the ego is so much in the West, that how will they recognize me. You see, they only recognize themselves. They have no sense at all to recognize anything higher than them. They will never accept anybody higher except for a person like Hitler who comes with a funny idea, you see, of pampering their ego.

They are not going to recognize. It's a very big problem. I don't know what to do, how to make them recognize, very difficult. What do they doubt in? I just don't understand.

Now, some of them want to look like Marilyn Monroe. How can I look like Marilyn Monroe, was she a Goddess? After seeing all the temples you must have noticed why your Mother looks like this? She has to be like this, because that is the form which She has to give, that is the face She has to give, that's how the whole coefficient works out.

I just cannot make myself the way western people want me to. Like a six footer you see with high heels walking like a mosquito, I can't do. So what will make them recognize Me?

Sahaja Yogi: It would be the best for them to come to India!

Shri Mataji: That's the problem, you can see it yourself, even to arrange for hundred people is a difficult thing. But now we've done these 3 or 2 things and I was about to stop all that, but now I should say, I may have to continue for some time. But those who have been to India, now have to really contribute, write to people, go to your newspaper people, tell them this is not any story. This is our own Mother. Just get after their lives. You say, if you don't try, we are going to fight, but it's all right, say what you have seen, what has happened to you.

You should say, that She has come, believe, She is the Holy Ghost. Believe us it is so, just write it down. Those ridiculous, stupid people, you go to hell. Tell them that. Let them know that. Otherwise I can't have this going on forever. You see, this is very inconvenient, this sort of a thing, that we can only help one hundred people or two hundred people. But we can't let the whole of Austria, the whole of the world come here going round in Maharashtra.

Later on you all can start it, once I start building up places for you and you can all go and see places, settle down yourself, manage it that's the different point. But just now I think you can only live in wars which is a horrid thing. So the whole thing is much more important that a person like you, who gets an experience like that should go back and jump on their heads and tell them: "What are you up to?" These Indians are going to go ahead first, but you are all going to hell and the greatest thing is the third world war, which is inevitable.

But don't get into personal things, this personal nonsense is the worst of it. Think that you have to produce something productive. All right. Everyone of you is a big saint, is a great saint. Yesterday I told you the description of the Yoga and you knew about it. You have to become that, a ego is there, you've got the power of that dignity, of that power of that weight. You are the Gurus.

And these stupid people who have nothing in them, nothing, they don't know about Kundalini, nothing of the kind. They write books, they've become gurus. What about you? Each one of you? If you want, you can dress up like a guru, you'll see no difference. Whatever way you want to but just express on their head and go on their heads and tell them this is what is.

So then, you can say that She had a program in the college and She cured people, be prepared to tell about that. All right what about you? You were there.

Sahaja Yogi: I wanted to say that the difference between Indian and Western people is the difference between mind and heart. So I searched for possibilities to have contact with our Sahaja Yoga brothers from behind all this India. And it always was a little bit of opening my heart. I think it was You who opened my heart.

Shri Mataji: So they put Me in their heart, you see, that thing is. They have a large heart, they put Me there, really easily and the western mind, it goes to the mind first, goes to the mind and then they bring it to the heart, you see. But if supposing, I'm that, I'm the one who has to do the job, you see, you can't just do it with your intelligence, you can't use Me with your intelligence, you have to have the heart to flow Me down, you see. You see, it's a tremendous task I've come for and you have to have large hearts to take me in and this is what they understand.

You see they realize it, it's prophesized, it's told, they know what is God. She raises the Kundalini, finished. She is the one who has come, but you don't have the tradition. I say, I don't blame you also, because traditionally you don't know Me. They know Me traditionally. They've all the traditions with them. They've been brought up that way for thousands of years. That's why I've called you, to come here, to see for yourself, how they are living.

No question here, no, nothing, no quarrelling, no complaint. But they have a problem because outside they are most underdeveloped. If you see their buses they need a governor, if you see their telephones, doesn't work out, television doesn't work out, anything, no much, doesn't work out, horrible, and if you ask them how much time will it take to go somewhere, they will say, five minutes, it will be five hours. It's a big joke, you see.

So it is like that because it is accepted, they think to go beyond time, is the tapas, is the penance. To learn to go beyond time, to be worried about time, what time we are going to have food, what we are going to do. You have seen your Mother, how She works. You see, hours together, I've worked like this, I've no problem of time, the time is in our head.

And another problem with the western mind is, it is too much bound by that, you can't get over that, the time is the jail, the prison. They are sitting on a, say bus, now the bus takes too much time, go into meditation! Now, they've been worried, how it's taking very long. For what? It's the time now, they are worried. I know what you are thinking sometimes, now, I tell you, what you are thinking. I was with you, for I was traveling and I knew what was happening.

So they would think that: "Oh God, now this is going to, but what is the time for?" What are you going to time, do by saving time? Jumping in the river, it's not only thing, that you have to do, you have to meditate, it's a nice time you've got, just meditate and this is the attitude one should have, is that you have not come here to sort of enjoy one of the tours that we have, one of the holiday tours but you have come here, to overcome the bondage of time.

The bondage of conditioning, of comfort and the bondage of all kinds of conditioning we have had with our Ego. So we have come here, to overcome that, get rid of all that nonsense that is attacking, to become simple, uncomplicated. If you understand after all human beings are all the same, you are human beings, these Indians are also human beings, only that you have more comfort, you have more money, that's all.

That's it. What's there to be so superior about? Nothing, why should you have more comfort and these people live without that and are much more happy? You see Indians are much more happy people. Now who else was with us?

Sahaja Yogi: I would like to be more like Indians so that we can love you more Mother?

Shri Mataji: That's it. They love each other because they love Me. If you don't know your Mother, if you love your Mother, you love all men, everyone. That's the trouble, is you must know more about Me, talk about Me. But we discuss anything, this is quite true, this should have happened, that should have happened. You see the English mind is the same reflecting all the Europeans minds.

All the time try to correct others. This is the situation, this could have been better, that could have been better. Why did they put Me from here? This should not have been allowed. That now why did they put it on the road, they could have put it on the left hand side [Inaudible passage]

Good idea to put it right, they become, see, they sleep under the tree, they didn't clean [...] They'll go on thinking about everything else but themselves what they have to do. What others have to do, that is not your doing. You don't have to think about others, what they have to do, what you have to do, is to be seen.

You have to do simple things, to love your Mother and talk about Her and finished. Don't listen to any other talks. The loose talk is the worst thing and it's very common and you may think that Indians don't understand. They understand and know even what you talk, how you behave, what your attitude is, that you talk of something else than of your Mothers grace. It's the time to praise your Mother, it will give you vibrations, talk about her greatness, about how She loves you, what She has done for you, how you have changed, that is better than talk of others.

So this loose talk must be given up. And they love Me because they are simple people, they can see. But how to make these Johnies see Me through their big Ego on the eyes and on their heads, they are so blind. So it is your job now, I think that you have to talk about Me, to dedicate yourself.

Because after all you are born in that country or you belong to that country, you're to demand to give them something. This the only thing is, they call it in Sahaja Yoga as the Yuga-dharma of this Yuga. Sahaja Yoga is the dharma and that's what you talked about and in your heart, you have seen? That's a good idea to get rid of all problems. You'll say: "Mother, it's so simple", you'll become simple yourself.

Sahaja Yogi: I have noticed how Ego expresses in bad manners, this can be small things or very subtle things, e.g. it is really a bad habit to have loose conversation because it's a waste of time and a waste of energy.

Shri Mataji: That means you are frivolous, you're a shallow. You are not a dignified personality, if you talk frivolously.

Sahaja Yogi: It can also be a showing-off, you want to attract people, but there is nothing within you which has to attract people.

Shri Mataji: That's why this is glamour. You see this attraction, if a person is innately attractive he is not worry about this glamour. So this showing off and this and that is not good. One has to be very, very gentle and the gestures, also I've seen of people who are ego oriented. Very, very frivolous like this, that's not the way.

The dignity, the breed in your behavior, in everything, should be delicate, for ladies and also for men, not harsh, but there should be weight in everything. That is, there should be the weight of your dignity in everything that you do. That's what it lacks in people. And they talk frivolously.

I've heard, the drivers also say they are saints, but they don't talk like saints, but a certain concept is. Now another thing is that you are not our avataras, you are not our avataras, because avataras never make mistakes, you are not even a chavatar.

So once you understand that you are human and if you are not perfect, if you have to improve, you have to become much higher than what you are. You must give up all these things you have collected through this human ego. Only human beings have ego. Animals don't have, only human beings have. This is an inter-mediatory stage, where we should see in behavior also this is nonsense, this is not good. This is not the way to talk to human beings.

This is doglike and the dogs bark at each other. We must talk in a gentle way, in a sweet way and not discarding anybody, not hurting anyone. Even supposing I know that sometimes people get angry when they start taking a big attitude but you be careful. I know how to handle the situation. I can shout, it's all right but why do you want to shout but keep quiet and do it in a very meaningful way because you are the oceans, which are talking oceans, speaking oceans of amrut, despite all this.

You are the oceans of amrut. Amrut, you know, is the nectar of all. You are the oceans itself when you realize your situation. Just assume that ocean, that's described by a Angsharabaravagensha. He has described you like this. So do not have formed ideas that are in anyway contrary to the ideas of the saints. You are, that means, if you are that, that means you have to be humble.

But once I say that, then you become arrogant, typical human nature. If you tell them you are saints, when you are saints, then you become like a devil, behave like a devil, they say, no I'm a saint and do what you like. This typically human. On the contrary the divine nature is such, supposing you say: "Mother, you are the Primordial Desire." It doesn't give Me any pride or anything of that kind that because I don't know how to feel pride, because I am. So this is all what happens when you say that you get vibrations. It flows. So there's no pampering in any way but human beings if you...

The worst pampering does not exist in the Divine Law, nothing. They don't know what this pampering is. It's only possible for a pumpkin to do that, an egoistical fellow but not to a Divine personality. Because he can never pamper. So this is what one should be careful about, not to pamper, or get pampered. What I have said is, what you are actually, but when you are, they're extremely humble. And it is so evident.

They become all relations, all intimate, pure relationships. You do not fight with anyone, nothing. Everyone, it's a pure relationship. No siding if we have. Pure relationships are to be developed. Now have you all been for the first trip, no? Hamid, you must have been because Hamid has been very much appreciated by Dr. Sangue.

Shri Mataji is talking about agriculture. That the 4 agriculture specialists should meet. A kind of integration should take place.

First of all I told him (= Mr. Sangue) he must discuss with him all the modern ideas as you have and all that kind of an idea that anyone has, are to be first of all made Indianized.

For example in Austria you have to use machines to keep everything heated up. Here the Sun itself is supplying you a lot of heat and you don't have to do anything. You can use the Sun for heating you up and all that you don't have to do it.

And secondly when you bring it to the Indian soil they have those ideas how do there... And thirdly what you have to do is make it a Sahaja Yoga event that you see that how that Sahaja Yoga is worked through that and how we are going to improve the input now.

For example I've seen that hybrid cows. They are very bad. An Indian woman don't want to have their milk, because the children become very nasty, restless, this, that. So they won't have a hybrid cow. So I said all right, you give them vibrated water and it all changed. So you can have hybrid food produced according to the western ideas and give them vibrations. Like you people are hybrid people, because you have treated so many things.

But now with this hybrid you add vibrations, they will become perfectly all right, you've become greater saints than Indians are. So that's how we are going to work it out. That first of all we use all the western ideas and then treat it with Sahaja Yoga, no worries now.

The fourth most important thing for today is that you have to make statistics, you have to make data, how with Sahaja Yoga we have reached good results, like we use to divide plants in separate things. I've seen how these have given different feature.

For example now supposing we have hybrid, say a "popeye" all right. So it will be quite big inside but ... But supposing you add vibrations, it will become a very beautiful golden color to begin with and will not get bad so easily and thirdly it will have a delicious taste and fourthly it will be satisfying and people will be happy. So it has so many qualities that it will cure you, all right.

So this is what is to be understood, that the whole thing is for strong attacks. One is your ideas, brought in here. First it puts the whole Sahaja Yoga on it and the data and everything collected so that we make it acceptable to collective. This is my idea and if you can help Me with that, I should be very thankful. Now I've told you to make a project so, I can break the heads of the scientific people. They are very much guided by you, absolutely they are slaves to the western people. That's it.

They speak about the following process of the tour of Shri Mataji. Hamid tells Mother that he is afraid and doesn't know why. Shri Mataji advises him to put the left hand to her and right to Mother Earth.

No, it is for your education you have come, for assimilation of vibrations you have come. You've not come to give anything but you've come to take something. It's like a college you are in, a new studies you are in where you have to put in deliberate effort, all right?

So this is one thing, very important.

Gregoire says something: One must take lessons for oneself and not think lessons are only for others...

Shri Mataji: Now what you said is true, why it happens? I tell you now why it's happened, I tell you and it's so useless to happen. Like now supposing there is one Mr. X and one Mr. Y, there are two persons. Now I'm talking, so Mr. Y. is the one who is supposed to take all the hints, he has to improve himself, he has to chisel out himself, work it out himself. It is for his good. So Mr. Y. thinks of Mr. X. that Mr. X. must do it. Now what's the use? He cannot improve Mr. Y. You can improve a chair, you can improve a table, you can improve all that is dead, you can even improve your dog, you can improve all your animals.

But you can't improve another human being, can you? So what is the use of that you are doing? You have come here to get yourself chiseled out, you are here for that purpose. So why should you worry about others, you are not going to help him, you are going to help yourself. So why don't you work it out for yourself. That is for others is a common human nature. It is to just to escape. But why escape the truth which is the light, which is the joy which is the essence? Why? Why do you try to escape. That which is before you, this whole promise of beauty, why are you escaping it?

Just enter in, I've told you that you have to get into the Sushumna Nadi, for which you have to become. Now if there is a thing you are attached to better get rid of it that you must work it out. This is for everyone to see, that something wrong with others should not be seen, something wrong with yourself should not be seen and work it out and get rid of it then.

That is the reason for which you are here. Supposing you have an exam. Now you don't think that that boy has committed this mistake and I haven't committed this mistake. You think I've committed this mistake.

You think I have committed this mistake, I better work at it otherwise I'll fail in the exam. Isn't it? You don't think the other boys have done this way and I should see to him that he should not have written like that. Otherwise you have to pass the exam. Not him. It's like studying for another one, it is that stupid! Can you see that stupidity? It's a stupid habit. Think about the goad it's the most stupid thing.

But what you can do is to see the other in a way that would help you. Like another boy with a different heart, see how he is so good, what does he do. So the positive attitude of a person towards another person helps that person, not the other person.

You cannot improve the other person whatever you may do, but if you have that kind of an ideal within yourself then you do it, because the other one sees. But first become the idea, all right. So this is a very good point that we should not see the defects of others, see the defects of yourself and have the attitude that you have come here to go through this tapas, this penance. It is a penance in a way. But what a penance of joy, a penance of love. Like Gregoire, he himself told Me this kind of lessons are so, he has become much lighter, that's right.

After all I am a alone person, nobody could be near Me, who could be near Me? I'm absolutely alone. I have no companion. But the only thing is you feel it's come up-love, you feel you are with Me. Otherwise you are with Me always.

Gregoire speaks: It's like a bubble.

So may God bless you for that. But one thing I have tell you for all Europeans is to understand that sometimes it has been noticed by Me that you don't talk very kindly to Indians. You think they are our servants. Some time like that you should not misbehave and hurt people saying like that. Even when they are crowding round my feet, you should use these words, they never say this to you.

I mean you do misbehave many a time, you do quite a lot of wrong things but that's not our domain to say, you should take it gently. And the worst we do should not be so that it should be disparaging the character. Get out! Stop with that, let's be kind and gentle with them, take time. Please take time.

But people don't even look at what they say. Don't misbehave. I've heard it many a times with my own ears. But that's not the way to talk to them. They are also saints and they love Me and if they've come on my feet, I know they are stupid because they are not so organized, they don't understand that.

To them it's the greatest excitement they want just to fall at My feet. It is also always lacking in the west you see, you don't find that spontaneity, now. For that you have to be extremely gentle with them. You must understand they serve you not because of servitude. That's not a servitude, but it is out of their heart. They like you, they like to do everything for you. Even if you tell them: "My shoes are not all right". "I'll fix them for you". But one would think "Oh, they must be trying ... to get something out of me." No, it's not that.

You are guest and for a guest in this country will have always had the theory that guests are welcome and that's how we had English here. Now they are here since 300 years. They come as guests, they dominate us 300 years, can you imagine?

So this is what it is. So one has to learn these things about them, and they don't feel hurt because they don't understand the language, but still you are not doing any justice. You don't see them, you don't see them anywhere. Have you seen how many here are living? But it will all come. Tomorrow they will see the marriage. Nothing they are not show off, anything they are not like western people. Anything they go on like that. (Shri Mataji imitates hard breathing.)

You see western people they have to doing ha, ha, ha ... or they start jumping like that. Like Gregoire once told me like I told my daughter they were all sitting there for twenty-five of them outside her house in Hampstead and I told my daughter, "They all have their dinner." She said, "All right." This is not possible in the West, if you tell them you are going to invite people for dinner, they jump up and down, sideways. But you see because they take it in a style then they don't feel that it is necessary to make such fun.

But when they do it that way it should not be, you see, in a way treated that as if they are your servant or in anyway are lower than you and that will help you a lot, to learn a lot from them, because if you treat them as lower people in anyway they have not gained anything out of it, nothing, they don't get much. What is it he will buy? I can assure. They don't get much. Sometimes of course, I mean, I do supplement things for them.
