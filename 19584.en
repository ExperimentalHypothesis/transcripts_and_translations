Gregoire: Pratap Pawar is one of the best [Unclear] of Kathak in India. Kathak gives a traditional narrative form of dance which was popular, especially in northern India, centring on the stories of Shri Krishna and Shri Radha. And we have to understand the importance of this old tradition as it was a way to bring the life of God and the worship of God through gestures, through dance in the remotest villages of the country.

Pratap Pawar, a graduate of the [Unclear] university of Pandit [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: Real famous, a very great artist [Unclear]. Is one of the masters.

Gregoire: He taught Kathak for five years in the American International school and three years in the Northern school in New Delhi. He has played extensively in various countries such as Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, South Africa, West Indies and Indonesia and also UK, where we had the privileged of seeing him a few days ago in a wonderful programme which was praised by Shri Mataji and Mr C.P. Srivastava. And he played in Thailand and the USA where he was acclaimed as one of the greatest artist in his art. He worked for eight years as a Student Chorographer in South America, West Indies on behalf of the government of India. Pratap and Priya Pawar they have been taking part in worlds music conference and TV shows in many parts of the world and are present [Unclear] Vidya [Unclear] in London. Priya Pawar is then dance, dancing with her husband and a vigorous training in both Kathak and Odissi.

Shri Mataji: Do start, start as soon as he [Unclear].

Gregoire: - from the?

Gregoire: She was taught Odissi dance style by guru [Unclear] Mahat Hare Krishna Behera. Then she also a remarkable artist which have been widely recommended and praised by the connoisseur of the art. Perhaps I could, shortly introduce the musicians. At the tabla we will have Markandeya Mishra. At the sarangi....

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].

Gregoire: Sorry.

Shri Mataji: Many very great artists are there.

Gregoire: Who is?

Shri Mataji: Markandeya ...

Gregoire: Pandit? Eh okay.

At the tabla we will have Pandit Markendeya Mishra who Shri Mataji says is also a very great and renowned artist. At the sarangi will have Mr. Nicolas Mc Grill and we also will have Mr. Prashant Pawar playing on [Unclear].

The program perhaps very shortly, will start with a praise, the prayer, Shantakaram Lakshmi Kantam a prayer in worship of Shri Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi and then the mime and the gestures of Pratap and Priya will express how they pay homage to Lord Vishnu who is as we all know is the protector of the whole universe and the inspirer of many great sages. And leading us to the Nabhi chakra of Shri Mataji.

The second performance will be 'Mangala Charan' an invocation dedicated to Lord Ganesha...

Shri Mataji: It's always in a [Unclear] puja as it's so, they will take the name of Shri Vishnu first because of the ascent because of the evolutionary part so it's always twenty-one names of this part and then they say the Ganesha because first we prepare ourselves and then we do the Ganesha at first to bring Ganesha from, Ganesha til it starts but our desire will be expressed through Vishuddhi, we want our ascent.

Gregoire: The third performance it's called a rosary of rhythm. It is a more technical performance which will be a representation of Kathak by Sri Pratap combined to the musician in the traditional way, emphasising the rhythmic aspects of the style.

The fourth, performance is called Moksha and probably Sri Pratap will himself introduce it. Then we have a performance called [Unclear] Tavana Palave, Palave means elaboration. Here the dancer elaborates the body through lyrical movements set to the driving force six and seven beatsâ€™ times cycle. The music is based on [Unclear] Fraga kalanak Six and Seventh performance of the students of Sri Pratap recommended by himself and the last performance will be Jugalbandi ...Shri Mataji: Jugalbandi.

Gregoire: Jugalbandi.

Then on Jugalbandi, Sri Pratap will also himself...

Shri Mataji: No, both of them. This is Maya. You've gone and mixed two persons.

Gregoire: Ah, so it will be a dual between the two artists.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. Two minutes and I'll see... just two minutes.At the very outset we have to thank Pratap Pawar for this program, that he's doing a tour, graciously and so generously and he came to me and he told that he wants to dance in My presences sometime, somewhere and it would be a good idea, just to surrender to his dancing and we found that this was the best time, a opportune time to start dancing. I see rather late to see the... also artist, there boons are built up in a time because of their spontaneity of the art as it is but he is going to perform it and you'll see that they go into their exuberance how they are trying to get the best out of it. Only thing I have to tell you, one thing that in India that a artist is very much excepted so much so that, I've never sat before an artist on a coach, [Unclear] if he sits on a chair it's all right. But then an artist is given respect because an artist in India always expresses the God's will, devotion to God, meditation to God all connected to something so sublime and that's how we have to be very, very thankful to Mr Pawar and Mr Mishra and all his family who have come here, Mrs Pawar is another very, very great dancer and has a very nice feeling and a good housewife and has a daughter and a son are also realised souls. It's a very great [Unclear] for all of us and also, we have to thank the Sahaj Yogis, we have been given some lessons in Indian dancing and at the very outset I would like to thank all of them and bless them, fully with my heart that they should do India art and to the rhythmic patterns build up Sahaja Yoga within the hearts of the people.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].

Pratap Pawar: Mother. Dear brothers and sisters, tonight is very special occasion for myself and my colleagues because we have come to see, praise Shri Mataji, it's a very special occasion. This very style you are witnessing is kathak dance which was born in the temples of Krishna [Unclear], pranam though today we can involve modifications and subjugations of collectivity and ask for a more conscious presentation but the story is the same. Now, this is both aspects of the study, the dancers they speak to the audience, just by better understanding. For example, I'm will do one [Unclear] which we have communication of clap and stamp the ground and the first, the beginning the clap will be while there's a small and more closer when we bring in the climax together.

The next dance is the pirouette, the spinning. As [Unclear] the dance name which has twenty-one continuous spins...

Twenty-one spins.[Unclear] done is a pause, [Unclear] bayrum without pause. I'll speak one pattern, one break.

This particular style of Kathak has got many aspects as you can see, we are trying to cover everything as possible. Here's another one, an improvisation which just born on the spot, on the spare of the moment and sometime we have to do with that. Now Mishra played something very beautiful. So far, he has become, he has being accompanying me, now I will try to do his beats but what he just played now, I'll request him to play it again and I will try to interpret him, he just improvisation in front of you.

Shri Mataji: Spontaneous heart!, See the spontaneous heart, that's the beauty of Indian art, it's a play.

Pratap: On Mother is saying, She is very kind and I can explain to you more, see it's spontaneous, this virtue, you just, you play and he inspired me. And I'd tried my best to bring it up.

Now. So far, I have been showing you the technique, more faster things. Now I come to the expression, the facial expression. First, I'll show you, just a beautiful gate and then I'll show you five different ways of covering and praying on the faces, traditionally speaking in India, ladies cover their beautiful faces with the vale. Now Kathak dancer, no matter the main dancer essentially has to show all the aspects of the [Unclear] divine. So, I show you while you been opening the way, [Unclear].

Vale.

[Unclear] is extremely shy, [Unclear].

The next one. When I look to my left, Lord Krishna and when I look to my right, His consort, Radha. Similar expression, Krishna and Radha, I will use, flute or vale or the nose ring. Just with the eyes, Krishna and Radha.

We started very late, for various reasons and naturally we have to cut it the program and again with our minds but I'm trying to [Unclear]...as much as possible, we a few technical problems we have. Since you are so much enjoying the expression, I'll show you Shiva Pranam, Lord Shiva. Can you just breath. You are enjoying, you bear with me on the improvisation and having a live stand. Now Lord Shiva the one who did Ganga in His head. The one who have taken the poison for the benefit of the universe. The one who has got Vishnu in His hand and snakes, that are always on His neck and arms. That Lord Shiva does...

We are taking you to the other side of the evening because I am, you are enjoying the performance but I'm looking forward to something with that I'll tell you later on. The next item is Moksha by coincidence, our friend, let it all out in the beginning when I was expecting him, to tell you one by one but that was also improvisation. Yes, he just go over the last moves anyway next one is Moksha, the salvation. Where we witness in the Odissi style, it's a very different style from this one. Moksha as you all know, the ultimate place by coincidence the atoms come general in the last breath. After than pair we do again Kathak but this is the last Odissi style, Moksha.

Shri Mataji: We can walk that way.

Shri Mataji: Come here, come here. Perhaps those who are in the performance come forward a little bit.

Pratap: Respected Mother and colleagues as I told you earlier that you are already in the performance, I did my best when I admittedly wait till the end. As you know this occasion, I don't want to tell all of you. This is Guru puja so every discipline is expected to offer something and [Unclear] I didn't do anything much to offer, Mother. I brought a small offering that is in a form dance then seven Sahaja yogis from [Unclear] Russian are coming to my dance classes. They are very powerful now, they just they, happily they started and they come once a week and there's nothing but I keep on telling them in regularly time, [Unclear] visit 8th of a city approximately and they hardly get once in seven days, you can imagine how many times they got to learn. So, this is, I won't call this a dance, I would call this as humble offering from me to Mother in the form of seven Sahaja yogis presently [Unclear].

That act as it follows by my daughter, she will do one small impression, again another offering. First time Mother will see her on here. The names of Sahaja Yogis, [Unclear] Ant, Gent, Luram, Pedro, Alan, Paul and Eric.

Shri Mataji: Thank you for teaching the Sahaja Yogis. You see, didn't ask me [Unclear].

Come here.

Pratap: It's okay I think, Hindi or Marathi.

Shri Mataji: Pratap?

[Hindi or Marathi, spoken between Shri Mataji & Pratap]

[Pratap counting in the first sixteen beats].Pratap: They are offering the flowers, the flowers.I hope Mother has blessed us all. I arrange one of us, [Unclear] I asked my daughter who won't believe, she can even do [Unclear] soon. And I said she will be done but as I'll say it's not a performance [Unclear] I'm quite puja, she will do a smaller one.One, last practice she takes twenty-seven spins.

I think our very dear friend and colleague Pandit Markendeya Mishra who is playing raaga's on tabla, definitely deserves a very big well done, a hand. Many times, people wonder that, what is this instrument, thoroughly keep on playing this one [Unclear] taal or til all the time. [Unclear] stay very long and perhaps they don't know this instrument plays most important role in the whole sequence than is keeping the right time with a beautiful manner. When we play inside for example in doing cycles of sixteen. He does all the time keeping the measurement as a clock, of course with a beautiful melody. And then only could be judged with a drummer and dancer coming together all right or not. So he plays a very important role, Mr Nicolas [Unclear] Ryhee

Clapping.

The concluding number of [this] evening is Jugalbandi and do it a friendly contest between two dancers obviously happens to be me and my wife.

[Laughter]

This last number is a friendly fight or a friendly contest you can call it. Before we both come and display this beautiful number, I am blessed to share with to play two or three little things for you. Mother always likes [Unclear] Mishra solo. Now we will play two or three nice pieces to play...

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]

Pratap: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]

Pratap: So, we'll come back to you meanwhile and put it on position because they are [Unclear].

Pandit: I little bit play [Unclear] and stop, how to bring it. [Unclear].

Pandit: Sinking, a slow speed and then double and how the change is so, in a different way.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]

Pratap: Very patience [Unclear] from Jaipur's to [Unclear], there's two dance moves in Kathak, Lucknow and Jaipur. Jaipur is quite vigorous in her own way. Taking one 'dha' she will take two spins, dha, dha.

Priya: I'll try.

Pratap: She says ''I'll try''.

She'll manage. Again, we will read each other. I will see how many spins she will take.

Priya: At the end try to thirty-one.

Pratap: She said she will take thirty-one around. Thirty-one pirouettes, [Unclear].

Thirty-one spins!

I'll tell you one thing this moment otherwise I will fail admittedly, praising my wife but I do have a lot of care for her and as a dancer. Last, almost a year has gone. She takes this particular which has got thirty-one spins but almost a year has gone and I've been asking to take it and she thinks, she can't make it any more.

[Laughter]

Very honest to her, I am sure you all enjoying, sitting, standing in front of Mother....

Priya: Because of you.

Pratap: There's nothing to make up. So, I was in the dressing room, my daughter, that your daughter was - she was doing twenty-seven so far! She has been twenty-seven, she has been doing twenty-seven spins so far, in the last I know she did twenty-seven. Just as I told her in the dressing room, your daughter has done twenty-seven already on stage! And I, myself was thinking what she will do and I never expected she will do twenty - fifty-one and I never expected she will be able to do fifty-one! Frankly, speaking, I'm very honest and I think because of Mother's blessing [Unclear].

Just continue a while, friendly contest, little bit... I try and take more than fifty-one. Here we go!

A very last thing, we will create a certain effect, you saw on taps the ground with his feet and up in the air, it creates two sound and we are [Unclear] a lot about with five minutes beats with try, control with extent. And [Unclear] with one or two is a ringing and then will come the last beat, but If I give a clap, join in.

[Applause. A Yogi gives Priya flowers].

Shri Mataji: It's one of the most musically experiences I've had. On the Guru puja, to see the dance and so many beautiful children and their guru who really is a master of Kathak and his friend [Palike- unclear] another master. Now on Guru puja day anyone have come to worship Me. I don't know what I should do for, give for another guru.

[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: It is my style, so of course, children, mother has all the blessings and she is the enabler, the way they're prospered, may God bless them with His beautiful heart which is a service of God and you'll see better days and better days of expression through art the love of God. A small thing that I can give to them is my photograph in which I'm no more an actress, not a dancer but a simple Mother.

Shri Mataji looking through photos of Her, to give to Pandit and Priya. Shri Mataji speaking to the performers in Hindi or Marathi.

Shri Mataji: ...and as to all my children also.

[Unclear] we thank the artists for this great opportunity that they came and I know there is a little time problem but if I tell you one thing, you'll be happy to know that [Unclear] has to be done according to the auspicious time and the Guru puja actually starts at ten o'clock in the night so we could not have had the program and that's why. Our [Unclear] which I have brought on to them in which the blessing [Unclear]. That some, Mrs Pawarâ€™s dance so well and you did everything right. So, we have to go with the [Unclear] according to today's program was very short.

May God bless you.

So, tomorrow you'll get up for the meditation in the morning we must have a meditation about six o'clock. And then we have, breakfast after breakfast we have a program of starting the puja. Try to start at nine o'clock.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
