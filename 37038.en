[Hindi to English translation]

From ancient times, on this auspicious day (Akshay Trutiya), people asked God for many things. For example, many people ask on this day that - God let it rain in Maharashtra so our farms will get good produce. Asking that is okay that farms should get good produce, that it should rain, people should get food. And beyond that? You did not ask for anything eternal. It will rain, and people will get food, but this is not something that is eternal, which cannot be bypassed, and that you will not have to see scarcity again here - nobody can say that. And what happens if it rains? Then they will again do things by which they will displease the Divine, and then again there will be no rainfall. The human mind is such; when asking God, they don't think why such a situation has come, or what mistake have we committed.

Now in Maharashtra, a lot of prosperity came, and sugar factories came up which started producing a lot of sugar. And after that, they started making alcohol. They did not think that by making alcohol, they will make money but they are acting against the Divine. And in this kali yuga...ever since the Kruta-yuga (age of action) has started, now these things will not be tolerated for long... They started making alcohol, in that they brought politics, and caused losses to the poor. Those who grew a lot of sugarcane became crazy - they started saying that they do not believe in God, there is no such thing as God, and everything is sugarcane - even their God and worship was sugarcane. But now, when they are getting hit by sugarcane, then on Akshay Trutiya day they are saying, Mother please let it rain. But again you are arranging to be hit by the sugarcane.

It does not come to our attention that let us think of something eternal or manage to get something eternal. There are many who ask for other types of things. It's all a joke, a drama, when people ask for things they have weaknesses or hidden temptations for. Okay, since it has been asked on this day, it has to be granted - the Divine is bound by that and says: okay take whatever you want. So someone says, I want a such a wife - that She should be "sulakshani" (having good/auspicious characteristics), she should take care of home & outside, and should be beautiful. Given. But your eyes are still roving after other women; you did not achieve an eternal state/position (अक्षय पद). Then if the wife's health goes down or you catch some disease, then you will say how did this happen? This is bound to happen.

Whatever thing you ask for, ask in its pure form, in its purity, then it can go in eternal position (अक्षय पद). Like you asked for rainfall, God has to give it. But what is its pure form? -- You ask for rain so that Maharashtra should never face scarcity again. And that people become happy (सुखी). But you didn't arrange for that, you again started selling it expensive, did all kinds of wrong things, sent sugar to Arab lands from here, and now the poor here have no sugar to eat -- then it so happened that you were declared bankrupt, you were left with no money, the bank declared you bankrupt. You say you had asked this in an eternal state, but you did not ask for an eternal state, also you also did not ask for it in its purity.

Asking in purity means that, if you ask for rainfall in purity and if God gracefully grants it, then you should think that this rain is a God's blessing, but are we worthy of that blessing? From the earth what we grow, are we using that only for our selfish purposes and all kinds of theft and cheapish things, or we are using this blessing to glorify God? What are we doing for God's glory? God has blessed us, what are we doing for his glory? When this thought settles in the mind, then the thing becomes pure. You got a wife who is beautiful, what have you done, what transformation have you brought in yourself, how have you expressed your husbandliness completely with her, or told her about your loyalty, have you given up bad company and taken up good company? We should think that when God blessed us, what did we give to him?

Pushpam-Phalam-Toyam (Flowers, Fruit, Water) whatever you give, God accepts it. Ok, you gave flowers, fruit, and water, and God got satisfied, and on Akshay Trutiya day,  you surely get what you ask for, you will get it, but for some time, not forever. Whatever temptations you go on asking for, those will keep getting fulfilled, especially for Sahaja Yogis there are so many temptations - of all kinds: you will get money, name, reputation, you will look young and beautiful, you will get married, will get comfortable in every way, health will improve, everything will happen -- but not the eternal state (अक्षय पद). The eternal state (अक्षय-पद) is not a temptation, it is a state. Dhruv had asked for the eternal state. Dhruv told God you give me just the eternal state, and I do not want anything else. The position/state that he got: he is still shining in the sky (the pole star). Many times in London I see him. Pralhad asked God for the eternal state, and nobody could destroy him - he was burned, put into a furnace, thrown down from heights, he could not be destroyed in any way; and after that, when Shri Vishnu came into the world as Shri Narasinha and destroyed Hiranyakashyapu (Pralhad's father, a rakshasa), and he asked Pralhad what did he want, so Pralhad said, God, I do not want anything. Only after getting the eternal state (अक्षय-पद), does everything become eternal, because the outlook changes, thinking changes, complete character changes, and understanding changes.

In India especially, asking for the eternal state is very important. Because I see that in foreign countries, people have achieved everything, seen it, understood it, and now the situation is such that there is nothing to ask for. There is nothing in worldly things, it's all absurd, why ask for that? All done: did sins, good deeds (punyas), pilgrimages of all kinds, finished all that, but still did not get the Divine, did not get the eternal state. So it is surprising that in comparison with Indian Sahaja Yogis, the foreign Sahaja Yogis have more depth. Except Sahaja Yoga, they do not want anything else, except the eternal state, they do not want anything else. If I ask them all to drown in the sea, they will all drown, if I ask them to climb up a mountain, they will climb up the mountain. They don't care about anything in the world. And when they come here to India, if they get married here or something, and they see that Sahaja Yogis here come in Sahaja Yoga only for selfish purposes - someone wants something, someone wants a job, someone wants to be cured of illness; nobody is in joy -- very few - there are some, not that there are none. They get very surprised that in this land where tremendous vibrations flow, where everywhere in the environment there are echoes of Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, such big incarnations happened here, so many big personalities came into the world here - in the history and Puranas, where else such big things happened? And why do Sahaja Yogis here have such half-hearted things in them? They find it unbelievable. They think about Indians that these are forms of the divine, but slowly as they start looking for that divine, they feel that there is not even the spirit - just some sort of selfishness - instead of charity only selfishness is seen, and they get very surprised. They say, these all are living in the ocean of ambrosia (amruta) and what are they asking for, mud? - so what is going on? They can't believe it. They still don't understand. They still say, no-no we can't understand, we are not able to see clearly yet, these people (Indian yogis) are very high, this that... no matter how much they are told, but they are ready to touch your feet - "by touching these yogis' feet, we will reach a high eternal state."

In such an atmosphere, today we are celebrating this great auspicious occasion of Akshay Trutiya. Being a Sahaja Yogi, you must only ask for the eternal state, such an eternal state from which you do not fall down. A man who walks 5 steps then falls down 10 steps - when will he reach the top? In math, I had seen such type of problems, that when will such a person reach the top -- I said, what will he reach, he's moving in the opposite direction, if he changes his direction to the opposite direction, then he may reach, but otherwise, such a person will never reach, that he climbs so much and then again falls down, I say why does he even climb, his capacity to fall is greater, so he should just sit at home, no need take the trouble. And in small things we see his ego - the Indian ego - shows itself, and I keep seeing what to say to them and how to explain, that keep this ego aside and become a Sahaja Yogi. And it (ego) shows itself in such ways, for example, "we are Marathis", or "we Hindusthanis, meaning Hindi-speaking Indians, rest all are useless", or "we are Punjabis", and it starts like this one after the other; then, "we, residents of Pune", "in Pune, we live on that street", "on that street we live in that row." The currents of Sahaja Yoga are now flowing in such a way that you have left all things and have got swept away in it, and the drop has to become the ocean. And if not, then why do you come to Sahaja Yoga and bother?

Today you have to ask only that Mother, please grant us the eternal state. I will make all the rest of arrangements; if you want rain - it will rain, if you want cool air - cool breeze is blowing, the temperature has to be brought down - it is coming down, if it is to be increased - it can be, everything can happen. The only thing, from within you should ask for, with complete devotion is that we want the eternal state (अक्षय पद). There should be no pretense or hypocrisy in that: nothing will come out of it. What can you tell or explain someone who is intentionally pretensive and hypocritical? With full heart, "Mother please grant us the eternal state (Akshay-pada, अक्षय-पद)," and by asking for it today, you may even get it, but you have to bear it. If you ask for a crown weighing 10 maunds, can you wear it? You should be given what you can bear. You can ask for anything, but you should be able to bear it. If you cannot bear it, what is the use of giving it to you? The Divine has that understanding - everybody's record is in the computer. The Divine knows what you can get, bear, and be given. And in that understanding, it plays with you and puts you into temptation and you also are seen roaming about in those temptations.

Now we laugh at those who go to temples in the name of religion like madmen and bind themselves in every way by ritualism, and those who foolishly do strange things in the name of God like taking out palaquins (paalkhi), going somewhere and making bhoots (ghosts) dance in temples, somewhere they are fasting, somewhere chanting the name of Rama, all this is funny. But even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, those who are using it only to satisfy their ego or conditionings should understand, it's a very subtle thing... Now someone may say, "Mother, give me such a heart"...now you have been given a heart, now how many hearts do you want? -- "give me such a heart that it will only seek the eternal state all the time". Now you seek that with the same heart you have, for a second heart, a transplant will be needed, or it will go to the next life, in this life you have to do with this heart itself, and it is in this heart that you should especially understand that you are a Sahaja Yogi. This is a great feat. Has anyone heard of tamarind tree bearing apples? Today, in Kali-yuga, Sahaja Yogis are coming up like fruit. In Kali-yuga. It's like roses blooming in thorns, no one has seen roses blossom out from thorns, roses grow among thorns, but it is as though roses have blossomed out of cactus, it's a big miracle that in this dirty world, in this world full of sins, you have bloomed like lotuses; but its fragrance has yet not come out in life. So eternal state would mean that this blossom comes, this joy comes, we just sit in this joy, this is the eternal state, this is niranand, this is to be achieved, it is its light. Which you can call as a unshakable state from where a person does not fall.  Because that joy itself is spread all around like ocean, and the ocean is tossing you up again and again, and in that bounce, you are sitting blissfully and enjoying it. It is not difficult to come up to this state, only this heart thould be clean and the brain also - which gets a lot of useless thoughts in the mind. The guru state that you have got, the innate intelligence (प्रज्ञा) that has awakened within you by whose support we innately understand what is right and what is wrong, by that innate intelligence you can understand if you are standing on the principle of purity, on the pure desire, and if you have thought everything on the pure desire.

Moving forward in this regard, we see that people get angry for small-small things. Like now I have come here...there are people who have never met me, they are here, it has been years, they are doing the work, but...if we meet, we mee, otherwise not, they are sitting in bliss and enjoying, they have no grudge or complaint... if you ask them what are you doing? They say, "Loving Mother." Where, here? "You see this stone, I am seeing Mother in that." Such people are also there. And the other type are the short-tempered, if they come and if I do not become present immediately to salute them, they get upset that "they did not allow me to meet Mother, such rude people are surrounding, they don't allow meeting with Mother, otherwise Mother wants to meet everyone." It is a very small thing to understand. When Mother is everywhere and everywhere cuckoo sings, and when the cool breeze blows everywhere, then what is special about meeting such Mother? It is ego that I am someone special and Mother must meet me, that I intentionally took time out to come here. That may be so, but did you take Mother's appointment or you just came? Or you just asked in a program, Mother should I come, what will Mother say, don't come? Ok, come. Then they come with all their baggage, if they are told that Mother can't meet, then they say, "you guys are bad, you are lying, nobody can teach me."

Today I am saying this because these are everyday experiences in this city of Pune. And the poor people who are standing by me and are told to communicate, these people trouble them every day, and I feel very sad to see them going through these duels everyday. We have very little of this wisdom. In that they complain to me about small things. Sometimes it is very surprising. The thought of any kind of penance does not come in a person's heart. For getting the eternal state, (people seem to suggest) "I'm sitting here, give it here on a silver platter, then I will take it.": Okay, here, take it in a silver platter, at least now eat..."no, this had less salt, this had less sugar, this had less rice, this had less of that"...Okay, now everything is fixed, now eat..."no, won't eat unless you stand with folded hands in front of me", okay now I stand with folded hands before you, now eat...then: "okay I ate but I will not take the taste, you take the taste.": Then why did I work so hard? I cooked with so much effort, you taste it and enjoy it..."no, you take the taste, we will just keep complaining because the pleasure from complaining is in enjoying taste." This is my experience. Taste it first and then speak. Even after so much explanation, and explaining with so much love. To flow in the flow of Sahaja Yoga, you need some character, and that is lacking. And nothing is to be done to get that character, nothing is to be adopted, nothing is to be given, you just have to dissolve in it, and that's a very easy thing to do. I see an ordinary person who might have come to my program and has attained Sahaja Yoga, you will be amazed if you listen to him, he never met me, but he says that Mother has a lot of work, I will meet her from here itself and he lives in that satisfaction. Many different types of egos can be seen. For example, if someone is saying something to me, they will cut him off in the middle, I get surprised, that poor person was talking to me, why do you interrupt? These small things show that we have not yet drunk the nectar of the silent beauty of Sahaja Yoga, we have not entered into it, have not enjoyed it, you have to get into that nectar. Today's special purpose was that somehow with hard work, I should give you a dip, then further we will see. I will try to give it to all of you, but it also depends on your own state. Sometimes the Divine may want to fill water of the (holy) Ganga river into a stone, but it's rather difficult. It is similar in Sahaja yoga also, sometimes such people come in the front that one wonders how to awaken in their hearts the desire and bearing of the supremely beautiful eternal state (akshay pada). Pure desire has been awakened, Kundalini has been awakened, I bless you that may the aspiration for and thought of the supreme principle awaken in you by itself through understanding its value.

I was waiting to be invited. No one came. I said, have you forgotten to ask for the eternal state today? Or did you think that it is so difficult and we cannot get the eternal state, so better not invite Mother at all? For one hour I was ready and waiting, but no one came to invite, so I thought let's go by myself. It's the same thing, of feeding food. In a way it was good that I got late, that you must have prepared your heart to get this eternal state, this great state, many desired for this supreme state.

[English part]

There are some foreigners, so I will just explain to you. Today is the day where, whatever you want to know of eternal nature, you can ask Me and will last for eternity.

But many people think that today is the day when, whatever you ask, God has to give you. It’s true, whatever you ask, you’ll get it. But it’s just a temptation. Beyond that is eternity.

So, whatever you have to ask, you should ask for something that is eternal, indestructible.

That higher state which is called the permanent state of joy and bliss is to be asked today because all other askings are wasted and you again go back to the position where you were. It’s important to understand that this time, today, you have to ask something eternal for yourself, something eternal for your family, something eternal for your country and something eternal for this world and universe.

You all are Sahaja Yogis and of a very high level and I’m happy that all of you have come here for that eternal state of your being.

And if it works out, you should get that eternal state within yourself. You should get that state where you don’t want anything anymore and reside in that beautiful condition of complete peace and bliss. That’s what is available to you and you can easily achieve it.

I cannot say this to people who are not Sahaja Yogis. But I can definitely say this to people who are Sahaja Yogis and who have achieved already Self-realization.

So, today, I hope you, all of you will pray and ask for that eternal love of God. Which should flow through you all the time.

May God bless you all
