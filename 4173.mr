[Hindi to English translation]

Doctor sahab gave Me a pill to sleep and I slept off. But, you all were singing songs here, I thought some people who did not get the chance to sing, also got the chance. Everything is going on well. But, when the whole world sleeps, then a Sahaja Yogi is awake, and when the world is awake a Sahaja Yogi sleeps. It means that the things towards which Sahaja Yogis are inclined, other people are not inclined towards them. They are inclined towards other things. In some way or the other, they face away from the truth. Meaning, some are caught up with money, some are caught up with power. Human beings get caught up with one or the other hassle, and get completely lost. They get away from the truth, their attention does not go towards truth. Some will say this is the reason or that is the reason, some or other analysis they will do.

However I think, it is ignorance. In ignorance, people do all kinds of things. A sort of darkness, dense darkness falls on them. For example, if this place is plunged into darkness, there might be a stampede. Some may get up and start running, then many people might get knocked down, get trampled over, get hurt, anything can happen. When we are in this darkness, then we are in a state of sleep. But when you are awakened, when your Kundalini is awakened and when you are confronted with the truth, then nobody can describe the glory of that truth. I asked somebody: "What did you get in Sahaja Yoga?". He said, "Mother, I can’t tell you what, but I got everything". What does "everything" mean?

I will also say that today, I got everything in Sahaja. When I was a child, I used to tell My father that it is My desire, that like the stars in the sky, many people on earth should also shine like stars, and spread the light of God. He said, "It is possible. You find a method for en-masse awakening; don’t give lectures, don’t write anything, or else another Bible or another Quran will come up, and that will become another reason to fight about. So, first of all, You do en-masse awakening". And the task of en-masse awakening started, spontaneously, in a Sahaj way. But, the problems associated with it, I have to tell you today. It is a great pleasure that en-masse awakening happened and everywhere, in every country, in such great numbers, people have taken to the truth and are in its' bliss. But it hurts to think, that for en-masse Realization, we have not been selective. We opened the door for all sorts of people to enter and they brought their dirt along with them.

When even a few such people come, they cause a lot of damage. Great saints like Namadeva who have been among us only, had said very clearly that those who are bad can never become good. Their habits can never be corrected. He said, for example, take a fly. If a fly sits on your food, it will make you sick, and if it dies and you eat it, you will die too. The fly cannot become good, and there are a lot of people like this fly, who are very fond of jaggery and they keep running towards it. So, in Sahaja Yoga all such things should drop off. We cannot ascend higher, until they drop off. If something gets stuck to the wings of a bird, then it cannot fly. That is why this sky of bliss which poets have called “Raganchal” - the sky of Mother’s love - in this sky, you cannot fly like a bird because something is still stuck to your wings.

Today is a very auspicious day, and many people think of it as a great day, and on this day, something special happened. Many people have mentioned this. But today, you all have to do something very special. You have decorated this place with so many balloons. One becomes happy to see them and thinks, that even rubber has so much power to give us joy and happiness, and that also can become a beautiful thing. We are human beings and on top of that we are Sahaja Yogis now. We are great people. So, what should be done to raise everyone to a certain level? Recently, I had an experience, which I am going to tell you as a story, that had hurt Me a lot. I am telling this in Hindi because this shortcoming exists mainly in Indians.

It is not common in foreigners and foreign countries. They don't have much understanding about it. Earlier, in our country, within our whole Mother India, many kind of nations were integrated. You know Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc., many nations were a part of it. This is our mother - Bharat Mata. But people divided it. Why did they do it? The reason is that, for example, there were some people in this country, who thought, "That person became our country leader. He got great authority, so why should not I do something so that I also get that authority. If he can become Prime Minister, then I can also become Prime Minister".

Jealousy, first thing. They became jealous and thought, "If we have a separate country, if we divide the country, we will get a share of it and we can rule it". Similar situation happens in big families as well, that people want their own house and want to stay separately, with their family and children and have no connection with others. So, division became a nature of human beings. Because of this reason, Bangladesh was formed. I was quite surprised that people demanded for Bangladesh so strongly, because some people wanted to rule a country. Now, in the name of Islam or any other religion, with some or other excuse, the partition was done. And today Bangladesh is in such a state that people say, "Mother, you don't go there, else tears will keep rolling down your eyes continouusly. It is that bad". What is the condition of Pakistan?

Ceylon, which is now called Sri Lanka, what happened to it? By breaking the country into pieces, they thought that they will rule it. Most of the prime ministers of these places, who somehow managed to create a new country, were killed. They were murdered. So, jealousy increases jealousy. And then such groups get formed and then they fight... Even now the idea of division prevails in our country. Like we have Vidarbha here, Jharkhand is there, Bharkahand is there. What is one going to achieve by this division? What has anyone achieved so far by partition?

Sahaja Yoga is totally against the partition of anything. We want to unite everyone, synthesis. Synthesis is the principle of Sahaja Yoga. If you do not accept the idea of synthesis, then it is better that you leave Sahaja Yoga. Recently, a very big incident took place, when a gentleman came to Sahaja Yoga. He used to remove bhoots from everyone. I told him, "Stop this or bhoots will catch you". But, it became his hobby. Maybe the people used to pay him, or appreciate him, whatever... So he started a group of his own.

Such people from Sahaja Yoga also joined him. They all formed a separate group and made a separate institution. Yes, regarding Me they had no doubts. But, regarding leaders they said, "They are useless". They found faults with everyone, with one person or another and said, "We are leaders of pure conduct, and we are Mother's devotees". Without asking Me, without My permission, without telling Me, they made their own group, they used My photo and what not. I had no idea what was happening. [UNCLEAR]. Pointing out leaders that, "This leader is not good, that leader is not good"... If somebody is bad then I will know it Myself.

When you believe in Me, you should leave things to Me. Let Me decide if a leader is good or not. But. to say, "Why did the leader do this? ", "Why is he like that?" - you do not have the authority to say that. Now someone will ask, "Why are there leaders in Sahaja Yoga?". It is because it is not possible for Me to associate with everyone, so if there is a person in between, then I can associate with everyone through him. So, they got angry with the leaders, "This leader is not good. He is like this or he is not like this".

If there is something wrong with the leaders, I should correct it, not you. What you should do is to write to Me. But, if you tell such people, "If you don't like the leader, you can leave Sahaja Yoga", then 10 more half-baked Sahaja Yogis will join them. And then they will start talking ill about that leader. In the same manner, a group was formed and about 70-80 people joined them, whom I had never seen or heard of before, and didn't know if they are Sahaja Yogis or not. Then that person said, ”I am the incarnation of Kalki”. Alright, if you are that, so be it. I have nothing to say. But, get out of Sahaja Yoga. There is no place for you in Sahaja Yoga.

These people believed that he was the incarnation of Kalki and started touching his feet and all that. There have been "maharajas" who get their feet touched and grab money. All sorts of "maharajas" are there and they became one of them. He took lot of money from them. Gradually, all the faults they were pointing out in the leaders, the same faults were present in them, all these faults got nicely exposed, and everybody started wondering what was going on. So this sort of jealousy and ambition manifest. But, all the fools in Sahaja Yoga got filtered out and joined that group. Really amazing. Since it is the Last Judgement, all such Sahaja Yogis get filtered and join together. They comment about the leaders, that their character is not right, that they misappropriate money, they are like this, like that - these people investigate more than CBI.

I am amazed that they crossed all the limits. At least consult Me. At least accept the certificate I give. You say, "We believe in You", but you don't believe in what I am doing, Then these stupid people reached Ganapatipule, and there they started throwing stones at Me, because when one’s mind gets corrupt, when one loses wisdom, one is not aware of what one is doing or saying - one behaves like a person who is drunk. And there they created a scene. They even came to the program. I felt such bad vibrations from them. I thought, "Oh my God, are these people going to be in Sahaja Yoga"? Instead of correcting their vibrations, they were correcting other people’s vibrations. So, this kind of people who are in Sahaja Yoga, should leave Sahaja Yoga, because this is not Sahaja Yoga.

But, if one or two of that kind come up, many people follow him, thinking he will lead them to heaven. This is not so. Sahaja Yoga is a collective movement. It is a collective institution. In this, if one’s ear is here, nose is there, hand is elsewhere - it’s just not going to work out that way, because the Chaitanya does not like it. Then I said, “You are rebelling!”. Then they replied, “Are You abusing us?”. I said, “No, I am advising you not to rebel against the Chaitanya”. This is why there was an earthquake there. Who knows what else is going to happen?

As a Mother, I told them that the Truth and God will not spare them. I am a Mother, it is different with Me, but they (God & Truth) will not spare you, so please leave all this. But as the saying goes, "Old habits die hard", that's the case here. They are still doing it. Now, I heard in Dehradun they are doing this in full force. On one side, there is Jharkhand, and on the other, they are creating "bhoot-khand" (land of bhoots). Now, if these 4-5 bad people are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, then there are many people who will join them, and they will form a new group. But, I am least bothered about that group, they can very well go and drown themselves in river Ganges, I don't care. But, they cannot be in Sahaja Yoga. And they can't use either My name or My photo.

Today, I felt very sad when I heard, that the person whom I trust so much, who has done so much work, was being questioned, "How did you get that car?". Oh ho! He is working and has a business. Anyhow, I should be the one to ask. And still if you have any such "special" complaint, write to Me. I didn't want to say this today, but as there is no other time, I had to say these inauspicious things on this auspicious day. If you want to do this kind of business, then you can go out of Sahaja Yoga right now. I have no objection in that. In Sahaja Yoga there is no compulsion. I have never even forced My family to join Sahaja Yoga, although I know that there is nothing greater than this.

But I have never asked them to do Sahaja Yoga. If you want to do it, then do it, otherwise don't do, but you should not do this kind of things. That means you can never be a Sahaja Yogi. In a way, from a Sahaja Yoga point of view, to behave like this towards your leaders is a great sin and to form groups on this basis is even a greater sin. If you want, you can write to Me. I will check. In fact I can immediately know through vibrations, whether you are right or they are. They write all kind of things in their letters. Even when they write, they write such nonsensical things that I don’t feel like bothering. "This leader is like this, that one is like that".

Are you yourself a very great soul? Look at yourself! You should see yourself. If you yourself are not alright, then what will happen in the future? You have children, and besides the children, all the neighbours who live around you, what will they think? If your leader is "like this" won't they think, "Doesn't your Mother have some sense, that She selects these kinds of leaders?". This kind of problems start and then Sahaja Yoga finishes there. Till now it has not finished anywhere like this. I have always tried my best to save all those who are drowning. It's better if they are saved somehow, and have more Sahaja Yogis.

But I also feel that this Heaven is based on truth, so to go to this Heaven some preparations are necessary. If not, then there might be a shortage of space there, so, nature might be also trying to push these useless people out. But you should not get into such affairs. If you are really aware, then be aware of yourself, not about others, be aware of your own self and see your shortcomings. Some people have some other affairs, like money affair. Some people come to Sahaja Yoga to earn money. If you tell them that you are not here to earn money, it doesn't enter their brains. I will also have to tell you today, that in money matters, some people have very little brain. Christ had said, "First will be the last and last will be the first", but it doesn't seem like that. In the beginning, Sahaja Yogis who came to Bombay, said, "Mother at least take thousand rupees from each one of us".

I said, "Children, I neither know how to count money or how to keep it, nor I know anything about banking. But, if we can form something like what we call a trust, then I will deposit your money in that". Not because I want to show that I am very honest - it's not the case - I do not know how to be dishonest, so what can be done? If I don’t know how to count money, what should I do? I don’t even know how to write a cheque. Leave it! I am differently made. But, you people know everything that if anyone takes money in the name of religion he will regret. The money trap is very powerful. So, this time I thought and told you many times, that there are women here begging on the streets, a lot of Muslim women, who have been abandoned by their husbands, who beg on the roads with their children, and also lot of women have come from Bihar and Rajasthan.

We should do some good for them, so we formed an organisation. For this I don’t need any money from you people. We have never asked anyone for any money. It all gets arranged somehow. But, I thought that you should also receive some blessings, so I said, "Donate 500 Rs instead of 108 Rs". Finished! I got letters after letters - "You increased it from 108 to 500?". What is it if you just have to pay it once a year? Do you not want to do any good deeds, but only want to gain? Then how will your Lakshmi tatwa be seen?

In Lakshmi tatwa you have only to give. So much fuss was made for 500 rupees! Five hundred rupees you give sometimes for just a hair cut. So much chaos was made for that 500 Rs, then I understood people are still half baked. This was not so in olden days, devotion and sacrifice were there. And they didn't even feel that they were sacrificing. They enjoied it. So, the thing is that our attention is still on money. "We will pay only 108 Rs, or we will not come at all". Better don't come, get out of Sahaja Yoga permanently.

That is better. Because Sahaja Yoga is not for beggars. First of all you become alright and then help the beggars. We can help beggars. For that, if little amount is being asked, then why are you getting so angry? You know I neither touch that money, nor I know anything about. But, if for a good cause, instead of 108 Rs, 500 Rs is being asked, then you fight with all the leaders, fight with everyone, and create problems saying, "Mother, who suggested this to you?". The person who can suggest Me is not yet born. I go according to My will. This is what you should understand.

I may look simple from outside, but actually I am very clever from inside! So you should not try to befool Me. And you people cannot even give this much for Sahaja Yoga? For so many years I cured thousands of people, gave so much money as tips and did so much for you, you know that, but even for such a small thing, people turned their back! I felt very sad. Earlier also such a thing has happened, such a low level thinking. Now, in Bombay, people said "Mother, do the Puja here, this time". I said, "I had a very bad experience here last time". When the Puja took place, only a quarter of the people paid for the food, rest I had to pay. You did Puja to Me and I paid for your food.

People of Bombay, particularly Maharashtrians are very miserly. They will give to brahmins, they will give to Siddhi Vinayak, but here they came running for free food. A quarter of them paid for their food, and one-third paid for the Puja - eleven rupees, just eleven. And they came to Sahaja Yoga. Instead, they can take a bowl and sit outside a mosque - that would be better. Allah may do something good for them. This kind of people are there in Sahaja Yoga. That is why I want to tell you that till now I didn't need any kind of donation from you all. But, I thought, "Let Me see, let Me test you". And that testing amazed Me.

And there is no one so poor here who can't pay even 500 Rs. And so it was told, that whoever can't give needs not give. I got call after call saying, "Please cut my name, I can't pay". "Why? ", "Because my husband only earns". "How much does he earn? ", "7000 Rs. But, I can't pay. My husband will pay only for him. As if we should put it on sale like it is done in marketing.

"Better if there is some sale. Can You excuse us from paying?". What is there to excuse? How much money am I going to get? Will it run My NGO? Not at all. But, your test is done, about how much deep you are. So, to take the attention away from money, is very important especially for Indians if they are in Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise "jail bharo andolan" (a kind of protest) is going on here. Why is your attention so much on money, when I have awakened your Lakshmi tattwa?.

As much as you give, so much you will receive. "To give" is so joyful that there is no limit to it. When you give Me something, I only take it to make you feel happy. I don’t need anything. There is no place in My house to keep anything. I can't do anything because you give it with so much love, it makes you happy. I am tired of telling you people, "Don't give Me sarees", "I don't need anything. I don't need any jewellery". I even said I am going to sell all the jewellery; everything will be done by that. They said, "Mother, whatever You do, we'll give You (gifts) anyway".

I am doing it for your joy. For Me what is give and take? When I have not taken anything, then what is there to give? So, this is something, we Indians must learn. I have met such people - you will be surprised! Just to get independence of our country, My father sold all the land and properties, My mother sold all our jewellery and we all went to jail. They gave Me electric shocks and made Me lie on ice. Nothing happened to Me. It was a joke. But still people tolerated all kinds of things, and went to jail for 2-3 years.

People are still going to jail, there is no doubt, but that’s because they are corrupt. They claim, "See, we also went to jail". Those people who have misbehaved in Sahaja Yoga are going to be expelled by Me for sure. And be warned: if anyone dares to raise the voice against any leader, then I will turn him out of Sahaja Yoga. Understand this completely without a doubt, because we do not have to divide. If you are selfish, mean and you don’t have any job, then join the police, or become CID (Crime investigation department) or do anything. Why have you come to Sahaja Yoga? When you are not worthy of it, why did you come? I have been too bold to talk about such things to you on such a day. When I went to sleep then only it came to Me, "What should I say today?

I am 74 years old. If one is old what one should say?". So, old people have also one job: to guide their children. They have to tell them too, what life is all about, and why they have to come to Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga you have not come to destroy yourself; because the path of Sahaja Yoga is extremely narrow. If you have to come to Sahaj you should know that you have to tread on this narrow path, on one side of which is a mountain and on the other a abyss. So, to walk on this path if you don't have that strength, that stregth of your heart, that determination, if you don't have that pure desire, then it won't work out and you will be stuck somewhere in between. On the mountains you might have seen people going up on donkeys. The donkeys were asked, "How did you become donkeys?". They replied, "We were also like you, but, since we were half baked God made us donkeys, so that at least in this form we can make it to the top".

These stories you have heard, read. Our country has abundance of them. Regarding this subject there are so many stories. Most of them were written to teach us, to make us understand what happens when we choose the wrong path. Several stories are there and among them, those stories which teach us a lesson, those are the real ones. Again and again, I am feeling that today I should have told something nice, but this topic got highlighted as a big concern on Shri Shiva Puja, that I thought now if I don't talk about it, how will it work out. And on Shri Shiva's Puja you cannot say anything because He only knows to forgive, but that too, to some extent. But, when He gets angry, you know what He does. I fear Him the most. Because if He gets angry, then He will finish you.

The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga was free for you, in a way, because your previous births were great. You have got it because of the wealth of good deeds accumulated in your previous lives. However, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga and getting everything, if you are going to be of no use, then better leave it, and spare Me also. I said this today after thinking a lot about it, although I do not think much, I am generally in Nirvichara, but still I am worried because I consider you all My sons and My daughters. So if you keep falling because of your faults, I cannot bear it. It hurts Me a lot. In Sahaja Yoga there is everything: bliss, peace... All your problems disappear in a snap of the fingers. You know it, you have experienced it, I don’t have to explicitly tell you about it.

[English transcript]

That was for Indians not for you people. And I have to tell you thank you very much for this celebration, for all these beautiful balloons.

But, looking at these balloons, we have to also see some of them who have lost their air completely. This is another problem we face in the West because to have ego itself, according to the Western culture, is a very great achievement. And when we start living with our ego I know how one looks like. He really looks like a stupid fellow. When he talks, when he describes himself, you don't know where to look because just feel like laughing at his stupidity. Ego is the outcome of stupidity. I don't know what to say; how to give a simile to ego, because it's just bloated and makes you float in the air, and when it bursts you are down on the earth. But you are not down on the earth the way Sahaja Yogis should be down to earth; but you are completely finished. All your arrogance goes to waste. You can never understand Sahaja Yoga if you have this ego in your head.

I have known people who have this ego. They have come to Sahaja Yoga and still they want to think that they know more than anybody else. To know about yourself you have to go deep down, and to go deep down you have to give up all this idea which makes you float in the air. Imagine if you have a big balloon attached to you. How can you go deep down into the sea? You cannot. That kind of a air which makes you float in the air, absolutely in an area of stupidity, what else -I mean English you will think there are no words- stupidity means everything. Then you may think no end of yourself. You may think whatever you like, you can behave the way you like and all that but what do you achieve? You achieve nothing out of it.

Whatever you achieve people are jealous of you. They want to harm you. You have no friends. Nobody cares for you, and in Sahaja Yoga people know who has got this problem. So, I've seen people when they start talking they say, “Ah! We know, we know him.” Once I had an experience, long, long time back in Pune where the people who were owning that wada said that we cannot have Shri Mataji's program because She is not a Brahmin. So the Sahaja Yogis said, all right we'll give it in the newspaper because She is not a Brahmin we cannot have a program. So, these people came to My program and the owner of that was sitting on the gallery on top. He couldn't even walk. He was suffering from some sort of a funny disease.

So these people suddenly start. I didn't know. They didn't tell Me anything. They didn't tell Me that these people have protested or whatever it is. So they all started shaking like this, like this, like this. I said, “What is this?” So I said, “What is it?” They said “Mother, stop it. We know You are Shakti but stop it. It's too much, too much.” “But what did you do?” They said, “We didn't do anything. We just said this is a Brahmin's thing and a Brahmin's wada, and this area is mostly resided by Brahmins, so we thought that You cannot have your program.” I said, “Really, that's all ?” “Yes, yes, that's all. But it's, you see on the other side, you see those people?

They are also shaking with Your power.” So I asked them, “Who are you? Are you also Brahmins ?” They said, "No, no. We are certified mad people from Thana.” “And how are you here?” They said, “There was one fellow who was mad was cured by You.” “Really?” “So our superintendent is here. He has brought us here. We are certified mad. Certified.” My goodness, these people looked at Me. I said, “See now, you tally. You are shaking and they are shaking. Now you tally. Where are you?” And they all became Sahaja Yogis.

Not only that but the gentleman sitting upstairs I told him, "You get up and come down." He came and since that day he has surrendered his life and did a lot of work in Pune. So what I'm saying that anybody who talks like that; that “This is wrong, in Sahaja Yoga, this should not happen, we should not have paid so much, or this leader is not good”; should take a paper, thin paper, on his hand, and put it before the photograph. If you can stop the shaking then you are all right. All of you can try this. Then try on the right hand. Very practical. If the paper is shaking that means Mr. Ego is shaking, and you know how to treat your ego in Sahaja Yoga, thanks to Mohammed Sahib. He has told us how to treat it. Now these two problems are within us.

One of them is our conditioning and another is this ego business, and we make our mind out of that and we are playing under the governance of these two things which we have used to make this mind. Now you have to be careful. You find out with left hand. Now let's see. If the left hand is shaking then you are conditioned. If the right hand is shaking then you are egoistical. So now you treat it. You treat these two things. Before Me you'll get vibrations all right because you see I am your Mother. All right.

But that doesn't mean you are all right. You try on My photograph; that's much more sharp. So being Mother you know I play around. I think, I don't know what I should say, but maybe you may not feel that way. But before the photograph you put on the left hand side a newspaper or a little paper or a thin paper. On the right hand side another paper. One by one you try and judge yourself, what are you? After all you have not come here in Sahaja Yoga to emancipate Me. You have come here to evolve yourself and because of that you have to face yourself and see for yourself what is within you which is very strong, which is troublesome, which is dragging you down, which is killing. Sahaja Yoga is nothing but Ocean of Joy.

I thought that in My absence you'll be all enjoying it all right; you do. Airport I have seen sometimes I am late because of the plane, about four hours, five hours, and everybody is so fresh, and so nice early in the morning. I said, “What's happened ?” “The whole night we have been enjoying Mother.” So what you enjoy in that is collectivity: Sangat That collectivity you should enjoy only by getting rid of your nonsensical boundaries that you have built, and then you see the joy. All the time you'll be floating in joy. There is a sense which people have which you may not have before realization. Some of the people, I was amazed how deep they are, how they took to Sahaja Yoga. Supposed to be very great men. Supposed to be people of very great principles but very hot-tempered, intolerant about people, and they take to Sahaja Yoga just like this because inside there's a big depth, so that everything is absorbed without any problem. Everybody can achieve but one has to be careful as to the two wheels of our mind. One is the ego, another is the conditioning.

All kinds of conditionings are there, especially in India. In the West it is all kinds of egos you know, different, different types. I have seen so many types and varieties of egos, I was surprised; to face that. I didn't know what to say. It's a very, very subtle thing which people have carved out of their minds. So for you today it is to be decided that you are only still small children, and like small children you must have a very clean heart to accept, to absorb the beauty of peace that is within you; and also the beauty of purity. Without purity you cannot enjoy anything. So in Sahaja Yoga though we have so many people I must say the purity of these few saints, who lived earlier, we have to yet achieve. For example, yesterday they were singing about Ali. I was so very happy because He was an Incarnation.

And His purity people are singing now; not at that time. He was killed at that time, He was tortured. That always they do. Then we have many others. We have here Dam Dam Sahib. See what a great thing to come to. We have here Nizamuddin Auliya. We have so many people in our country itself that nobody, no other country can claim. They have one, say in England they have William Blake or this and that. We had so many people.

Why? Not because we were very good people, but because we were to be improved. Things had to be done. So they were born. Though this is a Yoga Bhoomi anywhere you go in India, I was surprised, in Haryana so many great saints lived there. But they were all tortured, troubled, never understood. It was so painful and hurts you how this stupid, ignorant, blind people tortured them. So now it is our duty of Sahaja Yogis to, first of all, find out who is a saint. Even among Sahaja Yogis, as I described in Hindi language, there are people who try to trouble, trouble others. If you have no recognition and understanding of what is the truth, what is love, what is pure compassion, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

It's like an obtuse angle you see, you have. You look at a person with an obtuse angle you don't see anything, one-sided. Now, at this juncture when I am so very old now; I have to request that you turn your eyes to yourself. Introspect. Because among you there are some people who will try to divert your attention, will try to say things. Very easy to say, “He is very dishonest, he is very immoral”; very easy to say. What are you? We have to now understand that Sahaja Yoga is to be consolidated through synthesis. We are believers of synthesis. Any divisive thing that comes into your mind you should just throw it away.

This is a request on this day I make you - that you please introspect. Unless and until you introspect you cannot even respect yourself. You cannot even love yourself. If you love yourself you will introspect and find out what's wrong. Supposing I love this sari, then if I find any doubt about it or see any dot somewhere or something I'll get it cleaned. I'll not be proud of it, wear it and go round saying, “Ah! See I've got so many spots.” In the same way, you should be not proud of whatever asahaj temperaments you have within yourself. And don't talk like that. Christ has called them 'murmuring souls'. He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls”.

I would say: "Throw away all the murmuring souls". That's the only way. In Hindi as they say 'bakwas’; their name is bakwas; means the ones who just chatter, chatter, chatter; talk all nonsense about others. He doesn't know what he is. It is much more in India, I must confess. I'm sorry, though I'm an Indian. It is a habit of talking ill of others, sitting down just chit-chatting. They will not talk of Sahaja Yoga. How many people know Sahaja Yoga in the proper way? I mean if I have to give degrees, what degrees I should give to you?

Tell Me. You don't know even about your vibrations. Of course you are Sahaja Yogis because you have fallen into this trap of achieving evolution. But how many are really grown up into it? You can. So I have to again and again tell you, to make Me happy, you have to give up all these nonsensical, cheapish talks; but try to understand from each other what we know of Sahaja Yoga. Discuss it and contribute to this knowledge by describing your experiences of Sahaja Yoga. There are many who do it. I am not saying they don't do. But even there's one bad fellow he can spoil all of them; like one bad apple can spoil all the apples.

So what do we do -throw away the apple out of the basket. It is important see, even I feel all this, standing like a witness to you, silent witness. When I see big, big mountains, and I think they are like great saints who are watching, and they are trying to record what is happening in this world because they also understand. They also know. I have to again, and again, tell you that today is the day to see your own self, your own chakras, your own - I should say - defects. That will give you permanently the joy that is promised. You will get thoughtless awareness. Also you'll get doubtless awareness. But never get into the trap of your conditioning and of your ego. This is what I have to tell you today, on this day where you are celebrating, that you celebrate your own birthday.

Celebrate it. See for yourself what you have achieved and what you are going to achieve. It's time for you to celebrate than to celebrate My birthday. I'll be very happy to celebrate your birthday than to celebrate Mine. So may God bless you.
