Eve of Birthday Puja. Sydney (Australia), 20 March 1990.

So My tour of Australia has come to an end. 
Today is a day I can say it’s all very well done. We have had very good response; I didn’t expect that much everywhere. It was tremendous and very great things have happened, some miracles also, during this visit. And one has to know that Sahaja yogis have to be with great potential manifesting. If they are, then it triggers very well; otherwise I cannot work out. For that we have to understand that in Sahaja Yoga there’s no sacrifice of any kind. Don’t have to sacrifice anything, it’s all the time blessings throughout. You don’t have to sacrifice anything, and you don’t have to suffer also anything – nothing of the kind. 


I have told you about how My father was in jail, My mother was in jail and how many times, and how we suffered during the war of independence. We lost everything, all our properties, everything, for the war of independence only. But this is the independence, the freedom of an absolute nature: not only for you but for the whole world, for your children, for everyone. It’s a tremendous work. It’s a very great achievement. In the history of spirituality, in the history of the world this is the greatest thing that has happened, is that people are transformed into a new awareness. Perhaps you are not aware of it. And we take it for granted, we don’t understand the importance of it; and we get lost into smaller, smaller things and very wasteful things which are of no value. How are these things will be going into the history, you must understand that. And where do you stand in that history? What will you be called? 


So now first of all there were problems with the leaders. All right. But there were some who stuck on to it. They didn’t give it up. They did not give it up because the leaders were bad. Nobody wrote to Me, all right, but they stuck on. But those who went away, why didn’t they write to Me why they went away? This is an escape from reality. This is an escape, to say that there was something wrong with the the ashram people, there was something wrong with the leaders – of course, it was. But you should have written to Me – why didn’t you write to Me? Why did you take such decisions on your own, and just left the Sahaja Yoga into lurch? We have to be people of quality, otherwise Sahaja Yoga won’t work out. It’s not meant for people who are mediocres. If there are few, doesn’t matter; but there have to be people of quality, that is one thing for sure.


Now I have seen that everywhere people have taken here a view that it’s better to have separate houses. I mean, this is another absurd view: from where it has come into your heads, I don’t know. Absolutely absurd, against Sahaj, it’s most asahaj view. 


Today only I was reading, five old ladies were killed by one man, because they were living alone in every house. Such violence, such horrible atmosphere everywhere. Even for security it’s better that you live together, at least eight people, ten people together. There’s no sacrifice in it, there’s no sacrifice. On the contrary if you live together as I’ve told you, you save money, your children are looked after; if somebody’s pregnant she’s looked after, there’s somebody to look after you. But what is the gain of having another house, I don’t understand. You have to work much harder, pay much more, but a kind of a ego satisfaction is there. And then they develop problems, I have seen: we’ve got cancer, we’ve got heart attacks, we’ve got this, “my son has run away”, that has happened, that has happened. All this arbitrary behavior, and I am supposed to be sort of responsible for everything. It’s a complete liability, once somebody comes to Sahaja Yoga, then he is a liability on us. But he has no responsibilities and he has no duties – only I have. That’s not proper.


So now I have to tell you today very frankly that you all have to live together, at least eight to ten people in a place. And don’t fight, and don’t create groups. Group-making is a very wrong thing. Before making any group you write to Me. You are all welcome to write to Me, and I’ll attend to that letter if it is worth attending, because I know everything through vibrations. Don’t talk against each other. It’s a murmuring souls, and Christ has said such people will go to hell. It’s not hell outside, I tell you, it will be the hell here. It’s hell here. I have seen people suffering. I have been so frightened, you have no idea. Don’t play about with Sahaja Yoga at all. I’m just warning you, it’s a very serious thing. People have got heart attacks, have got accidents, have got cancers, all kinds of things, and really I am quite frightened that you people don’t realize that there is another force working it out. Don’t take arbitrary decisions. You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga. Stay in Sahaja Yoga, grow in Sahaja Yog, enjoy in Sahaja Yog. Everything is there available for you. 


And you don’t have to do anything else except that keep together: it’s a collective happening. It’s a collective. If you are not in the collective, the Divine is not interested in you at all – you are out of it. Only the collective gets the power, only the collective is magnetic. Single person who lives away from collective all the time, is something wrong with that person. If you cannot be collective, there’s something wrong. Such a person should sit down and find out what’s wrong with that person, must get it corrected, absolutely corrected. And see to it that you are all right; because this is for your benevolence. You want to lead a happy, healthy, good life, then be sensible, have some wisdom about it. And so some people who have been negative are still negative, and just thinking on the same lines.


So it’s high time all of you have to work it out sensibly, and understanding. There are leaders because I have to have communication, that’s all. And they will communicate to Me about you people. If there are problems, they will try to solve you. If they cannot solve it, they’ll write to Me and I’ll have to see to it. There’s not going to be any regimentation in Sahaja Yoga at all; it is a thing of love. But you must have love for yourself. I mean, you should be self-disciplined. Now imagine how I must have felt: I have come here, I’ve worked so hard for so many times I have been here, and when I come here what I find, everything is broken down. It’s so sad – I’ve worked so hard.


But next time I am going to see you all settled down in proper ashrams, in different place. Not for your own comfort you should think, but if you have an ashram you put a center there. Every place you can have a center. In Bombay, I don’t know, we have eighteen or twenty-one centers, in Bombay. That’s how it increases, and improves it. You have centers everywhere, so it’s available to people all the time. You would talk about it, meet every day, evening time you all can meet, talk to each other; and you have one day in a week somewhere, in a school or something, big place where you all meet. The more you meet, the more there is rapport, the more there is collectivity, the more there are blessings for each one of you, and for all of you. It absolutely simultaneously works out; whilst when there is no collectivity – no. When there is collectivity, everything works out. Everything is available to you. So don’t try to break the collectivity by forming any groups or anything – nothing of the kind. If you find anything wrong you have to write to Me. But it’s everybody’s responsibility is to sustain the collectivity, to support it, to help it.


If you find that somebody is talking about somebody else, then you say, “No, no, he was talking very good about you. Why are you talking ill about that person?” This is what, this is what Christ has said, that these are peacemakers. But somebody says something about someone – oh, then you go into, “Ho, ho, ho, that one is like this,” then another one. We are not like common people, we are not ordinary people, we are saints. We are to respect each other, to love each other, to understand and enjoy each other. What will the children say tomorrow? So nobody should get away with this idea that we can have separate houses, live separately and we are all right. Better take out all My photographs from them; they have no business. At least eight persons should be there in one household, at least, minimum. Eight to ten people is a good idea. There’s no safety, there’s no progress, there’s nothing in such houses where they live alone very nicely. Morning till evening they are cooking, cleaning, sweeping, swabbing, looking after the car, locking the house – what else are they doing? It’s so boring to be alone, it’s extremely boring. 


Now I have already told you very clearly that we have to live together. And let the children know each other, know everyone, they should know about their friendship. And you know, it is so nice the way they love each other and the way they talk to each other, and about their aunties and uncles they talk so sweetly. So many aunties and uncles to have is something so remarkable; to have so many nephews and nieces all over. And unless and until you have that kind of a feeling, it won’t work out. Then if somebody finds something wrong with your child and tells you, don’t get angry for that – thank him. Try to improve your child. The improvement of your child is for the benevolence of the child. Not to feel bad: “this is my child.” This “my” business has to go a little bit; then I will come. If there is “my house”, “my children”, “my car”, “my” this, this has to go away.


Let us see how we start diverting our energies to a collective beauty, collective love, collective understanding. And if it is not, there’s something wrong with you, take it from Me, something wrong. So either you are right-sided or left-sided: find out and just get yourself cleared out. Treat it out yourself, and you will understand that there was something wrong with you, nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga. All such ideas are going to completely blast Sahaja Yoga and finish it off. They are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga.


You can have one room each other, for each one of them and you can stay together, and you can have somebody as a leader, whomsoever you want. If you want we can do rotation of leaders later on if you like that, can be done also. But still I would say that unless and until there is something wrong with the leader, it’s not proper to remove such a leader. But whatever you suggest, I don’t mind, but we have to have someone who is looking after you, and informing Me about it. But the wife of the leader is never a leader, understand that, it’s only the leader is the leader. Whether it’s the husband or a wife of a leader is not a leader, and she should never behave like that. She has to be very motherly, kindly, and all the time looking after all the people in a more gentler way than the husband himself. That’s the sign of a good wife of a leader. We have some, we have such women, and wherever there have been good ashrams, Sahaja Yoga has prospered. It has gone up to the governments, it has gone up to the intellectuals, it has gone up to such areas where we would never expect it, anywhere there has been. And most of the people now are in the ashrams, in the whole world. 


I hope you all understand the importance of it. Anything goes wrong with anyone here, immediately the telephone comes, that something has gone wrong with such and such person is sick. Then I can tell you what is to be done, how to get that person cured. But supposing you are in some other house …. It happened like this, one fellow was like that and he met with an accident. Met with an accident, nobody knew. He was lying in the hospital – when he came to his consciousness he called for somebody, then they told Me. It’s like one family, it’s like one body. If something hurts here, every – the whole body knows. You must know how many there are with us. You feel so strong and happy. But first of all you must develop that rapport, you must develop that love, must develop that personality. 


Now those who are left-sided, I’ve already told them what treatment they have to take, and take it seriously. Left-sidedness should not be allowed to grow at all – I tell you, it’s very dangerous. All these horrible diseases that you have heard of, all of them, one and all – say epilepsy, mental derangements, you can say cancer, all psychosomatic, this myelitis, then there are other diseases like AIDS, all that – attack only left-sided people. Anybody who has left side, immediately try to get rid of that left side. The right side shows so everybody knows, and you can throw away such a person, or you can correct it. But the left side be very careful, don’t play about with the left side. Left side is very dangerous. 


To avoid that, don’t mix up with people who are mentally deranged, don’t go to the hospitals where such people live, don’t try to cure people who are left-sided – they can be all cured on My photograph. And if somebody starts telling too much about their woes and all that, just shut your ears. All this left side comes from a kind of a self-indulgence, in the sense that you start thinking you are so miserable, you are so unhappy, you are no good, and all that. So the right-sided are over-confident, the left-sided are diffident. But they’re, because they’re diffident, you see, all kinds of viruses can attack. And these viruses are the thing which bring forth diseases which cannot be cured. So be careful on that point. 


The right-sided people trouble others. The left-sided trouble themselves, and the right-sided trouble others. They try to show off, they want to – just think they’re too much. First sign of a right-sided is that he starts suddenly shouting, or giving lectures also, that’s another one. Thirdly, he tries to show off that he’s a very big, great Sahaja yogi. There’s nobody great in Sahaja Yoga, everybody is just the same. Just like all fingers are the same, every cell is the same, everybody is the same. So nobody higher and lower, there’s no hierarchy in Sahaja Yoga. Everybody must understand that we are all one, part and parcel of one body, and we don’t have to consider ourself higher or lower. 


So there are so many ways of expression of these boastful, right-sided people. And we can pull their legs – all right, allowed! If somebody boasts too much you just pull their legs, that’s allowed. That’s how in India nobody can have ego, because from very childhood if somebody tries to show off, pull their legs. If somebody talks loudly, pull their legs. If somebody laughs loudly, pull their legs. I mean, anything somebody tries to do, overdo, just pull their legs. 


So it doesn’t behoove for a Sahaja yogi to be like that. Sahaja yogi has to be very dignified; otherwise why will people come to Sahaja Yoga, if we are just like them? We have to be exceptional, isn’t it? And that’s what is what I call dignified, loving, affectionate, kind, sweet – that’s what is the beauty. So anybody who shouts, screams, gets angry, full of anger, this thing, bring one pin and just prick it – allowed! And if he says anything, it’s to prick your ego. Show the pins, you see, like this. He’ll understand, “All right, this is what I have.” So when you make a fun of a person who is egoist he may not like it; but you show him a pin, he’ll understand, “Oh God, I have got it!” They are quite aware of their ego, they don’t want to have it.


There was a gentleman from Delhi, his son wrote to Me saying that “My father says that he’s not allowed to speak at all, and he’s feeling very sad about it.” So in the lecture I said that nobody is allowed to speak. After My tape, meditate, stay in that meditative mood, and go home. Not that just after meditation, “Oh, what cake I am going to have?” – all rush to the kitchen. So it’s surprising, even Indians are surprised at it. India, people don’t get so much to eat, but they are not hankering so much after food. Here the first attention is in the kitchen, all the time they are in the kitchen. How many times you take your tea is important. You should count how many times you are in the kitchen. I mean, you are still little babies, I tell you, in that respect. I don’t think I have ever opened a fridge to take out even water for Myself – I mean, since I remember My life, never. 


So this hankering after food is also another funny thing that is. After meditation people just get up and go to eat. You must sit down, meditate. Now after meditation if people start giving speeches, then the people are anxious to go to the kitchen, here’s somebody giving lectures, so big problem starts between the two. They don’t like it, because they think, “Oh, there’s a cake there, there’s something biryani kept, and here it is this gentleman is trying to give us a lecture.” No one likes it. But it should be something very different, that we are in meditative mood, how can we come out of it?


So I’d better tell you a story of Janaka, which is very important. He was the one, in the beginning at the time of Shri Rama, He was the father-in-law of Shri Rama, His name was Raja Janaka. And He was a king. So all the saints used to come and bow to Him. And He was a king, He used to live like a king. So one fellow, Nachiketa asked his guru, he said, “What is this, you bow to this Raja? He has got all the wealth, He has got everything, wears all the ornaments, He has all pomp and show. Why should you, a saint like you, go and bow to Him?” 


He said “He’s videhi. He’s so detached, He’s videhi. He doesn’t exist in His body.”


He couldn’t understand. He said, “All right, I’ll go and see Him.” So he went and told Him that “I want to become self-realized, as You are.”


He said, “You ask Me everything; I can give you, but no self-realization.”


“All right, we’ll see about it,” he said.


So one day they were having a bath. He said, “Let’s go to the river, we’ll have our bath.” So He took this boy, they were sitting and having the bath, when some people came and told that “Your palace is burning, and everybody is running away.” So He was still in meditative mood, He wouldn’t listen. 


Then they came back again, shouted, “See now, Your wife and children all are, have come out of it and they are all running away, because the whole thing is getting burned.” Still He was in meditative mood, least bothered.


Then they said, “Now the fire is coming this side, and what are You doing?” So Nachiketa got up and he caught hold of his clothes. He thought, “I should wear my clothes at least, they’ll be burnt.”


He was still meditating. Then Nachiketa realized that He is videhi. That’s why Sitaji is called as Vaidehi, because She is the daughter of a videhi. And that’s what we have to be. “Where is our attention?” we should say. You are meditating, take it deep down into yourself. That’s a meditative mood. Keep yourself there. And after meditation you just get up silently, sit for a while. I think best thing will be to have your food first and then meditate, if that is so, if you think that is proper.


But I think if you have to get now into that new triggering, as I told you, into that new jumping that we have to do in Sahaja Yoga: if you have to catch that train, then you hurry up. You have to change all these ideas. You have had many houses, you have had many wives and many children in your previous life. You never had your realization – now you have got it. So now just every individual, every one of you should not think of others, think of yourself, “I have to do it, I have to get it, I have to work it out.” This is what you have to do. “Why should I miss it?” This is a chance of many lives, the chance of many lives. And that’s how you can jump over, and work it out. 


We had lots of people in Australia, and if they had worried about themselves as to “what I have done for Sahaja Yoga.” So in the morning you just decide, what I am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself; in the evening, what have I done for myself, and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga? “Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but “for my ascent.” Every day. You start a diary to write it down. You face yourself. No excuses, nothing. If you are left behind, what we can do? We can’t help it. And that is how you’ll find all kinds of blessings will come to you. You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be able to save time, you’ll get good jobs. All your problems can be solved if you really surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya. Everything can be done. But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness and these narrow ideas about yourself, till then it won’t work out. This drop has to become one with the ocean, then ocean takes over. And I am sure that can work out.


And you are basically a very good point here, because you are born on the land of Shri Ganesha. Basically it’s such an advantage for you, much more than Russians have. But Russians, I don’t know how, they have shot up so well. It’s an Agnya, it’s a right Agnya where they have denied Christ, they have denied all religions, everything, and still they’re prospering. So you are very well placed. And innocence can never be lost, can never be lost, whatever you may try. Of course, there could be clouds, but they get just into nothing, they just disappear. If you just try to clean off your innocence and simplicity. And don’t think too much, “We should do like this, we should organize like this, we should have this thing” – nothing of the kind. Wherever you are, why to think? I never think, “Where I will sit? What will be My chair? How will I sleep? How will I go there?” Nothing. Just exist. Just exist. Everything works out for good, you should know. 


Now, if you redden too much on your faces, you should know you have left Vishuddhis. So first of all know that you are forgiven for everything. Whatever you have done you are forgiven, just remember. You are forgiven completely, absolutely hundred percent. There’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing to feel guilty. And you are loved, you’re looked after, you’re cared for. Paramchaitanya cares, it’s a caring, caring government, I should say. It cares for you, looks after you, it manages so many things. Unbelievable, it is. It manages, it works out.


You must have heard about the story about Cairns, what miracle has taken place, have you heard? No? So … Kay. Where is Kay? I was – Kay, can you tell them? Please come here. Just come. It’s too much!


[Kay: It was a great blessing for Shri Mataji to come to Cairns for us, and we had the opportunity of taking Shri Mataji out to the Great Barrier Reef.] 


Just we decided spontaneously.


[Kay: Very spontaneously! We delayed Her flight and kept Her from the Brisbane people for a  few hours, just to keep Her a little more time with us; but we thought it was important that She put Her attention on the reef, because there was a lot of problems happening with this great natural phenomena off the coast of Cairns. And we took a fast boat out to the reef, and Shri Mataji graciously agreed to go down into a semi-submersible and had a look at the reef. And just looking at it, all the fish came around. It was just a miracle to be in the reef with Her, while She was looking at all this wonderful natural phenomena. But within the next day the attention of the people who had been researching the reef and been worried about the Crown-of-Thorns starfish eating the reef, and all the pollution, suddenly they started to realize the reef was regenerating. And all the Crown-of-Thorns starfish were dying and they didn’t know why, they didn’t know where they’d come from, and now they don’t know where they’ve gone!] 


They have written, it’s a mystery!


[Kay: And they said it’s a mystery. But just a glance from our Mother has just made everything right. Jai Shri Mataji!]


But you are not a coral reef, you see, you are not that; because you see, I cannot, I cannot transform you that way. You have to use your will power. They are all animals, you see, and animals are under the control of God, that’s why they are called as “pashu”. This “pash” means all the bandhan. Under the bandhan of God: is whatever God wants can do with them, with the, all the plants, of animals, everyone. But with human beings you can’t do everything. And also to understand human beings is another problem. I don’t know how suddenly they become so funny. They are all right, going straight, and suddenly you don’t know what happens to them. So it’s a thing that God has created, and then adding to that, man has created himself a little bit more – which is quite a difficult thing to understand. So you better understand yourself, why you do like that; and you have to with your free will accept that “I have to do it.” It is self disciplining and you’ll work it out, and I’m sure one day you will show that in Australia we have really achieved a great height.


Children are wonderful here, no doubt. Then another thing is that we have started a school in India, with the idea that the amount you pay only for their food and clothes per month, that much is about to be charged for them. And they’ll have the best education of a private school, with all other facilities like horse-riding, swimming and every sort of thing. Music, dancing, everything can be taught to them. And the amount will be the same, practically as much as you’ll be spending on one child per month here, only for keeping them in the house. So it would be like going to a general school. Of course, the transport and everything we’ll look after. Now for this we have – as it is, you have paid some money, and others have also paid – and we have made a good arrangement now. The school has started.


With this kind of a school, the parents can go and see their children for a month, two months, whichever way you like, and stay there with them. Or if you want you can take them out to Himalayas, whichever way you want to do. But till the age of sixteen years I am thinking the children should not be exposed to this funny type of a country where they are just trying to destroy them, because we have tried that also. When the children go back to parents, they come back with great problems, so it’s difficult. 


So now to think “they are my children” – if you really think they are your children, for their benevolence you must sacrifice. Maybe a little money you might have to sacrifice, but more this feeling that “they are my children.” They’re actually Mine. And this will really help you a lot. You will be free here to do what you like, you have more time for meditation, spreading Sahaja Yoga – because we are now on sort of a warpath. And we have to make these children so good that wherever they go they will not take to drugs, they will not take to bad things. On the contrary, they’ll be very great Sahaja yogis. Maybe we might start a university later. But just up to sixteen years, it’s guaranteed. 


So now we have started for only, I think, seven-year-old children a school now near Himalaya; and also now we are going to bring it down. But now after three years or so we’ll be starting school for all classes. For all classes we’ll be starting in a big way, and we’ll be having best teachers and best timings, and we’ll look after them. Only thing is that if the Cambridge University accepts then we’ll have the Cambridge University affiliation, because Indian standards are too high, very high. They have to work really very hard for that. I would prefer Cambridge better. So they might agree to do that for us. That’s how our children can achieve a better understanding of things, and they have more time for other things to do. 


So, so many things we are going to combine there. Basic education of Gandhiji I am going to introduce into that, where children know so much about the trees, about the plants, about animals, about fishes, about the surroundings in which they live, about the Mother Earth, about ecological problems and things like that. And we have to create really great leaders out of them.


So it is for you to decide now the children that you want to send there. You can have children up to seven years here, or six years here for your primary classes, but not for your high schools. But primary classes also we have. If you want to send your children for primary classes we have that also, that we can look after those children who are for primary classes. And there will be leave for the children for two months or three months, I think, for which you can come there, or you can take them anywhere you feel like. But I would not advise you to bring them back here because it’s too much of an exposure, and you know what’s happening to your children. They’ll have to learn how to respect parents, respect everything; and to get the intrinsic value of everything properly evaluated in their minds, so that they do not become stupid. I’m sure this will work out very well. I have seen some children in Rome: they have become so sensible, so developed, so beautiful.


So money-wise also we might have to cut down little expenses of yours, doesn’t matter; for your children you have to do something. That’s the minimum they have worked it out. They said that per month it will be about three hundred dollars for a child, inclusive of clothes, food, transport, everything, books, everything. You don’t have to worry for their expenses at all. You could give them some other clothes, but they’ll have all their uniforms done by them, books, shoes, everything will be done in that amount, and education of every kind. All kinds of arts, crafts, depending on the aptitude of the child. And you’ll see, they will be something very unique children. So think it over. And in that there is a lot of work entailed, and some people are working it out. I’ll be getting some people from here also. And the whole process will be under My control, so you don’t have to worry.


So now, I hope I’ll be coming next year again. But for next year – I mean of course, not this year – but next year we have decided that it would be better to come here in the month of April or May; because May is a better month here than March, and April is quite hot. So what do you say, April or May? May. May, all right. But May, I can only come of fifth of May. After, I said, fifth of May, because we’ll have one Sahasrara Day there and one here. And we can work it out that way to come by May, so we can have one month of May spent here. I would like to spend more time. But you must not have any more groups, quarrels, fighting, problems with husband and wife. I mean sometimes I feel, why did I marry them to create these problems? They were all right without marriages!


So all these petty things should not be there. You should all be big, great people. I would like to come and see you here in your ashrams and things; I would like to know what you have been doing, what creative work you have been doing. It’s beautiful things you can do. All right? 


So with that hope, tomorrow we’ll have this Birthday Puja. And everybody is quite jealous of you that I’m having My birthday here! I love you Australians very much, and you have to also love yourself and have proper value about yourself. Don’t fritter away your lives, don’t waste them on nonsensical things, that’s very precious. If you were not precious, you would not have come to Sahaja Yoga, remember that. You would have been by now in some pub!


All right. Now, so few things we have here. Now, can you read out the lists …? [Hindi] Come along. This …. 


You see, they told Me not to bring anything, and because there is Customs, I think that the Customs torture My life for nothing at all. There are Customs, this thing, that thing. So I’m thankful to Mr Gupta that he could manage to bring some things for you. And I could only buy something in the duty-free shop for you. [Hindi]


So first of all there’s a present for [Hindi] … One for Stephen. These fountain pens are given to the leaders so that they should write a letter to Me! Brian, Mr Brian. Now, others .… Cairns …. It’s all right, I don’t read it. It’s all right … Melbourne … It’s all right. So this is Perth. [Hindi] Brisbane. Brisbane is not here. We’ll keep it for Brisbane.What else? Canberra is not here? All right, keep it. Who else? Adelaide.


For Adelaide, we should try still. I think it will work out now, things are better. Things are much better. It will work out. 


[Yogi: We have given You fifty-four macadamia nut trees, for Your house in Prathisthan … for You to take back to India.]


With Me?


[Yogi: Yes, from the Adelaide collective, for Your birthday.]


Ah, I don’t think I can. But what you can do is to send them with these people when they come. They can be kept here waiting? There’s somewhere here, and they can bring it when they come for the Ganapatipule, all right? For the tour. All right? May God bless you. Thank you. All right.


[Hindi]


So we start giving saris to ladies who looked after Me ... Canberra. So she’s not come as yet? All right. Lyn, is she here? Lyn from Brisbane … Cheryl? … Sandya Sapate … Jo? Jo from Perth … Kay. Kay from Canberra.


Now we have shirts for the boys, of leaders of all the – what do you call it? – ashrams; so you read the name. And now you all should try it, whichever fits you, and I don’t know! First do it, first you people do it, all right. Come along, Cairns, come along. Select. Whichever fits you. These are all loose ones, so they’ll fit anyone … Good … All right, take any one. Looks nice – beautiful! All right ….


With embroidery! ... May God bless you. Take whichever you like. That’s a good one! … Of course, Burwood. What about the New Zealand people? Auckland ... All right. That’s fine ... All right, take it up … 


Oh, blue? You like green … So Melbourne has no, because – Melbourne has no ashram so far. Yes. So they have to have ashram. This is a special gift for Mr Stephen from the leader of Hariyana, Mr Gupta, who has been so kind to bring all these things through your Customs.


So now we should disperse, I think, and tomorrow is there’s puja. If we want to start it’s about eleven o’clock, but try to be there, make preparations, I’ll be ready here to come. I’ll be ready, very ready to come there, but the problem is sometimes it’s not ready. So we have told everybody eleven o’clock we are starting the puja. But let’s see how you do it, because the preparation takes so much time. All right? May God bless.


I gave it today because tomorrow is My birthday; I’m not supposed to give any presents on My birthday! 


(So finish it off now?) Good night, everybody. Sleep early!


Hello, hello, how are you?


[Child: My father’s here.]


Which one? … Deep, deep, deep sleep, eh? What’s your name?


[Shridhara.]


Shridhara, eh? And you are really Shridhara! He’s very good at acting! All these children can be really trained up so well, as they are born-realized. So you will come to India to study? To ride horses? …. Yes, yes. You don’t have to wear in India, there is no need, but we can get you some hats also … They’ll fit you all right. They make hats for every size of head!


All right. May God bless you.
