Public Program. Togliatti (Russia), 5 August 1992.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, conceptualize it. It is beyond our thinking, beyond our mind. So now you have to just open your hearts to what I want to tell you and you need not believe Me blindfolded. You need not also close your mind. You have to be like a scientist and see for yourself [whether] what I am saying is true or not. And when it is proved, you have to believe as honest people.

[To someone in the audience] Do you mind taking photographs after the program? Thank you.

Because it is for your benevolence. And it is for the benevolence of the whole world. It is all -whatever I am saying is the truth and you can verify it. It is absolutely tangible. Whatever is said about the centres that you have within yourself, is the subtle knowledge of your roots. If we grow just like a tree and do not know about our roots, we can be destroyed.

All of us are born with a sense of faith in someone. The sense of faith is, can be for anything. Also, we have our divinity absolutely intact within ourselves. Whether you have belief in it or not, it is there. Whatever mistakes you might have committed, it cannot be destroyed. Because it is absolutely eternal in nature. Every one of you can feel that divinity. This is so important today, specially in Russia. Because communism has gone and there is a vacuum and people don’t know [not clear, probably ‘what to believe’].

I have to warn you that be careful that ideas you have about democracy, democratic countries, are not absolutely correct. There are no moral values, there are no human values left in those countries. In France, a housewife could be a prostitute [not clear]. And the children at the very young age of 12 years, or eight years, are taking to drugs. They say that 65% people in America within 10 years will suffer from some horrible secret disease like epilepsy, like AIDS, and also schizophrenia. All these problems have come because they had no idea about freedom. Their freedom is like abandonment.

Supposing an aeroplane is not fixed properly and has no sense of direction, it will disintegrate as soon as it goes in the air. In the same way they have fallen, and the society is extremely decadent. They follow some sort of religions, but these religions are also money-oriented or power-oriented. They are not Spirit-oriented. Luckily now you have gone out of this kind of a fundamentalism. This is the blessing of communism. But you must understand that in this condition of vacuum, these fundamentalists will take over. Whatever may be the religion, they are all fundamentalist.

All these religions were born on one tree of life at different times. They were born as living flowers, but people have plucked it saying this is mine, this is mine, and are now having dead flowers with them. But within us lies the universal religion. We all laugh the same way and weep the same way. This religion is within ourselves. It is an innate religion. Whether you are Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or anyone, you can commit any sin. But now when you have come out of communism, understand that you don’t jump into this fundamentalists. They will never accept one universal religion because they want to fight, they want to have wars and separate people.

Also, I was not surprised to hear that there are many false masters who have come from India to this country. They are mostly money-oriented. But some of them have come as missionaries, who came to India to give you food and tried to entice you. So you have to be very careful that these people are trying to convert you. Conversion is a farce. You have to get your transformation, your resurrection through the awakening of the Kundalini, which is your own. She is your own Mother. She is your individual Mother. She knows each and everything about you. She is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost is nobody else but the primordial Mother.

In the Bible, there is no word like Madonna. They called Mother Mary as a woman, and even now there is no respect for Her. There is another wrong idea Paul has put in that we are born of original sin. This is absolutely, absolutely wrong. In that case, Shri Krishna, Shri Rama, Nanak Sahib, Mohammed Sahib, all of them were sinners. How can they be sinners? So, one has to understand very clearly [missing portion in recording]. And that is how this Koran has come. So, nothing seems to be so authentic that they should stick on to one book. They stick on to one book and fight with each other. Even Gita has been changed, it can be proved. So, by reading you cannot achieve your ascent.

The second problem is of science. Science will make you robots. It is not conclusive. And it does not know the totality. It can never give you your ascent because it does not talk about your spirituality and your soul. Plus, we have here in Russia a very dangerous system of ESP. Be very careful. It attacks the left-side, and you get possessed. You can easily get any disease of the left-side which are incurable – like cancer, like AIDS, like all the disabilities of the muscles called as 'mellitus'. There are so many diseases – even epilepsy, madness. All these then come to you, thus you cannot produce children. So, please be careful about these ESP people.

This vacuum that you have got, please try to fill it up with truth. You have to be the Spirit. You are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. The nature of Spirit is that it enlightens your attention. And it connects you to this All-pervading Power of divine Love. You see all these beautiful flowers. All this living work is done by this All-pervading Power. And this power once you get connected, which is the yoga, you become empowered yourself.

This is the last breakthrough of your evolutionary process. You can feel this All-pervading Power on your fingertips. Thus, you can know your own centers, which you know that are on the left and right hand. And you can feel the centers of others. All world problems are because of these centers. And human beings are the ones who create problems because they have done something wrong with their centers. By Kundalini awakening, you can correct all problems of your centers. And you can be connected with this All-pervading Power.

The another quality of the Spirit is that it manifests absolutely. We live in a world of relativity. Then we jump into absoluteness. All of us know the same truth. So how can we fight, how can there be wars? And when you know the centers of others, you get a new awareness called as collective consciousness. When the Kundalini passes through this optic chiasma, you become thoughtlessly aware. You come in the present and you become absolutely peaceful. You become dynamic, absolutely healthy and at the same time extremely compassionate. Because this All-pervading Power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of joy and ocean of blessings. Thus, you enter into the kingdom of God.

It is nice to see there are so many people from Togliatti who are such good seekers. You are very honest and sincere seekers. Just you can feel now, please put your hands like this [towards Shri Mataji]. If you put your hands like this, all of you, you can feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

Raise your both hands towards the sky and ask a question. Push back your head. Ask a question, either ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?’ three times. Or you can ask another question, ‘Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of divine Love?’ Ask three times. Or you can ask another question, ‘Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?’ Now take down your hands. And put your hands towards Me like this and watch Me without thinking. Please put them [hands] up a little higher. Without thinking you just watch Me. Now please put right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze-like wave coming out of your fontanelle bone area. You have to forgive everyone and forgive yourself. Don’t feel guilty. If you have done mistakes, it’s all right. You are a human being. And this Power is the ocean of forgiveness. So all your mistakes can be dissolved. Now please put your left hand like this and put down your head. And see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your head. If it is hot that means you have not forgiven, you have to forgive. Now I cannot cross over your freedom, I respect it. Please put your right hand towards Me and put your left hand [above the head]. You have to ask for your Self Realization, I cannot force it on you. So just please pray in your heart, seven times, ‘Mother, please give me my Self Realization, give me Self Realization’. Now, those who have felt cool breeze out of their head on their fontanelle bone area, or hot, or on their fingertips, or on their palms, please raise both your hands.

I bow to all the saints of Togliatti, to all the Sahaja Yogis. Now your saintly life has started. Now you have got the light. You can give it to others and transform others. Give them this beautiful gift of Self Realization. You know it is a collective work, it is not individual. You must know how to use this Power, and you work it out. All your problems will be solved and you will be absolutely residing in the realm of joy.

May God bless you.

I would like to hear them sing.
