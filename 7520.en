Pre marriage talk

Gavin: All the beautiful sarees and kurtas, they are all nicely piled up and looking very beautiful.
 Shri Mataji: Alright good idea. 
 Gavin: They have just started.
 Shri Mataji: You better do it.
 Gavin: No they will first here you mother.
 Shri Mataji: no I am not going to speak today. Ok, a little bit for five-ten minutes.
 Gavin: Shri Mataji will talk to us for five-ten minutes. 
 Shri Mataji: It is really wonderful the way they have done it, it is a real marriage arrangement. Isn't it? It is beautifully done. And we must give a hand to Bombay Sahaj Yogies for organizing it. And now I have to also bid goodbye to all the people who are getting married because they are going to become different people. Today is a special day for us because as per the custom in India, before your marriage you see the bride's party and the bridegroom's party have to give the things they have brought. And they also come with a band which thinks that whatever you have promised you better give us. So that is the day we enjoy the most when people pass their things to others. And as I have told you many times that matter has only one value that you can put your love into it. And you can pass it over. It is an expression of love. It has only one value that you can give to others. All other things you cannot see, they are not in forms. But the matter is the only one that really gives. Even incarnations had to come to give. Without incarnations, without getting a body you cannot give. So whatever matter we have, we have to give it to others. So that we really feel, we are relieved of the exuberance of love that we have within us. That we are able to express it through this matter. That is the main thing we have to achieve through matter.
 Another thing could be that we can have the beauty and all the other expressions of the matter, but that too is useless if you cannot give it to others. It is a kind of circulation of love that goes on passing this great thing called god's love. It's a catalyst, it's a catalyst. Like in a blood cell, the blood cell has to carry the blood but the blood is carried by the cell itself, if the cell is not there, it cannot carry that blood pigment. In the same way pigment of her heart, the pigment of her love has to be carried by the cells that are awakened by you in the matter. 
 So this matter, whatever it is small or big is not important. Whatever is the way we have been able to get it is not important. What colours it has, what kind of fibre it is, what kind of material it is, you are not to bother about it. But try to feel the love behind it. It is very simple. It is very ordinary. We can say we cannot weight it in money. But you have to weight it in your heart. That it is out of love for you, whatever is possible we have tried to gather, and the western Sahaj Yogies who have come here have brought with such love and affection from all the way and I must thank the customs who allowed them to pass out. 
 And the more you give, the more you get. You take it from me. I am fed up of giving, and I don't how the things go on accumulating, I don't know what to do now. So this is what it is. The more you give the more you get. Even if you don't want to take anything. Even if you cry, weep, say now its enough, it doesn't work out. If you give you get ten times more. And you get it in such a way that you don't know how to stop it. So the more you give the more you will have. So open your hearts at both ends by giving and while taking.
 Don't criticize, don't compare, don't tell this has got more. Some people may not get anything. Doesn't matter. Because I might have given them earlier. Might be I am thinking of giving them later. Maybe something like that. So one should never compare. Nor should one say oh she has got it, I haven't got it. Or there are three-four more left to be given. Then I feel oh they are left. If there are few lefts doesn't matter. Be satisfied. It is worth noting. But even that feeling that it is from mother that you should feel dissatisfied. If somebody else has got it, you have got it too. Because we are all one. There is no other. So if one person has got it, you all have got it. So it is manifold that. it is manifold. So it is very-very small measure. A very small thing that we have tried to do and western and Indian Sahaj yogis all of you should try to feel that it is done out of love.
 So nobody should hurt anyone. Whatever is done out of love is great. And I have to thank the Sahaj Yogies from Delhi who has brought 2000 rupees for me and I am sorry I haven't brought many presents for them. For the Pooja because I didn't know what to or how to compensate it. But thank you very much, may God bless you. 
 Alright so now whatever work you are doing you can go ahead. 
 Gavin: Mother I think we can do it quietly while the gift-giving is going on.
 Shri Mataji: Alright so what are you planning?
 Gavin: We will call the names one by one and the couples will receive the things. You would like to see what they are receiving?
 Shri Mataji: Ornaments?
 Gavin: Ornaments are being given to the mama.
 Shri Mataji: Ornaments are being given to the mama. 
 Gavin: That's what the doctor said.
 [Till 7.44 in Marathi]
 Shri Mataji: I would suggest better thing would be, to give it to mama is alright, but it has to be given to her when she is sitting for her, not kanyadan, it has to be given after haldi when she comes there. All these things have to be given to the girl.
 Gavin: By whom?
 Shri Mataji: By me.
 Gavin: By you?
 Shri Mataji: I mean I will be there. I was suggesting like this, when they come there after their bath, we used to have boys and girls sitting in two rows facing each other. So that they see also each other. They shouldn't make mistakes later on. See it is 51 marriages, just see the risk we are running. Only with 27, we had problems, you remember. So they have to be given no1, no.2, no.3, no.4, you see, they are to be given numbers, so at that time warren if you think proper I would suggest that instead of giving to the girl you can give it to the boy. Just now. So what happens when the girl comes for that, the saree, ornaments everything is with the boy. And the mama as well. You put together. So the boy gives everything to the mama and mama puts it to the girl. Mama and the mother. Alright, that would work better at that moment. So I would suggest call the boys and give them the ornaments. And let them see what they have got altogether. You have already given to the mamas?
 Warren: We have invited them, why don't we let the mama sort it out at the back and hand it over just to the boys.
 Shri Mataji: No at this time it is not to be handed over. To the boys, you can. Alright to the boys you can hand it over. Boys must be given all the ornaments of the girl.
 Warren: So we will call them back.
 Shri Mataji: Girls must be given all the ornaments of the boys if it can be done. Alright, sort it out outside. I don't mind.
 Sahaja: This must be done at the auspicious occasion, tomorrow morning you can?
 Shri Mataji: It is alright. Somebody has to do it. It is alright.
 Yogi: Mama can bring it tomorrow morning and put it in your hands. 
 Shri Mataji: No no no, I will be there. I will be just presiding, only thing is they can show it to me and just keep it in the thing. But the mama should not keep it. It should be kept with the boy or with the girl. Boy. And the boy has to give it to the girl and the girl has to give it to the boy. Alright? Finished. So?
 Sahaja Yogi: We tell the mamas to keep quiet.
 Shri Mataji: Mamas just now, how many mamas have you given?
 Sahaja Yogi: Only four
 Shri Mataji: Four only. Its better you bring it back. You see in Bombay all the police people are called mamas. It will be confusion. What I am saying it will be confusion. So why do it? Be direct. At that moment they can give. At that moment. The representative of all the mamas has come here. My brother is your mama. Is a universal mama now. 
 Sahaja Yogi: They have been returned now a mother.
 Shri Mataji: Now returned. What you do is to I would suggest that first of all, all these things are separated, alright, so we can do it tomorrow Warren? It will be better. 
 Sahaja Yogi: We can return tomorrow.
 Shri Mataji: Yes, keep it but with whom? With us?
 Sahaja Yogi: They are all spread at the back at the moment. We can collect them.
 Shri Mataji: Spread out? What is, all the ornaments spread out? Are you another mama.
 Sahaja Yogi: The ornaments in little boxes kept in one big box. They are kept in tight boxes. 
 Shri Mataji: What else?
 Sahaja Yogi: The sari, the dhoti, the kurta, this and that, all is tied up in one pile for a couple. That's all. We can keep the jewellery until tomorrow if you like. But a couple can go and just collect the sari if you wish. 
 Shri Mataji: All should be given tomorrow.
 Sahaja Yogi: The whole lot.
 Shri Mataji: The whole lot should be done tomorrow. 
 Sahaja Yogi: We have just sorted it.
 Shri Mataji: They are in proper bundles. 
 Sahaja Yogi: Yes
 Shri Mataji: Then it is alright. Then keep the bundles together and tomorrow we will do it. The names are written there?
 Sahaja Yogi: In serial number mother. They are all the same. 
 Shri Mataji: And also what I am giving them?
 Sahaja Yogi: Yes
 Shri Mataji: Everything is there.
 Sahaja Yogi: By serial number, we have done. 
 Shri Mataji: But there is something non-serial also.[laughter]. You see because the saris are non-serial. 
 Sahaja Yogi: For example, kamal Shrivastava and jane are number one, so in that pile, there is kamal's kurta and janes sari. 
 Shri Mataji: So alright. If you are sorted out. If it is in a bundle or not. 
 Sahaja Yogi: Well sitting like that.
 Shri Mataji: One on top of another. Everybody whose name he is taking the couple should get it and tie it together in one bundle. And tomorrow you bring it. Alright.
 Sahaja Yogi: And jewellery we keep?
 Shri Mataji: And jewellery also with that. let them have it.
 Sahaja Yogi: Let them have it.
 Shri Mataji: Let them have everything. And tomorrow you come and we will deliver the goods. Let them. Each one of the couples should go and take it, make it in a proper bundle. Keep it with them. And when tomorrow the girls are coming and the boys are coming after their bath then it should be brought back at that time. So the boys and girls are responsible for their things. Alright, so 1,2,3.
 Sahaja Yogi: kamal Shrivastav number 1.
 Shri Mataji: Just now no need. But that time it will be needed. Just now no need. Because that's the occasion you see for marriage. Alright so now you go ahead and get it all the boys and girls. 
 [15.00 to 15.17 marathi]
 Shri Mataji: Let the boys and girls who have to have their things should go and get it. Everything now. All of you.
 Sahaji announcing the names.
 Shri Mataji: No.2. now say the number. There you all of them know numbering. Alright. Don't take each name. why don't you say 1, 2, 3, 4? They will all go fast.
 Sahaja Yogi: I don't trust [unclear]
 Shri Mataji: haan, so number 1, number 2 fast. 
 Sahaja Yogi: Taking the name and asking couples to pick up the ornaments. 
 Shri Mataji: not only the ornaments but everything.
 Sahaja Yogi: Ma they have already collected the other things. Now I come to the new ones.
 Shri Mataji: Oh I see, I see. Alright. 
 Sahaja Yogi: Now we come to the new ones. [name of sahaji couple] pick up the bundle. 
 Shri Mataji; What do you have in Ornament?
 Sahaja Yogi: The ornaments the gifts that you gave, the silver which you gave mother, the locket, the anklets.
 Shri Mataji: Alright, you just collect everything. 
 Sahaja Yogi: [name of sahaji couple] the complete bundle.
 Shri Mataji: And Ganesha is also there?
 Sahaja Yogi: Tomorrow it will be there.
 Sahaji2; Is this the one? They are sitting here Shri Mataji.
 Shri Mataji; See. I knew, mama. Be careful. That's the most important thing. So I think I have given you Ganesha and also I have given you these two. Plus I have given you the chain and the locket and the anklets. And toe rings. That's all. 
 Sahaja Yogi: That's all Shri Mataji. That's all. It's such a small amount of money. Shri Mataji has found beautiful things. You know you are going to get married tomorrow. 
 Shri Mataji: Now I would request the nations those who came forward to forgetting their sarees. Because for every nation I gave anklets but I didn't give the saree. So one girl from every nation who has come here should come. One girl. We will select each. From every country, there must be one girl coming down to get a saree. Who could be called second leaders or something? Because I gave anklets to the boys, silver anklets.
 Sahaji; Bracelet
 Shri Mataji: Sorry, not anklets. Bracelets. And I have got sarees for the girls who are from different nations. On each. I can't give to all of you. I am sorry. But it is a good saree. So every nation you ask one girl to come up whom you think. The leaders must say who is the second. Of course, those who are marrying in other countries and all, you should not take their names. Every country now come up, every leader has to say. Every leader should say a name.
 Sahaja Yogi: Marolyn from Australia. Quickly come. Silagra from Italy. [unclear name] from Switzerland. India from Australia.
