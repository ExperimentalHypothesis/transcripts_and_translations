Rakshabandhan Ceremony. Tannay (Switzerland), 23 August 1983.

I said: 'No we have to put it down that's all.' He said: "How do you do Mother?' I said: 'Very simple, three times you have to go round.' And I put it aside one, two, three. And then he started seeing you know, storm clouds and big formations. And so we arrive here with the rain, running out in the rain, and very cool temperature. All wet. But the thing is, Nature is easy to control...

So today is a very great day, when I arrived here, is the day of Guru - today is the Purnima, is the full moon day of Rakshabandhan, the day when the brother is tied with that [INAUDIBLE] You must show them. So I brought for you all. Tied in the hands of brother, by a sister, for the protection of the brother. And we have a very nice story about it. When Alexander the Great invaded our country, he married an Indian lady, and after certain wars he was arrested by a King called [INAUDIBLE: Kuru?] in Punjab and his wife got desperate. So she sent one rahki like this in a thali like that with the cover [INAUDIBLE] 

Now when he - that was the day of Rakshabandhan - so, what they did, he lifted the cover and saw a rahki, which was presented to him. And on that day you cannot refuse. So he asked the carrier man to give the rahki to him and he asked somebody to tie it. And he asked: 'Now who is my sister, who has sent it?' So they said that it is the wife of Alexander, whom you have arrested. So he just got out of the arrangement; he got up from his throne and then he rushed to the goal and prostrated himself before Alexander and he couldn't understand what had happened. So he said: 'I didn't know that you are my brother-in-law and I didn't know that you are the son-in-law of our family, so I am sorry for doing this thing for you. It is so disgusting for me to behave like this, so will you please come out? And he brought him out and put him on his throne. 

So he couldn't understand what was the thing; he was so flabbergasted you see and then he said: 'Now you can go home.' And he sent him with lots of jewelry and lots of sweets and all that, to his house and he himself was there with him, to see him off. So when he went in, his wife was smiling and he asked her: 'I can't understand what has happened. This king, has he gone mad? He has released such a dangerous criminal like me. I can kill the whole country now'. 

She said: 'Did you see on his hand something tied?' He said: 'I saw on his hand a shining thread being tied, but what does that mean?' So she said: 'Today is the day of Rakshabandhan. On this day I sent him this bandhan, this one, and he tied it, so he becomes my brother. Now he cannot harm you because you are my [SOUNDS LIKE: soltargen?], you are my husband, my good luck, so he can't harm you, and he respected you so much because you are like the son-in-law now, in the family'. And Alexander said: 'That settles it. I am going home. If these people can release such a dangerous criminal for only one thread, what sort of symbolic people are these, I mean they can do anything like that and how can you rule such sensitive people?' 

So you see, he took a poet and many other people with him, to Greece and his name was [SOUNDS LIKE: Chandaverdayi?] and he has written lots of poems about him, about Greece. But so many of his soldiers didn't want to back and they settled down in India with their wives and they are living in some forest in India. So only a thread has done all this goodness. I hope you people will also respect all your feelings with a delicate thread of love from [INAUDIBLE].

And Vishnumaya, the One which today announced our coming, is the sister of Shri Krishna, and you must know...who disappeared in the sky and you know who announced the coming of Shri Krishna later on - Vishnumaya. And after eight days we have the Birthday of Shri Krishna to be celebrated in Geneva. That's why it's very suggestive today that I should bring rahki to you, because a sister will give you this great protection to her brother. 

So when are we having the puja now, what is the idea? Thirty-first. So better do that I think because they have also fetched a sari for a Krishna Puja, for you, and they thought that best is to do the thirty-first puja here. Krishna Puja [INAUDIBLE] than any other puja. [INAUDIBLE] doing the puja now is all right. Are you feeling better now all of you? [INAUDIBLE QUESTION] You know this is Krishna Puja, and Krishna resides on visshuddhi chakra, and visshuddhi chakra is America, so is even more significant now that in Geneva we should [INAUDIBLE] from America. Now can you translate...We had a nice puja for America in London about three days back [INAUDIBLE] the thirteenth day is the [INAUDIBLE] day for puja always, and we had one nice puja there, and I gave a very good lecture, I don't know if you have got the tapes. I don't know...can ask Paul. Did they give you any tapes Paul? 

Yogi: ....videotapes...it's possible Mother.

Shri Mataji: Just have a look. What a nice ashram you have.

Yogi: Your house Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji: Very good, very nice. It has a nice big room I must say, quite a big room. And the area you have outside also, with garden. 

I wore the green because it was all dry. [INAUDIBLE]

Marcus what did you want to bring from there for the puja? [INAUDIBLE]

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
