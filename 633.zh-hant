桑格拉提節崇拜

Sankranti Puja  印度Kalwe  1990年1月14日

Hindi part:

Today’s auspicious occasion is being celebrated everywhere in India. The reason is that the Sun which has left us, has left India, and had moved towards the Tropic of Capricorn, has now returned. And along with the movement of the Earth and the Sun all the vegetation, all the crops, fruit and other things are growing. The time has come for their growth. And all those trees whose leaves were completely removed in the cold weather, appeared as if they have completely died, all those trees are again awakened and started to become green. And that’s why, the significance of this time is that the Earth will again become green, and activities will start again everywhere. Especially in Northern India, where it gets very cold, it is a very special festival, that the sun has arrived and all the work dependent on the Sun will be completely fulfilled now.

So today I transmit best wishes to everyone here. And on today’s auspicious occasion, I could meet you all here. This is also a great joy for Me, I feel. As we consider Sun's appearance as a very great thing, it is much more important, that the Sun of Sahaja Yoga comes on this Earth. Because whatever creativity is in this Universe, the creativity is nourished by the Sun. The Sun gives it the energy, and the creative power of the "Paramchaitanya", its aspect of action, has got activated through Sahaja Yoga. Till now Paramchaitanya was not successful in any task. The reason was, that the Sun had not yet appeared in its courtyard. But now this Sun has risen in the courtyard of Paramchaitanya. And because of that you all have the light of it within you. Because of that light, your Kundalini has awakened, and within you, the field of creation has fully blossomed. And this field of creation you all are developing, in a way that the whole world can benefit from it. And it's a very great and divine thing. This could not take place earlier. In our country many sages  have expressed many ideas about, that such a day will come, when collectively this creation will get awakened.

That creation has awakened now. And that’s why this is not only an occasion for Earth's creation but a great occasion for Sahaja Yoga's creation also. This year specially is considered to be a very important year for Sahaja Yoga, and the light of Sahaja Yoga will establish very deeply in the people. When something starts to establish deeply, then we must understand that along with it, some other important events also take place. Like those who are evil and want to destroy the world, and those who are creating terror, destroying the best things of the world, all such people are consequently destroyed. As soon as saplings start blossoming and if they carry truth within them, they will wreck havoc in the place they cannot blossom and they will destroy everything. In the same way, all the evil temperaments, all the devilish forces, will be destroyed. Like after the Sun appears, all the gloom, all the darkness, is destroyed.

Similarly when the light of Sahaja Yoga emerges then the darkness of ignorance and wickedness, is totally destroyed. So today we are at the brink where we have to take a very high flight. And in this flight we have to understand that we should give up all the burdens within us. We have many types of beliefs, we have many types of wrong faiths, and also there are all types of ignorance within us. We should renounce all this ignorance and with a complete detachment, we should take this flight. And those who cannot detach from ignorance, those who do not get rid of it, such people will not be able to take this flight.

All of you know the significance and divinity of Sahaja Yoga; you are not ordinary people. And that’s why I want to say that those who want to fly higher and want to raise higher, should give up the burden of the many shackles of traditions. Similarly within us, ego and vanity are like a very big mountain. We should destroy this mountain completely too. And we can accomplish that, through meditation, and by completely immersing in Sahaja Yoga, by completely surrendering to it. The person who doesn’t surrender to Sahaja Yoga, is still incomplete, and it's possible to be left behind during this flight, to go to the same hell where others are going. So it's important that everyone strives thoroughly. All those who put efforts and try half-heartedly, I want to tell them, "Please renounce this half hearted effort". Because of this half hearted effort, you cannot achieve anything. Then how can you achieve that great state for which people used to cleanse by penance for thousands of years?

There is no need to belittle or punish yourself, but we must understand that today we are facing a mirror, and we have to completely remove all the defects visible in us. When you observe yourself from outside then you will understand that you have to destroy all these things. By this happening, you will notice that you receive many blessings from God. And receiving those blessing human beings will think that, "I have achieved everything". This is also a great fascination, that I have received this or that, all the worldly things. And like this, when we want to get something, at the periphery of this there are some things which can also mesmerize. But we shouldn't stop there. We have to achieve a great speed. This is the result of good deeds of your many lives and you have to achieve it completely. And we have to renounce those small, petty desires within us, and become completely surrendered and give full contribution to Sahaja Yoga. Only the one who will do this, will achieve it. The one who will not do it, because of any reason, I can tell you openly, that there is not much place in the kingdom of God. Those who want to go there, should think, if they really want to reach there that they have to get rid of all the burdens.

And we have to take just one path, our full efforts should be in one direction, that we should somehow march in this direction and keep progressing. Every year you need to introspect and see how much you have progresses since last year. Are we making excuses and thinking that "we have to do this", "this is important, that is important", or from our heart we want to ascent? And many people also think that through Sahaj Yoga, they will get rid of illness or will get their problems solved, that this will happen, that will happen... They should know that there is only one solution for all the problems, that we should reach that state which is absolute. Then all the things get solved by themselves. You don't need to do anything. So today I have shared with you my opinion. But I want that you should also take a resolution in your heart. What I am saying appears to be very simple, but the temperaments and activities of human beings are so strange that I am also not able to understand them. They say "If you can understand Him, then how can He be God?" but I say "If you can understand him, then how can he be human?" Because human beings are so complicated, so complicated, that to understand them is very difficult. I request all of you that if you have to achieve divinity, the complicated nature should be completely reprimanded, and it should be renounced to. And you should say that you want to achieve that divinity by which anything that you touch gets nourished, vibrated and beautiful. Your life will also become very beautiful very ideal, very joy giving, full of love, and of a very high level.

Infinite blessings to all of you.

在印度,今天是要好好慶祝的日子,因為太陽運行至南回歸線,再從南回歸線到達北回歸線。當太陽回到地球,母親大地的所有創造力便開始起作用。她創造了漂亮的東西如花朵,具滋養性的東西,以及使人滿足的東西如果實。她所創造的草木令我們的眼睛安靜下來,太陽的出現賜予我們多方面的祝福。

同樣地,霎哈嘉瑜伽的太陽已經昇起,到達最高點。它肯定顯示了大地原理的成果,那就是你的根輪。你的根輪的創造力便是你的靈量,它不停地上昇,上昇,開啓你們的存有(being),顯示你生命的成果。它令你的生命非常漂亮,非常喜樂,非常快樂。現在我們正身處將要發動的新的躍進,那新的飛躍的起點。為著這飛躍,我們必須在觀念上、思維上和制約上變得輕巧。我們的思想充滿著制約,我們身上有著各式各樣的思想制約。它們是那麽牢固,令我有時也不能明白人類。我不能明白為甚麽我們可以因為執著於一些沒有價值,沒有意義的事物而迷失。在將要發生更高的躍進的時刻,很多人會落後,不能從中走出來。所以在這階段,我請你們全心全意去靜坐,順服委身於集體。在每一天,黄昏時,你必須想想,我為霎哈嘉瑜伽做了些甚麽?我又為自己做了些甚麽?請你明白你將會有一個非常大的躍進,那躍進必須啓動,為此我希望你們準備妥當。你須要完全的準備就緒,因為在這躍進中,你可能會迷失,很多人可能落後,因為他們不能克服自己的思想制約。

思想制約是各式各樣的_________無知、盲目的相信和各種我們經歷過的事情。還有,我們對國家、種族、個人風格,以及種種判斷別人的制約。我們必須判斷自己,我們是否在霎哈嘉瑜伽文化之中?若你不在霎哈嘉文化之中,對你將會是非常困難,你像登上一艘不會啟航的船。我現在忠告你,那麽你之後不能怪責說:「母親,很多人落後了!」若你發覺任何人落後,請幫助他,請以清晰的理念,肯定的語氣,清楚的指示去糾正他。若你真的發覺有人犯錯,你最好先忠告他。我今天告訴你這些是因為你將要起程,你必須告訴你的同行者,這是一個非常關鍵的時刻,沒有人能把霎哈嘉瑜伽視為理所當然的。

所有其他的事物只是幻象,使你感到世俗的事物沒有問題,你可以掌握世俗的事情。神並不關心那個人富有,那個人貧窮,祂只看那人靈性上是否富足。祂並不介意你受過甚麽教育,你的程度如何,你是否華而不實等等,祂只看你是否純真。

你為霎哈嘉瑜伽做了多少工作?你為神的工作做了些甚麽?所有這些先後次序必須改變,我們必須明白霎哈嘉瑜伽以非常精微的層次審判我們。在這最後的審判,你們被判定為好人。在你將要作的第二次躍進,你們必須非常小心。或許你們之中有些人在心裡以為自己是霎哈嘉瑜伽士,但可能他們實際上並不是,他們在將要發生的大躍進中會被遺留下來。

太陽已經昇起,這是非常重要的。它已經到達最高點。當太陽到達最高點,我們必須非常小心。給予我們漂亮、青綠草木的太陽,同樣會給予我們燒焦的熱力,所以要小心。我們須要醒覺,必須每時每刻在霎哈嘉瑜伽的指引下,明白我們犯了些甚麽錯誤,甚麽令我們感到那麽沉重,那麽困難。

到目前為止,我非常高興,無論我告訴你們甚麽,教導你們甚麽,你們都很平靜,很甜美地接受,亦嘗試把我的教導融入你們的生活中。事實上,一段時間之後,我想我不須要告訴你們甚麽。你擁有自己的光,分辨甚麽是對,甚麽是錯。但我仍要說,特別是西方人,在崇拜中,在音樂中和在每樣事物中,你們必須開放你們的心。若你們不能開放你們的心,事情是不能成就的。因為它藉著住在你心內的靈成就事情。所以,請對任何事物開放你的心。當你決定為霎哈嘉瑜伽開放你的心,你所有的自我、所有的思想制約都會消失。

願神祝福你們
