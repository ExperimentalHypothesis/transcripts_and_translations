[Talk in Hindi ends and English starts]

I am sorry I have to speak in Hindi language because there are so many people who know only Hindi. But I am sorry for you because I wont be able to meet you again as you are going away on the tour.
What I was telling them that whatever maybe taught through religion and whatever they might frighten you, that you will go to hell and this will happen, that will happen, whatever it is, people are not afraid of it. And what do they want? They want that whatever they have to do it, they'll do it. They are not afraid, the fear has gone. Fear of God has gone, fear of sin has gone, all this is finished. 
And that's why it is important to understand that we have to become transformed into new personality. This personality becomes the ocean of peace, ocean of peace and with this peace you can spread peace. And when you are peaceful you see the reality of your life, the beauty of your life.

Then you understand also that others are also as beautiful as you are. Now all this destruction, the wars, all kinds of thing that are going on, because we think [these DEL] the others are there and we are different. We are all one, tied together in one thread - even the Mother Earth is a part and parcel of that, all the stars and all these heavenly bodies all are part and parcel of that and we are one of that.

So this has to change, the world has to change through [UNCLEAR- your work MAY BE], you are the catalyst, through you it will change. Not by talking about it or by threatening people or telling them stories. All kinds of things are going on in this world. Is the transformation which is very important and that is so easy to get because you are seekers, you are seekers of truth. You know it's very easy to get and to be experienced. In that, when you experience that peace within yourself, people see, they are impressed and you can spread peace.

Peace is only possible if there is genuine divine love within you flowing, otherwise a talk of peace is all useless. I've known people who have got peace award; I don't know why they got it. They have no peace within. You must have the peace within and that peace is only possible when you are transformed and transformed into a new being, a new personality. About which all the [all the DEL] prophecies are there, all the scriptures have talked about it, all the incarnations and all the saint have talked about it. That transformation is at hand. If you want to have that transformation, it's not all difficult but you must know you are capable of getting that transformation very easily and retaining it. 

I am sorry now you will be all going on the tour and I wont be traveling with you this time, but I hope you all enjoy your travel and enjoy the art and beauty.

May God bless you all!

I am so very happy to see you all here.

[Mother talks in Hindi for about 3-4 minutes and then gives realization, where She talks in Hindi and English simultaneously. The English part is as follows.]

Please put your both the hands towards Me, please. Both the hands. Please put your right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area, little away from the head, not on top, I mean touching the head. Please hold it and put the left hand towards Me like this. You can feel the cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. May be cool or hot. If you are overactive, if you think too much, will be hot. But just see there will be a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone [area UNCLEAR 6:01]. 

Now, please put your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. 

Now please put your left hand towards Me and put the right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Try to see if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming in. 
Now lift your both the hands, [UNCLEAR. MAYBE are like this] please. Please raise your hands towards the sky and you have to ask one question out of the three questions, whichever you think proper. 

Now, first question is, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask this question. 

Please ask the question, "Is it paramchaitanya, the all pervading power of divine love?"

You can ask the question, "Is it Ruh? Mother, is it Ruh, as described in Koran?" Ask any one of these questions, three times.

Please put your hands again towards Me and don't think because first thing happens that you become thoughtlessly aware. Please put both your hands towards Me and become thoughtlessly aware. Now see if there is cool or hot breeze coming on your hands or on your fingertips or out of your fontanelle bone area. Those who have experienced it, "Aap krupya dono hath apne upar kariye." [MEANS you please, raise both your hands.]

May God bless you all! May God bless you! Everyone who is sitting here has got it. May God bless you! May God bless you!

[Mother blesses all in Hindi]  May God bless you all!
