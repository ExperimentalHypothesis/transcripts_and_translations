Public Program. Vienna (Austria), 18 June 1990.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the outset we should know that truth is what it is and we cannot change it, we cannot organize it. And the truth cannot be known only at the human awareness. It requires a subtler consciousness to know the truth. So what is the truth? The truth is that you are not this body and you are not your mind, you are not these emotions. Nor you are your conditionings or your ego. You are pure Spirit. And the second truth is that all the living work is done by a subtle power which is called as Paramchaitanya in Sanskrit language. Or we can say by the All pervading power of Divine Love. 

We take all living work for granted. We see these beautiful flowers that have come out of very small seeds, I mean, we never even think how this work has taken place. Then we see such a balance in the nature.  A apple tree grows up to a height, a rosebush grows up to a height - who controls it? So when we try to think about it, we reach a point that we do not know everything. Also we do not know the absolute truth.  Truth has to be one, but there are so many opinions, so many ideologies, so many religions, so many quarrels. Why should there be any quarrels if they are based on truth? So whatever I am telling you, you have to take a position of a scientist who has an open mind to know everything. And whatever I tell you, you have to take it as a hypothesis. And then if it is true then you have to accept it, as honest people. 

When you are told about this instrument within us we have to first of all get our Self Realization, the light in which we can know all about it. If we are sitting in the darkness we do not know how we are related to each other. Also when we are in dark we are under illusions. Supposing somebody is holding on to a snake in the darkness, thinking it to be a rope and you tell him that, "This is a snake," he won't listen to you. Till the snake bites he's not going to listen. So the best thing is to put on the light for him to see that this is really the snake. So first the light of your Spirit must come in your attention so that you can see what is wrong with you, what is wrong with others and what is wrong with the whole world. Our civilization has grown like a tree but we have not looked after the roots. We have to know what are our roots. And because of that we are facing so many problems today. You see them much more in the country like America which is really over-developed. The first and foremost thing they have is that they are all full of diseases. I told them about the AIDS in the year 1973, but they didn't like it. 

The same thing like the snake in the darkness. And also told them about 8 years back about a disease in which your conscious mind become paralyzed. Now they call it as a yuppie's disease. But when I went this time so many people have this disease and many people at a very young age are absolutely paralyzed. They are saying that very soon schizophrenia will spread in such a way that maybe you might have 60% Americans suffering from schizophrenia or mental disorders. There are so many other problems like the family system is completely broken down. And children under twelve years are taking to drugs in a very wider way. It is such a great scale of all these diseases that they don't know how to fight it. And 
the worst of all is the violence. In Miami there were children who were below 14 years and they had revolvers in their hands and they were selling drugs and killing people openly. There are so many problems now of ecological imbalances. Whom to blame? Not Divine. It's our mistake. It is a serious matter, we should see that we are now getting destroyed from within, not from without. Thanks to Gorbatchev I don't think there will be any more war. But what about these destruction from within? Diseases like cancer, diseases like myelitis, so many diseases which have no cure. 

What should we do to save this world is a very important point. There are many people who talk of peace. And they have got Nobel prizes in peace but all pretentious. There is no peace within themselves. So there is something missing, which we have to achieve. In the evolutionary process we have become from amoeba to human stage. But we have to go beyond. Because we see we are not yet at that point that we understand ourselves at all. So what is to be done is the problem of modern times. At the same time there are so many seekers of truth. And those people who wanted to use them have used them for money, for power and have exploited them. So many false gurus never existed on this earth. And people are so vulnerable, so simple to accept all these nonsensical things. Recently there was a Christian fundamentalist in America and he said that he can send money to God. And people should send money to him and he is sending the money to God. Now God doesn't understand money, He doesn't know what this money is, is the headache of human beings. But people thought that, "It's a very good thing, we should better send some money to God, He might be needing money." Such stupidity! Such stupidity! And then now that man is caught up and he is in jail, but he made lot of money. They claim something and people just believe that person. I would say you should also not believe Me till you have really become the Spirit. Otherwise you cannot recognize anyone. It is important that we have to have those subtle eyes to see reality. 

I was thinking that we should have some session of questioning but they are saying that it's better that you write them down and bring them tomorrow, so I'll answer all your questions. But we can give about ten minutes for proper questions. I am not here to take anything from you. As one enlightened light or a candle can enlighten another candle I am here just to enlighten your candle. And when your candle is enlightened you can also enlighten another's candle. There is no obligation for Me. So if you have some sensible questions I would like to answer. Then tomorrow if you send the questions or if you bring the questions I'll answer them first.

Wonderful people. (Shri Mataji smiling) So you want your Realization - that's what it is! 

Today only I said that anywhere it is going to happen in a big way, it will be in Austria. That's very true. They are very balanced people. 

All right, so now we can have the session which is a very simple thing. It takes hardly ten minutes for you to get your Realization. Now, first of all there are two conditions we have to fulfil. The first condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all, because it is a myth. Moreover this Divine power is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And if you have committed any mistakes it is quite capable of dissolving it. So the first thing you have to do is not to feel guilty at all. That catches the center here on the left hand side and doesn't allow your Kundalini to rise. Moreover it gives you horrible diseases like spondylitis and angina. So please forget the past. Forgive yourself. And be pleasantly placed towards yourself. After all you are made human beings not to feel guilty. Now you are about to enter, say into the kingdom of God and how can you be guilty? 

The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Also here some people may say that, "It is difficult to forgive." But that is also a myth. Because whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. Are you just - think that such and such person has harmed me and playing to his hands and torture yourself much more. So please try to understand that it is just a myth. And there is nothing like not forgiving. You don't have to think of every individual, who has harmed you. In general you have to say, "I forgive everything." At this point is the center of Christ at the optic chiasma inside the brain. Where the two sympathetic cross each other like that. So at this crossing point it's a very constricted center. So if you forgive then it opens up like that, otherwise closes and it's difficult to raise the Kundalini. So it is very important that you should forgive because I can't forgive for you. So you have to forgive everyone, just forgive everyone. These are the two conditions. 

Now you have to just take out your shoes if possible, because that helps us to touch the Mother Earth. Those who are sitting on the ground are even better off, but they should take out their shoes because it's rather awkward. 

Now there's another thing that I respect your freedom. And Self Realization cannot be forced on you. Actually you have to ask for it. Ask for it in your glory, in your own freedom. So those who do not want I would request them to leave the hall, because I cannot force you to have it. 

It's a very simple thing that takes place. You won't feel any pain, you won't feel any trouble at all. Only thing you will feel a Cool Breeze coming out of your head - Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. And also you'll feel the Cool Breeze of this subtle power. And you'll feel extremely peaceful, to begin with, and you'll be thoughtlessly aware. And some people get it in such a big way that on the first day only they achieve a very great heights of Realization. 

So now first be pleasantly placed towards yourself, you have to respect yourself, you have to love yourself. Now please place your left hand towards Me and both the feet on the ground away from each other. 

Those who are sitting are all right, those who are not sitting. No, need not, you can sit like that, it's all right. If you are sitting on the ground it's all right. You don't have to put both the feet on the ground. Sit comfortably.  

It's all right. You sit also comfortably. Yes, be comfortable. There is a chair behind you if you can't sit proper. The days have come when you can get your Realization in your chairs. (Laughter) I had to make it very easy to suit the modern times. 

So now, place your left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart. Both the feet should be away from each other. The left hand suggests - it is the power of desire, it suggests that  you have a desire to get your Self Realization. You can keep your hand on your lap comfortably. In the heart resides the Spirit. We'll show you now everything and later on you'll have to close your eyes when we'll do the awakening of the Kundalini. We'll be working with right hand on the left side only. 

So now we take down our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. This is the center of our mastery. Mastery of the Laws of the Divine. Then we have to put our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left hand side. Now this is the center of pure knowledge. Pure knowledge is that which manifests on your central nervous system. Which is in our Sanskrit language called as bodha or would be vedha from Veda, means to feel it on the central nervous system. Now, then we raise our right hand to the upper portion of our abdomen. Then on our heart. Then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder we put our right hand and turn our head to our right. Now this center catches when you feel guilty. Is quite a lot today. So I request you not to feel guilty. All right. Now then you have to take your hand and put it on your forehead across. Now please put down your head as much as you can and press it on both the sides. This is the center for forgiving everyone. Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and put your head up as much as you can. This is the center where you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine without feeling guilty and without thinking of your mistakes. Just for your satisfaction. 

Now you have to stretch your hand and put the center of your palm here on to the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. You have to put down your head and press back your fingers. This is very important, press back your fingers so that you put a good pressure on the scalp. Now you have to press it hard your scalp and move it seven times when you put down your head properly. You press it nicely and move it seven times very slowly clockwise. Very slowly. Please put down your heads, put a good pressure, push back your fingers. That's all we have to do. 

Now I would request you take out your spectacles if possible, and also to loosen your ties a little bit, or if there is a belt which is rather tight. If you are wearing any malas from any guru also please take it out. All right. Now please close your eyes. Put your left hand towards Me on your lap. And please put the right hand on your heart. Now here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question three times. You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you feel like. So please ask the question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" 

Now if you are the Spirit then you are your master, you are your guide in the light of the Spirit. So now you please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. And here now you ask Me another fundamental question three times, "Mother, am I my own master?" 

I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I have to request you that you have to ask for your pure knowledge, I cannot force it on you. So please now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard with your fingers. Here now you have to ask for pure knowledge. So please say, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Say this six times because this center has got six petals. 

As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, there's a movement in your Kundalini, it starts rising. So we have to nourish the higher centers with our self confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here now you have to say with full self confidence, "Mother, I am my own master!" Please say it with full confidence. You must be self confident that you are all going to get Self Realization. 

At the very outset I told you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, and you are not this ego and conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand onto your heart and with full confidence say twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit!" 

The Divine power is the Ocean of Knowledge. It is the Ocean of Compassion and Love. It is the Ocean of Blessings, but above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And whatever are human mistakes, this powerful Ocean of Forgiveness can dissolve them. So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and move your head to your right. And here you have to say with full confidence again 16 times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all!" 

I have already told you that whether you forgive someone or don't forgive, you don't do anything, it is a myth. But if you don't forgive then you play into the wrong hands and torture yourself. And do exactly what those people who want to trouble you, want you to suffer. So now please raise your hand on your forehead across and put down your head fully and press it on both the sides. Here you have to say with full confidence, not how many times but with full confidence from your heart, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone!" You have to forgive in general not in particular, don't think of individual people. Please put down your head. 

Now take back this right hand to the back side of your head and please put up your head as far as possible resting on this hand. Here for your satisfaction without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty you have to say, "Oh Divine power, if I've done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." Say it from your heart, not how many times. 

Now you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head as much as you can and now stretch your fingers as far as you could. Put a good pressure on your scalp. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom, I respect it. And I cannot force Self Realization on you. So you have to move your scalp in a clockwise manner slowly saying, "Mother, please give me my Self Realization," seven times. Say it - moving it for seven times also, scalp should be moved seven times. 

(Shri Mataji blowing into the microphone) 

Now please open your eyes slowly. Please put both the hands towards Me, like this. Now put the right hand towards Me like this - right hand, bend your head and see if with the left hand if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head. 

Now, you can raise your both the hands towards the sky and put your head up like that and ask a question three times to Me. You can ask anyone of these three questions three times, "Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Or, "Mother, is this the All pervading power of Divine Love?" Or, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" 

Now bring down your hands. You watch Me without thinking, just watch Me without thinking. 

Now those who have felt the Cool Breeze in the hand and also hot or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. Both your hands please. He didn't do anything, this gentleman, but just sitting here, how can you feel? If you don't do, you don't get it and also others are disturbed. 

See how many of you. May God bless you! 

You all have now touched that Divine power. This is the Real Yoga. 

So now you have to understand the seriousness and that you have to develop it. This connection has to be established. You have to respect yourself  and respect your Self Realization, because this is for the transformation of the whole world. You will be empowered yourself to raise the Kundalini of others. Tomorrow I'll tell you what is the nature of Spirit and how if you become the Spirit, how you also manifest the nature of the Spirit. Also I hope you'll tell your friends to come in tomorrow and work it out. This is the greatest thing to be given to your friends. So tomorrow you will know what is the achievement of being Self Realized. But now I bow to all of you because you have become saints now. 

May God bless you! 
Thank you very much!
