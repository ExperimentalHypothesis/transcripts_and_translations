1987-1004: Talk after Deshera Puja, Les Avants, SwitzerlandFrom Sahaja Yoga Book Project

Please be seated.

Alright that’s what we have unclear(talked plus they can unclear(sing/see)) the slides. Alright, that’s good. I will have some water please.

You have covered this? or they have covered? You? (unclear) I will tell you. Wow. Thank you. So after the puja you all look so nice and fresh. I am happy that you have been able to absorb lot of vibrations. But in Sahaja Yoga it is important to meditate. And meditate, in the morning and in the evening. Then you should understand the collective temperament. If you are not very collective, if you cannot talk to others well, if you cannot be friendly with others, if you find this kind of an inhibition in you, or a kind of a barrier – then know that you need more of collectivity. It’s not how much you adore Me and love Me, it’s what how much you are a sahaja yogi. That’s very very important for all of you. That you have to be great Sahaja Yogis. That’s my aspiration is. That’s my only asking is.

Actually as you know, I am a lonely person, I am extremely lonely in life and I want companions. The companions can come out of you but you have to have a level to be my companions. I am sure you will definitely achieve that level. Through humility, love, compassion, openness and softness of temperament, warmth in your utterances in your heart. A day will come when I will see you all, beautifully knit together. No quarrelling at all, no arguments, no analysis – nothing needed. There is nothing to argue. If you find somebody is quarrelling with you, you better report it to the leader. Not that you quarrel with each other and next day you say sorry, sorry, finished. It’s like any day mundane sort on a street. You are not to fight. You are not to quarrel. At the most you can pull each others legs a little bit.

You should live in a open way, no doubt, but open way doesn’t mean that you take to all bad ways and indecent ways and misbehave here. Know that you are yogis. It’s very special category of people who have to have that dignity about themselves. You can’t cheapen out yourself, you cannot. Whatever may be your backgrounds, past, everything, forget it. At present, before Me are sitting great yogi janas (people) and I bow to all of you.

May God bless you.

I want to thank the Sahaja Yogis of Switzerland for organizing this so beautifully, the whole. I am still wondering if they have done this pillar for us. I mean, I can’t imagine how it’s done. And whole thing has worked out so well. I’ve been wondering about this great Singhasana (throne), they have made for me. They are doing everything with their heart. Full of love for Me. I mean even if they bought the gold, it’s alright. Like because they have done it from their heart. I am going to leave all that for the European and the English to be used for their pujas. Because I know what belongs to Me is you, nothing else.

So may God bless you all. May God give you all the strength, all the courage, all the wisdom to be great Sahaja Yogis of today.

I should unclear(going) down.

[A Sahaja Yogi says something]

Shri Mataji: I know, I know that. My unclear(film) is over unclear(let’s see others). All those who want to come to India must give your names as soon as possible. Those who want to get married also must give your names and fill up the forms with honesty. Nobody should try to hide anything. It is better to be open in Sahaja Yoga. Thank you.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, it’s a little adventure that we did but I hope You will agree. We have a feeling, Shri Mataji, that only as an individual, let us say ourself , let us say anybody else, we can’t express our feeling of gratitude towards You, because You are too much higher than me, us. So it’s impossible to express through words what greatness You have given us. So we thought we have to have, all of our brothers and sisters, because in the combined collectivity, the combined hearts, may be the quality of the expression of our gratitude should be such that You will receive that anyway. And because it is the crowning of Shri Rama, it is  of course Your crowning Shri Mataji. And the crown there was some little jewels Shri Mataji, we didn’t tell You.

Shri Mataji: I saw all of them. I won’t miss anything.

Sahaja Yogi: So each one of this jewels should little bit are the, the hearts of Your children and the expression of the gratitude for Your protection, Your love, Your greatness and I don’t know. And the second thing, what we feel through this coronation is, You are the Queen. You are the Queen of the Universe. And we are Your devotees, we are Your disciples. So, if we are allowed to crown You, it means that we have to have complete adherence, allegiance and surrender. Otherwise, how can we crown You? We are not even able to reach Your head because your head is reaching the Universe. So in our heart we have tried some little poems, unclear(it will be )some little things, Shri Mataji. And some pictures and photographs from You. And through this, whatever may be the quality Shri Mataji, I am sure that all of us will be able to make this pledge of complete obedience, complete adherence, complete gratitude for You. And finally, we thought that through the image of Your photographs, through some poems and through music, we could express what I cannot express, our love for You, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Thank you.Thank you.

Will have some tea. No more unclear(eating), I tell her later. The back lights must be put on. Also this light. The stop light must be put on. It’s better. No no it’s alright, I will be able to follow the other one.

Sahaja Yogi : Unclear() take some more tea? Some more tea?

Shri Mataji : No, I’ll just say a few words.

The exhibition that I saw, really enamored me and I was surprised how you have gone thoroughly into the depth of the lives of incarnations. And how you have brought it so beautifully for all the common people to see it. Inspite genius I should say. And you have used real cleverness to express yourself without exposing very subtle things about Sahaja Yoga. For a  ordinary person it should be really a revelation. I wish we could have such exhibitions also in India. But now after seeing these films and these slides and the music I was surprised at my self. It was so beautifully brought out all the things and so many things which I can not say in words. Which I can not express in your photographs and the beautiful music freely enthralled me. I wish you could take all your screen and everything I show this to Indians. They will be so much happy with you. Unclear(Recently) there have been very beautiful two photographs in Calcutta when they worship me as Lalitha, that is on Lalitha Panchami, they  worship me as Lalitha. Photographs are so beautiful and really I am amazed how the camera has taken, I look extremely yank and sort of absolutely am Goddess. I was myself surprised at the photograph. Unclear() I am absolutely new at photograph. Surprisingly how he has got it. I don’t know, I don’t have those photographs, I can’t find them. But the Calcutta people promised to give you all the presents of that photographs when you come to India. So, may God bless you. See the camera is really very clever and really flatters, I just can’t believe it that camera can picture me so well and can produce such beautiful effects. The choice of the photographs, the choice of music and above all, the commentary was so beautifully delicately written. So tender and nice, so powerful and so poetic that I myself felt I am an another world of beauty, grace and bliss. May God bless you. Thank you very much.
