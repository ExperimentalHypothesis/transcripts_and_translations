Yogi: She is asking that yesterday was the first meeting,

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Yogi: and what is your reaction to it about your feeling to the atmosphere?

Shri Mataji: Great.

Yogi: She is asking how many hours it took?

Shri Mataji: For realization takes only ten minutes. We had to explain about Sahaja Yoga little bit, and they were singing also some music.

Yogi: Have you seen Prague? What was your impression of Prague?

Shri Mataji: Oh, beautiful people. They are very creative. I think I told what Prague means. Pra is enlightened, gue(ha) is the right side, is the creativity.

Yogi: The second question was: What was your opinion to the people here? Do you find any difference between the people here and the people in other countries?

Shri Mataji: Varies. Varies. Great seekers and the people with whom I spoke with It’s a very subtle subject and they understood it well. A deep, Subtle, and they are very deep, otherwise how can they touch it?

Yogi: Next question is: Will you come again this year?

Shri Mataji: Next year I will come definitely, I said this here. I was programmed to go to South America. But when this happened in Russia, I just cancelled that program.

Yogi: At the moment the number of people who give treatment, who heal: healers/scientific healers, do you also have any healing touch?

Shri Mataji: Yes but it is all scientific. They are three doctors from Delhi University got their MD in Sahaja Yoga on various subjects like Cancer and blood cancer I think and Epilepsy and Asthma Hypertension. And there are seven doctors in London who are now doing on blood cancer, Aids, and all that. But, you see the people who are healing here must know how they are healing. They must know the basics behind it. It may be just mesmerism and that’s very dangerous. But if they do not know how they are healing, they cannot protect also themselves. But you are healing in Sahaja Yoga because of your own energy which is residing in your Sacrum bone: the Triangular bone. And it shows that the Greeks knew about it. Because they call it Sacrum means sacred, they knew. Sahaja Yoga relates to science to religions to all the mythologies and to everything. All the religions.

Otherwise, everybody thinks they are alright which they are not. And they fight each other because they cannot have the same opinion. But Absolute Truth is the fact. It’s a fact. Reality. So, once you know the reality then you don’t feel any difference. And you can’t pay for it. Nothing. You are not purchase it. It’s a natural thing, it’s the same evolutionary process. Little breakthrough, the last breakthrough of the evolutionary process. It’s worked out with the living process. As the flowers becomes the fruit, you become that.
