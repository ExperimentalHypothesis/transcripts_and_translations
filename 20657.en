TEEN SHAKTIYAN Date: 21st January 1975, Place: Dadar, Type: Seminar & Meeting

Just like a gardener cultivates a garden, and, nurtures it with love,
and, then he watches out for the blooming flowers in the garden. The
joy the gardener feels upon seeing those flowers is inexplicable. The
name “Krishi” means, from Krishi, Krishi -
you know is agriculture. During Shri Krishna’s time it was
primarily agriculture, and, during Christ’s time it was irrigated
with flowers. This world, this land has been adorned by so many
incarnations before. Today, in this age of Kaliyuga, the times
have come that I should witness the springtime of that farming, to
breathe in the fragrance of those flowers. These vibrations
(Chaitanya Lehriyān) flowing from your hands are the
fragrance, basis which the entire world, the entire universe and the
entire nature is functioning. But, today you are those chosen
flowers, chosen over the ages, so that today your vibrations and your
fragrance should spread across the world, cleanse its sludge and
eliminate the filth of this ocean of illusion (Maya Sagar).
When looking at it, one may wonder how it is possible. Mataji is
making a big statement. But, this is a continuation (Silsila),
and, when the destination has arrived in front you, then thinking
about why it has arrived? How has it come? How can this happen? When
you were walking, did the destination not arrive? When you were
seeking, will you not get your place? But, when you have got it, why
should there be doubts about it.

Today, I want to
tell you about three powers that the Almighty is one. He is not two,
but many. I am just one. I am not many. But, I am your Mataji, my
husband’s wife, my kids’ mother, I am your heavenly mother, their
worldly mother. Similarly, even the Almighty has three forms, three
aspects. In the first aspect, He is the Witness Form (Sakshi
Swaroop). He is the Witness to His play of truth, that He
watches. We call Him Ishwar. We call His powers – Ishwareeya
Shakti or Ishwari. In our Sahaja Yoga, we call this, the
power of Mahakali. The moment when this witness form of His
comes to end, meaning when He doesn’t want to see anything else, He
dislikes something, He averts His eyes from His power play, at that
time everything comes to an end. That is why we call it, as the power
of destruction (Sanhārak Shakti). In reality, it is not
destructive (Sanhārak). But, it actually does all the
planning work for whole of the world’s affairs and ends it too.

The second power
that the Almighty utilizes is His Trigunātmika Shakti, with
which he creates the whole world. In which exists, the huge planets,
the stars, with which is created an immensely pure thing on this
earth. In this aspect, the Almighty is known as Hiranyagarbha
and His wife is Hiranyagarbhini. In our Sahaja Yoga, we call
this Mahasaraswati.

The third power of
the Almighty is the Virāta form, the power of Virāta. The
power by which creatures are born in this world. They achieve their
evolution. Animals evolve into humans and humans (Mānav)
evolve into super humans (Ati mānav), and, thesuper
humansevolve into the Almighty (Parmātma). This power
of Viraat is known as Mahalakshmi in Sahaja Yoga. 

In this way, there
are three powers of the Almighty through which He spreads His
splendor. The first power is known as Ishwari Shakti, the
second is Hiranyagarbhini, and the third is Viraatangna. 
Sahaja Yoga work is the work of Viraat. The Almighty has
bestowed all the three powers in humans too. With one power, whatever
man believes in, (not clear), or does, is the power of Mahakali.
With another power, with which he does all the future planning,
thinks or reflects, is the power of Mahasaraswati. The power
with which he achieves his evolution is the power of Mahalakshmi.
All these three powers integrate in Viraat, in his
Sahastrara. This is authorized. The Almighty has made all the
arrangements to create such a human being. The Mahalakshmi power
ensures Her work is well organized for living beings. She makes so
many selections, makes several choices and transports the deserving
people, deserving animals to that level (unclear). But, humans get
complete freedom to achieve that state so that in his consciousness,
in his awareness, he seeks his evolution and must know how he has
achieved his evolution. Neither can the animals can’t think about
their evolution, but a human can think about it, can see it, and can
know it too, when these vibrations start flowing through his hands. 

The destination has
arrived. You all have reached courtyard. How easy and Sahaja is all
this, but humans have really complicated themselves, too much. It
becomes very difficult for humans. Religion is nothing, it is very
simple, very innocent. Innocence, but when too many brains are
involved how can we talk of innocence. That is why children attain
realization very easily. Because they are innocent. Many things are
happening in kaliyuga. As soon as the power of Virāta is
reinforced, then many materialistic powers from the West which were
downgraded, emerge from the lower world (Pātāl, or hell).
Many men whom we say ‘rakshasas’, their powers grow
remarkably. Both the powers are competing against each other. One
power is dead and the other is alive ..... (unclear). It can never be
stronger than the living power. Because the living power is very
sensitive, very susceptible. For this reason, it is difficult for
them to flourish. A plastic flower can never be more beautiful or
more important than a real flower. Thousands of plastic flowers can
be made, but, just one or two natural flowers bloom. That is why
those who have thrived in Sahaja Yoga, who have achieved much
in Sahaja Yoga, they also wither, then thrive again, and then
again wither. Like a mother nurtures her child with utmost care and
love, likewise, Sahaja Yoga nurtures and nourishes. But the
child also has a power by which it must recognize its powers. 

Through Sahaja
Yoga man can attain the highest state in a short span of time,
for which the great saints and sages had to take thousands of births
and had to do austere penance for thousands of years, and meditate
for ages. We are extremely fortunate that we are born in this special
era. We are normal people born for unusual work. This unusual force
is working at the back end, helping you. The normal has been chosen
in the Virāta to strengthen its Sahastrāra, because
the normal has the power to be the unusual. For the attainment of
truth in Sahajayoga there should be innocence and peace within. Peace
is satisfaction. Someone or the other has some sorrow, some grief,
some confusions. A gentleman in London started saying, “there is a
fierce war ongoing in Vietnam, what are you talking about?” I
replied, “are you going to Vietnam? Are you Prime Minister? Why
are you so bothered? You watch your inner self.” On small matters
you create myth in your mind. Even if a small straw goes in your
eyes, it can damage your eyes. This is not significant. Peaceful,
see, the time has come where the kingdom of God is so peaceful,
satisfying. Sahajayogis should be more peaceful and satisfied than
other people. Must be full of satisfaction and fill the whole world
with your joy. Sahaja Yoga will demonstrate the innate
miracles. A forceful overhauling is ongoing, shake-up is ongoing. 

Some of you here are new people who have come, some are quite old. Some new people easily reach great levels while the older ones are still sitting here. Those who have faith in the limitless grace of the Absolute, knows that He is the creator of the entire universe and it is He who help us sail through. Such a person achieves realization in Sahaja Yoga instantaneously and establishes himself. And once he settles down and then never egresses. Strengthen your faith because such a thing is flowing through your hands. You have witnessed its miracles. Believe in yourself. Know yourself. A lot more is happening. I have seen many children, small children being born are actually those great saints, your fathers and forefathers who are taking a rebirth to help you all. Within 10 to 12 years many great people will come in this world. Preparations are going on for their welcome. They were abused, were hanged on cross, they were beaten. They all will take rebirth today. A new era will dawn upon this world. The blessings and hope of all the religions is that man will get connected to God. Now, we will go into meditation for some time.
