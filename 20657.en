TEEN SHAKTIYAN, Date: 21st January 1975, Place: Dadar, Type: Seminar & Meeting (translation from Hindi and Marathi)

Just like a
gardener cultivates a garden, and, nurtures it with love, and, then
he watches out for the blooming flowers in the garden. The joy the
gardener feels upon seeing those flowers is inexplicable. The name
“Krishna”
is
derived, from Krishi, Krishi
- you know is agriculture. During Shri Krishna’s time it was
primarily agriculture, and, during Christ’s time it was irrigated
with his blood. The fertile land of This world has been adorned by so
many incarnations before. Today, in this age of Kaliyuga,
the time has come when we can witness the blossoming of of that
farming, to breathe in the fragrance of those flowers. 

These
vibrations (Chaitanya
Lehriyān)
flowing from your hands is the same fragrance, because of which the
entire world, the entire creation and the entire nature is
functioning. But today you are those chosen flowers, chosen over the
ages, to blossom so that today your vibrations and your fragrance
should spread across the world, cleanse its sludge and eliminate the
filth of this ocean of illusion (Maya
Sagar).
When looking at it, one may wonder how it is possible? Mataji is
making a big statement. But this is a continuous process (Silsila),
and, when the destination has arrived in front you, then thinking why
it has arrived? How has it come? How can this happen? When you were
walking, did the destination not arrive? When you were seeking, will
you not get your place? But, when you have got it, why should there
be any doubts about it?

Today,
I want to tell you about three powers that the Almighty is one. He is
not two or many. I am just one.  I am not many. But I am your
Mataji, my husband’s wife, my kids’ mother, I am your heavenly
mother, their worldly mother. Similarly, even the Almighty has three
forms, three aspects. In the first aspect, He is the Witness Form
(Sakshi
Swaroop).
He is the Witness to His play of his power, shakti,
that He watches. We call Him Ishwar.
We
call His power – Ishwareeya
Shakti
or Ishwari.
In our Sahaja Yoga, we call this, the power of Mahakali.
The moment when this witness form of His comes to an end, meaning
when He doesn’t want to see anything else, He dislikes something,
He shuts His eyes to the play of his /shakti, at that time,
everything comes to an end. That is why we call it, as the power of
destruction (Sanhārak
Shakti).
In reality, it is not destructive (Sanhārak).
But it actually does all the organisational work for whole of the
world’s affairs and ends it too.

The
second power that the Almighty utilizes is His Trigunātmika
Shakti, with
which he creates the whole world. All the huge planets, stars are
created and an immensely pure Earth is created in this manner. 
In this state, the Almighty is known as Hiranyagarbha
and His wife is
Hiranyagarbhini. In
our Sahaja Yoga, we call this Mahasaraswati.

The
third power of the Almighty is the Virāta
form, the power of Virāta
because of which creatures are born in this world. They achieve their
evolution. Animals evolve into humans and humans (Mānav)
evolve into super humans (Ati
mānav), and,
thesuper
humansevolve
into the Almighty (Parmātma).
This power of Viraat
is known as Mahalakshmi
in Sahaja Yoga. 

In
this way, there are three powers of the Almighty that spread His
splendour. The first power is known as Ishwari
Shakti,
the second is Hiranyagarbhini,
and the third is Viraatangna.
 Sahaja
Yoga work is the work of Viraat.
The Almighty has bestowed all the three powers in humans too. With
one power, whatever is dead, man collects. This is the power of
Mahakali. With
another power, man does all the future planning, thinking or
reflection- this is the power of Mahasaraswati.
The power with which he achieves his evolution is the power of
Mahalakshmi.
All
these three powers integrate in the body of the Viraat,
in
his Sahastrara.
He
is the Adi
Purush
(Primordial man). The Almighty has made all the arrangements to
create human beings in his own image. The Mahalakshmi
power
ensures Her work is well organized for living beings. She makes so
many selections, makes several choices and ascends the deserving
people, deserving animals to a certain level of evolution. But a
human being gets complete freedom to achieve that state so that in
his consciousness, in his awareness, he can seek his evolution and
know how he has achieved his evolution. An animal can’t think
about its evolution, but a human can think about it, can see it, and
can know it too, when these vibrations start flowing through his
hands. 

The destination has arrived. You all have reached courtyard. How easy and Sahaja is all this, but humans have really complicated themselves, too much. It becomes very difficult fora human being to live with simplicity and innocence. Religion is nothing else but simplicity and innocence. But when so many brains are involved, how can we talk of innocence? That is why many small children attain realization very easily because they are innocent.

Many
things are happening in kaliyuga
that
you probably aren’t aware of. As soon as the power of Virāta
is
strengthened, at the same time the powers of many people who were
downgraded to hell (Pātāl)
like waste materials whom we say ‘rakshasas’,
grow remarkably too. Both the powers are competing against each
other. One power is dead and the other is living. the dead energy can
never be stronger than the living power. However, the living power is
very sensitive. For this reason, it is difficult for it to flourish.
A plastic flower can never be more beautiful or more important than a
real flower. Thousands of plastic flowers can be made, but, just one
or two natural flowers bloom. That is why those who have thrived in
Sahaja
Yoga,
who have achieved in Sahaja
Yoga,
they also wither, then thrive again, and then again wither. Like a
mother nurtures her child with utmost care and love, likewise, Sahaja
Yoga
nurtures and nourishes. But the child also has a power by which it
must recognize its powers. 

Through
Sahaja
Yoga
man can attain the highest state in a short span of time, for which
the great saints and sages had to take thousands of births and had to
do austere penance for thousands of years, and meditate for ages. We
are extremely fortunate that we are born in this special era. 
We are normal people born for unusual work. This unusual force is
working from behind the curtain, helping you. The ordinary people
have been chosen by Virata to reside its
Sahastrāra,
because the ordinary has the power, not the extraordinary. In Sahaja
yoga the foremost thing is that there should be innocence and peace
within. Peace is satisfaction. Someone or the other has some sorrow,
some grief, some confusion. A gentleman in London started saying,
“there is a fierce war ongoing in Vietnam, what are you talking
about?” I replied, “are you going to Vietnam? Are you the
Prime Minister? Why are you so bothered? You watch your inner self.”
We shouldn’t fill our lives with small, trivial problems. Your eye
can get damaged even if a small speck goes in your eye. This is not
significant. Be peaceful, because the time has come when the kingdom
of God is going to established on this earth. Be content. Sahaja
yogis should be more peaceful than other people. They must be full of
satisfaction and fill the whole world with their joy. Sahaja
Yoga
will demonstrate the innate miracles.  A forceful churn is going
on, shake-up is going on.  

Some of you here are new people who have come, some are quite old. Some new people easily reach great levels while some older ones are still sitting here. The one who has faith in the limitless grace of God Almighty (Paramatma), knows that He is the creator of the entire universe and it is He who helps us sail through, such a person achieves realization in Sahaja Yoga instantaneously and establishes himself. And once he settles down, he never regresses. Strengthen your faith because such a thing is flowing through your hands. You have witnessed its miracles. Believe in yourself. Know yourself. A lot more is happening. I have seen many children, small children, being born. They are actually those great saints, your fathers and forefathers who are taking rebirth to help you all. Within 10 to 12 years, many great people will come in this world. Preparations are going on for their welcome. They were hung on a cross, they were beaten. They are all going to take rebirth now. A new era will dawn upon this world. There is a small waiting time now. Have faith in God. The essence, blessings and hope of all the religions is that man will get connected to God and become the truth.

Now, we will go into meditation for some time.  There isn’t anything to do. Within you the seed which is in a dormant state, will flourish. Close your eyes and witness your thoughts. People who are unwell, in physical pain, tormented because of lack of the blessings of the Goddess Lakshmi (financial problems) and other types of problems, they all will get solutions to all their problems. However, feeling of the real (unclear) is most important. Everyone should place their hands like this in front of me. All that is dead from the past, your knowledge, sorrows, troubles and all the plans about the future, hopes, disappointments, and all worldly things that are troubling you, leave them now at this moment, and get awakened. Only by being in the present, will this fourth dimension open. It is not in the future or the past, that’s why you should get it at this moment. Only this moment is important, and as you are sitting down now, you have to make this jump and progress further. To get awakened in this moment, is Sahaja yoga, is spontaneous salvation.

Don’t move and with your eyes closed take your attention to your forehead, to your sahastrara. Take your attention to where the fontanelle bone area is. Don’t force it. With ease, just think about what’s happening on the top. Like sitting down here, you think about the matters of your home. Peacefully and slowly in your hands, is possible that some of you might feel little heat. You can shake your hands if you are feeling heat. If there is no heat, then keep your hands straight like this, and you will feel that there is a cool breeze coming from inside. If you take your attention to the forehead, you will see that there are no thoughts. This is thoughtlessness, you will become thoughtless.

Just sit with complete peace from within. Tell you mind that ‘you are trying to tell me many things and don’t try to trick me. I want to go there’. This mind that is tricking you, is testing you, you ask it to stop.

Sahaj yoga works in collectivity, it’s not for one person, it’s not individual. You all are the pores of one collective being (Virat). It doesn’t depend on one person. You will know that you are the parts of one body. You are not alone in collective consciousness (samuhik chetna). You are all part and parcel of the same body, there isn’t the other. You will feel that everyone is our own.

People who have come for the first time and haven’t been here before, please stay seated. Those who have been here before, have had their realisation and understand, they can get up slowly and move to the back one by one and stand at the back and look after others. Please don’t disturb others, move slowly to the back. Those who have just come, please stay seated with eyes closed. The new people who can feel vibrations on their hands, who can feel something flowing through their hands, please raise your hand.
