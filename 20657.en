TEEN SHAKTIYAN, Date: 21st January 1975, Place: Dadar, Type: Seminar & Meeting (translation from Hindi and Marathi)

Just like a gardener cultivates a garden, and, nurtures it with love, and, then he watches out for the blooming flowers in the garden. The joy the gardener feels upon seeing those flowers is inexplicable. The name “Krishna” is derived from Krishi, Krishi - you know is agriculture. During Shri Krishna’s time it was primarily agriculture, and, during Christ’s time it was irrigated with his blood. The fertile land of this world has been adorned by so many incarnations before. Today, in this age of Kaliyuga, the time has come when we must witness the blossoming of that farming, breathe in the fragrance of those flowers.

These vibrations (Chaitanya Lehriyān) flowing from your hands are the same fragrance due to which the entire world, the entire creation and the entire nature is functioning. But today you are those chosen flowers, chosen over ages to bloom today and your fragrance would spread across the world, cleanse its sludge and eliminate the filth of this ocean of illusion (Maya Sagar). When looking at it, one may wonder how it is possible? Mataji is making a big statement. But, this is a continuous process (Silsila). And, when the destination has arrived in front you, then thinking about why has it arrived? How has it come? How can this happen? When you were treading, must the destination not come? When you were seeking, must you not get your upliftment (Utthaan)? But, when you have got it, why should there be any doubts about it?

Today, I want to tell you about three power; that the Almighty is One. He is not two, He is many. I am just one.  I am not many. But, I am your Mataji – my husband’s wife, my kids’ mother, I am your heavenly mother, their worldly mother. Similarly, even the Almighty has three forms, three aspects. In the first aspect, He is the Witness Form (Sakshi Swaroop). He is the Witness to His play of His power (His Shakti) that He watches. We call Him Ishwar. We call His power – Ishwareeya Shakti or Ishwari. In our Sahaja Yoga, we call this, the power of Mahakali. The moment when this witness form of His comes to an end, meaning when He doesn’t want to see anything else, He dislikes something, He shuts His eyes to the play of His Shakti, at that time everything comes to an end. That is why we call this the power of destruction (Sanhārak Shakti). In reality, it is not destructive (Sanhārak). But, it actually does the planning for all of the world’s affairs and ends it too.

The second power that the Almighty utilizes is His Trigunātmika Shakti, with which he creates the whole world. All the huge planets and stars are created in it, and, an immensely pure thing is created on this Earth.  In this state, the Almighty is known as Hiranyagarbha and His Shakti is known as Hiranyagarbhini. In our Sahaja Yoga, we call this Mahasaraswati.

The third Shakti of the Almighty is in the Virāta form, it is the power of Virāta. This is the Shakti with which creatures are born in this world and they achieve their evolution; animals evolve into humans and humans (Mānav) evolve into super humans (Ati Mānav), and, the super humans evolve into the Almighty (Parmātma). This Shakti of Virāta is known as Mahalakshmi in Sahaja Yoga. In this way, these three powers (Shakti) of the Almighty spread His splendour. The first is the Ishwari Shakti, the second is the Hiranyagarbhini, and the third is Virātāngna.

Sahaja Yoga work is the work of Virāt. The Almighty has bestowed all the three powers (Shakti) in humans too. With one power, whatever man churns and collects, it is the power of Mahakali. With another power, man does all the future planning, thinking or reflection – this is the power of Mahasaraswati. The power with which he achieves his evolution is the power of Mahalakshmi. All these three powers integrate in the body of the Virāt, in its Sahastrara. He is the Adi Purush (Primordial man). The Almighty has made all the arrangements to create such human beings who reflect His own image. The Mahalakshmi power ensures Her work is well organized for living beings. She makes selections, makes choices and ascends the deserving people, deserving animals to a certain level of evolution. But, when they reach the level of a human being, he gets complete freedom, so that in his consciousness, in his awareness, he can seek his evolution and gets to know how he has achieved this evolution. An animal can’t think of its evolution, but a human being can think about it, can see it, and can know it too, when these vibrations start flowing through his hands.

The destination has arrived. You have reached this courtyard. How easy and Sahaja all of this is, but humans have really complicated themselves too much, have deranged themselves. It becomes very difficult for a human being to live with simplicity and innocence. Religion is nothing else but simplicity and innocence, absolute innocence. But when so many brains are involved, how can we talk of innocence? That is why many small children attain realization very easily because they are innocent.

Many things are happening in Kalyuga that you probably aren’t even aware of. As soon as the power of Virāta is strengthened, at the same time the powers of many people who were downgraded to hell (Pātāl) like waste material, whom we say ‘rakshasas’, they grow remarkably too. Both the powers (Shakti) are competing against each other. One power is dead and the other is living. The dead energy (Shakti) can never be stronger than the living power. However, the living power is very sensitive. For this reason, it is difficult for it to flourish. A plastic flower can never be more beautiful or more important than a real flower. Thousands of plastic flowers can be made, but, just one or two real flowers can bloom. That is why those who have thrived in Sahaja Yoga, who have achieved something in Sahaja Yoga, they also wither away, then they may thrive, and then wither again. Like a mother nurtures her children with utmost care and love, likewise, Sahaja Yoga nurtures and nourishes. But the child also has a power by which it must recognize its powers.

Through Sahaja Yoga, an individual can attain the highest state in a short span of time, for which the great saints and sages had to take thousands of births and had to do austere penance and meditation for thousands of years and for ages. We are extremely fortunate that we are born in this special era.  These are normal people born for unusual work. This unusual force is working from behind the curtain, all these forces are helping you. The ordinary people have been chosen by Virāta to reside in its Sahastrāra, because the ordinary has the power (Shakti) to be extraordinary. In Sahaja Yoga the foremost thing is that there should be innocence and peace within. Peace, satisfaction. Be satisfied! Someone or the other has some sorrow, some grief, some confusion. A gentleman in London started saying, “there is a fierce war ongoing in Vietnam, what are you talking about?” I asked, “are you going to Vietnam? Are you the Prime Minister? Why are you so bothered? You must watch your inner self.” We shouldn’t fill our lives with trivial problems. Your eye can get damaged even if a small speck goes into it. Is this not significant? Be peaceful! Because the times have come when the kingdom of God is about to be established on this earth. Be content! Sahaja yogis should be more calm and peaceful than other people. They must be full of satisfaction, must blossom and must fill the whole world with their joy. Sahaja Yoga will demonstrate the innate miracles.  A forceful churning is ongoing, shake-up is going on.

Some of you here are new people, some are quite old. Some new people easily reach great levels while some older ones are still stagnant here. The one who has faith in the limitless grace of God Almighty (Paramatma), who knows that He is the creator of the entire universe and it is He who helps us sail through, such a person achieves realization in Sahaja Yoga instantaneously and establishes himself. And once he settles down, he never regresses. Strengthen your faith because such a thing is flowing through your hands and you have witnessed its wonders and miracles. Have faith in yourself. Know yourself.

A lot more is happening. I have seen many children, small children, being born. They are actually those great saints, your fathers and forefathers who are taking rebirth to help you all. Within 10 to 12 years, many great people will be reborn in this world. Preparations are going on for their welcome. They were hung on a cross; they were beaten. They are all going to take rebirth now. A new era is about to dawn upon this world. These are the testing times, have faith in God. The essence blessings and hope of all the religions that man will be connected to God is about to come true.

Now, we will go into meditation for some time. Nothing is to be done. The dormant seed within you will flourish. Close your eyes and watch your thoughts. The people who are sick, are suffering physically, are devoid of Goddess Lakshmi’s blessings, all other sufferings will come to an end. But the real esteem should be achieved. Everyone open your hands towards Me. And whatever has happened in the past which is dead – knowledge, pain, sufferings; and, whatever you have planned for future, all hope and despair; anything and everything that may have ever troubled you, leave all that now, in this very moment. Awaken at this very moment. You can achieve the fourth dimension only when you are awakened in the present. Neither can you achieve it in the future nor in the past, that is why you should get this at this moment. This moment is crucial wherever you are sitting. At this very moment you will submerge and grow into it. Being awakened in this moment is Sahaja Yoga – spontaneous salvation. Do not fidget around, close your eyes and put your attention on your Sahastrāra; put your attention at the point where you have the fontanelle bone. Don’t force it, effortlessly try to watch what is happening there. Like you think of your homes when you are sitting here. Relax and observe your hands, initially few people can feel some heat in your hands, jerk your hands if you feel the heat. If there is no heat, keep your hands straight and you will feel a cool breeze flowing through your hands; when you will observe your head, you will notice that there are no thoughts. This is thoughtlessness. Sit peacefully and be relaxed and tell your heart, “do not say anything, you’ve spoken enough, I have to go there.” This heart of yours is misguiding you, is testing you. Tell it to stop.

Sahaja Yoga is collective, it’s not of an individual. You all are part of the Virāta and not dependent on one individual. All are part of the same body. You will realize this in the collective consciousness. You are not alone; you are part and parcel of the same body. There is no outsider, all are your own, you must know this.

People who have come for the first time and haven’t been here before, please stay seated. Those who have been here before, have had their realisation and understand, they can get up slowly and move to the back one by one and stand at the back and look after others. Please don’t disturb others, move slowly to the back. Those who have just come, please stay seated with eyes closed. The new people who can feel vibrations on their hands, who can feel something flowing through their hands, please raise your hand.
