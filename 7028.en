Public Program. Bogota (Colombia), 20 July 1988.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

When we talk of truth we have to know that the truth is, was and will be. We cannot organize it, we cannot change it and we cannot conceive it. We have to understand it as it is. But the truth that we know only through our sensitive central nervous system, like I see you all sitting here and also you can see Me sitting here through you eyes is the truth. Or the thing, you heard the music from your ears, through your sense organs. Whatever you have known through that, through your feeling is the truth. It cannot be your imagination or your ideas which you have got in your heads from your childhood or maybe that somebody has put it into them.

So we have to be honest in our seeking and whatever we have found to be of no use or which is not honest we have to give up.

Now whatever has been told to you about your chakras, about your subtle being inside, all this is the knowledge of the roots. We have through our science advance quite a lot. We know lots of things that are existing but this is the knowledge of the roots. Now as a scientist and as a scientific mind you should keep your mind open to see whatever I am telling you is the truth or not.

So when we became human beings we developed certain senses within ourselves in our evolution. Like if you take a dog or a horse and ask them to go through a very dirty lane, it will not feel hurt, it will just pass through. But for a human being it is very difficult. An animal does not understand anything that is beautiful. Now we have achieved a lot as human beings but still we have not achieved the absolute because there is so much difference of opinion, everybody thinks that he is correct and everything that we find is a chaos today. So to achieve that absolute state something more has to happen in our living evolutionary process.

What is that is already told to us in all our scriptures. Christ has said that, "You are to be born again." Now when He said that, you cannot just take a certificate that I am born again and go about saying, "I'm born again." But when you are born again, something has to happen within yourselves.

Today is your Independence Day and I congratulate you for getting your Independence. But still we have to have our full freedom. Because we succumb to temptations, succumb to falsehood, we are tortured by people, oppressed by people, so many problems exist. We have not been able to free ourselves of our problems either physical or emotional or mental, even spiritual. For this there is a very, very simple method of the last breakthrough.

For your evolution as human beings you did not pay anything, you did not put any effort. I have come here to give you the message that you don't have to pay, you don't have to work hard, it is just there, you have just to have it. You are all ready to get it, you are all ready to become that, there is nothing to be done anymore. Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another light without any difficulty; in the same way it will work out. By this you will become realized souls. Like this instrument (the microphone) is prepared and unless and until it is put to the main it does not work, it has no meaning. So you are perfectly made for that, only thing you have to be connected to the mains. You will be amazed by this connection; so many things happen that we can't believe how we are so glorious and so beautifully made. This is our own, our own property which is not known to us, which you suddenly discover and you are amazed at yourself.

There is the power within us which I call as the power of the Holy Ghost, which is reflected in the triangular bone called as sacrum. Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother; how can you have a son and a father without a mother. So this Primordial Mother is reflected within us in the triangular bone called as sacrum. When it is awakened we get connected with the divine power of God's love.

Many people don't believe in God because wrong things have been done in the name of God. But there is God and we have just to reach that stage where we can feel His love, His all pervading power around us, like cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

You get your real baptism and you find as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood and the bone becomes also soft like a child's bone. Then you start feeling the cool breeze all around yourself as very beautiful cool vibrations. Such a person becomes extremely powerful, he becomes powerful with his compassion. Wherever his attention goes he cures that problem and such a person has a personality or a temperament that when he is among the people who are disturbed and troubled, their problems disappear.

The attention itself becomes collectively conscious, means you can feel another person on your fingertips, the centers. You can feel it within yourself, also what is wrong with you on your fingertips. This is what has to happen to all of us when we become really peaceful within and when we are peaceful, the peace spreads everywhere.

There are great organizations who talk of peace, peace foundations, this peace and there is no peace within. It is all artificial, men-made. But when the human beings become peaceful within themselves, there is no problem and they start enjoying each and everything of creation, and the best thing, they enjoy are the human beings and one starts understanding how beautiful God has created these human beings.

It is very surprising that so far I have not been able to come to such a beautiful place for this work, but I have been here before for some official work of my husband. At that time, I did feel the beauty of this place but there was not time to do this work. I think this was the time I had to come and I am sorry for being so late in my coming here; because once you become that, you become the source of joy for yourself and for the others and the Joy does not have duality like happiness and unhappiness, it is an absolute thing; you become the witness and start seeing the whole thing as big drama as if when you are in water, you are afraid of getting drowned, but once you came into the beat you can see all those waves with fun. But when you are experts swimmers, you can save many who are getting drowned.

So this has been written long time back by William Blake, that men of God that is the category of people who are seekers, will become so godly that they will start saving other people, So though we find that in modern time there is so much of chaos, so much of tensions, so much of problems, there is one thing definite in this special area only now people are seeking the truth.

I must have given many lectures on Sahaja Yoga and as you must have heard from him that Sahaja means spontaneous and Yoga means the union with the Divine. After the realization, you yourselves become the knowledge but before that you better get your realization first.

Because say there are beautiful lights here and if you have to put them on, I have to just say, that just press one button and all the lights are coming; if I have to tell you about the history and all the organization and everything of this electricity, it will be boring.

As a Mother, I would say, if I have done the cooking and if you are hungry, you'll just say, "all right, Mother, now serve the food." So there is no end to my talking about it, it's better we should have our Self realization.

May God bless you all!

Question (Q): Has sexual energy something to do with the Kundalini?

Nothing. It has nothing to do, is a wrong idea. You see (on the Chakra chart) the red chakra is the chakra for our excretion, for our sex energy. The Kundalini stops at the gate of Christ, at the Agnya chakra because if your eyes are very much wobbly then the Agnya chakra gets blocked. But in Sahaja Yoga, we believe in beautiful marriages, but not in funny type of perversions, but we don't have to tell you anything, because you become your own guru, because Spirit is your master and once you start seeing everything in the light, you yourself drop out.

For example, you are holding a snake in the darkness, you can't see it and if I say drop it, you will say, no I am holding a rope, why should I drop it. But if there is light you will immediately drop it yourself. So with realization you develop your divine wisdom as well as your divine discretion.

Q: Are Sahaja Yoga and other types of yoga more or less the same?

You see every yoga that they talked of, was established thousand of years back in India; like you can say Hatha Yoga or Raja Yoga; but the way these things are practiced today are very unscientific, because unless and until Kundalini starts rising you cannot say where is the problem and if you do any exercise indiscriminately, is going to harm you.

Q: Is the awakening of the Kundalini, that we shall get tonight, something permanent, something that will occur just for a moment? And what should we do to keep it?

Good question. It happens spontaneously and it just works that moment but the Kundalini is the one that emerges though your system, from your fontanel bone area and She finds that there is a problem, say in you liver, then She goes back there and starts working there on the liver to cleanse it. So with the experience one start knowing how the Kundalini works on the various centers then She starts establishing and is established in a permanent way. As we can say when a seed is sprouting the little (premune?) sprouts and then you have to look after the little tender plant for sometimes, then it becomes a tree. Within one month time you become an expert and here you have a center open every day where you will come to know everything.

Q: Kundalini is a force in itself, what is the way of increasing the power of Kundalini and what is the relationship between Kundalini and the Spirit?

Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and His Power is the Holy Ghost. When He (the Spirit) and the Kundalini both of them meet then it is like a little flame which burns within our hearts as Spirit, gets the force and the whole thing becomes enlightened. It is such as vast knowledge ... once you have your realization, it is better to understand these things in one light then to understand it without lights: when we are in darkness, we cannot talk of the colors, in the same way, let there be light, then we can understand it better.

Q: It's quite a new knowledge; it is said it is dangerous to wake up Kundalini when the chakras are not purified; it is a fire that is burning. What is your spiritual power that makes that the Kundalini can come up and not damage us, and why is the time so short?

The first thing is absolutely wrong and false that the Kundalini gives you problems; because people who do not know, who have no authority from the Divine try to try some tricks on people; as a result of that the deity of innocence gets angry and you get the result as heat in the body.

Now the Kundalini is the Primordial Mother, your own individual Mother, your own Mother; when your mother gave your birth, she took all the trouble upon herself and she did not give you any trouble, did she? And She knows everything about you. She knows your past, She knows all your weaknesses and She is so kind, so gentle and She some way or another manages this second birth. As far as Myself is concerned I don't want to say much about Myself because Christ was the Son of God, He was the Path and He was the Gate and when He said that and people crucified Him. That was the truth but people can't bear the truth without realization. I don't want to get crucified because you know the time is so short.

Q: Is Sahaja Yoga the only way and what is the function of trantra yoga?

Tantra means the instrument, actually in the pure sense of the word. But those who called themselves tantrikas are just the opposite of what is the tantra. They know how to spoil your instrument, just to capture you, it gives you the negative forces, just to take away your freedom. They try to control your money, they try to control your family, this is not divine. It's black magic in a way, in a western language is black magic.

Q: Does the Word of the Holy Scriptures have something to do with the Kundalini?

Yes, yes and the description of the Kundalini, of all this instrument is the Tree of Life ...

Q: If the Kundalini has been, is and will be always in connection with the Spirit, then why does the Spirit incarnate?

But the Spirit does not incarnate. It's quite a good question that we should have been born as realized soul, what was the need to have the separation, is the correct question. That's what you mean? The answer is very simple, you know the story of Adam and Eve, everything was done so well; if they had listened to God, we would not have gone through all the problem. But they did not. They made a mistake; this is the main original problem they created for us. So we had to go through everything so called knowledge which is not real knowledge and then come to this.

At human level you are given freedom. But they never wanted to use the way God wanted them to use, so they went in a roundabout way. So God said alright, go ahead, find out for yourself and then He'll come and give at the last when you will be ready to receive the Truth. And even now I am telling you can get it without any difficulty, it's your own right, you have it, it's your own, still people are finding it difficult in their freedom. So that is human being you see. He can't accept anything. They have to learn though making mistakes, going into problems, then they learn it. Sometimes they are too conditioned, sometimes they are too egoistical and they cannot discriminate between the Truth and untruth.
