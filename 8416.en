First a pattern of the path is created by the first seeker, is to be made with greatest care and love and once all the map is ready you know which is the shortest way. This knowledge then becomes the part of the unconscious, which helps much faster.... The unconscious plays the role of registration of all the findings of the conscious being and enacts according to the findings of Sahaja Yogis as well as Adi Shakti.
