Talk to yogis at India Tour. Aurangabad (India), 7 December 1988.

To begin with Maharashtra is the country where I would say the Ganesha principle is very strong, because there are eight Ganeshas which have come out of the Mother Earth. And all the three powers are represented by Mother Earth also here: MahaKali, MahaLaxmi, MahaSaraswati. So the whole place is very vibrated and the Mother Earth is very much vibrated. Now if you have any problem of Mooladharas, for example, on this land if you sit down on the ground and put My photograph in front of you and put your left hand towards the photograph and the right hand on the Mother Earth and say the Mantra of Shri Ganesha or Shri Atharva Sheersha, your left side will be cured. Left side is cured means, Left Swadisthana first of all. So many of you have been to so many gurus, this, that and have done wrong things - that gets corrected. 


Also you have seen that, in the West, abortion is a very common thing that happens to women, maybe because of bad Mooladhara, or maybe by Left Swadisthana, whatever it is, we don't have to bother about the past or about the reason why it is so. So if you take your vibrations on the left hand side, then you clear out your Mooladhara in such a manner that the problems of the Mooladhara are solved. That is very important for all of us, but this you can't do anywhere else, I think, that good, - I mean you can of course, Mother Earth is everywhere, - but here it is a special place for Mooladhara Chakra, where it clears you very much and fills you up with Holiness and Auspiciousness. These are the two qualities of Shri Ganesha, which you can imbibe very easily in this place. So try to sit on the ground as much as you can, and try to meditate with your left hand towards the sun and right hand on the Mother Earth. Can you do that now? Let's see - left hand towards the sun and right hand on the Mother Earth... 


So, instead of cleansing it through your Agnya, you can cleanse it through your Mooladhara. There are only two ways you can clear out your left side is, one is your Agnya and another is your Mooladhara. This is the easiest thing to do here and you must have noticed the people have a very good Mooladhara in Maharashtra. They have no problem of their Mooladhara. The way they dance, the way they become innocent, see, their eyes are so innocent. There's no lust, there's no greed, it's vanished. They are just appreciating you in thoughtless awareness, sort of thing, just looking at you, see, appreciating as if some Gods have come down or something. Moreover, this place is very vibrated, otherwise also, because lots of saints have lived here. They have left their vibrations and Shri Rama and Sita have walked on this soil bare feet. It is a very vibrated place - see now. Better? See how the Mother Earth is sucking in. 


That is the reason why this tour has a big significance for all the Western people, because there have been quite a big attack on your innocence. And that has to be re-established and we have to work it out. And is a very serious attack. Now their not only attacking the young people but even children are attacked, all the time the innocence is in danger. So one has to become very rich in your innocence and in your holiness and very powerful so that you can emit this holiness everywhere. 


Now, the second point is that we are an international religion. We don't belong to any country, none of us belong to any country. That we are not Italians, we are not Indians, we are not Australians. What we are - we are in the Kingdom of God. So we are Men of God as described by William Blake. So we are Men of God and that we have no bondage to any of these ideas that we belong to this country or to that country. 


Once you understand this point in your collectivity, then you will expand. Not only expand but that expansion will give you a kind of a confidence in yourself. That we have to take the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga. It's all right; what I get in Sahaja Yoga, what I have achieved in Sahaja Yoga, what is my gain, personal gain in Sahaja Yoga, how I have cured my Chakras. This is one side of achievement and the another side is taking the responsibility. We have to spread Sahaja Yoga all over. So the culture of Sahaja Yoga is to be learned. If you do not have that culture within us, then people are not going to listen to us. As it is, I see your faces shining, I mean, they can see your faces and they say "These are like lotuses, these people are blooming, so beautiful they are." But apart from that, in your personality there should be that magnetism which expresses your responsibility which is the gravity part of it. As the Mother Earth has got gravity, She has got this power of gravity also. So that gravity should be there within us. 


On the whole, if you see Indians as they are, they have many funny, funny type of politicians and also we have lots of kinds of cunning people for ruling us because they are very simple, people are extremely simple and very innocent, so only the cunning can rule such people and such cunning are exploiting these simple people here. 


But that doesn't mean that the people are bad. They are too good and that's why anybody can come on this country and can rule us. In the same way now these - all the muck of the place, all the rakshasas have now become politicians and they are trying to rule this country and the poverty remains at the same level as poverty. There's no concern for the poor people really, because they want to just exploit even that poverty for their own purpose. That whatever may be the situation, there's one thing for sure that these are very simple hearted, very open hearted, loving, affectionate people. And very generous, they have very little to give, but whatever they have they want to give you. And this is specially in Maharashtra, I see this culture is there. Even the poorest of poor will try to contribute something just to make you comfortable, without any grudging, without any grumbling. 


So when we become innocent we should not judge ourselves that if we are innocent we'll be exploited, nobody can exploit a saint, nobody can. If you allow somebody, like I allow people to exploit Me, because I like to play about, they think they are exploiting Me. I said, "All right, I know, I am being exploited." 


So that is also you should see that side, where the humanity is preserved already, they're still preserved, they're not exposed to these ideas of advancement where you can overpower other people economically or politically or try to, sort of, dominate the whole world, even economics can dominate. So they have no sense of that. So, the humanity is still in the same innocent, childlike character here. And exist very well. They're not sick people, they're very healthy - despite all kinds of mosquitoes and bugs and politicians, (Laughter) - all sorts of parasites, but still they exist, happily, always laughing. In the same way, we have to understand that in Sahaj culture we are innocent people. We don't want to harm anyone, we don't want to trouble anyone, we are peaceful people and we are joyous people. We have to enjoy our own personality, and enjoy our collectivity. The sacrifices that we make here is practically nil, I think, but the gain is quite a lot if we develop that witness state within yourself. And that is very, very easily developed in this country, because there's no more any pressures, you see. Like a wheel moves very fast, and the center of the wheel is a quiet center, if you are on your center, then you see the wheel moving, you don't mind. But to immediately - to jump onto that center is difficult, in the West, I see. Because the pressures are too much, the wheel is moving too fast and you cannot take your attention to the center of it, you see. But if you go to a quiet place, where the pressures are not much, of time, or of any such bindings, then gradually the attention moves to the center, that's why people go to Himalayas, where there's peace. In that peace, you can reach your own peace better and if you can establish that peace in your meditation here, then I am sure, you can go back to that fast moving wheel also and you will be on your center. 


So take the full advantage of this tour. Don't worry too much about other things, other comforts that you have in the West, but think of the comfort of the Heart, comfort of the mind and that will really help you a lot. Here, I would say, you should walk about, take a little walking exercises, go about, explore a little bit and see for yourself. This is the reason I am insisting on all these people that, they don't want to stay in the city, take them out of the city, this is a very good chance, because in England even if you go outside, I mean, it's so cold you can't just sit like this, anywhere. Or it may start raining, you have to sit with an umbrella on your head also. But this climate has given us this, this beautiful climate has given this country the possibility of developing inner being more than outer being, because we don't have to fight the nature, the nature is so kind and we can live on a tree here. We don't have to fight to get to the stores for food, no, we can get around here something, [eating ?] well, fruits and things are quite available. So the life becomes much easier here and then people don't think of outside things, but they have to think about inner thing, just automatically. 


You see, when the life is simple, you enter inside and see for yourself, because the inquiry starts, "Why this life, why am I here, what am I supposed to do?" That's why in the beginning I asked you the question to tell Me what is the advantage of this tour. But you jump in the sea or the ocean of joy and you just forget every purpose and that's it. 


Now, the most important thing is that Sahaja Yoga is the greatest event of spiritual world, where all the cosmos, all the Gods and Goddesses and all the Angels and Incarnations and Prophets - all are busy working it out, within you and without. If you could easily reflect My brain back on some screen, you might be able to see them all of them sitting down there and working on you. We have some photographs like that. So the whole of Virata is working behind the stage and you are on the stage. 


So one has to be very careful and alert, that we do not divert our attention into something which is very mundane and very gross. We have to become subtler and subtler here, because other pressures are not here. For example now, I've lived in England and I know what it is anywhere else, there are no servants, there's nobody to look after you, early in the morning whether you are old or young, you have to make your own tea, you have to clean your kitchens, you have to do all the work all the time. That's why, I think, people don't want to have homes also there, because if you have a home, you have to do all this nonsense. So they live in the home somehow for five days and then run away for two days somewhere in a hotel or some place. But here it is very comfortable, you don't have to do any washing, nothing. Now, for example if you have to run your restaurant, you have to work very hard. Here somebody's running for you, you are not doing anything, so there's no Tapasya at all. (Laughter)


But in this all enjoyment and everything that is here, as you see these trees look so nice and happy, but behind that is a great movement of their roots down, going towards the source of life. And that is what, I would say, that you must meditate every morning whenever it is possible for you. Of course, the sleep is much less for you but you can sleep in the buses. I've seen you all were dozing off. (Laughter) I am not surprised, because you must be all very tired and I am also with you all the time and, perhaps, I do much more than you can do, because you may go sleep at two o'clock, but I have to sleep at five o'clock, there's a three hours difference between you and Me. 


But despite that you can feel very fresh, if you can really meditate, it's like a bath - in your innocence, in your beautiful personality. And the whole of tiredness and pressures vanish. Even the dancing is a very good way of clearing out your pressures, because in the dance you go into thoughtless awareness and also in the joy. The joy is so fulfilling, that the joy of Spirit is much more than the joy of any worldly comforts or also of physical comforts. It gives you physical comfort, it gives you mental comfort and it gives you also the spiritual comfort. So try to be more a witness, detached from yourself, watching everything well. This is the purpose of our tour here, is to understand each other, from all the countries we have come here, we are all of the same Mother, we are all brothers and sisters and we are here to enjoy each others company. Then there are other Indians, also you must talk to them, see how they're cooking. The ladies should go and help them if possible, "Let us help, we can do some vegetables for you." Or they are now tying up a - say a pendal here, you can all go and help them. And just become one with them, you should not think that you are guests all the time, - of course you are, they would not like you to do it, though they think your are all guests, special guests, - and even if you do, little bit, even if you ever say that "I would like to carry my cup back", they say, "No, no, no, we'll do it." So that's the idea, Indian idea for guest is, but let us have our western ideas, little bit about guests... (Laughter) Where the guest has to pay for everything... (Laughter) And do all the household work also. (Shri Mataji laughing)


So, the whole working of Sahaja Yoga becomes easier and very much enjoyable if you take responsibilities and have a rapport with the organisers. So I would say, the leaders should meet the organisers when they come here. There are many little, little things they were asking Me that, "How are they going to go for their washings and what are we going to do? What is the date we should appoint for their washing?" So, all these things must be talked over and a rapport must be established about all the problems you have and what we can do about several movements, where do we have to go and how we can organise it, and how we can help it. So sort of there's a proper intermingling and coordination and a rapport between you people and the organisers here, so that there is minimum trouble for you and minimum trouble for them. 


For example, yesterday it was, I told that there will be a man waiting at Veruna, that is a what you call the Ellora Caves, but you had no time to go to Ellora, but just on the way, if you had stopped, there were three people we had put there, stationed that as soon as the buses come here, bring them directly. But you had to spend one hour going that way and one hour coming back, so you can imagine, two hours you would have saved yesterday nicely, but doesn't matter, it has to happen, has to happen. Moreover, when you are going to a place you are carrying vibrations everywhere, you are giving your vibrations and when the people, who see you, - especially the Indian half-baked intellectuals, when they see you, - they start thinking that, "We are still half-baked. How is it: these people have taken to Sahaja Yoga and we are still sitting on our foolish ego thinking that we know much more than anybody else?" 


That has also a very good effect, the way you sang Marathi songs the other day, it really created a great impress on people. Now tonight again there's a public programme. I will be busy with the press and all sorts of things, but you go and enjoy your bath and your swimming in that lake which is nearby here, but don't go too far because maybe in the center, it has rained so much. So they were saying about 55 feet is all right, but maybe there might be lot of mire in the center of that lake, so better keep to the, - what you call the, - shores of it, not too far. And you can have a nice bath there, enjoy your bath and then you can come back here - have your lunch. 


But one thing you have to remember that Indians are very happy, if you eat well, but if you don't eat well, they think they have not made the food well. And that's what they were all the time asking, "I hope they have liked the food, we have hoped they have liked the food." I said, "They are all right, but put less chillies - that's all." (Laughter) But little chillies are very good, because you see of your constitution, I think little chillies will help you, because normally people get constipation, if you don't take chillies. Indians never suffer from this disease, because they have always a little chillies in their food, little chillies all right, then develop a little taste for chillies, is all right, it cleanses you and it has vitamin "C" also in it. So it's quite good for colds and things.   


Now, anybody who wants to drink water, should take it from the proper places and on the way, if you feel thirsty, you should take your own water, of course, but apart from that, if you need, you can just take aerated water, because it has rained so much the water has got very polluted. So don't drink any water anywhere, unless and until you are sure about it, the rest of the food is all done well, so there's nothing to worry, but don't buy anything on the road or anything and eat there, just whatever is cooked for you, I think should be sufficient and enjoy that so that your stomach is kept well and you enjoy the best of your health.


So, MAY GOD BLESS YOU !


So, I would request you - what is this luggage walking in here? (Laughter) It has not been taken down? Should we take it down, because, or is it all right for you, you can go in the same buses down to the lake? Take your clothes and your towels. You need more towels? We have some more towels. I don't know if you have brought them. Have you brought the towels? 


Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, they came. 


Shri Mataji: The rest of them. All right. Because these are good towels, I think, not so bad, they are quite nice absorbent, but you can take this, your buses as they are. But don't go in the buses as if you are Australians or Indians and things like that, get mixed up. Before this -because you arrived from different directions from different countries - we had to arrange buses in that fashion, but I think is better to reorganise, give everybody a criminal number, one, two, three, four, five, six (Shri Mataji laughing - Laughter) and see that they're seated properly and that they have these thing. I think better is to count all of you when you leave the place, nobody is left out here and all the numbers should be there. So I would request all the leaders to come and organise few things and talk to Me about it, about their laundry and there are the new group that has come from Italy, hasn't got yet their saris or anything so far. Now your saris we are carrying with us, but I don't know where they are. Who has carried? 


Sahaja Yogi: In one of the buses, Mother.


Shri Mataji: But there are seven - you know, all right. So, will you please take out that lot and allot it to the ladies who haven't got their saris and kurtas and pyjamas and please collect money from them. I hope you like your kurtas. Are they good? This I thought of, I got this cloth and I think it's very good - also the value is very good. It's very good and this will last and last, because you see, this kind of thing might give way, but because it has got those squares it lasts long. This is also from the same lot you bought? Ah, quite good - eh? 


All right, so I would request you to allot them. Who will do that? The leaders should look after that part. Now who are the people who have come by the last bus? Italy? Italy? Milan. I mean Rome, Milan. Only so few? 


Sahaja Yogi: Twenty seven, Shri Mataji, twenty seven. 


Shri Mataji: Twenty seven but they look like four, five here? Ladies? Very few ladies, is it? 

Sahaja Yogi: The ladies are still in the ladies camp, Mother, up the road.


Shri Mataji: That side?


Sahaja Yogi: Yes.


Shri Mataji: Now, if you want, there are five air conditioned rooms down below, if you want, you can stay there. (Laughters) And one more, one more guest house there, so I said they would love to be here in the open, air conditioning, isn't it? 


Now if somebody wants to go, there is a possibility of five rooms and they kept for Me also, but I said, "I would love to be here." So if you want to go for air conditioning, there are rooms if you want to be comfortable, if somebody's sick or anything, but I think is better to be in the nature.


I would like to tell you about these trees, are called as Neem trees. I don't know if you can pluck them, but you might find them down below. This is what is the very good thing for driving out all the badhas, somehow or other. It has a very bitter taste and the badhas run away from it, but they're very oxygen-creating plants and we use them as toothbrushes. See, there's one twig is taken and chewed into and then we go on cleaning our teeth with it for about an hour or so, you see, (Laughter) while talking to people, early in the morning when they are going for a walk they just take it in their teeth and just go on chewing all of them talking together and sort of working it out. So the teeth can keep very well till the... They never go to dentists, Indians, don't go to dentists. I've never been to a dentist Myself. So this is a very nice thing and here also you get something called Neem toothpaste, I don't know where you can get it, but that's a very good thing for your teeth. So if you could get these trees down, below somewhere, you can pluck it out and you can just start use it for a nice brushing, try, if you can, but you have to chew it very well. So these are, these are the trees, these, this kind, you can see it. And if you have any sort of a scabies or any skin trouble, then we boil the water with this and give a bath. It's very good, for taking a bath, boil the water with this and take a bath. Is a bitter thing, if you don't allow the water to go in your mouth, then it's perfectly all right, it's very good, it's very medicinal thing called as Neem - N-E-E-M - Neem. Try to find, if you can find the toothpaste somewhere - Neem toothpaste or I'll try to get it. 


So, now for the ladies, they can have their saris and their clothes, I hope you like the saris. 


Sahaja Yogini: Beautiful!


Shri Mataji: Are they?  It was a job, I tell you, (Laughters) real Tapasya, and they were so anxious to match every sari with every blouse, you see, it's impossible to get so many colours that they have. And we had to go from places to places, from shops to shops and we had to request all the tailors and so many ladies, and sitting down - imagine, there were, I think, nine hundred and ninety six, I mean, saris and blouses, matched. But they enjoyed it, they very much enjoyed it. 


So, I think we should give them one, these ladies who have worked, three-four ladies, we must give them one sari each. Don't you think so? So in Ganapatipule I'll try to do that. Would you now go and get the saris - somebody. If you can bring the lot here, we can give it to them, they have put the names on every... 


And they have put the names of - also of the boys. There were names of you people? 


Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji. Names and numbers also. 

 
Shri Mataji: Names and numbers, all right. It was really a hard task, I tell you. Baba has done that and he was so sweet, you know, he brought all these things in a vehicle, all the way from Nagpur and I said, "I must pay for it." He said, "No, at least let me do this much favour." I said, "No, you must get something out of it." And I never knew My brother was that good, (Laughter) but as a Sahaja Yogi he's good, excellent.


So two things you have to bear, is food and music. (Laughter) That's the part of it. Tonight we are going to have some sitar. And also some people are going to sing, you people, have to sing some Powada and things in the public program. And then we have decided tomorrow, after the Puja, - because tomorrow you have be ready very quick, for the Puja, they are all going to come down here for the puja and after the Puja you all can go and see Ajanta. And from Ajanta you can come here, sleep here and next day go to Shri Rampur, because Ajanta is this way 110 and Shri Rampur is 110 this way, so you can come in the night and sleep here and next morning we can go to Shri Rampur, the other way. So they are preparing a special Byriani for you there. Here also they are, tonight, they've arrangements for Byriani. 


Any problems, any questions? 


Sahaja Yogi: How could there be, Mother, how could there be?


Shri Mataji: There may be. 


We have tried to reorganise certain marriages again. And where is David is? Where is David? We are still struggling with certain names and perhaps, maybe in Rahuri, we might be able to announce them better, but in Poona most of you will see your fiancees or other people, like some tailors will come to Rahuri, I think, for your silk kurtas and pyjamas and for ladies also, I hope you have given your - have you given your measurements?


Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.


Shri Mataji: And if you really do not want to marry someone, you must tell Me. There's no force in this place, you see. I mean, I am not going to gain anything by you marry - this or that. Why should I force you to marry anyone. There's no logic in it, just I'm trying to help you to adjust, because you were so far away from each other. Just to find out what's your height, what's your education and qualifications, what's your background and all that. Accordingly we tried to arrange something. But if you don't like it just say, "No", plainly: "No". There's no insult or anything, it's not a Divine decision, no. It's something very gross, because I have judged you on your qualifications and everything. So don't think you'll lose your vibrations if you say no (Laughter) - please. Because then I'll feel very hurt, then you see somebody and you know that person, that's why I've given you a chance to know each other, here very well. But if you don't like something just tell Me - frankly. Not to hesitate. You should not be afraid of Me. I don't think, I look that horrible. (Laughter)


All right. So, I would say that you people had your bath and all that or you want to go out? We could sit down, you will be all right, we can just sit down for a while and I may join you after some time, maybe, but these press people might be on my head, or they would be here. So I'm waiting for the Press people to come. 


Try to come back as soon as possible and the saris, those who haven't got the saris, can stay back, otherwise you all can go in the buses - all right? Let's, where should - why not come to My side to get the saris - all right? It's better that side. 


The sun is not very hot, it's quite mild, I think.
