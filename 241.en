Sahasrara Day Puja, evening before, "Nirvikalpa". Vienna, May 4, 1985.

It is gratifying to see so many Sahaja Yogis have come to celebrate the Sahasrara Day. Without breaking the Sahasrara, we could not have achieved the ascent en masse. But the Sahasrara which is the brain has gone into too much complications in the west. And the thoughts are very much twisted, one upon the other. To keep Sahasrara open should be very easy if the Western brains could understand and be aware about your Mother. When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrara, the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrara open has to be complete surrendering.

For that many ask me, How do we do it ? It's a very funny question. It is irrelevant. If your Sahasrara has been opened out by someone, and luckily that is the Deity before you, it should be the easiest thing to surrender. But it is not. It is difficult because the attention that has come up through the cells of the brain expressing itself through the cells of the brain is polluted. It is impure. It is destructive. It's poisonous and when the nerves are spoiled, the light of the Spirit does not shine on the nerves. And you feel the inability to surrender. Normally, it should be the easiest thing to do.

So we have to mentally approach ourselves. We have to talk to ourselves and say to ourselves "What are you doing? What is surrendering? It is enjoyment, it is just enjoyment, Then why I cannot surrender? What is lacking in me? AM I a very low level person? Am I the one who was just saying I'm a seeker but I'm not. Am I dishonest person that I cannot surrender? If so, what am I proud of? Myself? If that is the situation, then why am I so much enamoured by my ego?"

What do you have to surrender? A drop has to dissolve into the Ocean to become the Ocean, and a drop cannot be greater than the Ocean, can it be? So what is the surrendering? Surrendering of our conditionings, of our ego and the artificial barriers we have built around us.

One can approach mentally, one can approach emotionally and also physically we can approach ourselves. We can approach ourselves through mantras, through seeing ourselves, through knowing ourselves. But one should know this is the greatest of greatest opportunity for you, not for the Divine, If you are not available the Diving can find its own ways of fulfilling its last culmination of expression. Even to understand how immense the task is, you need a surrendering heart.

Only through mental approach when you arrive, you develop a petty ego that you are doing a great work. Like I telephoned to America saying that I'll be coming. There's a very big scientist in Los Angeles who is an Indian Maharashtrian fellow. He missed his Nobel prize, such a great scientist. He telephoned to me immediately saying "Mother I am coming to New York to receive you. I'm taking leave for fifteen days. When you are here I want to be with you. What else is to be done? As it is I am doing Sahaja Yoga by-the-way at my own convenience, when ever I get time. Thats what Im doing, isn't it? But I would like to travel with you to Europe to all the different places with you to spend some time, otherwise, what am I doing here?"

But what I have heard, that people are arriving at different times for Sahasrara Day. I was amazed. It's typical western mind. By the way, Sahaja Yoga is to be done, mostly by-the-way. It should be convenient. It should be a weekend. When just by-the-way for a holiday, we can go to Vienna. There, of course, by-the-way, we'll have a puja and by-the-way Mother will raise the Kundalini. She will awaken our Deities and then by-the way we'll be enjoying the blessings. No sacrifice can be done for God. No time, they have no time. Everything is by-the-way. It's rather amazing, for war people give up their lives, for destruction they work so hard, day and night. But for construction of humanity for the ultimate goal of Divinity, in the West, how many there are who really surrender? If it suits, then we'll be there. Sahaja, this is Sahaja style. We should reach Sahaja. I heard about this many a times. There are still many who take that kind of an attitude towards Sahaja Yoga. It is sometimes surprising for me.

If I go to a village, people take leave for fifteen days, one month. In Rahuri people take leave for one month to prepare for my coming. One day leave for them is a very big thing. they are the people who deserve. It's not what you dress and what you eat and what you have. It's what you can give and give up. The tags of mundane life are to be cut off. You must understand. It's a progress of people like slaves tied up to chains, chains of desires, of complacentness, chains of lethargy, chains.... When I say this, I find suddenly the ego coming up automatically. On the contrary, to surrender to fill up your vessel with the bliss, the bliss of Divinity, so that when you go to others you pour on them the beauty and love of God. It is for you to understand yourself very well and not others. Don't blame anyone.

It's so precious that no words can describe the greatness of these moments which we are spending together. You have to feel it within yourself, the assignment that is given to you through your own Spirit, through your own state. You can fulfil the assignment. But lack of faith in yourself cannot give you surrendering powers. Surrender is the opening of Sahasrara, keeping it completely open so that Nirvikalpa state is established within us. There should be a regular progress of improvement, regular progress of the opening. Have you ever seen any lotus or any flower that blooms , blooms , and in between again does not bloom and then blooms then collapses then blooms. Have you ever seen such a nonsensical phenomenon in the nature ? You come up, again you go down, again you come up, you go down. Have you ever seen a tree that comes up, again goes inside the mud, again it comes up, again it goes back into the mud, blaming other people. Have you seen any animal which started growing, then it becomes a dwarf, again it grows, again it becomes a dwarf.

Even these huge palaces which have been built so beautifully for us. Do you see that they become small suddenly and then collapse and then again they blow up. Only balloons of ego and super-ego does that. And when you are identified with that, you, too become very peculiar personalities. The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now. It must open more and more and more and should not suddenly collapse, again open, again collapse. It's a very complicated phenomenon. You can see in the west and you can be very much surprised sometimes. To me it's sometimes very shocking to see. Suddenly someone will come "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing, I'm very nervous about that. Another person will come and tell me "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now". Another one comes and tells me "Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it". So we must realize that there is something very peculiar within us, something absurd within us, that's why it happens. We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards, al I the time. What is this pendulum? That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum. It is a lotus. So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention. The attention that moves from left to right, right to left, goes on like that all the time.

But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God, When the Brahmarandhra opens fully, then the heavens open within yourself. The Kundalini which has risen up and given you realization creates that subtle opening, by     which the Divine starts pouring    all    its subtleties inside your brain. But if you're pressing it from both sides    with    these balloons, sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening, the Divine recedes its attention. You must know that. The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times, the Divine doesn't bother. So it is you who has to achieve that state and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa. In that there is just progression. After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down. If somebody Is still going up and down, up and down, he should know he is still not up to the point and he should face up to himself and tell himself or herself that "No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa where I do not come down".

The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that. They are not going to be saved. They will be punished. May not be the same way (as) those who are not realized souls, but they will not occupy the seats in the realm of God Almighty. At least you , must reach the state of Nirvikalpa. Do not -blame any circumstance. Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that. There's no need to blame anyone, "Because somebody came we were influenced". What is the matter with you? I'm here , you are not influenced by me. How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid obviously, so dominating? That means what is your level ? So tomorrow I have decided to tell you how to be at the state of Nirvikalpa. As I said, we can approach mentally. j But mentally I say you take this medicine and you do not take the medicine; that is just a mental thing. The medicine is kept on the cupboard. You are just the same and then you say "Mother, yes we listened to your lecture".

So the keynote of tomorrow's Pooja as I have decided that you have to be at the Nirvikalpa state. You can say this Sahasrara day is a very big day because I never threw such an ultimatum before. Because now we are established as Vishva Dharma, as the Universal Religion. We are not like other religions where, after the deaths of the incarnation, people started the religion and did whatever they wanted to do with that. In our living time we are going to make ourselves that instrument which will represent the Vishva Dharma. We have to have strong Deities within ourselves. We have weakened them by all our mistakes. Doesnt matter.

They are weak because traditionally we haven't got the strength. Doesn't matter. But now this Religion has been established. We cannot have black spots any more. We've done all the choosing, the training, everything. And you all have to jump into the boat now. Theres no more time left for us to dilly-dally. Those who will be left behind will be left behind. It's a very intense period now, you must understand. The intensity of the period is not by-the-way. It's. not any more Sahaja Yoga. It is Maha Yoga now. And you have to become Maha, you have to become great, otherwise you cannot be there. You have to jump out of all these things.

Tomorrow I'll try whatever is possible on my side. I'll work it out. There is a serious matter. I must tell you that once I've established the Religion I don't want to have any holes in it. I avoided it because I was not sure. Now I know for sure that there are many who could be called as Nirmalites. Because no more black spots on the beautiful sari of your Mother. It has to be absolutely highest quality. Gradually we used to drop people, gradually worked out this. There's no time left now. As I have told you I'm going back to India. Tomorrow I'll be able to tell you * how gradually you have got up to your Sahasrara and to get to Nirvikalpa you have to really dedicate yourself fully.

It's not a matter of convenience to come to Sahaja Yoga. It's a Sahasrara Day. You have to cross the Himalayas. If you read the lives of the people who tried to travel up to Kailasha, you will know what hardships they have gone through. I've taken you very sweetly, delicately up to that point, but don't get spoiled by that. You'll all fizzle out into thin air unless and until you are in the Nirvikalpa state.

I'm sorry I have to say that here, in Austria. This is the place which should demarcate the end of our journey to left and right. Because "my husband is like that"-"my wife is like that"-.,,because my child is like this"-you are not going to be excused. Whom are you telling-your own Spirit ? Tell your Spirit. Does it understand? It takes away your vibrations, it takes away your joy, it takes away your position. Nirvichara is very easy to establish. But that alto some people have not. What about Nirvikalpa? You have to take it up very seriously.

This may be the last Sahasrara day we are celebrating in Europe, maybe, I don't know. It's not that Mother is only happy if there are people of higher qualification or higher calibre. It's not that. I have very great concern for those who are lost, who are left out. But sometimes through my experience I think such people get spoilt. My love is not far spoiling you, is not ruining you. It is for your emancipation. Is for you to enjoy the beauty of God's blessings on you. Even now if there are people who are not righteous who are not truthful, who are not virtuous at the dharma stage, then what can I talk to them? And then if they are not even the Spirit, then what am I to do with them?

The ideologies, the talking, the discussion and arguments do not lead you there. No they do not. It's meditation. What is meditation? Is actually facing yourself and correcting yourself with the full understanding as to what you are. We have to create ideal human beings. That is what is the Vishva Dharma, otherwise we have many adharmas going on. So many religious activities in the name of all the great incarnations, which are nowhere near the incarnation, just the opposite of it.
This Nirvikalpa state has to be established once and for all, so I don't have to then struggle with you. The group of people who'll attend tomorrow's Sahasrara should be able to establish that state-otherwise they are just like the People who are newcomers. They are coming for the first time, or ten times, or eleven times, or hundred times. What difference does it make? To me it is clear cut. I have short time, because the instrument has to be alright. If you have to expedite the growth of the instrument in a proper way so that the God of Love, God's Love flows and the God of that Love feels happy about it. We have to create such beautiful flowers that He appreciates, that He does not destroy. The spectator of this play has to be satisfied so that He postpones His destruction. That's why I said the time is short, time is very short.

If we want our children to grow into the realm of God, they are great saints who are born, if you want to give them a full chance of the enjoyment, then let us first of all become proper parents and not people who just live with illusions. Everything in Sahaja Yoga cannot be explained. I cannot explain. I cannot because you don't have those powers to understand.

Like a girl said "Mother I want to have the sun." Because people told her "The weekend will be terrible. There won't be any sun." Within fifteen minutes, the sun was shining. Within fifteen minutes. The wind started blowing, all the clouds settled around Vienna, beautifully like the Sahasrara and the sky opened as I want your Sahasrara to be open. All the nature is so anxious to work it out. But you must learn to cooperate with your Spirit. It's not a co-operation that is just by the way. It is to be the Spirit, the becoming of the Spirit fully. Is very important. Nothing should stop that.

I hope today's announcement will help all of us to have that understanding of our responsibilities towards ourselves and towards our Creator. It's nice to praise me for my love. It's nice to praise me for whatever has happened, but to be very frank, I do not know if you are praising me. I do not feet tile praise because I myself I am not myself. I see myself as separate and then I tell myself that "See, you are Adi Shakti alright, but you have spoilt your children, you have not done full justice to them. They take everything so easy and mundane."

So you have to tomorrow take a vow within your heart. It's not the words that are important. It has to be living action of your being. That should prove it, that should convince you that we are fully surrendered. And the effects of that you will feel in your own personality, in your own being, in your own manifestation.

With so many Saints, why should I have any worry of spreading of Sahaja Yoga? Because there are some who drag you down, there are some adamant people and there are some still who are possessed, there are some who are murmuring souls. Just don't pay any attention to them. Theyll be all lost. Doesn't matter.

We have to create the great day for us to be proud that we belong to this great religion of truth. There has been no religion so far which is the Religion of Truth. It practices something and preaches something and it has nothing to do with the incarnation. You have to do something that people should say we can see our Mother in this person.

Today is the day when I want to bless some children. I've blessed many children. I would like to bless all the parents also to understand that they have to contribute a lot for the up-bringing of the children. There have been some very good tapes they have made in England, how to help the children to grow properly in this crazy western life. And the one who has been the greatest enemy of yours worked in this place. He's the one who has ruined you and you had to commit sin against the Holy Ghost. Sin against your Mother, Now at this time in this place we have to turn our face to hope it will work out.

But just think in your mind what have we sacrificed so far? No sacrifice is sufficient. But have we sacrificed anything? That will make you understand that your Mother has given you your second birth without any difficulties. She has taken up all the labour pains upon Herself. Now you are grown up and you have to understand that now you are grown up people and you can't behave like children. That is over now. Now you are grown up people, you have to become responsible for this Maha Yoga and for this great Dharma that we have established. The Dharma that integrates all the Dharmas. The Dharma that purifies anybody who comes near. It's the Ocean of all the rivers. All the rivers flow to this great Ocean of Vishva Dharma.

So we have to mould ourselves to fit into the new pattern, the new rhythm, the new music of Divine flute. Unless and until that happens, I do not think that western people have much chance. If you have come for Sahasrara, be prepared. Tomorrow I would like to work out as much as possible.

I'm working 24 hours. Not a single minute I waste. And in the same way I hope you will dedicate your 24 hours for your emancipation and the emancipation of the whole universe.

May God bless you all
