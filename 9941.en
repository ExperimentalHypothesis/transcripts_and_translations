KUNDALINI PUJA, Date: 5th Feb. 1990, Place: Hyderabad, Type: Puja, Speech: Hindi, Translated to: English

It is such a joy
to meet you all. And, I had not even imagined that there would be so
many Sahaja Yogis in Hyderabad. There is a unique quality of
Hyderabad that diverse set of people have gelled together. This is
quite similar to our Nagpur. I have seen that different people from
across India have settled in Nagpur. That is why people there have an
openness for sacraments. The way they see each other is quite
acceptive too. Now if we all have to turn towards Sahaja Yoga in a
novel way, then we must learn about several things that Sahaja Yoga
is a form of truth (Satya Swaroop) and we are honest
(Satyanishth). Whatever is false, we must give it up. At
times, getting rid of falsehood becomes very difficult. Because when
we are associated with something that is false for too long, it
becomes difficult how to disassociate from it. But, if the falsehood
continues to be glued to us, we can never become pure. Because
falsehood is illusionary and we should resolve to fight that
illusion, that whatever is the truth we will accept it and will get
rid of whatever is false. With this resolve itself, you will be
amazed, that the Kundalini within you, which is awakened, will do
this for you and will bring forth such circumstances in front of you
that you will be able to distinguish what is truth and what is false.
Not just this, you will get that power, that you will have the desire
to achieve the truth only and whatever falsehood you will see, you
will give it up. 

Now so many things that you are told in Sahaja Yoga, are told after much thoughtful consideration, and, after reflecting upon your sacraments, and are told in such a way, so that you don’t get upset. But despite such explanation, at times you might think this thing is not right, that thing is not right. The things written in many scriptures are mostly true. But, in some places it is seen that lot of wrong notions start flourishing, and because of these wrong notions we have started believing them to be true.

Like it has been
written in the Gyaaneshwari, that when the kundalini is
awakened you start floating in the air and you start walking on
water, and, you can see far off things beyond even the seven seas.
Now this is indecipherable. Because Gyaaneshwar ji was a
saint, a great saint. We people must think about it, that saints came
to this world for people’s welfare (jan hitaay) and joy (jan
sukhaay). What joy will they give to people by teaching them
about such things? What comfort will you get, if you will start
floating in air, does that make you special? Or if you start walking
on water, do you become special? But the thing that actually benefits
us, that is the inner transformation and establishing our
relationship with the Almighty. But, in that same Gyaaneshwari
it is written, in Pasayadan (the nine ending verses of
the Gyaaneshwari), he says that now the souls of the world are
universal and must be happy. Because I have done penance of
utterance, and must give such Pasayadan, give such vibrations
so that the whole world is transformed. And the entire focus should
be on transformation. Then this should be understood that the
previous things have been included in it by someone else. Because
Gyaaneshwar ji could never write such a thing, that you will
float in air, walk on water. What benefits will people get from
these! Any which way, we are flying in air, sailing by ships, and
watching everything on Doordarshan (the public service
broadcaster in India). So, why is the Kundalini needed
for all this?

So, the work to
be done by of Kundalini must be understood and the way we read
all the scriptures, so in this we must think whether these thoughts
hold onto the truth or not. For this reason, even in the Gita, and
in most religious scriptures wrong ideas have been written. For
example, it is written in the Gita, the caste in which you are
born becomes your caste. This can never happen. Because who wrote the
Gita? Who was he? Vyaas. And, do you know whose son was Vyaas?
Of a woman of the Dheewar caste? Son of a fisherwoman who
wasn’t even married. Son of such a woman, was Vyaas. How will he
write such a thing, that the caste of your birth, will become your
caste. But it has been said, “Ya Devi SarvaBhuteshu, Jaatirupen
Sansthita”, it meansevery individual’s caste resides
within him.

The meaning of
caste (Jaati) is, what is born with us, is innate, a type of
tendency within us, an aptitude, what is our inclination towards,
what are we entangled in. There are many people who are seeking
money. There are many others who are seeking power and authority.
But, there are many people who are seeking God. Someone’s caste
means his inclination, his aptitude and the innate tendencies. This
means that only those people will take to Sahaja Yoga, who are
seeking God, who think of Brahma, and, who pay attention to
achieving the Supreme (Param) and realize there is nothing to
be gained from worldly materialism.

Initially, only such people will come. First of all, only such people will come who actually think of how to find God. That we should know God or be one with this Spirit. People who think like this, by whichever means, by reading any book, or by staying with saints and sages, by being with a guru, such people come to Sahaja Yoga, first. That is why you will see that Sahaja Yoga grows slowly. All other things grow like plastic. You can find thousands of people running behind a guru. But they leave them because they get no benefit. They give them money, somehow, they may be corrected too. But, we must think that whatever is the truth, what is a living thing, it nurtures very slowly. It can’t grow rapidly. If a tree has to blossom, initially only one-two flowers will bloom, then four five flowers will bloom and gradually lot of flowers will bloom. So, when a person is inclined towards Sahaja Yoga and he takes to it, sometimes he may get very upset as to why Sahaja Yoga grows so sluggishly. Why is Sahaja Yoga’s progress so slow? So now you have understood the reason for this, that Sahaja Yoga is a living process and we can’t force it upon anyone. If we tell someone you are now realized, they can’t be. It has to happen. Unless this happens, unless someone gets their realization, we can’t say they have achieved it.

For example,
there was a lady with us, she went to America. Her son came from
Honolulu, so she told me, “please give him self-realization”. I
told her, “he is unable to get it, what can I do. You give him the
realization”. So, then she said, “if you can’t do it, how can
I?” I said, “should we give a false certificate that he has got
his realization”. She said, “how will that be of any good”. I
said, “that is it”. Therefore, this has to happen, and this form
of truth (Satya Swaroop) must be achieved. If this doesn’t
happen and somebody falsely claims I am realized now, have got it.
And, all people got their realization, even this can’t be said.
Many people don’t get their realization for multiple reasons. At
times, some people think how can this happen. Most people think, when
this has never happened before, so much penance was required, people
had to go to the Himalayas, all this had to be done, so how is it
possible that we can get it now. Actually, if we tell someone there
is a diamond kept here and you can get it for free then everybody
will run for it. No one will leave it. But, if we tell them, your
Kundalini can be awakened effortlessly, easily, and, without paying a
penny, then people won’t believe it. Because in their
self-confidence they can’t understand what these times are. What
are these special times that such a thing can happen? So, what we
should think is, we are in unique circumstances. We haven’t
practiced about kundalini, we haven’t read or written about it, and
it is still awakened within us. And, now that it is awakened and we
have got our self-realization, we must understand that all this work
now, we aren’t doing it. This is the all-pervading divine energy
(Param Chaitanya) that has created this universe, we must
achieve oneness with this all-pervading divine energy. And it is the
play of this all-pervading divine energy which is doing all our work.
So, we are not doing anything. We are just standing inactively.

For example,
today this microphone has connection. It is connected to the mains so
whatever I am saying is audible. It is being used. Similarly, when we
are connected with that all-pervading universal love of the Almighty,
with that all-pervading divine energy, then we need not worry about
anything. He takes care of all our concerns. Even then, when a person
comes to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning he thinks let’s do this and
let’s do that as well. He argues and counter-argues. He thinks this
will solve my purpose. This should happen, and, is constantly anxious
about things. But, gradually he understands I can’t do anything.
But, if think, “let me try doing this” then God also says, “okay,
you do what you want to do”. That is called alpdhaarisht. An
alpdhaarisht, he sees that you are alpdhaarisht, let’sdo this. But, gradually you get absolute faith that the
all-pervading divine is doing everything. The all-pervading divine
energy overlooks everything, and, does everything. This should be
accepted. It shouldn’t be questioned “why is it like this?” 

Now I’ll tell you that sometimes if I forget some route and take up another route, I tell myself taking which route was important. That is why I forgot the route and have taken up this one. Then some may wonder why did this happen. It should not have happened like this. Sometimes we do not understand a lot of things. After many days we realize that it was important and hence it happened in this way. Then we feel assured about it and understand that everything was said in such a beautiful manner. So, if something does not happen to our liking, we should not conclude that God didn’t help us. God did help us, but our desire was inappropriate. Therefore, whatever was good for us God did for us. Because we can’t think better than God. We can’t do anything more than what this Param Chaitanya can do. That is why whatever He has done for us, whatever arrangements He has made for us, whatever He is doing for us, and, whatever is happening, it is all extremely beautiful. It all happens effortlessly, in a very Sahaja manner.

I
feel very joyous to see so many Sahaja Yogis in Hyderabad. Now in
Sahaja Yoga, there are two parts, I must say it is important to
balance these two parts. One part is, you should meditate. At home,
it is important to meditate at an individual level. And must work on
removing our flaws. Our process of meditation is very simple and easy
(Sahaja). In mornings and evenings, you must sit for
meditation for 10-15 minutes. First introspect yourself and look for
your flaws within. Many a times people don’t understand that
whether they are left sided or right sided and start doing the wrong
treatments. So, first we must understand our state. Which of our
chakras is catching? Where are we? We can know all these
things. When you meditate in front of the photograph you will come to
know whether this chakra is catching or that chakra is catching. Try
to understand it completely with the complete knowledge and try to
assimilate within (aatmsaat). After solving it, it becomes
personal. Then you should join the collectivity. When you join the
collectivity, you must know that you must open your heart. Any person
without an open heart, cannot enjoy the collectivity. Many people
have become very narrow-minded. Reason being, they don’t realize
how beautiful the world is and how much better we can make it.
Someone who hasn’t witnessed a beautiful arrangement, who hasn’t
witnessed a beautiful world, they can’t believe that this could be
a real world. So, they are confined to themselves and another thing
is, when we start looking at other people, we see their faults first.
When we start seeing faults in other people, then we gather more
faults within. But if we see their qualities, their virtues, their
beauty, then we also imbibe their beauty and their faults disappear.
When there is no one else, and they are part and parcel of our own
body, then what is benefit of seeing their faults. These faults must
be removed. The best way to remove one’s fault is through love.
Because our whole work is based on the power of love, and, love is
truth and truth is love. One who will use the power of love will
attain great heights. We should open our heart and then see others
with love. In this way it becomes your own part, where you progress
individually and when you are friendly and love others you progress
in collectivity. Those who are not friendly with others should
understand that they are not Sahaja. Someone who raises lot of
questions that might pain others, that may cease mutual love, that
may ignite clashes, such a person is not Sahaja and one must stay
away from such people. Such kind of person is like a rotten mango
that can spoil all other mangoes. Such people always gossip about
others and speak against someone or the other. Therefore, it is
sinful in Sahaja Yoga to hear condemnations against other Sahaja
Yogis. Because if we hear such things our ears will be damaged. And
because of this, you can say in a way, we start developing bad
opinion about him. 

When dealing with others, we must see how much dignity we hold inside. How much we can forgive and with how much love we can speak with them. How much closer we can bring them because these people are our real relatives. You know well how the other relationships are. True relationships are, what we have in Sahaja Yoga and you must know that you have brothers and sisters in forty other countries. And whenever you will meet them you will be overjoyed.

 
 In the second state, you have to love and spread Sahaja
Yoga. This is also very important, especially for ladies, for women
because they are the manifestation of power, the ‘Shakti
Swaroopnee’. They should know which chakra is catching, which
toe finger is catching. How it can be rectified. What is the flaw in
it? What diseases can occur because of this? How can we cure people?
Through the faults how can we know which chakra is catching? How can
this be cured? All other knowledge, the knowledge of kundalini. Sit
down, think, recall and know all these things. But after coming in
Sahaja Yoga, many people don’t pay attention to these things. They
have no knowledge and continue practicing Sahaja Yoga. So, having
knowledge about it, is very important. Many children are born as
realized souls, as Sahajis. But they have no knowledge about Sahaja
Yoga. So, it is the responsibility of the mother to know about
Sahaja. In this way, they will not only understand their children but
will also understand that a child who is born in Sahaja why is he
behaving in a particular way. What is the matter with him? To
understand this, knowledge about it is very important. Those who do
not have knowledge about it they don’t understand what they are
talking about. What are they doing? Others will have no influence
of it. So, it is very important to have knowledge about this. 

And the fourth most important thing is spreading Sahaja Yoga. If you are sitting in a room and one door is open, you are getting air through it. But if the other door is closed then there will be no circulation of air, the flow of air will stop. In the same way, when we introduce others to Sahaja Yoga, help them, give them realization, propagate it and talk about it. We talk to our relatives about this, invite them to our homes over tea and give them Sahaja Yoga. Unless and until we spread Sahaja Yoga, we will not make any progress. Because you know, as the tree grows, its branches must also grow, and, it should be able to give shade to people sitting underneath it. Otherwise there are many other trees, but we are like Banyan trees, so we should assist completely to spread it. We should do all the things required for this. We should turn towards it. We should be completely surrendered towards Sahaja Yoga and all our time should be devoted to what can we do or give for Sahaja Yoga. You know we don’t take money in Sahaja Yoga. But, like I have heard, if you have to conduct a public program, all the money is given by Mr. Nagrao, this is not good. Starting now, you should start collecting small amount of money and when I come everyone should contribute in it with all their body, soul, money and in all possible ways. And, you will enjoy this. Anyways we keep collecting, we buy this, we buy that. Don’t buy something new and rather think it is kept for Sahaja Yoga. There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are always thinking about Sahaja Yoga. They think that this will transform the whole society, the whole universe. This will establish a kingdom of joy in the whole world and we will all live blissfully. And whatever has been said about heavens, will transpire in this world. And people think that we should whole-heartedly be involved in this divine and great work. But such type people who are in Sahaja Yoga, hold high ranks and have achieved a great state. They will feel joyous that they are in Sahaja Yoga. Their business does good. They keep earning money. They leave behind all the doubts. All their problems are solved. They don’t understand how there are no more problems. This problem is solved, that problem is solved. Everything is going fine.

So, if we get
awakened like this and we step into the realm of truth, then we can
see for ourselves how much fundamentalism and wrong sacraments exist
within us for so long and are so deeply ingrained. And we cannot make
progress because of these. Whatever we may have been thinking before
taking to Sahaja Yoga, whatever our parents might have told us,
whatever our society would have taught us, we have a huge
responsibility that we should create such a society that it is pure,
immaculate (Nirmal), and, in that pure and Nirmal we
should hold our faith and must establish ourselves in that dharma.

May you be showered with immense blessings!
