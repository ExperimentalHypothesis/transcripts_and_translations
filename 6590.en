Public Program. CA-Tent, Vienna (Austria), 5 August 1991.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. 

At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it, we cannot change it, it is beyond human awareness. That means, at human awareness we cannot know the absolute truth. This is the reason why we have different theories which go against each other and we fight. Absolut truth can only be known if you become a higher person. That you have to become the Spirit. This is the fundamental truth about you that you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego, nor your conditionings but you are the Spirit. Unless and until you become absolute you cannot understand the absolute. This second truth is that there is a subtle all-pervading power around us which does all living work. We see these beautiful flowers here, we see them, we take them for granted. They have come out of a small little seed differently. How it happens, we don't think. Look at our eyes, what a beautiful micro-camera it is, but we just take it for granted. We have also taken our evolution for granted, from amoeba stage to this human stage. Unless and until we human beings find out the truth through this evolutionary process of becoming the Spirit, none of our problems are going to be solved. And it is very easy. Sahaja means "born with you". And Yoga means, is the union with this all-pervading power. This is done through a residual power within us, as you can see here, in the triangular bone, of sacrum. This bone was called as "sacrum" by Greeks, meaning the Greeks knew it's a sacred bone. This instrument exists within us and is just waiting to be triggered. And when She rises She passes through six subtle centers, ultimately piercing through the fontanel bone area giving you the actualization of baptism. 

It is the actualization, it is not some sort of a brand. And then your growth starts because there is Divinity within you. With this growth you are amazed that physically, mentally, emotionally all your problems are solved. Spiritually, people talk of many things but it is just talk, but is not reality. Unless and until you had the experience of this all-pervading power it is just a talk. And unless and until you are connected to this all-pervading power, your life has no meaning. Gradually, we are living like robots, without any joy, without any love. So, the first experience you get is that you become thoughtlessly aware, meaning you watch something, you just enjoy it but you don't think about it, don't react. And the second state is, we call it as "doubtless awareness". At this state you yourself develop the power to raise the Kundalini of others, curing others, and knowing about your centers, that is self-knowledge, and knowing about others' centers, which is collective consciousness. Thus, you enter into a new awareness. When the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area you start feeling a cool breeze in your hand. These are gentle cool vibrations which are the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, or this all-pervading power. But when you get to this stage that you become the Spirit you become extremely peaceful. Like a wheel which is moving, and if your attention is on the wheel, on the periphery, then your mind is all the time moving. But if you jump on the axis of the wheel it is silent. So, you enter into the area of complete silence and from there you see everything as a drama, a play. Spontaneously all these things happen to you. You are already built in that way. 

Today, I am sorry, the musicians arrived very late because they were stopped at the border and the whole thing has taken so much time. But it is all built-in within you as all these electrical bulbs are here. If you have to put on the light you have to just press the button. But supposing I have to tell you all about these lights, and electricity invention, it's a headache. The best thing is first to get your enlightenment. For this enlightenment you cannot pay because it is the last break-through of your evolution. It is a living process. As you do not pay anything to the Mother Earth you cannot pay to Sahaja Yoga. When we sow the seed, there is built-in quality in the Mother Earth to sprout. And also, there is a built-in quality in the seed to sprout as well as in the Mother Earth. In the same way you have built-in this instrument which works out your spontaneous Self-Realization. So today, as we have done a little more time, so I would request you to ask Me some questions and tomorrow I'll tell you what is Self-Realization and what is Self. You can ask Me some questions and I can answer them but I have to tell you that this is all mental acrobat. I am not come here to take anything from you but to give you what is your own. So please if you can ask Me a few questions and then we can have the session of Self-Realization, which will take hardly fifteen minutes. 

Such great seekers of truth! 

So, as you have no questions we could have the session of Self-Realization. First thing I have to tell you that it is a living process and nobody can be forced. If you have a pure honest desire to get your Self-Realization then it will work out spontaneously. Please have full confidence in yourself! 

Now, there are three conditions before we start. First, as I said, you must have full confidence in yourself. The second is, you should not feel guilty at all about anything, whatever has happened in the past. Because we are all human beings, and if we have committed mistakes it's all right. You are not God. So, to feel guilty is absolutely of no use. On the contrary, if you feel guilty then the center on the left-hand side here catches very badly. And this is a very dangerous thing that happens. With this catch you develop a disease called angina, and also spondylitis, and also the left-side organs become lethargic. So, please forget the past at this moment, you have to be in the present! The third condition is very simple but people think it is difficult. The third condition is that you should forgive everyone without thinking about them individually. Many people say, "It is very difficult to forgive." Whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. Logically, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself unnecessarily while the person who has troubled you is living happily. So, if you just say, "I forgive everyone in general", don't think of them, immediately you will feel very much lighter. So we must have respect for ourselves because we have no ideas to how glorious we are inside, that there is Divinity within all of us which has to manifest to give us joy, it's all waiting there. So please, forgive everyone - without thinking about them!

Now, we have to take out our shoes to take the help from Mother Earth. Put your both the feet away from each other as these are two powers. Left power is the power of desire, and the right one is the power of action. So, we have to put our left hand like this towards Me, symbolic that we desire to have Self-Realization. We have to use our right hand for nourishing our centers on the left hand side. First we put our right hand to our heart. 

Aside:"Somebody should show."

First I will show you, and then we will close our eyes. Here resides the Spirit. If you are the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit you become your guide. So you become your own master. So now, take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery. Now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge. Then, you raise your right hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen. Then again on your heart. Now, between the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right fully. This is the center which I have told you goes out of order when you feel guilty. So now, you have to raise your hand on your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now, please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading Divine power. Now, please stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your head, on top of the fontanel bone area. Now, please put down your head as far as possible. Now, please push back your fingers, please do this, push back your fingers otherwise there won't be proper pressure. And now move your scalp seven times clock-wise, slowly. Push back your fingers, put down your head! 

That's all we have to do.

Now, remember you have to take out your shoes, put both the feet apart from each other. Please put left hand towards Me. And the right hand on your heart. You can take out your spectacles because now we have to close our eyes and unless and until I tell you you are not to open the eyes. Those who do not want to have their Self-Realization must leave the hall because it is not civil to disturb others. Now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you! With the hand on your heart you have to ask a very fundamental question to Me. You can call Me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji". So ask this question: "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this three times. 

If you are the Spirit you are your master. 

Shri Mataji says to the translator: "Little loudly - loudly."

So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. And here you have to ask another fundamental question three times: "Mother, am I my own Master?" 

I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and here you ask for pure knowledge, because I cannot force on you. So please say six times because there are six petals: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge!" As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to open the higher centers with our full self-confidence. So, please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and with full confidence say ten times: "Mother, I am my own Master!" 

I've already told you that the fundamental truth about you is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, these conditionings but you are pure Spirit. So now, raise your right hand on your heart and with full confidence say twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit." 

This all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of absolute knowledge. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever wrong you may do, this ocean of forgiveness has the power to dissolve it. So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here, with full confidence, you have to say: "Mother, I am not guilty at all!", sixteen times. 

I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So please forgive, because this center is extremely subtle, so please forgive everyone in general without thinking about them individually. Now, raise your right hand on your forehead and put it down. Put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, with full confidence: "Mother, I forgive everyone!" 

Now, take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading Divine power. So again say with your heart, not how many times, please say: "Oh Divine power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me!" 

Now the last center is important, so you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area. Now put down your head as far as possible. Now, push back your fingers, this is very important, push back your fingers and press your scalp. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom and I cannot force Self-Realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now, please move your right hand with a pressure on your scalp, move your scalp seven times clock-wise saying, seven times: "Mother, please give me my Self-Realization!" 

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is blowing into the microphone.

Please take down your hands and open your eyes. Put both the hands like this. Now, put down your head and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. 

Shri Mataji says to the translator: "Loudly, loudly!" 

But don't put the hand on your head but away from it and see for yourself, sometimes it comes very much far away. Now, put the left hand towards Me. Now again put down your head and see for yourself with the right hand. Now, again please put the right hand and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your head. If you have not forgiven then it will be hot breeze, so please forgive, even now. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head, and ask a question three times, anyone of these questions: "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or, "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God's love?" or, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions three times. 

Now, please take down your hands. Please put your hands towards Me like this and watch Me without thinking. Now, those who felt cool breeze or hot breeze on their hands or fingertips or out of their fontanel bone please raise both your hands. 

I bow to you all Saints, the whole of Austria will get one day Self-Realization if we move like this. Now, don't discuss it, don't argue it out, because it is beyond the mental side. Tomorrow I'll explain to you what is the Spirit and how we have problems of our centers. Please also telephone to your friends and tell them to come to get your Realization. Thank you very much! 

(Audience applauding) 

Those who did not feel cool vibrations should not get upset, tomorrow it will work out. 

May God bless you all!

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
