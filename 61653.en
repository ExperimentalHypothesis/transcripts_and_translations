Talk to Sahaja Yogis Vienna Austria, August 4th 1991 71”

It was really very nice of you all of you, to come, come to the airport and all the sadness that I had when I left Belgium just disappeared.  It is a very creditable thing that Sahaja Yoga has taken such dimensions in Vienna, Vienna is a very great important place in Europe as you know long time back Marie Theresa ruled all over Prussia from here with her love and her advisory powers.  For me also we have had something very important and spiritually we can say is the spiritual part of Germany.  And the great sense about this is this that if Germans can take to anything, everything can be germinated as they say and that is what it is, such a great thing to see.  Such a blessing and one deserves that.  You people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.  It is not an easy thing to take to Sahaja Yoga normally for people who are so much in the modern world, progressing and so well educated and (?) intellectuals I should say, but despite all that here suddenly you find so many people who have not only understood Sahaja yoga but its gone into their heart, and into their lives, and they feel  it is so important. Also sort of you all have taken a responsibility because it is now spreading through you again. And also to Yugoslavia. It is something so remarkable I feel, that you have been able to achieve this kind of state of your being that really (managed somehow) to come out of the mire of the future.  But I think it is the destiny because there are so many countries where I have worked where I have been but in Austria the way I have seen people so very expressing their belief, it is something very astonishing and remarkable.

When Gregoire was posted here he told me Mother I am so lonely, there’s no Sahaja Yogis here and then how it prospered and how (it grew and developed?) I think that also it is your goodness,  the goodness of your past lives, and that you are here, and that Austria has really showed so many numbers, not only in quantity but also in quality. 5.11 Whatever may be the reasons whatever may be the circumstances it is very very surprising.  I am sure all the Gods in the heavens must be showering flowers upon you to see how you people have taken to this subtle life. Also understanding the inner being, its working, its manifestation, its effects, is not an easy thing at all but the enlightenment is so great, that you people really have done wonders. Only I would say that we have had a mishap but it is for good I tell you, because to correct you people  so you do much better. You are all trying to learn more to resist this kind of nonsense. And then one starts wondering, see how can it be a person who has seen all the miracles ( stayed for the miracles?) who got transformation, everything from one pot just slipped.  I think hidden somewhere are these conditionings and hankerings it just overpowers like these negative forces and people get lost, they forget what they achieved, what they have got (??).

The other day I was talking before the puja I said at the time of puja how much people had to sacrifice, they had to, if they were kings they had to give up all their kingdom, all their wealth and surrender to the collective, (??) and they had to wear only one cloth (which they had to?) tied up here big knot, not stitched.  (Mother points to her right shoulder). And they had to sleep on mats, and the food was all boiled which was brought from villages and then it was cooked and then everybody would eat whether it was sufficient or not.  Now they all of them came from very Rich families, (??) All these people, and showed such great (??) And all of them to join with this and how much they had to sacrifice.  First of all the hair had to be absolutely shaved, had to give up your husbands your wives, your children, (?) It was even worse than the nuns and the priests that you have.

That was all for cleansing I have told in these lectures that sahaja yoga has another very basic way of cleansing you without going through all of these horrible things, very simple thing now that is collectivity.   Collectivity is like the ocean and clears you out and this is so simple so easy you enjoy the collectivity.  Once you start enjoying the collectivity you don't have to worry about you give up this, you give up that, automatically it starts working as if you get dissolved in the ocean of collectivity. So all these austerities you did not have and it has worked out in such a normal way and you enjoy yourself because in Guru Puja there was only one tent there and I said you can this is one big chance for you, you can go there and stay there, but nobody got out, 11.01 not one single person went there, (I was?) (I thought at least ?) but nobody went there, I couldn’t understand, but they were saying Mother we are enjoying here, why should we go there, we are all enjoying each other, we are enjoying this climate we are enjoying this water and the river and is so beautiful, why should we go there,  I said for your convenience you have small the children. No no this is alright, and the children were all quiet so it was not only for the atmosphere or anything but it was all connected and the nearness of each other. 11.41 and for three days nobody went there, it was not a very comfortable place from a body point of view but I think you lost consciousness of your body, just enjoyed the spirit. (?) At first I thought you were formal about it, but later on I found out that it was your desire.  It was a very very surprising thing for people,  I kept that castle for 3 days for all.  We made all the arrangements for you in that castle, but you would not go there (?) so I think that we have now learned how to enjoy our spirit and our collectivity and you feel that. Also those countries which could not somehow or other been able to get to Sahaja Yoga must go and receive this 12.57 blessing. It's such a new thing.  I mean people used to go in other countries just to invade them, possess them, rule them, as we had for 300 years.  13.20 I mean Germany was just the same,  I must say (French?), but to love them and to give them the message of love, to redeem, talk about, the truth was never heard, never heard of it.  And in that village of Cabella when you all came away they wanted that they should also have a program in Cabella and then they came and I asked the mayor why do you want to have a program? So he said Mother we have never see such a group of people, they are all saints, how can you make them saints.  They didn’t quarrel, they didn’t fight, they didn’t do anything, (?) we find they are so quiet so silent, so beautiful, 14.59 so loving, how have you made them? I said they are like that, they are made like that, just they trust themselves, that's all, we also trust ourselves (??) alright come along and at least 75% got realisation, old people didn’t get much but I think they will, and then what happened.  I must tell you this story.  This (editor?) heard about it (??) and the (editor?) sent them a newspaper with a some sort of a very bad, 15.18 scandalous, horrible, which had published this report of the French, no other newspaper published it, because they would not accept it.  So the mayor came out with it, and he said see now, (?) he belonged to the Christian Democratic Party,  and he also and he said the church has said so (?) and have given him the latest news about this (??) that Mr Ghandi was murdered by some gentleman who was actually (at this point a crowd of people and children join the talk and settle themselves down) so this mayor (?) you see was so brave so (?) that man that murdered Mr Ghandi was a mafia man (?) and that man was (paid by ???) he confessed it, so he took this article 19.01 and showed said see now (something about America) these newspapers go on killing news like that.  But the way, I didn’t know what to say to him, but this kind of courage, for that mayor to have, also comes from the truth that he knows about sahaja Yoga.  And we thought we would never have any pujas there, but he said (you are all going to have (?) all the pujas here, I mean so beautiful 19.46 so happy about himself. (?) No problem as such. So I did meet him and I mean I was upset, but he was not after all.  20.09 So this is how your behaviour, your love, your understanding of each other and the enjoyment of each other really convinced him that this is some another place coming from the (you all?). They don’t look like normal human beings so this is what it is our behaviour, (?) even if inside it may not be of a very high quality, but your behaviour outside is very convincing and people are amazed how so many people can live happily together and myself (? Myself)).  And somehow or other, anybody who is not worthy who is not worthy of the collective is just thrown away.  21.19 the whole thing gets decided in no time and is just thrown away.  We don't have to worry it is like a mechanism that works.   Automatically I mean its like a machinery I sometimes feel that as long as that is not alright throws away. (?) That’s what is so obvious now, as working out in such a beautiful manner. 22.02

21.59 I am happy to arrange these weddings because I never have a chance to talk to Sahaja Yogis, mostly in the programs you disappear and the ashrams are very small places where we cannot meet.

But I was feeling if you have any questions you can ask them.  Everybody asks me questions

In the hall.  22.35 (?) (and something about doubtless awareness)

Yogini asks a question....”what is the best time for meditation and why and what is  the relation between the timing of meditation and the activity of the deities and the actions of the deities,

Wolfgang: What is the best time for meditation, and what is, what was the second question? The relation between the time of the day and the deities.

Yogini: Repeats second part of question and I mean why at 4.00 am in the morning? Everyone laughs.

Shri Mataji: You see when you are getting up from your bed actually what is happening that you, your attention is coming out from the subconscious to the conscious mind and then you become fully conscious, but, as the sun starts rising the right side starts working within.  So this conscious mind evidently gets involved with the problems on the right side.  So that is the sort of a time we call (Sanskrit word) between the night time thoughts and the morning time thoughts, called the vilamba in Sanskrit, thats the time (is a force?) when your mind has finished with the night time thoughts and the morning time thoughts have not yet started and deities 25.03 are more alert, because they know that at this time all the sahaja yogis are meditating, I may sleep at 4 o’clock in the night but I am up at 5.00 every day because by that time the evening hangovers are over and the morning problems have not yet started.  There is a pause, and the best meditation is achieved if you practice it.  Its that as soon as you get up you go and have a shower and sit down, it is easy to achieve thoughtless awareness at that time than any other time.

26.00 That’s why it is deeper meditation you reach.  I think in Sahaja yoga this is the only thing. There is no compulsion, you can get up at 12 o’clock, have your meditation at 1 o’clock, there’s no compulsion, there’s no compulsion at all.  The dawn is coming and the nature is awakening so welcome the dawn, it is neither hot nor cold and the dew starts dropping on then.  Fresh flowers are only found in the morning, because that is the time when there is no bombardment of the outside.

26.56 Even children, normally they get up in the morning, normally, but when we grow up, specially in the western countries I have seen people have developed the habit of sleeping late and getting up late.  But if you start getting up early in the morning for a (reasonable?) and just force yourself, just manage it, you should sleep early, what is the use of keeping awake in the night? But say if there is a musical night or something or my program. I slept in the (aeroplane?) I can sleep (very well/anywhere?), but morning time I must get up wherever I may be.  Its not necessary that 4 o’clock here it will be 4 o’clock in India, but wherever I am in the morning time I just get up because I find its so fragrant, the coming day, and attention is the best and in India mostly.  I mean nowadays of course we are westernised quite a lot, but formerly by 5 o’clock everyone was taking their bath. (?)  One of the reasons of their health is that they get up very early and have their bath and you must have seen Indians, then when you were in Ganapatipule you never see them going for any bath, they are ready at the time you were out there,  and you will feel much more fresh there.  Of course there is no compulsory thing for you you can get up whenever you like, at any time you like,  there is no time fixed for that, (?) but if you ask me I would say that this will be a better time.  Now supposing if you get up at about 9 o’clock then you will not even have time to brush your teeth, you are in a hurry now you have to go you have attend to your work, you have to rush, and these ideas are coming into your head.

29.45 So thats the (recommended?) time, the additional time you can say.  So supposing normally you go to your work about 8 o’clock say, you normally get up at 7 0clock to be ready for 8 0clock, but say supposing you get up at 5 or 5.30 have your bath get ready and then you have about nicely an hour to settle down yourself at that time you need not think or plan for anything.

30.19 As it is as you know that we are very sensitive to timing..there is a case of a work watch. if you have to tell somebody that you have to go to the airport, even after Sahaja Yoga I have seen people start going (Mother makes a flapping action with her arms) I dont know what goes wrong with the name of the airport, and they become nervous.  I have travelled so much I have never missed a plane, except for one, and that was for a puja that was the day I combined so much, I didn’t miss it, actually, that day I didn’t go.

31.03 But I am surprised as soon as they have to go to the airport the whole thing becomes, so people start to become, (discussing?), fast and all that.

Also before retiring you should meditate because then you are much more fresh in the morning you can meditate and cleanse yourself, its like a bath, because now the inner growth has to start.  You see the nature in the morning only is the best time.  Anywhere 31.45 you go to a hill  to see the beauty of a mountain, the (?) Matterhorn, the peak of Matterhorn becomes so beautiful, only in the morning. You will be surprised it will change your system so well that  you can cope with so many things because that is the time it is so peaceful. I mean you can achieve that peace within yourself.

So its not compulsory, no, I mean in Sahaja Yoga its not compulsory its your own path.  32.40  But especially for Germans, I must say must be the laziest, I am so amazed they are so disciplined themselves.  Your liver problems can be improved by that very much, spleen problems can be improved very much because at that time there is no emergency of anything, because of emergency only you develop all these problems.  If people start getting up in the morning as it is I think  (blood cancer will not appear?) and in the morning as you know very well that all the vampires and all of these are asleep, as soon as they see the sun in their eyes they disappear, they do not like the light of the sun.  So its between the two, when the sun is on top of your head then you are on the right side, in the 33.51 middle of the night you are on the left.  But the morning time is the one where these things do not exist, also in the evening, but evening you have the whole days problems. So between the two extremes you have to find out the middle point,  as you know we have to be in the centre, and for time this is the centre, once in the morning and once in the evening.  Its a very nice question.  But its very deep.  All the saints in the olden days, I mean you can see how our Indian music is, its always started very early in the morning.  They started you see it started very early in the morning, you see ragas like Bhairavi and all that (?) are all morning ragas, most of the ragas are in the morning or in the evening, there are very few ragas for the centre, for the midday.  34.37 so get out of the traffic jam of your thoughts. (?)   Morning is the best, people don’t mind anything in the evening,  but morning people don't mind it because they are right sided. (?)

35.31 Any other questions?

Yogini: I want to ask Mother about microwaves.

Wolfgang: She wants to ask about microwaves, is it dangerous to use microwaves? SM I don't think it is that dangerous, but just to be careful with anything too much, (??) you see as it is we are cooking on electric stoves so we are not away from electricity.  Even if you go with a little bit of microwaves it doesn't matter, (?) but the complication is not at the microwave level, it is much earlier because here the food is so complicated, (Mother gestures for more people to move into the space near the stage.)  its a very complicated thing is that, I mean.  (Come in that space) So at that level I don't think its that dangerous, (?) as the earlier stage where the food is so much controlled and there is no small entrepreneurs and it has to be like the factory problems sort of a thing, it is very complicated....and the manufacturing also earlier was so, using such horrible fertilisers, this and that, you see it all has very deep repercussions.  I think It is getting more and more complicated because you can't have small entrepreneurs.  I mean for a small city like Belgium now. Once upon a time when I came to Belgium and Holland, I was surprised that there were only farmers they were not using anything as to what you can call as a factory.  They never had any factory and 65 of them.   And I asked them how? How do you get on with all these videos, (electricals?)  and all that, I said how do you get these (electricals? Televisions) How do you get from where? He said very simple, I said How? He said you send 25 bluebell flower germs, and you can get tape recorder, and you spend say 25 pounds and you get, you get a television so why should we make TVs and this and that?  He said we can get from Germany. I said why do the Japanese make microwaves?  Because they don't have land, we have land, so why should not we use our land and sell these.  He was very wise and sensible man. (But today its not in use in Holland?) (I don't know what is the need to do all these things, is it because the publishing is not so good maybe?). You cannot get fresh fruit there it becomes such a big organisation that nobody can penetrate.  (So you have to lead that kind of a thing now?) I mean you must have heard about England, there was something wrong with the eggs, and the chickens with the cows 39.51 and its on and on and on. Everything seems to be infected somehow, so the problem is not so much at the individual level but at the beginning of it now. As for that the best for you Sahaja Yogis is to eat vibrated things don't eat any fertilisers,  nothing,  whenever it is vibrated, water, fruits or vegetables, or any crops could be very beautiful and produce such sunflowers, as big as that (Shri Mataji describes a huge circle with her hands) (?) so big as that. You couldn't even lift one. 40.44 and I mean they gave such a lot of seeds and so big that you would not  believe (that these are the seeds of sunflower without any fertiliser, nothing just pure vibrations, no fertiliser if they receive these fertilisers they die, they can't,  they don’t like it they cant.   So the whole system has to change only, of course, I mean if you could go to the earlier days when people used to cook with firewood and all that, the best, but you can't cook now somehow you have to (suck up?) because we have removed all the trees so we don't have firewood, so we can't cook like that so you have to take to electricity. But too much stale food also one should not eat. Too much stale.

What to do in this society that it is.  The only thing you can do is to give (holy/whole?) vibrations to your food and eat it. so at least you will not have a bad affect, that is the whole salient point.  But later on I am sure we will have agriculture which will be done through vibrated water.  We will have no problems because we grow 10X more sometimes than they have and non hybrid, and at least double the hybrid so if people will take to this kind of farming  I hope in your lifetime you will get that, if you would like ?  Because you will go crazy if you are all thinking along those lines, please don't (?)  Like some sort of a horrible disease came on the Cows in England.  What they discovered that they had a lot of these things from the chicken, their bones and also meat and all that, that's what they were giving to the cows. Now the cows don't eat meat, doesn't suit them.  So they develop all these diseases It's all a money making proposition there is such a lot of this throws away.  There is no sense of proportion.  The amount of butter that is thrown away, (?) I mean what is the use of producing so much and then throwing it?

43.56 Because to keep up the price you see, not human beings.  But keep up the price then throw away, even in (Latin America?).  So there is no understanding of totality that's all, but as Sahaja Yogis you should understand.  So at this point a microwave is not going to make much of a difference, because they don't enter into the food so much as all other things.

What else?

Wolfgang asks: Shri Mataji, A request has been made, They are asking about ozone gas

SM: Ozone also is a problem as you know, ozone is the whole thing, it is the one,  latent oxygen.  If there is one thing that this latent oxygen is basically assimilated within us.  For your information when you get your realisation your breath gives out this latent oxygen.  The more people, if they become realised more ozone will be available and the vibrations also, breath and the carbon dioxide or monoxide whatever it is break so that ozone will generate.  Because of the ozone only we get this production, as I mean you must have seen when he was trying to save this (Indian Shipping ?) he put my photographs there.  Now it is a fact that my photographs has vibrations.  That is established. The other day I saw a photograph of a photograph, and I  mean you could see it from all sides, tremendous, just like (violent?) vibrations there was?

46.40. So they give vibrations, once they give vibrations things, the carbon monoxide, or what you call acid rain, and all that, are transformed and the compound is broken and ozone is produced. These vibrations think, organise and ?.  How my photographs give light. It is a good question to have asked.  Can you answer? 47.23 47.36 Of course there is light microlights coming out of my vibrations, You cant see it normally, sometimes you do though. This time they saw the grace and also during puja (where they were facing?) they saw the vibrations coming.  So they can form into anything to convince you about Sahaja Yoga, their whole effort is to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.  So all these lights which are emitting you see when the camera flashing, flashes you see that light, these lights are in the microlights that I have and you get those lights coming out, but because these vibrations think around and they are arranging it, immediately they arrange. These vibrations have got light they immediately arrange themselves in such a way as soon as there  49.06 is a photograph (but not ??? ) There was a lady she said In her heart she said “Mother can i ??” There were five or six photographs were taken, (?) what she gets is a big hole in front and the sun behind 49.29 So whatever you desire, or not desire these think for you, they organise as we are in human form they are in vibration form, but they are (essentially/inestimably?) collective, sensible and they don’t have these conditionings as we have, like an ego, its all I should say very automatic.  We cant understand the automatic thinking in these (times?) because we are used to machines, but we cannot understand this automatic thinking that as soon as say,  this thing sees me here (pointing to the microphone) and it comes up like that, we can't think we have ruled it out but these vibrations immediately they organise themselves automatically again 50.44 such a rapport, we cannot understand, human beings cannot understand such a rapport.  (But we have to recede back and think about it ?) It seems incredible (?) but we have never seen such things especially in these times.

50.54

Yogini: Inaudible question, something like “how does life come about”  (something about dead matter)

Wolfgang: Repeats question but inaudible.

SM: How can they explain because they don’t believe in God.

Yogini asks another inaudible question.

SM: Yes of course you see they go from one, and they say first it was say matter, then they say alright, then they say alright carbon came in (so there is no ?, chemistry) then they say nitrogen came in, but they can't say how the nitrogen came in, the composition, how (life?) was created because they don’t know, they never also see how, how a rose has come from a seed, how our eyes are made, how 52.45 we became human beings, they don’t know how. 52.46 That is what  Tao means, Tao means don’t know How. Its a living process they cannot explain so how can they tell you how the life comes in, but you can see these vibrations and they act 53.13. What I told about Omkar and Cross and Swastika, I already I have got an Indian Paper, with those in it that explains that,  its all very scientific.   Many Scientists start thinking that they are the ultimate.  How can they explain? There is something so much beyond.  Who has created them. Science is nothing, whatever you see, say alright this is a carpet, like that, nothing more than that, it is much more (?)

53.55 Yogini asks a question about Fatima.

Wolfgang: She wants to know whether Fatima was a good person.  (Someone says “I just warned her”)

54.28 SM: Could be.

Yogini: So how do you know? Asks another inaudible question.

SM: Could be, because you know...Yogini interrupts

SM have you seen a photograph of mine in (?) India, I am surprised you have not seen that, the English have got it where She appears before me when we are having this puja? This was a puja in Bangkok.

55.00 Yogi 1: When Christ went to England how did he go? What route did he take?

Yogi 2: The routes to England, did he go by ship or?

SM: thats what the English believe, I don’t know, but it was not difficult for him, he could walk on the water. (?)  You know that Moses made a bridge?  Anything is possible. (?)

56.31 Yogini: There is an nuclear atomic power station in Bulgaria and there is a hole in it and nuclear energy is coming out.

Wolfgang: She wants to know whether it is dangerous. (????)

SM: Yes it is.  You see it is protected now, I am sure it will be alright it’s protected,  I know about it.

57.04 You see human beings (always go to extremes, it’s absolutely?).  There is no need to bring so much with these material powers, the spiritual power is the ultimate, they have gone to the extremes of creating atomic power and it’s the power of hatred and separating.

57.34 Yogini: So can we find another energy instead of this dangerous energy like atomic energy.

SM: of course there is (?)  You see this all has to be neutralised rapidly.  But this is definitely the choice of human beings.  If you want then you have.  If you want this energy then you have it  but somehow those who are resurrected will be saved somehow. If they are bent upon destroying themselves what can you do?  Now this Saddam Hussein he has come up (?) , there is some sort of a political game they are playing which allows it.  I just don’t understand it. 58.40 American tactics are always ( in the air ?)

Because of this, because of that, I just don’t know.  They said that because of fundamentalisms they think that other fundamentalists might come up so they have to support Saddam Hussein in Iraq. 59.04 But I find such fundamentalism in France very much.  There are really bad people in France I tell you, absolutely fundamentalists of the last word.  Italy is all fundamentalist for the last so many years it is ruled by this so called Democratic Christian Party 59.29. They are all fundamentalists.  England is very fundamentalist, (?) about England,  (they are all coming up?) they all judge England as very corrupt but nobody can do anything about it.

SM: What else?

Yogini: Question inaudible, something about Austria joining the EU.

1.00.00

Wolfgang: Is it auspicious for Austria to join the EU community.

SM: Yes of course, it will be nice throughout for people. I think from Australia they will be spreading Sahaja Yoga to Europe.  You are very convincing people I must say, Italians are good (throughout?) they are good for their own ascent and for collective ascent. (But Australians are good ?)  But for prosperity/posterity? I think Austrians are the best.  (They show how to get it right?)

Yogi: Shri Mataji will it work out that in Austria they will accept Vishwa Nirmala Dharma as solution?

SM: You all should desire.  (Something about vibrations) You see they have said that if there are so many thousand people if they are willing to accept it as (great?) (or something?)  Its easy in Austria. Its good. Its much easier. Germany would be difficult but not Austrians or Switzerland. (??) (Complete control over weddings?) Complete arrangement and (??) (Medically?) is one of the most ?? I think.

(Sahaja Yogis and Mother talking, Mother is asking about a book very unclear.)

SM: There’s a book out isn't there, In Gods Name, they say that its ??? Political, Germany people, the people, have they not read it? What it is?

Yogi: They have read it, now they are publishing, a second wave recently they made it to all the households in Vienna I think.  Just a (surveillance leak?) I think they will get it sent so I think the second wave will reach more people.

SM: (so what of the book?) There are so many things, you see it is three days since I have been in Italy, something has worked out, and it is really shocking, they are not only criminals but they are murderers and this and that and against this pope so many things are there, this particular pope that he sent arms to Paraguay, he sent arms to Poland, he sent arms to Argentina to help the Germans there, can you imagine using Gods name openly? In India we have such a long tradition we would never (function?) in that way.  (But/not?) Really in Germany, and still people are not willing to believe anything. 1.03.14 This pope was definitely murdered no doubt,  1.03.23 how horrible people (??) this thing, that thing.  I really was shocked, I mean it is more than the mafia. And there’s a lady (Scalis’?) wife, she is writing so many things now. Also now since I have been in Italy and Germany these past days so many things are coming out (about this pope?) All the news its tremendous. But Italians, I don't know. How can they accept? But I can't understand the Germans, and we are blacklisted in Germany can you imagine.

How can a church have a bank, imagine Sahaja Yoga having a bank.

1.04.20 and that bank siphoning all the money from these developing countries,  (even the money from these developing countries goes there?) and siphoning it off to these banks in Switzerland. They have banks they have (?) they have everything. Its a very good way, to create banks in the name of God to get money in the name of God,   Put all the money there, send to all these people in Switzerland,   1.04.43 I mean you people should really awaken to this, it is really really a big big mafia of the worst type, but at least mafia is the mafia but this is Gods name. These horrible things, I mean (???).  The people told us there that this place was a nunnery and one of the walls broke and out of that they saw a nun being completely bent standing there in her clothes, alive.

1.05.39

Also they said that in one of these nunneries where the women of these nuns are not allowed to go out it caught fire so they all came away and they had to clean the place and they found groups of small small children there quite a lot.  Such unnatural secretive life they are leading and no body wants to probe and find out. 1.06.21 (?)

Of course I mean, of course in India, also we had such things, I am not saying, but because it is not organised, you see the religion is not organised, its on a very small scale, and it just gets blasted.

There has been no improvement for the last 2,000 years. And these french things also being done by these (catholics? Priests?) you know that.

1.07.00 I think they are frightened because on this Fatima tape I said because that a celestial Mother is going to arrange everything and this is the resurrection time, so they are frightened of that (resurrection time?) that’s what they are.

But imagine from one boy from France 4 journalists went there, can you imagine (?) and they saw one gate of the school as an (??) can you imagine, as a (worldly?) must be drunk or something.  (?) Every school has a gate. And they published its all over the world, even (?) wrote to me to say  he has seen it (?)   They published it in Bangkok, and a lady who was a sahaja yogini who was working in a French school she lost her job.  Can you imagine this? Whilst this boy was taken to the psychiatrist and they said he’s quite normal but he didn’t know anything about sex, so they were all frightened and so they all explained to him very clearly (plus the education?)   Freud was anti Christ no doubt about it, so they are all following Freud.  1.8.40 Such a conspiracy, I think. If you go to India from there take a plane to Delhi,  from Delhi by train, then a taxi these 4 people went there, so many boys come from India nobody does that.  Germany had so many German people came to study, so many from England. (?) So many children have said that to me (?) the school, can anyone enter into a school like that without permission? (??) told lies after lies they are such liars, this German woman talking I know she is a liar a very great German liar throughout her German life imagine. How can they believe one woman and they dont want to believe you all?

1.10.00

Just want to believe one woman, stupid thing, what is there to believe?   So that shows that what a negative (formulative?) force is there.  (???) we have vibrations with us. Actually I dont know why I gave a bandhan to the judge or the child, he was very arrogant.  Suddenly he has come on our side and he has said (???) he is giving all these clues to us and he is saying they will ask this question, so have your answer ready and all 1.10.52 ......???? Turn the tables, so dont you worry.  Is the mafia( ?) I think if you have any more questions you must write to me.  We have to be happy like the amrut.

May God bless you.
