b'Radio Interview, The Innate Religion\nAthens, Stamatis Boudouris house (Greece) 23/05/1989\n\nStarts at 1:08\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6.Inside. Because it\'s very hot and inside, the house is very small. I hope it works out. You see, I didn\'t expected so many people would be coming. So, I think, doesn\'t matter, we\'ll see about it. But, tonight became so cold inside the room. I was really frozen.\nSahaja Yogi: For us, Shri Mataji, we sat all day in the sunlight a nd we don\'t feel hot or anything. It has been very good.\n\nShri Mataji: Dnyaneshwar has written about you people. He\'s calling you people: "Martanda deta pahina" [sun; give;\xc2\xa0?].\nThe Surya is the Sun, without any heat in it.\nHe\'s discribed Sahaja Yogis: "Maartanda deta pahina" they are like Sun but there is no heat in them.\n""Andremadji [unsure] a lajjene" "\nThey are like Moon but there is no, no spots on them.\n"Lajjene" is a spot, is regarded as a kind of a thing you\'re ashamed of. So without any spots to be ashamed of, is the description of a Dnyaneshwar about Sahaja Yogis.\nWonderful description!\nIf you - let it be, let it be, let it be there she wants to be with Me.\nNow, don\'t pull her. Why do you want to pull her? She\'s quite all right. Come here!\nCome here, come here!\nShe\'s feeling insulted now. Come, come, come, come.\nYou are all right. Now, you\'ll have chana? Come here, come! Take some chana. Come!\nAll right, come. Come along you come with her otherwise, she -\nCome, come along. Come along.\n\nHello. Now what do you want to eat?\nYou like this\xc2\xa0?\nGood.\nNow, sit down. Sit down.\nThat is sweet.\nNow, I have this sweet girl!\nAnd what\'s your name?\nAlright, you eat that first.\nIs, that is tea?\nSahaja Yogini: This is a special drink of Greece it is neutral " salutaries" .\n\nShri Mataji: What\'s it?\nSahaja Yogini: It\'s a welcome drink. "Salutaries" mixt with water.\nShri Mataji: Sour.\nSahaja Yogini: Yes.\nShri Mataji: ll just keep on Me.\nGood.\n\nYou\'re supposed to eat this?\n[The Sahaja Yogini does not hear]\nAre you supposed to eat this?\n\nShri Mataji: Yes?\n\nSahaja Yogi: We have this journalist from the national radio here.\nShri Mataji: Oh, here?\nSahaja Yogi: He would like an interview if You agree. They just came.\nShri Mataji: All right, all right.\nSahaja Yogi: Is this all right?\nHe told that he wants to do this announcement now,\nShri Mataji: All right.\nSahaja Yogi: About Sahaja Yoga.\nShri Mataji: Please.\nSahaja Yogi: We had this meeting.\nShri Mataji: So let him have a chair or something.\n\nYou have [?] again\n\nHello\n\nSit down, please.\n\nI did this. Please\n\nYou\'ll translate.\n\nGood.\n\nI\'m sorry I don\'t know the Greek language.\n\nHe says that it\'s-\nCome here.\n\nHe says that it\'s nice that there is somebody that can translate for them.\nOh, I see.\n\nTranslator: He has few questions to tell you and then if you want to say something more, whatever you wish.\nShri Mataji: No, better ask him the questions, it\'s the best.\nTranslator: Yes.\nShri Mataji: Does he know something about Sahaja Yoga?\n[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]\n\nTranslator: He was informed today by a small target but he\nShri Mataji: I see.\n\nSo, if you ask Me questions and then I\'ll tell you, even elaborately you can ask Me questions.\n\nInterview starts at 12:22\n\nTranslator: You can energize, he\'s asking, You can energize a very high energy that is in the universe.\nAnd you say that this energy is in a - around way in man.\nYou, that of course, have been driven in this inner -\n\nSahaja Yogini: It\'s better if I translate. Can I translate for you?\nNuclear or corus [core].\n\nGuido: Can you put the question clear because.\nSahaja Yogini: Can we make e [continues in Greek]\n\nShri Mataji: What is it?\nTranslator: It\'s too complicated.\n\nSahaja Yogini: He says: You are able to mobilize, to make active an energy that\'s inside us and it\'s dormant. When you awakened this energy, what did you find? What did you discover?\n\nAnother Sahaja Yogini: When You came inside your own\nSahaja Yogini: Inside, inside your own Self, your own being, a core of being. what did You find?\nShri Mataji: What did I find or what anybody else finds.\nSahaja Yogini: He wants to know, he wants an answer from you, but if you...\nShri Mataji: No, I mean what happens to people.\nSahaja Yogini: To people, OK.\nAnother Sahaja Yogini: No, no he\'s not asking that. He\'s actually asking you were the first saw this energy that You could awaken in people. When You saw it in Yourself, he says, what did You see?\nBecause human being cannot see, cannot be aware of this energy, of this power. But You are aware of it and of course, what did You see?\nShri Mataji: You see-\nAnother Sahaja Yogini: When it, when it all started.\nShri Mataji: My problem is that I must be something. I don\'t want to talk about Myself so much. Because when Christ talked about himself, you see, what he told was the truth, you see, [Journalist talks at the same time] When he told it was the truth he said that he was the Son of God. That he was. We can prove it also. But they crucified him.\nSo it\'s better that I don\'t talk about Myself so much, what I am. Because to understand Me you have to become a Spirit. You have to become the Self-realized soul. You have to become the Self-realized soul, as a twice-born actually.\n\nBut still I can tell him that on the fifth of May 1970, I saw the primordial Kundalini like a telescope opening up and breaking through your Sahastrara, you see I saw it the primordial.\n\nSahaja Yogini: He says he wants to know more about what exactly is this energy that there is in the universe and what are the results when it\'s awakened in someone.\n\nShri Mataji: You see, this is the All-pervading Power all over about which - [problem with the mike]\n\n[Big laughter]\nCameraman: This is an energy.\n[Big laughter; applause]\nShri Mataji: So, this is the All-pervading Power which all the scriptures have talked about, which is the subtle power which we don\'t see, we don\'t feel it. But it does all the living work. For example, a seed becomes a tree and the flowers are there but a rose shoot will produce only roses. And an orange will produce only orange. All this choice and all this work all living work even the pulsation of our heart is done by this All-pervading Power.\n\nSahaja Yogini: He is asking for Your help that he may understand.\nShri Mataji: Oh, I see.\nSahaja Yogini: What are the results of the awakening of this energy inside the human being?\nShri Mataji: All right. Now inside the human being, there is this energy residing in the sacrum bone.\n\nShri Mataji: It\'s a, it\'s in three and a half coils.\n\nAnd because the coils are called as "Kundala" in Sanskrit language, it\'s called as Kundalini.\nSahaja Yogini: Yes.\nShri Mataji: Now, this energy is placed dormantly within us, but when it is awakened it passes through subtle six centres which are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.\n\nAlso in Sanskrit, they call it "kendra" [centre]. So, in Sanskrit also they call it "kendra".\n\nSahaja Yogini: Kendra? Yes, we say kendra in Greek also.\nIn Sanskrit, there is a similar word for this [she forgets to translate]\n[Big laughter.]\n\nSahaja Yogini: I\'m sorry.\nHe says: "The centre is in the centre."\n\nShri Mataji: So what happens, I didn\'t tell what happens.\n\nSo, when this energy passes through your six centres what happens that it nourishes these centres.\nBy the nourishment of these centres, your diseases can get cured, first. Then, if you are mentally upset, you can be cured of your tensions and even schizophrenia and all these things. Then, thirdly, your mental capacity increases. And the fourthly, you feel completely joyous.\nBut the most, people who got Self-realization first feel the Collective Consciousness, which is described by Jung and many others, that is All-pervading Power, as cool breeze on their fingertips.\nSahaja Yogini: Yes.\n\nShri Mataji: Actually, Athena is the Primordial Mother. And we call her Adi Shakti or Holy Ghost. And she is reflected within us as the kundalini.\nThis is the Primordial Mother.\n\nSahaja Yogini: He is asking: "When this energy is not awakened in us is it functioning at all or not at all?"\nShri Mataji: It is not functioning and we can see that we are not integrated, people. Because if you, if you want to do something from your mind, your heart may say "no". Your attention will say "no". So there\'s no integration.\nAnd secondly, not only that, that when this energy is not awakened in a person, the religion which is innate, within you, is not awakened. So you may follow any religion, but you can do any sins, all of them are just the same. They are not righteous people. They are not peaceful people. They talk about it but; it\'s nothing inside, innate. The religion, the innate religion [every becomes dark]\nToo much of heat.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Doesn\'t work.\n\nShri Mataji: Too much pressure of energy.'
