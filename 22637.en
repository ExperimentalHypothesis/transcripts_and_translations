....Inside. Because it's very hot and inside, the house is very small. I hope it works out. You see, I didn't expected so many people would be coming. So, I think, doesn't matter, we'll see about it. But, tonight became so cold inside the room. I was really frozen.Sahaja Yogi: For us, Shri Mataji, we sat all day in the sunlight a nd we don't feel hot or anything. It has been very good.

Shri Mataji: Dnyaneshwar has written about you people. He's calling you people: "Martanda deta pahina" [sun; give; ?].The Surya is the Sun, without any heat in it.He's discribed Sahaja Yogis: "Maartanda deta pahina" they are like Sun but there is no heat in them.""Andremadji [unsure] a lajjene" "They are like Moon but there is no, no spots on them."Lajjene" is a spot, is regarded as a kind of a thing you're ashamed of. So without any spots to be ashamed of, is the description of a Dnyaneshwar about Sahaja Yogis.Wonderful description!If you - let it be, let it be, let it be there she wants to be with Me.Now, don't pull her. Why do you want to pull her? She's quite all right. Come here!Come here, come here!She's feeling insulted now. Come, come, come, come.You are all right. Now, you'll have chana? Come here, come!

So, if you ask Me questions and then I'll tell you, even elaborately you can ask Me questions.

Interview starts at 12:22

Translator: You can energize, he's asking, You can energize a very high energy that is in the universe.And you say that this energy is in a - around way in man.You, that of course, have been driven in this inner -

Sahaja Yogini: It's better if I translate. Can I translate for you?Nuclear or corus [core].

Guido: Can you put the question clear because.Sahaja Yogini: Can we make e [continues in Greek]

Shri Mataji: What is it?Translator: It's too complicated.

Sahaja Yogini: He says: You are able to mobilize, to make active an energy that's inside us and it's dormant. When you awakened this energy, what did you find? What did you discover?

Another Sahaja Yogini: When You came inside your ownSahaja Yogini: Inside, inside your own Self, your own being, a core of being. what did You find?Shri Mataji: What did I find or what anybody else finds.Sahaja Yogini: He wants to know, he wants an answer from you, but if you...Shri Mataji: No, I mean what happens to people.Sahaja Yogini: To people, OK.Another Sahaja Yogini: No, no he's not asking that. He's actually asking you were the first saw this energy that You could awaken in people. When You saw it in Yourself, he says, what did You see?Because human being cannot see, cannot be aware of this energy, of this power. But You are aware of it and of course, what did You see?Shri Mataji: You see-Another Sahaja Yogini: When it, when it all started.Shri Mataji: My problem is that I must be something. I don't want to talk about Myself so much. Because when Christ talked about himself, you see, what he told was the truth, you see, [Journalist talks at the same time] When he told it was the truth he said that he was the Son of God. That he was. We can prove it also. But they crucified him.So it's better that I don't talk about Myself so much, what I am. Because to understand Me you have to become a Spirit. You have to become the Self-realized soul. You have to become the Self-realized soul, as a twice-born actually.

But still I can tell him that on the fifth of May 1970, I saw the primordial Kundalini like a telescope opening up and breaking through your Sahasrara, you see I saw it the primordial.

Sahaja Yogini: He says he wants to know more about what exactly is this energy that there is in the universe and what are the results when it's awakened in someone.

Shri Mataji: You see, this is the All-pervading Power all over about which - [problem with the mike]

[Big laughter]Cameraman: This is an energy.[Big laughter; applause]Shri Mataji: So, this is the All-pervading Power which all the scriptures have talked about, which is the subtle power which we don't see, we don't feel it. But it does all the living work. For example, a seed becomes a tree and the flowers are there but a rose shoot will produce only roses. And an orange will produce only orange. All this choice and all this work all living work even the pulsation of our heart is done by this All-pervading Power.

Sahaja Yogini: He is asking for Your help that he may understand.Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.Sahaja Yogini: What are the results of the awakening of this energy inside the human being?Shri Mataji: All right. Now inside the human being, there is this energy residing in the sacrum bone.

Shri Mataji: It's a, it's in three and a half coils.

And because the coils are called as "Kundala" in Sanskrit language, it's called as Kundalini.Sahaja Yogini: Yes.Shri Mataji: Now, this energy is placed dormantly within us, but when it is awakened it passes through subtle six centres which are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

Also in Sanskrit, they call it "kendra" [centre]. So, in Sanskrit also they call it "kendra".

Sahaja Yogini: Kendra? Yes, we say kendra in Greek also.In Sanskrit, there is a similar word for this [she forgets to translate][Big laughter.]

Sahaja Yogini: I'm sorry.He says: "The centre is in the centre."

Shri Mataji: So what happens, I didn't tell what happens.

So, when this energy passes through your six centres what happens that it nourishes these centres.By the nourishment of these centres, your diseases can get cured, first. Then, if you are mentally upset, you can be cured of your tensions and even schizophrenia and all these things. Then, thirdly, your mental capacity increases. And the fourthly, you feel completely joyous.But the most, people who got Self-realization first feel the Collective Consciousness, which is described by Jung and many others, that is All-pervading Power, as cool breeze on their fingertips.Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Actually, Athena is the Primordial Mother. And we call her Adi Shakti or Holy Ghost. And she is reflected within us as the kundalini.This is the Primordial Mother.

Sahaja Yogini: He is asking: "When this energy is not awakened in us is it functioning at all or not at all?"Shri Mataji: It is not functioning and we can see that we are not integrated, people. Because if you, if you want to do something from your mind, your heart may say "no". Your attention will say "no". So there's no integration.And secondly, not only that, that when this energy is not awakened in a person, the religion which is innate, within you, is not awakened. So you may follow any religion, but you can do any sins, all of them are just the same. They are not righteous people. They are not peaceful people. They talk about it but; it's nothing inside, innate. The religion, the innate religion [every becomes dark]Too much of heat.

Sahaja Yogi: Doesn't work.

Shri Mataji: Too much pressure of energy.
