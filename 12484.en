Shri Mataji: Yeah, that’s a good idea. 

[from subtitles]

SY: O.k. Shri Mataji: But you should have some accompaniment. There are people who can help. SY: Maybe that fellow… Somebody brought a guitar? Somebody will brought a guitar? SY: [Ethian] you brought a guitar, right? SY: I think she should stand up and and do it because… SY: Stand up! Shri Mataji: What you said? It will be better, isn't? Somebody should accompany her. 

SY: She is going to sing English songs. Can you, can you not give her? Shri Mataji: Come along! SY: No, I don't know, I mean how many… Maybe Antonio or Steve can play with. Shri Mataji: Antonio, where is he? Come along, bring your guitar, come along. SY: I, I don't have. It's actually his guitar at the moment. Shri Mataji: Can you lend him your guitar? SY: No problem. 

The problem solved. Come along. SY: Would you like the piano? Shri Mataji: Just to hold the tune! [hindhi/marathi] Shri Mataji: Just, just to hold the… You need not play if you just hold the… [unclear] SY: You will. Shri Mataji: Alright? SY: You will get the vibrations. Very good. SY: So, I guess I'll just start…. and you can just come in whenever you want. 

Shri Mataji: You best put your [glasses]. SY: Oh, that's nice! Shri Mataji: Is it alright? SY: I think so. SY: This song is called "What is the power of heart" and… [unclear] there is still one more verse that it has to be inspired but I was… inspired by actually [a widow]… Shri Mataji: It's alright. SY: So, I'll just start. Oh, so, the next one is called, this one is called "Lovers and neighbors and Mary's best friends" and I don't really want to say what this mean, except that it is a little bit too in the experimental stage. Shri Mataji: What have you been doing in Boston, with your music? Let’s have something from the Boston people. SY: Well… we haven't prepared anything yet, Mother. 

SY: He hasn't prepared anything yet. SY: From Santa Cruz, Mother, Doug Nicely, whom you have met, has written a few songs, for you. and he would love to come and sing himself. And the next best thing was taping. SY: I don't know if we a have good enough tape for play this to you. Exceptional this song - the first one - is the song about Realization, how he got his Realization, sort of romance, but still the essence is there; and it's… and the next one is a devotional song, and there's no words we can express. And the other one is a song written by Michael [Teashek] who is too shy to sing it, but he would sing it occasionally to Sahaja yogis, and so Doug can nicely sing it, exactly the way that Michael would sang it. So we can get a table for him and play this. And the other side, he wrote a song about the Devi, is like in Mahabharata the battle of good and evil and he wrote this just before he got his Realization. And in this, the battle between good and evils was a huge slaughter and evil conquered good. 

When he got his Self-Realization, he knew it is wrong, he rewrote the end, added one more verse, one more verse. Shri Mataji: Should we hear that? SY: Which side, Mother? Shri Mataji: Let's have before and after. Shri Mataji: Are you alright, Doug? SY - Yes, thank you, yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: I would like to, I would like to meet all the new Sahaja yogis who have come from New York or from Boston, in My room tomorrow morning, all right? SY: Mataji, the speakers are only in this room, so we open the doors, so you can hear it. Very fast. Shri Mataji: What he is said? 

SY: He said that the speakers were in that room, Mother, so they play it, they have to play it from in there but, they'll open the doors, so you can hear it. Shri Mataji: About videos? SY: The voice will come in from that room to this room. Shri Mataji: Why? SY: Because the speakers are there. Shri Mataji: How could they done [unclear] SY: [unclear] can. Shri Mataji: [unclear]. You see, for breakfast we can have it. [unclear]. We'll have it tomorrow at lunch then, we'll all be sitting here.

SY: Seems to be that way, Mother. Shri Mataji: After lunch. SY - We come here again together. Shri Mataji: Take this [unclear]. 

SY: All right, I'll just be, have to be very spontaneous. Shri Mataji: Better. Shri Mataji: You want somebody else to join you? SY: Well, Christine had a flute. That will be good, I think. Shri Mataji: Christine come along. SY: Mother, I didn't bring it. I didn't bring my instrument. Shri Mataji: What is here? [You all are good].

Come, come! Call all the children! 

Where are they gone? SY: Oh yes, Christine, you should sing, too. Shri Mataji: Which one? [Poppin?] SY: No, Christine. Come up here Christine, come on! Shri Mataji: Come along, come along! Where is My purse? SY: Christine has it. Shri Mataji: No, no, this you have it I think.

[hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: You know, this is very very sweet that.. in the, in the house of the Nath, means the primordial master, is dancing Shri Krishna.

Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. Threshold, on the threshold of the house. We just get so detached, that we start dancing there at the threshold only, because we are… not able to see them. Is that's how it is, all the description of the dance. [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: And the another one is that you know there is Nira river, where I have taken the land for you, people, that meets the Bhima river, and both have them join together become Chandrabhaga. And then they go, and then they go to, Chandrabhaga goes to Pandharpur and at Pandharpur… Yes! And at Pandharpur this people join and sing this song. So they are saying that at that river, we take our bath, when the dance is on, we are taking our bath, and we are singing and enjoying ourselves when the dance is on in the house of the Primordial Master. 

Is a very good combination of the Primordial Master and Shri Krishna. That is Vishuddhi chakra, you see. [hindhi/marathi]. SY: Kalavati? Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. [hindhi/marathi]. SY: [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. SY: [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi].

Shri Mataji: One by one. Shri Mataji: Is it too much? SY: It's hard, Mother! Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. [hindhi/marathi]. 

SY: The emphases is on Mi. In this there is a… Then come back. Now let's go from left to right. Shri Mataji: All right? This is the melody Kalavati. SY: Kalavati raag. SY: See, on the same thing. Bagirathi - name of the river. [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: Ganges. 

Shri Mataji: All right? This raag is called Kalavati. Now, this is the last raaga… SY: This us the last… Shri Mataji: It's done to end up the classical. Then we'll have another song from you. [hindhi/marathi]. SY: [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. SY: [hindhi/marathi]. SY: [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. 

SY: All right. This, this song I am going to sing is from raag Chandrakauns, and is one of the songs written for Lord Rama, Shri… the Shri Mataji: Rama. SY: [hindhi/marathi]. The marathi writter Gudi Madgulkar wrote a Geet Ramayan - the Ramayan was written in the form of songs and this is one of the songs when Bharat goes to Lord Rama and request Him to come back and Sita on the, on the throne, called throne, and Rama has gone for one last fourteen years and He cannot come back, so He, He gives him a farewell at the, at the bank of the river Ganges, with the tears in His eyes, and He, He explain to Bharat how much valuable it is to touch the feet of your own, own father. I mean, in our Indian customary we fall at the feet of mother and father - we consider them like Gods. So He explains - that's the entire meaning of it.

Next time Mother, we'll have the sheets with all these [bhajans], next time we ever gather together. SY: We'll all sing together. SY: We'll all know the words.

Then all the false gurus they will be backing off with their [unclear] and will be getting out, out of New York. There might be a general exodus. 

SY: Shri Mataji in, I don't know whether is beeing written in India or in Europe or maybe both, but I think in India they've written a new aarti for You. Shri Mataji: Is it so?

SY: But it has the whole seven verses Shri Mataji: Finished? SY: Seven verses. That's only in the [unclear]. 

SY: If he'll transfer, already in the first they'll jump the gun and then they gather together. Shri Mataji: Oh, they sing Marathi ones very well. Yes, France people. Nobody has come from France. The ways they are now becoming experts in Marathi music. SY: Yes? Shri Mataji: Oh, waw, waw! Aamhi Bhi Ghadalo Tumi Bhi Ghadana. SY: That's nice. SY: Yes. 

Can we sing it now to you Mother? SY: Aamhi Bhi Ghadalo Tumi Bhi Ghadana. SY: What's they sing? SY: What? What? They all sing in group. Shri Mataji: Matajinchya sange mule bi ghadali I used to sing a lot but I've given My throat to the talking, I think. SY: Mother, I'd like to sing you a song that… Shri Mataji: You would? SY: Yes, he is.. Shri Mataji: That's great! SY: I was, I was little worried because I feel that my Vishuddhi has been clearing out too quickly today. 

I'll do the best I can. Shri Mataji: All right. You sing I'll give you a very good Vishuddhi, all right? That's the present. SY: This is a song I wrote. It's about, about weddings and how I feel about marriage. And I wrote up on my own marriage, and I feel it applies for all weddings and… Shri Mataji: That's great. Good celebration. Shri Mataji: Very good. Now your voice is good? 

You must put some heated butter in the nose, all of you. SY: In the… inside? Shri Mataji: Inside. With a, with a dropper, all right? Heat, heat butter and sieve it out. And then, when it is slightly warm, not very warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it in Vishuddhi. It's very important. Because the, I don't know in this country people, is a very simple thing to be done. Once in a while, about say, two-three days later or even every day, doesn't matter. It's like putting cream on your hands, you see, because the cold weather, also chops inside the lining of the nose and when you put this it makes a… nose smooth, and you don't get troubles of it. 

It's very simple. All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do. There are so many things sahaja yogi that suppose to do - one of them is this - that try to keep your Hamsa chakra all right. By keeping your nose all right, you keep your Hamsa chakra better. So, better use this simple method of heating some ghee, we call it. You see, you can prepare it heated butter, keep it in a bottle with a dropper and heat it in the hot water. And then put it in the nose. Just like that, in the night, before sleeping. Even in the ears, you must put olive oil - is very important. For the teeth also, you must take some salt, put some olive oil, and rub your gums. 

With that, you wont have to go to the dentist anymore. That's the best. I've never been to a dentist all My life and I don't want you to go to dentist anymore. So that's a very good way of rubbing your gums with vibrated salt and what you call, the olive oil. Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday, with so much of oil, nicely. Oil it, massage you head and sleep off and next day wash off your head. You feel very much better. If any of you cannot get olive oil, the best is almond oil for the head. Keeps you very peaceful. Especially your children, you must massage them till they are five years of age, every night, when they go off to sleep, in the night. 

Nicely, very, for before sleep. And then put some powder clean it out and let them sleep. Then the children won't be running and upset and all that. They'll become very quiet children, well behave children. Because you people don't massage the children all their lifes they are jumping. And all their lives, they're likely violent. You see, this is the nerves must be soothed down. A very simple method and as you are realised people you sooth them much more. All these small, small things must be taken care of, you see. Now if you have too much of cold, if you have too much of cold, then you can mix up little camphor, with oil and put that in the nose - little I said, not much. 

That also is very good. That also soothes your cold and puts you right. This country has one big problem: is Vishuddhi chakra everywhere in the West - because of the cold. And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you must wear an undershirt. It is compulsory. Whatever may be - it is hot, cold, anything. In India even when extremely hot, you must wear an undershirt because when it is very hot you start perspiring and that perspiration causes problems. So, always wear an undershirt whether you are in a hot season or a cold season. That's a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis, that they must wear. And for all of them also is compulsory that they should always wear a muffler when they go out during winter time - it is an important thing. 

And also put some these cotton wools in the ears, as I put it. For your sake I have to put it, because you are careless. So I look after you by putting into My ears like this. So you all should put it before going out. And keep your head covered in the night - when you sleep cover your head with something and then sleep. Because most of the time your body is all covered but the head is not covered. Because now you are realized souls, and your Sahasrara is weak. So you must look after your Sahasrara. Cover you head, so that you won't have any problem. Also you must verify what sort of a person you are. 

If you have a liver problem, then you get a diet for that, which is here - people will tell you. If you left sided person, if you have left sided problem then you must know about the diet - what you have to take. For example a person who's a left sided should not taken carbohydrates at all. On the contrary, should eat proteins in whatever form it is possible. In Sahaja Yoga, you know, we don't believe in vegetarianism or anything but we do believe that the muscles of the bigger animals than us are not god for our teeth, or for our body also because the structure of a muscular cell of a biger animal is much bigger then ours. And that's how they eat up. I mean even by mistake if I eat something or anybody asked Me the other day - behind My teeth were swollen up. So that's what it happens. It is an automatic reaction. And we are not supposed to use plastics in our clothes. 

Also try to avoid - some percentage of plastic we may use, but not all time plastics and nylons. And also the food should not be eaten in plastics. You can eat it in paper - paper is all right, because it is - what you call - is good, does't matter. But you shouldn't eat in plastic, food, plastic with forks and spoons of plastic and… It's too much plastic in this country. So be careful because plastic is anti-God, it is anti-human life, it is anti-biological processes. So avoid plastics as far as possible. Be careful on that and also don't use made something out of absolute plastic. Like I've seen, I wanted to buy one pair of slippers for Myself - I couldn't get one in the whole of Europe. Because I didn't want a plastic. 

And if you wear that, then you develop all kinds of skin troubles, skin diseases - so be careful on that. There are so many other things we are to be careful about, and because we have found out that these things that are harmful that's why we have made it compulsory: that everyone of you must be careful. Because now you are become the temple of God. And the temple of God should be healthy. We don't want tubercular patients to go around as saints. Nobody is going to believe them. SY: You just tell them about sugar. Shri Mataji: Now there's another falsehood about - thank God is now broken - that the sugar is against our… growth and all that. Sugar is very important for attention. Especially people who suffer from liver. 

For example people who are thin, mostly suffer from liver trouble. For them sugar is so important that if they don't take sugar they'll become like the sugar cane which has come out of the machine, pressing machine, you see? Better take some sugar. Sugar is very important for your liver. Best carbohydrate is white sugar, not the red sugar. Red sugar is not good because it has got molasses - it's very heating. Some people have funny ideas here also about food. Like some of them believe that if you eat natural food - once I got something from natural store and I got diarrhea for five days. Because it was meant for animals not for the… human beings. Like some people eat, what you call them, [hindhi/marathi], Cotton seed! 

Now, cotton seed we give only to animals, you can't believe even. But I've seen in Switzerland, they give cotton seed in the bread. There was cotton seed in the bread. One or two is all right, but imagine, [hindhi/marathi]. [hindhi/marathi]. We can give it to buffaloes only. And that was given and you get diarrhea with it. You see, this's a very strong things. In the same way very soft food is also not good. We have to be in the centre in everything. 

Don't eat very rough food, you see like… some of the bread in France, you know, even in England we find, it breaks your gums completely. So that kind of a crispy stuff not need it. It should be such that your gums are looked after - they are delicate things and have food which is good for you. Don't go with nationality, don't go with the fashion but whatever is good for you that should be done. And you find out about yourself, what is your temperament, what sort of a food will soothe you and accordingly you should eat. Of course, everybody is free to do what they like but we can only advice them that this will soothe you, and you'll find it will be very helpful to all of you. It will help you. For you hair growth, also you should get vibrated oil and use it. Now, you'll be surprised the other day somebody saw Warren and he said, "This is the same fellow? Looks much younger. 

So I said, "Yes, he had a baldness from here to here, like that. And now he's grown hair. With proper care, you can have your hair quite intact for quite sometime - if you look after your hair. But hair is why important, is not so much look, but the Sahasrara. And if you put oil in your Sahasrara every week, you will have a smoothe personality, a smooth behavior, a smooth movement, you'll deal with other people in a gentle manner. So this is very necessary. In India we actually have a big masseur attached to a family, see - is a very hefty fellow. And he comes to massage the men, you see, he just sits on their body and really finishes them off completely. At the first shot they are dead. Then he uses their body fully and push it and sits on them and rubs them. 

With the, one clap - you see, five, six of them will be jumping on five, six people - with clap, they'll go round. By the time the second job comes in the person is finished. That's how they manage. But that, there's no importance of massaging here, you see. And don't ask a nonsahaja yogi to massage you. Never. Don't allow anybody to touch you that way. Because, you see, these people carry all bad vibrations and you may suffer. You must allow only the realized souls to massage you, if possible, or you, yourself should massage yourself. But don't go to this masseurs and people who are massaging all kinds of people and they might be given you some troubles. 

So one has to be very careful about certain things and certain person habits also, which we have discussed. And you can ask Warren, he will tell you about it, which are very important for Mooladhara and all those things, which must be followed, whether you are in England, America, anywhere. This must be followed to keep yourself clean outside and inside. Now, if you have any questions? SY: I was only wondering, Mataji, any kind of technique that we should do when massaging the children? But I guess that [unclear]. Shri Mataji: I mean any way you use is all right, but always put it a upwards, you see, The movement should be upward but use oil, otherwise you pull out their hair. So use oil to put it up first. SY: And don't forget the Sahasrara. Shri Mataji: Sahasrara don't forget, Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children. 

SY: Mother we gonna a need more hairdressers, people who can cut hair for us, realized souls, because they have us touching on our Sahasrara with the haircut. Shri Mataji: Yes, otherwise you can grow, what's the harm? SY: We can grow our hair Mother? Shri Mataji: Yes, here up to here you can grow and cut them round. See, you'll look like a philosopher, quite impressive. But you should not be a funny looking person, or a jocular personality. That's one thing very important, you see, you have not to adopt some funny methods, you see, like people have. Especially nowadays the fashion is to dishevel you hair and keep them absolutely disheveled. There is no need to… SY: Tell them to keep the hair out of the [unclear]. SY: The hair must be off the forehead. 

Shri Mataji: Yes! Should be kept back over the forehead. Don't cover your forehead, or your eyes - - never. SY: And also the Agya chakra will stay back. Shri Mataji: Yes. You must keep it open, you see, always open. Parted. You must have a central part if is possible, but keep the forehead open - is important. Keep the forehead open - is very good for others, you see, and don't cover your eyes with any hair. Many people have a habit of allowing the hair to come on the eyes, and you'll have squints. 

Children also, never allow hair to come on their eyes. Then we have some things for the eyes also, what you call Neetranjan - I don't have now anything. But is a very good simple thing, cost you nothing, about [Neetranjan] is just ten-eleven rupee, meaning how much here? One tenth of a dollar. All right, they have some, they'll give you, each is to be applied first very carefully If you are not use to it, it will little bit burn and the tears will start coming out of your eyes. It will clear your eyes. And you'll be surprised with that, if you use it, you don't develop these bags and things like that. And the water close out - is very simple thing. And for soap also, try to use natural soaps. Better is - because here the soaps are such, that I don't know what to say. 

SY: Palmolive, Mother. Palmolive I think is about the only soap you can get here. Shri Mataji: Yes, that is good, Palmolive. It's very good. Now, what else? SY: Jerusalem. SY: Mother, I have one question here. Shri Mataji: Yes. SY: Another question. SY: My son has [unclear] it's fluid in the ears. 

SY: Her son gets fluid in the ears. What can he do? Shri Mataji: All right, what you do it's to take a little oil and heat with some cloves. Cloves? SY: Cloves. Shri Mataji: Cloves, cloves. SY: No, cloves. Shri Mataji: Cloves. And let the oil be little bit cooled down. When is quite cooled down, not, should not be burning hot at all, but just warm - you can feel it - then put it in the ears. 

SY: Olive oil? Shri Mataji: Olive oil is all right. But do it quite often. So what happens, that the oil goes inside and the fluid comes out. SY: Mother, could you explain to them the significance of vibrated sugar and vibrated salt and that giving vibrations to these things. They don't quite understand the significance of vibrating everything. Shri Mataji: You see, because God has given you vibrations, the power is flowing through you now. The vibrations are there. So whatever you get from outside is touched by so many people, so many people have created it and they haven't got a good mind or maybe something wrong with them. Best thing is to give them a bandhan before eating. 

Any food you eat, you must give the bandhan like this, three times, so your vibrations flow into the food and you get it sanctified. Or else, you can also use your hands for eating. If you have washed your hands then it's all right. Or else, if you are taking the water, you can just put your hands - then it gets vibrated, then drink it. Because, the thing is, the vibrations have starting flowing through your hands but still have not spread to your body fully. SY: When you are vibrating food, you can actually feel hot food emitting a cool breeze - it's quite remarkable. Shri Mataji: Even, even you'll find cool breeze from a candle. SY: What's this? It's water or what? SY - Yeah, water, and the other one is [unclear]. 

SY: [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: What is this? SY: It's water. Shri Mataji: Is it cold. SY: Yes, it's cold. Shri Mataji: [hindhi/marathi]. SM - [hindhi/marathi]. Shri Mataji: Yes. So, now we'll sing that Jerusalem. SY: Yes. 

Shri Mataji: And then the aarti. One aarti he'll sing of Dhatatreya and then the aarti, our own. Sit down. Sit down. Stand up. All of you have to stand up. Come along, all of you stand up here. Looks very nice. The little children should be here. SY: All the, all the children. 

Shri Mataji: All the children. SY: We stand up anywhere? Shri Mataji: This side. SY - Over here. SM - Or there. There will be better. SY: Not near the microphone. May God bless you all. Shri Mataji: May God bless you all! Now, tomorrow I would like to see the new people and doing the meditation here. 

New people, who have not been before to our any other programs. SY: Did you all hear that? Mother would like to see all the new people that have never been to any of the regular meditation programs before, to come here for the morning meditation and after the morning meditation She'll see you all. Shri Mataji: New York and Boston and anywhere, they are coming for the first time. SY: Those who are coming for the first time…
