You see, in India, we have like different families for music.

Like kiran guana agrana all kinds of garranas we have. The specialty of Maharashtra is [?]. Is the music that they sing In the dramas in the [?] you have heard her singing so all the time. The actor is standing and singing, actress is standing and singing. They have to remember by heart everything and it's a very fast number, always a very, very fast number uh it's not easy to sing those songs, so I requested her to at least sing one song from Nati Sangeet because that's the essence of Maharashtraan music. After this Great Music programme, I don't know what to say in words. But I must say they are all Sahaja Yogis. They have come to Sahaja Yoga, they have got the realisation. And all these great artists are now coming to Sahaja Yoga so easily.

It's, they are our family. And the closeness we feel for them you can see it in the music even if you don't understand the words. The way you see they penetrate into your being because they are Sahaja Yogis. And the also, the Songs they have chosen were very, very remarkable and beautiful. I really don't know how to thank they are my children. I don't know what to say, but the only thing I say that you should continue with your music. And all my blessings, not only that, but I would do anything to spread this music all over the world, and we have now. And we have now such an audience. Such a musical audience, you can see that. And such a report was established.

Shows that this Divine music will be eternal and eternally spreading all over. May God bless you all the listeners and also the musicians. May God bless.
