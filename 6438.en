Public Program, Malaysya, 26 April 1994.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot conceptualize it, we cannot describe it, and unfortunately, at this human awareness, we cannot know it. Something more has to happen to us and at that stage, what we call as self-realization, knowing the Spirit, that we can really know the truth.

Whatever I'm going to tell you today you have to know it that your blind faith is not going to help you. We've had enough of problems because of blind faith. So you have to just keep your mind open like scientists and see for yourself. Treat this as a hypothesis, and if you find that it is true, what I'm saying has been proved, then as honest people you must accept it. Because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your family, of your country and the world at large.

Most of the human problems that come to us are because of these centers. When these centers are in trouble we get the human problems and all the world problems mostly come from human beings. So what do we find that if a human being is all right within we can make the whole world all right.

At the outset I have to tell you what is the truth. The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, but you are the Pure Spirit. You're not this ego, intelligence but you are the pure Spirit. This is the first truth about you. And the second one is that you see all these flowers so beautifully placed before you, they are a miracle in a way, because we can't explain how they are different, grow at a different temperature, how they're different in their heights and colors and fragrance. How these are happening, we never think. All these living things, for example, who runs your heart? So doctors will say that autonomous nervous system, but who is this 'auto', they can't answer. So the science cannot answer this question. Science is limited, it cannot answer, it cannot say why are we on this earth, why have we come on this earth?

So the second truth is there is a subtle living power which is the Divine Love which does all the living work. All the religions have talked about it, all the religions have said that you must get your self-realization, your second birth, in different, different ways. And all the religions have said that there is this subtle power of Divine Love which is formless. But as it is, religions were not so much Spirit-oriented; they were either money-oriented or power-oriented and fighting among themselves. In the name of God they're fighting because if they are the Spirit they won't fight. Because then they will realize they're part and parcel of the whole, they're all one, all these religions were born on the same Tree of Spirituality, but we have plucked the flowers and we're fighting with the dead flowers. All the people who created these great religions never treated them separately. We have done a mistake by not understanding the unity we're having. We'll be happy to see all the people sitting here are coming from different races, from different religions, from different countries. Sahaja Yoga now is working in sixty countries.

Mostly what's wrong with human beings is that, that he does not know where to find satisfaction. Sometimes he thinks that in money he'll find satisfaction, sometimes he thinks in power, sometimes in some sort of a love or sometimes in the family or some sort of very limited, superficial things. But it's not, because you know that according to economic laws wants are not satiable in general; means, today you want a house, so you'll buy a house. Then you won't be satisfied. If that was a pure desire you should have been satisfied. Then you want to buy a car, still you're not satisfied. Then you want to buy furniture, then the carpet, then the aeroplane, I don't know what, but whatever you may buy you're not satisfied with what you buy. That means this is not the pure desire.

Now what is the pure desire within us, if you're wanting to know, I will tell you. Whether you're aware of it or not, there's only one pure desire we have, is to be one with this all-pervading Divine Power. Like this instrument if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. In the same way, we have no identity, we have no personality, we don't know why are we on this earth because we're not connected to the mains.

Sahaja, Saha means with, with and Ja is born. Is born with you the right to be united, yoga, with this Divine Power. This is Sahaja Yoga. You don't have to leave your family, you don't have to go to Himalayas standing on your heads, you don't have to fast and do all kinds of monkey tricks. It is within you, it is within you. Like Guru Nanaka said, . But who does that? What he said, we just go on reading, reading, reading but do we do that? We have to know ourselves, we have to have self-knowledge. 

In the ancient times, fourteen thousand years back in India, Markandeya wrote about it, that we have a Kundalini within us and she's to be awakened. But that was in Sanskrit language, so many people did not know. Then in the sixth century Adi Shankaracharya very clearly wrote about it but that was also in Sanskrit language. In the twelfth century only Gyaneshwara himself wrote it very clearly in Marathi language in his book Gyaneshwari but the people in charge of religion said, "Don't read this sixth chapter," where they described the Kundalini. But in the twelfth and sixteenth century, we had great, great saints in our country who wrote about. Like Kabira said, . He says here on the fontanelle bone the sound of anahatha you can hear, ida, pingala, means three nadis he described. But nobody understands him, nobody understands, nobody understood Adi Shankaracharya, nobody understood Kabira. He says, . All these things were said so clearly, in all the languages whether you take Tamil, you take Sanskrit or you take Marathi or Punjabi or any other language, Bangla. All languages it was described in our country, what we are doing is our heritage, is the heritage of the Indians. 

Also, Buddha has talked about it, also this Mother Mercy that they worship, Chinese, they too have, to describe about it, like Tao. Like Tao has talked, Tao means Kundalini, can you imagine, Tao means Kundalini. Zen system has talked about Kundalini. So there's no place where I find, even two hundred years back we had William Blake in England, he has talked about it. But we don't want to know, we just avoid it, but what a thing to avoid. This all our property, it is all within us. All these powers are within us and we're missing it out. 

By the raising of the Kundalini, what happens? First of all she nourishes all these centers and these centers look after your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. So first thing that happens to you is all your powers of creativity, powers of religion. We talk of religion, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and all that religion, but anybody can commit any mistake, any sin. They may say we're this, they may be fanatics but everybody is capable of committing sins of killing each other or doing something wrong, nobody is awakened, because the religion is not awakened within them. Once the religion is awakened within the personality you become a saint and a saint can never do wrong. 

That is the chance you have now, the time has come, this is a special time, we call it the blossom time. And the Christian religion describe as the Last Judgment. In every religion, Islam has talked about Qiyamah. So clearly Mohamad Sahib has said that 'your hands will speak.' This is exactly what happens. In Sahaja Yoga that on your hands you can feel this all-pervading power, you can feel the cool breeze coming out from your Brahmarandhra, from your Taloo, what you call the fontanelle bone area. You can feel it yourself, and this is your own power, again I must tell you that there's no obligation. 

It's like one enlightened light can enlighten another light. When you're enlightened, you can enlighten other people. Also one must understand that you cannot pay for living work. Nobody can pay to Mother Earth anything for giving us these beautiful flowers, she doesn't understand money. So you cannot pay for it, you can pay for the hall but not for your self-realization. It has to be absolutely away from this money nonsense. God doesn't understand money, it's human headache. So those people who go on asking for money, there're many we had, false people who came from my country and from other countries, making money, minting money, teaching dirty things, there's nothing to be taught. You have to have the experience, experience of your spirit and experience of this Divine Power. Once you have this experience then you'll be surprised to know that how all your problems get solved. First you become in a state which we call as the peaceful state because the thoughts on which we jump are coming from the future or the past but nothing from the present. When the Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts and we are placed in the state of present which is reality and no thought. It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi in Sanskrit language.

The second state where we reach is called as doubtless awareness. This is the first one is the thoughtless awareness, the second one is doubtless awareness. This comes to you in no time but you have to be honest and you have to have faith in yourself. It works so fast, you'll be amazed how many blessings people have got out of Sahaja Yoga. Everyday they're telling Me, "Mother we've got this, this happened, that happened," endless. Because this all-pervading power is the ocean of bliss, is ocean of bliss. We talk of bliss, now the time has come for us to experience the bliss. We just believe in God but we are not sure. Here you can experience the Divine, you can feel the Divine and you will know that it is that. Gradually you'll be amazed at yourself that your attention will become absolutely pure. 

Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." How many people are like that in the West where the Christian religion is followed. You won't find many. This happens to you, just happens to you. Get rid of all your bad habits. I will never say, "Don't do this," and "Don't do that," because half of you will go away. But it will just happen. You'll be amazed that I've seen so many people give up their drug addiction overnight. Of course, physically you'll improve. There have been many cases of blood cancer and all that have been improved and there are three doctors, I'm sorry, four doctors in Delhi who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga. They were MBBS doctors, they got their MD. So now scientifically it's been proved.

As I said it is your own power. You have to just know how to keep it up and how to use it for your own purpose, for the purpose of the whole world. That's all if you know it works out. Above all you jump into the ocean of joy, . All this is said, I mean, I'm not saying anything new. Only thing is now it is the experience, the proof, that's all I have. You drop into the ocean of joy. Joy is not double-faced like happiness and unhappiness. When your ego is pampered you feel happy, when it is punctured you feel unhappy. It's not like that. Joy is the state in which you become a witness, sakshi, you start seeing everything as a sakshi. You see the whole thing as a drama and you enjoy it. Such dynamism comes to you, at the same time great compassion. 

You see, My age, they must have told you I am seventy-one years of age, I'll be seventy-two now. And I'm traveling practically every third day. How do I manage? Because I never think I travel, I never think I travel. I'm just enjoying every part of it and that's what you become. You become great artistes. You must have heard of Amjad Ali, you must have heard of other great, many people who came to Sahaja Yoga became great artistes. Musicians, not only musicians, artists, painters, all kinds of things, architects, people have achieved so many things in Sahaja Yoga. But they're humble people, they don't talk, they don't boast. This is what it is. It's a very simple thing that should happen to you, it takes no time, no money, no problems.

I'm sure it is going to happen here, only thing I've to tell you that you have to have full faith in yourself, just faith in yourself, that's all, nothing more is needed and it will work out in no time, I can tell you this. This will give you such peace that you'll never have stress and strain and all these modern diseases that people are suffering from. Every disease and all that can be easily controlled through Sahaja Yoga. We have patients who had very horrible diseases who are absolutely cured without going to any doctor or anything. The best part of it that you all can feel the same thing on your finger tips. Supposing if you have ten children who're realized souls and they, put before them, close their eyes, put before them somebody, and they will tell, "Oh, he has the same problem." If they say, "This finger is burning," means he has a heart problem. You ask him, "Have you got a heart problem?" "Yes, how do you know?" The children know.

Everybody starts seeing the same thing, this is the point, knowing the same thing. Because you know the absolute truth. If you know the absolute truth there is no relativity left, what is there to quarrel about then. Here you have this theory, that theory, that another ism and this ism and this ism, no, you all know the same absolute truth. 

Like that in sixty nations we have now, specially in Russia, Sahaja Yoga has brought the best. They have thrown away all false gurus and everything but America which is a very materialistic country is a poor show, now they're coming, after hit by Rajneesh and this and that, they're coming to Sahaja Yoga. Doesn't matter, whatever it is, we have to say that we want the truth, and those who don't want the truth I've nothing to do. I'm not here to give you these diamonds, so-called, and this vibhuti and all that. That's all nonsense and now thank God one fellow has been exposed completely. And it has been in the newspaper that this man was giving vibhuti from the smeshana. All these tricks are pretavidya, smeshanavidya, you know very well, all of them you know this and this should not be done at any cost. I was told that Malaysia is full of it. It's very surprising. You're all intelligent people, how could you accept this nonsense of bhootavidya and pretavidya. What you have to ask , the one who talks about God and God-realization and self-realization is the only one who is the real guru. Otherwise those who are making money and showing you tricks are not. Try to understand. It's something artificial you're running after and then you suffer so much.

I'm here to tell you that you have to be honest about yourself, that's all. And it will all work out. I know you all have questions, doesn't matter, whatever questions you have you can write to Me and we'll answer you. Only thing about Sahaja Yoga is that it is not an individual growth. You cannot grow in your house, you have to come to the collective , you have to be in the collective. Like if my one nail is cut out, it won't grow. Whatever is the place, whatever is the area where you have to go, you have to go there, all of you and you have to grow. It would be something like sprouting the seed but the seed has to grow and it should not be that a sprouted seed is wasted. You must have respect of yourself, of self-realization, of yourself, and you must grow into it. Then you will understand whatever religion you're following, then you will understand the greatness of all these prophets, gurus, satgurus and the incarnations. Without that you cannot understand the unity that exists within them. Like, to understand histology you have to use microscope. In the same way to understand all these great people who have created beautiful religions for us we have to use Sahaja Yoga.

I'm very happy that so many of you have come here but I hope you will not just come listen to Me like, you see, guru-shopping, listening to Mother, then next time there, and then there. This kind of people cannot achieve anything. But I know people have achieved a lot in Sahaja Yoga. I'm very happy to see people from all over, from Madras, also from Kerala, also from Punjab. I've been all over there and I was amazed everywhere such a response, such an understanding was there. Of course it's growing much more in Delhi and in UP, also Haryana has taken over very much. I don't know, I never expected that it would grow like that because I was busy outside, working out but I started only three years back really in the real sense of the word and the north has taken over. The south is still little ritualistic, I would say, it is not compared to the north, they have taken it. They'll sing the songs of God, Goddess, Devi, they're Devi bhaktas or they're this and that. But to take to Sahaja Yoga you have to understand that no ritual is needed, no ritual, just you get it within yourself, it's within you. And that's what you have to get it. 

I hope this will work out tonight. If somebody doesn't want it, I respect your freedom, you should go away. It cannot be forced on you, I cannot force on you. So those who do not want should go away. It will take hardly ten minutes for you, but those who do not want to have realization, it cannot be forced, I'm sorry to say. So it is important that those who do not want should go away, go away from the hall. Will be very civil of them to do so. It will not harm you, it will not trouble you by any chance, these are all wrong ideas which have been spread by people who don't know how to awaken the Kundalini and who don't want people to have their self-realization. So don't believe them.

There are three conditions which are very simple. First of all you should not feel in any way guilty. You should not feel, "I've done this wrong, I've done that wrong." At this moment you should not feel you're guilty. When you go on feeling guilty what happens that this center on the left goes out of order. And when it goes out of order you get a disease called angina or you may get spondylitis, you might get cervical cancer, you might also get very lethargic organs. So why to have guilt? It is a myth. If you have done any mistake just face it, but why do you carry on with a myth like this to ruin your health and at this juncture when the Kundalini is rising if this chakra is caught up it won't be able to pierce through. So please don't torture yourself with the idea that you are guilty. You're not guilty in the eyes of God, you're human beings. Only human beings can make mistakes, you're not gods, so please be pleasantly placed towards yourself firstly. 

Second condition is this that you have to forgive everyone. Some people say it is very difficult to forgive. But just see logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do? Nothing. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself while the person who has made you unhappy is a happy person, and you're torturing yourself. So what's the use of feeling guilty, or what's the use of not forgiving? Best is to forgive all of them, don't even think about them, it's a headache. Just in general you have to forgive. I'll tell you how to do that.

Now this center here on the optic chiasma in the brain is like this, very constricted. It's called as Agnya chakra and if you do not forgive then it won't open, but if you forgive, it opens. That means at this important time you should really forgive so that it opens and you get your realization.

Third condition is request from Me and believe Me that you must have faith in yourself, complete faith that you'll get your realization tonight. You shouldn't say, "How can I get," you will get it. You have to get it, just have faith in yourself that you'll get your self-realization. It's very important. This faith is extremely important and it will work out, I'm sure it will work out. 

There's something very simple is, I hope you people don't mind if I request you to take out your shoes because you know this Mother Earth helps us a lot. If you tell to English people they'll walk out. They don't want to take out their shoes.

Now as I told you, you're going to get your self-realization here on your seat but you have to sit comfortably, should not be uncomfortable, not very much bending behind or in front but comfortably and have faith in yourself. Now please put both the feet away from each other. 

Those who have to go should really go now and when we're doing this they should not move about, please.

Now, there is a left and a right side, Ida and Pingala, two nadis are there. These are two powers within us, one is a power of desire and another is the power of action. That's why we keep both the legs apart from each other like this. You have to put your left hand towards Me like this. That is to suggest symbolically that you desire to have your self-realization, on your lap. Just keep it on your left lap. Now with this you desire to have self-realization and with the right hand you act, in the sense you nourish your own centers. You need not remember it, it's only today, tonight we're doing it. 

So please put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So you put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. You're working only on the left hand side. Everyone has to do it. This is the center of mastery which is created by great prophets and great masters which we have to awaken. Now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side again. Put your left hand and right hand in the lower portion. This is the center surprisingly, is the center of Divine knowledge, so low as that. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. As I told you this is the center of mastery. Raise your right hand now on top of your heart. This is the center of where resides the Spirit. Now please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And turn your head to your right. This is the center, as I told you already, goes into jeopardy when you feel guilty. Now please take your hand, right hand on top of your forehead across and please bend your head back. This is the center where you've to forgive everyone in general. Now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as fas as possible. This is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading Divine Power. Now, the last center is very important. Stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, and bend it, bend your head. Now , bend your head. This is the place where the Kundalini has to pierce through. Now you've to move your scalp slowly, scalp, not hand so much, scalp, seven times, slowly. That's all you have to do. One thing, you didn't bend your heads, some of you, you should bend your heads. Now this is what we have to do. You can take out your glasses because you have to close your eyes. But before that you can put both the feet away from each other, both the feet away from each other and put your left hand on your lap, that's all.

Now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you, please close your eyes. Put you right hand now please on your heart. Here you've to ask a very fundamental question about yourself three times. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. "Mother, am I the Spirit?" In your heart, ask this question three times. "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Now, please know that if you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So now please take down your right hand, upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side, and here you ask another fundamental question, press it hard. "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times again. Please don't feel guilty, don't feel guilty. As I told you I respect your freedom, I cannot force pure divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it, and here you ask six times, because this center has got six petals. "Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge." Ask six times "Mother, please give me pure pure divine knowledge." As long as you ask for divine knowledge the Kundalini starts rising. So now we have to nourish our higher centers with our full self-knowledge. Please, now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. And here you have to say ten times with full self-confidence, "Mother, I am my own master." At the very outset I've told you that you are not this mind, this ego, this body, emotions, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and ask twelve times, "Mother, am I the pure Spirit?" This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of compassion and bliss but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and it forgives whatever mistakes you might have committed. So please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and put your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." Sixteen times you have to say with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." I have already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands, specially at this time it is very important to forgive, so that this Agnya chakra will open. So now please take your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head. Here you have to say, not how many times but from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Don't think about them, say it from your heart. Please bend your head. Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head. Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to say again from your heart, not how many times, "O Divine Power, if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." Say it from your heart, "O divine Power, if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." Push back your head as far as possible. Now, please take down your hand and now stretch your palm. Put the center of your palm on the soft bone, taloo, which was in your childhood the fontanelle bone area. Put the center of your palm. Now important is to push back your fingers so that you get a good pressure on your scalp. Here again, bend your head again, bend your head properly, that's very important. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for self-realization. So move your scalp slowly clockwise seven times, saying seven times, "Mother, please give me self-realization." Saying seven times, "Mother, please give me self-realization."

Now please take down your hands, open your eyes. Now put this left hand towards Me and right hand like this. Now with the right hand towards Me please put down your head and see with the left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head, right hand towards Me, please try to understand, right hand towards Me, right, right hand. And bend your head, now see, bend your head and see if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like sensation coming from your head. Now don't doubt, there's no conditioner in your head, so just see. The hand should not be on top of the head, it should be away from it. Some people get very further, some nearer the head. Try to move your hand and see for yourself if you're getting any cold or a hot breeze-like sensation. Now, put the left hand towards Me like this, left hand. Now put the head again down and see for yourself. If there is hot, means you have not forgiven. So you please forgive, you'll get it cool. Bend your head properly and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like sensation coming from your head. Now, again once again, please put your right hand towards Me. Bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like sensation coming from your fontanelle bone area. Put both the hands like this towards Me. Keep your eyes open just like this, above, little higher, and now, don't think, you can do it, watch Me without thinking. Watch Me without thinking. 

Raise both your hands, all of them. May God bless you.

You all have reached saintliness. This is what it is but you have to keep it up. Some people did not feel, doesn't matter. You have to come to the collective and you all can feel it, it is your right. You were doubting yourself, I think, most probably that's why it has not worked out. But there's nothing to doubt, nothing to doubt. You are born at a time which I call as blossom time. It's a special time of resurrection when these things were to happen and it's happening to you.

I hope you'll continue with it, work it out collectively and try to make a very collective, beautiful organism of human beings. This is the new race that has come up and it has to be, we all have to be united, we all have to be one and I'm sure they will all see the point. You'll be surprised there are so many Muslim leaders now who are coming to Sahaja Yoga. There's one called Ayatollah Rohani from Iran. His brother now elected as the premier there, he's coming to Sahaja Yoga. Our commander in chief has come, India, has come to Sahaja Yoga. So they have to come because there is no peace, then how are they to exist without peace, without joy. What everybody has said, even Mohamad Sahib has said that you have to be a wali, you have to be a realized soul. All of you have to be that. That's the last break-through of our evolution, it should happen to all of us. 

Thank you very much.

May God bless you all.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
