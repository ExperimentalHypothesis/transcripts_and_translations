It was a very successful program I must say, a lot of people they have got their Realization but the lecture was also very well done. So, it\'s all nice, I\'m very happy with today\'s program.\nSahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!\nSahaja Yogis: Jai!\nShri Mataji: May God bless you.\nSo good night everyone.\nSahaja Yogis: Good night Shri Mataji.\n\n[Cut in the audio]\nShri Mataji: Here, it\'s the road which is about thirty feet wide [10 meters], which looks like a little line here.\nYou can all see later on. Now, this road comes on this hill which is on top. And then from there, you see this valley, so big, you can\'t walk it\'s too big. From this side, flows a brook and there\'s a river flowing from this side. And this river goes and meets Vaitarna. And the river Vaitarna word is used always in the "shastras", in the scriptures as Bhavasagara.\nSahaja Yogini: [Translates in French: which means the Ocean]\nShri Mataji: Of Illusion.\nSo, "vai" means the Bhavasagara "tarana" means to cross over.\n[ The Sahaja Yogini does not understand]\nShri Mataji: "Vai" means the Bhavasagara "vai".\nSahaja Yogini: Yes.\nShri Mataji: "Vai".\nSahaja Yogini: "Vai".\nShri Mataji: "Vai". And "tarana" means the one that allows you to cross. "Vai \xe2\x80\x93 tarana".\nI mean you will notice this that in India everything has a name and a symbol within. And it has a meaning, always it has a meaning. Now, you can see this for yourself now, for children.\nShri Mataji: Look at the smile. [Shri Mataji laughs]\n[Yogis pass the photo of a drawing.]\n\nBut there are more trees than this, much more. This artist didn\'t show them because he said he wants to give an aerial view, so he didn\'t want to show so many trees. But the artist has not seen the place, just through inspiration he has done it.\nSahaja Yogini: [Translates in French: the artist did not see the place]\nShri Mataji: No!\nI just drew out and showed him and he just made it. He\'s a Sahaja Yogi.\n[Laughter]\n\nSahaja Yogi: We wanted the Swiss to take this and take it back to Arnaud but people didn\'t take it [Inaudible]\nShri Mataji: It has to go to Arnaud.\nSahaja Yogi: The photograph to Arnaud.\nShri Mataji: Who will take it? Raise your hands, to Arnaud.\nSahaja Yogi: Oh, maybe Marie can take it.\nShri Mataji: Yes, she\'s here. Who could be more reliable than her?\nShri Mataji: So now, I make a move. I say goodbye to you because I think if you are all coming you might land good but I wanted to go a little bit in the city and I\'ll have something to eat there, not much, I, with the children, had "channas" and everything. Then, we\'ll meet at the airport if possible, those who are coming.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Can we have the mantra, can we say the mantra?\n\n[Sahaja Yogis say the three great mantras]\nShri Mataji: May God bless you.\nSahaja Yogi: Bolo Shri Mata Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!\nSahaja Yogis: Jai!\n\nShri Mataji: Warren?\nWarren: Yes Shri Mataji.\nShri Mataji: Can you bring the shopping I did.\nExcept for the small ones. All the treatise.\n\nShri Mataji: May God bless you.\nMay God bless you.\nSo I have some small presents for you all. Without the price.\nThat\'s for Kinsley for doing such a good job.\n[Applause.]\n\nI hope there is no price there. Is it a price? Just see [Inaudible]\nSahaja Yogi: No, it\'s not a price Mother.\nShri Mataji: So, this one\'s for Ruth.\n[Applause.]\nKinsley: How did you know Mother, it\'s probably the most I needed, a lovely watch, in those days. I really wanted to bow. It\'s beautiful.\nShri Mataji: I told him: "You have to have\xc2\xa0pearls because it\'s cooling down." 12:56\nAll right.\n[Laughter]\nShri Mataji: And this one is for Christine.\n[Applause.]\nCome along, I\'ll make you wear. I\'m not very good at all these things. I don\'t know how you do it if there\'s a double thing here. It\'s a double one, double latch.\n[Applause.]\n\nHow did you wear?\nCome along, I\'ll make you wear.\nSahaja Yogi: I like this Shri Mataji, absolutely.\nThank you so much.\nShri Mataji: [Laughter] Wear it now.\nSahaja Yogi: It seems too beautiful.\nShri Mataji: It suits you all right, I have to tell you.\nYes.\nSahaja Yogi: Now, Shri Mataji, Mickael. [In a very low voice]\nShri Mataji: Oh, so beautiful! He looks so nice.\n[Laughter. Applause]\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the mother\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure.\nIt has a double latch, you see? So I\xe2\x80\x99m taking out just one and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put on the one and the new one you have to do. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s for the safety. So, it should not fall off it has a double latch.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, may God bless you.\n[Applause.]\nMay God bless you. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see and have it also.\nOh, you have put on weight I must say.\n[Laughter]\nYes, good, good, very good.\nMay God bless you. So thank you very much.\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, thank you.\nSahaja Yogi: Thank you Mother.\nShri Mataji: May God bless you, thank you.\nI hope there\xe2\x80\x99s no price in that thing.\nSahaja Yogi: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99ve checked Mother.\nNo, I had a look on it.\nShri Mataji: There?\nSahaja Yogi: Yes, no,no, no, it was on the others but not on this one, I\xe2\x80\x99ve checked for you.\nShri Mataji: Thank you very much.\n[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]\nSahaja Yogi: Thank you for coming Mother.\nShri Mataji: May God bless you all. May God bless you all.\nSo, here we go.\nSomebody is really unhappy, you can see that.\nYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t we keep it inside that one in the box? And you want to lock it up also that thing.\nSahaja Yogi: Bolo Shri Jagadamba Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!\nSahaja Yogis: Jai!\nShri Mataji:\xc2\xa0Guido, let Me know, all right?\nGuido: Yes, Shri Mataji; about Diwali? Diwali in Rome?\nShri Mataji:\xc2\xa0Diwali in Rome.\n[Applause]\n[End of Shri Mataji\xe2\x80\x99s talk. From 17:54 minutes, Yogis speak together]'
