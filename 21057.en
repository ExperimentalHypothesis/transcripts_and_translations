Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – VERIFIED

Immediately contact Gavin and tell him how many are going and they must have proper arrangements. Because, you see that, England is a funny place. Wherever you get the place for Navaratri, I’ll be there. Whether it is in France or in Switzerland or anywhere. Keep it like that. Because they take it for granted, they just take it for granted. English are like that, you see, you have to little bit put them on the competition. Because I think they’ve had too much of Me and don’t realise what it is. There are some very good ones, no doubt, some very, very excellent people but some of them do really take it for granted. I think that you have to handle it that way, I mean inform the English that if you cannot do it, let’s do it somewhere else. So, I think it will be done because it is only next week but there must have been some arrangements made because they wanted to have a big program on some day, organise a very, very big programme – Warren?

Warren - That’s on the 28th November 

When is this puja?

Warren – 20th October.

Anywhere, I don’t mind, but only thing is that all of you should be comfortable and there should be sufficient place for all of you to be there together. I don’t know if they are aware how many people are coming, I don’t think. But I have a feeling that this might be the last puja here in the West and there will be many who will be coming.

There’s no need for you to come to Frankfurt. We can see how we manage. It’s alright I’ll manage the Frankfurt Fair.

First time when we came to London there was such a   fog in London that we had to get down in Frankfurt. And, you see, the people couldn’t get their food for about eighteen hours. And there were four, five hippies, who were very hungry, on the same table we were both sitting. I’m sure they must have taken some hashish, so, you see, I started looking after them. And I would go and get them butter and cheese and this and that from the counter, you see, for them to eat. And they were eating, and polishing off everything, Polishing off everything. And my husband also joined them but he gave up very fast. And they were still saying, “More, more.” I didn’t know what to do, they were eating and eating and eating. But I was happy because I liked to feed them, I liked them very much. Then I went again to get something from the counter and I found that [INAUDIBLE] had run away. He just ran away, you see. When I came back, they said, “What happened?” and I said, “He has run away.” “Has he taken everything?” I said, “Yes, there’s nothing there now, it’s finished.” So that was the first introduction. Because my husband said, “You’ll be very happy here because people eat so well.” That’s Frankfurt. I hope there will not be repetition of the same experience. Better if you people don’t come there, maybe you will have hard times. Because after all, you see, I hope I don’t meet some hippies there again. Fingers crossed.

So, I’m looking forward to this book fair also, my attention will be there. And you all should give it a bandhan as well because our book is for sale there. And another thing is that Navaratri is very good because these nine nights represent the main nine incarnations where the Goddess took the form of Shakti and killed the negative people. But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathised. So this is what one has to understand, that don’t sympathise with negativity. You’ll spoil them all. And always you’ll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative. Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker. So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it’s so troublesome and so disgusting. So to help me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That’s how you can help Me the most. This is what it is the Navaratri, the Puja that I give you powers to fight the negativity. That’s how you cure people. May God bless you.

[Sahaja Yogis say the three great mantras]

 Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.

Today’s programme was very successful and I hope the same thing will happen in Frankfurt. It was a very successful programme I must say, a lot of people they have got their Realisation but the lecture was also very well done. So, it’s all nice, I’m very happy for today’s programme.

[Applause.]

I hope there is no price there. Is it a price? Just see [Inaudible]
Patrick: No, it’s not a price Mother.
Shri Mataji: So, this one’s for Ruth.
[Applause.]
Kingsley: How did you know Mother, it’s what we wanted the most, I needed a watch and Ruth really wanted some pearls. It’s beautiful.

Shri Mataji: I told him: “You have to have pearls because it’s cooling down.” 
All right.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: And this one is for Christine.
[Applause.]
Come along, I’ll make you wear it. I’m not very good at all these things. I don’t know how you do it if there’s a double thing here. It’s a double one, double latch.
[Applause.]

How did you wear?
Come along, I’ll make you wear.
Kingsley: I like this Shri Mataji, absolutely.
Thank you so much.
Shri Mataji: [Laughter] Wear it now.
Kingsley: It seems too beautiful.
Shri Mataji: It fits you all right, I have to tell you.
Yes.
Shri Mataji: Oh, so beautiful! He looks so nice.
[Laughter. Applause]
That’s the mother’s pleasure.
It has a double latch, you see? So I’m taking out just one and I’ll put on the one and the next one you have to do. I think it’s for the safety. So, it should not fall off it has a double latch.
It’s good, may God bless you.
[Applause.]
May God bless you. Let’s see and have it also.
Oh, you have put on weight I must say.
[Laughter]
Yes, good, good, very good.
May God bless you. So thank you very much.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, thank you.
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you Mother.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you, thank you.
I hope there’s no price in that thing.
Patrick: No, no, I’ve checked Mother.
No, I had a look on it.
Shri Mataji: There?
Patrick: Yes, no,no, no, it was on the others but not on this one, I’ve checked for you.
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

So, here we go.
Somebody is really unhappy, you can see that.
Yes, that’s all. Why didn’t we keep it inside that one in the box? And you want to lock it up also that thing.
