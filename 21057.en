May God bless you all.

Today's program was very successful for us and I hope the same thing will happen in Frankfurt. It was a very successful program I must say, a lot of people they have got their Realization but the lecture was also very well done. So, it's all nice, I'm very happy with today's program.
Sahaja Yogi:  Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!
Sahaja Yogis: Jai!
Shri Mataji:  May God bless you.
So good night everyone.
Sahaja Yogis:  Good night Shri Mataji.

[Cut in the audio]
Shri Mataji: Here, it's the road which is about thirty feet wide [10 meters], which looks like a little line here.
You can all see later on. Now, this road comes on this hill which is on top. And then from there, you see this valley, so big, you can't walk it's too big. From this side, flows a brook and there's a river flowing from this side. And this river goes and meets Vaitarna.  And the river Vaitarna word is used always in the "shastras", in the scriptures as Bhavasagara.
Sahaja Yogini: [Translates in French: which means the Ocean]
Shri Mataji:  Of Illusion.
So, "vai" means the Bhavasagara "tarana" means to cross over.
[ The Sahaja Yogini does not understand]
Shri Mataji: "Vai" means the Bhavasagara "vai".
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: "Vai".
Sahaja Yogini: "Vai".
Shri Mataji: "Vai". And "tarana" means the one that allows you to cross. "Vai – tarana".
I mean you will notice this that in India everything has a name and a symbol within. And it has a meaning, always it has a meaning. Now, you can see this for yourself now, for children.
Shri Mataji: Look at the smile. [Shri Mataji laughs]
[Yogis pass the photo of a drawing.]

But there are more trees than this, much more. This artist didn't show them because he said he wants to give an aerial view, so he didn't want to show so many trees. But the artist has not seen the place, just through inspiration he has done it.
Sahaja Yogini: [Translates in French: the artist did not see the place]
Shri Mataji: No!
I just drew out and showed him and he just made it. He's a Sahaja Yogi.
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: We wanted the Swiss to take this and take it back to Arnaud but people didn't take it [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: It has to go to Arnaud.
Sahaja Yogi: The photograph to Arnaud.
Shri Mataji: Who will take it? Raise your hands, to Arnaud.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, maybe Marie can take it.
Shri Mataji: Yes, she's here. Who could be more reliable than her?
Shri Mataji: So now, I make a move. I say goodbye to you because I think if you are all coming you might land good but I wanted to go a little bit in the city and I'll have something to eat there, not much, I, with the children, had "channas" and everything.  Then, we'll meet at the airport if possible, those who are coming.

Sahaja Yogi: Can we have the mantra, can we say the mantra?

[Sahaja Yogis say the three great mantras]
Shri Mataji:  May God bless you.
Sahaja Yogi:  Bolo Shri Mata Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!
Sahaja Yogis: Jai!

Shri Mataji:  Warren?
Warren: Yes Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Can you bring the shopping I did.
Except for the small ones. All the treatise.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
May God bless you.
So I have some small presents for you all. Without the price.
That's for Kinsley for doing such a good job.
[Applause.]

I hope there is no price there. Is it a price? Just see [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: No, it's not a price Mother.
Shri Mataji: So, this one's for Ruth.
[Applause.]
Kinsley: How did you know Mother, it's probably the most I needed, a lovely watch, in those days. I really wanted to bow. It's beautiful.
Shri Mataji: I told him: "You have to havepearls because it's cooling down." 12:56
All right.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: And this one is for Christine.
[Applause.]
Come along, I'll make you wear. I'm not very good at all these things. I don't know how you do it if there's a double thing here. It's a double one, double latch.
[Applause.]

How did you wear?
Come along, I'll make you wear.
Sahaja Yogi: I like this Shri Mataji, absolutely.
Thank you so much.
Shri Mataji: [Laughter] Wear it now.
Sahaja Yogi: It seems too beautiful.
Shri Mataji: It suits you all right, I have to tell you.
Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: Now, Shri Mataji, Mickael. [In a very low voice]
Shri Mataji: Oh, so beautiful! He looks so nice.
[Laughter. Applause]
That’s the mother’s pleasure.
It has a double latch, you see? So I’m taking out just one and I’ll put on the one and the new one you have to do. I think it’s for the safety. So, it should not fall off it has a double latch.
It’s good, may God bless you.
[Applause.]
May God bless you. Let’s see and have it also.
Oh, you have put on weight I must say.
[Laughter]
Yes, good, good, very good.
May God bless you. So thank you very much.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, thank you.
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you Mother.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you, thank you.
I hope there’s no price in that thing.
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, I’ve checked Mother.
No, I had a look on it.
Shri Mataji: There?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, no,no, no, it was on the others but not on this one, I’ve checked for you.
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you for coming Mother.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all. May God bless you all.
So, here we go.
Somebody is really unhappy, you can see that.
Yes, that’s all. Why didn’t we keep it inside that one in the box? And you want to lock it up also that thing.
Sahaja Yogi: Bolo Shri Jagadamba Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!
Sahaja Yogis: Jai!
Shri Mataji:Guido, let Me know, all right?
Guido: Yes, Shri Mataji; about Diwali? Diwali in Rome?
Shri Mataji:Diwali in Rome.
[Applause]
