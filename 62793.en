(Bhajans till 00:04:35)

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

I’ve already told you yesterday that Truth is what it is. And we do not know it at this human awareness. You have to become a subtler being, and so you have to become the Spirit. The fundamental Truth is that you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego, not these conditionings, but you are Pure Spirit. And that there is an All-pervading subtle Power of divine Love which does all divine work.

Yesterday, I told you how the Kundalini rises through six centres and pierces through our fontanelle bone area, giving us the experience of Actualisation, of baptism. How She nourishes all the centres, enlightens them and ultimately connects you to this All-pervading Power. Today, I want to tell you about the nature of Spirit. The nature of Spirit, – as I told you yesterday –, the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. And the Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, which is the Primordial Mother. And in the Bible, they have not talked about the Mother – much. But the people have created Madonna out of (9:48) [UNCLEAR]christen(?). It is absurd to say that women are second-class citizens. If so, why did people go to this black Madonna to worship her? She is just a painting.

So, this primordial Mother, – which was in Greece called as Athena, in India as Adi Shakti –, is reflected on your Kundalini; we can say that Kundalini is the reflection. Even on the cross, Christ said "Behold the Mother"... on the cross, on that peculiar time. So, this Kundalini is your individual mother, as I told you, and the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. So, the seat of God Almighty is here, on top of the fontanelle bone area; but He is reflected in our heart as Spirit. Because there is one God Almighty, the reflection of that has to be the same. We all should have the same reflection. But the reflectors are different. Supposing there is sun in the sky, it will reflect best in a mirror, less in the water and not at all on the stone. So, Spirit is the collective being within us. In the light of the Spirit, we understand that we are part and parcel of the Whole. This collective being, which is the Spirit, is the one which, when It shines in our attention, when It enlightens our attention, our attention becomes active. A person who is a Realised soul can feel the vibrations of other people because he is a collective being. On his fingertips, he can feel his own centres and the centres of others. Then, this attention, which is through our eyes, is projected, is enlightened by Spirit, and our eyes become innocent. And when this light of the Spirit enters or enlightens our central heart, then we get complete security. It throws its light on our nerves, and we become very powerful. For example, when Christ faced Mary Magdalene, he had nothing to do with the prostitutes. But look at His courage when He faced the people and said "Those who have not committed any sin can throw stones at Me". This courage we develop when we know the Truth that we are the Spirit. Such a man is not afraid of anything. He says things openly without any fear. When you see something clearly, when you see there are flowers, you say "these are flowers", because you are no more blind to Truth. So this attention which is enlightened can act, can create beautiful peace and joy in another personality. It gives you wisdom to understand what is good and what is bad for you. In that light, you understand what is real and what is unreal.

Realisation is not possible for frivolous people or for people who do not care for themselves and [UNCLEAR – 00:19:19] powers. Because it’s a very powerful force within you, which is the Spirit. It is going to manifest His powers through you. You can give Realisation to others, you can cure people, you are not afraid of anything, and you are filled with compassion and Love. We had a Sahaja yogini from England who was staying in Dehra Dun, and she heard of a young architect who was down with blood cancer. And she telephoned to Me: "Mother, should I go and cure him?”. I said: "By all means, why not?”. And she cured him without getting any after-effects upon herself. And this architect was certified to be dead after one month by the doctors. Seven years have passed, he’s still very well, he’s doing well. So, this Spirit becomes a curative power within you; it cures you and it cures others. With this attention, you know the absolute Truth.

Once I was told that from India there was one gentleman, who was released from the jail, who came to Berlin and sat in one of these cross-rooms somewhere with orange clothes. And he became a very big guru; and then he became very rich. Now how can you make out if somebody is false or real? How will you recognize Christ if He appears before you?

If you have ten children who are realised, and if you tie a piece of cloth on their eyes, and put someone before them and ask them “What’s wrong with this gentleman?”, then they put up only one finger like this (Shri Mataji shows Her right forefinger). So, you ask the gentleman: "Have you got something wrong with your throat”. He says "How do you know?”. Because this finger knows this centre (Shri Mataji places Her forefinger on the Vishuddhi chakra). And all of them will say the same thing. So, on vibrations, you will know what is the Truth and what is not the Truth.

For example, if there are some mad people seated. And they start shaking before Me. Also there could be some egoists seated, who might also shake equally the same as the mad ones. But one would shake on the right hand and the other would shake on the left hand. So you know that these are the egoists and these are the mad. Not only about human beings but about anything, whatever is the Absolute Truth, you know. So there is no quarrel, there is no fight, there is no argument. On the contrary, you enjoy each other’s spiritual life. It’s a very enjoyable life together in the collective. But the Spirit gives that light within us by which we develop the peaceful existence. And this peaceful existence comes to us with a feeling of peace within us, not by talking of peace but just a feeling within us. For example, now there are beautiful flowers there. Normally, if you look at it, you will think "from where it has come, so beautiful, and from where to buy” and all those things, thoughts will start to come. Like this carpet is so beautiful and I look at it, but anybody would be worried who owns it, even worse than that... stole it. But I look at it, just look, I don’t react; as a witness. And the joy that the artist has put in this carpet starts flowing on my being like beautiful stream of peace.

And our attention thus becomes extremely steady. Any people these days develop something called tension; all the time they say there is a tension. It’s a common disease. It comes either by too much conditioning or by ego. But supposing both these balloons (Shri Mataji put up her hands on both sides of the head) are removed, then there cannot be any tension at all. Because we think that we have done something, this tension builds in us. But what do we do? Now say a tree was dead, so out of a tree we made this table, thinking we have done something very great. From dead to dead; we have done no divine work. This ego comes to us: we have done this, we have done that. We cannot even produce a small little molecule. Even on the flowers.

So now after Realisation, you start doing living work. You can give Realisation to human beings and completely transform them. But the greatest achievement is that you jump into the ocean of Joy. There is no jealousy, hatred, anything of that kind. You just become joyous. Joy is not duality. Not like this is happiness and unhappiness. Joy cannot be described, it’s to be experienced. There are so many things that happen to a Sahaja yogi that in this short lecture, I may not be able to tell you. This knowledge is limitless. Only in English language, I must have given 4,000 lectures. But it is like this that when you come in this room, there are lights, and you have to just switch on one switch. I don’t have to tell you about the history of electricity, how it came to Berlin and how it was brought in this hall. You’d be bored stiff. It is all built-in. In the same way, it is built-in in you also, the whole thing. The only thing is to enlighten. Once the switch is on or when you are connected with the mains, it starts working. So it is better to get your enlightenment first, and then you can listen to all my tapes. By reading too much also we get confused. By reading anything, you cannot achieve the Truth. But only by experience you can achieve the Truth.

(Shri Mataji addresses somebody in the audience): Please put down your hand... What’s the matter with you? All right.

Only through experience, you can know the Truth. And you have to certify yourself. No one can certify you, except for yourself. This is the Last Judgement; this is how the Resurrection is working out everywhere.

I am sorry that I come in Berlin very late, because we have no centre in Berlin. But now I feel very confident that it will work out because I found you people extremely honest. Again today, if you have to ask me questions, just ask a few because yesterday we wasted too much of time. I want to guide all of you and attend to you individually.

(Addressing someone in the audience): Were you here yesterday?

What is it? What do you want to ask?

[INAUDIBLE QUESTION] What did he say?

A yogini: He wants to know if you are aware that we are in a Freemason [UNCLEAR] temple.

Shri Mataji: Of course. So what? [INAUDIBLE] I know that also; then what?

[INAUDIBLE] Why have you come here to quarrel with Me? What have I done wrong to you?

[INAUDIBLE] That does not belong now to Freemasons – this hall. All right. This does not belong anymore to Freemasons. It is owned by some private company now. Do you understand it?

[INAUDIBLE] Of course, there is. [INAUDIBLE] What do you want to say? I don’t understand. You have paid for it? You have not paid for it, you can go. I don’t want you disturb anyone. If you are a Freemason, I know what Freemasons are doing; I don’t want to talk about them. [INAUDIBLE] But why do you want to talk about these things? Are you not interested in your Spirit? Why do you want to waste everybody’s time like that? You seem to be a sensible man. Then? All right, keep quiet. What is it now?

[INAUDIBLE] What is she saying? [INAUDIBLE] You come first time today, is it Madam? [INAUDIBLE] No, listen to Me; it is an experience, it is not understood mentally. All right. First, you have the experience, and then you’ll understand it better. I know it is quite subtle, because we live in gross life.

A yogini: She says that she read the leaflet.

Shri Mataji: But still you have not understood. It doesn’t matter. I’ll make you understand. Have patience with yourself.

[INAUDIBLE] Let it be, it’s all right, it doesn’t matter. It’s all right. I’ll manage it. All right.

[INAUDIBLE QUESTION] What do you say? You see, he reads some book and come and tell Me. You see, that’s not the way. Try to understand what I am saying... whatever you have read, you have achieved nothing out of it. So, why do you want to come and tell Me something that you have read? You just try, you have patience and get your Realisation. All right? Because supposing you think that you read some book, then you come and mention some work to Me; that’s not the way. I am here to give you the key of your Realisation. All right? There’s no examination, there’s no examination going on with you, is it? If you have not understood, it doesn’t matter. You will understand. But you read some book, XYZ, then you go to some guru, you go there, and then you come and ask Me a question. That’s not the way. The way is to ask relevant questions. If you really want to have your Realisation, then ask relevant questions. All right?

Now, what are these seven chakras are? There are seven chakras, no doubt. And the Kundalini rises and pierces through this fontanelle bone area where is the seat of God Almighty, which is reflected in our heart. All right? That’s all. Now you see if it happens to you or not.

Yesterday, there were very nice questions, I must say. Because, you see, you have read so many books, I know, you have. But did they give you the answer; did they give you the experience? You are here to take the experience.

[INAUDIBLE QUESTION] Why do you have to ask this too? Because you don’t know anything, you see, you are so ignorant. [INAUDIBLE] All right, now you go then. According to us, you don’t know... Everybody who wants it should go out, finished. Would you please go out. You see, that door is open to anyone, mad people can also come in, it doesn’t matter, but now it’s all right; you’d better go now on. No, no, please leave this hall, we don’t want you here, finished, you’d better go; useless, you have to go, useless, I’m sorry.

(Applause)

(The man is shouting)

Just imagine, what matters with the people... I mean; you see, they must have some sense in the heads. What did he say?

(A yogi explains the situation in German)

You see, problem is like this: you see, there are many people who are in the market. They are making money out of their preaching. They are many. And because I say you cannot make money, they’re all against Me. They are feeling challenged, and that’s why they send some people like this. But Truth has to be [UNCLEAR] things that really challenge Falsehood, what can you do? Nowadays, I would say, it’s not so much; it’s used to be much more. Because there are so many false gurus in this world. And so many false things going on. And when you talk of the Truth, naturally they do not like it because they are earning money out of you. It’s a big business. This is the reason why there is an opposition like this. But openly they will never oppose. They send some mad man like this to talk, that’s all. But I must tell you that in some countries, they are very sensitive. Like... I must tell you about Russia; in Russia, anywhere I go, we have to book a stadium, fully. Fourteen to sixteen thousands people come; and very well-educated and scientists of high level, very good seekers. And they achieve also great heights. I’ve never faced anything like this in anyone of these countries. But you know that we have here people who are... this is the beginning of Sahaja yoga, so naturally one has to face this, not to feel bad of it. So this is nothing new to Me. All right, it doesn’t matter. So now, I think we should not allow you to ask questions, because that seems a waste of time; it is better that you get your Realisation first, then you will not ask many questions. And yesterday also I told you that these are mental acrobatics. What is the use of being this mental acrobat? I’m quite good at answering but this is just a waste of time.

So now, we’d better step to our Realisation first. But you must have an open mind of a scientist. That is you should take it as a hypothesis to begin with. And, if it is Truth, then you have to accept it as honest beings. Because it is not only for your emancipation but the emancipation of the whole world.

There are three conditions as I told you [CUT IN THE VIDEO]:

Nobody should feel guilty; forget the past. Yesterday, there was a lady who was saying: "Mother, I cannot get over my guilt.” Don’t you know it is just a mental projection? I also told you that if you feel guilty this centre catches really badly; here, on the left side (Shri Mataji puts Her right hand on the left Vishuddhi) and you get angina, you get also spondylitis, so many diseases you get with this catch.

(Aside: So, there are two open windows, that’s why. I don’t know why. [UNCLEAR] All right.)

So, that second condition is not to feel guilty at all. You are human beings, you are not God. If you are done mistakes, so what does it matter? Because this Divine Power is the power of Forgiveness; and whatever mistake you might commit, It can dissolve all the mistakes. (Aside: This gentleman has closed it; there was one gentleman who came and closed it). All right.

Then we have the third condition, which may look difficult but it is the easiest thing to do. The condition is that you have to forgive everyone, even forgive this gentleman; because whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself unnecessarily. So, it is important, very important, that you have to forgive everyone without thinking about any individual, in general.

As I told you yesterday, this Agnya chakra, the one which is on the optic chiasma, is like this closed, absolutely closed chakra. And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open. If you forgive, it opens like this (Shri Mataji shows how the chakra opens with Her forefingers and middle fingers). And makes the Kundalini to pass through. These are the only three conditions.

There are two sides, left and right. The left side energy is the power of desire; and the right side is the power of action. Please put both the feet apart from each other. So that the left side is away from the right side; and take out your shoes. (Aside: In the beginning, it happens everywhere, [UNCLEAR]). And those who are sitting on the ground are all right, they don’t have to worry. All right.

Now, please put your left hand on your lap. This is symbolic that you desire to have your Self-Realisation. Put your right hand now on your heart because in the heart resides the Spirit. Sitting comfortably, sahaj asana, it is to open out your... open out, not to lock it out. Now, if you are the Spirit, you become your own master, because in the light of Spirit, you know Reality. So you put your right hand on the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. Then you take your hand on the low portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the centre of Pure Knowledge. Now, again you take your hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen; we are showing you now, you can have a look here properly, then you’ll have to close your eyes. Then, now you raise your hand again on your heart. Now, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. This centre, I’ve already told you, catches when you all feel guilty. Now you take your right hand onto your forehead across and bend your head. This is the centre where you have to forgive everyone, in general. Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Now, please stretch your palm and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which is the soft bone in your childhood. Please bend your head as far as possible. Now, push back your fingers, this is important. And now with a great pressure you move your scalp seven times, slowly, clockwise.

Now, that’s all we have to do.

If you have anything tight on your waist or on your neck, please remove the attach. Also, you can remove your glasses because you have to close your eyes; and please do not open your eyes till I tell you. Please put your left hand towards Me, your right hand on the heart. Put the feet apart. And now close your eyes. Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please ask Me three times: Mother, am I the Spirit?

If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So, please take your right hand on the (low portion of your abdomen) upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side; you are only working on the left-hand side. And ask Me a question three times: Mother, am I the Spirit (my own master)? I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom and you can only get It in the glory of your freedom. I cannot force Pure Knowledge on you. So, you have to now take your right hand in the low portion of your abdomen. Here you have to ask six times, because this centre has got six petals: Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge. I cannot force on you. As soon as you start asking for Pure Knowledge, Kundalini starts rising, so we have to nourish the upper centres with our full self-confidence. So now please raise your right hand on upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and with full confidence you have to say ten times: Mother, I am my own master.

I’ve already told you the fundamental Truth about this that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, nor this mind, this ego or these conditionings; but you are the Pure Spirit. So now raise right hand onto your heart and say with full confidence, 12 times: Mother, I am the Spirit.

I’ve already told you that this Divine Power is the Ocean of Love and Compassion. It is the Ocean of Absolute Knowledge, but above all, it is the Ocean of Forgiveness; so, whatever mistake you might commit can be easily dissolved by the power of the Ocean of Forgiveness.

So now, will you please raise your hand onto the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and put your head to your right. Here, you have to say 16 times with full confidence: Mother, I am not guilty at all.

I’ve told you whether you forgive or not forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands, and you torture yourself. So now, raise your hand to your forehead across, and put down your head. Here you have to say, not how many times but from your heart: Mother, I forgive everyone.

Now, take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, you have to say for your satisfaction: Ô Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistake.

Now, stretch your palm and put the centre of your palm onto the fontanelle bone area. Here you press it hard and put down your head, push back your fingers. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. So, move your scalp asking for Self-Realisation seven times: Mother, give me my Self-Realisation. Because I cannot force on you. Push back your fingers to put a pressure, push back. Don’t fold your hand, push back. Push it hard and now move seven times, saying: Mother, please give me my Self-Realisation. (Shri Mataji is blowing in the microphone seven times).

Now please, remove your hands. Put your hands like this; open your eyes. Now watch Me without thinking. Please put your right hand towards Me like this, and put down your head and see with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Please put down your head. Now, please put your left hand towards Me and see with your right hand. Don’t put the hand on top of your head, but away from it, and move it and see. Now, put again right hand towards Me; bend your head and see for yourself. If you are getting hot breeze, it means that you are still not forgiving.

Now, raise both the hands, towards the sky like this, push back your head. Ask any of these three questions three times: Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the divine Love? Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya? Ask any of these questions three times. Now take down your hands. Put your hands towards Me.

All those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands, or on their fingers or out of the fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands. May God bless you! Most of you have felt It. Some of you felt It yesterday and today didn’t feel It; you are thinking about it. Don’t think; I’ll work it out. All right. But in any way, I would like to meet you all before you go. But don’t ask Me too many questions. If you have any problem, I’ll try to correct it.

From 1:19:00, Shri Mataji works on seekers and Yogis individually.
