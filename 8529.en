1985-12-25 India Tour 1985/86: First Night in Brahmapuri

[Recording of choir performance on December 25].

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Beautiful. (Applause).

[Mother is conversing with Sahaja Yogis in Marathi and Hindi. Sahaja Yogis are inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Yes? Not that. I have not got any money. Is that so? Tell them we will get it to their home. Is he their brother? Whose? It is so, that nothing has been agreed about the money yet. Tell him we will come to their house and give it. How much?

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible/Fifty thousand].

Shri Mataji: Fifty? That is too much.

[Other Sahaja Yogis have arrived].

Shri Mataji: Where is Nima? Come on, let everyone come. Call the wife, the mother, it has to be given to them. Sit, sit, but the dance (program) is over.

(To the dance performer): Come, nice, excellent. Very nicely performed. Keep growing in the future. Concentration is good. You are also good. Whom did you learn from?

Now, please accept these “phoole tar phoolachi pakli” (Marathi saying, “petals in lieu of a flower”, meaning a small token of appreciation). Such a beautiful program.

Infinite Blessings to you. (Applause).

(Addressing all in Marathi and English): After this, should we have music program? Have you got your harmonium here or not? Then place a harmonium and tabla. Send them.

So now, you people have to organise, I will be sitting here comfortably. You have to be on the stage. Country-wise, should we start it?

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: All right. The stage is small though. You need the harmonium here? Keep it then. Oh God, all of them cannot. They cannot go on the stage. Some can go on the stage, some can be here.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Nice sari. Beautiful sari you wore. Nice sari. Good.

You are all in the choir, aren’t you? International choir can partly go up, and partly can sit down.

Yes, yes, yes. Half of you could be there. The ladies could be up there. Let us do that.

Quite a big international choir is, I think.

Patricia, you are also singing. Good idea. I did not know you were a musician.

Come and sit down, as many as you can. Some can go from this side. They look very nice in their sari. Don’t you?

Warren?

(To other Sahaja Yogis): Come here, come here. Come and sit here. Where is Nima?

(To a Sahaja Yogi): Come here. I was waiting for you to arrive for a long time, gave bandhans and then you came.

(To a Sahaja Yogi): You have an extraordinary daughter. Nice. She is an artist. She has such a wonderful knowledge of art. There must be something special about both of them. They are very nice children.

(To a Sahaja Yogi): What did you say? [Inaudible].

[The choir starts performing Christmas carols. The first song is “Gloria, in Excelsis Deo”.]

[The next performance is “Away In A Manger”. Mother also sings along].

Shri Mataji (in English and Marathi): Good. My throat is sore, me, just, I am singing.

Sahaja Yogis: [Inaudible].

Shri Mataji: I think all of them are. [Inaudible].

[The next performance is “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen”. Mother also sings along].

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): It has been many years now.

[The next performance is “O Come Let Us Adore Him”. Mother also sings along].

[Applause].

Shri Mataji (to a Sahaja Yogi): No, no, I cannot manage it. My voice has gone, it is not working. It has been many years. My voice does not work. The Vishuddhi is caught (laughs).

[The next performance is “Silent Night”. Mother also sings along].

Sahaja Yogi: One more, Mother. [Inaudible].

Shri Mataji (to a Sahaja Yogi in Marathi): How can I sing my own praises? There is no objection in singing about Christ.

[The next performance is “Alleluia!” (lyrics in English Songbook)].

[Applause].

[Inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: Brian from New Zealand wrote the song. He managed to catch the words of the song. It was written by Brian Bell from New Zealand. He adapted them to the tune of hymn which you probably know.

[Applause].

Shri Mataji: Well done. Very well done. Very good. Excellent. Well done. Well done.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible/The Americans].

Shri Mataji: All the American Sahaja Yogis. American Sahaja Yogis, please. [Applause].

[Mother is guiding the Sahaja Yogis on the seating].

To a Sahaja Yogi: You better sit in. That is the stage. Good.

Better go that side. It is rather steep. Little bit move on this side. Some of you can come on this side also.

Sahaja Yogi: They all have one copy Mother. They all have to look at one sheet. (Laughter).

Shri Mataji: That is wrong (laughs).

Sahaja Yogi: It is truly Sahaja.

Shri Mataji: We are going to have a Xerox now presented to you. Xerox machine from America. It is amazing, isn’t it, Americans are having that problem.

That is Vishuddhi problem (laughs).

[The choir has resumed singing. Mother asks to place the mike nearer to them].

[Choir performs “From Where I Stand In The Sunrise”].

[Inaudible conversation between Sahaja Yogis and Mother].

Shri Mataji: Yes, to begin with, we will give a little impetus. Everyone can sing. We will give a little bit impetus. Only, one that you can sing without any paper. (Laughter). Indians have not heard these songs. So, they will be very happy. The Pune people. He sang it in Nasik.

Rather serious all of you. Bit too serious. Find all you of are very serious.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]. This song is written by Doug.

[A solo singer performs the song].

“He had always been a seeker of Truth,

Believing he would find a way,

The path was there he knew it was,

But which he just couldn’t say.

He felt that he had reached the end,

And sadly sat down in despair,

And then he gazed upon a new light,

The answer he sought was there.

La, da, dah, da, dah, dah, da, da, dum.

La, da, dah, da, dah, dah, da, da, dum.

La, da, dah, da, dah, dah, da dum.

He entered the room and took a near seat,

And silently said a prayer,

And behold upon a stage,

A woman was suddenly there.

He felt such love fill the room,

And peace came and settled in him,

It’s strange when man can’t find God,

God seems to come to him.

La, da, dah, da, dah, dah, da, da, dum.

La, da, dah, da, dah, dah, da, da, dum.

La, da, dah, da, dah, dah, da dum.”
