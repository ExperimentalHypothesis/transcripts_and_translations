Hello, are you all happy?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, thank you.

Shri Mataji: Hello, I’ll give you money in Pila?
Jeanine: Yes, thank you

[Conversation in Hindi about 90 seconds]

Hello, how are you?

Shri Mataji: Why do you go to the [unclear]? Next time you are not going. It’s very dangerous, you know? [Unclear] In India, we never go in the bush nor in the sun.
Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Now don’t go.

Shri Mataji: Where does he come from?
Gregoire: He comes from Cameroon, Shri Mataji. And he wants to register an association of Sahaja Yoga in Cameroon.
Sahaja Yogi: It's done; it’s done.
Gregoire: With you. It has already been done.
Shri Mataji: That’s very nice.
Gregoire: There are about 60 Sahaja Yogis, sixty people who are meditating; 6-0.
Shri Mataji: Congratulations.
Gregoire: He wants to write a book on Sahaja Yoga and Christianity. He would like to have your inspiration.
Shri Mataji: What language?
Gregoire: In French.
He wonders whether you can help him find a wife.
Shri Mataji: Of course.
[Laughter]
Very good.
I want to take more of [unclear]. Thanks

Gregoire: Can we go a little bit faster, please? Because ...
Another time.
She’d like to give you a kiss, but I said, "Another time".
[Shri Mataji is chuckling]

Shri Mataji: How are you now, all right?
Sahaja Yogini: I’m feeling all right.
Shri Mataji: You have a liver problem. You come to the centre then correct it.

Gregoire: She lives in Switzerland but she comes from Russia. She has come to Switzerland.
Shri Mataji: From Moscow?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: When did you come?
Gregoire: When did you come?
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear]

Gregoire: Please could you just give the flowers to Shri Mataji, without kneeling and prostrating, so it will be a little bit faster.

[Shri Mataji leaves.]
