Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Gavin Brown's apartment (building demolished), London (England)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

So, today, I called this meeting because, which is a big announcement of Gregoire getting married. And he’s been very sweet to his bride. I liked it. He was very gentle and nice and really took it in the proper sense. And Rajesh also came with his ‘fiance’. He is getting married on the 12th. And then another thing is about how to develop England and Europe together.
In England, a very substantial force is there, no doubt. But we have to think about how to propagate. Now I have thought of one or two things which are lacking in Sahaja Yoga in here, I think. One of them is we have no publicity done. We have not been able to get people for publicity. Now this Times fellow; before I leave, we have to do something about it. You can take it and note it down, it would be better. Note it.
[Sahaja Yogis talking]

[Unclear] it is better be written down some points, will be better. Behind Me, paper and pencil, you take it.
[Sahaja Yogis talking]
So what is that to tape in here? It’s better to write it down, in short.

Agnya? All right. Everybody is catching Left Agnya.
Look at her, with the hands she is trying to... I mean cover her feet or if you have socks, it’s better. It is getting blue with that. Hmm...it’s cold.

So, first this gentleman, what was his name, was ‘Mascareness’ or whatever it was, to be contacted. And there is a doctor in Geneva who has taken lot of interest. His name is Dr. Masca. In his presence, I cured about 5 people. So, he said that he didn’t deliberate in My presence. I said, "All right ". And he is going to study those things. So, you tell Gregoire to get after him that he goes and sees these people. And they should try to convince the people whom I’ve cured, that by giving something in writing, they will be helping other people to get cured of Sahaja Yoga. You see, this is the only way we can really approach these gross people.

So, he is going to give an article starting with this, that he saw this miracle. Then he saw the raising of the Kundalini. He saw the - I mean the kind of an article you would like to publish. You should give him a little lead to Gregoire, on these lines. You have to prepare on what lines we are going to publish the thing. We have, of course, concrete examples you can give, he being a doctor, you see. It will have an effect and that we should publish it in England, because he was also practicing here. He has a house in this merrily ground road or somewhere. So, we can publish in his name. So one of the advantages would be, that he being a sort of an authorized person, you can publish this article about Sahaja Yoga in his name. And we can contact Mr. Mascar. Then, in case we are successful, we can have a press conference or something, before I leave, if possible. Or when I come back, one of them and we have to work it out in such a way, that we also have a press conference, later on.

For publicity, you see, what we have found that this poster business works out wonders. So, when I come back, we have to think on those lines of posters. And we can get very good posters done in India, if you want, and can get them by the ship. But if they arrive after four years, don’t blame Me.
[Laughter]
Find out all the methods by which you can publish. Now, Gregoire’s book, we can take to some publisher and ask him if he would like to publish. Then what about Don’s book? That has to be ready before I leave, so we’ll get it published in India.
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

Yes, so what’s happening now? The little dolly baby? She knows her Mother. She knows her Mother very well.

So, when we have, I mean we should all sit down and find out how we can publish about or sort of advertise about Sahaja Yoga. You see today even ordinary thing like punk crop or something you know that goes into the eyes of these people, because they create a controversy. Now, you can start a lecture CDs on the false gurus. You people can go ahead with it. You can go on talking about this false guru is like this, that false guru is like this and nowadays another thing they started is magnetism. They put a magnetism and with the photograph of the guru. And they turn the magnet in a different way, you see, and then the bhoot comes in. I mean so many ways they will use, I don't know this is one of the latest I have seen. So, you see all this.

Then there is another thing is that they get the photographs of the terrestrial or some sort of a beings you see out of reach, more surprising! The God, Who is on this earth are My eyes, and [as if?] (beautiful?) the photograph is taken from here so the nose is like that and there is a mike in front. I don't know from where they got this idea. The lady showed Me, so I said you better write to them. They can find out, I mean look at, what point they are! This is so subtle. And also for this I could say that [Peter?] she has to go around. So I will first give you the way it should be done is you write to Marie. She wants to [UNCLEAR] to go there, Marie. In Switzerland, everybody wants to know about [TM?]. And they said they can arrange lectures for you. But there is one doctor in Germany, who is very anxious to meet you. He is the head, sort of a head in [Trigo?] or someplace. Yes. This doctor, his name I forgot. And he says, 'No, no there are 20 names and this and that' - but I told you. But he has got his Realization surprisingly despite the head of a nonsense. I tell you he is so gracious, Sahaja Yoga is so [NOT CLEAR]. Such a man like that, who has been in Sahaja Yoga for years. Ten years or so, is the head of that thing there, he got Realization all right.

[Sahaja Yogi talking]

[NOT CLEAR] (forgetting?) But they will all write to... Gregoire is going to write to you. Thomas. Thomas was so sweet. His wife was, wife means his friend was quite opposing Sahaja Yoga, and, but still he organized on his own and very, very sweet he was and I mean he didn't have much money but still we arranged all that, but the rest of it was so sweet he did. And, very sensible. He is a very good man. And another was, another was Jack, you remember Jack? The one who came with his wife, who would not give her name.
But this girl from Sydney did not meet Me.

(Sahaja Yogi talking).

Huh? Oh! That's it! Carrie.

Sahaja Yogi: Another Carrie".

Shri Mataji: Yeah. Australia is doing very well. Everyday I get a letter from there saying that, "I've got Realization, I've got Realization," and it's a very good way because you see they are writing about what is happening to this. So we have in writing, everything.

Now, this is very important is to go down there. And, one day I'll sit down with you and tell you what are the points to be covered with these people. They can't believe it! They can't believe it! They are so brain-washed, they can't just believe it. And they said, you see all the head is divided into sixteen parts, I tell you. Horrible Agnya and they don't want to believe it! They said, "No it is doing good to us, it has done good to so many people," and this and that. I really, I can't imagine! But I said there is somebody like this will come and talk to you. They have taken your name, but I wish I had not given the name, because then they will ring up the main head and there they might tell them that some (brain wave?). But in any case you must go and see this man. And then we got two other TM people there, who came to the program, of whom Thomas was rather worried, because he was also in TM. But when these two people came in, they told Me that he is a devil incarnate. I said all right. So, there it started working out. You see then, Thomas got back his confidence also. So, the whole thing turned out very well. I think so, there was something.

[Sahaja yogi talking: blue suits and red tie and...]

[NOT CLEAR] Blue suit was not there, but something he was little elegantly dressed I should say, quite nicely dressed. But not exactly blue suits, but elegantly dressed people. May be they might be Initiator for [NOT CLEAR] but they said that he was the incarnation of devil. They had no doubts. So, this is what, so now you have to work it out.

Now Spain people, out of only their phone numbers, I will get their addresses. And Portugal. All these things are to be looked after. Portugal, Spain, France, Nice. Nice, we've got a very good center in Nice. But now, I think Marie is looking after, Marie has been really spending lot of money, she did a lot. She did a lot, I must say. And, she is going to look after Nice. But still you should find out about it, what's happening.

So, we've got Portugal, then we've got Spain, Madrid, then we've got Nice. And the addresses of all these people should be brought in. Today I'll give you the addresses of California people. Addresses of California is coming. So, Pradhan may be coming here. Then what else? Then we've got Paris, Lille. Write it down all these places: Lille, Paris. Then, I went to Geneva, then Lausanne, then where did I go next to that? Zurich, Bern. Bern, Bern, Zurich and then Basel. Basel. And then to this Freiburg. Freiburg, where our Rustom has done some job. How are you? How is Mr.(?) I don't see him at all.

[Sahaja Yogi talking]

He is all right now? Upset? So then, what did I say? Then Bonn, Freiburg, then Bonn. But you have to immediately write to Thomas, find out from him what is he doing about it. He wants somebody to go to Bonn, Freiburg. So we have to arrange all these things, you see. There is one lady who is going to Nigeria form there. She might work out it. So, get the list of people. All the list of these
people and their addresses. Portugal, I don't know if you have written to them, Portugal people. What have you?

[Sahaja Yogini talking]

But you wrote?

[Sahaja Yogini talking]

They sent a letter to this girl. They have sent her a letter. So better, write to her also so that form a complete circuit with them. So, this is the she is unhappy about something is to be put on the other side I think . She is on one side she has been too much. Little move her to this side. So, now for England. Our great poet Blake has already... Did you read that Blake's thing? Wonderful! Just imagine! What a prophecy! What a prophecy! So correct - and foundation so laid.

See actually, he is seeing, just imagine how great they are in the laws of divine! You see that he prophesized, but for other people, you people don't understand the value of all these things that you're doing. And we should see the profoundness of the whole thing - how profound it is, how we are handling the whole situation ourselves, I mean you are not understanding and realizing how deep it is and what it means. We are taking it still in a stride I think. Imagine him to write all these things and all the prophecies he has made, now at least that will give I think some boost to London Sahaja Yogis. How? That they will realize their importance and that what important, I mean Jerusalem means the pilgrimages. That means Jerusalem is now going to shift from there to here. So what a great thing! Great prophet. He was a prophet. You see, I picked him out. Gavin, you remember? I went to see all his works. I mean, I picked him out. I didn't know all this that he has done it. I didn't know about this poem also this Jerusalem one. And I think Warren has given Me one book but I read a little bit here and there not much. But I'm now going to read all that. Look at him. What a poet you had. Prophet, a real prophet he was. What a prophecy! He might be [NOT CLEAR]. So precise. So precise, imagine! And beautifully described! Really beautifully described. This is, who has done this? Jeremy has found out, is it?

Sahaja yogi talking: Jeremy and then .[NOT CLEAR] and then Jeremy found this thing.

Shri Mataji: One has to go into his works to find out what he has prophesized more.

Sahaja Yogi: He got the whole, complete and also he got the complete work...

Shri Mataji: Great! Jerusalem. All right. So now for Jerusalem, what is to be done? That we have to find out. That is to be little bit worked out in various methods, you see?

Gregoire has certain ideas. He said that we should materially improve ourselves first of all. Little bit. For presentation it's important he said that. Gregoire, you see, he is very practical. He said, the presentation should be, if not blue suits at least there should be some proper English suits, that should be worn because an Englishman like a hippy won't be accepted anywhere. An Englishman to be dressed up properly is important. So, that is something you find out what thing proper is. But need not be absolutely one-color stuff but everybody should try to. For presentation, when you go to a, say, a meeting or something, it should appear that it belonged to old, old style English traditional person.

See, so people take you seriously, which was Gregoire's very good idea because for all these functions, he told all the people in Switzerland that they must dressup properly. And then how to behave in a program and all that, he is very particular you see? For a newcomer, as he said to Me that for a newcomer, what matters is your outside. They don't know about your inside and how you behave and all that. He said that, "Mother you make a little outline for that and discuss with all the London people also." How to work out the outside behavior of Sahaja Yogis when they go to a meeting or hold a meeting or work it out in a way. Because it should look like one group and working out together. One group is the main point is, you see? And everybody should support each other in the presence of others. See otherwise it looks as if some blind people are trying to lead other blind. It should appear that you people have achieved something and that you are all in one tune with each other or there is no quarrel between you and there is no indignity.

Because if others, when they see you in this manner, they get frightened and they run away. So, he said that for that I have to make some outline, but I would like to have suggestions from you people and also on top of that, I hope you'll make it ready by this week. All of you to give Me suggestions as to what sort of things we should have, which will look presentable to people. Like you see, they expect something of an Englishman and if that is not there, then they tell, "These are some of the craps," you see. So, Gregoire's idea was correct that they should appear in this way and I think you should think over it. What should be done for.

And secondly, we have to find out, see the places where I visited and try to allocate places to every Sahaja yogi, who would like to look at those places. Now what happens to people who come and go away? What is the reason? You should find out. Go and talk to them. You must make a study of that. Why do they come to Sahaja Yoga and then disappear? One of the reasons, as these people discussed was this, that, people are very naive. They don't know what to expect. So, Don's book is also after realization, you see? There should be a small introduction of Sahaja Yoga according to them a small little introduction to Sahaja Yoga, what to expect, what to find. I think, one of My speeches is there which I gave you. We can sit down and chart out an introduction to Sahaja Yoga. What are we to expect, you see? And a very direct thing should be there.

And, I mean for advertising, say for example you want to have a meeting somewhere, you can even have pamphlets, you can even distribute and things that people can come and intensively we should work out in every place. Then it will grow faster. Pune is doing very good work, Pune. Tremendous. Apart from that, Bombay is doing very well. Rajesh was saying it is going very well in Maharashtra. But the only difference between Maharashtra and other places is this: that they know about it beforehand. They know Kundalini, they know what to expect, you see. This is what is missing. So if you can give it in writing, what to expect out of Self Realization, and very directly - the points. First what to expect, what is Self Realization? What is Self? Very, very directly, you see, absolutely. So, that anybody who wants to read can see that. And then he should see that what to expect and all. If we can prepare something like that, then you prepare a sort of a, what you call a framework and then we can fill it up.

But should not be complicated, simple and very direct. Because even Don's book is after Realization. Before Realization, that book is bit too much. We can do it in small, very small way. There is no need to question and answer sort of thing we can do it very direct. Now, after Realization, people go away, you see. Now for that also we have to understand why. Why people go and what should we do to stop them? Some of them whom I talked to, you see, why they went away is that some say there is no love between Sahaja Yogis. This is a very important point. They do not talk to each other with love. You see this is the fellow from Rajneesh, he was, and he said in Rajneesh there is lot of love. Well, you see it is filth, you know there, but doesn't matter. To him outsider he sees everybody, you see, very friendly and nice and this and that. So, the kind of dryness and arrogance or we can say fighting and all that nonsense should be avoided.

So, all this we have to chart it out, but this is one of the reasons. Secondly, they said that some of the Sahaja Yogis talk in such a manner as if they are great, you see. They have achieved a lot and very egoistically they talk. And that repels people. They should talk in a softer way. That might be hinting at Gregoire, maybe, I don't know. But I must say Gregoire's shouting helps other way around. I mean many people become very alert. But his style is different you know. So everybody should not take to the same style. You can have different styles of approaching people. It's like Gavin and Gregoire both go hand-in-hand very well. I mean if they both of them approach somebody, then the left and right both are put together. Such combinations should be found out. You see where, the great thing is the friendship of Sahaja Yogis, you see. The great friendship must be developed.
That friendship I don't know, should be like, Ram said that Pradhan is coming everybody felt very happy, you see. Why? After all Pradhan is such an old man, 75-year old man coming here. But you feel so close to him, why? Because you are born of the same Mother and you are doing such a tremendous work and all these fellow feelings should come like a soldier fights with [INAUDIBLE] others are also fighting the same way. But that is not there. You see it is more artificial. Sort of... I think that is what is... huh?

Sahaja Yogi : Everyone's attention is on very petty things all the time.

Shri Mataji : I think so.

Sahaja Yogi : There is not sort of enthusiasm and fire. Sort of, you know, energy [NOT CLEAR] It's all whose turn is it to do this
and I mean.

Shri Mataji: That, that should be stopped completely. That's what I was saying. Why not get a maid servant for the Ashram? Better get a maid and pay herthan to worry about it. This is something that will pull you down so much. I tell you so much. Hopeless.

Sahaja Yogi: Also I think there is a tendency to become a kind of hypochondriac, Mother. People become obsessed with their catches, you know, and they sit there and just worrying about what catch they have got and all this, and they won't do anything
for Sahaja yoga, you know. They just worry about themselves all the time.

Shri Mataji: See? Now, for this I've told Harry that you should not worry - now leave your hand, just sit, still I will look after it. You should not worry about your catches at all. The more you worry, the more the, they will be there. Now for example, you are very subtle. Gavin knows this point very well. As you were subtler and they were subtler also. Very clever. They would like to come in the program to disturb Me. I'll give one of the examples. That in the program, they'll come just to give a feeling that you're unwell. You start behaving like that. So the other people, who are there they say, see they are unwell why should we be here? Then they start clearing yourself out like that. See all these things go against good publicity. Then their attention is on your, 'I'm catching here I'm catching there'. The more you do that, the more they will be there. It's all not catching anywhere. They will run away. See, they are there just to create a problem for Me and for Sahaja Yoga.

So, better tell your mind that, "You get out from here. We don't want any help. Had enough of you." If you do that it will work out. Or you should, best thing is to say, 'Surrender'. Surrender is the only way. Anything comes, "I'll surrender myself to Mother, finished. All these things will go away. That's the best way. Then you start seeing [?] very clearly, which I've been talking to Harry. That he would used to worry like, "Where should I put my attention?" I said you just don't worry just say, 'I surrender everything to you Mother'. Finished. Don't try to do anything. Don't try to take out. Just surrender. They'll all run away. Otherwise they will be there creating a nuisance out of you.

You see the trouble is the whole society is individualistic, you see. So to get out of that individualistic society into a real social being, in the sense that it has to be a real Sahaja Yogi collective being, then one has to remember not to pay any attention to yourself. What is so important? [NOT CLEAR] who am I?

Sahaja Yogi: This is what I've been saying on Friday night.. It tends to be that people come in and they just think about themselves and they work on themselves without going to someone and saying, 'Can I help you? Can I do this for you?'

Shri Mataji: No, No. That is also another subtler work is that I'll help you. I'll do this for you. Because this is again the missionary part of it. I must tell you because Christians should be aware of it. What these missionary business of helping you. Whom are you helping? You are helping yourself. The more you are with others, the more you are enjoying yourself.

Sahaja Yogi : Being collective.

Shri Mataji: Just be collective. Just do it because you like it, you love it and by which you are the winner not the other. You are the ones who are going to gain not the others. The more you [you will do it?] the more you [will gain?] But, [it's becoming?] subtler and subtler. Like one would say that I am doing it because I become more powerful. What am I? Because after all ascent is the point, isn't it? You have to ascend. How far you have ascended in Sahaja yoga, how far your vibrations are alright, how far you have gone deeper is the main point. And that can only be achieved, only be achieved through surrender, nothing else. Nothing else. Before and after. Putting your attention, complete surrender. That will work out. That will absolutely neutralize all these things [UNCLEAR hypochondriac ...?] just put all the troubles onto Me.

Even to this point [INAUDIBLE] like he, Harry, I've been studying you people through him very well. That, just now I talked to Harry and I told him that how subtle it becomes that, he's a very nice person, good-hearted, everything. But the bhooths are not. So, today I talked to Maharaj, this fellow from Africa. And in his talk, I discovered, he said, I was talking about a doctor, and he told Me a sentence, "Mother, he is judging you". And that's how he got hot and I said, "That's it." Anything that judges Me is wrong, like, "She's doing this because She loves us." Even this point. Who are you? You see the subtleness, the subtle point behind this. Can you see it? That's what I told him. See Hanumana gets angry on this point. Hanumana, absolutely hundred percent. Who are you? Why should She love you? And because She loves us that's why you
must accept what am I saying to you.

What's that? Hello? Just open the door. Who else has come?

[Sahaja Yogini talking]

Hello your friend is coming is it? Who is coming? She is trying to talk to Me. She doesn't like when I don't pay any attention to her. All right. Hello. How are you? It is nice to see you. Sit down. Sit down.

So, how it becomes subtler and subtler, one should see. And one should face it. And when the subtle ways, I must say there is a difference between the senior Sahaja Yogis and this thing. You just see this. There is a understanding, there is. Anything should be done from the Sahaja Yoga point of view. Are we helping Sahaja Yoga or not. I think maturity comes with age. The concern should be Sahaja Yoga. And even if you, I mean I said you must take up jobs. You must earn. Have to work. You have to improve your styles and things. Somewhat, but for Sahaja Yoga. It's to be done for Sahaja Yoga. That's not the aim. Aim is Sahaja Yoga. That's the main point is. That Sahaja Yoga should be placed as the highest thing and then only it will work out, because all these subtle things will disappear. Otherwise these subtle things swallow you. And they come as [UNCLEAR], you see, and they will give you ideas and things and it will start losing sight of it, because you must know that you have been prophesized long time back. And you are doing such a tremendous work. It's such a great work you are doing. I wish you could realize it, because even that understanding is very subtle. Then all other things you just throw away. That Sahaja Yoga itself is self-established and have this self-esteem thing. It does not need from you. Only thing by taking it up yourself, you improve in your status. Like that. Now see you understand. You're doing no favor to Sahaja Yoga or to Mataji Nirmala Devi. You're doing favor to yourself. Now, this point is the point I tell you. All right? So you surrender.

Surrendering is the only way. There is no other way. And that’s why these problems can be solved now. So how do we do it?
May God bless you. Oh, God! Good, good, come along, come along. How are you? Good. Who else is coming from Cambridge?
Sahaja Yogi: I’m from Australia.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]. He stays in the ashram.
Shri Mataji: Come along. John will be coming. Dalla [unsure] would come, I’m sure.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Not yet arrived.
Sahaja Yogi: I know. [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: Hmm. How to do it?
"By not doing it", he said, "by surrender".
Sahaja Yogi: I’ll miss Mother that; It will then have a tendency to seat and there’ll be a big mess and there is no point in doing anything, because-
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Then you do everything. You see, when you become dynamic. If you are not becoming dynamic, that means you are a gone case. This is the judgment point.
Sahaja Yogi: We are all gone cases here then, Mother.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: No. You can’t say that now.
Sahaja Yogi: In fact, what we should be doing?
Another Sahaja Yogi: Let it be as it is.
Shri Mataji: You think so? I don’t think so. I’ve been praising you people all over. Of course, sometimes I used to get frantic. I must say the people in this country, have only one problem, is lethargy. I will say, get active also. They can be only bathroom cleaners. This is the problem.
So, the inactivity can be dangerous. But I’m saying of non-action. I’m not saying of inactivity, where the feeling that, "I’m doing something" is not there. We have to be active, extremely active, but say, "I’m not doing it ". Surrendered. If you are lethargic, then you are no good. I mean you are absolutely wrong, ‘tamasik’, left-sided. Well, if you are active and you know that, "It’s all surrendered, I’m not doing it ". Then inactivity is not non-action. Non-action is very different. Like the sun comes and gives you light. It just emits. It is non-action. It doesn’t say, "I’m doing it ". You see the difference between the two. It should be clearly understood.

Sahaja Yogi: Do you think, Mother, that sometimes there is a tendency to feel that if you do something in an active way, that you may get a catch in the left or right heart. Then there’s a sense, there is a tendency then not to do anything, since we go closer of your – you that you might go catching or doing something.
Another Sahaja Yogi: It’s hypochondriac thing.
Sahaja Yogi: And that’s the hypochondria.
Another Sahaja Yogi: I’m catching on left heart, so I can’t do anything... the whole day.

Shri Mataji: I mean, Sahaja Yoga is not for such cowards. They are useless, they better get out. You see, it’s meant for people who are real warriors, you see, we need soldiers.
Sahaja Yogi : We must fight now. We got to get out and fight.
Shri Mataji: They will go out of circulation, don’t you worry, all such people, very soon. So, those who are afraid of catching, they go out of circulation. Here we are not here to look after your chakras. We are here to work for Sahaja Yoga. When you start working for Sahaja Yoga, you are automatically cured and geared up. That’s what it is.
Sahaja Yogi: Donna said something very appropriate when we were talking. She said, "One just has to look at the little ones."

Shri Mataji: Yes. She is working for all of you left, right everywhere.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
That’s a game. That’s a game she’s playing. The game we are all in like you, smiling too.
Sahaja Yogi: This is what we must realize that they work very hard.
Shri Mataji: That’s true! Extremely, extremely hard. And they scream and shout and everything.
Sahaja Yogi: Cause it is quite obvious that when someone comes in, who’s got a bad catch, because the working-out starts immediately because of things.
Shri Mataji: What things? Better you learn from them. I should be the one, who is catching the most.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Yes! What happened?
Sahaja Yogi: Nothing bad.
Shri Mataji: There we have. Humm. Maybe that is, I don’t know. You see, it’s a mathematics, which cannot be calculated easily.
It’s the thing you go five steps forward, three steps backwards, eight steps forward, four steps backwards. Ten steps forward, eleven steps backwards. And where do you reach? What is the speed? That’s what England is.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
But everybody of the whole is progressing. No doubt, slow and steady. We’ll win the race.

Sahaja Yogi: I mean a wind of change came in the last week when this girl arrived from Australia. I mean it was really, someone I never met so positive and everything else like that.
Shri Mataji: They are the children of convicts, you see? So.
So fresh! Annick, there is another one. Her name was Annick. She met us in Orleans. She came all the way to meet Marie. Ah, you were there.
She went round and took all the posters. You see Marie, as usual, brought up from England. So, she said, "Mother, she didn’t tell me beforehand. She had put the advertisement in the paper. But, she didn’t find out when it was". So, it was on the third day the advertisement stopped. And there were no advertisements for the two days before. So, this Annick said, "Doesn’t matter". She went and put posters everywhere eight days before. Everybody put the posters. And on the poster only, Annick got so many. And Marie said, "Mother, I’m still an intuit, I don’ know. This thing happened; the third day we got all a big [unclear] crowd. But these people who came with the posters, stayed on for two days and really came up very well. And then, they started working it out. Now Paris is very well established.

But this is what it is and the way she, I mean, tremendous she was, isn’t it? Orleans, she did it very well. She is really tremendous. To her, Sahaja Yoga is her life. Absolutely.

Australians are going to show a way to you people, I think. The convicts are born here to pull us down everywhere, you go everywhere. You find those convicts, eh?
Sahaja Yogi: We need an exchange scheme.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Sahaja Yogi: We'll send some over there. No sense up here.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Shri Mataji: No, I think it is alcoholism, of the worst time. Now in front of her house, we find five, six of them permanently circle. One of them is a lady. Early in the morning, they are all drinking. And by yesterday we were, me and this doctor who has come, we were going down. One of them was standing with a bottle and was singing and going forward and backwards. So this Indian doctor got a fright. He said, "Better go by another road, because he may just shoot off". I said, "So this is what it is".
But Swiss people are very speedy, very speedy people. They are on the other side. They are so speedy. Means, you know, it's like a low train which never reaches the point. And the fast one which always misses the station, it is like that. I don't know which one to travel.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: That is the situation of the West is. So, when you realize all this, we must see and try to correct it. But only difference perhaps is that difference- difference I find in this, that they understand their mistakes. And-
Sahaja Yogi: It’s really the German section, I think. They really.
Shri Mataji: No, all of them. Swiss also. They also, they all understand. They say, "Mother, we are very speedy, we have to bring down, put down my speedometer". You see. And this is what we people do not realize, that we are lethargic here. The difference is, lethargic people they never realize because they don't even have so much strength to think of that, that we are lethargic.

My husband's place, Lucknow, is known for all kinds of lethargic people. So, they had a competition. They got all of them in a row and said, "Whosoever is the most lethargic, the laziest, walk one step forward". So everybody walks one step forward. But one was from England. He stayed back. So the people asked him, "Why didn’t you step forward?" He said, "I don't even want to do that".
[Laughter]

It’s true that was the laziest. So that should not do the case. All right?

See the working is on still, the right side, right side, right side. It's all working, yes, yes, yes, yes, it's going on all the time. Ah! It's working. Poor things. I have seen my grandchildren also. Aradhana, she was hardly three years or so, we had taken her to the airport. She said, "No, no", like that. She was going on like that, you see. So, Kalpana could not understand why she was so crazy, so fast.
[To other Sahaja Yogis] Hello, hello, hello!
Here comes then another mister [a baby boy]. Is he sleeping?
Sahaja Yogini: No, no. [Unclear] Kamala
Shri Mataji: Come along. Where will you sit new? Sit here.
How are you now? Better? All right, I'll see.

Ah! This one has come. This one, see. Just see this one.
May God bless you.
He's all right. Poor thing. [Baby screaming]
May God bless.
[Baby still screaming]
Shri Mataji [talking to baby]: What has happened? Hum?

He's catching from all of you. Poor thing.
[Shri Mataji is working on the baby]

May God bless you.

Hot. He's catching from all of you.

She’s helping him now.
Sahaja Yogi: She wants [unclear].
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Shri Mataji: How much they work, I tell you, really. Yes, yes. Hmm. Swadisthana.

So, this is what we have to do now. We have covered these points. Now about your travelling, when can you do it?
Sahaja Yogi: As soon as possible. I’ll write to her, if you want.
Shri Mataji: Ask Thomas, first of all. Will you go via Germany?
Sahaja Yogi: I think so.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Sahaja Yogi: The van, the combi is, you know that combi is, it takes very short time.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Rolthar has sent a thousand pounds to get the van fixed up. So, it can be used for Sahaja Yoga programs.
Shri Mataji: Really? Very sweet of him.
Sahaja Yogi: And if there's myself in a company, and one other person lately who can go, then we can stay in the van and do the cooking and everything else in the van.
Shri Mataji: Good idea. That's a good idea. Can it be fixed or not? Put it in.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it can be fixed.

Shri Mataji: So we should assign it to some proper. Find a-
Sahaja Yogi: Mark is organising.
Another Sahaja Yogi: What is Mark doing about the van?
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] to find the keys so he can take it there.

Shri Mataji: Now there's one thing I want to know, this Bard. You have to pay him some money or something?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, indeed.
Shri Mataji: I think we should send him the money. Otherwise, he's a nice fellow, but he's a great friend of one, Sinhalese. And this Sinhalese fellow wants me to go to Siloe. He's quite a nice person. And he's a great friend of Mr. Bard. And Bard has given a very funny picture about you.
Sahaja Yogini: He's very negative in general.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: He’s a very happy bachelor [unsure]. [Unclear] Well, when he will.
Shri Mataji: I never met him. I never met Bard. It was his friend who told me about it.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. Well, from our end what happened was-
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: Wendy was taking some things to sell, at this sort of junk shop. And Bard happened to be in the shop because he was a friend of the man who owned it. And he started saying all sorts of very derogatory things.
Shri Mataji: Come here, just I can’t hear you.
Sahaja Yogini: Sorry. He-
Shri Mataji: Where did she go?
Sahaja Yogini: Well, just by, oh sorry, amazing, well coincidence if you like, Wendy took some old books and stuff of ours to sell. And she happened to meet Bard in this sort of shop, second hand shop. And he happened to be a friend of the person who owns it, that was why he was in there. And he said lots of very derogatory things. And Wendy said, she said, "I don't think he's still in Sahaja Yoga ". And then she said, "Oh he said some very bad things about Peter ". So I said, "Well, you know, maybe... "
Shri Mataji: About Peter he said lots of things.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: But about Me, he said, "Mataji is too simple. She can't understand".
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: It's horrible things. Horrible things. Which I will tell him otherwise.
Sahaja Yogini: But the other strange thing that happened is that we haven't heard anything about him from the point of view of Sahaja Yoga. And last night he happened to ring up.

Now what happened was that, I think it was Anne on the phone and she didn't know, you know, the whole thing about Bard. And she said, "Yes, there's a puja tomorrow at four o'clock". And he said, "Can I speak to Harry? " So I said to Anne, because she was new to him, I said, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, put a hand over the phone sort of thing. And I didn't know if this was right, Mother, but I said that it was only an invited puja and that certain people, only people who had been invited should come. And it was only a small thing because I suddenly thought, you know, is there some negativity trying to sort of come in or? Anyway, he's probably coming to Caxton Hall because he said, "When is the next public meeting?"

Shri Mataji: No, no, he clearly said that, "I do believe in Sahaja Yoga". You see, this fellow was all praised for him, he said this. I said, "But he did pay some money. I believe what I heard is that electrical money and all that”. And he said, "No, he's not a man. If you tell him he'll pay. He's a [unclear] formal man for money matters". He said, "He is such a straightforward person, you can't imagine and he's a very fine person and most reliable". I mean, Sinhalese was all praised for him".
But he said, "He told about Peter, that Peter is a dangerous guy and all those things. And that's how he got out from there". And he said that, "Everybody will be in a jeopardy", lots of things which I'll tell you later. All right, whatever it is.

[To the baby] Now, what's happening? Why were you screaming so much?
Hello? Hello? All the time smiling and you are screaming for nothing at all. You are also smiling now. Why were you screaming? These people are troubling you a lot? Are they? Yes. So what do you do to them? You scream at them, you shout at them, he?

Gavin?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes
Shri Mataji: I won't be able to have lunch here because Mr. C. P. Srivastava said that, "Today at least have lunch with me". So, yesterday he told us I'd better go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh! What is it? What is it?
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear]
Now wake up. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
She has blue eyes.
Sahaja Yogini: Well, I don't know. You see Bumble started off with eyes that colour.
Shri Mataji: Yes, she's got blue eyes. That's a nice thing.
Sahaja Yogini: They changed.
Shri Mataji [to the baby]: Yes!
Who had blue eyes in your family?
Sahaja Yogini: Well, nobody. I didn't know either.
Shri Mataji: She has blue eyes. Oh, you’re all right. Are they? Better, hold her a moment.

So, this is what Bard has been doing, doesn’t matter. But in any case, we should send him money, whatever it is. You should say that, "You just disappeared and I have to send the money to him ". Then another thing is you have to see to it that, you see, when all such things start, one should not talk. Because, you see, whatever it is, money is different from Sahaja Yoga. And one should not talk like this. It brings bad a name to Sahaja Yoga. Nobody should talk. Whatever is the problem of money you can find it out. But why talk about it? It’s a wrong thing.

[To the baby] No? No, come. You come to Me for a while. All right?
I didn't take her so she...
[Laughter]
This dolly baby, this dolly baby. She doesn't cry. Dolly baby doesn't cry. Or you shout or not or scream sometimes, little bit. [Shri Mataji chuckles]
Look at the smile. Look at that, another one. Yes, still sleeping.
No, no, I'm talking to you. No, no, I'm not talking to you, I’m not talking to anybody else. I'm just talking to you. All right?
What happened? What happened? What happened? No, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. She has to take. Dolly. Oh, what happened? What happened? I just started talking to him and not to her. He? Is she hungry? I think she is. Oh, she is hungry. He? What happened?
She is hungry, I think. She is hungry. Work very hard. You have something too. All right, all right. She is hungry. Get her some book. You make a bottle, you have started?
Child: I ‘m gone one made up.
Shri Mataji: All right, so you’d better give. She is crying now.

So, what have you decided then?
Sahaja Yogi: I have one idea which I believe-
Shri Mataji: So just give Me.
Sahaja Yogi: Paul had also had the idea that we should maybe make a, try to make a sort of a documentary, film documentary about Sahaja Yoga. Perhaps on video. And then, I don't know, twenty minutes, half an hour or something. Then we could make copies of it, you see.
Shri Mataji: Whenever, but first actors should be all right now.
Sahaja Yogi: Well, we've got a few and you know, who are not too bad.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: I'm happy to hear.

Yes. You are so, thank you. Are these from your garden?
Sahaja Yogi: I'm afraid not, Mother. I'm still busy inside at the moment. I'm afraid I know.

Shri Mataji: I think [unclear] this is your tape and all that. I told Paul, I don't know if you understood Me or not. It is only handled when there are people to see it. Where do we have? Sahaja Yogi: Well, what I thought, there was one thing we could perhaps then approach people on television and show them, you see. Because-
Shri Mataji: But whom are you going to show?
Sahaja Yogi: Well, I don't know, but if you-
Shri Mataji: That's the main point, you know. You do all the experiments, you see. He came to me and he told me, make a video tape of things. Whom are you going to show, is the point. We have a reward, lots of things, but whom to show? Only we have to see ourselves.
Another Sahaja Yogi: There is a program on Sundays, I think it is, on television, which allows people to show, individuals and groups of people, they have their own program.
Shri Mataji: We have been-
Sahaja Yogi: And other things like that.
Shri Mataji: We have been asking them to give us even five minutes. They have not yet given us.

Sahaja Yogi: But the thing is, Mother, if we produce something which they could just see easily, then that would give them a much better idea of the quality of the thing. And it wouldn't actually be so expensive.
Shri Mataji: We have a film already with him. Now what you have to do is to edit it and do it properly, you see.
Sahaja Yogi: We can make one up quite cheaply, Mother. We can just, if we need to shoot the whole film, we can just hire the equipment for few days.
Shri Mataji: No, that's not difficult. What I'm saying that, we have already got to film.
[To the Sahaja Yogini] Now can you go out and open the door?
Now, the only thing you have to do is to get the photographs, I mean here to film it. He has got already a thing to film. Get it edited, you see. And when you come to India this time, people, then we can get more films from India, add them up together. This time when I go, I think I can borrow your camera or something and we can work it out.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I was thinking, Mother.
Shri Mataji: And then, all that put together, then we can make a nice film here.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that's what I thought that we can have.
Shri Mataji: Well, work it out. That is one of mine.

Sahaja Yogi: And we could have some sort of introduction to explaining what Sahaja Yoga is as well. Showing the chart, and so introduce.
Shri Mataji: You can do it. But these are little confusing ones, you see. Like puja and all that. Sahaja Yogi: Oh no, it would have to be –
Shri Mataji: But I’ll have to take a film.
Hello, Don, hello, how are you? May God bless you.
I'll take a film - come along, sit down -from here.
And Raman is very good at it. And I'll ask him to help Me there. He's going to give Me his projector, which will you, I'll bring it to London. We can use that projector. But you see, the film is, the film that they have here is 60 millimetres, isn't it?
Sahaja Yogi: What we have is Super 8. They also have a Super 8 film there. That's how I know.
Shri Mataji: Just find out. Because somebody told Me that this cannot be converted into that.
Sahaja Yogi: Into what?
Shri Mataji: Into films on the TV.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, it’s quite easy, Mother. 16 mm, 8 mm films are used, actually, in even certain-
Shri Mataji: Why don't you find out? You see, somebody, do you know in the...
Sahaja Yogi: Quite a lot, Mother. I've known, it's used quite a lot because TV cameramen take out their Super 8 sometimes when they can't film in a situation. And then they film with Super 8, and then at the TV studios, they have a machine which converts it onto video tape.
Shri Mataji: Ah, you can do it. No problem.

Another Sahaja Yogi: We might be able to use it for programs, Mother. I mean, in remote places, if you're not going Mother, we could. I mean, lots of people would come to see a film when they wouldn't come to see her for a lecture, you know what I mean. Just because you produce some sort of a thing, people would come and see it.
Shri Mataji: We can do it. We can get it from India. I mean, I had this idea before also. That's one of the things we could do. But his idea was different. What idea Paul gave Me was of no use, I thought. He said that why not we all get a video and see the program. I said, what's the use? We are the seers and we are the doers.
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, I wasn’t thinking in that line. [1:01:46]

[...transcript in progress ... ]

[1:19:44]
I mean this is, and the Protestants are also horrible people, I think. I don’t know what to do with them. They are in another way, horribly fanatics, you see, horribly fanatics.

There was one priest who came, he was a Catholic priest, he came to see Me in ordinary dress. And I must tell you some good news also. So, I didn't recognize him but he could not get Realisation. So, he wrote Me a letter through his friend that, "Mother, I must tell you I was seeking but in Catholicism, seeking is not allowed. And I am a priest and I did not get married for the Savouries. So, I went to, I have been going to a guru, I went to him for three months. He lives near Siloe. Maybe that is the reason, I am not getting Realisation".
So, I saw the vibrations, I said, "No, he is a Realised soul this guru". And I took down his address. So he said, "You know, his good friend told me, that he has already told him that ‘I cannot give Realisation. Mother has come on this earth. She herself is in person, you better go and get it from her’." And he told about her. She is her Holiness. She is Adi Shakti, everything he told. Imagine! This guru.
But the better thing, I'll tell you. We went to Spain and the girl who came with us, Miriam, was no good for translation. So first day somebody offered his services, he said, "All right, I'll translate ". He did well. But second day, you see, this fellow did not turn up, he was late. And one boy - I have got his address also, I think she has got - he turned up. And he was very good. He organized everything, did everything, he was very good at English and he translated the whole thing very well in Spain and helped.

So, he told these people, "You see, my guru lives on Himalayas. I went and see; some guru Swami or something, Namnemi he told Me. And I felt the vibrations were all right. And he told me that, ‘You go to Madrid. Mataji is coming there, go and help her and help her in every way’. "
[Laughter]
Great! And then he just disappeared, I never saw him.

And then, of course the hall was so shocking, there were a lot of hikes out there. But we managed somehow. It's all right, we managed, it's not difficult, we can manage these things. Only Rome was bit too much, he, Gavin?
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

You know, you had to pay that.
Sahaja Yogi: I haven't paid it back yet, but I'm going to.
Shri Mataji: You’d better not pay them.
Sahaja Yogi: I paid them beforehand.
Shri Mataji: Hmm, that's the problem.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: No, I paid for the other things like bill they gave Me, big bill for the hotel rooms and taxi and this. You see, next day we didn't know what to do. So, what we did, we took lot of these pamphlets and took a taxi and went round postering them. So, it cost us about fifty pounds on the taxi.
[Laughter]

But what to do, I mean, we didn't know what to do? Because it never appeared.
Sahaja Yogi: You stayed in a hotel room? And you stayed in a hotel room? The hotel room is about the most expensive there.
Shri Mataji: Very expensive, I tell you! Dinner : for one dinner for both of us, fifteen pounds. Sahaja Yogi: But you don't eat in here, you don't stay in hotels in Italy. No one stays there, unless they're very, very well off.
Shri Mataji: I don't know, then where do you stay? There's no place.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Even in this hotel they had no dinner, you know?
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, they don’t have any.
Shri Mataji: So they said, "You have to go now to this". We said, "We can't go to far off places where we can get some pizza or something, you know, to manage further ". So they said, "No, this is nice place, you can go ahead ". And fifteen pounds, I said, "Very nice for both of us ". Seven and a half pounds to however eat. So much, I thought, but they're very expensive. Then what we did was to get a pizza, you see. But in the night, we just couldn't do anything.
Sahaja Yogi: The places to stay in Italy are in the "Pensiones ", they're very extremely private, there are people's homes, they really aren't -
Shri Mataji: Now we don't have to worry, Gregoire is going to be posted for ten months.
[Shri Mataji chuckles]
He has taken the responsibility now. He's going to work it out.
