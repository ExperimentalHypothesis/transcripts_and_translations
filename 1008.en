Public Program. San Francisco (USA), 28 September 1983.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. For the Mother….the greatest moment is that when she sees her children, get all her qualities, all her wealth and all her power. There is nothing more she wants. I am so proud of Yogi that he has so steadily worked it out for so many great souls that have been seeking. As he says that seeking can be very much misleading if you do not know what you are seeking. But you will be amazed that those people who are also mislead, have done all kinds of mistakes. Have gone wrong. Have taken to lives which can only be ended. They also today are to be saved. And they all can be saved. God’s love is a bounty. It’s so great that I am myself amazed at its operation. The way it has forgiven. The forgiveness is so intense. The love so sweet and delicate. And the way it works out the beautiful correction. Which you also do not feel how you are corrected. It’s such a blessing of these modern times. It was never so easy before. And thus, I have to just say that you are very fortunate seekers. Formally the seekers had to go to Himalayas to cut themselves off from the whole world. Live with very strict gurus. Who would first beat them nicely to see if they were healthy enough and then they would starve them to see that the (UNCLEAR) of their sense of taste. All sorts of tests were taken to make the guru satisfied otherwise he would through them down. Today it is the other way round. The such gurus in those days never used to please the disciples. Never!! They never tried to see that the disciples are not upset. But today, I see how sweetly this power is correcting. One has to understand that these are the days of our last judgement. This is the last judgement. We are not going to be judged by anything else but our kundalini. Which resides within us. Its said in all the scriptures. But people do not understand that at the time of judgement you will be resurrected also. You are to be resurrected. The one who has created you, the one who has worked so hard, has to be worried about his creation. If he does not worry, who is going to look after? And that is what i find the anxiety of the divine to save all the seekers. Who are the epitome of evolution. It is a special category of human beings. You could be anything but a seeker is a definitely a special category of people. As william blake has said that “men of God, meaning seeker. Will become prophets. And they will have powers to make others prophets.” that’s what it is. The time has come. The blossom time has come. And at this time thousand of flowers have to become fruits. Beautifully. Not with troubles, not with tears. Not with joy but complete uplifting. And a joyous life thereafter. So you must know that you are a special category of people. You are the people who are going to lead the whole world ahead. Those who are lost in the mundane things, in the seeking of joy in power or money. You shouldn’t worry about them. Or should not think that they are absolutely useless. They are going to follow you but first you have to establish yourself. You have to become good sahaja yogies as we call it. Today, as we know Sahaja yoga should be called as Maha yoga. It is written that when sahaja yoga will be done in a mass basis then it becomes maha yoga. Its described so many times in indian scriptures, and by many saints. And they have been looking forward this happening a mass. I just witness all the beauty. The bounty. The great technique, the divine technique. How it works on such a mass scale. As you know thousands and thousands come to my program, and all of them get realization just like that. It is too fantastic to believed, it is too true to be believed. But one must know that you are fantastic. (Public cheering) You are great. There is something so great in you that you are not even aware of it. But once you become that it works out in such a marvelous way that you are amazed at yourself how you can do it. Now today’s special request from yogi and all - how to sustain our realization? How to keep it going?
So let us see what are our real enemies. You should know them, who are they and if you start witnessing yourself now, it won’t be a mental projection. But whatever you think, or whatever you put your attention to it will act. According to indian calender or what we call as panchanga. This is the yuga which is called as “Krita yuga”. So kaliyuga is over with my birth I think. And now the krita yuga has started. And “Kruta yuga” means where it will act. God’s love will act. This power of Brahma will act. So this is a new dimension into which the all pervading power of God has started acting. So when you think of something that acts. So let us see what are our problems and how we get dragged down. 
The first and foremost problem we have is the physical one. Which comes to us sometimes hereditary, sometimes from our birth and sometimes we develop ourselves. So we should know what physical problems we have and we should face it. We all can cure our physical problems. But certain things people do not understand. Like you go to a big departmental store, a sahaja yogi specially. And he gets completely drained off. I have taken some of them with me to buy some presents. They all ran out and said Mother we are all going to sit outside. We just can’t sit in here it’s too much. And they sit on the steps just like small children waiting for me to come out. There is no one even to help me with things. (Shree Mataji smiling as the crowd laughs) so they said- Mother why it happens to me? Like this if I travel, why do I get drained off? Why physical energy sort of gets completely drained off? So the thing is that now as we have become the channel of God, the energy is sucked in by other people who are sitting around or those are in that place or who are working there very hard. It’s perfectly alright. Because you have chosen to be the channel. But if the channel is completely dragged. In the sense, that if everything gets exhausted you also feel the drain for the time being. But at that time, its a very simple technique, Divine technique which we should know that the source of our energy comes from our spirit. Which resides in our heart. At this time, if you say- “I am the spirit. I am not this physical being. I am the spirit. Why should i be drained out?” You can put your hand on your heart. If you want. Or you can just put your hand round your heart. Like this...(Shri Mataji rotating hand in a clockwise manner on the heart giving it a bandhan to show people) so that you start bringing your spirit into your attention. And the attention that is dragged outside becomes completely nourished. So one must know that kundalini is the nourishing thing for you. As soon as you start bringing the spirit in your attention the kundalini rises and when she rises, she gives strength to your physical being. As it is you know these chakras are made up of elements. First two chakras are made up of Mother Earth. So the Mother Earth is a very important thing for us. For such people who feel very dragged down in their physical energies you must try to sit on the Mother Earth. She is one who really now has acting the “Kruta”. It has started working. So far we had been getting at her all the time. This is the only element the Mother Earth which does not act spontaneously on us. Only the gravity of Earth acts and we are gravitated towards Earth. Otherwise for all her other qualities we have to go to her. Like we have to dig in, and we have to plant somethings so that somethings grows and then we have to go to her. I mean you have to put some sort of an effort to get to her to use her energy of nourishment. But she is the most nourishing thing. SHe is the one, who is nourishment personified. So when you sit on her, and request her and if you are a realized soul, you’ll find an upsurge of energy coming up. Not only that, she comes up to your head and takes down all that is not wanted. So it’s sort of a cleaning process comes up first of all. Then you are filled with energy of Mother Earth. Now these days you find a craze for jogging. It’s a very common thing. Only we should grant when it is necessary. It is unnatural to run like this mad. (People laughing) if you run like this all the time, when the time to run will come you will never be able to run. (Crowd laughing a loud again) Actually when you run, what you do is you fight the frictional force of Mother Earth. All the time you are hitting her with your shoes, feet and everything. In a good Indian Family, the first prayer when you get in the morning when you have to put your foot on the Mother Earth, you have to say- “Padsparasham Kshamasva Me” Means- Oh Mother! Please forgive me for I am touching you with my feet. 
First thing you have to say, you Mother forgive me because I am touching you with my feet. Now when I say this, I know some of you may start taking your shoes out and walking on the street. You must respect your feet first and then the Mother Earth. Without your feet being looked after you can’t take the vibrations of the Mother Earth. But a respect! Respect for all the elements must be developed. It is not like a primitive respect that people had. Is a respect that comes out of enlightenment that you know that all these elements give us nourishment. Especially the Mother earth. Now I have seen also people trying to extract things from Mother Earth absolutely without any discretion and you know what is the result today. The matter that is extracted is converted into things like plastic, this that all useless things. And for this poor Mother EArth has been torchered and da(unclear) whatever is necessary, you must do. That she likes very much because she is there as a Mother. But unnecessarily when we torture her it’s not being very fair to her. And that is what i feel sometimes that we must put attention to the consumption of matter that we use. For example many people now have realized that the plastic is not good. For the skin, its not good for food. If you eat food with plastic it can give you trouble and people are quite frightened about the plastic. Now this plastic reacts in us because its Anti Mother. And it acts in a very subtle way within us. It creates a barrier between the Mother Earth and ourselves. And this is a very big threat for all of us to understand that we should not try to use plastic very much in our day to day life. As far as possible, try to have a few things. Like you can do with one glass for your drinking. But when we went first to London, my husband we’ll have to have people who drink. Because they won’t come to our house if you don’t have things for them to drink. I am very (inobvious UNCLEAR) I don’t understand all this. You do what you like. Poor man, he went to the shop ...this I am telling you is about ten years back. Went to the shop to find out different tumblers that are to be used. And he first had to go through a training. And i was amazed that at that time he had to pay about thousand pounds to get all kinds of glasses/tumblers...for one thing one glass for another thing another glass. Why can’t they have one glass? (Crowd laughing) it’s a headache. These are the norms that we have made by which we have made our lives (UNCLEAR)  there is no need to have so many tumblers in the house. Supposing then you give a particular glass for a particular thing then they’ll say they are not sophisticated. This sophistication has led us to use so many things and variety to such an extent we are loosing. This is just ah...ego trip i should say that we want to have so many varieties. Even we try to have variety in simple things like motor car handles. If you get into an american car first find out how it opens. And into the bathroom, Be careful!! (people laughing) I came to San Fransisco I remember, which was a very paush house in Monterey. I didn’t know what sort of a house it was and the gentleman was I think was a bachelor who was divorced or was about to divorce his wife and as soon as I stepped into the bath suddenly I got completely drenched. (Crowd laughing)...I put my foot somewhere. So the attention is wasted first of all in creating variety. You can have variety in color scheme, in wood, in something that is natural. You can have variety to create beauty. But this kind of variety and the amount of time we waste in creating variety is absolutely unforgiven. Because it leads your attention to matter. Now french people for example I would say, ahhh! You take them to some French cuisine. You will have a nice time with them. They will take one discussing what they are going to have. Very seriously! You see, as if they are discussing about atomic war. And for one hour they will be just discussing what they are going to have. I mean i don’t understand what is there to waste so much energy on such a thing that what you are going to eat. I mean, in India, we are quite healthy people and whatever is cooked in the house all of us eat. There is no problem of deciding. Now this is the trick played by the hoteliers or the restaurant people that we have so many varieties. So they put you into that kind of a ego orientation, where you start feeling- “Oh! I can decide whatever I want to have.” and you go on worrying about these things. Then he has to make ten types of foods, some food is consumed and some is not consumed, something is thrown out. Such a waste comes out of this madness is to choose. If you go and want to buy something say simple thing like a lamp. It’s not easy! They’ll say now, what you want? I said “I want a simple lamp to read. Now, this has got the blue of the green of the yellow! And that has got this of the this of the this...and that has got that of that of that….you say now, I want a simple lamp. Can you give me some lamp which I can use for my reading?  Oh No! You see..You have to decide.  You came back. You don’t know which one to buy...what to buy? Because it is too much of choice. And this too much of choice you should decide for all your life for once for all. Like, say my blouses! Now this blouse I decided when i was i think I was twelve or thirteen years of age when I started wearing sarees. The style is the same. My tailor knows what is my size is, he knows my blouse, how to make it. Finished! Once for all decided. No more headaches. (Crowd cheering) so the blouse has to be the same. But we had some people who were very much westernised and they would go on cutting the size of the sleeve here and then putting the sleeve here, then bringing the sleeve here then going up like that all the time moving their sleeves up and down. And ultimately I found that they always were lost in the race. Because they didn’t know what was the latest. You see, going on. All these fashions and all these things are created to make you mad. For a sahaja yogi, he should have his own fashion. Once for all decided. This is my dress. I am going to wear this. Finished! That way men are wiser than women, in this respect. They just wear the three piece suit, Finished! Whether it is hot or cold makes no difference. Three piece suit, they will be moving about and they will be having very nice time. But not now. Now, they have become very active about it and any number of fashions are created...I met a lady in Hong Kong. She was so thin that I thought she was suffering from Tuberculosis. But still she was on diet. I said, “Why are you on diet?”. So she told me that there is a particular type of a dress she likes which doesn’t fit her because she is slightly fat. I said, “Are you for the dress? Or dress is for you?” why should you make your body suffer for that dress which somebody has created. So the people are playing these games with you just to make money. And understand this point. Sahaja yogis must understand it much better. That we are not going to the persuaded or to be controlled by anyone like that. We are above  these things. Nobody can control us. There is no slavery anymore of anything. So we move further with this the clothes and things like that. Then the food. Now, indians are the worst for this, I must say. Because indians are very particular about what they want to eat. They are the worst husbands because you have to give them the taste. But with other people you see, whatever you give them, they’ll eat.They are that way much better. Because their eyes are more developed but not their food habits. So we go on wasting our time on these things. And then you say, we have no time Mother for meditation. How will you have time? When you are wasting your time on such and such thing. So try to make your demands as less as possible. But that doesn’t mean by any chance that you become a sanyasi. A sanyasi is not allowed in Sahaja yoga you know very well. But not to be driven into this madness. What should I buy, this I should buy or that I should buy. Those thing (UNCLEAR) your attention is completely diverted. Now i tell you what. The best thing you know about matter is this, that you can express your love through the matter. Before coming here, before going to Los Angeles, I was busy shopping. For presents to all the people who are there. I really evacuated most of it in Los Angeles. Then again I went for shopping to buy something for people here. Now i have to go other places, that’s all. I just enjoy that. Because you can communicate better. Better than words, better than anything. You give a little thing, it remains with them. They see it, Oh! Mother has given it. It’s such a big thing for them. They may have the greatest thing of the world. The richest things but the Mother has given me this one. (26:25-UNCLEAR) the vibrations are there. Now, you must know that you are sahaja yogis, you have got vibrations. You have a new awareness. You are in the fifth dimension. You are in the fifth dimension, not in the fourth but in the fifth dimension.  At this stage when you are in the fifth dimension, you must understand that you can find out about every matter through your vibrations. So whatever you want to buy, you should see the vibrations. You’ll be attracted to a thing which will be most vibrating and would be the cheapest. Go to any shop. Because all the rest do not understand the vibration. So they go in for something that is not really full with the coefficients to give vibrations. So that should be the cheapest. The other day i went, wanted to buy something of silver. And I said, this is the best. And there were three four sahajyogies, they said- AH!! BEAUTIFUL, it is so delicate one. I said this is the one we will buy. And she said this is the cheapest. So you get the cheapest thing, the best thing, and the vibrations. And what you want is available there. So we need not put our attention too much into this. One person decides that I am going to buy a particular thing. I must have a particular thing. Why? Why do you want to have only a particular thing. You may go to buy a shirt you may end up with a tie. Why? What’s the harm? See, one should take the life in not such a very fixed your attention with obstinacy on anything. If your attention is kept mobile. You somewhere, alright! This is what is available, is sufficient. The attitude towards life of all the sahaja yogis should be that yes! Now we have come, if you are late, it’s alright. If you are not late, it’s alright. You are there. You are not lost. As long as you are not lost, there is no need to be agitated. Just sit down with yourself. Because yourself is the spirit. If you can develop that kind of an attitude, I tell you, you will be above many things that bother you. Regarding comfort now. We come to the part, where we are trying to find out comfort out of this matter. Now be careful on that part. For sahaja yogis.. the comfort crawls upon. We have come out of the matter, don’t forget that. We have come out of the matter. And we have to become the spirit. This is the natural course that has to take place. But because we have come out of the matter, it is very easy for us to go back to matter. Very easy. Anything, that is material can always overpower,  for example, a tree is dead. From dead we make another dead thing. Say, a chair. Now if there is a chair, we can not sit on the ground. Chair becomes our dominating feature. Wherever we go we carry a chair with us because we can’t sit. If we get used to very comfortable back then you can not sleep on the ground. So these things, when they start crawling upon you, you must know that your spirit is being dominated by matter. I do not say that you all start sleeping on the ground, No! That’s not the thing. Don’t take to the other extreme. But say for example, me (Shree Mataji points towards herself to explain the point). You can ask anyone. Some people came to see me in London, I have a really very nice house I should say. Very nice and I have a very nice bathroom and a bedroom. Absolutely very nice. No doubt. According to them. But to me it does not matter. When i go to the villages, i sleep anywhere. I go for a bath in a river, I can do. I mean, I have no problem. Nothing can dominate me. Because I am myself completely regal in my temperament. Nothing can dominate me. If you are regal, what can allure you to anything. But that does not mean, now you go and sleep on the stones. It does not mean that. When you become the spirit automatically it will happen to you. That you will not need any particular kind of a comfort nor will you care for it. If you get it, well and good, if you don’t get it well and good. You are not bothered. You are not going to waste your time on that. Now, formally they used to take saints into cells. Put them there in the caves. To make their lives absolutely uncomfortable to train their bodies to be able to bear all kind of heat and cold. But that is not necessary after realization. Once you are realized, there is no need at all to torture your body. Your body automatically takes to that. Today we haven’t got another great disciple of mine who worked in Australia. But when he first came to me i had a very bad time with him and he had a bad time with me. Because we said, I told him if you are coming with me, it’s absolutely spartan. Worse than sparta. So if you are coming with me, be prepared with anything. He said, “I am prepared Mother, I don’t mind.” I said, Alright! Come along. He and his friend both of them came. And next day in the morning, both of them were furious. You see, they packed up their things and put them in the rickshaw and were going away. I said, what happened? He.. “I slept on the cement.” Really? I am sorry for that. But how it happened?(Shree Mataji asked him, then he replied- There were only two mattresses and three people and I had to sleep on the cement. The other said, I slept on the cement and they were very angry. They went to the market and bought two big mattress. Thick ones like that, and were carried them on their heads. And all the Indians started laughing at them because its not done in India to carry mattress like that on the head. Then they were even more furious, these stupid people don’t understand anything. We are so uncomfortable, this that. And they brought two mattresses there. So I said, alright! Will you be carrying these mattresses with you? They said, yes. We will carry them to Delhi. But somehow, they lost it again. (Laughter) now it was too much for them to believe that they have lost the mattress on which they could sleep. I said, are you going to carry your mattresses to the Kingdom of God? And that made them think..in the kingdom of God- the comfort comes from your spirit. If the spirit is comfortable, you are comfortable. If your spirit is not comfortable you are not comfortable. And how the spirit gets uncomfortable? That we should try to see. Now, by understanding what makes the spirit unhappy. Say, the music-comes from matter. If you see the thing was played, was made of matter. But when you play it, the beauty of you see..that resonance create such a beautiful aura. 
In the same way, we must use our spirit to play upon the matter to create beauty and not to make ourselves ugly and slaves of the matter. The spirit has to work out in this way, within every sahaja yogi. And once you know how to work it out, you become such a free person. You are not bothered as to how you travel, as to what you do, where you are. You are in complete peace and harmony with yourself. Otherwise it’s a headache. I tell you, It’s a big headache. You have to insure, you have to do this, you have to do that. If matter means headache better not have it. But, if it means joy then it’s all right! Because that is the quality of the spirit to relate to you from matter to itself. Just see now, people used to say spirit is not matter. Yes, true! Spirit is not the matter but matter is the one that contains the spirit. Supposing you are souls, in the sense dead souls. I can not give you realization at all. You have to be a living personality. You have to be in this matter, in this body only then realization can work out. We can not give to the people who are dead. The realization. We can not. So matter, in a way is important and the purity of matter that we have to achieve within ourselves. And that we can achieve through various methods of -First of all, the cleansing of our being- properly. Even when we think about bad thing and harming others and injuring others. We need not use weapons but we use our tongue. Then we are hurting them with the matter. That is the tongue. This tongue is to be used for saying something that is soothing, nourishing. Also it can be used as cleansing but you must reach that state of sweetness. And that state of glory, from where if you speak about cleansing- people accept it slowly and the whole thing works out it’s own way. This is what is very important because you know the west has become more grown outside like a tree. The more material development has come. You see that very clearly, though you are now fed up of it but it has grown. It has grown so big that you can not just run away from it. Like some people said, that we dress up like a primitive person, because we want to become primitive. But you can not. Because your brain is modern. How can you be primitive? Just by changing dress or anything you can not become primitive. You can not get the peace of a primitive man. So what you have to do is to make this modern brain absolutely adjusted to your spirit. And you’ll be amazed. After sometime when this toresial attack of your thoughts subsides. Then you feel your peace within yourself. And that peace gives you enjoyment of matter in a very different way. Like, I would say- Mona Lisa’s painting. Or the sistine chapel. If you have seen, if you go there and you look at it and you just don’t think because it makes you thoughtless. To sahaja yogies. It gives vibrations and you just watch it without thoughts. To watch something without thought is the gift of sahaja yogis. Because when you watch something, say i watched this piece, then I start thinking how much it must have cost, I hope it doesn’t get spoiled if Mother sits there or something goes wrong with it. So these ideas start crawling into your head. And the whole joy of its creation, the love with which it has been put and all that is finished. So at that time, if you can see the thing without thinking. It’s a very big thing, we do not realize that the computer which has development alongside with our evolution, can not produce a human mind. Even which is not realized. Because we just see without thinking. If you are here, I am just seeing you. I need not think. But when you are a realized soul then you see a thing and you just don’t think at all about it. And the joy of this creation starts pouring on you. Now, when you go further with it, as it’s said in the Bible- whatever is created by Mother Earth should not be reproduced and should not be worshipped. So, what does that mean? That the Mother Earth has created something. Now, what does Mother Earth has created? We do not know if Mother Earth has created anything which can not be reproduced. But after realization, you will see that at different points you will suddenly start to get vibrations. Like your “Stonehenge” I would say. In England I discovered so “stonehenge” is one of that. This whole thing, came out of the Mother Earth giving vibrations. But people did not know what it was so they cut it and made some circles and pieces from that. But actually the whole thing has come out of Mother Earth as it is. Now, a realized soul. When he makes like a statue, I have seen the MAtreda Statue of Mother Mary gives tremendous vibrations. No doubt about it. It gives tremendous vibrations. But may be, the reproduction of it will not give. So after realization you start understanding that the form of the formless starts giving vibrations if it is done by a realized soul. If it is supported by realized soul. To such an extent that supposing now, I am here. And I touch something, if its a sensitive sahaja yogi he can feel it that Mother has touched it. Because there are vibrations left. Permanently Eternal. Ill give you an example. I went to Kashmir once, and we were going to a very lonely place. Suddenly I said, what this place is? So the driver said, “No, it’s all wilderness.” No, I said, No, there must be a temple or something. He said said it is all wilderness, there is nothing here. So I told my husband, that I feel tremendous vibrations in this area. Let us follow the vibrations. So went along the little smaller road and there we saw some muslims living there. So we asked them, is there any religious place here. He said yes! This is called as Hazrat Iqbal. That is, one hair of Muhammad Saa’b was kept in that mosque. And I caught it from about 5-6 miles away from that place. One hair of Muhammad Saa’b. One nail of Lord Buddha. One that dress of Jesus Christ. These...how will you make out? Because of Vibrations. With vibrations you know this is the place. There are ….all controversies can be resolved whether it belongs to Christ or not. Everything can be explained. Whether it was the hair of Muhammad Saa’b or not on vibrations. If it has vibrations, it is so. So many things this Mother Earth has done for us to emit vibrations for our well being. To keep the atmosphere clean. She emits innocence. She is the one who emits innocence. And that innocence definitely looks after our well being. It tries to guide us in proper place. There is another example, I went to a place. A very small place called Bhosalewadi in  Maharashtra. And they told me that they wanted to make a retaining wall for the water the water that was accumulated and they called it lake. So that lake was to be given a band, as they call it. And about 60-70 years back they say, and engineer, an English engineer tried to build it. But at a point say about 30-40 feet area he just could not do it. Whenever he tried to do that the whole thing used to fall off. The day time they would build, next morning they would see that the whole thing has fallen off. He has written it now in his letter that ”I didn’t understand what it was.” Then a saint came in and he said that this is a place that is vibrating place. And you can not build here. So the thing is built in a round way. If you go there, you are a realized soul. You’ll find that cool breeze coming out tremendous cool breeze even if it is the hottest day. You find an air conditioner working. But only the sahaja yogis can feel it. That’s the main point. Not the others. They can not feel it. So you can feel the  air conditioner working there of this Mother Earth who is looking after us. She has done so many things for us and in the patanjali yoga, her blessings are called as “Ritambhara Pragya” which is a very important thing we have to understand. That when the spirit starts shining in our attention, and the Mother knows about it then she fills us with Ritambhara Pragya. Now this Ritambhara Pragya can be translated like this- Ritambhara, Ritu means the seasons. The Mother changes the season. The mother changes the seasons. And this Mother Earth, as she chooses her seasons and changes the seasons ..that means that she fills this universe with beauty of the seasons. When the knowledge of that becomes  “Pragya”. “Gya” means the knowledge and “Pra” means enlightened becomes enlightened then you start seeing that how beautifully she guides. How beautifully she bathes you. And how beautifully she nourishes you. It’s amazing how she works. Once, I went down to Kuala Lumpur. And there I was alone. No other sahaja yogi. And all the kinds of diseases you see, walked into me there. They said we have to be cured. They were about thousand people in that garden and didn’t know what to do. Then I just asked the Mother Earth I said, Now, you better help me. And all of them, I asked them to sit down. They were mostly Indians. They all sat down on the ground and most of them got cured. They published it in the newspaper that it was an amazing that happened. But the best was the little boy of 12 years who was brought by the parents who had polio. He couldn’t even walk. He was sitting there. They said, “where has he gone?” “he is lost! Where has he gone?” he had just got up and walked off. This Mother Earth is such a big thing. We have no idea. And her consciousness that we have to now know is what is “Kundalini.” Kundalini represents Mother Earth in you. The feminine love. The feminine qualities. Now we talk of feminist, off course that feminism is something absurd. To become man to the woman and then woman to the man. It’s all pendulum like movement. And you know that whatever moves in the pendulum, its not progressive. You have to move in a spiral. I hope you understand about the peptos. You see, if they become linear, then they get destroyed. All their identities is lost. But if they regain their spiral nature then they progress. In the same way, we too have to go in our consciousness in a spiral way jump higher than what we are. And that’s only possible by the spring of the kundalini. Which is nothing else but the representation of the Mother Earth within us. She is the Mother Earth. So now, what do we have to become? We have done all this aggression and competition then all kinds of things. We have grown so big. Now we have to go to our roots. We have to get to that force that will nourish us. That is the kundalini, which is also “Kumbha” in Sanskrit language. Meaning the Aquarius. That is why, it is called as the age of the Aquarius. Aquarius is the Kundalini. And this Aquarius is going to nourish us, soothe us and take us to that place where resides God’s place is the spirit. She is the one who gives us this union as Yoga. So, one has to understand that the pendulum moment is just mental projection. If you move into one direction, then you can move into another direction. It’s all linear. If you see, all your enterprises are linear. That’s why they move this side your political thing(INAUDIBLE) it calls back. You don’t understand what have we done wrong you see. Then you try to go the other way round it again calls back. You try to develop your size it becomes ...atomic bomb there. Anything you try to develop it becomes a devil. You can’t understand why? We were moving properly why it becomes a devil and starts attacking us back..why it is destroying us? The reason is that the movement is linear. You have to move spirally higher with your consciousness as the state where you become a compassionate, loving, nourishing, soothing personality. 

This country had produced a very great man, “Abraham Lincoln.” I used to adore him from my childhood. And this man has brought such a great qualities. In you, all of you lies that trick of Abraham Lincoln. And then the Sahaja yogis will rise as a great realized soul. I am sure, you will all will be achieving that fulfilment, that nourishing quality, that soothing quality and also that Divine love. Which is so pure, without any lust or greed. That’s what you all are going to exhibit, and it is going to act. That’s the part we should know after realization. Now, it is going to act automatically. Whether you like it or not, it will act. And you will be amazed how things will work out. So just be on the lookout for all these beautiful things begin. 
May God Bless you! 
Tomorrow again, I’ll tell you about other things and other chakras. I hope I have been able to tell you how to sustain it by understanding that you have to develop the qualities of soothing, of compassion, of love, of sweetness. And that you can develop by watching yourself. 

There was a guru, who was a realized soul had a very evolved personality. And he lived in a cave up in the mountain. So I wanted to go and see him. So all the sahaja yogis said, “Mother you never like a guru.” No, I said. When did I say that? I don’t like agurus. Who are not gurus. But he is a great man and I must go and see him. He is my fan. And he is only hundred and eight years of age. (crowd laughing) they said Mother, how will you do it? I said, I will do it. Don’t you worry about me. I am going to climb up. So I said, you see the vibrations. Before asking a question, see the vibrations. The vibrations started coming. Now this gentleman, poor man. He didn’t come to America but his hands and legs were broken in India. He was absolutely useless to do any good work because he thought he can’t even walk. But he had a tiger, on which he sort of moves about. And he lives in a cave. So when I went up...He also had a great power to control the elements. As far as the rain is concerned, he has a great control of rain. So when I went up, it started raining very heavily. And he got very angry. And he said, what is this rain? And why is it like this? When I went up he wouldn’t look at me and he was doing like this, like this….(Shree Mataji shaking her head left and right to give the expression of that guru and everyone laughs)              
And he wouldn’t look at me. When I went up, I went and sat nicely. He had made a nice seat for me everything. I sat down. And then, he came up to me. He said, “why did you keep the rain like that?” I can’t even give you a clear day when you are coming to see me that’s my Mother after so many days (INAUDIBLE) I said, see now. Don’t be angry with the rain. He said, it must be my ego that you wanted to correct. I said, No. not at all. But I know, you have bought a saree for me. And you are a sanyasi. And I will not take a saree from a sanyasi son. So i must get drenched. Otherwise how will I get saree from you? The whole, you see the sweet..completely changed the person. (Inaudible) the tears started rolling his eyes. He said, “Mother, how did you know that I had bought a saree for you?” I said, I know that you have bought a saree for me. And so sweetly went and brought the saree. Just look at that. A little thing. You must learn the tricks of saint things that makes other happy. Giving small little things matter to make others happy. The greatest joy for your Mother is to see you so very happy with each other, enjoying each other. Only after realization you can enjoy others. This you must know. Before that you can not enjoy each other. You see, it is all mental projection. You may say, he is my brother, she is my sister, tomorrow you may murder them. But after realization you really enjoy that person. How? Because the vibrations. Vibrations are the fragrance of a personality. And when you feel, Oh! “What’s that (Inaudible) sometimes a very great soul comes to my feet. And I have seen ten people standing there, they are all taking vibrations from him and they would not allow him to get up. Whenever the poor fellow tries to get up and go they said, no you lye down. Because they are enjoying so much. It’s like that. One must understand that you have such a dimension of love. Which acts, which actualizes, which soothes, which nourishes. I hope all of you will become great trees of love. Abounding love of complete purity and (Cure,may be... INAUDIBLE)  
Next year when I’ll come, I am sure I am going to see that here. May God Bless you all! 
I would like to have questions from you. And I would like to answer. There is no need to be aggressive with me because some people can be very aggressive I have seen. There is no need. I have not come here to take anything away from you. (crowd laughing with Shree Mataji)
Tomorrow I’ll be speaking, I must tell you beforehand about something he spoke to me in the plane about universal consciousness. And he said we should not use the word collective consciousness sometimes people might think we are (INAUDIBLE). We are everything. We are *, we are Christians, we are hindus, muslims, so we are everything. Aren’t we? Because we know all of them are one. So all truths are one. * was a realized soul. Whatever he said, is the truth. We should not brand ourselves or anything. We are everything. So about universal consciousness the word universal consciousness, I’ll explain to you- why at this stage, we can’t use universal consciousness. When you’ll rise to that level, then I will use that word also. Right now, it is only collective consciousness.

Audience:- Can you (INAUDIBLE) 
Sahaja Yogi:- could you speak about reincarnation, in brief? 
Shree Mataji:-  reincarnation of human beings? 
Audience:- Yes! 
Shree Mataji:- what do you want me to speak? 
Sahaja Yogi:- (to the audience) Is there anything in particular that you want to know, whether it happens or it does not happen?
Audience: - (INAUDIBLE) 
Shree Mataji:- No. it is not true because how do you know that it is never said that there is no reincarnation in the Bible. How do you derive that point? It’s never said in the bible that there is no reincarnation. Christ himself said, “I will be coming”. How is it possible without reincarnation? 
Whatever is not said in Bible, how can we assume it being against Christ? (INAUDIBLE) Like you see, if I put on this red mark you see it’s not Christian. Where is it said in the bible that you don’t put on a red thing and can put red on your lips? (Crowd laughing) 
Alright!? So also, I will tell you one thing more that Bible can not contain Christ. He is such a great personality, he abounds everything. You have to go to other scriptures to know what he is otherwise you’ll never understand him. He was allowed only to live for three years. They limited his time so much and whatever he could say, how many understood God alone knows. But they did not even believe him. His own disciples did not even believer him till he was resurrected. Now he is no more so we take him as an authority. But what he was, how he came on this earth, for that you have to go to other scriptures which were written fourteen thousand years back about him. Alright!! (Shree Mataji nodding in an assertive way)
Audience:- (INAUDIBLE) 
Sahajayogi:- we will take one question at a time
Shree Matjai:- so you do not bound to anything. Just keep yourself open. Alright? Thank you! 

Audience:- What is your perception of today’s world situation. 
Shree Mataji:- It could be this way or that way. We can go to hell or we can go to heaven. Both things are very precarious. But as far as sahaja yogis are concerned, you are all going to heaven. No doubt! You are all entering into the Kingdom of God. but I can’t say about the rest of them. Now, see I am coming here after ten years. I came here ten years back. They never liked me. If they had listened to me they wouldn’t be in this mess they are. They would not listen to me and only thing they had tried to teach me is Mother you must ask for money and Rolls Royces. (Crowd laughing) 
Even now, you’ll be surprised there is a newspaper which said how many Rolls Royces does she have?  They said she has none. Then they said, then we are not interested in her. Imagine! They don’t understand God, they don’t understand divinity, they don’t understand. You see,  they are suppose to be Christian nation. I don’t understand what do they know about Christ. How can they talk like this? And there were some in the other church I went to, and they brought Bible to beat me. Atleast respect the church. Respect the Bible if not anything else. You see, so much bound and then they think they are Christians. Christ said, you’ll be calling Christ, Christ, I won’t recognize you. This is a fact. He has talked about the future. He has talked that he’ll send you a comforter. He’ll send you the Holy Ghost. He’ll send you the redeemer and he’ll send you the counselor. What about that? Nobody is bothered. They must show a bony structure of Christ hanging somewhere. He could not have been a bony structure you must understand. That is just your (*ism) that you put him up like that. Only if you see the Sistine Chapel….Man with such exuberance. He was the Christ who could carry the cross. Tell these people to carry the cross anyone of them. Can they? Just talking about Christ doesn’t make you Christians! You must knoe. You have to be born again and you have to be born by the living process of the living God! It’s not just Baptising something. You all must realize. You see in London. You’ll be surprise, the churches are now used as pubs. We must try to see. We shouldn’t hide our faces into something that is unreal. I myself took birth in a Christian family as you know. And in India, most of my followers are hindus. And they ask, “Mother, why did you take birth in a Christian Family?” Muslims and Hindus are my disciples. That too, what do you call aaa….Protestants! So i said that they are the most sophisticated phanatics. Because they rationalize everything. This is the worst part of Christianity. And now they’ll reach a bankrupcy. No rationality about Christ. How will you explain him? I can’t understand. How can you explain Christ with rationality? You can not. He is beyond rationality. He is beyond your mind. You can not conceive him though your mind. Get out of it. You can not understand him, what he was. How will explain that he gave food to so many people. And the Holy Ghost, they don’t want to talk. Holy Ghost is a mystery. They have a father and a son and no mother. Mother is missing. Have you seen such an absurd situation. Can a father produce a son?(Crowd laughing out a loud)  Let me see which father is that. It is absurd. Try to understand, I would like to tell all the people who think that Christ is in their pocket, they are sadly mistaken. Please rise above it. Christ is there no doubt. And he is the gate, no doubt. He stands at the Agya Chakra(Shree Mataji pointing towards the subtle body chart). But try to understand, give him his full value. Give him his full glory. Don’t put him in some books; and some sort of a small corner. He is too great to be contained like this into small things. And that’s what one has to realize. Give up all this fanaticism. Try to see the reality. Otherwise you may be the last to enter into the kingdom of God. Take it from me. The one who came for you, the one who died for you. The one, who did so much for you. You have to do one thing is to crucify all your misidentifications. That’s what you have to do. And come as human beings. Give up all those ideas. Please, save yourself. 

Audience:- I have something to say but there is a question and Here in our country, (INAUDIBLE) to throw away all the belonging, the misidentification. Now, I see people (INAUDIBLE) Kirpal Singh, his disciples at top power and they say different things. And I am open. It’s very good to (INAUDIBLE) wonderful, Thank you. And he says to meditate (UNCLEAR) Christ says in the Bible, This is an argument for me because…. (UNCLEAR)

Shree Mataji:- See, I’ll tell you one thing. You see, the best way to judge a person, first of all. How do you judge a fake guru from a real guru. 

Audience:- Yeah! 

Shree Mataji:- there are many. But one of them is that they never take money from you. How much money has been sent to Mr. Basu. Have you any idea? You have no idea. He has got a big huge domain. You can’t imagine. Now secondly, you must see the people who go to these fake gurus. For example, this one. Most of his disciples suffers from heart attack. Most of them. They die of heart. You go and see. I am telling you, you go and see. I am not afraid because I have cured many of them of their heart troubles. Most of his disciples die of heart attacks. The reason is there is no (UNCLEAR) Minimum of minimum if you have got a right person, you can not get diseases like heart attack, cancer, and all that. A sahaja yogi will never get a cancer, will never get a heart attack. And even if he gets it supposing, he knows how to cure it. If others do not interfere with it he will be alright. Atleast minimum of minimum. If you are still getting sick and all that, you are not living with the truth as yet. The truth shines within you. Minimum of minimum your health should improve. And lifestyle of such a person must be studied. If they want Rolls Royces and comfort and all those things, they are parasites. Because they are living on your money. 

Audience:- Thank you! 

Shree Mataji:- So it’s correct that...Thirdly, and last of all- I will tell you one thing. You must know what you are going to get. It’s alright! I may say, I am this and that..don’t believe me also. What are you going to get. And what you get is not that start jumping on your seats and becoming funny people. Or strange, reclusive. But you become dynamic. Not only that, but you become the master of yourself. Like Yogi has become now a master. He is a master. (Yogi uncle laughing and then everyone laughs including Shree Mataji) So  you all have to become masters. Yeah! So you have to become masters of yourself. Nobody can enslave you anymore. You have to be your own masters. 

Shree Mataji:- Yes my child….

Audience:- (INAUDIBLE)
Yogi Mahajan:- Could you also heal the other parts of the body as you heal the heart?

Shree Mataji:- Yes, yes every part, every part! That’s the minimum. That’s the minimum is to heal yourself. But you can heal others. That’s the minimum of minimum that the physical side that the minimum you can do. It’s true. 

 Audience:- (INAUDIBLE) 

Shree Mataji:- (In hindi) see, they are talking about Muktanand….
 
Yogi Mahajan:- Could you ask something more related to what she is saying.. 

Shree Mataji:- See, related to this, see don’t bring in people. I don’t want to talk about because you go and see what they are. What they are doing. What they have achieved. Now, today we have before you is Yogi Mahajan! He came to me how many years back? Tell them..

Yogi Mahajan:- Five Years. 

Shree Mataji:- Five years. In five years now he can talk on Sahaja yoga, he can achieve it, he can actualize it, he can give you realization. So don’t take the names of these people. I tell you, this parapsychology business. I came to San Diego, and they took directly me to that parapsychology. I am your Mother, I am not going to tell you lie. I am not going to please you. And I told them what are you doing this parapsychology non-sense. You will be in trouble, please don’t it these are all the spirits. But they didn’t like it. They said that Russians are doing it. I said that Russians will also be affected by that. You must understand these are spirits. Don’t do this parapsychology business. Today, I went only two days back to San Diego, the people from that institute came and told me that Mother, we wish we had listened to you. The lady who was running it, her husband got a stroke. She herself is a reclusive (*INAUDIBLE) she is much younger to me in age. So these people, what they have done to you, you should see. Don’t take their names. I don’t want to tell you about them just now but one day I’ll tell you. When you are at that level. 

Audience:- (INAUDIBLE) 

Shree Mataji:- What is he saying? 

Sahaja Yogi:- (whispering slowly) What do you think of homosexuality?

Shree Mataji:- (laughing) will you beat me if I say something? (crowd laughing along) first guarantee that then I’ll tell you. It is not natural my child. Homosexuality is not natural. 
But unnatural things we do in a natural way many a time. The reason is this. Homosexuality, when I came ten years back was not known to people  much. A little bit here and there. The reason it became very very dominant, because firstly, I think, that the women were dominating. They were trying to outbeat men. Moreover, to marry an American woman means you are in for bankruptcy within two to three years. (Crowd laughing out loud) I met a lady in New York. Very rich lady. Came in a big catalogue, this thing, that thing, and said, you will meet my husband in San Diego. Poor fellow was scattered and torn. She had got all this from her first husband, then from the second husband, then from the third husband, and these three husbands met me. They were all in a mess. And they had no money. So they thought that this law is such that if you marry a woman, it’s terrible. You have to share everything that you have. In Australia what share, you have to give everything that you have. This kind of a partiality started. Alright! That’s one of the reason. Secondly, they became very dominant. I must tell you, they lost their feminine power. A woman who is feminine, never dominates. Because she dominates in any case. She is like Mother Earth you see. She knows how to absorb. She knows how to absorb the problems. She knows how to solve the problems. Supposing my husband has any problem, he first comes home. He’ll shout at me, scream at me, finish it off, and then will say now tell me what to do? And I just smile because I know he doesn’t mean any harm to me. It’s just a way that he has to take it out at me. They love that power of femininity. They saw (INAUDIBLE) thought to have men’s power not woman’s power. Because you have seen the women like Kennedy, now look at her. Is she a man or a woman. I don’t know what to call her. I mean, Imagine! And she made such a thing out of her life. Such a thing, it’s something surprising and shocking. For (INAUDIBLE) women we can’t understand, because she was selling her underclothes and people from Australia ran all the way to buy her underclothes. We couldn’t understand, what’s happening to these men and to the women. Men becoming women and women becoming men is horrid stuff. So as it is it was homosexuality. Because they were not of different sexes left. So men took to homosexuality as a matter of convenience. Thirdly, when a person gets possessed by a woman he starts behaving like a woman. In america, we had a boy like that. He used to behave like a woman, he used to dress up like a woman, walk about like a woman and he was a homosexual. In the sense that outwardly, he was living like a man to look at he was man but he was a woman inside. When we removed his possession, he became normal. We have so many homosexuals, who came to us when they get their self realization, they got normal. They are married, they have children. And also women become women after realization. They become beautiful wives and very sweet thing and you like to marry them also.  (Crowd laughing out loud with Mother) 
 
Audience:- I am expecting two children, I would like to know when their spirit enter their body (INAUDIBLE) 

Shree Mataji:- What is she saying?

Yogi Mahajan:- She is going to have two twin children, and she wants to know what happens to the spirit? Is it in her or does it come later on? What happens to the spirit of the children that she is going to give birth to. She is pregnant. 

Shree Mataji:- They are just like normal children. Only thing is that when there are twins, they are born of two different natures. One child will be more right sided another will be left sided. It happens like that. See, it’s a nature’s freek, as you can call it. But there’s nothing wrong with them. They are like any other normal children. There’s nothing abnormal about them. You should be lucky to have two children like that. Its most soothing thing and soothing thing to have children around you. 

Yogi Mahajan:- She is saying, when does the spirit enters the body of the child in the womb. 

Shree Mataji:- As I told you today the whole thing is, that the….it’s a very long process and will take time. 

Yogi Mahajan:- Another time?
         
Shree Mataji:- it’s a long process to explain the zygote and all that. Alright! I’ll explain it to you later. It is about two month’s time that you start feeling the pulsation. That’s the point is. The pulsation that you start feeling in the heart, is the time when spirit really enters. But it’s not enters, I should say, but how should I tell you...I’ll tell you later on. Alright? Yea, yea, I’ll tell you. 

Audience:- My question is, (INAUDIBLE) Kundalini, is it necessary to have a balance between Ida and Pingala nadi? 

Yogi Mahajan:- Is necessary to have a balance between Ida and Pingala channel. The left side and the right side channel?

Shree Mataji:- It is necessary but it works out. Kundalini is such a mother. She works it out for you. See it’s like left and right. (Shree Mataji shows with the moment of her hand gestures) this is the Ida and the Pingala and this is the central path. It is what you call as the sushumna nadi. Now, what happens if you go too much on the right or too much on the left. This breaks. And the connection with the whole also break. This is how become vulnerable to all these diseases you see, which can be triggered later on by something else. But this is very important that you should try to make the centers absolutely, properly, opened out. First they should be like this. Then they should open together like that. So actually when you move on the sides there is an imbalance. But for that you don’t worry, it’s very simple. We will tell you how to do it. 

Yogi Mahajan:- one last question..

Shree Mataji:- alright! 

Audience:- You said that ..Jogging (INAUDIBLE) 

Yogi Mahajan:- he says that he was surprise about jogging that you have no energy left when there is time to run. Where does bicycling fits into this. 

Shree Mataji:- That’s even worse. (Crowd laughing) jogging. I’ll tell you what. In Sahaja yoga terminology we should understand.  When we jog. What do we do? Our attention is on our physical side of life. We are not only physical being. We are physical being, we are mental being, emotional being, spiritual being. If all our attention goes to our physical being, we get into imbalance. Alright! The first thing that will happen to joggers ...I shouldn’t…(pause) will be a heart attack. First thing and in old age they will be absolutely finished. Old age they won’t be able to face. We should use our energy with respect. Never go to extremes for anything. Going to extreme is not good. Cycling you should a little bit, also running you should do a little bit...everything in moderation. Everything should be in moderation. Extreme thing is not good. And even I have seen people who run too much they don’t have any emotional thing. There was one fellow who was a dentist who came to see me, says I have no feelings. I have become a “Stithapragya” I said how? He said, even when my child died I never felt anything. My wife is sick, I never felt anything. Nothing happens to me. I have just become a big “sanyasi”. I said you have become nothing but a hard boiled egg. (Crowd laughing on this) there is no love in your heart. It’s so dry, so dry like a dried fish. You see. You need something in the heart also. He said Mother I really want to do that. Then I told him you stop your jogging and try to remain more on the left hand side. Go and see some nice pictures with your wife. Take her down, see Charlie Chaplin or something and enjoy yourself. And that’s how he is now much better. He is not so bad. 

Shree Mataji:- One more, there is she, she asked…

Yogi Mahajan:- Alright, one more..

Audience:- (UNCLEAR) 

Yogi Mahajan:- She says, what happens when you go into sudden silence which is very sweet does it means that all your chakras are in balance?

Shree Mataji:- Offcourse, it means. Silence should be there and when you feel the silence means that your kundalini has gone above your agya chakra. But there could be another way of getting silence which is a very dangerous thing. Like when you get possessed also you can’t think. So there is a very small line, which one should understand. But if you say you feel very sweet and happy and thoughtless then, its very good. That shows that…

Audience:- (UNCLEAR) 

Yogi Mahajan:- It doesn’t stay very long. 

Shree Mataji:- That will! After the kundalini. See the thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off. In between the thought there is some space. You see, now this space sometimes you reach. If the thoughts are tired, they get elongated and that thing is there. Now this is the present. The central path is the present. When you rise, the kundalini rises she makes this expand. And you are in complete silence. Like me, I am always in silence. 

Audience:- In appreciation, (UNCLEAR) 
(AUM mantra chant for sometime)

Shree Mataji:- Beautiful! Tomorrow I will speak on AUM then if you want me to speak. But, I would say that while saying this, if you put your right hand on your heart. Because it’s the “prana shakti” AUM is right side. “prana shakti” you have to bring in the play of the heart. Because you sing it with your “prana shakti”, singing something with your “prana shakti” with that put your hand on your heart, that your are singing from your heart. It must be sung with the heart. It’s just saying that music or anything, if you say it from your heart, then it is Sahaja. So it should be said from the heart. The bhakti, the devotion, the dedication, is to be expressed through the heart. And without that its all dry. Absolutely dry. Tomorrow I’ll speak to you about OM (AUM). May God Bless you all! 

(Shree Mataji askes another yogi around- shall we do meditation now?)

Yogi:- Shree Mataji will now give vibrations and we’ll tell you how to receive them. As you sit, all of you please extend your hands and take out your shoes so that you are in contact with the Mother Earth. Put the shoes behind you. (Shree Mataji also says that your shoes shouldn’t be in front) 

Shree Mataji:- Now, lets see how we correct our different centers, how we nourish them. Ourselves. Nobody need nourish it, we can nourish ourselves. So you put your left hand straight like this. Now this is the power of desire. You know that. So this is how you desire. So you put your left hand towards me like this, on your lap very comfortably. We should sit very comfortably. There is no need to make any gestures or anything. Just be comfortable and cheerful. Now with the right hand, we do the action. To raise the kundalini, with the right hand. Now I’ll tell you how to do it. First of all, the first thing I have to tell you all, that we are in the present. And we should not feel guilty about anything. So the first thing, you have to tell yourself very clearly that I am not guilty. Even you can tell me in your heart that “Mother, I am not guilty.” just declare it first of all. Absolutely declare that you are not guilty. You are saints. How can saints be guilty. Just give up that habit of sulking that you are guilty. Just give up. You are saints. Remember. Say- I am not guilty. Just say Mother I am not guilty. In your heart, with full confidence you have to say that I am not guilty. Now you have to put the right hand your heart. That’s very important because in the heart resides the spirit. If your heart is not nourished then the Sahastra, this..(Shree Mataji shows her Sahastrara to explain) “Brahmarandra” won’t open out. Because this is the center which is the seat of the heart. This is the seat of the heart. So you must keep your left hand towards me and your right hand on your heart. With respect and love for yourself and for your mother. Just have love and respect. You have to love yourself. You have to respect, you are saints. now , after this you close your eyes slowly. Gradually as I say, these are mantras which you have to say. Now, first of all you have to put your heart into the whole thing and in your heart, ask a question - “Mother, am I the spirit?” ask the question thrice with full confidence. Because you are a computer now and the answer comes to you. Just ask the question- “Mother, am I the spirit?” put me in your heart please, if you can. Mother reside in my heart. Let’s see. That will nourish your heart. Now, you must know that your spirit is your guide and you are your own guru. You are your own master. For this you have to put this right hand just on the left hand side of your stomach to nourish your Guru Principle. Left hand side. At this point, you have to say with full confidence. “Mother- I am my own master. Mother- I am my own guru” say it ten times with full confidence. See the vibrations. Now don’t think of any other gurus. Forget them. You are your own guru, you don’t need any guru. You are a saint. The spirit is going to guide you. Your vibratory awareness is going to guide you. After that saying for ten times, raise your right hand and again back to your heart. Now here, again with love with full confidence without feeling guilty, you have to say- “Mother, I am the spirit” Please say twelve times- “I am the spirit, Mother - I am the spirit.” Full confidence you should have. Now you are nourishing your heart. Now put this right hand on the base of the neck on the left hand side. Please don’t open your eyes till I tell you. At the base of the neck. On the left hand side. This is the Vishudhi chakra on the left hand side. Here you have to say sixteen times - “Mother I am not guilty” and if you have a habit say thirty two times. Or even to punish you more you can say hundred and eight times its horrible just now. I must say it’s the worst center just now to feel guilty. Did I say anything to make you feel guilty. Forget, don’t feel guilty. (Pause) Good! Now, put your right hand across your forehead. At this point you have to say- “Mother I forgive everyone, this is the greatest weapon Christ has given us.” some people might say, it is very difficult. It’s the easiest thing to say. In any case, it is the myth. When you say you do not forgive others what do you do, you are harming yourself nobody else. Just say - “Mother, I forgive everyone.” from your heart very lovingly. (Shree Mataji shaking her right hand and blowing air on the hand.” 
Now put the hand at the back of your head. At the agya at the back. Hold it tight. Now without feeling guilty you have to say- “If you have done any mistake oh Lord! Please forgive us. But without feeling guilty you have to say that. Push back your head and try to hold it fast. And just say that...now put this hand on top of your head. On the fontanelle bone area and press it hard with your hand and move it. Clockwise and press it hard. At this point you have to ask for your “Moksha”  you have to ask for it. I can’t cross your realization. So just you say- “Mother, give us realization, or you can say Mother- Please establish my realization.” you have to ask. I can’t force you. I can not force things on to you. (Shree Mataji rotates her hand on her Sahastrara during these affirmations)I have to respect your freedom. Just go on pressing it like that and say it seven times.      
Now,  (Shree Mataji rubs her palms and dips her right hand into the glass of water that’s on her side table) 
Now raise your left hand on top of your head and put your right hand towards me. Raise it higher, about six inches higher. Like this..(Shree Mataji raises her hand to show and then blows air into the mic a few times) 
Now see, if there is cool breeze coming out of your head. Raise your hands higher. Hmm..better! Just see if there is a cool breeze. Feel it. Move your hands. We want to see if you can feel it with your right hand..(UNCLEAR) move this way. Best way to achieve it would be to raise your own kundalini which I would tell you how to do it. (Shree Mataji asks the yogi around- shall we explain them?) 
Yogi Mahajan:- Sure, we can tell them again. 

Shree Mataji:- It’s very hot. Heart is catching. (*) heart. Alright! Raise your kundalini. (Shree Mataji stands up to explain the method of tying kundalini) 
You bring your left hand in front of your kundalini. Now the right hand, you move it like that. Let’s do it. (*) watching the hand. One bring it up, make your limbs rather loose. Push back your heads. Take it, give it a twist. One (tied the knot) then bring it down. Again. Watch your hand, you can feel it that your kundalini is rising. Now, up. Push back your head, loosen. Give it a big twist. Two (after trying the second knot) now the third one. If you don’t do it, it won’t work out. Your hands have to be loosen. (UNCLEAR) you don’t feel any vibrations. Then push it up, now three knots. One, two, and three. Now check, if there is a cool breeze. (UNCLEAR) better. Now, you push your hands up like that and ask a question in your heart, in your heart. Humble down. Humble down and say- Is this the cool breeze of the holy ghost? Is this the cool breeze of the all pervading living power of God? Feel it? Do you feel it? It is first time, one feels the all pervading power, which is subtle. Which does all the living work. Now, put back your hands. Also you must know how to give yourself a protection before you leave. With the left hand towards me. And the right hand has to be used for giving protection. Let’s start it. One....(Shree Mataji brings her hand back and forth for the bandhan) Two, on the head, three, four, five, six, and seven. Now, nothing can enter your aura. Your spirit is (UNCLEAR) now see the vibrations. 

Shree Matajis asks the yogi in hindi- How many people are coming in the puja tomorrow?

Yogi:- 6-8 sahaja yogis. 

Shree Mataji- Why? Ask everyone. 

Yogi:- really, should we? 

Shree Mataji:- Yea, why not. Whoever has felt it call them….How many of you have felt the cool breeze? Raise your hand higher. Ahh! See.. 

Yogi:- We can tell them informally..

Shree Mataji:- There is another thing we do but this is only done for people who will (* inner self….Unclear)  people who do not even belong. Because you see, truth also is not easy to bear. Christ said- “I am the light, I am the path” which he was, no doubt. But they crucified him. So, I have seen in Sahaja yoga when we start telling them about the truth they sometimes, (revolt*) and we loose some. And they are lost so the thing would be that I’ll leave it to Yogi Mahajan to find out. Who can be taken up for that. Who can not be lost. Because ( UNCLEAR) the ego comes back. So they’ll see about it and then if you are coming to Santa Cruz also we will work it out there. But you can’t go on like this. You have to face it. Because it’s such a deep experience you get after realization. It is very Indian...for Indians to understand what it is. But offcourse the western mind is rather difficult to understand (Unclear) thinking and we don’t want that again that you should again turn back that you did in 1973. So to progress, you have to do something more about it. But that, you do not expose. Very careful. Not in India, in India (UNCLEAR) here because even now, I know people who are still nowhere near. *, egoistical, they did not do any of these things. They didn’t want to feel the cool breeze  (UNCLEAR) So there are people like that. So I will leave him to choose and whatever seems proper you should do it accordingly. But it’s a thing, which if you can somehow or the other manage to be there, its a thing of very great (Unclear) you really go into it. And when I am there, I think you should do it. 

Yogi Mahajan:- I have been put in a very difficult and big event (Maybe*UNCLEAR) and I don’t want to sound discriminating. What we could do is that people who have been attending any of our earlier meetings can join us for a puja ceremony which we would be doing tomorrow. 

Shree Mataji:- you have to do puja to your guru, to your Mother.  

Yogi Mahajan:- yes! 

Shree Mataji:- and it’s a custom in India, you have to do puja to your guru. But actually I have nothing to gain. To be very frank, I (*UNCLEAR) I told him I’ll not have any puja in San Francisco because you see the vibrations start flowing so much so tremendously. The people are not able to receive it, I have to bear it up in my body for sometime and I feel so restless about it. Then I want to just sleep off. I just can’t talk after that. So it is, I have nothing to gain out of that I must tell you that. But you have to gain something out of that happening by which you get your vibrations working out but of course who have not felt the breeze should not come. Should be honest to themselves. Should not come at all. But whatever he says I mean I agree with him. 

Yogi Mahajan:- now the telephone number….

Shree Mataji:- he understands the Americans better than me. Of Course. 

Yogi Mahajan:- our telephone number is in the..
