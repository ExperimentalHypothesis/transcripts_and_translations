1983-0928 Public Program Day 1, The Blessing of Modern Times, San Francisco (USA)

I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

For a mother, the greatest moment is that when she sees her children get all her qualities, all her wealth and all her power. There’s nothing more she wants. I’m so proud of Yogi [Mahajan] that he has so steadily worked it out for so many great souls that have been seeking. As we say that seeking can be very much misleading if you do not know what you are seeking. But you’ll be amazed that those people who are also misled, have done all kinds of mistakes, have gone wrong, have taken to lies which can only be ended. They also, today, are to be saved. And they all can be saved.

God’s love is a bounty, it’s so great that I am, myself, surprised at this operation. The way it has forgiven. The forgiveness is so intense, the love so sweet and delicate and the way it works out, the beautiful connection which you also do not feel how you are connected, it’s such a blessing of these modern times. It was never so easy before and thus I have to just say that you are very fortunate seekers.

Formerly the seekers had to go to the Himalayas to cut themselves off from the whole world, live with very strict gurus who would first beat them nicely to see if they were healthy enough and then they would starve them to see that they lose all their sense of taste. All sorts of tests they were taking to make the guru satisfied. Otherwise he would throw them down.

Today it’s just the other way around. Such gurus of those days never used to beat the disciples. They never tried to see that the disciples are not upset. But today I see how sweetly this power is correcting. One has to understand that these are the days of our last judgement. We are not going to judge by anything else but our Kundalini which is tied to you. It is said in all the scriptures but people do not understand that at the time of judgment you’ll be resurrected also. You are to be resurrected. The one who has created you, the one who has worked so hard, has to be worried about his creation. If He does not worry, who is going to look after it? And that is what I find the anxiety of the Divine, to save all the seekers who are the epitome of evolution. It’s a special category of human beings. You could be anything but a seeker is definitely a special category of people. As William Blake has said, “Men of God (meaning seekers) will become prophets and they will have power to make others prophets.” The blossom time has come and at this time thousands of flowers have to become the fruit, beautifully, not with trouble, not with tears, not with joy, but a complete uplifting and a joyous life thereafter.

So you must know that you are a special category of people. You are the people who are going to lead the whole world ahead. Those who were lost in the mundane things, in the seeking of joy in power, money or other things, you shouldn’t worry about them or should not think that they are absolutely useless. They are going to follow you but first you have to establish yourself, you have to become good sahaja yogis as we call it.

Today, as you know, Sahaja Yoga should be called as Maha Yoga. It is written that when Sahaja Yoga will be done on en masse basis, then it becomes Maha Yoga. It is described so many times in Indian scriptures and by many things and they have been looking forward to this happening en masse. I just witness all the beauty, the bounty, the great technique, the Divine technique, how it works in such a masse scale. As you know, thousands and thousands come to my programs and all of them get realization just like that. It is too fantastic to be believed. It is too true to be believed. But one must know that you are fantastic, you are great. There is something so great in you that you are not even aware of it. But once you become that it works out in such a marvelous way that you are amazed at yourself how you can do it.

Now today’s special request from Yogi was how to sustain our realization? How to keep it going? So let us see what are our real enemies. You should know them, who they are and if you start witnessing yourself now it won’t be a mental projection but whatever you think or whatever you put your attention to, it will act. According to Indian calendar or what we call the panchangas, this is the yuga which is called as kruta yuga. So kali yuga is over, with my birth I think, and now this kruta yuga has started and kruta yuga means where it will act, God’s love will act. This power of Brahma will act. So this is a new dimension into which the all-pervading power of God has started acting. So when you think of something also it acts. So let us see what are our problems and how we get affected and how we get dragged down.

The first and foremost problem we have is the physical one which comes to us sometimes from heredity, sometimes from our birth, sometimes we develop ourselves. So we should know what is the physical problem we have and we should face it. We all can cure our physical problems but certain things people do not understand. Like you go to a big department store, a sahaja yogi especially, and he gets completely drained off. I had taken some of them with me to buy some presents and they all ran out, “Mother, we are going to sit outside. We just can’t sit here. It’s too much.” And they sat on the steps just like small children waiting for me to come out. Nobody wants to help me with things. They said, “Mother, why it happens to me? If I travel, why does my physical energy completely drain out?”

So the thing is that now as you have become the channels of God, the energy is sucked in by other people who are sitting around or those who are in that place or who are working there very hard. It’s perfectly all right because you have chosen to be the channels. But if the channel is completely dragged in the sense that if everything gets exhausted you also feel the drain for the time being. But at that time it’s a very simple technique, a Divine technique which we should remember, that the source of our energy comes from the Spirit which resides in our heart. At this time if you say, “I am the Spirit, I am not this physical being. Why should I be drained out? I am the Spirit.” You can put your hand, if you want, on your Heart or you can [circle] your hand around your Heart like this [bandhan] so that you start bringing your Spirit into your attention and the attention that is dragged outside becomes completely nourished.

One must know that Kundalini is the nourishing thing for you. As soon as you start bringing the Spirit in your attention the Kundalini rises. When She rises, She gives strength to your physical being. You know that these chakras are made out of the elements. The first two chakras are made out of the Mother Earth. So the Mother Earth is a very important thing for us. For such people who feel they are dragged down in their physical energies you must try to sit on the Mother Earth and request Her to give you strength. She’s the one who really now is acting, the kruta, it has started working. So far we have been getting after Her all the time. This is the only element, the Mother Earth, which does not act spontaneously enough. Only the gravity of Her acts and we are gravitated towards Her. But otherwise all of Her other qualities we have to go to Her. We have to dig in and we have to plant something so that something grows and then we have to go to it... You have to put some sort of an effort to get to Her, to use Her energy of nourishment. But She’s the most nourishing thing. She is the one who is nourishment personified. When you sit on Her and you felt Her and if you are a realized soul you’ll find an upsurge of energy coming out. Not only that She comes up to your head and then She takes down all that is not wanted. It’s sort of a cleaning process comes up first of all and then you are filled with energy of Mother Earth.

Now these days you find a craze for jogging. It’s a very common thing. We should run only when it is necessary. It is unnatural to run like this mad, it is not necessary. If we run like this all the time, when the time to run will come you’ll never be able to run. Actually when you run what you do is you fight the frictional force of the Mother Earth. All the time you are hitting Her with your feet, shoes and everything. In a good Indian family the first prayer when you get up in the morning and you have to put your foot on the Mother Earth, you have to say, “Paada
sparasham kshamasva me.” “Mother, please forgive me because I am touching you with my feet.”

When I say this I know some of you may start taking out your shoes and walking on the street. That’s not the point. You must respect your feet first of all and then the Mother Earth. That is very important. Without your feet being looked after, you cannot take the vibrations of the Mother Earth. But the respect for all the elements must be developed. It is not like a primitive respect people had. It is a respect that comes out of enlightenment that you know that all these elements give us nourishment, especially the Mother Earth.

I’ve seen also people trying to extract things from Mother Earth absolutely without any discretion and you know what is the result today. The matter that is extracted is converted into things like plastic, this, that, all useless things. And for this, the poor Mother Earth has been tortured and dug into. Whatever is necessary you must do. That She likes very much because She’s there as a mother. But unnecessarily when we try to torture Her, it’s not being very fair to Her and that is what I feel sometimes we must put attention to the consumption of matter that we do use.

For example, many people now have realized that plastic is not good for the skin, is not good for food, if you eat the food in plastic it can give you trouble and people are quite frightened about the plastic. Now this plastic reacts in us because it is anti-Mother and it acts in a very subtle way within us. It creates a barrier between the Mother Earth and ourselves and this is a very big threat for all of us to understand that we should not try to use plastics very much in our everyday life.

As far as possible try to have few things. Like you can do with one glass for your drinking. But when we went first to London, about ten years back, my husband said, “We have to have people who drink because they won’t come to our house if you don’t have things for them to drink.”

I said, “I’m very novice. I don’t understand. You do what you like.” Poor man, he went to the shop to find out the different tumblers that are to be used and he first had to go through some training. I was amazed that that time he had to pay a thousand pounds to get all kinds of glasses, tumblers – for one thing, one glass, for another thing, another glass. Why can’t they have one glass? It’s a headache. These are the norms we have made by which we have made our lives miserable. There is no need to have so many tumblers in the house. Supposing then you give a particular glass for a particular thing then they say you are not sophisticated. This sophistication has led us to use so many things and variety to such an extent we are using. This is just an ego trip that we want to have so many varieties.

Even we try to have varieties in simple things like motor car handles. If you get into an American car, first find out how it opens. And into the bathroom be careful. I came to San Francisco, I remember first time, I went to a house which was a very posh house in Monterey. I didn’t know what sort of a house it was. The gentleman was I think a bachelor because he’d divorced his wife or was about to divorce his wife, and as soon as I stepped into the bath suddenly I got completely drenched because I put my foot somewhere?...

So the attention is wasted, first of all, in creating variety. You can have variety in color scheme, in wood, in something that is natural. You can have variety to create beauty. But this kind of variety and the amount of time you waste in creating variety is absolutely unforgiven because it leads your attention to madness.

Now French people, for example, you take them to some French cuisine and you will have a nice time with them. Then take one hour discussing what they are going to have, very seriously, as if they are discussing about atomic war. I don’t understand what is there to waste so much energy on such a thing as what you are going to eat. In India we are quite healthy people and whatever is cooked in the house all of us eat. There is no problem of deciding.

This is a trick played by the hoteliers or the restaurant people that we have so many varieties. So they put you into that kind of an ego orientation where you start thinking, “Oh, I can decide what do I want to have.” And you go on worrying about these things. Then he has to make ten types of foods. Some food is consumed, some is not consumed and something is thrown out. Such a waste comes out of this madness is to choose.

If you go and want to buy something, say, a simple thing like a lamp, it’s not easy. they’ll sday now, “What do you want?”

I said, “I want a simple lamp to read.”

“Now this has got the blue of the green of the yellow. That has got the this of the this of the this.”

You say, “I want a simple lamp. Can you give me some lamp which I can use for my reading?”

“Oh, no, you have to decide. You came back? You don’t know which one to buy?”

What to buy? It is too much of choice. You should decide for all your life, once and for all. Like, say, my blouse. This blouse I decided when I was 12 or 13 years of age when I started wearing saris. The style is the same. My tailor knows what my size is. He knows my blouse, how to make it. Finished. Once and for all. No more headaches. So the blouse has to be the same.

But we had some people who were very much Westernized and they would go on cutting the sleeves here and putting the sleeves here and bringing the sleeves here, all the time moving the sleeves up and down and ultimately I found that all were lost in the race because they didn’t know what was the latest going on. All these fashions and all these things are created to make you mad. But a sahaja yogi, he should have his own fashion once and for all and decide “This is my dress, I’m going to wear this, finished.” That’s where men are wiser than women. They just wear their three piece suit, finished. Whether it is hot or cold makes no difference to them. Three piece suit they’ll be moving about and they’ll be having a very nice time.

But not now. Now they have become very active about it and any number of fashions are created. I met a lady in Hong Kong. She was so thin that I thought she was suffering from tuberculosis. But still she was on a diet and I said, “Why are you on a diet?” She told me there was a particular type of a dress she likes. It doesn’t fit her because she is slightly fat. I said, “Are you for the dress or the dress for you? Why should you make your body suffer for that dress which somebody has created?” So the people are playing these games with you just to make money.

Understand this point and sahaja yogis must understand it’s much better that we are not going to be persuaded or to be controlled by anyone like that. We are above that. Nobody can control you. There is no slavery anymore of anything.

So we move further with this, the clothes and things like that, in the food. Now Indians are the worst for this because Indians are very particular as to what they want to eat. They are the worst husbands because we have to keep them pleased. But with other people whatever you give them they are that way much better because their eyes are more developed but not their food habits. So we go on wasting our time on these things and then you say, “We have no time, Mother, for meditation.” How will you have time when you are wasting your time on such and such things. So try to make your demands as less as possible. But that doesn’t mean by any chance that you become a sanyasi. A sanyasi is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga, you know very well, but not to be driven into this madness of what should I buy? This I should buy. That I should buy. Those things where your attention is completely damaged.

The best thing you must know about matter is this, that you can express your love through the matter. Before going to Los Angeles, I was busy shopping for presents to all the people who are there. I really [UNCLEAR evacuated] most of it. Then again in Los Angeles again I went shopping to buy something for the people there. Now I have to go other places and that’s all, I just enjoy that because you can communicate better than anything. You give a little thing, it remains with them. They see, “Oh, Mother has given us.” It’s such a big thing for them. They may have the greatest things of the world, the richest things, but “Mother has given me this one” and they’ve got these things and the vibrations are there.

Now you must know that you are sahaja yogis, that you have got vibrations. You have a new awareness, you are in the fifth dimension, not in the forth but in the fifth dimension. At this stage when you are in the fifth dimension you must understand that you can find out about every matter through your vibrations. So whatever you want to buy you should see the vibrations. You will be attracted to a thing which will be most vibrating and could be the cheapest. Go to any shop because all the rest do not understand vibrations so they go in for something that is not really full with the coefficients to give vibrations. So that would be the cheapest.

The other day I went in order to buy something of silver and I said, “This is the best.” There were sahaja yogis there. They said, “Oh, beautiful, this is so delicate.” She said that these are the cheapest. So you get the cheapest thing, the best thing and the vibrations and what you want to have are available there.

So we need not put our attention too much into this. One person decides that I am going to buy a particular thing, I must have a particular thing. Why? Why do you want to have only a particular thing? You may go to buy a shirt, you might end up with a tie. What’s the harm? You should take from life not in such a way that you fix your attention with obstinacy on anything. If your attention is kept mobile, you go somewhere, this is what is available, it is sufficient. The attitude towards life of all the sahaja yogis should be that, yes, now we have come. If you are late, it’s all right; If you are not late, it’s all right. You are there. You are not lost. As long as you’re not lost then there’s no need to be agitated. Just sit down with yourself because yourself is the Spirit. If you can develop that kind of an attitude, you will be above many things that bother you.

Regarding comfort, we come to the part where we are trying to find out comfort out of this matter. Now be careful on that point for sahaja yogis. The comfort crawls upon you. We have come out of matter. Don’t forget that. We have come out of matter and we have to become the Spirit which is a natural course that has to take place. But because we have come out of matter it’s very easy for us to go back to matter. Anything that is material can always overpower you. For example, a tree is dead. From the dead we make another dead thing, say, a chair. Now if there is a chair, we cannot sit on the ground. The chair becomes our dominating feature. Wherever we go we can get a chair with us because we can’t sit. If you get used to a very comfortable bed then you cannot sleep on the ground. For these things, when they start crawling upon you, you must know that your Spirit is being dominated by matter.

I do not say that you all start sleeping on the ground, no. That’s not the thing. Don’t take to the other extremes. But say, for example, me, you can ask anyone. Some people came to see me in London. I have a really nice house. I have a very nice bathroom and a bedroom, absolutely very nice, no doubt, according to them. But to me it does not matter. When I go to the villages I sleep anywhere. I go for a bath in the river, I have no problem. Nothing can dominate me because I am myself completely regal in my temperament. If you are regal what can lure you? But that does not mean that you go and sleep on the stones. When you become the Spirit automatically it will happen to you that you will not need any kind of a particular comfort nor will you care for it. If you get it, well and good, if you don’t get it, well and good. You are not bothered. You are not going to waste your time on that.

Formerly they used to take the saints into cells, put them there in the caves to make their lives absolutely uncomfortable to train their bodies to be able to bear all kinds of heat and cold. But that is not necessary after realization. Once you are realized there is no need at all to torture your body. Your body automatically takes to that.

Today we haven’t got another great disciple of mine who worked in Australia but when he first came to me, I had a very bad time with him and he had a bad time with me because these days, I told him if you are coming with me it is absolutely spartan, worse than Sparta. So if you are coming with me then be prepared for anything. He said I’m prepared, Mother. I don’t mind. I said all right come along. He and his friend both of them came. And next day in the morning, both of them were furious. They had packed up their things and put them on the rickshaw and they were going away. I said, “What happened?”

“I slept on the cement.”

“Really? I’m sorry for that.”

“But how it happened, there were only two mattresses and three persons. I had to sleep on the cement.”

The other person said, “I slept on the cement.”

They were very angry. So they went to the market and bought two big mattresses, thick ones like that, carried them on their heads and all the Indians started laughing because it’s not done in India to carry mattresses on the head. And then they were even more furious. “These stupid people don’t understand anything, we are so uncomfortable.” And they brought those two mattresses there.

I said, “All right, will you be carrying these mattresses with you?”

They said, “Yes,” and they carried them along to Delhi but somehow they lost them again. Now it was too much for them to believe that they had lost the mattresses on which they could sleep.

I said, “Are you going to carry your mattresses in the Kingdom of God?” And that made them think. In the Kingdom of God, the comfort comes from your Spirit. If your Spirit is comfortable, you are comfortable. If your Spirit is not comfortable, you are not comfortable. And how the Spirit gets uncomfortable, that we should try to see by understanding what makes the Spirit happy.

Say there is the music which comes from matter. When you see the thing was played, it was made of matter. But when you play it, the beauty of that resonance creates such a beautiful aura. In the same way we must use our Spirit to play upon the matter to create beauty and not to make ourselves ugly and slaves of the matter. The Spirit has to work out in this way within every Sahaja Yogi and once you know how to work it out you become such a free person. You are not bothered as to how you travel, as to what you do, where you are. You are in complete peace and harmony with yourself. Otherwise, it is a headache. You have to ensure it, you have to do this, you have to do that. If matter means headache, better to not have it. But if it means joy then it’s all right because that is the quality of the Spirit, to relate to you form matter to itself.

Just see now. People used to say Spirit is not matter. That’s true. But matter is the one that contains the Spirit. Supposing you are souls in the sense you are dead souls. I cannot give you Realization at all. You have to be a living personality. You have to be in this matter, in this body. Only then Realization can work out. I, we cannot give to the people who are dead Realization, we cannot. So, matter is in a way important and the purity of matter that we have to achieve within ourselves. And that we can achieve through various methods of, first of all, the cleansing of our being, properly. Even when we think about bad things and harming others and injuring others, we need not use weapons, but we use our tongues. Then we are hurting them with the matter, that’s the tongue. This tongue is to be used for saying something that is soothing, nourishing. And also, it can be used for cleansing but you must reach that state of sweetness and that state of glory from where if you speak about cleansing, people accept it slowly and the whole thing works out its own way.

This is what is very important because you know the West has become more growth outside like a tree, the more material development has come now. You see that very clearly, though you are now fed up with it. But it has grown, it has grown so big and you cannot just run away from it.

Like some people said that: "We dress up like this, like a primitive person because we want to become primitive." But you cannot because your brain is modern. How can you be primitive? Just by changing dress or anything you cannot become primitive. You cannot get the peace of a primitive mind.
So what you have to do is to make this modern brain absolutely adjusted to your Spirit and you will be amazed. After some time, when this torrential attack of your thoughts subsides, then you feel your peace within yourself and that peace gives you enjoyment of matter also in a very different way.

Like Mona Lisa’s painting or the Sistine Chapel if you have seen. Just go there and you look at it and you just don’t think because it makes you thoughtless. To sahaja yogis it gives vibrations and you just watch it without thought. To watch something without thought is the gift of sahaja yogis because when you watch something, say, I watch this piece, then I start thinking: "How much it must have cost, I hope it doesn’t get spoiled if Mother sits there or something goes wrong with it." So, these ideas start crawling into your head and the whole joy of its creation, the love with which it is put and all that it's all finished. So, at that time, if you can see the thing without thinking, it’s a very big thing, we do not realize that the computer, which has developed alongside our evolution, cannot produce a human mind even which it is not Realized because we just see it up without thinking. If you are here I am just seeing you. I need not think at all, I can see you.

But when you are a Realized soul then you see a thing and you just don’t think at all about it and the joy of its creation starts pouring on you. Now then you go further with it as it is said in the Bible, that: “Whatever was created by the Mother Earth should not be reproduced and should not be worshipped.” So what does that mean? That the Mother Earth has created something. Now, what has Mother Earth created? We do not know if Mother Earth has created anything which cannot be reproduced. But after Realization, you will see that at a different point you suddenly start getting vibrations.
Like your Stonehenge, I would say. In England, I discovered that Stonehenge is one of them. This whole thing came out of the Mother Earth giving vibrations but people did not know what it was and they cut it and made some circles and things like that out of it. But actually, the whole thing has come out of the Mother Earth which is giving vibrations.
Now, a Realized soul, when he makes something like a statue, made, say, I’ve seen in Notre Dame, I would say the Notre Dame statue of Mother Mary gives tremendous vibrations. No doubt about it, it gives tremendous vibrations. But maybe the reproduction of that will not give [vibrations]. So after Realization, you start understanding that the form of the Formless starts giving vibrations if it is done by a Realized soul if it is supported by a Realized soul to such an extent that supposing now I am here and I touch something. If it is a sensitive Sahaja Yogi, he can feel it that Mother has touched it because there are vibrations left permanently, eternally.

I’ll give you an example. I went to Kashmir once and we were going to a very lonely place.
Suddenly I said, “What is this place?”
The driver said, “No, it’s all wilderness.”
And I said, “No, there must be a temple or something.”
And he said, “It is all wilderness, there’s nothing here.”
I told my husband, “No, I can feel tremendous vibrations in the area. Let us follow the vibrations.” So we went along a little, smaller road and there we saw some Muslims living there.
So we asked them, “Is there any religious place here?”
He said, “Yes, this is called as Hazrat Iqbal.”
That is, one hair of Mohammed Sahab was kept in that point and I caught it about 5 - 6 miles away from that place. One hair of Mohammed Sahab, one nail of Lord Buddha. That dress of Jesus Christ. How you will make out? Because of vibrations. With vibrations, you will know He’s the King. There are all controversies can be resolved about whether it belonged to Christ or not. Everything can be explained whether it was the hair of Mohammed Sahab or not on vibrations. If it has vibrations it is true.

So many things this Mother Earth has done for us. She emits vibrations for our well being, to keep the atmosphere clean. She is the one who emits innocence and that innocence definitely looks after our well being. It tries to guide us in proper ways.

There’s another example: I went to a very small place, Musalwadi, in Maharashtra and they told me that they wanted to make a retaining wall for the water that was accumulated and they called it as a big lake. So that lake was to be given a bund [dam] to be built there. About 60 or 70 years back an English engineer tried to build it. But at a point about 30 or 40 feet area he just could not do it. Whatever he tried to do that the whole thing used to just fall off. The day time they would build, the next morning they would see the whole thing has fallen off. He has written it down in his letter that I did not understand what it was. Then a saint came in and he said that this is a vibrated place and you cannot build here. So the thing was built in a round way. If you go there, if you are a realized soul, you will find a tremendous cool breeze coming out. Even if it is the hottest day you’ll find an air conditioner working, but only the sahaja yogis can feel it. That’s the main point. Not the others, they cannot feel it. But you can feel the air conditioner working there of this Mother Earth who is looking after us. She’s done so many things for us and in the Patanjali Yoga, Her blessings are called as Ritambhara Pragya which is a very important thing we have to understand. That when the Spirit starts shining in our attention and the Mother knows about it, then She fills us with Ritambhara Pragya. This Ritambhara Pragya can be translated like this. Ritambhara also means the seed. The Mother changes the seed and this Mother Earth chooses Her seasons and changes Her seasons. That means She fills this universe with the beauty of the seasons when the knowledge of that becomes pragya – gya is the knowledge, pra means enlightened – becomes enlightened, then you start seeing how beautifully She guides, how beautifully She bathes, how beautifully She nourishes.

Once I went down to Kuala Lumpur. I was alone, no other sahaja yogis, and all the kinds of diseases walked in to me there. They said we have to be cured. There were about a thousand people in that garden and I didn’t know what to do. Then I just asked the Mother Earth, I said, “Now you’d better help me.” All of them I asked them to sit down. They were mostly Indians, they all sat down on the ground. Most of them got cured. It was published in the newspaper that it was an amazing thing that happened. But the best was a little boy of 12 years who was brought by the parents because he had polio, he couldn’t even walk. He was sitting there and they said, “Where has he gone?” He had just got up and walked off.

This Mother Earth is such a big thing, we have no idea and Her consciousness that we now have to know is Kundalini. Kundalini represents the Mother Earth within you, the feminine qualities. We talk of feminists, now that feminism is something absurd, to become man to the woman, woman to the man. It’s all pendulum-like movement and you know whatever moves in a pendulum is not progressing. You have to move in a spiral. I hope you understand about the peptones. If they become linear they get destroyed, all their identity is lost. But if they retain their spiral nature, then they progress. In the same way we, too, have to go in our consciousness in a spiral way and jump higher than what we are. That’s only possible with a spring of Kundalini which is nothing but a representation of Mother Earth within us. She’s the Mother Earth.

So now what do we have to become? We have done all these aggression and competition and then all kinds of things. We have grown so big. Now we have to go to our roots. We have to get that force which nourishes us. That is the Kundalini which is also Kumbha in Sanskrit language meaning Aquarius. That’s why it is called as the Age of Aquarius. Aquarius is the Kundalini and this Aquarius is going to nourish us, soothe us and take us to that place where resides God’s place, is the Spirit. She’s the one who gives us this union of yoga.

One has to understand this pendulum movement is just a mental projection. If you move into one direction then you can move into another direction. It’s all linear. If you see, all your enterprises are linear. That’s why they move this side your political thing. You move like that, it recoils back. You don’t understand what we have done wrong. Then you go the other way round, it again recoils back. You try to develop your science, it becomes atomic bombs there. Anything you try to develop it becomes a devil. You can’t understand why these were moving properly, why it becomes a devil that starts attacking us back, why it is trying to destroy us. The reason is the movement is linear. You have to move spirally higher with your consciousness as a state where you become a compassionate, loving, nourishing, soothing personality.

This country has produced a very great man, Abraham Lincoln. I used to adore him from my childhood and this man has brought such great qualities. In you, all of you, lies that trick of Abraham Lincoln and then the sahaja yogis will rise as a great realized soul. I’m sure you all will be achieving that fulfillment, that nourishing quality, that soothing quality and also that Divine Love which is so pure, without any lust or greed. That’s what you all are going to exhibit and it is going to act. That’s the part we should know after realization. Now it is going to act automatically. Whether you like it or not it will act and you’ll be amazed how things will work out. So just be on the lookout for all these beautiful experiences.

May God bless you. Tomorrow again, I’ll tell you about other things and other chakras. I hope I have been able to tell you how to sustain it by understanding that you have to develop qualities of soothing, of compassion, of love, of sweetness that you can develop by watching yourself.

There was a guru who was a realized soul and a very evolved personality and he lived in a cave up in the mountains. I wanted to go and see him. So all the sahaja yogis said, “Mother, you never like a guru.”

I said, “No, when did I say that? I don’t like agurus who are not gurus. He’s a great man and I must go and see him. He is my son. He’s only 108 years of age.”

So they said, “Mother, how could you do it?”

I said, “I’ll do it. Don’t you worry about me. I’m going to climb up.” So I said, “You see the vibrations. Before asking me questions, see the vibrations.” And the vibrations started coming.

This gentleman, poor man, he didn’t come to America. But still his hands and legs were broken only in India and he was absolutely useless to do any good work because he thought he cannot even walk. But he has a tiger on which he sort of moves about and he lives in a cave. So when I went up, he also has a great power to control the elements as far as the rain is concerned.

When I went up it started raining very heavy and he got very angry and he said, “What is this rain? Why is it like this?” When I went up he wouldn’t look at me. He was sitting on a stone seat [shaking his head back and forth] and he wouldn’t look at me. When I went up I sat nicely. He had made nicely a place for me and everything. I sat down and then he came up to me. He said, “Why did you keep the rain like that? I cannot even give you a clear day when you are coming to see me, that’s my Mother, after so many days...” and all those things he said to me.

I said, “See now, don’t be angry with the rain.”

He said, “It must be my ego you wanted to correct.”

I said, “No, not at all. But I know you have got a sari for me and you are a sanyasi and I will not take a sari from a sanyasi son. So I must get drenched. Otherwise how can I take a sari from you?”

The whole, the sweet... completely changed him. The tears started rolling. He said, “Mother, how did you know I had bought a sari for you?”

I said, “I know you had bought a sari for me.” And so sweetly he went and brought the sari for me. Just look at that, a little thing.

You must learn the tricks of saying things that makes others happy. Giving small little things, matter to make others happy. The greatest joy for your Mother is to see you all so very happy with each other, enjoying each other. Only after realization you can enjoy others, this you must know. Before that you cannot enjoy each other. It’s all mental projection. You may say, “He’s my brother,” or “She’s my sister.” Tomorrow you may murder. But after realization you really enjoy that person. How? Because the vibrations are the fragrance of the personality. And then you feel, “Oh, what life.”

Sometimes a very great soul comes to my feet and I have seen ten people standing there. They are all taking vibrations from him and they would not allow him to get up. Whenever the poor fellow tries to get up, they said, “No, lie down there,” because they are enjoying it so much. One must understand that you have such a dimension of love which acts, which actualizes, which soothes and nourishes. I hope all of you become great trees of love, of bounding love, of complete purity and joy. Next year when I come I’m sure I’m going to see that here. May God bless you all.

I would like to have questions from you and I would like to answer. There is no need to be aggressive with me because some people can be very aggressive, I’ve seen. There’s no need because I’ve not come here to take away anything from you.

Tomorrow I’ll be speaking, I must tell you beforehand, about something he spoke to me in the plane about universal consciousness and he said that we should not use the word collective consciousness. Sometimes people might think us to be Jungian. We are Jungian, we are Christians, we are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are everything aren’t we? Because we know all of them are one. So all truths are one. Jung was a realized soul so whatever he said is the truth. We should not brand ourselves or anything, we are everything. So about universal consciousness, the word universal consciousness, I will explain to you why at this stage we cannot use universal consciousness word. When you rise to that level, then I will use that also. Just now it is only collective consciousness.

Seeker: Could you speak about reincarnation of human beings?

Shri Mataji: What do you want me to speak?

Yogi (to the seeker): Is there anything in particular that you want to know, whether it happens or does not happen?

Seeker: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: No, it is not true because how do you say it is never said that there is no reincarnation in the Bible? How do you derive that point? It is never said in the Bible that there is no reincarnation. Christ Himself has said, “I will be coming.” How is that possible without reincarnation? Whatever is not said in the Bible, how can we assume it as being against Christ. It’s not said, nowhere, that you are not incarnated. Like you see if I put on this red mark. They say it is not Christian. Where is it said in the Bible that you don’t put on a red thing and you can put it on the lips? Also I will tell you one thing more, that the Bible cannot contain Christ. He’s such a great personality. He’s above everything. You have to work with other scriptures to know what He is. Otherwise you’ll never understand Him. He was allowed only to live for three years. They limited His time so much and whatever He could say, how many understood, God only knows. But they did not even believe Him. His own disciples did not believe Him till He was resurrected. Now He is no more so we take Him as an authority. But what He was, how He came on this Earth, for that you have to go to other scriptures which were written about 14,000 years back about Him. So do not bow to anything. Just keep yourself open.

Seeker: Mataji, what is your perception of the present world situation?

Shri Mataji: It could be this way or that way. We can go to hell or we can go to heaven. Both things are very precarious. But as for sahaja yogis are concerned, you are all going to heaven, no doubt. You are all going to enter into the Kingdom of God. But I can’t say about the rest of them. I’m coming here after ten years. They never liked me. If they had listened to me they would not be having this mess that they are. They would not listen to me and the only thing they tried to teach me is, “Mother, you must ask for money and Rolls Royces.” Even now, you’d be surprised there’s a newspaper, they said, “How many Rolls Royces does she have?”

They said, “She has none.”

Then they said, “We are not interested in her.”

They don’t understand God, they don’t understand divinity. They are supposed to be a Christian nation. I don’t understand what could they know about Christ? How could they talk like this? And there were some in the other church where I went, they brought the Bible to beat me. At least respect the church, respect the Bible if not anything else. This is so much bound and they think they are great Christians. Christ has said,  “You’ll be calling Me ‘Christ, Christ,’ I won’t recognize you.” This is a fact.

He’s talked about the future. He’s talked that He’ll send you a comforter, He’ll send you the Holy Ghost, He’ll send you the redeemer, and He’ll send you the counselor. What about that? Nobody’s bothered. They must show a bony statue of Christ hanging somewhere. He could not have been a bony structure you must understand. That’s just your [UNCLEAR ___ism] that you put Him up like that. Only if you see the Sistine Chapel and oh [UNCLEAR] Man, such exuberance. He was the Christ that could carry the cross. Can these people carry the cross, any one of them, can they? Just talking about Christ doesn’t make you Christian. You are to be born again and you are to be born by the living process of the living God. It’s not just baptizing something, you all must realize. In London you’ll be surprised the churches are now used as pubs. We must try to see? We should not hide our faces into something that is unreal.

I, myself, took birth in a Christian family, as you know. In India most of my followers are Hindus and they ask me, “Mother, why did you take birth in a Christian family?” Muslims and Hindus are my disciples, that, too, and Protestants. So I said that they are the most sophisticated fanatics, because they rationalize everything. This is the worst part of Christianity. And now they’ll reach a bankruptcy. There’s no rationality about Christ. How will you explain Christ with rationality? You cannot. He’s beyond rationality. He’s beyond your mind. You cannot conceive of Him through your mind. Get out of it. You cannot understand Him, what He was. How will you explain that He gave food to so many people? And the Holy Ghost they don’t want to talk. Holy Ghost is a mystery. They have a Father and a Son and no Mother. Mother is missing. Can you see such an absurd situation? Can a father produce a son? Let me see which father can produce. It is absurd. Try to understand. I’d like to tell all the people who think Christ is in their pockets, they are sadly mistaken. Please write about it. Christ is there and He’s the gate, no doubt. He stands at the Agnya Chakra. But try to understand. Give Him His full value, His full glory. Don’t put Him in some books, and some sort of a small corner. He is too great to be contained like this into small things. And that’s what one has to realize. Give up all these fanatics. Try to see the reality. Otherwise you may be the last to enter into the Kingdom of God. The one who came for you, the one who died for you, the one He did so much for you. You have to do one thing is to crucify all your misidentifications and come as human beings. Give up all those ideas. Please, save yourselves.

Seeker: I have something to say but it’s a question. Here in our country I’ve worked a long time to throw away all the belongings, all the misidentifications. Now I see people like you, well, not like you, but Kirpal Singh and his disciple Kakar and they say different things and I am hoping –  It’s very good to meet you, it’s wonderful, thank you –  and he says to meditate at the third eye. Christ says in the Bible... Now, this isn’t an argument from me...

Shri Mataji: I’ll tell you one thing. You see, the best way to judge a person, first of all – how do you judge a fake guru from a real one? There are many, but one of them is they never take money from you. How much money is sent to Mr. Basu? Do you have any idea? You have no idea. He has got a huge domain. You can’t imagine.

Secondly you must see the people who go to these fake gurus. For example, this one. Most of his disciples suffer from heart attack. You go and see. I’m not afraid because I’ve cured many of them of their heart troubles. The reason is there is no [UNCLEAR Spirit?]. Minimum of minimum, if you have got a right person you cannot get diseases like heart attack, cancer and all that.

Thirdly, a yogi will never will get a cancer, never get a heart attack. Even if he gets sick, supposing, he knows how to cure. If others do not interfere with it, he will be all right, at least, minimum of minimum. If you are still getting sick, know that you are not living with the Truth as yet. When the Truth shines within you, minimum of minimum his health should be good and the lifestyle of such a person must be studied. If they want Rolls Royces and comforts and all those things, they are parasites because they are living on your money.

Last of all, you must know what you are going to get. It’s all right. I may say I’m this and that. Don’t believe me also. What are you going to get out of it and what you get is not that you start jumping on your seats or becoming funny people or strange recluses, but you become dynamic.Not only that, but you become the master of yourself. Like Yogi, he has become now a master. You all have to become masters. Yeah, you have to become masters of yourselves. Nobody can enslave you anymore. You have to be your own master.

Yes, my child?

Seeker: Could you also heal other parts of the body as you protect the heart?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, every part. That’s the minimum is to heal yourself. But you can also heal others. It’s true.

Seeker: [asking Mother to comment on different gurus]

Shri Mataji: Now, this is another. I don’t want to talk about these Muktananda bhaktas. Related to this, don’t bring in people because you go and see what they are, what they are doing, what they have achieved. Today you have here before you Yogi Mahajan. You came to me how many years back?

Yogi Mahajan: Five years.

In five years now he can talk on Sahaja Yoga, he can achieve it, he can actualize it, he can give realization. So don’t take the names of these people. This parapsychology business... I came to San Diego and they took me directly to that parapsychology institute. I’m your Mother. I’m not going to tell you lies, I’m not going to please you, and I told them, “What are you doing this parapsychology nonsense. You will be in trouble. Please don’t do it. These are all the spirits.”

But they didn’t like it. They said, “The Russians are doing it.”

I said, “Russians, also, could be affected by that. You must understand these are spirits. Don’t do  parapsychology.” Two days back I was in San Diego. The people for that institute came and told me we wish we had listened to you. The lady who was running it, her husband got a stroke. She, herself, is a recluse now. She cannot face life. She’s much younger to me in age. So these people, what they have done to you, you should see. Don’t take their names. I don’t want to tell you abou them just now but one day I’ll tell you when you are at that level.

Seeker: What do you think of homosexuality?

Shri Mataji: Will you beat me if I say something? First guarantee that, then I’ll tell you. It is not natural, my child. Homosexuality is not natural. But unnatural things we do in a natural way many a times. The reason is this: Homosexuality, when I came ten years back, was not known to people much. A little bit here and there. The reason it became very dominant is because firstly, I personally think, the women were dominating, they were trying to out beat them. Moreover to marry an American woman means you are in for bankruptcy.

I met a lady in New York, a very rich lady, who came in a big Cadillac and she said, “You’ll meet my husband in San Diego.” The poor fellow was tattered and torn. She had got all this from her first husband, then taken from second husband, then from third husband. These three husbands met me and they were all in a mess and they had no money. They had this law if you marry a woman, it’s terrible, you have to share everything that you have. In Australia, not share, you have to give away everything that you have. This kind of a partiality started. That’s one of the reasons.

Secondly they became very dominating. They’ve lost their feminine powers. A woman who has feminine power never dominates you because she dominates in any case. She’s like the Mother Earth. She knows how to absorb the problems, she knows how to solve the problems. Supposing my husband has any problem. He first comes home, he shouts at me, screams at me, finished now. And then he tells me, “Now, what to do?” And I just smile because I know he doesn’t mean any harm to me. It’s just the way he has to take it out on me.

They’ve lost their power of femininity. So the men thought it’s better to have man’s power, not to have a woman’s power. Because we have seen the women like Mrs. Kennedy, now, look at her. Is she a man or a woman? I don’t know what to call her. She made such a thing out of her life, something surprising and shocking. For us Indian women we can’t understand because she was selling her underclothes and people from Australia ran all the way to buy her underclothes. We couldn’t understand what is happening to the men and to the women, the men becoming women and women becoming men. It was a horrid stuff. As it is it was homosexuality because they were not of different sexes left. So men took to homosexuality as a matter of convenience.

Thirdly when a man gets possessed by a woman he starts behaving like a woman. In America we had a boy like that. He used to behave like a woman, dress up like a woman, walk about like a woman and he was a homosexual in the sense that outwardly he was living like a man, looking like a man, but he was a woman inside. When we removed his possession he became normal. We have so many homosexuals who came to us. When they got realization now act normal. They are married and have children and also women become women after realization. They become beautiful wives and very sweet things and you like to marry them also.

Seeker: I’m expecting two twin children and I would like to know when does their Spirit enter their bodies? Are they born with it or does it come later on?

Shri Mataji: That’s just like normal children. Only thing is that when there are twins they are born of two different natures. One child will be more right-sided and the other will be more left-sided. It happens like that. It’s the nature’s freak as you can call it. But there is nothing wrong with them, there is nothing abnormal about it, You should be lucky to have two children like that. It’s as most soothing thing and relaxing to have children around.

Seeker: When does the Spirit enter the body of the child in the womb?

Shri Mataji: As I told you today, it’s a very long process and it will take time to explain the zygote and all that. I’ll explain to you later. It’s about at two month’s time that you start feeling the pulsation of the heart. That’s the time the Spirit freely enters. But it’s not “enters,” I should say, but...  I’ll tell you later on.

Seeker: Is it necessary to have a balance between the Ida and Pingala for the Kundalini to rise?

Shri Mataji: It is necessary, but Kundalini is such a Mother. She works it out for you. the left and right,  is the Ida and Pingala and the central path is the Sushumna Nadi. If you go too much onto the right or the left, this breaks and the connection with the whole is also broken. This is how you become vulnerable to all these diseases. It can be cured later on by something else. But this is very important that you should try to make the center properly opened out and then they should open together like that. Actually if you move on the sides it’s an imbalance. But for that you don’t worry, we’ll tell you how to do it. It’s very simple.

Seeker: I was surprised when you said jogging is not a good activity and there would be no energy left to run when you needed to. Where does the bicycle fit into that?

Shri Mataji: That’s even worse. I’ll tell you what. In Sahaja Yoga language, when we jog, what do we do? Our attention is on the physical side of life. We are not only physical beings. We are physical beings, mental beings, emotional beings, spiritual beings. If all our attention goes to our physical beings we get into imbalance. The first thing that will happen in jogging will be heart attack and in old age they will be absolutely finished. Old age they won’t be able to face. We should use our energy with respect. Going to extremes is not good.  Cycling you should do a little bit, also running you should do a little bit. Everything in moderation. Even I’ve seen people who run too much. They don’t have any emotional being. There was one fellow, a dentist who came to see me and he said, “I have no feelings, I’m a sthita pragya [person who is in witness state unperturbed by desires].

Shri Mataji: I said, “How?”

He said, “Even when my child died, I never felt anything. My wife is sick, I never felt anything. Nothing happens to me. I’ve just become a big sanyasi.”

I said, “You’ve become nothing but a hard-boiled egg. There is nothing, your heart is so dry, like a dried fish. You need something in the Heart also.”

He said, “Mother, I really want to do that.”

I told him to stop your jogging and try to remain more on the left-hand side, go and see some nice pictures with your wife, take her around, see Charlie Chaplin or something and enjoy yourselves. And that’s how now he’s much better. He’s not so bad.

Seeker: What happened when you go into a sudden silence where you go into a void which is very sweet, does it mean that all your chakras are in balance?

Shri Mataji: Of course it means, silence should be there and when you feel the silence the Kundalini has gone beyond the Agnya Chakra. But there could be another way of getting silence which is a very dangerous thing like when you get possessed also. You can’t think. So there is a very small line one should understand. But if you say you feel very sweet and happy and thoughtless, then that’s very good.

Seeker: It doesn’t stay very long.

Shri Mataji: That will after the Kundalini... The thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off. In between the thoughts there is some space. This space sometimes you reach and the thoughts are tired, they get elongated and that thing is there. This is the present. The central part is the present and when the Kundalini rises, She makes this space expand and you are in complete silence and, like me, I am always in silence...

[Seekers and yogis start singing Om for some time.]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Tomorrow I’ll speak on Om then if you want me to speak. But I would say by saying this that you should put your right hand on your Heart because it’s the prana shakti. Om is the right side, the prana shakti. To bring in the play of the Heart because you are saying it with your prana shakti. With that you put your hand on your Heart, that you are singing from your Heart. This must be sung with the Heart. It’s just saying music or anything, if you say it from your Heart, then it is Sahaj. But it should be said from the Heart, with bhakti, the devotion, the dedication, through the Heart. Without that it’s all dry. Tomorrow I’ll speak to you about Om. May God bless you.

Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji will now give vibrations and will tell you how to receive them. As you sit all of you please turn your hands and take out your shoes and put them behind you.

Shri Mataji: Now let us see how we correct our different centers, how we nourish them ourselves. Nobody needs to nourish it. We can nourish ourselves. So you put your left hand straight like this. This is the power of desire. This is how we desire. So you put the left hand towards me like this on your lap very comfortably. You should sit very comfortably. There is no need to make any gestures or anything, just be comfortable and cheerful. With the right hand we do the action to raise the Kundalini. I will tell you how to do it. First thing is that we are in the present and we should not feel guilty about anything. So the first thing you have to tell yourself that I am not guilty. Even if you tell me in your heart, “Mother, I am not guilty,” declare it, first of all. You are saints. How can saints be guilty? Just give up the habit of getting into the sulking that you are guilty. Just give up. You are saints, remember. Just say, “Mother, I am not guilty.” From your Heart, with full confidence, you have to say I am not guilty.

Now you have to put the right hand on your Heart. That’s very important because in the Heart resides the Spirit. If your Heart is not being nourished, then the Sahasrara, this Brahmarandra, won’t open out, because this is the center which is the seat of the Heart. So you must keep your left hand towards me and right hand on your Heart with respect and love for yourself and for your Mother. Just have respect and love. You have to love yourself, you have to respect. You are saints. After this you close your eyes, slowly, gradually as I say, is a mantra which you have to say. Now first of all you put your Heart into the whole thing and in your Heart you ask the question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask the question thrice with full confidence because you are a computer now and the answer comes to you. Just ask the question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Put me in your Heart, if you can. Just say, “Mother, reside in my Heart.” That will nourish your Heart.

You must know that your Spirit is your guide, that you are your own guru, you are your own master. For this you have to put this right hand just on the left-hand side of your stomach to nourish your guru principle. At this point you have to say, with full confidence, “Mother, I am my own master.” “Mother, I am my own guru.” “Mother I am my own guide.” Say it ten times. with full confidence. Don’t think of any other gurus. Forget them. You are your own guru. You don’t need any other gurus. You are a saint. Your Spirit is going to guide you, your vibratory awareness is going to guide you.

After saying that for ten times, raise your right hand again back to your Heart. Here, again with love, with full confidence, without feeling guilty, you have to say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.” Please say it twelve times. I am the Spirit. I am nourishing your Heart.

Now put this right hand on to the base of the neck on the left-hand side. Please don’t open your eyes till I tell you. This is the Vishuddhi Chakra, on the left-hand side. Here, you have to say 16 times, “Mother, I am not guilty.” If you have this habit you have to say 32 times. Even to punish you more, you can say 108 times. It’s horrible just now. It’s the worst center just now is to feel guilty. If I say anything to make you fee guilty forget it, forget it. Don’t feel guilty. Good.

Now put your right hand across your forehead. At this point you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us. Some people might say it’s very difficult. It’s the easiest thing to say. In any case it is a myth when you say you do not forgive others, what do you do? You are harming yourself, nobody else. Just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” From your Heart, very lovingly.

Now put your hand at the back of your head, at the Agnya at the back. Hold it tight. Without feeling guilty you have to say, “If I have done any mistakes, O Lord, please forgive me.” Without feeling guilty you have to say that. Push back your head and try to hold it fast and just say that.

Now put this hand on the top of your head on the fontanel bone area and press it hard and move it, clockwise. Press it hard. At this point you have to ask for your moksha, You have to ask for it. I cannot cross your realization. Just you say, “Mother, give me realization.” Or you can say, “Mother, please establish my realization.” You have to ask. I cannot force you. I cannot force things on you. I have to respect your freedom. Just go on pressing it like that and say it seven times. Now raise your left hand on top of your head and put your right hand towards me. Put it higher, about six inches high, like this. [Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.] Now see if there is cool breeze coming out of your head. Raise your hand. Better. Just see if there is cool breeze. Move your hand. Go on to see it now with the right hand.

Best way to achieve it is to raise your own Kundalini which I will tell you how to do it. Raise your Kundalini. You put your left hand in front of your Kundalini, like this. Now the right hand. You move it like that. Let’s do it. Watching the hand, bring it up. Now make your hands rather loose, push back your head, give it a twist, “one,” then bring it down. Again, watch your hand. You can feel it that your Kundalini is rising. Now push back your head. Loosen it. Give it a big twist, “two.” Now the third one, just try. If you don’t do it, it won’t work out. Your hands have to be looser. Otherwise you don’t feel any vibrations. Just push it up. Now, three knots – “one,” “two” and “three.”

Now, you push your hands up like that [reaching straight up, palms facing upward] and ask a question in your Heart, in your Heart. Humble down. Humble down and say, “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” “Is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading living power of God?” You feel it? The first time one feels the all-pervading power, it is subtle. It does all the living work.

Put down your hands. Also you must know how to give yourself a protection before we leave. Put your left hand towards me and the right hand has to be used for giving protection. Let’s start it. [Shri Mataji demonstrates giving bandhan instructing seekers to move the hand seven times over the top of the head.] Now, nothing can enter into your aura.

Another thing that we do that is only done for the people who belong to the inner circle of Sahaja Yoga. It’s a secret and it’s not given to people who do not belong, because Truth also is not easy to get. Christ said, “I am the light, I am the power.” Which He was, no doubt. But they crucified Him. So I’ve seen in Sahaja Yoga when we start telling them about the Truth, we sometimes [UNCLEAR] and we lose them and they are lost. So the thing would be that I leave it to you, Yogi Mahajan, to find out who can be taken up for that, who cannot be lost by that, because immediately their ego comes up. So we’ll see about it and then, if you are coming to Santa Cruz, also, we’ll work it out there. But you cannot go on like this. You have to face it because it’s such a very deep thing you have to get out of it. It’s very easy for Indians to understand but for Western minds it is rather difficult. They start thinking about it. We don’t want that you should again write about in terms that you did in 1973. So to progress you have to do something more about it but that you do not expose. Be very careful. Not in India. In India it is fine. Even now I know people who are nowhere near. They are still thinking, they are egoistical, they did not do any of these things, they didn’t want to feel the cool breeze and all things like that. There are people like that so I leave it to him to choose and whatever seems proper he should do it accordingly. But it’s a thing which if you can somehow or other manage to be there, it’s a thing of very great depth and you can really grow into it and when I’m there, I think one should do it.

Yogi Mahajan: I’ve been put into a very difficult predicament. I don’t want to sound discriminating, What we could do is that the people who have been attending our earlier meetings can join us for a puja ceremony which we would be doing tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: You have to do puja to your guru. It’s a custom in India to do that. But actually I have nothing to gain. To be very frank, I shudder. I told him I will not have puja here in San Francisco because the vibrations start flowing so tremendously and then the people are not able to receive it. I have to bear it up in my body for some time and I feel so restless about it. When I want to sleep off and trying to talk after that... I have nothing to gain out of that but you have to gain something out of that happening by which you get your vibrations working. But of course, those who’ve not felt the breeze should not come, to be honest with them. But whatever he says I leave it to him. He understands Americans better than me.
