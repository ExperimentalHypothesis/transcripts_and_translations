First, I'll speak in Hindi language and then in English. We are such a cosmopolitan people that I don’t know what language to take to.

[ENGLISH TRANSLATION (Hindi Talk) Scanned from English Divine Cool Breeze]
Shiva is the reflection of Sadashiva. Shiva's form is in our heart all the time in the form of our spirit It resides there. I would not say it is enlightened. When the Kundalini is awakened, then this Shiva gets awakened and this gets awakened in our nerves. Chaitanya is said to he 'Medha Sthiti'
First our heart and our brain get connected. Otherwise, ordinarily a person's brain goes one way and the mind runs the other way. When this union takes place, the light that is there within us, which comes from our spirit, flows in the form of Chaitanya from our heads and our fontanel bone area.What we have to understand further is that when this light comes within us, then gradually we see that our life changes. Our anger and other vices, start vanishing. Gradually all these things drop off and devotion is established within us. In devotion, a sense of detachment awakens Nothing is important any more
The form of Shiva is highly evolved. He is not bothered about anything. His hair is dishevelled, he is not bothered about the type of clothes he is wearing, what he should do. All this work he has given to Vishnu I le is himself detached from all this. 1 lis vehicle is Nandi who cannot in any way be tamed. Wherever it takes, Shiva goes there. Shiva is never bothered about what people might say, because he is contained within Himself. When he came for his wedding Shri Vishnu saw him and thought, "How could he be bridegroom for my sister?" But Parvati knew that it was only he who was worthy of her.
He was a happy-go-lucky type of person He was not bothered about anything. When one rises above everything, then for Him everything is alike. His attention never goes there This form of Shiva that we see, we find very endearing.
When the Shiva tattwa gets awakened in Sahaja Yogis, their life also starts changing. When people come to Sahaja Yoga, both men and women, are very fond of dressing up All the attention is on what they should wear. There are many beauty clinics and things and women are very caught up in all this. But when, by getting enlightened, you become beautiful from within, then all these things cease to be important and one looks only for the comfort of the spirit One stays away from bodily comforts. See these foreign Sahaja Yogis, they live in big houses, they have cars and everything, but when they come here, they are contented within themselves, It's not so with Indians Indians now also, wherever they travel, they need attached bathrooms and all sorts of things. Still, they are not able to rise above all this. I am surprised to find that in a poor country like India people still have so many desires left. These people said, 'Mother, take a big
10place for an ashram ' Our Indians never live in an ashram When we made this ashram, with such hard work and a lot of expenditure, nobody was prepared to live in it. We said we will pay you a salary to live in it, still they were not prepared. For My birthplace, Chhindwara, wespenl so much money and I said that retired Sahaja Yogis should stay there, the climate is very nice, it's a hill station. But nobody is prepared to go. Everybody is bothered about their comfort. My house, my place, my wife, my food should be cooked in this manner. They will eat only specia kind of food. We Indians are so conditioned up by our tastes; with the foreigners it is not so. By meditation until we overcome all this, we cannot ascend.
In the matters of sacrifice, we lag behind. For the purchase of land, for NGO project, Sahaja Yogis were asked to pay a little more puja money But there was a lot of hue and cry, complaints and al that. 1 have been doing everything without taking any money from you How does it matter ii you give a little more money for a noble cause? 1 have seen many sacrificing people in My lifetime, but, nowadays, this spirit couldn't be seen I don't see it nowadays. I know about Mv mother, if she had even one saree more than six, she would give it away. When, people come tc Cabella, I am surprised, they want separate rooms, they do not want to stay with everyone. Ont who cannot be collective, cannot be a Sahaja Yogi. He still thinks, '1 am special, 1 must have somt special arrangements'. He is a Sahaja Yogi in name only. One who worships Shiva, he should bt like Shiva You make him sleep anywhere, give him anything to eat, one who is noi bound by time, is not bound by anything, only such a person is Sahaja Yogi. And you have Shivji's Tradurbhava' (manifestation) in you. But to attain this, God knows, what Tapasya people undergo and anywhere you go they will snatch all your money and what not It is not so in Sahaja Yoga But this 'Vriti' (tendency) that we have in ourselves, we should give up. We should try and set what all we can give up. Until you do not get this 'masti' (ecstacy) within you, you cannot bi called a worshipper of Shiva.
Mataji has all types of worshippers, there is nothing special about that. Whatever they do, t Mother is a Mother, Mother will forgive them. But by being forgiven, you cannot reach that state In forgiveness the most important thing is that one should always ask for Shiva’s forgiveness because we are at each step doing things we should not be doing. So we should ask for forgiveness from Shiva Shambhu. We make this mistake and that mistake, we have this need and that need- till we have these needs within us, we should keep asking forgiveness from God This feeling ol possessiveness—my house, my wife—until we can overcome this, we cannot be Shiva Bhaktas In this regard, it is very surprising that while foreigners who have never heard of Shiva's name have benefitted so much, we are still caught in small things and consider that so important. To bt. Shiva means that the hatred and negativities that are there within us, we should give them up But even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, people are unable to see themselves. I have heard there is
lia mother-in-law who is ill-treating her daughter-in-law. When 1 asked her why she is doing sc she said, 'I have never ill-treated anyone.' Really? They will go to the cinema and see a mother in-law ill-treating her daughter-in-law and start crying, but they will come home and do th same thing. Or, the daughter-in-law will ill-treat the mother-in-law and will say that 'I hav never ill-treated anyone'. Without being truthful within, you cannot ascend in Sahaja Yoga.
Sahaja Yoga changes your life, you have become pure like gold, and gold cannot be tarnished Now you have become that, reached that state. Why is it that you are still slaves of thes innumerable things in this world? This is the speciality of Kundalini, that it cleanses yoi completely. Now, service. Yes, you should do service too, but I really do not require any servio from you. I am self contained. What are you going to do for Me? The only thing is that yoi should also be self contained and enjoy yourself. In that state of joy, you should think that al these things are meant for enjoyment and that by doing Sahaja Yoga when you are already m tha state of joy, then why do you need to do all this?
After much brooding, I have come to the conclusion that Sahaja is very simple and that's why i is very difficult. If somebody is there standing with a stick and saying, 'alright now shave of your heads, wear saffron clothes', hunger strike for 14 days, then it will be alright. But acceptinj Sahaja with heart, mind and brain, one should condemn one s misdeeds and improve oneself why do I do like that? Should have I done that? By doing this, you will be able to give up man; bad things and find that you are 'Samartha' (Capable). You have no needs, no desires, you an sitting comfortably. And it is surprising that when the Chaitanya knows that you require nothing then it will serve you a platter full of everything. May be that it is to tempt you. There is no neet of yours that it cannot fulfil.
Today we did so much 'Avahan' (invocation) of Shivji and he actually likes this sort of people The difference between Him and Me is that I like all sort of people. He only likes those kind o people who have given up all this. We have these conditionings for everything—we should wea this type of dpthes. If we don't; so what? But in Sahaja, Sanyas is not from the outside, but fron within. From within, you become a Sanyasi and then no desire remains. Wherever you are, yoi are joyful. First there were 'Nath Panthis', they used to wander all over and they taught peoph a lot of things. I am surprised, how much these people travelled! When I went to Colombia found out that these people had even reached Bolivia. When you go to Colombia in an aeroplane you feel giddy, it is at such a height, and at that time people used to go on foot. So I don' understand how these people might have reached there. In Russia also and other countries the) travelled How they lived, how they travelled all over, what they wore, no-one knows! Becausf you reach that state where you become a miraculous person, like 'Shirdi Sainath’. He appean anywhere, helps anyone. People say, 'Mother, we saw him'. I say, 'Yes, it is possible'. Such peoplt become immortal because the killing tendecies in them get finished and that make them mortal They become immortal. And to achieve this immortality is the real puja of Shivji

[English]

I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship – what should happen to you. But today, I am going to tell you about the internal happening within us when you get your Realization. There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven rudras. They are particles, we can say, anshas, they call it, of Shiva’s powers, and all of them try to take out or to remove all the false ideas we have about life. When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened, eleven of them. And say, for example, Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

Now, all of them what they do is to control us from falling into the prey of various things, like we have an ego. So, Buddha will look after the ego part. He will see that you get shocked by your ego. You will be quite amazed how you could be so egoistical, and so insulting, and so humiliating. But when this rudra is not awakened, when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens? You start justifying yourself. You think whatever you do is correct, whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said, whatever you have achieved, you think is your right. You’ve done nothing wrong. For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego, if you go on becoming egoistical, you become absolutely a right-sided personality. Once you are a right-sided personality, you will know what all the symptoms there are of such a person. Now, for that if you just watch and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you, what wrong ideas you had about yourself. So that’s why Mohammed Sahib has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.” He didn’t know what else to tell. Because this ego business can really burst you, your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless, cannot move.  Consciously, people cannot move. Unconsciously they will, but not consciously. And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile. You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.  They can’t sit on their own. In a very young age, this can happen. This is happening in America also. I have seen two, three cases here, in India also such a thing is happening.

So if you do not try to see your ego and control it, and feel repentant about it. In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance, we don’t believe in repentance. Because we believe that you all have got your Realization. You are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true. We have to repent.

There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry. Sorry for everything, they'll say sorry. Even telephone if you pick up, they say “sorry.” I say, “Sorry, for what?” But this sorry itself is very empty.  It has no meaning. It has no depth.  When you say “sorry”, you have to see why you are saying “sorry” and what is to be corrected.

This is a very big problem of today’s generation where people have developed such tremendous ego, because all our economic growth, all our industrial developments, all our big, big organizations, all of them have given us a way that we should all develop our ego. If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere. And that’s how we start pampering it, and then this right-sided problem starts.

Then, as a reaction, it goes to the left side. Actually, in the head it is on the right side. Here is the right side, ego comes up, so the left rudra is that of Mahavira. So people do things, which are sinful, which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira who controls. He says, “You will go to hell. This will happen.” He describes all the hell, all kinds of hell, that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive - I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you. But that hasn’t helped.

So, people start getting more onto the left side and I should say, through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless, then a tremendous depression comes in. One feels very depressed.

“Oh God! What a depression I have! I am so sick. I am this thing.” And then, you try to frighten others with your depressions. You show sort of a, what you call, emotional blackmail you do. All kinds of things you will do, and beat your head and do all kinds of things. Could be through ego, could be through this left side problem of the left rudra.

These two rudras are very important because they are directly connected with our left and right sympathetic nervous system. So, is very important to see that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras. These rudras are to be satisfied. So to be normal, at least, look after these two rudras, which are: one is one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity. “I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

All this works out into physically, also into very serious problems like cancer. If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer. But all this portion gets swollen up. It’s called as the medha. This all portion gets swollen up and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over. At least would be here or may be there. Because such a swing in the nature of a person that you can’t say from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come because the rudras have become ineffective. It can be due to the depressive nature or oppressive nature. It could be due to many other factors also. But all these factors are nothing but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s or Sadashiva’s powers. He is the One who is full of karuna - full of compassion. He is the ocean of compassion. If you ask Him forgiveness, He will forgive. Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask for forgiveness, then He forgives.

But if you think you, whatever you’ve done is good, you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer.  Then, it knows.  Shiva knows everything, isn’t it? And, because it knows, it starts giving up. So, there’s a big combination of your will power to be there and the combination of the blessings of Shiva. When the Shiva blesses you, your will power also heightens. But you must have full will power to know that you have to be of a higher level of personality.

He was not at all a mundane guy. I mean, He was... supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that. How will He look there? People will laugh at Him. When I met some hippies, I said, “Why are you having this kind of hair?” So they said, “We want to…” They are all primitive. So he said, “I want to be primitive.” I said, “But the brain is modern. What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

So, deception! Deceiving yourself is not going to help. Best thing is to face yourself and understand what wrong you have been doing. If it works out, I tell you, so many sahaja yogis you are sitting here. If you correct yourself and become that, I am sure, all the problems – political, economic – and all stupid problems we have, will be finished. But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga, that even the worst people are carrying on.

Now, we have a responsibility to save this world. We have a responsibility to create a great, honourable life, which is not superficial, which is not just to show off. But inside, it should develop so that this light of your spirit spreads and enlightens this world. It’s very important to understand all these troubles and, I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases, and all other problems, which are in a collective way, we can call of the Kali Yuga, like political, economic; all these problems - only are created by human beings.

They are not created by the Divine Force. But Divine Force tries to neutralize them: if there are many sahaja yogis, who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word. If that could be done, if that could be achieved, then I think, we can do a lot - a lot for the betterment of humanity, and that’s why we have got Realization. It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family, it’s not only for your city or country, but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

Now, if you have to do competition, you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else. But people are so superficial, that they think by showing off or by becoming something – a big Johnny – they will achieve something of a very great level. It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also, so that you understand that whatever you are doing is for the betterment of global problems.

Absolutely, we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine. If I could do it alone, I would have done it. But I can’t, so that’s why I had to gather you all and to tell you that you become all the channels. But in the meanwhile, you enjoy, you enjoy life, every second becomes a joy, which is also the gift of Shiva. Shiva is the One who creates this great admiration and great appreciation of every moment, everything that is there.

And, that is the state we have to achieve by not condemning yourself or not by pampering your ego, but by seeing what you are. That’s the main thing one has to see – what problem you have and what is troubling you is yourself. If you could just come to that point of understanding, I am sure - I am very, very sure that you will be such an asset to help to make this world look at itself and change; because superficially you cannot change such deep rooted problems. And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini, that you can really become a great torch, I should say, torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

May God bless you!
