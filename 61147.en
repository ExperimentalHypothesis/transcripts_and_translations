I bow to all the seekers of the Truth.

Yesterday I told you that Truth is what it is. And with human awareness you cannot know it. For that you have to become a subtler being. To know the Truth, you have to become a subtler being. For all these there is a mechanism within you which works it out. It is sahaj means is spontaneous. And also, every human being has a right to get the yoga means the union with this all-pervading power of God. Of course, you cannot pay for it. Like the Mother Earth has the built-in quality it her to sprout a seed which has built-in sprouting quality. In the same way this is the living process of our evolutionary end.

Yesterday I told you how it works and what are the advantages of getting your self-realization. With that you get physically, mentally, emotionally balanced and you get cured of your problems. You become extremely dynamic and extremely compassionate. Now also as I told you that you become the Spirit. So today I want to tell you about the nature of the Spirit. Spirit connects you to this all-pervading power. But unclear() it is the source of all the knowledge. For example, when you get your self-realization, you feel a cool breeze coming into your hands and coming out of your head. This is you feel the all-pervading power, the subtle pervading power which you have not felt before. And also on these five fingers, six and seven you feel the subtle centers within yourself. On the left-hand side you see the problems of your emotional life. And the right side you feel the physical and mental side. Now we unclear() five six and seven centers in ourselves. What is wrong we ask and what is wrong it comes. And on these fingertips you can feel the heat or you can feel the burning sometimes little bit and sometimes you feel absolutely a numbness. Now when you feel anything like you can decode it. And then you should know how to get over the problems. Then you can cure yourself and you can cure others also. So, it becomes so very easy: to cure very serious unclear (diseases). So now the main object of our life is to become the Spirit. When you become the Spirit then the light of the Spirit spreads in your attention, so that on your central nevus system you can feel the Truth. So, you can have absolute knowledge as if you become a Divine computer. And everyone gets the same information. So, you become knowledgeable of actual Truth, there is no difference of opinion. As you can feel others you become really collectively conscious. You become collectively conscious means your awareness expands. And that awareness makes you feel that you are part and parcel of the whole. You get it collectively conscious that means who is the other? The second thing that happens to you: that you become thoughtlessly aware. That means a thought rises and falls and another thought rises and falls. And in between the thoughts there is a little space. While we are only jumping on the cusp of the thoughts that is coming from the future or the past.

So, when the Kundalini rises then these thoughts become small and the space in between the thoughts increases - it is the present. Alright, now we look at anything we start reacting with thoughts. For example, a nice carpet is here, I look at it and I start thinking about it, all kinds of joyless thoughts. Like how much it has cost and whose it is and all kinds of nonsense. But if I look at it without thinking then the joy that is put in its artists whole joy becomes abstract and starts falling from my head soothing me down. Now this is what unclear() beautiful buildings. I would think of anything but the joy that has put into it by its creators, the artists started falling all over. I felt so refreshed and so relaxed and joyous. So, the attention becomes full of joy. When the Kundalini rises, She cleanses all your centers and nourishes them.

Alright, we have got difficulties as we found this gentleman whose mother is unclear() and he is very poor.

Translator: Bahot mushkil hai (very difficult)

Shri Mataji: I know that.

Translator: I think she can translate better.

Shri Mataji: She can correct. Alright, tell him the words. Alright, alright she is also a little diffident about it. Because of the language. He is also he is saying that she can do better.

Female Translator: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: We need two persons. You will have to try. There are limitations of every language especially English.

So, we know the Truth because of the which is the embodiment of the Truth. Now also our attention gets enlightened because Spirit is the source of light. So, sitting down here you can find out about anybody’s vibrations. Also, this Spirit is the source of joy. And this source of joy takes you away from the duality of happiness and unhappiness. So that you reside in the beautiful realm of peace. The feelings you have for each other is only of pure love. That is in your attention there is no lust and greed. Because you develop a witness state (Sakshi Swaroop). Now witness state is a state where you see everything as a drama. Supposing you are standing in the water then you are afraid of the waves. But somehow if you can get on to the boat then you can watch the waves. But If you know how to swim then you can jump in the water and save many people. Thus, you become the saviors of the people. The first power you get that you become thoughtlessly aware. Second you get become collectively consciousness. And the third power you get that you can raise the kundalini of others and give them self-realization. Thus, you can cure others and also you can give self-realization. And you become self-confident. Because gradually you feel that you are protected from this all-pervading power. And you get experiences of great miracles of help that you get from this all-pervading power. Moreover, I have seen many musicians, artists have suddenly become great artists, world famous artists after getting self-realization. You feel very young and the energy is all the time flowing in you. The attitude towards your self-changes and you understand your glory and your greatness. But you do not get into a ego state by which you dominate others. Neither you dominate nor you take domination. Anybody who tries to dominate you is looked after by the all-pervading power. And then you become a universal being. Now those people who have come to your country are from different western world. Now these people are singing Sanskrit songs and Hindi and Marathi songs which are very difficult to sing. We could not teach even one sentence to an English man in Hindi language properly. They lived in India for 300 years and did not learn any of our Music or our language nothing. But now I find with sahaja yoga they are singing just like an Indian. And next time you will find them singing in unclear (Jugoslavakian) songs. So, an absolute rapport is established. This is what we want today. Then you become your own master. You become very powerful. There are so many habits we have which we want to give up, but we cannot because we are not so powerful. But when you become a self-realized soul, all habits drop out automatically. You exactly know what is good and what is bad. And you will always do whatever is benevolent to you. Which is benevolent to your society, to your country to the whole world. You automatically become a very righteous person, a very moral person and a very loving person. You forgive people and enjoy the forgiveness. And then you love, after forgiving you love. There is such an cean of love that you become extremely patient peaceful, relaxed. This is the new age. This is the last judgement. As Mohammad sahab also has said in his Quran that your hands will speak and they will judge you at the time of resurrection. He calls this as resurrection time. So sahaja yoga relates to all the religions and gives the essence of all the religions and the Truth about the all the religions. Because of that there can not be any quarrel between the two religions. It relates to science completely. It explains science. It points out the unclear (origins, Hurajians) of science. And also, it explains all the problems of Ecology and Politics and Economies. Thus, we become very knowledgeable knowing all the principles of every ideology. For example, if I am very powerful, I am a capitalist. But I can not live with my capital I have to distribute so I am an absolute communist. What I distribute is the love that I have. We have never used the power of love so far. Never. We have never used the power of love. They have only used the power of hatred. So now you should know that you are the instrument of the power of love. And that is the most powerful weapon we have. These great times are already prophesized thousands of years back. And now the time has come to full fill all the promises. In the early days / ancient days there were very few flowers on the tree of life. Now it’s a blossom time. That there are so many seekers today of truth that is the blossom time. Also, luckily I have developed a method by which we can give a mass self-realization.

So, I asked them to ask questions yesterday have they given the questions? Now wirttendown(write-down).

Yogi: Yes, we got the questions before the evening began. The first question was already answered regarding the Quran.

Shri Mataji: Ya.

Yogini: How todays person can harmonize his life with his wish to get self-realization? Whether it’s a process psychological, mental or social.

Shri Mataji: It is neither physical nor psychological nor mental. It is spiritual. It is beyond these three aspects. I have said that it is beyond all these three. As we say in Sanskrit - Gunateet. It is beyond these three things is a spiritual. Or you can say spiritual manifestation. All these three things you already have. What is there to think about them? This is beyond which we do not have it in us manifested.

Yogi: The next question is – what is your opinion about the Vedas, they made a university in Prague by Americans. Vedic university and they have put one topic in their course – Transcendental Meditation.

Shri Mataji: Oh my God, in the Vedas unclear() marketed. TM is a marketing company. Now please see that these horrible things are not here. They use black magic. In the Vedas it is written in the beginning only that after knowing the Vedas if you do not get your self-realization, it is useless. Now the word Veda comes from the word Vidh. Vidh means to know on your central nervus system. Now also in the Vedas it is written that after getting your self-realization you should know the Tantr, Yantr and Mantr. Now the Yantr means the mechanism. After realization not before. After realization you should know the mechanism. Then you should know the Trantra means the technique. And thirdly you should know the Mantra means what is to be said to open the centers. What chanting has to be said for opening the centers. And you see this chakra, Agnya chakra of Christ, you have to say Lord’s prayer. To open the center. You have to say Lords’ prayer and you have to forgive everyone. You must ask TM people first to give your realization. They are marketing everything. And they have ruined so many lives already.

Too many questions. Those questions that came before are better. These are not. Too much. Because we have limited time and yesterday they asked us to go out after unclear(). So these are individual problems which we will solve you later on, we are of follow on tomorrow. What is the address for the follow on. Tomorrow they will be having follow on, and just now we’ll have our self-realization. That is much better. They will tell you the practical side of sahaja yoga. Address batado (tell the address) Dheere Dheere batado woh likh rahi (tell them slowly, they are noting it down), Time bhee batao (tell the time also).

Now, let us now get to the point why we are here. I am sorry the acoustics are not alright. But will tell you slowly and try to understand. You must do everything very carefully. So, you should see how it is to be done. Yesterday you missed one point. When they said that put your hand on the back side of the head you put it on the back side of your neck. It should be here, that’s very important specially for Prague. I have seen this center catches very much here. On the back side of your head. Optic lobe is there. Alright, so now somebody will show you how to do.

Alright If you can move a little bit, then they can also see I think.

Tomorrow in follow on they will tell you. Its much simpler than this. But they will tell you tomorrow the simplest method in follow on.

Alright.

So first you please have to take out your shoes because this Mother Earth is going to help us. Please do it peacefully not to make noise. Peacefully. Please put both the feet away from each other because these are two powers working.

See the acoustics are not good. Put little away. Now speak.

Now, you have to put both the feet away from each other and sit comfortably not pushing too much forward or backward but comfortably straight. Now please know there are two conditions before we start. The first condition as I told you yesterday that you have to forget your past. You have to be in the present. That is you have to know that you are not guilty of anything. After all you are human beings so what mistakes can you commit? You are not Gods so why should you feel guilty? What ever the past is finished. You have to be in the present today. This is very important. Yesterday many people did not get realization because they are still feeling guilty. Alright now, you will have to know that whether you forgive someone or don’t forget someone you don’t do anything. But if you do not forgive then you suffer for nothing at all. At the hands of others who want to torture you. So why should you play into the hands of other people? You please forgive everyone in general don’t think about individual. It’s very important. Because this Agnya chakra of Christ wont open unless and until you forgive. It is closed like this. And then it opens like this when you forgive. Then the Kundalini can pass through it. It’s very important and that’s why I am requesting you. You can not miss your self-realization. Firstly, you suffer by not forgiving and then also you will miss your self-realization by not forgiving. So why not forgive everyone once for all and be light? Alright so now you have to put your left-hand towards me like this. Left-hand symbolizes your desire to get self-realization. And the right-hand is for the action. So now we put our right-hand on our heart first. Here resides the spirit. Then we put our right-hand on the upper portion of our abdomen. Which is the center of your mastery. Now you put your right-hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, we work only on left side. This is the center of pure knowledge. That manifests on your central nervus system. Now please take your hand again back to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now you take your right-hand again on your heart. Now take your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This center catches when you feel guilty. And you develop diseases like spondylitis and angina. Now please take your right-hand on your forehead across and press both the temples. And put down your head. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now please take this right-hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. For your own satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading power of love. Now please stretch your palm, put down your head please. And put the center of your palm on the top of the fontanelle bone area which was soft bone. Now press it hard. Press it hard. Here you have to move your scalp with pressure. So please push back your fingers and put a nice pressure and move your scalp seven times clockwise. That’s all we will have to do.

Now the mistake I think is that: they didn’t pushout their fingers. They were holding head like this. You have to push out. Pushout and put a pressure. Pushout pushout fingers. And now put down your head and then move it seven times. Put down your head as much as you can put down. Please do it seven times slowly.

Now we can close your eyes, please take out your spectacles and don’t open your eyes till I tell you. Alright, now please put your left-hand towards me. And keep both the feet away from each other. Now please put right-hand on your heart. And now close your eyes. Please don’t open them till I tell you. Now here on the center of heart you have to ask me a question three times which is very fundamental. Here, please you may call me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please ask: Mother am I the Spirit? Ask this question three times. Now if you are the spirit, you are your Master. So please bring your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and on the left-hand side and press it with your fingers. Here please ask me another question three times: Mother, am I my own Master? I have already told you that I respect your freedom. And I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. Now please take your right-hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to ask six times because this center has six petals. And please ask: Shri Mataji or Mother please give me pure knowledge. Alright. Six times, this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving. So now please raise your right-hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. We have to open our upper chakras with our self-confidence. So here with full confidence please say ten times: Mother, I am my own Master. I have already told you that you are not this mind, you are not this psyche, you are not this mind, not this body but you are pure Spirit. Alright so now please raise your right-hand on top of your heart and press it hard. Now here you have to say with full confidence twelve times: Mother I am the Spirit. Now this all-pervading power of love is the Ocean of knowledge. It is the Ocean of joy. But above all it is the Ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed can be completely dissolved by the power of Ocean of forgiveness. So please raise your right-hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. And turn your head to your right. Here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times: Mother, I am not guilty at all. I have already told you, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. So now, please put your hand on your forehead so that you press both your temples of both the sides. And now bend your head. Here now you have to say with full confidence: Mother I forgive everyone. Say it from your heart, not how many times. Now carefully take back right-hand on the back side of your head. Push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say for your own satisfaction without counting mistakes, without feeling guilty you have to say: O all-pervading power of love, please forgive me if I have done something knowingly unknowingly. Again, say it from your heart. Please say it from your heart not how many times. Now please stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which is the soft bone. Which is a center, which was a soft bone. And now push back your fingers, please push back your fingers. And bend your head as much as you can. Here now I again cannot take your freedom, so you have to ask for your self-realization. Now move your scalp, now please move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise every time saying: Mother, please give me my self-realization. Now please take down your hands.

Put your right-hand towards me like this and bend your head. And see with your left-hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head, out of the fontanelle bone area. Don’t put your hand on the head but away from it. sometimes you get very far away. Now please put the left-hand towards me and put the right-hand bend your head. some people might get the hot/heat doesn’t matter. That means either you are feeling guilty, or you have not forgiven. Alright now again put right-hand towards me bend your head. And just again see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head or away from you. Now please rise both your hands and look upwards and ask a question three times: Mother, is this the cool breeze of all pervading power of pure love? Now take down your hands please. Put your hands towards me.

Those who have felt the cool breeze out of your head or hot breeze or in your fingertips please raise both your hands. Both your hands please. Both the hands I can’t see. I want to see properly. May God bless you. I bow to all the saints of Prague. I hope tomorrow you will all come all of you should come whether you have got realization or not for the program of follow on. Otherwise, it would be like parabola of Christ that some seeds fell on the rock, and some fell on the very fertile land. You don’t have to pay anything, nothing whatsoever. Only you have to give sometime and respect to your self-realization. Next year again I will be back to you, and I would like you all to be like great trees of peace and joy. These people will be coming down to Prague again and again and will make masters out of you.

Thank you very much.
