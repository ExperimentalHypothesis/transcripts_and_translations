Public Program , Noida (India), December 2nd ,1993

My salutations to all you seekers of truth.I heard that from Noida to its north,east, west and everywhere, a wave of Sahaja has spread.

It is very incredible that people living in this area are very internal in search of truth, this I didn’t know and didn’t expect it either.

But today when I saw the whole community, I was really surprised. There are so many lovers, who want to get their Self - Realisation and want to attain the knowledge that is inside them.

The reason for surprise is that earlier whatever religious systems were there in this place ,all of them became opposite to each other and when we used to live and roam around Meerut, the simplicity of the people was visible.

But I had never seen such an inner desire for God. And today looking at you people, it seems like a miracle to me.

That the land which you consider to be fertile and so many trees grow there, then this must be called especially the miracle of a Sahaja.

This way we have worked very hard in Maharashtra, worked for years. The saints and sages poured blood there.

Many things about Sahaja Yoga that you are hearing today,have been written before as well. But this kind of work has not been done there,such deep work has not been done there.

This deep work had to be done only in this place, around Noida. I don’t understand how all this happened.

And seeing all this I become overwhelmed.My heart is filled with emotion. I don’t understand what to say and what not to say.

[ Shri Mataji takes some water.]

Whether you know it or not, every human being is in search of happiness. He lives with whatever gives him happiness.

But in the condition in which man is ,he cannot attain happiness. When his ego or self - respect becomes happy in some way, then the man becomes happy.He finds comfort.

And when his ego gets hurt ,that also gives him pain.So man lives in the shadow of happiness and sorrow,day and night.

Hope today,despair tomorrow.

But there is no expression of joy in him.The happiness and sadness he gets from his ego,he also gets from his sanskars [values].

Like we have some sanskars,some good sanskar and when we want to go into some bad sanskars,then it hurts.Or when we see someone who has bad sanskars,we feel sad.

And when we see someone who has such good sanskars,how great a man is,we feel happy after seeing him.

So the human soul wanders in the movement of happiness and sorrow.Happiness can only be achieved when you are connected to the conscious creation of all animate and inanimate objects spread around you.

Patanjali [sage] has called it Ritambhara Pragya [ wisdom-bearing knowledge], by giving it a big name.But it is the same thing which we call Brahmachaitanya.

This chaitanya of Brahma which is spread all around ,is a very huge truth.And today you are seeing this creation of flowers ,all these beautiful things that you are seeing,all these are the work of the same consciousness.

Every living activity is done by this Brahmachaitanya and knowingly or unknowingly man also desires to unite with that same Brahmachaitanya through yoga .

But sometimes he does not realize this.

The other truth is that man is today sitting in the troubles of happiness and sorrow.

And the one who is suffering from all his physical ,mental and intellectual spiritual things and believes that all these are his things ,he is actually a pure soul .

These are just titles and when he becomes a pure soul , only then the light of bliss starts coming in him.Now happiness also has different forms.

There is a joy which a person will feel and when he meets everyone , he will see that so many people are good and I am also one of them and so much change is taking place in me,then he will feel blissful on seeing that change but he will assess it or understand it with his intellect only.

His work will be based on intellect only,he will see that wow,what wonderful people are being prepared .

See,Sahaja is spreading in such a big country and I am also a Sahaja Yogi.

A joy will descend from that but one has to climb higher than that.There are many such paths of joy.

The  person who is miserly at first will enjoy satisfying people with the wealth he has ,making people happy ,feeding people.

In this way ,we have started  experiencing a different kind of joy.

Earlier, when you used to go to the market, you used to buy something for yourself. Now you think that this thing will be good for them. You buy that thing for them.

Then you start thinking that all the inanimate objects in the world, matter, material things, have only one use, that is to express your love in them. To give that thing to people.

This is Premananda [bliss of love], the joy that comes from loving others is Premananda and this is nirvyaja [genuine], there is no expectation in this, that what should the one whom we have loved do with us, what good should he do with us or what has he done to us, this thought does not even come. 

Whatever has happened has happened, whatever has to be done has been done and we are enjoying it.

After that, a new dimension comes in many artists and they think about how to make such paintings, which makes the Sahaji happy.

The people of Sahaja will become happy and those paintings must be such that chaitanya [ consciousness] should flow from them.If chaitanya does not flow from it, there will be no happiness.

Then if any artist makes such a picture from which chaitanya is flowing, then he sits in that blissful state.

He is not worried about how much hard work I did, what I did, what thing I picked up, what thing I put in it, how many rupees I spent, none.

He feels that at least such a thing has been made from which waves of chaitanya are coming.

So after looking at that mirror he feels that I have also become something. The things made by my hands, chaitanya comes from them.

Even today there are such great artists whose paintings emanate waves of chaitanya. And they create such a beautiful environment.

But you cannot know this information unless you have chaitanya in your hands and in such new dimensions every artist takes on a new role and even those who are not artists.

I have heard many people who have never written a poem ,let alone any prose poetry .They start writing poems and they write very good and deep poems in such rhyme and songs, that they themselves are surprised that they never wrote it and they never knew who wrote it, became such a beautiful thing.

And in his song, just like people were singing here. Dancing with so much joy, because the conscious power of chaitanya inside him is giving you joy and you were immersed in the joy of such art and you also knew that you are giving joy to everyone.

Chaitanya is flowing inside everyone. Chaitanya can flow from inside every art. Although the one who makes it, runs it, says it, sings it ,is a human being,but waves of chaitanya emerge from within him as if someone is playing a flute.

We have seen a very big demonstration of all these things in Sahaja Yoga. Everywhere, not only in India, but also outside, everywhere art has blossomed.

Many artists who came to play in front of us are famous artists in the world today and many artists, especially in the abroad, are not so much in music, but are earning a lot of name in art and paintings. In this way, man is getting new joy in everything.

Thirdly, many people are active, remain busy at work.  Those people work but it is a lot of trouble, it is labour, they think what is this.

When did they leave their job and we sat comfortably and there was so much trouble. I saw this after Sahaja Yoga.

Just yesterday a gentleman was telling me that till three o'clock in the night they were making flags and gates. They were putting up arches.

I said you people have been putting up arches for so many days, don't you get tired?

They said, no Mother we were enjoying so much, we were enjoying a lot and with that joy we all were working.

And what joy we all had together it felt as if Goddess's night vigil was going on and god knows for how many days they toiled, how many gates they put up.

You people have done so much decoration, I think that all this too is an expression of love. The love that you people have, is hidden in all these things, laughing and being happy.

You should again say this, the joy of karm [work], the karm that you have done, because you do not even feel that you are doing work.

You feel that no, we are having fun, this is happening, that is happening. You start enjoying everything. Not only this, you will enjoy your own work too, you will enjoy everything and then there is a collective joy.

In this collective joy, you have done with the group whether it is singing and playing, erecting a pandal, putting up posters, who knows what all.

You enjoy any of these things because this too is a great collective joy.Collective joy is a very high thing, there is no jealousy among each other, there is no jealousy and whoever does more work, then there is a lot of pride and great respect for him.

There is another joy apart from this joy, in which you are overwhelmed with respect and devotion in your heart.

This also awakens a new dimension of devotion within you. There were many people who did not even believe in God. But today in Sahaja they dance like mad people, no one can stop them.

They get up and start dancing.I asked him, why did you start dancing?I can't stop myself ,Mother, the whole body starts dancing from within. So whatever the joy of dance is, that kind of joy starts coming.

They do not care whether they know how to dance or not, just the whole body gets swayed by joy and everyone starts dancing in the same movement.

But there is no pomp with this, all the work is done with simplicity.  There is no complaint of any kind in him and everyone laughs and jokes with each other with love.

I am amazed to see that, look, this person who did not speak at all yesterday, is a very demure person.

Today I don't know how he is joking with each other, laughing very loudly, speaking openly. The heart opens up completely. It opens up in such a way that even you cannot understand.

One day a gentleman came to meet me in America, he said, Mother, I don't know what you have done to me, I asked why?

He said I used to hate my uncle so much that I would get angry just by seeing his face, but today when I met him I immediately hugged him.

He started looking at me, what happened, has he gone mad?

I don't know where the hatred went and the anger that was there.

I don't know where it remained and I hugged him tightly.

Now he said, I liked it when I said this, he said, are you well? He said, why?

You have never done this to me, then tears started flowing from that uncle's eyes, tears started flowing.

He said, "What a miracle this is, how did you develop so much love for me?"

He said, all those things which were anger towards you, which seemed like hatred towards you, just went away on their own. I don't know, now I have become something else.

In this way, there are such beautiful shades in the transformation of a human being but still, they do not fit in the mind.

Man evaluates it with intellect and thinks that yesterday I was like this, how have I become like this today.

Oh brother, how did this miracle happen?These were my problems and I got rid of them.

Now He is the Paramchaitanya. You come to his court and he does all his work flawlessly.

And how he handles it, just keep watching. People always keep writing to me, Mother, this miracle happened, that miracle happened, they write about so many miracles.

So I asked someone to write down what miracles he is talking about.Let's publish a book.

In one month, he had enough files on both sides of his head.

He said, "Mother, which thing should I print from this, please take it out and tell me."

I said, "I don't have time to take it out."

And then I have seen many people have a lot of desire to write, to think, to pay attention to this matter.

In this way, I have written a small book on Sahaja Yoga, but many people have written books on Sahaja Yoga, whoever could write, wrote.

Those who never wrote anything, they are also writing a lot and they have written very good books.

I have never seen them, but when I saw them, they have written such good books on this matter.

You are putting all these new streams of thoughts in front of such a person, due to which a person starts thinking what this man is talking about.

Till today no one has answered the questions inside you. No one has told you which chakras are there inside you and which deities are seated on those chakras and what work they do and what powers you can attain after your awakening, till today no one has told, how is this man describing these inner powers.

He himself feels it, he himself has found it and he writes it. Now whether people believe him or not, he does not care

And most of all, his fear itself vanishes.

It becomes very difficult for him to fear anything. He does not fear anyone. He is not afraid of anyone.

Whatever he has to do, he does it by clearly saying it in front of everyone. He is not afraid.

He does not think of anyone that if I say this, what will he do and if I do that, what will he do. In the same way, he is like a lion, a king in the jungle. Similarly, in this Kali Yuga , there is a delusion of a great warrior. Be it a man or a woman.

I have seen that such displays of bravery come from within them that we never thought that this person would say or do something.

Many people who did not speak on stage.  I said, come on, stand up and speak, I started.

He said, Mother, I don't know how I was speaking, I didn't know I kept on speaking, I didn't know what I was saying.

Oh brother you spoke very well, I don't know Mother I was just speaking.

In this way many things happen suddenly because the light of the soul comes inside us. In the light of the soul we recognize each other.  We know the importance of each other.

And then the way we behave with one another, love overflows. So love is truth and truth is love.

When you know the truth, then you also know that you love the entire creation and the entire world.

You get only love and only love. And even if somebody troubles you or harasses you, then it is not something for you to worry about, you leave it to Paramchaitanya to take care of it.

In this way, solutions to all things find themselves and you are freed from the cycle of happiness and sorrow.

The thing which used to make you sad, now makes you laugh.What stupidity this is, look at their stupidity.

I have even seen that if someone is a Christian and he joins Sahaja, he sees the foolishness of Christians and if someone is a Hindu and he joins Sahaja, he sees the foolishness of Hindus. Similarly with Muslims, similarly with everyone.

When they start seeing the evils of their caste brothers, they become ready and try to remove these evils.

So a social joy starts coming in, family joy also comes when your wife is also a Sahaja Yogi, children are also Sahaja Yogis and you are also a Sahaja Yogi, then everyone sitting together does not talk about anything, they only talk about Sahaja Yoga.

I said, why are you talking so much about Sahaja Yoga?

They said, mother nothing gets finished, I don't know what we keep doing about Sahaja Yoga, nothing gets finished and we don't talk about anything.

In this way a new human is being prepared today. This should be known, I have nothing to do with this.

I would say that everyone worked in their respective times, according to the time. Whatever the saints had to say, they did it, whatever work the incarnations had to do, they did it.

All the great prophets who have been there, they all worked according to their respective times, the work had to be done at that time.

Today, the second task which has been given to me is that everyone's Kundalini should be awakened.

I am not doing it. Even thinking that I am doing it is also wrong. Your Kundalini gets awakened when you come in front of me.

I never feel that I awaken the Kundalini. It happens because there is definitely something due to which your Kundalini gets awakened in front of me, it gets awakened in front of a photo as well.

How does this happen? What is all this? You people do not even think about it.

Then you become absorbed in it and the other bliss ,which is a very big bliss which should be called Nirananda [free from attachment] comes inside you when you do not think about it at all, remain in bliss, there is no thinking, no contemplation, then your Kundalini gets awakened.

It is completely done. When you are sitting in bliss, then you become completely complete. And attaining perfection here is the beginning of Nirvana [Liberation].

Now many people have created their own imaginations of Nirvana in their own way. Nirvana means that you become completely lost in yourself, that itself is Nirvana.

No one can explain it because this is a state in which you reach,such a great state where for you everything is you, the whole universe is you, the whole world is you and you are contained in everything, this is such a state to attain it, you don't have to stand on your head, you don't need to do any other mantras or penance, nothing.

Once this awakening happens on its own, then just like a tree grows on its own, this state comes in the same way.

Today I want to say that you should just remember that while this state is coming, many obstacles can come in the way.

A Chinese person named Laotse became a great poet but he was a great monk and a great preacher, he started a religion named Tao, which means Tao.

Now he has given a description of the Yangtze river. I also went to see that river, its scene really changes every two to three minutes

And such beautiful trees and such beautiful mountains that the Chinese people use in their paintings, all the inspiration for it comes from there.

I remained sitting next to him for the entire twenty four hours.

His saying is that when you are travelling in this river, there are many whirlpools in it and there are many round places in it, from where you will have to take a detour because the land is rocky there.

All this will have to be done carefully, and then after that, here and there are so many beautiful scenes, so many beautiful trees are planted, seeing them, your mind will be tempted there, you will feel like getting down or you will think of getting it, so you do not have to look there, you should keep going straight .

When the sea comes closer, the river will grow on its own and its banks will move away automatically and your river will again merge into the sea.

And in reality, it happens in our life also in the case of Kundalini. When the Kundalini starts ascending, then there are obstructions in it.

There can be obstructions in the work force and also in the work system, that is, in the way of working, like if a person is doing a work, it is possible that while doing that work, some chakra inside him may get obstructed, that is why it is necessary to meditate in Sahaja Yoga.

For that, it is not necessary that you sit for hours to meditate. Not like this, suppose at 10 o'clock in the evening, before sleeping, if you meditate for 10 minutes at the most and in the morning before going out, you can move forward with complete peace.

But first, we should see what defect we have. There are many defects in us and which defect among them is it due to which we are not able to ascend, due to which we are not able to achieve.

This should be seen as completely peaceful. There is no need to hate ourselves, there is no need to blame ourselves.

You should understand that if our saree gets stained, then it is okay.

We can see this stain. Now we have to clean it. No one thinks that if there is a stain, we are very bad, nothing, it is an external thing, so whatever defects are there, they all fall off automatically.

If you look at them that this is not me, this is something else and in this way these defects get destroyed, then you become completely pure.

You become a pure soul and you have to achieve this state and then you achieve bliss. Every different experience of this bliss keeps coming, but it does not affect the intellect.

It becomes a state. Where a person remains in bliss and watches everything. It is like a drama which is called a Witness.

Seeing everything as a witness. Hey, this is happening, it is okay, that is happening, it is okay. He does not get disturbed by anything.

The language of Sthitpragya [ steady wisdom] that Shri Krishna has spoken is of such a person and he first said to attain knowledge.  

Attaining knowledge does not mean that you read books but it means that you should have an understanding of every nerve inside you, this central nervous system.

You should know about it like an animal. It does not have the thought of filth, man has the thought of filth. Now if man says that I am an animal then it is wrong and animal says that I am a human then that is also not the point, what is the difference, many subtle feelings have come in the central nervous system of man, many which are not there in the animal.

Now what can be the higher progress than this. The higher progress will be that the difference between you and a dog is that you know filth.

Similarly the subtle progress is that you know that this is a sin. This is evil. It is not to be done. The things which are taking you towards destruction are wrong.

Because your status has become higher. You have reached a great status from which these sensations have come inside you.

This is wrong.  This is asahaja - leave it. It goes away on its own. It cannot be left by the intellect, this is the difference.

Nirananda cannot be left by the intellect. It is dependent on Niranand only.Nirananda is the only refuge.

There is no bliss in it - leave it, there is no vibration - leave it. We don't need that thing which does not have vibration.

This thing starts coming inside you because it does not have that bliss.

That is why you never accept that thing and do not believe in it either.

For this, there is no need to go to any big university or read big Vedas or this and that.

This is a state of man. We did not become human by reading Vedas or Bible.

The inner nature, which should be called the natural state of a human being, which is within us, can only be that high state naturally.

No support is needed for it, no imposition is needed. You can reach it directly and you can attain it and this is your right.

  Every sadhak [seeker] has this right and this is the time for its fulfillment and all of you should attain it and after attaining it know what you are.

Then you will understand how glorious you are. How powerful you are and how much you have been loved and the biggest thing you will know is what is the only truth?

The only truth is the absolute truth which is called the only truth, till today people have made their own version of it, then you will know.

You can know on your fingers what the truth is, that which brings chaitanya is the truth.

The rest is all truth and after all these things are attained, gradually you start believing in yourself and you also start believing in this chaitanya and in this way your life reaches another level.

I think many people will reach this stage in this Kali Yuga. I did not expect this much earlier.

But now I think that another world is being created and when man reaches that other world then your society will prosper.

Your home will prosper. Your country will prosper and the welfare of the whole world lies in this. It is a special time and a special task.

All of you should join this. Everyone should join this. Keep adding as many people as you can and all their questions will be solved.

Not only this, they will understand. What do we have to become in this form of human beings?

What do we have to achieve? What is the meaning of our life? Science cannot answer this.

You will get this answer,when you will know the aim of your work. Then you will see that you will be overwhelmed with joy.

Seeing this in Noida, I really think that among the miracles of Sahaja, this is also a very big miracle.

Going to the village and giving the truth to all the people there.

This is also a very big task and this task is happening so easily.

It is happening with so much love. This is a big thing.

[Shri Mataji : What’s this sound?]

Now whatever is there, today I have to say this much that all of you should have faith in yourself.

You should not think about yourself in any way that hey, what am ? I am a sinner. I did this or that because day and night everyone keeps telling you that you are very bad.

You are like this, you are like that. Do not think about all this.

You have to think that I am a human and I am in a very high state.

Now I have to go to an even higher state.

This is a matter of great pride about you that you are a human and you can give awakening only to humans. You cannot give it to animals.

The second thing is that this sama[Atmosphere] is such. You were born in this sama.  

That too in this land of yoga, in this Bharatvarsh where many sages and saints have done a lot of penance, so you will get it very easily and after getting it, you have to think that this is a collective work.

Until collective work is not done in you, until you come in collectiveness, you will not grow, there will be no progress in you in any way.

You will remain at the bottom of the world, so think in your mind whether a seed should be thrown away after sprouting or it can be transformed into a tree.

If it can be made into a big tree, then why not and easily .Easily, do not waste any money on it. Do not run headlong for it, just come in collectiveness, like if one of our nails falls after being cut, will it grow, unless it is connected to the body, it cannot grow.

Similarly, this is a collective living institution and you should come in collectiveness in it.

See from that, your diseases, your troubles, your problems, all will go away. There is no doubt in this.

Just have faith in yourself and know that today all of you are going to get Self- Realization.  First you will feel awakened and cool air will start coming from your talu[Fontanel bone area].

First of all, there will be awakening and cold air will start coming from your talu . Some people may feel hot air, it doesn't matter.

And for the first time, such cold air waves will come in your hands which is this Paramchaitanya.

You will be surprised how we got it, but there is only one thing in this that I cannot force it.

It cannot be forced. If you do not want it, then it is better for you to leave and those who need it and want it wholeheartedly, the whole universe is ready for them.

The universe of consciousness is ready to help you cross it.

You people are very easy. It is very difficult in a foreign land, but here people cross it very easily.

There is no question about them.

[Shri Mataji takes some water.]

So if any of you wants to go out, if anyone wants to go, then go.

It will take a maximum of 5 to 10 minutes. Just 5 to 10 minutes, all of you should have faith that all of you can have Self-Realization.

Forget your past, your bygone days completely and there is no next day, right now you have to come to the present.

So please forget it. Don't think about it, don't chant any mantra, don't say anything and don't even stop your thoughts, Kundalini will do the whole work on its own.

She is your mother. Everyone has a different mother and she knows everything about you from your previous birth to your present state.

So don't look for any faults in yourself in any way. Don't look at your bad qualities and have complete faith and trust in yourself and achieve Self-Realization

Everyone is wishing that .

[ Shri Mataji : I will not be able to drink so hot, let it be, it is not necessary.]

All of you please come, it will be good if you sit. Sit anywhere, front or back.

Please be seated.

Sit down, sit anywhere, it doesn't matter, it doesn't make any difference.

Now put both your hands towards me like this and close your eyes. Take off your glasses too.

Do not open your eyes until I tell you to. Raise both your hands up towards me like this.

[Shri Mataji : Blowing on the mic.]

Now open your eyes.

Please open your eyes.

Now extend your left hand towards us and place your right hand on the head, not touching, not touching, keep it above and now bend your neck down.

Now see from your talu ,the talu where in childhood there was a very soft bone which was called Talu.

Place your hand on it and see if any cold or hot breeze is coming out .

Please see if there is a hot or a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

Now put the other hand towards me and bend your neck again.

Please put your heads down.

And see if a cold breeze is coming out of your talu or not, or a hot breeze is also coming.

If a hot breeze is coming, then you say ,Mother I have forgiven everyone, then a cold breeze will start coming from there.

Bend your neck, keep a little distance, huh. Ok one more time turn your left hand towards me and see with your right hand whether any cool or hot breeze is coming from your talu or not.

Maybe some will feel it very close, some will feel it far away.

Please do it with your left hand towards Me and right on top of your fontanel bone area and see if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of that area.

Some people feel it quite close and some people feel it quite far away, so you can move your hand, see for yourself, and bend your heads.

Look with your head bent, look with your head bent.

Now turn both your hands towards the sky and turn your head back.

Please put up both your hands and look up first.

Now ask one question : Mother, Is this Paramchaitanya?  Is this cool breeze is Paramchaitanya?

Now please ask the question :  Mother, Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

Now take your hands down. All have crossed.

Now whoever felt cold or hot breeze in their fingers or hands or palate, all of them raise their hands.

All those who felt the cool breeze, please. Look, tell me.

My salutations to all of you Sadhus [Saints].

Infinite blessings. All of you have crossed over.

It's amazing. But you have found this supreme power, you have touched it, you have seen it for the first time.

Now respect it and know it. See, these people have fled from so many countries to your country because they consider this to be a holy land and also want to elevate their level of Self-Realization.

So you too should understand this thing and understand its importance.

I hope all of you, by joining the collective, will make full progress

And I will come back after a year and then I will see how many trees have grown here.

My infinite blessings to all.
