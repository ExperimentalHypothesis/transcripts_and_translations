Evening Program: Eve of Kundalini Puja, Cabella, Italy 20 June 1992,He has Such Subtle Ideas About Describing Me

[At end of program, Shri Mataji explains the lyrics of ‘Anyatha Sharanam Nasti’, written by Ravindra Jain, which Hemlata has just sung.]

It’s very embarrassing for Me to translate this one. [Shri Mataji laughs] Most of it you must have understand: Sharanam means ‘to surrender’; anyatha means ‘to other’ – ‘to no one else I surrender,’ and the whole thing is for the surrender. I surrender my heart, I surrender my prana – it’s all surrendering to Me, and I must say, it is very embarrassing for Me to say this, so I surrender it to you. [laughter]

It’s a song from the Buddha’s... Buddha’s enlightenment, when the people – buddhists – used to say this, this ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachami.’ From that, this has come out, this idea. But actually, it is such an encompassing song. I mean, everything that you can think of; like ‘adyamsha’ and ‘antyam’; means... ‘adi’ means the beginning, ‘antyam’ means the end: ‘Everything I surrender to You.’ So in the whole song is the surrendering of every manifestation of feelings but which encompasses the whole thing. It’s like that. So I think there’s no translation needed, you all can understand it very well. If you know one word, is the ‘samarpayami’... [Hemlata explains something aside to Shri Mataji] This they have understood... ‘Swayam sakshat’ [Hemlata explains something further] ‘Swayam Siddhi’... She’s the... Siddhi and siddha – you know siddhi is the one, is the Power of miraculous working and siddha means the, itself means the enlightened one who knows all these things, so siddhi is the Power of the siddha. And that... so ‘prabha’ is the light, is the light – prabha is. So you see, this is... what they are saying that: You are the doer and You are the Power. So it is all – I will write it down for you, but it’s very embarrassing I think, to praise... [Hemlata again speaks aside]

Ah, this is another one when he... You see Krishna has said that – Dharma sanstha panarthaya– He came on this earth to establish religion, dharma. But what she said is: ‘Yoga sanstha panarthaya’ – this is a new thing that... this gentleman I tell you, this Ravindra Jain, though he’s blind he sees things which I also don’t know about. [laughs] Like, he says that: ‘Yoga sanstha panarthaya’, ‘I have not come here to establish religion, but to establish Yoga,’ which nobody has done so far. So he sees the point so clearly, so different from others. Like, Shri Krishna and all that came to establish religion, but She has come to establish Yoga. [Hemlata explains some more lyrics]

You see, their whole world is covered with the darkness – ‘Timira’ means darkness, [Hemlata: ‘Dishahina’] and there is no direction; there’s no direction for people, because there’s all darkness. [Hemlata: Atmasya Papanashini.] ’Atma...’[Hemlata repeats phrase]... and She’s the one who destroys the sin of your soul. [Hemlata: Bahujana Hitayo wani tawa, Shashwat Satya Prakashini] ‘Shashwat’... This is the... She’s the one who has come for the benevolence of many people –bahujana – and She is the eternal... ‘Prakashini’ you call manifestation? Manifestation of the eternal truth. ‘Prakashini’, means... She’s the one who gives... In English, there’s no word exactly: ‘She enlightens’, but enlightens... [aside in Hindi] So we can say that: ‘She’s the one who manifests the enlightenment of the truth.’ Is a fact.

So far, they have talked about the enlightenment, they have talked about the truth, but nobody has manifested the enlightenment of the truth. So you see, these... this gentleman – this blind gentleman, I must say – he, first of all, he has such subtle ideas about describing Me, which I Myself don’t know how he does it; how he catches the point. He actually sees Me different from other incarnations, and he takes out the points which are different from them, like this one especially.

[aside to Hemlata in Hindi] You see, she says that, there’s one where ‘Nirvaja’ is used – which  Adi Shankaracharya has also used – that Her love is ‘nirvaja’ means She doesn’t expect anything in return: nirvaji. Vaji is interest – She doesn’t expect any interest back. But here, it is even more than that he says. That, it’s the river flowing out; Her love, without any expectations, flowing all the time. He has a great...  I must say, a penetration into My life, I must say, because the way he has pointed out certain things there. As I told you before: [sounds like/ Sahaja Guna Uradharini]... means, She has Her... all virtues in a very spontaneous manner: She doesn’t exert for that, spontaneously it is there. This is something, is a discovery for Me.

[aside to Hemlata about another song: Hindi 68 ‘Sahaj. Yogini’] This one was another one he said about Me, that: ‘Tarkayukti’ – tarka means that I can argue, with arguments, by logic; I can convince people. Then it doesn’t work, then I play tricks: yukti, tarkayukti. And then ‘Pramanayukta’ – ‘She has got the proofs of everything.’ This is the... you see, this newness of My incarnation he has discovered so well. I must say, I was really amazed how he could find out all these points. So it’s a discovery for Myself also.

But this one, this Sharanam Nasti song, I think it’s very good for ego and for conditionings to be surrendered. That’s the solution: surrender it, your ego and your conditionings. But the problem is, when you try to surrender your ego, then you do it through your ego only, isn’t it? And when you try to take out your conditionings, that also you do through your ego. So the ego is still there; Mr Ego is still a little bit. [laughs] Then what to do, how to get rid of, is to clear out your Agnya, that’s all; by forgiving everyone. You forgive yourself, you forgive others: just go on forgiving, ego will disappear. A very simple solution of the whole thing is you forgive yourself, so your conditionings will drop out; you forgive others, so your ego will drop out. But from your heart, you must forgive. That’s the main thing is in Sahaja Yoga, as I’ve told you many a times.  Great things have happened within yourself, but the biggest thing has happened is that, now everything becomes identified with you because your heart is open, because you’re doing it from your heart. Anything done with your heart is absolutely genuine, and that has an effect.

But I’m also congratulating these people, apart from that; Hemlataji who is such an artist. I mean, she has done a great tapasya to achieve this, I must say. But these two artists also are remarkable. I have heard him before, [indicating one musician] I never heard him before. [indicating the other] But I am really amazed at his own creativity, the way he was creating different moods for the song. Is a very difficult thing, spontaneously to do. As you know, in Indian music, we don’t have any composition and there’s nothing written down; you have to create yourself, with the rapport with the audience. You have to see what sort of an audience is there, and also with the music. So I must congratulate, really, him very much for this. May God bless you. [applause]

There are very nice songs in the new cassette, and they are... will be releasing it – I mean, I’ll say that it will be released tomorrow, but actually they’ll be available now, for Guru Puja. You’ll be very happy to have it. This is one of the songs in that one which really settles you down. They’re very meditative. And this is the ‘sharanagat.’ Sharanagati is the best way to surrender. I don’t do anything: where is the ego there? Garma becomes a karma, means you don’t do anything. I too don’t do anything: nishkriya. May God bless you.

You have to thank them very much for giving us such a good night a very, not only entertaining, but so deep and so touching. Of course, we have to thank Sahaja Yogis from Spain for giving such a nice, beautiful program and to Belgium people and to the Holland people. Holland has really risen up so much, I’m very happy about it. I was amazed to see the way it was done so beautifully. Thank you very much.
