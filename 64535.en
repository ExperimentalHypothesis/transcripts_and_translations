Talk to Yogis: Arrival and Welcome, Love has no Bounds, 19 July 1996

[Yogis sing bhajans to welcome Shri Mataji and a Yogini introduces in Russian]

Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Are you all right? Thank you, thank you.

[Sahaja Yogini continues speaking in Russian, which Dr. Bogdan translates for Shri Mataji]

Dr. Bogdan: This is the filming lady. [translation] O great Mother of ours, all Sahaja Yogis in the city of Togliatti [inaudible]with love and thankfulness to meet You on our lands. Every one of Your comings here is a great blessing for us. Your energy and vibrations gives us so much power and energy. We are extremely thankful to You, Shri Mataji. Every one of Your comings here is a great blessing for us. May You do this for long and long and long, Shri Mataji. [last sentence not translated by Bogdan] Jai Shri Mataji! [Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!]

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much, thank you. [Yogis sing ‘Swagata Agata Swagatam’]

Sahaja Yogini [translated by Dr. Bogdan]: This is a welcome, Shri Mataji with greatest love. [several sentences are inaudible in the translation from Russian]

Dr. Bogdan: This is for the camera, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: I am very much [unclear] by your love, to come all the way from Togliatti just to greet Me here, with little, little sweet children whom I love very much. I know it’s raining, still you are all here; love has no bounds. It’s so enchanting. That’s how a poetry is created [unclear/in that atmosphere.] So far away is Togliatti and still you people – I don’t know how – you have managed to come all this way. The expression of love is so deep; I don’t know what I have done for you.

Sahaja Yogini [translated by Dr. Bogdan]: You are our great Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s true, I’m... I must say, in Russia, the mother has a special place. But this love, and this feeling is very difficult to explain and it’s like the whole ocean of compassion, and just your hearts [unclear] ripple of your feelings coming back. Love is so important here; more important than anything else. Only with this love, we can enjoy the bliss of the Divine. I am so happy to see you and... [Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji.] I am so full of [inaudible/tears] and the sky is crying for Me.

You have been so sweet and so nice. I was telling him [Dr. Bogdan] that there is a plane from Samara to Delhi every day – so many places I have never seen. That means it has come for you only, so you all can come to Delhi, [Yogis laugh] and I can come directly from Delhi to Togliatti. [Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji.]

May God bless you all. I hope for you to have all the best of life. The greatest is peace, compassion and joy.

[Shri Mataji and Yogis start walking, Yogis sing again. Conversation inaudible]

Dr. Bogdan: He will come Shri Mataji, he will come to the log cabins where You stay.

[Sahaja Yogini speaks in Russian, as a description for the video she has been recording]

Dr. Bogdan: This is in Russian, so we will translate it, Shri Mataji. [Sahaja Yogini speaks again in Russian, no audible translation]

Shri Mataji: Thank you. Be careful.  May God bless you. [more untranslated Russian]

Dr. Bogdan: He will come here, Shri Mataji. Apparently.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

Dr. Bogdan: Apparently he will come here. [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Ah, now you have a [unclear/baby] I’m told. Thank you very much. Thank you for your love. I bless you from My heart.

[Sahaja Yogini asks a question, for the video recording, which Dr. Bogdan translates]: Shri Mataji, do You want to [unclear/say anything to] Togliatti?

Shri Mataji: [unclear] Really, there are no words that can describe. I don’t know really how to say something because I never expected that, so many people in the whole world would take to Sahaja Yoga; to accept it in My lifetime. [unclear] when I see your beautiful faces and your enlightened souls, I think there is something special about you. That you should really be so much free in love; it shows a really large heart. I don’t know how to explain, because you are living in these modern times and most of you are working in the car business and despite that, you are very, I should say, very spiritual. I am very lucky to have met you all. You are so spiritual.

Like Christ and all these people, they did their level best but they couldn’t make [unclear/people like this.]  None of them. While you people are born at this time, a very special time, and have chosen to be in the Kingdom of God. Must be because of your life, previous lives, this life has been very pure. I just [unclear/ tighten My...] [Shri Mataji laughs]

Also I am thankful to Sasha for bringing Sahaja Yoga to Togliatti to be saved and [unclear]

Dr. Bogdan [translating for Sahaja Yogini]: Mother, we are still not perfect, but with every one of Your arrivals here, we try and we try to ascend, higher and higher.

Shri Mataji: You are My [inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi [translating for Yogini]: You are our Mother, You are our Great Mother, Shri Mataji. We are loving You from all our hearts. Our hearts are full with love, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: I can feel it, even the later [unclear]

All right, thank you very much, thank you again and again. I hope there is some conveyance to go back...
