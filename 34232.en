Shopping with Shri Mataji in Derby

Elisabeth says about it: "The shopping is in what was then "Debenhams" in the middle of Derby. The baby is mine... so I remember it well. Bala was there, also Douglas and Deviani. Barrie Brewster, Gavin, David and Hester Spiro... Rustum is in the Kitchen. The child is Gavin's daughter Olympia. Warren is also there near the car."
