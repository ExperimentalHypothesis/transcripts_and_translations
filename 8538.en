Honourable Minister Sahab. Honourable guests. Respected teachers, staff. And dearest students. It is very heartening to see. Students taking up. The cause of peace. When we were students. We had to fight the British. We could not think of peace at that time. We had to become free.

And people sacrifice so much for the cause of freedom. But today for the cause of peace. People must know they have to sacrifice. Why human beings, after being evolved to the state, when they are so developed, the more developed they are, the more dangerous they become. Why when we are so highly advanced. There is such a difference between our own kit and kin. What has gone wrong with our development? That's what we have to first see to the roots. To the basic cause why there is no peace in the world today? Actually, we are not at peace with ourselves.

Our physical body. Our mental body our emotional body. And the spiritual body are not integrated at all. There is no peace within, how can we have peace without? Sir, with all due respect to the United Nations. My husband is a secretary, one of the secretary generals of the United Nations. I feel the members of the United Nations also should see their peace with it. That's very important and the nations who support them also should try that.

What we need today is a transformation of human beings. I would like to court something what Shri Krishna said thousands of years back. That the human awareness, the chetana “चेतना” grows downwards and the roots of this chetana or the awareness is in the brain. So when we started growing in this advancement we started moving from a pedestal downward. In our Sahaja Yoga we consider 3 chakras as the lower chakras, the centres. One is the Nabhi where a person starts seeking food, shelter. All these life's necessities. Either he can go upward or he can go downward. At this point, the essence of the centre is what we call swaha, meaning the consumption. So all those people who started developing. Started consuming. Countries after countries, thank God, Columbus lost his way. Otherwise none of us would have been here.

And then the same countries went to the 2nd chakra which we call as Swadhisthana. At that point, they started entering into the space. That is Bhurva, Antariksha (अन्तरिक्ष). Into the space they went, tried to find out what is on the moon, what is on the Jupiter. Why not find out what is within ourselves? Instead of going outward. Now I heard to my great joy that Nalidkar has found out that there is energy as well as intelligence in those realms of the universe where all the stars move with certain speed and understanding.

But still this you are learning from outside. Now the third awareness has grown into the Muladhara in the other way round. I mean the same centres when ascending gives you another aspect. And so the attention went to this horrid thing called sex. And in the West people have become nothing but sex points. I've seen it everywhere that just filth exist with this movement. What do you expect people to be? They have to be violent.

If you make them worse than animals, what will happen? They have to be cruel, despotic And after this, the next step is hell. Nagasaki or anything that I have seen myself. Gives you a shock for a while, but human nature is such that it can overcome all these shocks, can go ahead, which is adhogati (अधोगति) is downward movement. So how to go upward, how to go to the roots?

I would say in all these advanced sciences in this universities what you learn is the knowledge of the tree. We have to know the knowledge of the roots. And for that we have to become subtler beings. With this gross mind you cannot reach them. We have to know that all the great saints and incarnations and prophets have said that you are to be born again. Mohammad Sahib has clearly said, at the time of resurrection, your hands will speak. He said that you have to become pir and I'm very happy to know, sir, that your name is Nabi, and you know the meaning of Nabi. So you have to become a nabhi. You have to become a pir. Christ has said you are to be born again.

In this country Everywhere In every place wherever there have been saints, they said, you are to be born again. Even a Brahmin is not a Brahmin unless and until he's born again. [unclear], the one who is born again. So we have false certificates. I'm born again. There are people who just certify themselves, oh, I am born again. This is the other problem of human beings that we have a conviction and a concept and an ideology and the issue for which we fight. But the absolute we cannot reach unless and until we ascend. This is the last breakthrough one has to achieve. Where you have to become the Spirit.

And the Spirit has the nature that it is collectively conscious. You don't have to tell that we are brothers and sisters. We become part and parcel of the whole. We become part and parcel of Akbar of Virat that we become on our central nervous system, not a mental conception. We fight with mental conceptions and ideologies. I've been to democratic countries, communist countries, socialist countries, all types. You have seen how Hitler was. He came out with a concept and he tried to ruin the Jews.

Now the Jews have taken over. I hope the Muslims don't take over from them. It was like a derailment, the violence moves from one to another. The reason is the assent has to be achieved. The movement is the other way round. I understand the science and the scientists have done great advancement in one direction. But the ones who have done this on the other direction of the roots, why not we see to them and listen to them and pay some attention to it. These outside conceptions and outside organisations and outside understanding can never never cure. Or eradicate the roots of violence within us.

For that, you have to become the Spirit. My mission works on a subtler plain where I work for people that they should become the Spirit. Spirit which is absolute. When you become the Spirit, you become collectively conscious as Jung has said it. Jung has clearly said that you have to become collectively conscious and that's how you become on your central nervous system. You know what's wrong with you, you know what's wrong with others. Automatically you get cured of your mental, physical, emotional problems, also your material problems get solved as Shri Krishna has said "Yoga-Kshema-Vahaamyaham" (योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्) I will look after your well-being when you get your yoga. Now the yoga doesn't mean standing on your head, it means. The kundalini, the power that is within us, which is of pure desire, should rise and should meet the divine, the all pervading power which is doing all the living work. This happens and has happened to thousands. I'm working now in about 16 countries. And I find that whatever maybe the conditions, whatever maybe the styles of that country. It works. But this country of mine It's so great, not in the city so much, but in the villages, in thousands. They become that.

They have given up all their bad habits they have become like [Shangsha?] or [Baksha?]. They have no habits nothing can dominate them. They have no violence in their mind but only the love, the love that is so powerful, love of God, which is all pervading. It is easy to say there is no God without seeing Him, without knowing Him without feeling Him, but why not? Try also this, all this living work that he does, these flowers he creates out of the flowers he makes the fruits. Is done by one power that is the power of God of His love we have never used the power of love. We have used the power of hatred so far.

Let us use the power of love and see how it works. It transforms human beings. Overnight people can change. It looks miraculous and fantastic, but you are fantastic. You have come out of amoeba stage to the stage for a particular purpose. Like supposing you take a television set to a villager, he will say, what is this? And if you say it has got all the power to show you all kinds of pictures. He won't believe you, but if you put it to the mains, it starts working and then you see how fantastic it is in the same way you receive that glory, that greatness, those powers that are within you as soon as you get connected, and it is spontaneous. You cannot pay for it. Those people who take money in the name of God and all that have ruined the name of God and religion and everything.

You cannot pay for it. You cannot force for it. It is so spontaneous because it's a living process of a living energy of living gods living love. I hope the modern students who are today in a great confusion. This is Ghor Kalyuga (घोर कलियुग) as they say. At this time it's important to keep your feet on your grounds. And see to it. That you can achieve it. Much faster than anybody else. Try and get to it.

It's so simple, it's so easy. Only you have to pay your attention to it. We have now some people from my children from abroad. And their ideas and their attitude and the whole thing is so much change. you can make them out from their faces. The whole face glows. I must thank we are so fortunate to have such a prime minister. I value him very much. Because he himself is a realised soul. Perhaps he does not know.

If I ever happen to meet him, I'll tell him about his own powers and yours too, sir. This is what one has to know. What am I? Once you know what you are, you can assert yourself and you can know how to manage it. Even if you have the power, if you have the electricity, you don't know how to use it, how will you manage? You have to just know the know how, and then you don't have to have any computers. You are the computer as it is. Nobody can create a computer like a human being, but then you become such a computer. That you know everything about everyone. This is what it is.

It is fantastic, no doubt and you are fantastic. I'm sure you realise your own worth and respect your own self and get to your Spirit. May God bless you all.
