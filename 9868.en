Buddha puja, part 1:
 
As you know, Sahaja yoga is not an organized, or a kind of organization.
 
Because it is a living process and all those who come to Sahaja yoga [very difficult] [liver] [inaudible] [cleaning], purified and then become Sahaja yogis.
 
So, one should be very careful, as not to be irresponsible about oneself, first of all and about the collective.
 
We have [leaders] [since, with] no power or no tradition when place to lead Sahaja yoga.
 
But in every country we have to appoint somebody as the leader and that leader is in contact with Me [].
 
As I cannot talk to every one of you directly, we have this leader, but if the leaders also are found to be not good or something wrong, they can be changed, but normally we don’t.
 
Normally leadership not to be challenged, normally.
 
Last year we, we had remove the leader of Australia.
 
He had to completely go out of Sahaja yoga. You see, we had to get some other leader first, if it does not work out, then we have to also remove the so-called leader.
 
So, this leader had created a big problem for Me and it was [really] very difficult for us to work for one, one month [before] again we [can] manage.
 
Also we removed very many Sahaja yogis who we found to be, against some leaders or were troubling the leaders, when the leaders [convey them of] that, we had to [do] of them. Because I trust the leaders first of all.
 
So, one should normally not complain and should looking to themselves with [generally mean] to others.
 
But a leader has to be about work and [a] [culture, coucher].
 
For example, if a leader is [carrying on with a girl] [inaudible], which is not allowed in Sahaja yoga. You have to marry.
 
Because it is wise not to, so such people are not allowed. No Sahaja yogi is allowed to have a [inaudible] and also not [try, cry] on that person.
 
In Sahaja Yoga [] how to [manage, marriage], not []
 
[] you have so much romance before marriage then as soon as you get married you get to divorces.
 
And in, say, in India we mostly have arranged marriages according to the family and all that. And we do not have divorces, very a few, I know you too [] my husband.
 
[] about a romance before marriage [] have romance after marriage.
 
So, you [must meet] as a [] forward to it.
 
Now most of the people who have got realization and got married after that [] thousand people have that. And out of that one or two marriages have failed into the hundred [] at the most.
 
[Marriage] created [] that gives a wrong pervert part of the party, then you are allowed to have a divorce, but the person who is wrong has go out of Sahaja Yoga.
 
Now the second part is that one should not feel ownership nor [] about good Sahaja Yoga marriage. It is very dangerous.
 
Now, for example, [] they said, there were programs and lots of money were collected [] should be accounted, and all of the Sahaja yogis must know where the money has gone, in should be absolutely clear [] absolutely clear.
 
 
And he said that in our country here not seem any organization so clean and so accountable.
 
And also every [] or getting paid to collect money [] if it is a large amount.
 
And any member of the organization should be able to see that account. Nobody should not be able to do that. It should be open book.
 
Even I, who can [] honesty [] everybody, but even then I keep the money in the bank and one of the Sahaja yogis keeps checkbooks with him.
 
 And, everybody knows how [] crowd and with respect when the money is in my account, that is, in my private account.
 
But, supposing [] and I want to spend some money like that, then I take it from my husband's account. [] because I don’t want Sahaja yogis to know how much [].
 
And so far, my budget needs, tape recorders, everything was sold out by [] we use, when we get to the part of it but I know that you do the account, otherwise not [].
 
 So I have done form that [commit u.][] on which only tapes  and audio tapes and my books and all those [equipment] so. Even my photographs , because we don’t want people to make money out of [re causes] gave you. It is [aco… ability  ]… it is very dangerous.
 
Moreover you don’t take projects , which you cannot afford . It is very important. you do not take projects , which cannot afford  never at all. Never take any project that you cannot afford.
 
So whatever you want to do with your private money [organize] any project anything you can do it. But if you want to use the money which is [donated/collected] for collective work , you must need the sanction of the collective and My sanction as well.
 
Now there is no [discussing ] Sahaja Yoga no [discussing]. You cannot mix up business in sahaja yoga , no money should []
 
But you become a sahaja yogi , you become very dynamic and you become extremely intelligent and you understand  and if you are going to [mis…] anything you start getting such a lot of money that you don’t not what to do with it.
 
And here an example of sahaja yogi who came to sahaja yoga. He is[…] and there was strike in [his company] about two years.
 
But you will be surprised that when he started his business with sahaja yoga, and  [main object]and his business absolutely[actually] separated he is [to come an ultimate the end]
 
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga if your business does not work out that [remove that ] you have done something great mistake otherwise it is [very imposible]
 
So you have to be extremely and ridiculously honest about public [finance]
 
Also you should not use any sahaja yogy for business. [] For example you may [come] many people from aboard. And you might say or they might say that you can do this do that all that. [it may work] it is very difficult
 
That means that we have to be understanding the blessings of Sahaja yoga and take full advantage of the blessings and prosper physically mentally emotionally and also finansially.
 
The power also  one should not assert or control that dangerous again.
 
[From the first year] I am be able with you and started Sahaja yoga. And my experience with human beings is that you have to be very sincere in Sahaja yoga.[] and [detectors] they call it  does not work out in sahaja yoga.
 
When you have vertical growth you have also horizontal growth.[one and this part]
 
And that all your problems get solved you don’t have get to worry but you have to be sincere and honest yourself.
 
So this is[means] your [own]pattern of sahaja yoga should be . As I told you Sahaja yoga you must know that I [send] here [doctor Bohdan] and so [fed up] here people power oriented and you must know that the things that we all mad here you divided here to Moscow . Leningrad Kiev – is quite absurd about it.
 
And such a nice man [Doctor Bogdan you…]who can work on the mental science as well and on other science and if people go on behave like this in Russia , we’ll finish off Sahaja Yoga.
And he came [.. do this] and I would request you [] most in Moscow and Leningrad and he will look after the Leningrad and everything. But try to understand [if this go on] [will to talk] and  I will talk to him. And you have to all[ put on  this guide ness] because he [was a boy] sahaja yogi good think of it…
 
So this is all about your [realization of it] applause… So the second part of this is a puja… 

Buddha puja part 2

The pujas are meant to awaken the deities within you which are on your centers.
Russsian translator: "probuzhdeni" [meaning "awakened]. 
Shri Mataji : All right. So, we do it. That eleven main pujas we have, eleven in the international level. But, here, I decided to have the Buddha puja, or Lord Buddha’s puja, because Russia is in the back, according to us, is the right Agnya, right side of Agnya, left and right. And that is why we are going to have the Buddha puja, which is, in a way, suggesting that puja means enlighten.
So there are three, three mantras of – in  the Buddhist, the Buddhist religion, they call it, or Buddha’s stotram. The first one is “Buddham sharanam gachami,” meaning “I surrender myself to all the people who are enlightened.” That case we have to respect each other. We are all enlightened souls. As I also bow to you, you have to bow to each other. So, we are to bow to all the people who are enlightened. And thus, we respect each other’s Self-Realization.
Now, there’s a way you could surely know about Namadeva. And he was a great poet, and a saint in Maharashtra. And this Namadeva went to see another realized soul who was a potter, potter, little pots. This - another one was called as Gura Khumar, Gura Khumar. Now the Namadeva thought that he was a seeker of a much higher state. So when he saw him, he was just mixing the clay with his feet. Though he stood absolutely stunned looking at Gura Khumar - Namadeva - for a minute and that just to touch his eyes and hands and bowed to him.
And he said that, “I came to feel here to see something that is formless, just to feel the vibrations, but here, it’s the formless [which] is in the form.” This is the appreciation of one Sahaja Yogi of another one. It is appreciation. But many people, many people can though [throw?], other people who are not Sahaja yogis, but not Sahaja Yogis themselves. So, one has to know that all of you are now in such a condition that you are all great yogis, and you all have to be respected. And nobody has to preserve [thou?].
Now, the explain of Agnya today of Aron, will give you a very big ascent, in the sense that this is the most difficult center. Now, you have, on the Agnya chakra itself, is bestowed upon us, is our Lord Jesus Christ. And that He is the one who is awakened sucks in our ego and superego, our Karmas and our conditionings.
So, this special thing is that we are worshiping a deity on the right Agnya which makes you think too much, first of all, and also it makes you aggressive, and also it makes you a very right-sided. By this worship, you will become very mild, very gentle, very beautiful people and you’ll be able to see things much more clearly.
Now this right side gives you a kind of a ego which troubles everyone, but you could never feel the trouble till you get into a very serious state. It gives you the overactivity of the brain and conscious mind works too hard. For that you are, you are not very hard working people, but you can see, first of all, that your mind is more active than your body. So, this Agnya chakra has to be controlled by Buddha, and that’s why we do puja today.
The second mantra is, “Dhammam sharanam gachami.” “Dhammam”. It means, “I surrender myself to my dharma.” Means, to my ten commandments, you can call them, or the ten valences that I have in my stomach.
Shri Mataji : [To the translator] “Valences”.
And, that is the second point that your dharma is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, is the pure, innate religion within you, pure innate religion. That means you have to look after your behavior and from that you judge yourself: “Why are you doing like this?” “You could not have done that.”
Now, this extreme of Agnya chakra has come up with a disease called as [?], and you will be surprised that I have told about this disease about 8 years back in America, that it should come, that your conscious mind will not be able to work anything, only you’ll live with the subconscious. [inaudible].
[Cut in the audio]
And you’ll be sick, because as long as you are walking unconsciously, you are alright. As soon as you think you are walking- you fall?
 Your conscious mind will not be able to work, Actually ??? aggressive, even if you get.
And our doctors are now trying experiments on them.
Who is stupidly pampering your ego? that “I have done this, I have done that.” But then, the ego sits on your head, and you will become completely lost, don’t know what to do.
So, today’s puja is very important for Russia, and for you people, because now you have got freedom and your Agnya can go out of balance. Now if you understand one thing, that when you get your freedom also you must learn how to bear the freedom. So it is indicated in the Sahaja yoga and I don’t want to frighten you, but, we have to be very careful with our Agnya, that’s what I just tell you, as I do not want to frighten you, but as Sahaja Yogi, it is not going to happen to you, but still you have to be very careful.
And now, we are going to have the puja, after this, and I hope you people will imbibe with the vibrations penetrated to you, you’ll find the change very much within you.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
