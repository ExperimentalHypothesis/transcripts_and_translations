1982-0705 Dr Singh Address London England DP-RAW

[00:48-00:52] Shri Mataji-- “They wanted to meet you so much. So, what happened here is”* they were going early in the morning “some of them”*. [00:58-01:05] “So, they said they will come there and meet you. So, I said”* that is going to be too much, “so early in the morning. So, I said we will stay back here.  We will go tomorrow morning. Many people have left.”* Sit down. And others are there please call them.

Sahaja Yogi-- They, they are coming, mother.

 [01:10-01:19] Shri Mataji-- “See, what a beautiful place is this.”*

SahajaYogi— “very beautiful place.”*

Shri Mataji-- “Complete upstairs and downstairs. Very beautiful. Now you will see my room also.”* Just call all of them. 

  [1:30-1:37] “All of them left in the morning. So, I stayed back because I thought they will come there to meet me, so this is better.”* 

All of them have come? [02:09-02:14] “Children also are also there, husband and wives are there. People have come from outside, from Spain.”* Where is that group from Spain?

Sahaja Yogi— [ Not clear].

I told them that he is coming. Why should they have gone?

Sahaja Yogi-- They will be back in a couple of minutes.

Shri Mataji-- Alright. Come forward.

Sahaja Yogi— [unclear question]

Shri Mataji--They will be back soon. Alright?

SahajaYogi--[ in audible}.

Shri Mataji-- Alright, alright. [02:39-02:43] “He is from Algeria. There are many people from Algeria, from France.”* He is better now. Much better. Sit down. Sit down. Some of you can come little forward if there is no space. 

Sahaj Yogi-- They won't be able to cross over, mother.

Shri Mataji-- What you want? eh? What do you want? Call Vaison. Call him. Call him. Mataji is calling him. call him. Is she all right now? Is she alright? [03:23-03:32] “All these are Sahaja Yogis. Very great saints and sages. He made a picture of Hanuman and showed us. Also Ganesha's.”* Show him your Ganesha. Show him your Ganesha, Vaison? Your Ganesha, you show me. where is it kept in his pocket. He has made all the paintings of Ganesha today. [03:54-03:57] “They are not able to understand. They roam around along with it.”* 

[04:01-04:14]  Sahaja Yogini-- “The one who wrote your book also is here?”* 

Shri Mataji-- “No, Gregoire, he left in the morning.”*

Sahaja Yogini—Ohhh!

 “He was here till 9 o'clock. He went off at 9 o'clock. One more Book has come,”* which is ... 

Sahaja Yogini-- “Was that his sister, who had come?”* 

Shri Mataji-- “Yes.”* 

Sahaja Yogini -- “Is she there?”*

Shri Mataji-- “She is there.”* She is gone also? Marila?  Is she? Marilla? Marilla? 

Sahaja yogi—[inaudible answer].

Shri Mataji--Marilla, call her.

Sahaja Yogini--She is changing the baby.

Shri Mataji -- Oh I see. Gregoir's, daughter, wife is here and child is here. Also ask them to come. Where is she? “That is her husband, Philip.”* Yeah, she is here. This is Gregoir's wife, “who sitting there.”* 

Sahaja Yogini—Ahhh!

Shri Mataji—Uhh!

Sahaja Yogini— “Looks like She has stayed back.”*

 Shri Mataji-- “Yes, she has stayed back. He has gone on work.”* Haan, come along. He is, he is the one. Come. Denise Ricardo. he has come from Chile here. Haan and yes, there are lots of people from Chile. But then because he knows Spanish he went to Spain, and we started a centre there, and now some people from Spain have come. Aah! This is the Ganesha. 

Sahaja Yogi--Very good, eh. Very Good.  Beautiful!

 Shri Mataji -- “All the time they are making this.”* 

Shri Mataji-- So, now we have among ourselves a very learned personality, Dr. Singh, and his very sweet wife. It is such a pleasure to have such people. His education, I dont know well, what he did really, but I feel that he is the epitome of perfection as far as Indian Philosophy is concerned. Because he has caught the essence of it. And as in yesterday’s names of the Guru, you learned that he has to be Vidha, he has to be Vidhwaana, that he should know. That it is not sufficient that you become realized souls. It is not sufficient at all. Because you have to be with others. If you just have to be individualistic, then it is alright to be just realized. But you have to know what it is. And for that you have to be a Vidhwaan, the one who has known all the knowledge. And his inquiry has led him to absolute right conclusions. And this is the thing that makes me surprised. Because normally, reading too much makes a person ego-oriented , diverted, misled. But his conclusions are absolutely at the right point. That has really impressed me so much. I haven’t seen any bureaucrat of his level, as far as spirituality is concerned. They may be intelligent, they may be well read, and all that. But to reach the right conclusions is only possible if you have innately built in within yourself, common sense based on wisdom. Is a sign of great wisdom to reach the right conclusions. And this is what I have found about him. He is very great. Though you are also very learned people, with PhDs sitting here, and all Oxfords and Cambridges, and this and that. All very educated, scholarly people also here. But all that scholarship, if it didn’t teach you the right thing, it doesn’t give you that capacity to reach the right conclusion, it is absolutely detrimental to your spiritual growth. Detrimental. It is not only useless, but it is detrimental. And this is something, such a great find for me. I was overjoyed to meet him.  There is another gentleman, as I told you, Dr. Nagen Singh, who is the same style of a person. He has not read much about Indian Philosophy and all that, but he also reached the right conclusions as far as Law is concerned. He studied Law. In the same way, in your education, if you can really reach that understanding, then one must know that education is based on wisdom and not on ego. That you are going to become something better than others and show off your knowledge. But that you yourself develop and grow with that wisdom. And that is why I am very proud of him and I want you all to listen to him. To his words of wisdom. May God Bless You all.

Would you like to stand Sir, or ...As you like. Would you be kind enough, because we have a limited amount of lead for the cord?

Where is Rustom gone. Call him.

Dr Singh--Your Holiness, Mataji and friends, I do not think I deserve what mostly Mataji has told you about me but what it shows is that I have earned so much affection from Her. I and my wife always talk about her, remember her as an embodiment of love, compassion and the desire to help everyone to uplift himself or herself. That is the great thing about her, and we are indeed very lucky to have someone who can give us insight into those areas of existence, about which unfortunately not only there is a great dearth at present, but also there is very little curiosity. Mataji has asked me to say something. I feel that I would put before you, how, I in my own thinking, have been able to understand what Mataji has been trying to teach. How I see Her teachings. That is what I would like to interpret to you in my own humble limited, manner. You are all very learned people, highly educated. So, I would like to talk to you in a language, which I hope you will appreciate.

We all know and believe that there are 3 levels of existence. One is what can be called the inorganic material level. Next to it is the organic or life level, the level of the living world. And above this world of life or living, is what can be crudely called a spiritual world. Crudely I said, for absence of no other name, some people call it spiritual world, some call it transcendental world or some call it the world of Atman or whatever the word you want to use, you can use. But these are the 3 levels. We also all believe that somehow or the other the 3 are connected. Somehow or the other, science also has shown how in organic matter at some stage, life evolves, erupts in organic matter. Science is in fact very close to unravelling that mysterious process through which matter, lifeless matter gets transformed into life. And I think time is not far, when the lowest constituents of life that is the cell, as it is called, could be manufactured through chemicals, inorganic chemicals, in a way which scientists want to manufacture it. When that stage will be reached, we would have known how to bridge the material and the living worlds. In the same way at a particular point, the world of the living, our life as it is which consists of our physical body, our brain, our thought processes, emotions, feelings, everything comes under there. That gets connected with the other world, the third level, which you can call the spiritual world. This unity everyone believes, but how it can be established, is yet a mystery. Now, what is the way to connect the living world with the spiritual world?

A very good answer, or I would say very good analogy, has been provided by looking at matter, inorganic matter. As you all know it is truism that first scientists thought everything is constituted of elements, basic elements who were the ultimate constituents of matter. Their number of elements started with small numbers and went on growing, growing, growing, till they reached around hundred. And then came the Nuclear Physics Age, when they went still further and found out that the difference between one element and another, consists of only the difference in nucleus of the atom of that element. The nucleus differs and then there are electrons moving around the nucleus and they constitute the difference between one matter and another. The Nucleus consisted of neutrons, protons; and the number of neutrons and protons which existed in a particular atom determined which element it was. But science reached a stage still, more, higher than this some years back. I think the last decade. They found out that if you move the nucleus of an atom, at a very fast speed, then the neutrons and protons, they also become electrons. So, they all become one, one energy, unified. And the machine is called Cyclotron. The physicists here may correct me wherever I go wrong. In a Cyclotron the atoms move so fast that the difference between molecules, between neutrons, protons, electrons, all disappears and they all become united. Become one. Just one. Take the element away from the machine, and they are different.

It is a similar kind of thing, which has to happen to make you as you are, to make us as we are, -consisting of mind, body and all that, get united with that other world, the spiritual world. When the difference disappears between the body, the cell, the thought and all that. The capacity to be united exists in us, in the same way as the capacity to become an electron, exists in their neutron and proton but, it is not moving, it is static. So, it is different. In the same way our body, our mind, because it is static, because it doesn’t move, it doesn’t have the capacity to move it doesn’t get connected to that world.

How to do it? Science has the machine, the Cyclotron. You also need that machine. What does that machine to do? It has to vibrate you, it has to shake you. And when it vibrates you, when it shakes you, then you also become like that charged particle underneath the atom. Then your differences disappear and unity is established. In the atom the dormant thing is the nucleus, which has got to be shaken. In us human beings, the dormant thing is, what is called the mysterious power of the kundalini. We all have that kundalini in us. That is that great power, residing in each one of us. The question is how to make it, how to shake it, how to vibrate it so that it moves and in moving it takes away your whole being, your whole psycho,  physical framework which you have, and connects it with that other world. It has got to be plugged in. That your this frame has got to be plugged into that big universal force. And once it is plugged in, you move, you vibrate and in that vibration the differences disappear. When you unplug it again, then like the nucleus of the atom, you are dormant. Only the electrons are moving. In the same way in you also, the movement is going on, as in the atom, the electrons are moving in tremendous speed and the nucleus is silent, dormant. In the same way in you also that force is moving, only you are not aware of it and you are not making use of it. What is needed is that you become aware of that force, then you make use of that force. And then you try to vibrate it. How can you vibrate? The scientists have the Cyclotron. You need a Cyclotron, that machine. Who is that machine? The machine is the guru. The guru is that machine. Once you get that guru, then you are yourself the machine. You have got the machine, and what is much more than that machine, you have got also the maker of the cyclotron is also there. The repairer of the cyclotron is also there. The modulator and the manipulator of the cyclotron is also there. So, if cyclotron goes wrong you have to take it to the laboratory, you need a repair man, the inventor, the maker. But no. Here the guru has all those things combined. So, he or she has to vibrate it. And the Sahaja Yoga is the system by which this vibration merging, putting you on the cyclotron, takes place in a manner which is in confirmity with your nature. It doesn’t need to bring anyone from outside. Doesn’t bring any force from outside.

You know we have in India, 3 main types of equipment. Let me call it equipment, to really vibrate you. These 3 are called tantra, mantra and yantra. These things, some people want tantra, others want mantra and some want yantra. Yantras, are things which are visible, seen. Which you can see in front of you. And when you see these things they create in your mind a certain kind of feeling, certain kind of thoughts arising in your mind which help you in getting this plugging done, which I talked about. Mantra is recitation. Recitation of certain, uh! certain rhymes, verses etc. When you make this, when you recite like this your palate, your, the throat and all these muscles; they vibrate in certain way. And now researchers are finding that when they vibrate that way, they do cause certain dormant parts of your brain to wake up. Then, that is the mantra. And the tantra is the body. You do various things with your body what is normally called yoga, asanas, postures and doing all those things by which your body get in such a way attuned, in such a way that  plugs you in with the spiritual world. But beyond all these things is just the simple yoga, where you first know what you are. You know what the spiritual power in you is. Then with the help of your guru you try to have that vibration, to have that agitation. You can call it transcendental agitation if you want by which you get attuned and you get plugged in.

Scientists say that our brain is roughly known about 1/3- 1/4 is known and about 2/3 is unknown. And there is this scientist whom I met in Spain. He has a theory. He says the unknown part which constitutes most of our brain, has 2 parts. Half of it relates to the future, half related to the past. Half of this has all those things stored, programmed and stored like you have in a computer. If you have microfilmed history of the past 5000 years. So, it has your entire past programmed, microfilmed and kept in half of it, and some day if you can awaken it, then you know the past, you know what ever has happened. Whatever your psycho-physical system has encountered during your existence in previous lives, will become known to you. And half of it deals with future. Future means, future is nowhere. Future, the reality as it is it just is, is only present, neither past nor future. So that gives you the capacity to know everything as it is today. We have only to awaken those powers and those powers can be awakened only by this communication, by which the vibration reaches your, your that brain. So, this is as I see, the Sahaja Yoga. And you are lucky and fortunate. We are all lucky and fortunate that we have saints like Mataji, who have not only realized and seen these connections from bottom going above, but who have the compassion to make others also see that. And you are involved in that great adventure. You are all doing the same work which those scientists have done, who found the interconnection between one matter and another, between the atom and the nucleus. Those who got and built the cyclotron because you all can become like Mataji. So many hundreds and thousands of cyclotrons and you, each one of you creates many more. And that is the way the world has to evolve. Because this is my feeling, I may be wrong that this whole universe is a sport of the almighty.

He, as a child, takes small blocks of wood, builds them into a beautiful building. He knows that he only enjoys building that block into buildings, putting them, those blocks. He knows these are blocks and he knows when I make them this kind of thing will come. He has no other purpose. He does it and He shakes them again and builds them again. The same way I think these are the Almightys has all of us here as living beings, as many others, which are just plants. There are many others things which are just inorganic matter. If he wishes everyone, everything, we even the tiniest piece of earth will become like you and me. But He doesn’t wish it in the same way as a child who is building the block. He wants one stone to be only the foundation, he wants the other block only to go on top, why? Because it is his wish. It is his enjoyment. So, there are no whys in this. There is no purpose in it. Otherwise someone can say why did he not make everyone as a conscious human being? Why some are plants only? why something is only stone or mud? Ask that child why have you put this stone here why have you put that block there? Why have you put this? Why are you building the building here and not there? This is my wish. Only thing is he is an omnipotent child. He is an omnipotent child. No mother to scold him, no, no limitation, no dearth of toys, no dearth of blocks. And his blocks are living also. This child has to put the blocks one above the other, he only wishes and the blocks get placed one above the other. So, this is how I look at it but the same almighty in the form of saints and sages. We are his part tells the, gives the capacity to them to make so many other of those blocks, which are not fully alive as living blocks. Some which are living, the teacher as desired by the almighty can make fully conscious, can make realized, as such is His wish. We are lucky as human beings, that we have that capacity. And we are also lucky that we get the masters who teach us. With these few words I would like to express my gratitude to all of you for listening to me. And Mataji has been so kind and affectionate to me, my wife and my children that to thank her would be a crude formality. Thank you very much.

Sahaja Yogi-- I am not quite so tall as our dear ambassador friend. It is so lovely to welcome somebody from the world of, that world which I touched a little, but which I found a little too difficult to handle at the time. Mr. ambassador we respect you, we understand what Mataji said when she referred to that great learning and wisdom which lies beneath that learning. It is very rare in the west particularly, to, to meet with and to hear the words of somebody in as senior position as yourself, giving such a profound and I may say touching explanation of the deeper aspects and the philosophy of human existence and the aspiration of human existence. The way in which you gave the analogy, within the field of science, to that the atman and the kundalini has given us a lot of food for thought. We now have a new approach to talk to our seekers. We now have a new dimension to open up because these things do matter, sir. that we should reach seekers that we should be able to relate to them in that terms that we should be able to talk about modern science about modern philosophy, in words that they can understand where, as you spoke of that force that lies within us, the kundalini being liken to those other energies that lie within scientific terminologies. You have given us a whole new vocabulary if I may say so. And for that we thank you. Within the world of diplomatic and commercial counselling this field, to have somebody as profound and with such understanding of the things of the spirit, as you have sir, is such a joy. A joy to us because we have found in touching our spirit, the joy that comes of sharing with others and becoming one with the whole. This becoming one with the whole is something which we all have been seeking, perhaps, over in many many lives. And when we touch it, we say this is it, this is it. This is what we have been seeking. And with utter dismay and complete joy like little children as you said, when we touch it we think my goodness all of these highways and byways that we have been going on, all of these learning processes, all of these PhD’s, all of these, MA.Ds! remedies, that is not it. A little bit like Socrates, not this, not this, not this; and then when you find it, this is it. And this is what you sir, have found and were able to put it in such eloquent words. How you in fact, not only have found it but expressed it in your words and in your heart. We feel the vibrations of the universe, we feel the chaitanya that was referred to as Chaitanya Lahiri by Adi Shankaracharya. We feel the brahma shakti as vibrations. We have been given this blessing by Mataji Nirmala Devi and unlike in the past you referred to gurus, unlike in the past it is a little curious at the moment because, I suppose you can say the divine is overflowing with its desire to bring all the seekers, to that state of consciousness, to that state of realization to which  you were referring. So, the outpouring of the divine is a mass happening today. It is something which is taking place all over the world, there are groups of seekers, there are masses of people who just want to become the silent atma, they want to become one with the divine, and Mataji is an integrating force. She is a force which, gives that awakening en mass. You’d be interested to know that I was with the party with Mataji in India when we visited this whole village of Maharashtra of Kadus, and before that audience of not a few hundred but 6000 people, every single one of those people felt the vibrations. The divine is giving this experience en-mass. We don’t ask who Mataji is, we don’t ask what She is. We don’t quite know whether She is guru, whether She  is this or that. To us She has given us the blessing, as you referred to in the end of your remarks, not only does She patch up the little problems, not only is that the quality of the guru, not only does She fix up things, does She soothe, does She balance up the little imbalances that has happened within us, but more than that, She teaches us to be our own guru and this is the ultimate blessing. How many of these gurus in the Himalayas, in the mountains, how many of these gurus have had the power to be able to give the realization just by the desire to do it, by raising that force within us. How many of those have been able to do it? We are in a very privileged position. I don’t know how we ended up in this incarnation, to be in such a privileged position, is to be able to go to a program, here in this ashram or may be out in some meeting of people in the suburb of London or coming to Madrid or wherever it was. To be able to give realization en-mass to people. And we say I am giving realization, and then we think, no it is not I who is giving realization, this is the power that we’ve got. It is an amazing enigma within us that this power which we know as kundalini, which vibrates which touches the atma, which puts us in touch with the all- pervading power of god. It works, we can maneuver it. We can monitor the chakras that you know very well. We can monitor the chakras on our fingertips. We can know where the kundalini is sitting, if there is a little blockage, we have the capacity to clear those little blockages and allow the kundalini to rise. In fact is very interesting in India where people may be don’t have their shirts on, and they bend before Mother’s feet and we can watch the kundalini rising. And we can watch it pulsating at a certain chakra, where there is a little obstruction and by giving it a bandhan, saying perhaps a mantra, kundalini will move very quickly and we can watch it as a wave, a physical energy rising through the spine and you can see with your own eyes this happening. These things are amazing to us. Because as you well know, living in the west that we are a very rational beings, we do use a very mechanical, scientific brain to achieve certain conclusions. But as Mother has said and you Sir, reinforced, how do you reach the right conclusion is the thing. How do you reach the right conclusion? How as an ambassador to Spain, working for the bureaucracy of the India, to reach this conclusion that you have sir? How to do it? This is the spiritual power that lies within you. This is the power of discrimination which we have been given.

...such and such, or we said that by paying some money to those such and such course, you could do this or do that, or by perhaps even certain austerities and you know the thing, Sir.  It is not like that with Mother. It just happens in a twinkle of the eye, especially for people whose chakras are in good condition. In fact, in some people the experience is very, very strong, and the force of Kundalini is so great that these vibrations just bathe the whole body as if like a fountain from the top of the head. And it is a very beautiful experience. Inside we become silent. Absolutely silent. You have the quality of Shri Shiva. The quality of silence. The quality of the witness. We become all the deities that have taken birth, either in the Virat, or on this earth. We become Shri Ganesh and the wisdom of Shri Ganesh. We become the quality of evolution that was Shri Vishnu. We become Brahma Deva and Saraswati, the knowledge and wisdom of creation. We become the security of the Atma. We become part of the great Primordial being, which is Shri Krishna and Radha.  We become the eternal spirit which was Lord Jesus Christ. And now the time has come when Mataji has taken Her birth, and we become a part and parcel of the whole. It is just such a logical, beautiful thing to happen. And it is with such joy and such fulfilment that we go up to the seekers of the world, no matter how damaged they are. Never mind if they have been to false gurus. Never mind if they have been to this or that person who practises black magic, or whatever it is. Never mind these things. We tell them about, you’ve got to get it now. It is here. It is available. And It is an actualisation that can happen in your own awareness. And when it happens, the fulfilment, the transformation, the change in your whole being, is just so joy giving, and yet one becomes so silent, so peaceful. Your physical pains and problems disappear. All of these things just happen in a twinkling of the eye. If they do not happen immediately, we know the technique, the yantra, the tantra I think it is. Correct! The tantra, and how to work it out. Technique of the divine.

Shri Mataji-- “They know all about the three technique yantra, tantra and mantra.”*  They know all that.

We’ve been given the experience. We have been shown how to do it. I can only say Sir, the wisdom that you’ve expressed from within, which has come from the great qualities of Dharma, the great qualities of family life in India; the great qualities of the ancient philosophies of India, which you just expressed, as a natural thing, gives us tremendous joy. Because now, we having found it, we now feel at one with you, and together we feel that we can transform this world. Not that we are doing it, but that we become the instruments for that transformation. Thank you again Sir, for that absolutely profound expression of your own divinity and your own experience, and how we have enriched in our awareness from what you have had to say.  Thank you very much.

Shr iMataji—[first line unclear]. Somehow they have become great orators. Now as a token of their love, They want to present this photograph of mine. [inaudible].  And For her.

The Lady—why all this?

Sri Mataji—I must tell you she is a great writer herself. [two lines not clear]. And I told her that she should stsrt writing for Sahaja Yoga.

[Unlear conversation between yogis and Shri Mataji].

Shri Mataji--  [53:20- 53:34] “The importance of India is about to grow. We have to get to the roots of it.”* 

Sahaja Yogini-- “Which roots?”*

Shri Mataji-- “The day has come, when the India's importance will grow. It is evident. But,”* the confusion comes in, at a point where spiritual life is actually, can be camouflaged. This is the confusion. You see, where, where an Indian mind is like a Sagitarius, you see, it hits the point. Is there, it is said. I mean, not that in the Indian shastras it is not described. Adi Bhowtik and Adi Daivik, is described. I mean, it is not that it is not described. And the Adi Bhowtik is the thing what we call as the Collective Sub Conscious, and Adi Daivik is the Collective Supra conscious. So that is the point where people can get diverted. And that is the advantage the false gurus have, that they put you on to the Adi Daivak or Adi Bhowtik areas, and you think it is unknown, so it is God. It is not. So, the confusion is there in between. From the physical to the spiritual, this confusion throws you either to the right or to the left, and that’s how you get confused. But for an Indian mind, who is wise, he sees things straight through. For him it is not important if somebody gives him a diamond, or makes a something, or gives him a big lecture on dharma and things. This is, we have had enough of it. Perhaps the traditional life in India has taught them. Whatever it is. But they see through straight that it cannot be this, and this is the only trouble you all have faced through going to wrong gurus.  But your urge was so great and you have tremendous urge, I must say there a word for these people, that their urge is much greater than that of Indians. No doubt. But it is like somebody has teeth so they dont have the channa to eat; and somebody has the channa so they dont have the teeth. And they have the wisdom to see it. If these two things also integrate, 

Shri Mataji-- You garland him.

I have told them that whenever they want, they can always come and stay in your Ashram, and they will be very happy to look after you. Of-course it is a privilege for me to have them in My house, and I enjoy their company very much, and their love. But I have already invited them on your behalf.

Sahaja Yogi-- Their children will be most welcome here.

Shri Mataji-- Yes. Your children will be most welcome. [56:51- 57:37] “whenever there is a problem, you send the children here, and tell them to keep coming here. Here, everything is there. One minute, you see and all of you have your tea. For a minute you see, then.. Ok, for you, are you going anywhere in the evening? Doctor sahab is going anywhere? Meaning, call them there, for your diabetes, at your home? Whenever you are free, all will come there. The doctor saheb of this place can be called.”* 

Sahaja Yogini— “Dr. Sahab?”*

Shri Mataji-- “yes, whenever. What time will you be at home? Here. Shall we call him at night? During the daytime are you going to the office?”*

Yogini— “Will you be going to Office?”*

Shri Mataji-- “You will not be going right?”* 

Yogini -- “No, I am not going.”* 

Shri Mataji-- “OK then we can take them there. Rustom, you and Dr Warren come with us.”* 

Sahaja Yogi-- “Ok.”* 

[57:46- 58:05] “This also is God given, look up.”*

 “This we have got free of cost.”* 

Yogini-- “How did you get free of cost?”*

Shri Mataji-- “We got it. that is the thing. We created Sahaja yoga Co-opt. So, they said, you don't get it for 10-10 years, 20 years, where is this going to happen?”* Within a week we got a big restaurant, no a hotel, hotel. Then they said this hotel is to be demolished, alright. So, we got this, is even better than that.

Sahaja Yogi—umhum!

Shri Mataji-- How many bedrooms you have?

Sahaja Yogi—[unclear answer]

Sahaja Yogini--  [58:36-58:42] “Who is here all the time?”*

Shri Mataji-- “All of them live here, stay here only. Not all of them. But many.”* How many of you are here now, staying?

Sahaja Yogi—[unclear]

 Shri Mataji-- No no no, just now. But what I am saying, altogether. “All these have come from outside.”* Permanently those who live here, how many?

Sahaja Yogi—That may be 25-26.

 Shri Mataji-- 25-26. [58:59- 59:14] “Meaning, married couples are there and those with children also are there. There are big rooms and bedrooms.”*

 Yogini-- “Boarding and lodging everything is there?”* 

Shri Mataji-- “Yes, everything is here.”*

Yogini— “meaning mess etc are there?”*

 Shri Mataji-- “Mess is there, food is there. They prepare food here. Wait for a minute I will show you. See the lower portion.”* Ok I tell you, [59:17- 59:27] “please take the cake. These people have made it themselves. Take at least one of them. I guess you will not take anything. Take this. This  Savoury. See. This is savoury.”*

Yogini-- “I will eat this. This is enough for me.”* 

Shri Mataji-- “Ok.”* she doesn't eat sweet things. 

Shri Mataji—what is he saying?

Yogis  laugh.

[ 1:00:33- 1:00: 1:00:50] “There are many people from Switzerland. She was the headmistress of Switzerland. People of all age group are there.”* 

Yogini— “Give him channa.”*

Shri Mataji-- Let him sleep. “He always comes in front of me and sleeps. He is always in merriment. That is a state right?”* It is a question of state. “He is in a state, where there is no enquiry for anything. He is avadhoot. He is sustained in that state. Vincent is his name.”* What is his name, Indian name, What is? 

Sahaja Yogini-- Surya.
