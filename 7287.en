Shri Mataji: So, thank you very much for the nice weekend.
Sahaja Yogis: Thank you very much, Mother.
Shri Mataji: We really want to thanks. I wish you could send your hands to [unclear]. Really [unclear] how beautiful it was. All right?
May God bless you.

[Laughter]
[To the infant girl] I am sorry, I have to go by this walk. You have to go by which one? That one.
Girl: Can I help you [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: But we are going with [Unclear name] to. All right? And he [the father] has to drive his own car. All right, bye, bye!

All right. May God bless you all. Thanks these people very much. They have been very kind to us.

Sahaja Yogi: The river, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: There are seven springs of Thames.
Shri Mataji: Now, one thing.
Sahaja Yogi: Be careful.
You see, there is one, two, three.
Shri Mataji: Four. Five
Sahaja Yogi: Three, four.

There’s a lot of running today.
[Unclear conversation].

Sahaja Yogi: This one has actually sand. This one here, further.

Sahaja Yogi: Three, four, five, six.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, six.

[Sahaja Yogi are taking water from the sources and poor it in Shri Mataji’s hand]

Sahaja Yogi: Can we drink it?
Sahaja Yogi: Let’s see.
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, no.
This is the third one, the third spring.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]. Be careful.
Do you think it’s not going to be?
[Unclear conversation]
It’ all right, just take.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s Latin.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, there’s something written on the -
Shri Mataji: And that is one of that closing target [unsure].
Rustom: Yes, that is there.

Sahaja Yogi: You see, it’s Latin here.
Rustom: It means Father Thames. Here are seven fountains [unsure].
Shri Mataji: Seven?
Rustom: Fountains.
Thames, they call ‘father Thames’.
Shri Mataji: Ah, God the Father. But what’s the meaning of Thames?
Rustom: I can’t say.
Sahaja Yogi: It means Isis [name of the Goddess-queen of Egypt]. It’s used to be Isis.
Sahaja Yogi: Still the Isis or anyone from Oxford, they still call it the Isis.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Rustom: In Oxford, the Thames is called the Isis. That is one of the Devi’s name. [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: Tomorrow.
[Unclear conversation]

Now the flow has started. It has started. You see the movement has started.
Rustom: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: Definitely.
Rustom: It’s something like Kundalini awakening.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
See, flow has started.
[Unclear] And with this water, you’ll never get anything. No [unclear] There is nothing. They never get into [unclear] digestion. Surprisingly.
Rustom: We take off, all of us take our shoes off.
Shri Mataji: Keep your feet there and you’ll feel very nice.

Water must rise.

Sahaja Yogi: So cool.

Shri Mataji: See the vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: It is rising.
Shri Mataji: It rises [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: It has a very different smell.

All these things will go away if it [unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: Bolo Shri Ganga Mata Nirmala Devi ki! Jay!

Shri Mataji: Shri Thames Mata.
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Thames ki! Jay!
Shri Mataji: Mata.
Rustom: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: Now she’s happy. Ah! See the cool breeze coming! See the cool breeze coming. [Name unclear], are you feeling the cool breeze now? She said, "Dhanyavaad" [thank you in Hindi]. She is happy. Nobody has respected her, poor thing.
Sahaja Yogi: Now, we’ll respect.
Shri Mataji: You see? Cool Breeze is coming.

Rustom: Robert, how many people are there here?
Robert: Here? I have to count.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

Shri Mataji: All of you, all of you have a meaning, after all. Great meanings.
Sahaja Yogi: That river has become power.

Shri Mataji: As fountain, it is connected. It has started, quite a bit.
Sahaja Yogini: Is that a river [unclear] of those?
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, of course. It does. It takes away your badhas, everything. Wash your hands at least.
Sahaja Yogini: And it will stick in it too [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: Thirty-five.
Girl: It’s cool.

Sahaja Yogi: Thirty-five people.

Sahaja Yogi: Seven per five.
Shri Mataji: 35 crore. 35 crore Devatas.
Sahaja Yogi: What does that mean?
Rustom: There are 35 times 10 million Devatas in the universe. That is 35 times 10 million.

Shri Mataji: 35 crore, one crore is equal to
Sahaja Yogi: 10 million.
Shri Mataji: 10 million, you see.
Sahaja Yogi: And you? How did they count you, Mother?
Sahaja Yogi: That’s an impossibility.

Shri Mataji: That is, some say that it’s 33. They say 33.
Rustom: But some say 35.
Shri Mataji: 35.
Sahaja Yogi: And in the Devi Bhagavat, it’s what?
Shri Mataji: 35.

Shri Mataji: Peace has settled down.
Do we go?
[Unclear conversations]

Rustom: [Unclear ] attention must go away from [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Ah? Now, yes. [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Take her down. Take her down carefully, because she might not, she should not help.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi her grand-children].

Shri Mataji: Can somebody carry her in the laps? [Hindi]
Just somebody should take her down.
I think Alan can do it. [Hindi] Alan?
Just take her down. Let her, put in the water.
Sahaja Yogi: We counted her. She was there.
Shri Mataji: She was there? No, she was not there.
Sahaja Yogi: We counted 36.
Shri Mataji: She has to go. You didn’t count her? Doesn’t matter. She was not supposed to be at that time. [Laughter]
Sahaja Yogi: That’s OK.
Girl: Nany? Nany? [Hindi]
Rustom: It’s very cool.
Shri Mataji: Very soothing. All left is waking up like this, water.

Sahaja Yogi: I think they went to the tourist function.
Shri Mataji Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: I think they went to a tourist tour.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see there tourism is interesting. But I think this is the greatest tourism. [Shri Mataji does a bandhan]
No, no, but [unclear name] didn’t come.
They should be, because they understand the meaning, you see, of that part. [Shri Mataji laughs] She thinks that, "Now, I have become an actress or what? "
Sahaja Yogi: You are the movie star of movie stars, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, you move the stars.

Shri Mataji: Ok now someone, just look after her, she should not put on her necklace somewhere [unsure].

Nick: Yes, sure.
Sahaja Yogi: Could you give this to-

Sahaja Yogi: We’re going.
Did you take the stone of Mother?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. I have a photograph.
Sahaja Yogi: You took it with you, did you?
Sahaja Yogi: No.

Sahaja Yogi: I just try to find if you can see the seven sources.

Sahaja Yogi: Did Mother stand on this one here?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. The two there.
Sahaja Yogi: This one here.
Sahaja Yogi: Two.

[Shri Mataji is waiting in the car,, sitting in the front]

Sahaja Yogi: Just get one [photo].

[Cars drive back]

[Arrived at Pittville Pump Room].

Shri Mataji: You’ve never been here.
Sahaja Yogi: I have never come to [unclear] the before.
Shri Mataji: So, let’s find out. They’ve got a beautiful garden.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, it’s beautiful lake [unclear], Mother.
Shri Mataji: Is it? There’s a beautiful lake there. Just find out.
Sahaja Yogi: I am going?
Shri Mataji: Just find out. See the place.

Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] So, they are repairing it.
Shri Mataji: [unclear] Just can’t see the water flowing or anything?
Sahaja Yogi: No Mother. [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: What sort of an arrangement they have? Make bandhan.
[Shri Mataji does a bandhan] You can’t see anything there?
Sahaja Yogi: They make this building [unclear].
Shri Mataji: So?
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: There’s a tap there.
Sahaja Yogi: But they actually have to electrically pump it outside the ground.
[Cut in the video]

Shri Mataji: It’s nice here, you see. Better. What’s that?
[Unclear conversation]
[Laughter]

So happy, he? So exciting lights. You see the dome.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, there are 36 flowers.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: 36 flowers.
Shri Mataji: Yes, there are 36, all right? [Unclear]
[Laughter]

[Unclear conversations]

Beautiful really.

Cool. Very meditative. You see, the vibrations are coming. It was really nice.
Gavin: It was beautifully cool on the river.
Shri Mataji: Hum.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: It’s sulphur that is crawling in the water. It will never permeate. I mean, vibrations are coming [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, this is the hall we were going to have for a meeting at one time.
Shri Mataji: You are going to have?
Sahaja Yogi: We were going to have this one, one time.
Shri Mataji: When?
Sahaja Yogi: For this meeting you had last night. This is the one we wanted.
Shri Mataji: Ah! That would be great. Next time, you’ll have it.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yesterday, he was worried [unclear].
[Laughter]. It was like you having a pistol [unsure] With five of them from [unclear].
See, the [unclear] is variety, that’s what they do.

Gavin: It does the same effect on the brain cells.
Shri Mataji: Just [unclear] How many suffer [unclear]
Shri Mataji: The worst thing that I have seen is that, those who go to them, feel they are wise. But then they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think they are [unclear].
Gavin: That’s it.
Mataji: This is the thing I tell you, isn’t it?
How could it be that he was [unclear]? I just don’t understand at all. I said it. Not you Robert, so many others. Not you, you are not like that. But must be some reason. They asked doctor Vijay, I said, "How were you so much subjugated? You should have asked questions". He said, "No, they said that this is to kill your ego".

Sahaja Yogi: So you have to go out of the mind. That’s the answer.
Shri Mataji: They are very frank and honest, isn’t it? Be out of your mind. But they do not understand the world. Like, they say, "God [unclear] ", it means hell!

Sahaja Yogi: The entrance of the center where I went, you know, there was a paper. They put, "Please take off your shoes and your mind. Leave your shoes and mind outside the door".
Shri Mataji: You see that means, they want to say that we don’t send the mind. But that is what they would like to say, you see, but they have not explanation. They are trying to say, "Follow us", explaining that you transcend the mind, you are beyond mind. So they say that, "You keep your mind outside".

"And take out your shoes", you see, people are very attached to shoes. So, you see, they become nervous when they take out their shoes. Keep them outside.
There is a saying in Marathi, " [Marathi]". means, you get into the temple, but all your attention is on your shoes which are left behind. Because in India, it is very common if you lose them. When they have to go to a temple, they buy something, they have, they wear something that is absolutely useless, which they want to get rid of. Because in the temple, shoes are stolen. Or they replace their - [Shri Mataji speaks about what is happening around; unclear]

Shri Mataji to a baby: Hello! Hello, hello.

[Hindi conversation with grand-daughters]

Where is Olympia? And Gavin?

Girl: Nany, he is trying to get up.

Shri Mataji: Hum. Better. Let’s go now. Nick?
Gavin: Just check that he hasn’t come out.
Sahaja Yogi: He is just coming.
Shri Mataji: What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]. He has a telephone call.

[Unclear conversation aside]

Shri Mataji: This could have been a very good place here. [Unclear] next time. How far are you from here, Bristol?
Sahaja Yogi: Bristol? Yes. It’s [unclear]
Shri Mataji: One hour.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, they just wondered why we are sitting here.
Shri Mataji: What?
Gavin: They just wondered why we were sitting here, Mother.
[Laughter]
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, they wondered why we were all sitting here.
Shri Mataji: So, what did you say?
Sahaja Yogi: I said we were just waiting to see the water and drink it. Just waiting to see the water.
Shri Mataji: What did they say?
Sahaja Yogi: They said, “That’s all right.”
[Laughter]
Gavin: If there is any chance to do that?
Shri Mataji: They bring the water.
Sahaja Yogi: Hum. They didn’t say it’s going to be ready. They’re trying. They’re trying.
Gavin: We can hear the pump going, that’s all. Could you, can you just check? Because the pump is actually, there’s thumping in the wire.
Shri Mataji: Make a bandhan, maybe.

What’s that?

Sahaja Yogi: That’s where the water actually comes back from there.
Shri Mataji: On top?

Sahaja Yogi: It used to be- they used to be- in 1830, they used to pump it up by hands. Handing things, they used to pump it that way. But now it’s completely electric.
Sahaja Yogi: Where did it come up?
Sahaja Yogi: There’s nothing to see, honestly.
[Unclear conversation aside]

Shri Mataji: You get in charge of another baby. Hello? Olympia? You see, you see there. Machindranath. You see Machindranath?
Olympia: Machindranath.
Shri Mataji: Where is he?
Immediately, mellow down [unclear] brother or sister.

It’s coming up?
Sahaja Yogi: A trick. It’s a trick.
Gavin: That was actually just taken up from the tap, not from the pump. There’s a little tap there, he just took it from the tap. So, it wasn’t this.
Shri Mataji: Only, you see, there must be also calcium in it, must be sulphur, as you have this cushion [unsure] soil here. In that thick, you get this cushion [unsure] soil.
Gavin: Yes, yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: It’s like that.

In 10 minutes, we leave.
[Conversation with children.]
You see, he likes that way. He likes to be in that condition

[Hindi conversation with the girls]

Shri Mataji: Now, they’ve got the water. All right.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] spots in it.
Shri Mataji: It might be again sulphur. Yes, sulphur. Sulphur., it’s correct. No, no, it's correct. It’s absolutely good.
It's sulphur.
Gavin: Mother was telling this is sulphur, cold healing. Anybody who has got a cold liver, it’s a left Nabhi, problem.
Shri Mataji: You see, yellow colour, is suggesting [unclear], suggesting that yellow colour and all, that it is good for liver that is sleepy. Like carrots could be very good also.
And all that white colour contains vitamin A. Mostly white colour has vitamin A. Because calcium, you see. Calcium is white. Sulphur is yellowish. So, that’s the sign it is good for the [unclear] liver. But calcium is also very good for people who are having a cold liver. Calcium is good. It’s very good, especially for children who have got allergies, you can give them calcium, it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogini: Could you please explain what you mean about cold liver?
Shri Mataji: You see, we have got a liver which is overactive and one which is absolutely inactive. The one which is overactive is of that people who think too much, plan too much, liverish. And those who are inactive are the people who have an inactive temperament, or sort of those who develop allergies, more on the left-hand side. You see, that type.
So those who have allergies, should take to sulphur, this is good for them. And for the right-sided people, it’s better to take to cooler things. Like you can say, sugar. Sugar is very cooling. Sugar is a cooling.

Rustom: Mother, for people who are anxious and have too much nerves problems, they take these yellow flowers, marigold type. And they make tea out of it, fresh plants. I tried it in [unclear].
Shri Mataji: For nervous people.
Rustom: Ah. And also it has an effect on the liver ticking [unsure]
Shri Mataji: A ticking liver.
Rustom: It’s all made of ‘jada’ [laziness].
Shri Mataji: Yes, marigold. Marigold, the one which is yellowish colour. That’s good for liver, still.
Rustom: For gallstones –
Shri Mataji: Nervous people are mostly the people who are left-sided.
Rustom: Ah. But for gallstones and all that, it might help.
Shri Mataji: Yes, gallstones.
Rustom: But I know, sometimes I take it, it all comes out. [Unclear].about 3 or 4 [unclear].
Shri Mataji: That could be very good.

Gavin: And also, jasmine tea helps.
Shri Mataji: Jasmine tea is very good.
Gavin: It’s yellowish too.

Shri Mataji: If you go around, there is no water available.
I’ve had water. So, all of you have to take ticket. It’s very little available.

[Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Ganges river, you see, go anywhere, wherever river Ganges goes you will never find these dirty things.
Sahaja Yogi: [unclear] river Ganga comes from the snow and it goes past many flowers and herbs in the meantime.
Sahaja Yogi: And it also picks up all sort of elements and it mixes in the Ganges.
Shri Mataji: It’s [unclear] in the Sahasrara of Shiva.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, we are going to have a havan there, and the people to come [unclear] the Jewish ego. We have some plans Mother. Like saying Jewish hymns, singing and also the Lord’s prayer to confuse them and Mataji’s mantra.

[Unknown writer of this summary]
This video is not like the usual talk that we see at programmes and pujas, it is a beautiful day in our Mother’s life where she goes on an outing with her children. We will endeavour to share this journey together.....
There were thirteen Yogis and Yoginis with Shri Mataji which She said represented the 13 crore powers of the Devi.
This video begins with Shri Mataji thanking all the Yogis for a lovely weekend as they prepare to leave...as Shri Mataji sits in her car, all her children see her off with music...all the cars began their journey with Mother.
Upon arrival, Yogis helped Shri Mataji walk down to the stone area where there are seven sources, small almost puddle areas...like the beginning of a stream.
A Yogi takes a little water and places it in Mother’s hand. Shri Mataji stands on a stone where a Yogi offers the water to Her Holy Lotus Feet. Everybody is explaining to Shri Mataji how part of the river is called The Isis which flows through Oxford.
Shri Mataji is walking barefoot over this whole area...placing her Divine Lotus Feet in the water....the Yogis also join her. All the Yogis hail ‘Shri Ganga Mata Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai’
Shri Mataji then asks the Yogis ‘are you feeling the cool breeze now?’
The Yogis reply in agreement and Mother explains that we have said Jai to her so she is happy...nobody has respected her...
The Yogis reply that now she will be respected....
Shri Mataji is saying ‘see now the cool breeze is coming’. Everybody stand with Mother receiving the cool vibrations for a while.
As Shri Mataji and the Yogis head back to their cars, Mother walking barefoot, she speaks in hindi to the young ladies with her...’this a very pure place, the birth place of River Thames, so clear and cool.... go and put your feet in the water.
So cool and very soothing....all the left is clearing....Shri Mataji is taking bandhan on her left hand while talking so lightly and joyfully with each other.
As Shri Mataji settles back in her car, the Yogis and Yoginis are taking a little time at the source bowing and honouring the earth and water. They try to decipher words on the wall which include the words ‘Father Thames’...
Everybody return to their cars and prepare to continue the journey.....the convoy travel through the country roads until they reach the town.
They go into a beautiful building and sit together in a room with a dome ceiling made in the pattern of 36 flowers, which Shri Mataji is admiring. Mother is saying it is very meditative and vibrations are coming. A Yogi is telling Mother that this was the hall where they were going to have a meeting but couldn’t. Mother was so happy to hear this, she said that would be great, maybe next time...(machinery sounds as it seems there is work in progress)
Shri Mataji and the Yogis are talking about the effects of going to false gurus....She mentions how they mesmerise people. Mother spoke ‘there must be some reason, I asked Raktabeeja, how were you so much subjugated? You should have asked questions. She said no, they say this is to kill your ego’
They continue to talk and Mother explains a saying in Marathi which when translated means that when people go into the temple, they have to take shoes off outside so they will be in the temple but the attention is on the shoes outside!
Shri Mataji and the Yogis are enjoying the children and the little Ganeshas...
The building administrators were asking a Yogi why everybody was sitting there and Mother asked what he replied. The Yogi told them that they were waiting to see the water....
While waiting, a Yogi offered Mother a little water from a small tap and She confirmed the sulphur quality in the water. Mother continued to explain how sulphur is good for the liver and allergies. Calcium is very good especially for children with allergies. Shri Mataji continues to discuss the left and right...cool and warm effects. Yellow flowers and teas are good for the left ....sulphur is also good for gallstones. This water would not ferment.
Shri Mataji also put her attention on Scotland and said that they were enjoying their own destruction and what to do. She said she would create some disaster.
After this, there was an article about the water that was used to make a particular whiskey in Scotland, now contained sulphur so could no longer be used to make that alcohol.
They talked about the River Ganges....the water will always stay pure and clean, whereas other tap water etc will start to spoil after a while....as can be seen when you fill up a bottle.
The Ganges comes from the snow of the Himalaya and passes through many elements. Shri Mataji adds that it comes from the Sahasrara and Shiva.
Shri Mataji and the Yogis leave the building and the day ends with talking about havan plans as they see Mother to her car.
Blessed is this land and the river that has been touched by the Holy Feet of Our Divine Mother.
