H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi visits the source of the River Thames, near Cheltenham (England), 31 July 1982.
location: Seven Springs, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL53 9NG and then onto Pittville pump rooms, East Approach Drive, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL52 3JE

[Note: The video begins with Shri Mataji leaving the Sahaja Yoga seminar, and travelling to the source of the Thames (approx 0.15-0.33). Shri Mataji then travels to Cheltenham to visit the Spa.]

This video is not like the usual talk that we see at programmes and pujas, it is a beautiful day in our Mother’s life where she goes on an outing with her children. We will endeavour to share this journey together.....
There were thirteen yogis and yoginis with Shri Mataji which She said represented the 13 crore powers of the Devi.

This video begins with Shri Mataji thanking all the yogis for a lovely weekend as they prepare to leave...as Shri Mataji sits in her car, all her children see her off with music...all the cars began their journey with Mother.
Upon arrival, yogis helped Shri Mataji walk down to the stone area where there are seven sources, small almost puddle areas...like the beginning of a stream.
A yogi takes a little water and places it in Mother’s hand. Shri Mataji stands on a stone where a yogi offers the water to Her Holy Lotus Feet. Everybody is explaining to Shri Mataji how part of the river is called The Isis which flows through Oxford.
Shri Mataji is walking barefoot over this whole area...placing her Divine Lotus Feet in the water....the yogis also join her. All the yogis hail ‘Shri Ganga Mata Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai’
Shri Mataji then asks the yogis ‘are you feeling the cool breeze now?’
The yogis reply in agreement and Mother explains that we have said Jai to her so she is happy...nobody has respected her...
The yogis reply that now she will be respected....
Shri Mataji is saying ‘see now the cool breeze is coming’. Everybody stand with Mother receiving the cool vibrations for a while.
As Shri Mataji and the yogis head back to their cars, Mother walking barefoot, she speaks in hindi to the young ladies with her...’this a very pure place, the birth place of River Thames, so clear and cool.... go and put your feet in the water.
So cool and very soothing....all the left is clearing....Shri Mataji is taking bandhan on her left hand while talking so lightly and joyfully with each other.
As Shri Mataji settles back in her car, the yogis and yoginis are taking a little time at the source bowing and honouring the earth and water. They try to decipher words on the wall which include the words ‘Father Thames’...
Everybody return to their cars and prepare to continue the journey.....the convoy travel through the country roads until they reach the town.
They go into a beautiful building and sit together in a room with a dome ceiling made in the pattern of 36 flowers, which Shri Mataji is admiring. Mother is saying it is very meditative and vibrations are coming. A yogi is telling Mother that this was the hall where they were going to have a meeting but couldn’t. Mother was so happy to hear this, she said that would be great, maybe next time...(machinery sounds as it seems there is work in progress)
Shri Mataji and the yogis are talking about the effects of going to false gurus....She mentions how they mesmerise people. Mother spoke ‘there must be some reason, I asked Raktabeeja, how were you so much subjugated? You should have asked questions. She said no, they say this is to kill your ego’
They continue to talk and Mother explains a saying in Marathi which when translated means that when people go into the temple, they have to take shoes off outside so they will be in the temple but the attention is on the shoes outside!
Shri Mataji and the yogis are enjoying the children and the little ganeshas...
The building administrators were asking a yogi why everybody was sitting there and Mother asked what he replied. The yogi told them that they were waiting to see the water....
While waiting, a yogi offered Mother a little water from a small tap and She confirmed the sulphur quality in the water. Mother continued to explain how sulphur is good for the liver and allergies. Calcium is very good especially for children with allergies. Shri Mataji continues to discuss the left and right...cool and warm effects. Yellow flowers and teas are good for the left ....sulphur is also good for gallstones. This water would not forment.
Shri Mataji also put her attention on Scotland and said that they were enjoying their own destruction and what to do. She said she would create some disaster.
After this, there was an article about the water that was used to make a particular whiskey in Scotland, now contained sulphur so could no longer be used to make that alcohol.
They talked about the River Ganges....the water will always stay pure and clean, whereas other tap water etc will start to spoil after a while....as can be seen when you fill up a bottle.
The Ganges comes from the snow of the Himalaya and passes through many elements. Shri Mataji adds that it comes from the Sahastrara and Shiva.

Shri Mataji and the yogis leave the building and the day ends with talking about havan plans as they see Mother to her car.
Blessed is this land and the river that has been touched by the Holy Feet of Our Divine Mother.
