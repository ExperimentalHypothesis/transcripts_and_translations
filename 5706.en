“The three channels”, public programme, Caxton Hall, London (UK), 23 October 1978.

No doubt, everyone will have to go through this process, but how many really want to be themselves?

There are certain people who say, “We are seeking.” When I ask them, “What are you seeking?” they say, “We are seeking joy, peace, happiness...” Some of them are worried if they are worthy of it or not, whether they should really know their Self or not.

There are two types of problems about such seekers.

One which I call as - “the left-hand side problem” of the Ida Nadi, where the people are very emotional, subdued, who bear all the oppressions of others on themselves. They say, “We are unworthy of this great position, Mother. How can we get Self-realization? We are sinners. How can we be, ... that higher evolved souls, when we have sinned, when we have done wrong?” This is one type.

The another is the one who uses his rationality, and, he thinks, “How can it be possible? How can we get realization?” So many of them cannot believe that there could be a phenomena within us, which works out Self-realization. They do not even understand that God is compassion, He is love. I wonder if such people of this category also really believe in God, in His all-powerful nature. They may have a photograph in their houses.

If He is compassion, if He is love, then He is not going to allow His own creation to be destroyed by foolish human beings, by some foolish people.

So, both ways, one has to understand that every one of you will be exposed to His grace. But if you deny, if you do not want to get exposed, then even the compassion of God recedes; attention of God recedes from such people who do not want to receive the grace of God.

He is anxious, very anxious. You will see that now in Sahaja Yoga, which is a very different phenomena, which you have never before seen, you have never witnessed this before. It is a working of [the] compassionate nature of God. First of all, God – you have only heard about Him in the churches or in the Bible or in the temples, mosques, but you have never seen God at work.

With the advancement of science, it has become really difficult for human beings to even conceive of anyone like that, which we call as God.

There [are] also two types of reactions come; one type which thinks, “Look at the world. How dirty it is, how meaningless it is, how the cruel people are ruling us! The people who are most undeserving, irreligious, who have no scruples are so successful in life!”

The another denial is even stronger, another type, they say that, “How can God be that cruel to create such horrible people on this earth? If He had any understanding of the sufferings of the people, why should He not come down Himself and put an end to all these horrible people, why doesn’t He kill them?”

Is natural for a limited rationality to suggest all these ideas. The rationality does not understand the unlimited compassion of [the] love of God, it does not understand its minute understanding of the problem, and it does not have [a] full idea as to how this compassion works. Neither it understands what is death, what is an agony, what are the miseries of this world in the eyes of God.

The limited understanding of a human being can be seen manifested in every day-to-day life. For example, if a son is arrested by the police, the father gets very upset. Instead of feeling ashamed of such a son who has done something bad, he goes and supports the son, he tries to take him away from the prison, he doesn’t want that, there should be punishment for [his] own son. But the same thing if it is done by somebody else, his attitude is different.

So, man’s attitude towards life is absolutely limited, and when we know about God who is unlimited, His attitude towards life has to be unlimited. He cannot limit His compassion to your needs, individual needs. It is [an] unlimited source which is flowing all the time on this earth. It’s emitting every minute, everywhere, not even a single molecule or an atom is without it. You believe it or not, but it is so. But as soon as it enters into the mind of a human being, it does not want to see its unlimited nature; it sees its limited effects.

For example, what we are trying on this earth with all our human civilization is to get happiness. But do we know: [that] happiness is always combined with unhappiness? The human idea of happiness has always the other side, which is unhappiness. Happiness cannot be without unhappiness.

For example, you think that by developing your country, you will be happy. For us, Indians, we think like that;  that we have to develop our country, we have to build the big things, to make our country’s people happy. But go to the people who are developed, to the most developed, go to Sweden. The number of suicides are maximum in the most developed country. It is a very shocking thing, but it is so.

The more you try to take to happiness, there will be unhappiness. Why is it so? The reason is, [that] one side is, as I say, is the left side, and another is the right side. There is no balance in this pursuit. Balance is only possible if you can control!

For example, children, say, when they grow about eighteen years of age in this country, have a feeling that getting out of their parents’ homes and houses, they would be very happy. So they say, “Oh, on our own we are now, we are going out to, on ourselves, we’ll have a house of our own, we’ll live on our own, we’ll have everything on our own...” Are they happy people? If they are, then why do they take to drugs?

Or else you can think of somebody who comes from a poorer family, he thinks that if he could get lots of money, he’ll be a very happy man. So he, for example, he might do some sort of a puzzle or may go to,  all kinds of races or whatever you have here – competitions to get more money, sort of thing – and may win a prize for it. Supposing even if he gets any amount of money – I have known some people who have won the prizes, and they are the unhappiest people ever known. Because from one side the money comes in, [and] from the other side the unhappiness comes up,  as if they walk hand-in-hand.

We must keep our eyes open to this fact: that why in all the affluent countries, there is such a lot of unhappiness, why people are committing suicide?

But do not go to the other extreme also, where you just don’t do anything, sit at home, do nothing, lethargy about it. As you have seen the left-hand side, which is the existence power within us, we exist whether we are lazy or not, whether we work hard or not we exist.

Here, there are many young people who first came to Me, they said, “Mother, we are successfully unemployed.” They think by doing no work they will achieve their goal, and they will achieve God; this is another falsehood.

[A] One-sided attitude makes it limited. Those who run after money and position, those who run after women and run after all other worldly things and possessions of the world, are equally unhappy as the people who are killed in the wars. Or maybe even more unhappy, because they’re at least killed and finished. But here everybody is living in a state of agony.

So the human attitude towards things is that if you think there is a war and some people are killed, we think that these people are unhappy. But why in some of the countries people go and kill themselves then? If death was unhappiness, why [did] they run away from unhappiness to another bigger unhappiness? If you kill yourself, then do you think it is going to be happiness? And if somebody else kills you, then it is unhappiness?

I’m already saying all these things, before also, and today that this is what is called as “falsehood,” is mithyavaad, [speak falsely/lie – ED]. Both things are false. It is for you to see the falsehood of one thing and [the] falsehood of another.

Say for example Mr. Ian Smith, the great hero he thinks himself to be, in his aggression is trying to kill people. Is he a happy man who has achieved it? Or are they happy, those whom he has killed?

God has no play in this kind of foolishness. God never asked these aggressors, like Hitler to start a war, he did it in his own freedom.

Then what must we do to create people who would not get into unhappiness and a mirage of happiness? What is, where are we going to control the balance between the two?

The one side which is the left side, we can see the developing countries are using it. They are poorer people, I went to Colombia and I went to Chile and to Argentina, and to many other developing countries, to China. I was amazed that their families’ systems are still intact, their societies are still intact, their families are doing very well. They have no problem about their families – even in India, we do not have.

The developed are on the right-hand side, are the people who are developed. So many think that they are happy people. They have accumulated money, they have earned a reputation that they are developed, but their families are broken, they are so insecure, maximum number of, say, breast cancers are in here. The insecurities are built-in.

It is more surprising how nature works its balance in a human being. When you are very much insecure on the left-hand side, which is the result, you’ll be amazed. The insecurity of the left-hand side comes when your right side is over-developed. When you are over-developed, the families are destroyed, the houses are destroyed, the children are destroyed, you are alone, [an] individual, on your own, hanging in the air.

Then there are problems of the left-hand side, in the sense you feel very insecure  in your emotions, you cannot trust anybody, you don’t know, you will go home and “What is going to happen?” The husband today goes to another woman and the woman goes to another man, and all sorts of things are going on.

These are the problems of the left-hand style, start with the people who develop their right-hand side because they neglect their left-hand side.

On the contrary, [those] who develop their right-hand side, try to develop – like the developing countries.

I’m sorry, those who develop their left side, their society and family. Here we hear that people kill their children, but in India, there could be many people who are making bad money for their own children. They are not afraid of [the] law if they have to look after their children, they could be dacoits (a member of a band of armed robbers in India) for their own children. They won’t live for themselves, but they live for their children, and they think they are doing right because they are doing it for their children.

So those who are working out the left-hand side are having the problems of the right hand.

And the right-hand problem is that they are all the time insecure about money,  insecure about their positions; they’ll cut each other’s throats to get to a position. They are hankering after – supposing there is a, - say, a secretary and a higher position – I don’t know their names, you see it’s all prepositions to Me – but somebody who is a higher secretary and somebody’s a lower secretary. The lower secretary will cut the throat of the higher secretary to get to that. All his life he’ll be wasting in that. Like Mr. Ian Smith.

Their aggression is in the power, so the people deny that power. They say, “No, we do not care for power.” Then they move to the right-hand side, that is Rajoguna. They say, “All right, we do not want any power, we do not want anything, we’ll be very simple people.” But they cannot be that way either.

Hippies who did that, they painted themselves. They said, “We have nothing to do with this cloth and all that, and this uniform that one has to wear, we do not care, let us become hippies.” They thought in their minds they were becoming primitive, but they were not. So, they take to [the] left-hand side deeper life, that is to take to drugs, is the deeper left-hand side thing. Going to the dead in a deeper way.

So, you are left from one to another – from that when you develop, you come back to another. It’s like a pendulum, as I have told you before, many a times. But nature controls it,  by itself, also.

Those people who are working on the left-hand side, means who are very busy with their children and are looking after their families, but are not worried about their wives and about their mothers and fathers, but who are worried about their positions and power and money, left side people, they will get mostly heart attacks.  If they try to work very hard, as they say,    - I mean, they are actually working on the right-hand side. If you see their nature is.  Left-hand people would work on the right-hand side. You see the difference, that those who are the people who have not yet developed, who try to develop themselves.

So, this is a juncture at which, what we find, [is] the people who are not developed, are developing themselves and those who are developed are trying to become underdeveloped, primitive.

At this juncture we are, at this position when I’m speaking to you, today.

So, there is a possibility that when the movement starts, suddenly from this right to the left by the developed people, people will become mad. They’ll be crazy, their head will fail. This is the control of the nature.

When you try to work very hard, go to your office morning, evening, you are worried about your position, and you think you must achieve this position, and go ahead like a horse in the race, then you get a heart attack.

Imagine!  What a balance! You should not get a heart attack for this.  Why should you get a heart attack, [when] it is on the left-hand side?!

But those people who neglect their left-hand side, means they have no families, they have no children, they are over-developed, they are not worried about money, they get their doles all right;  go nutty here, quite nutty. Such stupid people that when you look at them, you are amazed at their stupidity. They do all kinds of stupid things, which they do not understand,   this ego has made them such a fool. It can start from anywhere to anywhere. For example, now we are in England, so we have to discuss about our problems in the West. It may be that people would put those nails into their bodies, they might paint their bodies. Might be an eighty-year-old man trying to marry a sixteen-year-old girl. All their lives they would not know what to do, when, wisdom would be missing. They are so stupid that when you read [about] it, you are amazed!

But they go on doing it, you know, the stupidity they do not see.  Ego has that capacity to cover you so well that you do not see your stupidity. Such idiotic things people do, that one cannot understand that such well-educated, highly qualified people, could be that stupid, like your Lord Byron. I mean, he was a real stupid fellow, no doubt about him. Though he might have written some great poems - or whatever he might have done – with his brain, but if you see his lifestyle, he was a stupid fool!

We do not realize it, but now when you come to Sahaja Yoga, one has to tell you that this is stupidity. That, going to the extremes of the right side, is as stupid as going to the left side.

Those who are self-centred people, [are] only worried about their own children, about on their own families, about their own circle.

In India, we have also caste system, this system. These people are also on one extreme, I would say, as you people are on the other extreme. You do not have all this, but you have other things. But the result of all this is: [that] those who try to run after positions, run after money, run after material possessions, are never happy people, can never be happy. You accumulate any amount of them, you will find they are the unhappiest people ever living. Because I have told you that happiness and unhappiness go hand in hand.

On the other side, when you love your children, is all right. But if you love them more than the collective being, like you see, say in our country or any country, where people would do anything for their children, they will sacrifice the whole country for their children. Under such circumstances also, a person cannot be happy.

So, what is the balancing factor between the two, that we have to see? What is the source of happiness that comes to a person? There has to be some balance about it. And this balance is the balance you learn in your dharma, in your religion, in your sustenance, that is in your stomach. That’s why sustenance is a very important part which gives us the balance of our being really happy, if it is done in dharma, with control!

Say for example we’ll take the right-hand side people – those who are trying to,  I mean those who are working on [the] right-hand side, trying to learn a lot, and trying to achieve a position – are of the Maha-Saraswati channel as we call it. If you see the Maha-Saraswati’s, Saraswati’s symbol that was created by those old, ancient sages, you’ll be amazed, [at] how they knew that we would lose our balance. The way they created Her image is most interesting.

Those who run after money are worshipping actually Lakshmi. Lakshmi also has an image which is so wonderfully balanced, that you cannot imagine how it is suggested that: if a person has to have Lakshmi, what are the things needed? Lakshmi is the goddess they say of wealth and well-being. But it is the daughter of Maha Lakshmi you can say, or in the small form of Maha Lakshmi, which is the goddess of sustenance, which is the goddess of your evolution. That is the power by which you evolve.

This goddess has got four hands. She’s first of all a mother. That means a person who is a rich man must be a person full of compassion. Where do you find such people? The man who has lots of money, must get with money, side-by-side, [a] lot of compassion. And such a man will never suffer if he has money, but if he has no compassion in his heart, then that money is going to eat him off. His children will run away, he will do some sort of wrong things, and he will suffer on account of that money.

Then, if you see Lakshmi’s hand, with one hand She gives. The rich man, so-called  “rich man,” must have [a] rich heart. If he’s a miserly fellow, if he’s a miser, if you go to his house and he cannot give, then he is not a rich man.

For example, what I find in the advertisements you read anywhere, these people always when they try to advertise, they will say: “Save three pies to buy this.” This is the advertisement. I mean, the whole accent is on saving and miserliness throughout, not on quality too. Miserliness is a sign of horrible poverty of the heart; even a poor man who is generous is [a] thousand times richer than a miserly rich person. He stings of miserliness.

She gives. She doesn’t take, but She gives. If riches are accumulated by taking somebody’s money illegally or troubling somebody, and in a grabbing way, all the time thinking of collecting more money and more money and more money, I can assure you it will never lead you to happiness.

But if you are getting money just to give, just an agency, just to give, you are there to get it and to be given, not only to your children and only to the people who are dependent around you or those who try to be your friends, who come for drinks and eat your food, but in a very unknown manner that you do not know how you spend your money where, and you do not talk about it, you do not tell about it, you do not say about it – that is a real rich man and such a man never suffers from the dearth of money.

This symbol was given to us through the unconscious itself has prepared this symbol for us to understand that riches are not with the people who accumulate money. You will find a common example: those people who accumulate money with miserliness, people talk so ill about them, they make fun of such miserly people, they just laugh at such a person, they just can’t understand that is another stupidity to be a miser.

The another hand is like this. This hand suggests the protection, the protection given to anybody who needs help, anybody, again I am saying – that is the real rich man.

These are ideals, of course, everybody is not perfect, but these are ideals.

Anybody who comes to your house and asks for help, give him help. “It’s very difficult,” people will say, “It is very difficult to help anyone who asks for anything, ‘All right, you take it away.’” How can you say that? But you’ll be so rich, so rich, that you would not know what to do with your things and how to get rid of them.

Anybody who comes in your way, you say, “All right, you want this, all right, take it.” Try some time My formula, [is] worth trying. I’ve lived like this all My life.

I’ll give you an example, you see in India women prefer nylon saris very much, and I don’t like them very much Myself, I’m a different type, I would say. And I had one good nylon sari with Me, and a friend of Mine said: “Oh, I haven’t got one good nylon from the foreign country.”

So, I told My niece-in-law, I said, “I think I should give her this sari. She’s My elder, but we can give it on a Dussehra day to an elder something, so I’ll give her this sari because she said it.” She said, “You have only one and that You want to give away?” I said: “That’s all. She has said it, that’s sufficient, I’m going to give her this.”

When we were talking about this in the kitchen, you will be amazed, somebody rang the bell. And one gentleman had come from Africa, and he said: “I have got something for You from East Africa.” I said: “What?” He got two nylon saris, one of them was of the same colour as I had. And he said, “The lady who had gone here, and  she needed some money, so You gave her in Bombay, so she has purchased these and sent them.”     I said: “See, the proof has come.” The same colour, exactly the same sari was there. I said, “See, two. Now are we going to wear two of them or what?”

You just try, if you believe that there is compassion, there is God in every, every movement of every small little molecule. If you really believe in it, then try this.

Of course, I mean, there’s nothing that you, if you do not get, one should not worry, because if you are really lordly and if you are really kingly as we call it baadshah [“king” in Hindi].

See Guru Nanak was called as baadshah, not that He was the emperor of India, baadshah is a thing that is the temperament as they say, the tabeeat [“nature” in Hindi], is the temperament of a king.

Even if you could put a king - if he’s really rich, why should he worry about the great comforts? No comfort can dominate a kingly person; he will sleep on a stone like a king, he’ll walk on the rugged road like a king, [and] you can see his majesty and his dignity in his grace whether in adversity or in where the people are praising. He’s above all those things. That is the sign of a kingly personality.

In Sahaja Yoga, when you come in, as I have told you Sahaja Yoga [is] not like this that you take a toothpaste, all right, you rub it and you’ll get the results. No. You have to also do the Antar Yoga.

Once your Kundalini has tried there, you have to do the Antar Yoga, [which] means you have to raise your Kundalini again and again and raise your sense of beauty, your aesthetics, not in buying the antiques, but by enjoying the joy of aesthetics of life.

So, miserliness is unaesthetic hundred per cent!  Anybody who talks about miserliness should be absolutely an ugly person whatever he may be wearing, whatever may be his money.

So, with one hand She gives, with one hand She gives protection to people, protection to people: ashirvaad. Abhaya, this is the abhaya [fearlessness – ED]. Those who come for the help of such a person, he gives protection.

The two other hands have got beautiful lotus flowers in the hand. They are pink in colour  and, you know, the pink colour suggests the love, the love, the warmth. Such a person should be a warm person, not to the people of your equal ranks and high rank, but to anyone who comes.

When somebody comes to your house, and if your face shows discomfort, then you are not a Lakshmipati you are not blessed by Lakshmi.

Must have that grace and that beauty. “Oh! God, somebody has come at this time, what must be the difficulty, why has he come in the night?” You should feel that within yourself, “Oh, I hope everything’s all right. What should I do for him?”

The warmth of the heart, the cosiness of the lotus, the black bee, which is a very big black thing, is one of the ugliest and very hard, - tough things, and the legs are covered with thorny prickly ends, but the lotus opens its leaves and the lotus is extremely soft inside; it takes in this lonely, black bee and, it rests there, in that comfort.

The comfort that one indulges into for oneself, if it is not shared with others! That doesn’t mean that you call people for drinks and share the drinks, I mean the sin.

Sin is very easily shared by people; it’s a common practice to share the sin. It’s very much  enjoyable, you see, such a person is regarded as ‘extremely jolly and a nice person’, who comes and says, talks about very filthy things.

But comfort-giving, love-giving things are never shared with others.

Try to share and see [if] what I say is correct or not. You will feel so elevated within yourself, [that] you start enjoying that comfort that the other person is enjoying. [It] is the most enjoyable time when you see others are enjoying comfort because you have done something. And that is the greatest fulfilling thing for Me, to see that others have had it. This, in short, is the image of Lakshmi.

The image of Saraswati is to be understood, also very well, is the image of the goddess of learning. Of course, I’ve known many learned pundits in India and also abroad.

Lakshmi is a married lady, but Saraswati is not. Learned people who are really of a very high quality, are [a] little away, are [a] little above, because they have to solve the problems for the society. They are not mundane type, they have to sacrifice a little of their married life and their personal life, because they are the people who have to give the vision to the society.

And She has in her hand a veena, and in one hand She has a rosary, in the another hand She has the knowledge, that is books.

Of course, She must read, no doubt. Means that those who are learned must be knowledgeable people. And I have seen so many of you have been to gurus, and I was surprised [of] the rumble-tumble knowledge you have about Kundalini. When they told Me that: “These are the bija mantras and these ...” I was shocked! How...

(SIDE 1 ENDS ABRUPTLY.)

...and you are shocked [by] the way his knowledge is, he’s just a show-off. .

You get somebody, say a great historian, supposed to be a great historian, and you find that his knowledge about history is so factual there is no depth, there’s no vision in him to see why these things happened, why in history these things changed and what have we to learn from history. No vision of any kind.

The books are in the hand, [which] means the books are not sitting on you, but they are in your hand, you have mastered the books. Mastering of the book doesn’t mean that you should know them by heart and go and tell people about what knowledge is there in Gita, and what knowledge is there,  in the Bible, or any other book. No, that’s not the way the knowledge is. The knowledge is, when you tell, that application of it in your own life and in other’s lives, when you show the practicability of that knowledge, when that knowledge is a light in your life, it is like a light for others, then he is a learned man.

I met a very great philosopher of India; he has written many books on philosophy. And I found him to be such a superficial person, such a shallow person, I was amazed. I said, “How can this man talk of philosophy? In his life there is no light of philosophy, there is no light of compassion, there is no life of understanding of any kind. What has he writing about? It’s a lifeless writing.”

The another hand has got the rosary. Now rosary has the significance of the religious life.

A learned man has to be a religious man, a man who is bowed down to the knowledge of God, the one who is seeking the knowledge of God.

The man who seeks, say, the knowledge of economics only, what’s the use? You know that wants are not satiable in general. So what’s the use of running after such a knowledge?

But if you are religious and if you have studied also the knowledge of religion, then you can relate that knowledge to religion. If you have no idea of religion, then you cannot relate this knowledge to that. Such a knowledge is absolutely useless.

If you study physics and if you have not known, what is science of inside, you cannot understand Kundalini Shastra at all. If it cannot be related to the ultimate, it is a lost knowledge. Like the tributaries of the river, all the tributaries must fall into the big river Ganges to go into the sea. That is the end of all the knowledge, and the knowledge that does not connect it with the superior knowledge is a waste. That’s why you will find so many big people came, they wrote books after books, they are, all just become nothing, but zero.

Only those who related their knowledge to something higher – even Einstein, a man of his calibre, he could not do without God’s ideas; Bernard Shaw could not do without God’s idea – all of them had to relate their knowledge to God’s knowledge. Otherwise, it is like a knowledge which has no roots. It’s a dead knowledge. That is why the rosary in the hand of a learned is given.

And in the hand is the veena. Veena is the instrument which is the first instrument that was created – that is the primordial knowledge about aesthetics of sound, the primordial ideas about aesthetics of colours,  the science of beauty. He has to be a man who understands beauty, in its glory and not in its condemnation.

Such learned people are to be respected. And these are our ideals as far as the movement of your being is concerned. You have to move with the idea that whatever extreme you are trying to do, avoid it, be in the centre and keep your eyes on the ideals that we have to have these other sides also otherwise only the nose will increase, or the ears will increase, or the eyes will increase. The whole has to be increased by balance, then only you can have the real joy out of it, and not the combination happiness must go with unhappiness.

But the greatest thing of getting the joy is Self-knowledge, is to know your Self. Once you have known your Self, it’s like a light which gives you a complete balance. Once you have known your Self, you will know the collective being, and then you will know also that all this knowledge, whatever you have got so far, is for the use of the collective being within yourself [your Self].

Then you will be rightly using that knowledge for the right purpose, the wealth that you have cumulated for the right purpose. And then the real joy will come into you. And it has to be understood in its complete form and not in its part here and a part there. Those who lead such partial life, are imbalanced and can never be happy. As long as they are running, they may be, but when they stop, they’ll be very unhappy.

So never confuse happiness with joy; joy is something very different from happiness. Do not seek happiness, but seek joy and blessings of God by which our lives are blossomed, that we receive all the dimensions as I told you that you all have sixty-four dimensions which are to be exposed, sixty-four dimensions all of you have got.  But they are not possible to be even felt before Self-realization, so Self-realization is the first step, which one should achieve.

Now those who think that, “After all we have to live in this world,” everybody lives. Do not divert your attention to something that is not so important. Now the time has come for you to put your attention to the right thing, so you achieve the right results at your life. As it is, you will find that you have already wasted your time, in the way, when you will think over it, you will think, “Oh God, I have been doing this, all this my life.” But now the time has come for us to respect ourselves, evaluate ourselves and make the best and the maximum out of it.

Today I have given this lecture, because after eight days or so, on the same day, today, Monday, there is a Diwali in India, where we have really a combination of four things and one of them is this Lakshmi Puja. On the Diwali day, when next time I speak, I’ll tell you all these four days what do they show.

But those who think by denying God, by not paying attention to Him, they could be happy, and they could be joyful, they are sadly mistaken. Ultimately it is He who is to be achieved, it is He who is to be manifested, it is He who is to be worshipped and to be enjoyed. So those who think that anything else is going to replace this are sadly mistaken.

You will see, those, thousands of years back those who came in the name of God were not the people very successful or very rich or something like that, a very great seducer or people like Duke of Wellington. But they were great people, they are the milestones of our creation and not these, who just arbitrarily behave without understanding the universal nature that is within us.

May God bless you all!

Let us have some meditation and see how it works out for all of you.

If you have any questions, anyone of you please ask, any questions are there, we will do [it] for five minutes, not much time is to be wasted on questioning.

You have to take out your shoes.

(The following is a translation into English of a small section of the talk where Mother spoke in Hindi.)

How are you? Body shakes in front of Me. Your Guruji Maharaj, God save you from him! Each one is...

Keep your eyes open. Are you feeling the cool breeze, little?

How are you all? Okay.

(Talk continued in English.)

Shri Mataji: Who are the new people today, absolutely new? Now... Who else is?

Man: This lady’s for the first time.

Shri Mataji: You are also for the first time? You had come earlier.

Lady: Yes, from Birmingham. Bala asked You.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. May God bless you. She’s already got  Realization. Bala is a great Sahaja Yogi he is, must say. He started his work in Birmingham, and he has given  Realization to so many people. And he just can’t understand how, by raising Kundalini, how he’s being able to give  Realization to people, how it is working! Every one of you can do it, those who are  Realized. But some people have courage like Bala, who has just taken up upon himself, and even these two gentlemen’s friends Subramanyam. He came to see Me in Bombay, [no] in Delhi, just to – he was driving a car to drop some people, and he came to see Me, got his  Realization. As today, he’s a very great Sahaja Yogi, in Delhi, he has cured so many people, and he is doing such a lot of work.

So, it is only for the Sahaja Yogis to take upon themselves. See those who take up, they can work it out very well, it’s not difficult. All of you are enlightened, and you all can do great work.

That’s what I was wondering, that I have not seen her before, and how she is realized!

Lady with[a]  German accent: I’ve searched for the truth for so long. I know the truth is in you, I know that without any, – I read this paper (unclear), and I knew immediately. And in thirty-three years I have searched for someone who really speaks the truth and doesn’t bend the truth, and you don’t find those,

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s why you find it, also. If you accept something as truth, and you linger on it, then it is a wrong thing, you see? And then what happens, that you are identified with it, and it’s very difficult because these misidentifications cannot drop out. You have to give up this misidentification, then only the truth comes within you.

And [the] truth is the most joy-giving thing, I mean it is joy, truth is joy and that’s beauty, sat-chit-ananda.

It is not a harsh thing. Truth is not harsh. People think truth means harsh stuff, no it is not, it’s the most beautiful thing. It’s the most delicate thing, it’s a very subtle thing, and it’s the most joy-giving thing. It’s the truth that when it ripples, you see when it pulsates, then you get the joy. The pulsation of truth is joy. It’s not harsh, it’s extremely kind, compassionate. Love of God is truth. They say, “God is love, and love is God,” but people don’t understand what does that mean!

Do you have any questions? Is there any question?

You have come for the first time?

Man. Yes. 

Shri Mataji: You, you can come forward here. I would like to see you. Who else is there? Come along, come along. What’s the matter? Hmm? There’s one space here. Please be seated. Sit there.

(Mother asks a question in Hindi.)

Now put your hands like this, just like this. With comfort. Don’t strain yourself, just put it like this, just like that. [There] is nothing to be done much. Truth is silent, it doesn’t speak, it just works. Start getting cool breeze in your hand and go into meditation with that. Breeze-like thing.

Those who cannot close their eyes properly must keep their eyes open. If you can close them nicely without any difficulty, without any flickering, then it’s all right, that means you are all right. But in case there is any flickering in the eyes, then keep them open. They shake, sometimes, quite a lot, before Me.

Are you feeling the coolness in your hands? Are you feeling the coolness? Open your palm, open your eyes. Don’t close your eyes. ...[Inaudible].

Sit with your hands open. You must feel the coolness in your hands.

...there’s a cool breeze-like thing [that] should come in the hand. If it is not coming, you don’t worry, it will work out. It’s coming? That’s good, that’s good.

(In Hindi: Yes, it is coming. It will start coming slowly.)

(Mother asks someone in Hindi.)

What about you? You have some problem; it will become all right. It will come.

How are you now? Okay. Are you feeling the coolness in your hands? No, not yet. You come in the front, someone will see. Doctor, you sit here.

(In English.)

Just sit down. We’ll see.

Keep your right hand on your heart. His back with... Heart, on the... right hand on the heart, yes. Put your hand on his back, just rub it a bit.

(In Hindi.)

Do you have a guru?

Audience: No. I don’t have any.

Mother: Look here. Are you a devotee of Devi? No. Do you worship Durgaji? Do you worship Durgaji? Who do you worship? Vishnu. Vishnu is also like the Sun God. Whether you worship or not ... (Inaudible)

Come sit here.

How are you, Sardarji? Ok. That’s it, you have become fine. What have you got to do? Yes, now your mother has also started looking nice. Come here and sit. Come and sit. Come sit in the front, move your hand, straighten both your legs. (Inaudible. Conversation.)

That he has a problem, the whole right there. Hmm. Just like this. You put a little pressure there. Hmm.

Now it’s done, can you feel it? (Conversation in Marathi.)

The heat has to go out, too much heat he has...[Inaudible. ]

Don’t keep your eyes closed. So, how are you feeling?

So, how’s the lady?

(NOTE: The transcriber was not able to understand and complete about 7-10 minutes of the talk in Hindi towards the end of the talk.)

Shri Mataji in English: Very hot, ...  [unclear]. (?It is asthma) Just imagine, he’s feeling cold, and he’s feeling hot. See it before you’ll lose.  Both of them of the same thing they have come together, but he had a problem, you see? (Unclear words, being) near, he’s putting   his body into you. Now that’s the reason, and I told you that’s a wrong thing, eh?

And he’s just looking, and he said, “Is he?” It’s a kind of a disease you get.

Better now?

Man: I was feeling from You going down.

Shri Mataji: Yes, the heat has to go out, you see. Too much heat you have within you. That is what it is.

Rub his back. Want some water?

How is he?

Lady: He’s very good.

Shri Mataji: He said “Yes” to Me last week, last week, ha? Last week. Problem is...

Let her sit there. Just put her left hand like this.

Just tell him to move like that.

Don’t keep your eyes closed. All right? Keep them open and then pay attention on My feet, you can (indistinct) for a while.

So how is the lady? Oh! Oh, she is very normal now. Isn’t she? How are you? You are finally normal now, much better, much relaxed. (Indistinct.)

What about you, how are you now, are you better? Better? You don’t need that feeling now. (Indistinct.)

So how is it, but how are your parents? Did you go and see them?

Lady: Not yet. (Indistinct.)

Shri Mataji: You can’t really work on her?

How are you? You’re all right.
