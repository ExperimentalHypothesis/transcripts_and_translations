Evening Program after Christmas Puja, Pune, India, 25-12-1986

From there Angapuri you remember we have been near Brahmapuri and from there even you can walk down if you want to Brahmapuri.

Your cars can go that side they can walk down. So Angapuri if you remember next to Brahmapuri you can walk back from there if you like and your buses can go ahead to Brahmapuri. So you get down at Angapur and let the buses go ahead only take out your torches and in any case you must keep one dress handy for yourself. So then it is easy because every time I don't want you to get down with the luggage and again get ticked off you see. Now this time is going to be for three days in Brahmapuri this day so it would be much better. So they are saying after lunch if you leave you will be quite in time for the procession. I hope you like this place very much and also I think I brought down the temperature all right for you. It was quite quite cold but now it's all right no wind is blowing. You see human mind is such I have seen that it always creates an objection, burocratic. Like you tell them one thing, they said "no, that is not possible" Then you tell them another, "that is not possible", this solution "that is not possible".

One telling them they said "no, but is not possible, nothing is possible under the sun". So my job is to give solution and your is to say "no" But is a thing that goes again the flow, say the river is flowing and the stone has a job to stop the river. It can never stop of course. But creates a funny ripple. So better learn to flow with the whole thing it will work out it works out and because of this mental attitude you see never find solutions if our mental attitude is such we'll never find solutions if our mental attitude is such no we have to find a solution we are going to give mother some solution. Then the whole thing changes but this is not possible that is not possible this cannot be done that cannot be done so all the gods also give up this all right don't do anything but it is an escapisism is a kind of an escape.
