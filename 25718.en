I bow to all the seekers of truth.  As I told you yesterday that truth is what it is and we cannot organise it, we cannot conceptualise it and we cannot know it at this human awareness.  We have to go into a subtler state to know it.

So what is the truth?  The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.  And the second truth is that there is an all-pervading power of God’s love which does all living work.  To discover this you have to become the Spirit.  Now as I told you yesterday that it happens through your evolutionary process that you have come from the amoeba stage to this stage and now there’s a little more breakthrough.  The actualisation of becoming the self is the actualisation of the baptism as described in Christianity.  Actualisation, again it’s not something somebody puts a hand on your head and you’re baptised.  It’s happening, it’s a reality and thus when it happens and when you become the Spirit, then you discover that you have divinity within you.  Your divinity starts manifesting itself.

So the ideas of the Divine, the talking of Divine which looks quite mysterious to us becomes a reality within us.  The self is to be understood as been described in so many scriptures but as I said yesterday whatever I am telling you should not be accepted blindfolded but you must keep a scientific outlook, keep an open mind and if it works you have to accept it as honest people.  Also, it is the evolutionary process, the living process of the living power you cannot pay for it.  It is spontaneous that is Sahaja, is born with you.

When you get your Self Realization, as so many of you got yesterday, it started.  You felt a kind of a cool breeze on your fingertips, you felt a cool breeze coming out of your head.  You have to certify yourself, nobody is going to certify you, it’s your own achievement.  Now what is this cool breeze is described as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost in the Bible or we can say is the all-pervading power of God’s love as described in all scriptures.

Adi Shankaracharya said (…..saleelum saleelum … unsure of spelling), cool cool. Is called as a ……(unclear), meaning beautiful waves, waves of beauty.  But these waves of beauty you start feeling because you got connected to this divine Power.  For the first time, you have felt it, before that it was just a story to you that there is an all-pervading power.  But for the first time, you felt this cool breeze and the joy of your Spirit.  But when this cool breeze starts coming and you start feeling them you must know that there are five, six and seven centres within us on the right-hand side and also on the left-hand side.  These centres are shown here as seven, one two three four five six seven.

These are subtle centres and when this power which I said yesterday as Kundalini which connects you to that power is awakened she rises through six centres she pierces, and the seventh centre is just guarding this power.  So the sixth centre it penetrates through.  Now the centres are something like this, the left and the right.  When you start using the energy these are the centres they nourish us and give us our energy for physical, mental, emotional being.

So when you start using say on the right side when you think too much, you are futuristic, then you start using it on the right side, or you start moving it to the left side, the energy between the two is constricted, gets exhausted and that’s how you get sick.  You get sick physically, mentally, emotionally and also there are diseases which are the combinations of these two sides which we call as psychosomatic which are incurable.

But when the Kundalini rises she nourishes them and puts them back in the proper places.  Sometimes these get broken up and when they’re broken up there is no connection also with the mains, in the sense, it has no connection with your brain and they start working on their own so malignancy also sets in.  But when she pierces through this fontanel bone area which was the soft bone on your fontanel bone area here, just on the top of your head, first some people do feel a little throbbing but then it’s breakthrough and you feel the cool breeze or sometimes a hot breeze also comes here.  Now the seat of the Spirit is here but the reflection of the Spirit is in the heart so when it pierces through, the Spirit is brought into your attention and the light of the Spirit when it comes into your attention, it starts working on your central nervous system.  And that’s how you feel the cool breeze on your hands.

Now when we say that you are a self-realized person, then you have to feel this power on your central nervous system, it’s not just a mental projection, is beyond a mental projection.  By mental projection, even a murderer can say oh I’m alright, God has done this for me.  But when you cross that point and enter into the new consciousness then you know the absolute truth.  Absolute truth is that everybody feels the same way because Spirit is absolute.  For example, there’s a child who’s a realized soul.  You take ten children who are realized souls and put somebody before them and ask what’s wrong with this person.  They will all raise the same finger, say this one.  So you ask the person have you got throat trouble. Yes, but how do you know?  Because this fingertip is decoded to be related to this centre here which we call as Vishuddhi Chakra.  That’s how you can find out absolute truth about anyone.

Yesterday I told you when they asked the question about the false gurus that how will you make out the false from the real?  Even how will you recognise Christ?  They never recognised him when he came so how will you recognise him?  The only way is that if you are a self-realized person immediately you can feel it on your fingertips.  If it is Christ you just ask is it Christ?  You become like a divine computer.  You start feeling a tremendous cool breeze.  Any question, is there God?  People just declare there’s no God.  I mean it is very unscientific.  Have you found out is there God or not?  How can you just declare there is no God without finding out.  That’s blindness.  So you have to find out is there God.  So ask this question if you are a realised soul immediately you start getting a cool breeze.  But supposing there’s a cheat who says that I am a saint.  You can find it out, when you start feeling a little burning maybe, sometimes might get a little blistering for a while but disappears.  You become like a barometer.

Thus you discover the absolute truth about yourself and about others and you don’t mind facing yourself at all because this is what is self-knowledge.  Many people would come to me and say, Mother, my Agnya is horrible, this centre That means this person has got an ego. Nobody will say Mother I have got an ego, nobody would say that.  But they will say I have got this Agnya so he is confessing that I have got too much ego better remove it because this screw is little loose sometimes if you turn it, it works out.

It’s very simple, the whole mechanism is made.  Say for example we have a television, through ether, we can see so many films and so many musics, everything you can see in modern times.  But if you go to a remote village say in India or someplace where they have not known anything about television, you show them the television, and that you can say that you can see all kinds of films from all over the world.  They’ll say what you are telling some stories to us, this is just a box.

In the same way, we also feel about ourselves that we are just a box, but once put to the mains you discover what you are, how glorious you are, how divine you are, how beautiful you are.  So this thing has to happen within us so we become the Self.  As a result, we become knowledgeable about the absolute.  Once everybody knows the same truth how can there be any quarrel?  Nobody can fight there because everybody knows the same thing about anything.  They will have the same answer.  There cannot be wars, there cannot be any conflict, nothing of the kind.  Everything then you understand as completely integrated, everything becomes one, you understand that all religions are one.

We are the ones who have, as I told yesterday, taken of the flowers from the living tree of divinity and are fighting with the dead flowers.  Then you are amazed at how they are interwoven.  Christ has said those who are not against me are with me.  Even Mohammed Sahib has said never a word has to be said against Mary, she’s pure.  How is it they knew each other so well and they talked about each other, how they are connected to each other, all this you know through your Self Realization.

For example, there was a Sikh gentleman who came to see me, at that time the Sikhs and the Muslims were at daggers end and he had a stomach problem of a very serious nature.  So I said that you have faith in Guru Nanak.  
Yes of course I have.
What about Mohammed Sahib?
No, I have no faith in him.
I said then I can’t cure you.

You can ask a question Mother is Guru Nanak the same as Mohammed Sahib?
He said I can’t ask this question.  I said all right, I can’t help you.  Went home but his wife was very much worried because they came all the way to London to see me so she brought him around.  And she said no harm in asking the question.  I said better ask.  As soon as he asked the question three times he started feeling a little cool breeze.  Now I said you say that Guru Nanak and Mohammed Sahib were the same.  As soon as he said started getting a lot of cool breeze and he got cured out of that.

So the truth that we do not know gets confirmed.  Whatever is written in most of the scriptures is the truth and then you can verify it.  For example, Christ was the son of God.  I mean so many people are saying all kinds of nonsensical things about him.  They have no sense of (…… unclear).  Surprising I mean because God has given them tongue and God has given them some brains they are absolutely brainless people.  To ask a question “Was Christ the son of God?  Just the question and you get the answer.  So you know the absolute truth once you are a self-realized person.

Secondly, when the Kundalini rises she goes to this green part as you see.  We call it as the Void or is called as the Bhavasagara, the ocean of illusion and all the Ten Commandments are there, means we human beings have got ten valencies.  Carbon has four as you know and we have ten valencies.  In the matter, there are eight valencies maximum and in the animals, there are nine but in human beings there are ten.  So all these get enlightened and you become a really a righteous person, become a saint.  You don’t do anything wrong you just don’t do it, don’t have any temptations, you don’t have any greed, you don’t have any lust, you lead a very sane married life.  Automatically it happens, I don’t have to tell you.  And that’s how you give up all those habits which have enslaved you and have sometimes ruined also.  Overnight you see people becoming all right.

But when you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit you really give up most of the nonsensical things which are destructive and you take to the right thinking and not what you think in a righteous way but you act because there’s a complete integration of your personality.  Whatever you think with your brain your heart supports fully and your liver works it out.  It’s such an interesting personality you develop that you are amazed at yourself.  As I told you your health improves and you know the truth but also you get a new awareness called collective consciousness as described by Jung and this collective consciousness gives you the bodha as they call it.  Bodha means the sensation on your fingertips, on your central nervous system to know what’s wrong with others also, what’s wrong with their centres.  Then you don’t talk that he’s very egotistical, you do not say that he’s very conditioned, what you talk, let’s see he’s catching on this centre, he's catching on that centre, catching on that centre.  This is the language you start speaking, you just talk the language of your centres and the centres of another which is detached from you and once you know how to correct it in that collective consciousness you can help thousands of people.

Nowadays I don’t cure people but Sahaja yogis are curing all over the world.  As I told you in Russia there are four hundred doctors who are practising Sahaja Yoga.  Another thing that happens to you as you become the Spirit, that your attention, your attention becomes steady and enlightened so wherever you put attention it works.  Sitting down here you can put attention to people and it works.  When you develop yourself and when you touch the depth of your divinity such a person can cure people just by a glance.  You become so powerful, all these powers are within you, the only thing you have to bring the Spirit into your life, you have to become the Spirit.  And the last but not the least is that you enjoy the joy, you enjoy the joy that is the Spirit.

Joy has no duality, it is not happiness and unhappiness.  It’s just joy, it cannot be described it can only be enjoyed.  It has no words, it cannot be defined but when you enjoy you just feel that you are enjoying.  Anything you enjoy, anything you see you can enjoy.  Now, for example, there is a beautiful carpet here, supposing I look at it and I haven’t got this power to see through the Spirit, then I start thinking about it.  I start thinking how much it must have cost, from where it must have come.  I never see it actually I’m thinking.  When can I buy this or if it is mine there's greater headache thinking oh I should have insured it, all kinds of things. 

But in the case when the Kundalini rises she gives you a first stage or a first step, what we call as thoughtless awareness which we can call in Sanskrit as nirvichar samadhi where you watch something and you become thoughtless.  You see something beautiful you become thoughtless.  There are no thoughts, one thought rises fall, another thought rises falls.  We are all the time jumping on the cusps of the thought.  But when you are a realized soul you see something beautiful just your thoughts stop and the joy of that creation whatever is there starts pouring into you like a lake which is absolutely still, not a ripple, then all that is created around it is reflected completely.  In the same way, the mind becomes absolutely peaceful, you become a peaceful personality and this thoughtless awareness is the sign that you are not in the future, you are not in the past but you are in the present.  Because thoughts come to us from a past or may come from future but here you are in the present and that’s how you grow.

The second stage that  ( …. faulty section of video) … powers.  This is what awaits us.  You are all seekers here and a new category of people you are described by William Blake that there will be people of God will be born in those days and they will become godly.  The time has come but be careful, it’s not a mental achievement, it’s not an emotional achievement, it is a natural living achievement of the evolutionary process.  And such a person becomes extremely dynamic, tireless, extremely magnetic and compassionate.  It’s such a beautiful combination and you start enjoying yourself the best.  

So many came on this Earth as realized souls but they couldn’t achieve mass evolution.  It always happened in an evolutionary state that one fish came out first, then few came and then shoals of them.  In the same way, now the time is for all of you to have mass Realization.  This is the modern Sahaja Yoga but Sahaja Yoga has been practised since long by Zen, by Tao by Nath (…unclear) in India, so many have done that but now the time has come for mass Realization and you should not miss it.  It’s very important and I hope today again we’ll achieve that state, what we call as the state of the Spirit. 

Of course, I would like you again to ask me some questions, like yesterday I was really very much happy to hear such beautiful questions they asked, so positive.  They are real seekers I felt and yesterday we had also very good results.  So I will be very happy if you could ask me some questions, I’ll answer them but even if I answer your question it doesn’t mean that it’s a guarantee that you’ll get your Realization.  The realization has nothing to do with mental activity.  This Kundalini as you have heard yesterday is the pure desire within us, all other desires are not pure because today I want to have this then tomorrow I want to have that and according to the economic laws wants are not satiable in general. So there’s something wrong in our wants also that we go on jumping from one to another, once we get first want that we have is finished as soon as we get it, we don’t enjoy then we jump to another.  But Kundalini is the power of pure desire and if you have the pure desire to achieve that you all can have it.

May God bless you. 

Shri Mataji: Talking talking too much.  So you can ask me questions.  Yes, please.

Seeker: For this to work do you have to be a vegetarian?

Shri Mataji: No not at all.  There are no ' isms’  in Sahaja Yoga.  Depends on … some people have to take more carbohydrates and some have to take more proteins.  So whatever is the need of the body we should have, after all, what’s the use of saving the chickens?  I can’t give them Realization can I?  There is no hard and fast rule, the only thing is when you get your Realization you yourself know what is good for you.  I don’t have to tell you.  Like yesterday I told you that if you have a snake in your hand and if I tell you there’s a snake and it’s darkness you may say no no it’s a rope.  But let there be little light and you throw it away without my telling you.  You become your own master, your own guru.  All these things are outside.

Seeker: ( … unclear)

Sahaja Yogi: Is it possible when you become clearer in yourself to rise to different planes to get away from the mundane existence?

Shri Mataji: Of course that’s what it is.  I mean you don’t rise from the Mother Earth but you rise within yourself definitely, no doubt absolutely.  You have seen the saints you see they never committed any mistakes, they never created any nonsensical things. Why?  They had that highest plane and that’s what you have to achieve, that’s what I am saying.  That’s all within yourself.

Seeker: ( …. unclear)

Sahaja Yogi: When you open up like that is it possible for outside entities to enter into you?

Shri Mataji: No they’ll run away.  Outside entities just run away from divine people, they won’t come near you at all.  If you open up what you are opening up is light not darkness, they just run away.  That’s how people get cured of mental problems.  As with the light darkness disappears that same thing happens to you, there’s nothing to be afraid of.

Seeker: ( ……  unclear)

Sahaja Yogi: If I am the Spirit and the Kundalini is in the sacrum bone where is the soul?

Shri Mataji: It’s a long story.  Should need another lecture for it.  In short, I’ll tell you the soul is in seven (….  unclear) is attached to our centres from the back side and it reflects on our cells.  There’s a reflector and in the cell, there’s a little part where it is reflected and that is controlled, like a remote control, by the soul.  But recently we have really discovered something great that when you get realization you’ll find round round round round things like that clusters, not only one but many sometimes and sometimes one like that.  And also see also commas like that, shiny commas, these commas are the vibrations of Divine, what you call chaitanya or brahma or this all-pervading power.  But these round round things that you see are the dead souls. 

Now recently one of our scientists has sent us the photograph of the reflection on the cells, is exactly the same that you see.  Gradually all these things are coming to express.  Now somebody might say I don’t believe in dead souls.  ( … unclear) are.  They hang around, dissatisfied souls, they are there, so many diseases are caused only because of them.  But if you know how to make yourself pure they’ll run away.  Before you say I don’t believe or believe, it’s blindness, but afterwards, it’s a fact, you find out.  You also find out how to remove them, how to get rid of them.  When you become the master you can do it.  The only thing after getting Realization you must respect your Realization, you must respect your personality and you must develop it.  For that, you have to come in the collective because today’s Sahaja Yoga is for the collective and not for a single person.  Formally, when I read these books I get a shock really the way you had to go to jungles, you had to stay in loneliness, then you had to live without food, then you go to the Himalayas in that cold.  You enter into some cave, take out all your clothes and actually you die, I mean how do you get moksha I don’t know.  I myself would hate anyone going through all that.

It’s very simple, sitting on your chair you get your Realization, you don’t have to do all these things, you have done it all this before, that’s why you are here.

Seeker: ( …. unclear)

Sahaja Yogi: When you get your Realization can you sort of getting in touch with the knowledge of what you ought to be doing in this life?

Shri Mataji: In touch with what?

Sahaja Yogi: The knowledge of what you ought to be doing.

Shri Mataji: Of course. You get (  …. unclear) into the absolute and you know what you have to do absolutely.  I don’t have to tell you, you just don’t do that and you don’t do wrong things at all, just you don’t do and if you try you lose your vibrations.  All right now should we have the Realization?

( … unclear)  feel guilty about anything at this moment.  Forget if someone has told you you are a sinner or this and that, I always say such people who tell you you are a sinner must be greater sinners than any.  You are not to feel guilty for anything.  After all, you are human beings and you should commit mistakes it’s all right you are not God.  So it’s all right, so don’t condemn yourself.  In the West ( …. unclear) really have this problem that people feel very guilty all the time for everything, I mean the language itself starts with sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry and the phone also.  If you say we used to say I beg your pardon when we were of your age and here nowadays people just go on saying sorry sorry sorry, what are you sorry for?  

When you feel guilty this centre here catches very badly and it’s very dangerous for you, left side gives you diseases like angina and all lethargic organs.  Apart from that, you get spondylitis and all these troubles.  So I would request you first of all to completely forgive yourself because we have to enter into the kingdom of God so how can you be guilty.  Have full confidence in, that you are going to get your Realization, have full confidence, don’t doubt yourself at all.  So many start thinking, oh how could I get, after all, I have done this wrong that wrong, finished.  Because this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness, an ocean of forgiveness so you cannot commit any mistake which cannot be dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.  Have faith in it.

The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general.  Whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything, it’s a myth.  Some people say difficult not to forgive, means what?  What are you doing?  You are playing into wrong hands.  By not forgiving others you are playing into wrong hands and you are torturing yourself while the person who has really troubled you is enjoying himself.  So what’s the use of not forgiving?  As soon as you forgive you’ll find your, half of the load will be finished but don’t think of people who you have to forgive because that’s also painful.  I don’t want to have any pains.  I want you to be very comfortable and happy.  So what you have to do is to just say in general I forgive everyone. 

Yesterday there were so many who did not forgive they didn’t feel the cool breeze on the right hand especially.  So I had to tell them now you go and tell every tree and every flower, I have forgiven everyone in general and it just worked.  So please remember if you don’t say then maybe Self Realisation could be little halfway.  So just forgive everyone just listen to me and forgive everyone in general, just say I forgive everyone.  Don’t think about who you have to forgive, who has tortured you, forget it.  In this present moment just forget the past.  These are the only two simple conditions we have to fulfil.

Now as we are going to take the help from the Mother Earth we can take out our shoes, need not take out your socks but shoes, just take out your shoes and put both your feet apart from each other, as you know there’s a left and a right, two powers.  Left is the power of desire, of ordinary desire, and the right is the power of action.  First, we’ll show you what we have to do, how we have to awaken our own Kundalini and then we’ll close our eyes.

So first please put both the feet apart from each other, each other.  Now one must know that I cannot force it on you, no not at all, because I respect your freedom.  It cannot be forced, I respect your individuality.  You have to ask for it.  I will never force it on you and those who do not want should not be here, they can leave.  Those who want it should know that I cannot force it.

So now please put your left hand towards me which means that you desire to have your Self Realisation.  Just the left hand like this, comfortably, sit comfortably, not too much with a slouch or too much back, but just in the centre comfortably.  Do not bend your neck too much or push it back till I tell you.  And then we have to use the right hand for our action on to different centres. 

So first we put it on our heart because in the heart resides the Spirit.  Now we put this right hand on the upper portion of our abdomen, the upper portion of the abdomen because this is the centre of our mastery which is created there by the great prophets and masters which is to be awakened.  Then we take down our right hand into the lower portion of the abdomen, we work only on the left side, the lower portion of the abdomen, press it hard, this is the centre of pure knowledge, the knowledge that is expressed through our central nervous system by which we know what is real and what is unreal, by which we know how to handle this power which is flowing through us.

Now again we raise our hand higher on to the guru principle, the mastery principle that is on the left-hand side of the upper portion of the abdomen and presses it hard.  Then we take our hand on our heart.  Then we take it in the corner of our neck and our shoulder as I told you that this centre is mostly caught in the West, we really feel guilty for nothing at all.  Then we turn our head to our right, hold it right there.  Now we take our right hand on top of our forehead across and put down our head slowly resting on this hand as much as we can go down.  We take this hand here because this is the centre where we forgive everyone in general.  

Now we take back this hand on the back side of our head and push back our head and this is the centre we have where, without feeling guilty, without counting our mistakes, we have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading divine Power.  Push back your head as far as possible.  Now please stretch your hand fully, stretch your palm, I mean the palm, and please put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.  Now put down your head as much as you can.  If you push back your fingers nicely, then there’s a nice pressure, good pressure on your scalp.  Push down your head.  Now move your hand slowly clockwise seven times so that your scalp moves, not the hand so much.  Press the palm, centre palm by pushing your fingers outward.  Put down your head.

Now ….  That’s why we have to do, take out your hands, now please remember now you have to close your eyes, you can take out your spectacles and till I tell you please don’t open your eyes.  Put both the feet away from each other and put your left hand towards me.  Don’t move it, keep it there and now close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.  Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself, like a computer you ask, you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji whichever it suits you.

Mother, am I the Spirit?  Ask this question in your heart three times.   Mother, am I the Spirit?  Now if you are the Spirit you are your master.  So now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and ask another fundamental question.  

Mother am I my own master?  Ask three times.  Mother am I my own master?  I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.  You have to ask for it.  So now please take your right hand the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.  Here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals.

Mother, please give me pure knowledge.  Say this six times, say it from your heart.  Mother, please give me pure knowledge.  As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising.  So we have to nourish our upper centres with our self-confidence.

So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and here you have to say with full self-confidence ten times.  Mother, I am my own master.  Mother I am my own master, say it please ten times, please.  Say it with self-confidence.  I have told you that the fundamental truth about you is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, you are not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

So now please raise your right hand on your heart, please put it on your heart and here you have to say with again full confidence in yourself twelve times, twelve times. 
Mother, I am the Spirit.  Mother I am the Spirit, say it twelve times, please.  This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of love, is the ocean of bliss, but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and as I told you, you cannot commit any mistake which cannot be completely dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness.

So now please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.  Here with full confidence, you have to say sixteen times.  Mother, I am not guilty at all.  Mother, I am not guilty at all.  Please say it sixteen times, turn your head to your right full.

Now I’ve already told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything, but if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.  So it is a myth, so please raise your right hand onto your forehead across and now put down your head nicely on it.  Here now please say it with full confidence from your heart, from the core of your heart.  Mother, I forgive everyone in general.  Please say it because if you don’t say it I told you I had a bad time yesterday.  Please say it, it’s not how many times, it’s from your heart.  Now without feeling guilty, without thinking of your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the divine Power.  So now please put your right hand on the back side of your head, again I say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction.  Push back your head as much as you can, push back.  

Here you have to say, Oh divine Power if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.  You have to say, Oh divine Power if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me.  Say if from your heart, not how many times, but again from the core of your heart you have to just say it, push back your head as much as you can.

Now please stretch your hand fully, your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, put down your head as far as possible.  Press it hard by pushing out your fingers, outward, you push them out and press your scalp very hard.  Here again, I cannot give you Self-realisation unless and until you ask for it because I respect your freedom.  So here you have to ask seven times moving your hand clockwise, slowly moving the scalp.  You have to say Mother please give me my Self Realisation.

(Shri Mataji blows into the microphone).

Now take down your hand.  Please open your eyes slowly and put both the hands towards me.  Watch me without thinking if you can.  Now please put your right hand towards me and the left hand put down your head and with the left hand, you can feel the cool or the hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.  Now you just watch, do not doubt yourself.  It’s not air conditioning, it just comes out of your head.

Now it could be very far away, could be very near but you shouldn’t put your hand on top of your head, little away from it, move your hand and see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

Now please put a left hand towards me, put down your head again and see with the right hand if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.  Please put down your head and see for yourself.  Some people get it very far, some people get it very close but just move your hand, see for yourself.  It is you who has to certify.  Now don’t think about it, it just works.  Have full confidence, don’t doubt yourself.

Now, again once more with the right hand and bend your head and see for yourself.  Now just raise both your hands towards the sky, push back your head and ask the question, Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?  Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God?  Mother, is this the Brahma?  Ask any one of these questions, three times, anyone.  Three times, push back your head and ask the question from your heart.

Now take down your hands, I am getting a cool breeze from you.  So please take down, now put your hands like this.  You’ll feel very relaxed, very relaxed.  Your pupils will be dilated to show that you are relaxed.  Now those who have felt the cool breeze on their fingertips or in their hands or from their fontanel bone area, or maybe the hot breeze, it will become cool later, please raise both your hands.

Again you didn’t feel today (…unclear).

Alright, may God bless you all, I bow to all of you.  I bow to all of you, you are now saints but respect your Realization and you have to come to the collective in a very humble manner.  As a nail, if it is cut, it doesn’t grow any more, in the same way, Sahaja Yoga you have to do it in collective.  You have to come in the collective, luckily now we have a very good centre and we have very good Sahaja yogis here.  We have got Micheal Sweet who has been a leader in Sahaja Yoga in Melbourne, who is here, who is going to be the leader to help you.  The leader doesn’t mean it’s a myth, it’s a myth.  So don’t think leader means some sort of a dominating personality but he knows all about it and he’ll guide you very well and he’ll help you and please accept it whatever he tells you and then try for yourself.  I’m sure all of you will grow very well.  Next year I hope to come again to meet you all.

May God bless you.

You can also write to me and the letters would be directed to me, don’t have to worry.

Thank you very much.

Again if you want to meet me I’ll be very happy.  What’s the matter with you, yesterday also you didn’t get isn’t it, these two, you were here yesterday?  No there were two girls sitting on the same seats.

Sahaja Yogi: It might be the seat Mother.

Shri Mataji: This is Michael Sweet.

(Shri Mataji begins to speak to people who come to meet her.  Unclear from here on).
