Puja in Pune (extracts), India, 3 December 1990.

So, welcome to all the Sahaja Yogis from abroad. So we start from today our Maharashtra Tour, which you can see is full of these hills and dales. Also, the atmosphere is going to be extremely rustic. Of course the comforts of this place have not been up to the mark, but next year it will be much better, I'm sure. We have decided to purchase even this plot of land, but as you know we have a land on top, there on the hill at the top. That's one of the highest peaks in this area. That land we have already purchased, and we are going to have an Ashram there, and this will be the place used for parking. I hope you like the atmosphere here and the surroundings, the nature.

People in Maharashtra are blessed by great saints and people who were Naths, like Gyaneshwara; and that's why they have a tremendous base of spirituality. But still they are to be guided to get their Self Realization. As you know that without spirituality, the life is very much in, is in imbalance. It does not have a totality of enjoyment. I don't know if there is any enjoyment otherwise also; because if you just live with your machineries and materialism, they cannot give you joy. And that's what you have discovered, the emptiness of life. And that's the reason you want spirituality, to give a complete expression to your personality, which has happened. Luckily it has happened. I'm very happy to see so many people who have felt it. And this is what has to be understood by Indians also, because they think that you people are so well off materially and while they are not, they are spiritually well-off and you are materially well-off. And both the things are so important. The foundation has to be strong, of spirituality, and then you can build whatever type of building you want to build on top of that. But if you do not have that foundation, then the whole thing collapses. Like a tree grows, and it doesn't touch the source of its nourishment, it will definitely collapse. This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that you are touching the source of your nourishment, nourishment to your civilization. And once this nourishment starts flowing, you see what's wrong in those countries where people have gone headlong, gone to the extremes, and what they are suffering. The people here have no idea about it. Also in this country of ours we have lots of problems because people are so simple, very vulnerable. But dealing with the problems of the West, I feel that there's no way out but Sahaja Yoga. As many as we can save, we should try to save them. Whatever may be the achievements in the West, they are going to boomerang, and they may destroy the whole society.

So when you are starting the first day here you should ask for spirituality, the blessings of spirituality, but also the promise that you will help others who are getting drowned into the dry materialism of the West. That's a very important task you have to do. You are all enjoying this beautiful life, and you are at peace with yourself, but this wine of spirituality has to be shared, otherwise life becomes very selfish, self-centered. I know you are frightened of those people, because you think you may catch from them. In this Tour I hope most of you will be made badha-proof and fearless. As I told you, you have to touch your depth. If you live with superficiality, any superficiality in you must be thrown away, then you will sink down. There are all kinds of superficialities which have come to us as a "blessing" of this Western civilization, as also in India we have another. But as I'm talking to you I'll, I would like to tell you about the superficialities that we have in the West.

First of all, the another style is our norms and ideas. Actually it's all a mental activity, as I've told you that the whole art of the West is finished. We cannot have a Rembrandt any more. We cannot have a Michelangelo any more. The reason is, criticism of this art has been so much in the modern times that nobody wants to produce anything which will be criticized, and now only situation left is that our critics are criticizing critics, that's all; no art, because they have no work to do. So this mental activity of putting everybody down and mastering that art, is very dangerous and extremely destructive. And this is what is happening I feel, in the field of every kind of activity: industry, music, art, everything that you find; buildings, any enterprise, even politics. Everything has become so superficial that you have to be prepared for facing all kinds of oppositions and troubles. But still, as you have your own depth, you can master them all by your tranquility, by your temperament, and by your powers which you have got. When you are not afraid of that society, and when you have that tranquility within you and the courage, I'm sure you can do a lot. Of course we have some very dynamic people in Sahaja Yoga in the West, and very dynamic women also in the West. What may come they never deter, and they have worked very hard to do everything possible to see that Sahaja Yoga is established. So they should be your ideals, and all of you should try to follow them and do the best.

This Tour is a festival for us. It's, of course I say it's a pilgrimage but there are no signs of pilgrimage it looks, because if you see the pilgrims, horrible they look, while you are looking like roses, all of you. So it's a festival for us and you have to feel that festivity within your heart, that joy within your heart, and small, small things you should not worry, because these things cannot be provided in all the places. Gradually we'll be building ashrams in all the places wherever you have been visiting, but you know how difficult it is, in those days where the India is passing through such a bad phase for so many years, where everything is delayed. So the attitude should be that: "We have come here for our ascent." We have to work out everything with that attitude, that we have come here for our ascent, and every moment of our ascent is a festive occasion. Everything is a festival. If you understand that, I am sure you will see the beauty in everything, you will enjoy everything, whatever may be the rustic style. Maybe you may not like the color of these lights, I think, because you may not enjoy it so much. You might get much better things in your own country. But whatever it is, it's not your conditioning that should stop you from enjoying. So please remember that you are now the member of the universal society, and we cannot have our conditionings to mar our happiness and joy. I want you to enjoy this trip fully, absolutely, in a way that you have never enjoyed anything before.

May God bless you.

[English translation from Marathi]

Yesterday, I have told you in detail (“savistara”) that we have got so much heritage (“sampada”) of spirituality (“adhyatma”), you should have some appreciation (“kadara”) for that. If we are not having respect (“kadara”) towards ourselves, then how will we be appreciative (“kadara”) of our heritage (“sampada”). Every person in India, in that also a person from Maharashtra is extremely (“atyanta”) an instrument (“putala”) a of God’s love, we should understand it in this manner. We ourselves don’t know about ourselves. If we are staying in villages (Khedyat”) and are facing lot of troubles, then we feel that we are lower beings (“Kaḥpadārtha” - कःपदार्थ). It is not like that, we are going to be utilised very much, only thing is that we should remember (“Lakṣāta” - लक्षात) certain things. The first thing is that we should be completed awakened (“jaagrut”) about religion (“dharma”). Every religion that is prevalent in our country or in any other country, in all the countries we can say that, it is only been mechanized (“yantrikaran”) or in all it has been made as a means to earn money. This cannot be religion (“dharma”). God does not understand money, cannot understand bank, nothing. If someone asks me to write a cheque, I donot understand it, I ask someone else to write it and I will sign it. The people who loot you here of your money in the name of God, to give them even a single penny (“Kavadi”) is wrong, this is the first thing. And any person who wears a saffron roble and comes, we start prostrating (“lotangan”) in front of them. That person would have come after being released from jail and is now wearing a saffron robe, this thought does not come in anyone’s mind. We directly start, the people from villages who are simple (“sadhe”) and straight forward (“saral”), if they say “see, if you give so much money, good will happen to you”, you will start giving money to such a person. Sometime back, I had gone to a village, everyone started coming “we have to have see (“darshan”) Shri Mataji”; one women brought, she gave me twenty five paise. I told her that I don’t take money; She said okay, then I will give you one rupee Shri Mataji. Means it does not go out of their minds, it is fixed in their minds that money has to be offered to God. But does the God understand your money? All this that is filled in our minds should be taken out firstly, that any person who asks money, such person is definitely not closer to God. This should be made to understand to all the villagers. We have many simple (“saadhe”) innocent (“bhole”) people and that is why anywhere if you just place a stone, offered vermilion (“sindoor”) to it and someone sits in front of it, to make money. Anyone who comes and goes will start prostrating (“lotangan”) in front of it, offering two paise to it. On that Dusiya Saraswati and Saints have done a lot of work and have told these people out (“shivya ghatlya”) have done everything, but no one remembers it. Saints have, there was a Brahmin called Dusiya Saraswati, he used to go and take on (jhorpur”) such person and take a stone and throw it off. 20.05 secs

Eknath (a saint) was troubled a lot by people because he had lunch at a Marwad (a caste in India) house. Do monks (“sadhu”) and saints (“sant”) have any caste? Who is a Marni, who is a Brahmin? And in our scriptures (“shastras”) if you see, even if you get into it a bit deeper (“dunkun pahne”), you will come to know that Shri Rama’s character (“charitra”) was written by Valmiki, a Kohli (a caste of fisherman). That Kohli had written the character of Shri Rama, not any Brahmin. So all the madness that is within us regarding caste and creed should be removed. There is no meaning to this, it is an indication of stupidity ("murkhapana"). It is said about the Devi “Yaa devi Sarva Bhooteshu Jaati Roopena Samsthitha”. What does this caste mean? What is a caste? Caste means something within you which you like or is the essence of the fertile (“उब्जदस्त”) intelligence (“buddhi”) that is the caste. If any person is searching for God then that person is a Brahmin. In that Das Ganu (name of a person) says “Amha shi mhanati Brahmana, Amhi jaanile nahi Brahma, Amhi Kasale Brahmana?” – means “I call myself a Brahmin, I have not known the Brahma principle within me, then what kind of Brahmin am I?” He himself being a Brahmin said so. So all this kind (“prakar”) pf caste and creed should be forgotten. In Sahaja Yoga we do not believe in any type of caste or creed. We do not believe in widowhood (“वैधव्या” – “vaidhavyā”), first thing. Women are so learned (“vidhvaan”), men are never widowed (“सधवा” – “sadhva”). By doing this w have done a lot of tyranny on women (“attyachar”). Performing atrocity (“attyachar”) can never be righteousness (“dharma”). Any kind of atrocity (“attyachar”) is Iniquity (“adharma”) and any kind of injustice (“An'yāya”) is also Iniquity (“adharma”). So when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you need to bear in mind that all this nonsensical (“ula daali”) things, due to which our country has become a hell, we don’t believe in such things and will not believe in such things. 22.15 secs

In the case of caste, we have so much terrible type (“Bhayaṅkara prakāra” “भयंकर प्रकार”) here and in case of marriages there is no other duty (“Kartabagārī” “कर्तबगारी”) now. We don’t have to go to Simhagadh (name of a fort in Maharashtra which means the “Lion’s fort”), we do not have to win any fort, nothing like that. So what will we do sitting idly, we will arrange our sons and daughters marriages, only that much, there is no other work than that. It is very surprising, when I was born, that time I realised that they put me in 96 Kuli Maratha community (“Śahāṇṇava Kul” “शहाण्णव कुळ”). I asked, why did you put me in the 96 Kuli Maratha community? In that clan all are drunkards and they torture their women so much; and in case of marriages, it can happen only within the same clan, the 96 Kuli Maratha community; an all are useless (“bekaar”) people. If any girl is given to a well-educated (“Suśikṣita”) boy then finished. There will be so much torturing of the girl [literal meaning of (“Āṭā piṭā”) is beating of the dough; and literal meaning of (“Jhōrpūrnā”) is strongly]; what is this kind of behaviour? Is this 96 Kuli Maratha community made by God? Everyone’s nose, face looks the same, everyone’s questions are similar, when the way of laughing and way of talking is similar, when everyone are the children of the same mother, how can it be said that this person cannot marry that person, that person cannot marry this person, then taking dowry, this that, all this horrible things in our caste/community. Sahaja Yoga has come to make this all pure (“Nirmal”). Everything will be cleaned and how much trouble it was you see. Today it is your daughter and you are facing the trouble, tomorrow it will be your son and you will trouble others similarly. Although, Sahaja Yoga is for sages (“sadhu”) and saints (“sant”), it is not for Ascetics (“sanyastha”). Being in the society, helping society progress, helping in progressing the thoughts of the people in the society, Sahaja Yoga is such a nutrition (“pōṣaka”) that assists the society. 24.16 secs

Then in your life anyone who calls themselves as Sahaja Yogis, if they are also having a narrow vision (“sankuchit drishthi” “संकुचित दृष्टि”), then they need to understand that they have not yet understood Sahaja Yoga. This is a work of the world, we have set out to unify the world, instead you are still at we are from this village, we are from that village, ours this, that and has this benefitted in any way? Has this benefitted anyone? What is the benefit from this, you need to see this first. Has anyone benefitted by marrying someone from the same community? Day before yesterday, one woman came to fight with me on this issue. I showed her 10 of her relatives, I showed her each one of them, you see your relations by marriage (“Sōyarīka”). But Dnyaneshwar has mentioned in Pasaydaan (written by Sant Dnyaneshwar) that “Techi Soyarika hoti te” which means “it was your relations by marriage”. These are your relations by marriage (“soyarika”). What was mentioned in Pasaydan is Sahaja Yoga. Sages (“sadhu”), saints (“sant”) have not accepted this; how much they were tortured because they were the children of ascetics (“sanyasi”). Ascetics had children, did anyone’s father (“Kōṇācyā bāpā nī sāṅgitalē”) come and tell them this? How much they have been tortured, how much Tukaram was tortured, how much was Eknath tortured that he had to go and eat at a low caste (“mahara”) person’s place. All these things while staying on the land of sages (“sadhu”), saints (“sant”), we should behave like them. Look at their discourses (“abhanga”), what have they told, what has Tukaram said to Vithala “Tu mahar jhalas he bara jhala” which means “It is good that you became a lower caste born”. Vithala didn’t come to punish him for that. “Zala Mahar Pandharinath” which means Pandarinath which is Vithala has become a lower caste born. He has said such a big thing, but does it get into anyone’s brains what he has said? If Pandharinath (Vithal) can be a lower caste born, then who are you? Just singing the songs (“bhajans”) of sages (“sadhu”), saints (“sant”) and playing the beats (“टाल कुटायची”) but the essence (“Svārasya”) of it should come in to you and everyone worked on the superstition (“Andhaśrad'dhā”), on darkness (“andhate”). Dnyaneshwar told about the higher being (“varchya payrya”) and then said (out of frustration), I don’t want to do this and then took his entrancement (“samadhi”). Where will these idiots (“mahamurkha”) listen, sometime ages later they may read these books, now they are reading these books. 26.42 secs

Now in Maharashtra they have a tour, they look at you all as people sitting next to God as for them Maharashtra is a very pious place. They really consider Maharashtra as a Great country (“Maharashtra”) and they consider people of Maharashtra (“Maharashtrians”) as God. Because you have so much traditions (“parampara”), you are sitting in the land of saints, you were born in such a place, so how much enlightened you all would be, is what they think. But it is always about following someone else (“Yērē mājhyā māgalyā” “येरे माझ्या मागल्या”), again it is the same thing. Now yesterday, everyone’s Vishuddhi chakra, this chakra, had caught up. Why, I know, because of tobacco. In Maharashtra, cannot be without tobacco, even if it give cancer or people die. From where this unintelligence (“Avadasā”) has come in Maharashtra, I don’t understand. The poor sages (“sadhu”), saints (“sant”) have all told that you should not consume intoxicating substances (“madak padarth”). Sai Nath had burnt all the tobacco and had drank it, like Shiva (Shankara), but still everyone is sitting on tobacco. Wherever they go they consume tobacco, even while going to Vithala they eat tobacco before leaving. Vithala does not like tobacco. Vithala sits on the Vishuddhi Chakra and then why do you eat tobacco and go to (worship) him? The accessibility (“gamya”) in it should be there, you should hold the gist (“sara”) of it. Then you say Mataji we believe in God so much, now only a woman was saying that she prays to the Goddess so much. [Shri Mataji] ‘And what else?’ [The lady] ‘Nothing much, the house owner drinks alcohol sometimes.’ [Shri Mataji] ‘Is that so?’ [The lady] ‘Then they go and be on their fours (“choughade” “चौघडे”)’. [Shri Mataji]  ‘And your (husband)?’ [The lady] ‘He has the hobby to play cards.’ [Shri Mataji] ‘Is that so? So after paying cards, what do you do after going to the Goddess?’ [The lady] ‘Aarti, Goddesses Aarti.’ This impurity (“ashuddhata”) has increased by far in our society, this is not acceptable to the Goddess, all such things are not acceptable to the Goddess. Then you will get a rap (“phatke”), then when you get a rap, you will ask why did this happen to me? I am such a devotee of God, I am such a devotee of Shiva, I am such a devotee of Dattatreya, how did this happen to me?  Hence, firstly you should get connected with them. Devotees of Dattatreya should definitely be having a trouble of the stomach, take it in writing, I am not lying. Anyone who is having a stomach problem, ask them ‘are you a devotee of Dattatreya’. ‘Yes.’ They should have the troubles of the stomach because Dattatreya, is the deity residing around this area of the stomach which is the place of our righteousness (“dharma”) which is called the Void, we don’t have a photo here so you can’t see it. You go on chanting Datta, Datta, when you are not connected with him. In reality Datta means Mohammed Sahib as well, Muslims will also have the trouble of the stomach. Chanting Mohamed, Mohamed, Muslims will not get it. (You are) required to be connected. 30.04 secs

But even they are not able to understand it sometime, that we believe in God so much and then how is this coming on us? How are we in such trouble? The reason for that is that you have still not understood, Mohammed Sahib has told this specifically that such a time will come which he has called as “Qiyama”, means resurrection (“Punarut'thāna”), resurrection will happen, at that time your hands will speak. He has spoken about Sahaja Yoga completely. One such person will come who will tell everything, everything was told. Muslims are not someone else, Hindus are not someone else, everyone are our own people. But when you do not know the path, you see it this way only, it is the same for the blind. Like blind people cannot see green and red, similarly that we are all one, is not seen. That is why this fighting, what all is happening. Does this have any meaning? Rudeness (“bhankudarpana” “भांकुदरपना”) in Maharashtra is now like the fifth is being worshiped (“Pācavīlā pujalā āhē” “पाचवीला पुजला आहे”). The other thing is brotherhood (“Bhā'ūbandakī”). Anyone who comes forward, then (others) start complaining to me (“kāna bharaṇē”). I will close my ears now, I said. I understand everything, no one knows that. They will come and say this person is like this, terrible politician (“bhayankar rajkarnia”) Mataji, please be careful of person. I said that I know more than you know about this person, I will tell you everything. They will look at me with their eyes bulging out as if to ask, how did you know? I know about it, don’t tell me about useless things. This person’s (views) on that person, that person’s (views) on this, don’t ask about it. Then how will Sahaja Yoga expand, but in these people one thing is not there, not at all, once they come to Sahaja yoga, they are so humble, they are so humble, that we get a big thing, we do not have any imagination about this, never fighting, no strings (“tanta”), never speaking about each other, they know I don’t like it and whatever is there speak clearly on the face, not behind the back. 32.10 secs

These people who do not have the people to follow their footsteps (“paaya”), they do not have the role of the saints behind them, in whose places there were no kings like Shri Rama, there were no brave people like Shivaji in their places, they have come up so much and where are we still? They have got so much, then why we should not get it? Our past heritage (“poorva pithida”) is so big, we are people who have sat on the throne (“simhasana”) and how are we behaving? Useless people act foolishly (“binde”) and by being foolish they have lost their essence (sattva”). In this Maharashtra we have to do a lot of awakening and it will happen because Maharashtra has this heritage (“sampada”) that is not present anywhere else in this world, that is why I am putting in so much efforts over here, that is why I was born in Maharashtra and am putting in so much efforts through these years. That is why everyone needs to understand what their responsibilities are, what are the responsibilities of Maharashtra. Even if you are staying in villages, you are uneducated, still your state within is very high. So you need to achieve that state and you need to show the whole world that an ordinary farmer from Maharashtra is also of a very high calibre. You know how to talk, but like fools again you start reading the Mahatmyas. By reading what are you going to get, sincerely, sincerely (“parayna”), week after week, has anyone got anything from this. Whichever village you go, there is a weekly programme of Mataji (a weekly ritual performed to please the Goddess in the villages). What happens by doing the weekly, is it benefitting in any way? Then you need to get your awakening and after being awakened you need to know why you are having this condition? Why did we get into this trouble? And to get your awakening is not difficult, it is a possession (“sampada”) inbuilt within you, the complete power is within you, what is yours needs to be given to you. This is yours, it needs to be given to you. There is nothing for me to give and take here, there is no favour on my side. Does Mother do any favour (to its children)? You believe, that you have believed. But Mother does for her own happiness. Now the speciality of this city is that, of this place is that, the land we have taken is only on seeing the vibrations (“chaitanya”) and then we got this land, now (people) are going to come and stay here, then on behalf (“vatine”) of you all I have told them that we have taken this place. Then these are all the devotees of the Goddess, so they need to be taken care of. There is place of the Goddess here and in front of them we should show them how deep you all are. You can prosper in all aspects, only thing is that you need to get into your depth. Otherwise when you will achieve prosperity, you will go and drink alcohol or you will do some dirty work. 35.30 secs

First thing that needs to happen, is that your inner power is awakened. You should have this desire in your mind that we need to get our awakening. Today you have come for the Pooja, in the Pooja vibrations (“Chaitanya”) flow. Usually we don’t allow people who are not Sahaja Yogis. Those who have not got their awakening (“Chaitanya”), we do not allow them to come to the Pooja, because they cannot withstand (“jamat”) it, they cannot bear (“jhepat”) it. But if you are sitting in humility, everyone will benefit from the Pooja and everyone will feel alright. So you have to sit in humility that we need to get achieve something, this you need to remember and what you have possession (“sampada”) which is inbuilt that itself is going to work out. After that you come and tell me. Then this letter I will get that ‘Mataji, we are swimming in the ocean of joy.’ To give this, I am moving around villages. Today this hard work is going on since 20 years, now have to see how much work happens in Maharashtra. In that way, in Delhi, in the villages near Delhi a lot of work has been done. Similarly, it should happen here because this is the land of saints and it is your inheritance (“varasa”) and you need to satisfy (“tripta”) the saints. The saints should feel that these people have got what we have given to them. Just don’t blabber (“tondachi chad pat panjali”) and just playing the beats (“taal kutna”) is not required. The echo behind the beats that should come (“umathla”) from you and the arrangement for that is very easy. 37.03 secs

The people who are sitting in the sun can come and sit here, there is space here in the front, come and sit here. There is time for Pooja, come and sit here. You can come here and sit, there is space here, come in the front. 37.14 secs

[English] You can sit there, after all you are at a height.

[Marathi] Come and sit at the front. Come, like this sit in the front. Sit in the shade, it will take a long time for this. Don’t sit in the sun, congregation (“mandali”) don’t sit in the sun, don’t sit in the sun. Sit in the shade.

[English] It is a nice breeze blowing. Alright.

[Marathi] Now who is coming for the Pooja? 38.08 secs

[English] A Sahaja Yogi is asking a question to Shri Mataji: Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji responding to a question by Sahaja Yogi: Hmmm. 

A Sahaja Yogi is asking a question to Shri Mataji: Washing your feet.

Shri Mataji responding to a question by Sahaja Yogi: Yaaa (Yes). Shri Ganeshas. There are how, many children here I think.

[Hindi] Shri Mataji: There will be many children here. Can you check and come?

[Marathi] Shri Mataji: Small children between 5 to 10 years, come and sit here. 4 to 10 years. 

[English] A Sahaja Yogi talking in the background: Children 5 to 10 years old.

[English] Shri Mataji: 4 to 10.

[English] A Sahaja Yogi talking in the background: 4 to 10 all the children.[English] Shri Mataji: Sit down.
