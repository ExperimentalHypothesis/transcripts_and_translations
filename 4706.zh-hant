內在靈的力量的達致

印度Rahuri 1984年2月26日

我希望你們到目前為止和往後的旅程都很舒適。舒適的源頭是你的靈。當你的靈感到越舒適,外在的問題便不再重要了。你不會介意住在那裏、睡在那裏、吃什麽、做什麽。當這些粗糙的感官消失,你內在的精微感覺便會生長。這就是為什麽你們要來到這裏,你們在這裏克服時間、克服各種制約等等。我是指那些你死我活的競爭,這些競爭必須完全停止,決斷地停止,「外在(without)。」所以在這裏我們可以以「外在」的態度來作事。當你開始靜坐,這個「內在(within)」也可以做到,你們可以達至和平,那是所有人類必須擁有的,若我們想從毀滅中把地球拯救出來,必須要有和平。

你必定已經意識到,霎哈嘉瑜伽現在發展得很快,以很恰當的速度前進。我們必須保持裝備完備,令自己可以在即將橫掃全世界的偉大進化和改革過程中,成為其中一份子。

為此,我們要承擔起我們的工作,不要過平凡的生活,平凡的思維,這是非常重要的。我們都是極有潛質的人。還有,神的神性力量都在祝福我們。嘗試運用這個在你內裏的力量,與這個力量合一。漸漸地,你必須看到你重重的打擊你的身體、你的頭腦、你的自我,把它們雕琢得很漂亮,令你成長成你本來被創造的模樣。

至於其他事情,像我來到你的國家,我視我為你做最好的事情,就是當你來到「這個」國家時,令你感到你是屬於這個國家,你像從其化國家連根拔起。當你來到這裏,你是那麽昌盛。在這個國家,我是那麽努力,幸勤地工作,做各樣的事情,我的時間全花在與你們一起,不分白天晝夜,全時間的做每樣事情。在這裏,當我看到發生在你身上的事情時,我感到不可能成就太多事情。在這裏,你對這神聖的地方感到絶對放鬆。我想這種把你從別的國家連根拔起的想法必須放棄。我想就像你已經移居到這些國家,回到自己的本性一樣,但卻並未被移民法例所發現。

在這種情況下,我們必須改變策略,開始在這裏建立我們的靜室,我們的工作計劃,所以你們必須來到這裏,成就更多事情。你可以在這裏賺取你的生活。但你必須來到這裏,連續花兩至三個月,建立自己,令自己成長。因為我沒有想過在這裏可以成就得這樣好,因為我們已經嘗試了各種方法,所以這是我們這旅程最後的成果。

盡管我們在這裏的旅程和生活,充滿著各式各樣的危險,你們做得非常好。我必須說,當我看到你們時,我感到你們都很好,改善了很多。就像手錶,為了令你們對它有免疫力,你把他們放在荒謬的條件,他們變得沒有問題。就像這樣,現在你有了免疫力。他們被放在槽裏,徹底地被搖晃。正如你們昨天那樣,在巴士上被搖晃。跟著,他們被製造成讓水可以很快在他們身上流過。所有這些在這裏也被嘗試。我想你的免疫系統,對外在事物的反應,成長得很快。你們變成真正堅固永恆的個體,就如在這裏創造你們一樣,我非常高興看到你們的進展,這是我們來到這裏,已經達致的主要成果。

首先,注意力必須遠離金錢。錢是其中一個最大的問題。實際上,沒有人會相信,富裕的國家的人比印度人更金錢取向,雖然他們已經那樣發達。你看,那些發達國家的人比印度人更金錢取向,那是非常令人驚訝!當你看到他們是怎樣數算一分一毫,你是不能相信,他們真的是已經成長的人嗎。有時,他們比乞丐更壞。所以你必須遠離金錢。金錢是人們數算的可怕的東西,我的意思是數算神的名比數算錢好_______可怕的錢幣。

還有,我們對其他事物如對舒適有表面的執著。我並不認為這裏過的是舒適的生活,因為在這裏,你隨時要在晚上任何時間遷移。你不會遇見任何會奪取你的錢包或你的手鐲的人。你可以以你喜歡的行徑移動,沒有人會騷擾你。你不會遇見兩或三個酒鬼互相毆打,不會有這類事情發生。所以這裏的生活是很純樸。這是很大的成就。

若你想過那種你想過的舒適,你可以遲一點自己創造。我個人認為,太現代化並不適合這個地方。所以,令自己身體變成舒適的奴隸和奴役人這些無用的觀念,必須不要灌輸給他們。

在任何情況下,個人的衛生在這裏是很好的,但大眾的衛生必須向那些人講授。這種施予和接受的過程,我肯定必會運作得很好。還有事情在你內裏正在運作。我有很大的願望,希望你來到這個國家,居住一段時間之後,再回到自己的國家,你真的成長得更快。這比只有我探訪你的國家還好,有時我感到探訪你的國家,只是被負面能量轟炸。

另一點我要告訴你,你必須明白,你來到這裏,必須有些得益。沒有人會在你身上得到任何好處,所以你必須在這裏獲得某些益處。你是學生,所以你必須學到一些東西,嘗試發展紀律的意識。就像一個門徒,吸收四周所有一切_______這是什麽?這是怎樣?這是房子,那很美好。就像這樣。但若你繼續看些並不重要的事物,隨意說些與你無關的說話,所有這些必須放棄。因為你有太多時間,所以人們坐下,與你交談,說些無聊、難聴、無用的說話,不需要這樣。相反,還是保持沉默比較好,吸收更多自己的內裏。因為在這裏,人們沒有時間,他們不能交談,他們需要工作。但當你有時間,你便開始說些無聊的說話,這是非常錯誤的事情。

另一種談話是與自己,也說得太多。像你開始分析、批評,找別人錯處,不停的想..「啊!這樣會比較好。我傷害這裏太多......這種事情已經發生...。」所有這樣的事情進入你的腦海,這種與自己說的話也必須停止。耶穌基督稱他們為喃喃終日的靈,祂還說..「小心喃喃終日的靈。」但喃喃終日的靈存在於我們內裏,所以小心它們,不要聽信所有荒謬的言論,要保持警覺,這樣便能幫助你。整體上,我必須說這個旅程和之前的旅程,我都感到極大的喜樂,非常高興這些旅程可以為我帶來那麽多不可能發生但卻發生了的事情,亦把你的潛能帶到我面前,我為此感到很高興。無論如何,在這一年,在我們之間,已經形成了一種新的氣氛,那就是謙卑、寧靜、和平,吸收神性,對我來說,那是非常非常偉大,喜樂的東西。

我非常多謝所有這些,我希望你們可以保持這樣的進度。

願神祝福你們。

Translation from Marathi:

Now I thank the Sahaj yogis of India on behalf of everyone that they did all the work peacefully, not infighting with each other, not landing anyone in the soup, not causing anyone embarrassment, not showing any anger, and doing everything sensibly and setting a good example in front of them (foreigners). They think that you are very great men, devotees of God, wise, having a nice and balanced life, and are extremely moral. This means in short everyone thinks you are Shivaji Maharaj, and to such Shivaji Maharajas, you all, I bow to you.

Now I have to tell you that in us sometimes it so happens that words and deeds do not match, because we have so many ideals here that hypocrisy enters into a man. We put up a pretence of being very nice, which these people cannot see through, as they are straightforward people. They have nothing concealed in them, which goes to such an extent that we will say they are shameless, but in them whatever is there, it is visible to everyone. They don't keep any malice in their hearts, but in us this art is very advanced. So we show ourselves as very great to others, but inside we have many defects. So, we will be harmed in this case. When we talk to people, we say such things that people will feel God Almighty has himself descended on this earth, but if we look closely at their character or their life, then we feel that there is no bigger demon than them. And demons like these have gone abroad and swindled these people (foreigners). These people outwardly talk very sweetly, very nicely and act as if they are extremely innocent and loving, and after going abroad they have fleeced all their (foreigners’) money, made them hungry, destroyed their state, and they got respect and honour abroad. Then we all have a little bit of this quality that we can manage being outwardly very nice and be different inside.

These people (foreigners) cannot do this even if they want to. They even ask Me, "But he says he is so nice. So how can it be? I mean, if someone is a bad person among us then he will state clearly, ‘I am a bad man. I am cruel’.” So I said, “We don't do this. If we say this we will get a beating. So we do not tell. Instead, they say, ‘I am extremely good.’ Even if he is an extremely cruel demon he will say, ‘I am extremely nice and a great man,’ but what he is inside, he will not say. I mean, we do not feel the responsibility to admit what we are inside.”

But in Sahaja yogis, outside and inside there is no difference. We should be the same outside and inside. The man who becomes the same outside and inside, ander baaher ek hi Janu, who has no difference in his thoughts and deeds, is a true saint. Outside and inside. If I tell you not to drink and I Myself sit drinking, then what will you say? This is a simple example, but if I am an Indian then I will drink in secrecy and tell everyone not to drink, and I will drink in secrecy. This is the Indian style. And the English style is telling you that drinking alcohol means you are going towards God. I am drinking, so you also drink. This is the style of the English or foreigners’ style. But both the styles are wrong. In their style even if we say everything is exposed, still it is foolishness, and even if we conceal everything nicely, we are really not as nice as we seem. We should keep this in mind. If we are surrendered to God, God helps us. He blesses us with innocence by which we cannot put up fake pretences. Where is the wisdom in pretending to ourselves? There is no meaning in it. By the fear of society or for the sake of show, we show we are ideals and we are nice. This gives one the impression that in society evil does not spread much, but by that egoistic behaviour and hypocrisy we are never going to benefit. So why don't we benefit ourselves? We should think like this, that by doing goodness and good deeds they will benefit us.

Now people of old times used to say that saints always had trouble, and they always had grief. What happiness did they get from God? They faced so many crises, and the rest of the people lived in happiness. But in a way if we look at it, no one was happy. So, let’s look around. We see lots of people who seem happy, people who are rich, people in power, people who have huge empires, but if you look closely, no one is unhappier than them. They are in deep misery. If I tell you their grief, it is as big as mountains, and they are crushed under it. They are as good as mad. They don't understand what to do. They do an injustice and then they feel bad about it. It must be so! If someone hurts anyone, then it returns back to him. The torturing hand also suffers. So they are in great grief. If they are cruel to anyone, then that cruelty affects them also.

We went to see those people who think they are very rich and very prosperous to their home. The day before yesterday I was in Pune. There is a gentleman who is very rich. He invited me to his house. About two or three years back, his wife and his son were very big alcoholics, and his daughter-in-law was on the verge of having tuberculosis. They were facing such a big calamity, but her husband was a drunkard and they had lots of money. The woman could not give up alcohol, come what may. She was like big-time alcoholics, and they were so prosperous that you cannot even imagine. So he told Me, "Mataji, I will give you lots of money. Please cure my wife." I said, “I don't need any money. I will cure your wife.” And you will be surprised to know that the day before yesterday both the son and his mother came. They had quit drinking completely and were completely normal. The rich man said, "Mother, I do not want this money. Due only to this money all the grief and penury has come into my house. All this trouble has only come from money. This is the true penury in the sense that I have so much money with me but I have no support from my wife and my son, and my daughter-in-law was falling ill. So this is true penury that I had. So I do not want this money. You put this money anywhere. Put this to good use. I don't want this money."

Other rich people whom I saw, some were caught up with false gurus, some were caught somewhere else, and there were misery and illness in their homes. Someone started running after money. So he went to the races where he lost everything, blah, blah. He ditched his wife and children and he kept women, began drinking and all this happens. This means that if we look at someone and say, “See how successful he is,” tomorrow if he falls from grace he will be lying on the road for days and no one will look at him. People say to him, “When you were in power you behaved like this. So now we do not care for you.” His aura of power is also gone. I mean, now there is also no meaning in his power. In this way, whatever we say makes a person successful, but when a person gets it, he is not happy. Have you ever seen a drunkard being garlanded after his death? We never hear, “He was such a big drunkard. Let's build his statue,” or “This person was very cruel. He ill-treated everyone, but he was in power. Let's build his statue.” Have you seen this anywhere? There is no statue of Hitler anywhere, one who was very well-regarded at one time and did so much cruelty. There is no statue of him anywhere. This means that the person who lives a bad life will never get recognition ever. So, superficially we may feel that he became so big and successful for the time being, but if we look with foresight, that man never gets peace.

So, after this we must understand that true prosperity is in attaining your spirit. But now this Mahayoga that is started, at the time of this Mahayoga we are going to get true prosperity in every way, as this time all the seven chakras have come on Sahasrara. As all the seven chakras have joined on Sahasrara, due to their integration we get the Laxmi principle. Similarly, we get the principle of Bhramadev, meaning all kinds of creativity will come to you, and you will start writing poetry. Also, if we are afraid of something or we are facing some loss or someone is attacking us, then all that attack is negated, and if someone still attacks us then he is destroyed. Such a situation will come. You should try to attain this level.

After that, at the level of Vishuddhi is the place of Shri Krishna. There you will get complete Kshema (wellbeing). As Krishna has said, “I will give you Kshema. If you get your yoga, I will give you Kshema.” All kinds of Kshema means beginning with good physique and a glow on the face. The whole life of the person blooms like a lotus. He gets the witness state, peace and mastery like Shri Krishna. He can do with people as he pleases and put them on the right track. He gets a kind of authority and sovereignty.

After that, on coming to Agnya chakra he gets a reservoir of forgiveness. He is not hurt by anyone or anything. He forgives everyone. Nothing sticks to him. Whatever anyone says to him or if anyone hurts him, he forgives. And this forgiveness has so many powers, it’s as if forgiveness forms a big mace and goes and puts that man in his place who had hurt him. I mean, either that man is corrected or he is destroyed. I mean, you have so big a blessing of Agnya chakra. Also on Agnya chakra are Ekadasha rudra, meaning that those people who have ill-treated you or troubled you, their Ekadasha gets caught up and they are destroyed. This means on one side you are nurtured, and you get love, growth and protection, while on the other side those who try to hamper your growth are completely destroyed. This is the magic of Sahaja Yoga today. This means it is the work of the seven chakras.

Then, Sahasrara being My place, those who reach Sahasrara and establish themselves, once their Sahasrara opens up, are blessed with Mother's love in all ways, and whatever is sweet and fruitful in it, they get all the kinds of its tastes. Man feels truly blessed. He becomes aware that he is completely secure and he swims in the ocean of joy. His powers increase tremendously, and people give him recognition. A lot of people who have never spoken publicly become big and famous speakers. They develop oratory skills and they give realization to lots of people. In this way, the world is getting a new leadership which was predicted fourteen thousand years ago. So, this is the time to make true the fourteen-thousand-year-old prediction, and whatever has to be done is to be done only by your hands. You will be such big people that you have a place on My Sahasrara, you are sitting in My Sahasrara, and a lot of work will be done by your hands. And to do the work we need capabilities. We need to give up pretences, quit being hypocrites, stick to truth, be straightforward. We should ignore small things and look at the bigger picture. We should not get upset with each other, nor get angry or distressed with each other, and one must be humble and shine in one’s own glory. Even if only this is done, it is a lot. Everything is in your own hands, everything is near you, everything is given to you by God Almighty. So, it's not like something special has to happen. It is a very simple thing to happen, and it is already predicted that it will manifest. You only need to stand in this holy Ganges. Keeping your legs close to each other, nicely you need to stand your ground. If you manage this a little, everything can be done. In this way once Sahaja Yoga spreads, everyone is going to be blessed by it.

So I bless you that you get those benefits and you bloom in it. My infinite blessings to you.

May God bless you all.

May God bless you all.
