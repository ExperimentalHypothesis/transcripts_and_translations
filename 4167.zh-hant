聖誕崇拜

印度格納帕提普蕾1997年12月25日

Translated from Hindi:

Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ’s life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir. He went back just for last three years and people fixed Him to a cross. It was somewhat destined. To open Agnya chakra He had to offer this sacrifice. So in this way He set up Agnya chakra. Agnya chakra is very constricted small and not easily openable because a human being got freedom that made him egoistic. This ego constricted his Agnya chakra. And from that constricted Agnya chakra it was necessary to take out ego And to take out ego you have to control your [MAAN]. But you do not take out your ego from your [MAAN] As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your [MAAN] the [MAAN] will go on increasing and the ego will go on increasing [ AHAAM KAROTI SAHA AHAMKAR ] We do ! It means that if we try to minimise our ego the ego will shoot up because we will try to do so with the help of ego only. Those who think that to our ego will suppress will eat less food worldwide violence one standing on one foot and some on their head Every type of experiment people do to destroy their ego But it does not supress the ego. It shoots up. To fast, to do [JAP TAP] everything shoots up ego ! [Havana] also gives rise to ego ! Because Agni is right sided. Whatever karmakand we do, rituals we perform gives rise to our ego. For the past thousands of years human beings have been doing the same type of karmakand. Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing. This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand. There is no need to do any karmakand. And to go to the extremes is all the more bad. As I said that to take away your ego you, in Marathi is called [‘ JODE PATTI’] beat ‘it’ with shoes. So daily in the morning Sahajyogis move out in a line with shoes in their hands. O.k ! but if you have ego, then only Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand. All this karmakand penetrated into Sahajyoga too. So much so that from France a gentleman came from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there. It is for sick people. If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand The karmakand of cancer are written in that. I said it is human being’s nature to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it because of my karmakand, work will be done and in this karmakand not only you in foreign country also many people go on doing karmakand of various types. For example will go to church once a year. means today after that they don’t take even the name of God. after doing all the dirty jobs of world and go to Catholic [ DHARAM ] and make confession If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi. If you can understand that this wrong act What we have done is wrong and now onwards this act is not to be done. If you can understand this your brain will retain it Now Karmakandis have got all the more qualities. One thing is that they are misers number one. If you talk to them about ten rupees they start jumping into the sky. That is called in Marathi, ‘KODI CHUMBAK’ One thing is that in Marathi there are such words That your ego will dissolve easily. For example somebody talked high of himself, i did this, i did that tell him in a low voice ‘You are climbing a chickpea tree’. A chickpea tree doesn’t exist ! [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] So he cools down. I did this, i did that, i Till this ‘I’ ness doesn’t go till then our recognising Christ is wrong. But it is surprising that what is called Christian Nations where there is chritianity more than them egoistic I have not seen particularly English. American everybody is so much egoistic that can’t understand these desciples of Christ. Now what is the remedy of this ego? that should be thought It’s remedy was Jesus Christ and He has taught that now love everybody love your enemies too. It’s remedy He said was ‘Love’. and apart from ‘Love’ there is no remedy. But this ‘Love’ is the ‘Love’ of Param Chaitanya. He said clearly,’Seek yourself’. knock the door and the door will open ! It doesn’t mean that you go and knock the door. It means open the doors of your heart. A peson whose heart is small those who are misers that person can never be a Sahajyogi. And another thing which is very important if you get angry it means that you have too much ego. I have seen absolutely angry volatile people And they feel elated saying,’I am a very angry person’. Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga. Those who know to ‘Love’ and that too ‘Pure Love’ and that too such ‘Love’ where there is no expectation no desire those who completely know to love selflessly only they can be in Sahajyoga. Egoistic people do wrong acts. I am tired of them. They will start something on their own and they won’t even tell me. and by doing so Today thousands of questions have risen Today it is worth saying that in Delhi once they on the day of some puja hurriedly told me that we are getting land only this much. How much did we charge ? How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing ! And no Sahajyogi told me. Because if tomorrow somebody says, ‘Mataji has said so’ leave that person. If I have to say something, I will tell myself. After that we had so many meetings, I didn’t say anything. Now those who have given them money are holding their heads that they have been cheated ! How to get back that money ? Without asking Me all the work Absolutely without asking Me. The land is so bad that they have received a notice that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me and ask Me they made a society of their own and became mad that they are getting land It is such a bad land It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ? Now whatever has happened is foolishness ! and for that I am not responsible. But you ask for your money back. It is none of My resposibility. Jesus Christ had said that those people make houses live in houses they should watch birds he makes his own [GHARONDA] with how much love they make a small one for their ownself and when they make their home they feel a great joy in constructing that home He explained it in every way that you give up attatchment. This is my house. This is my land. They are my children. Even this much that it is my country. This attatchment should be given up. Then only you can be great. In the whole world you are brothers and sisters. It doesn’t mean that you give up devotion to your country. Not at all ! If you are not devoted to your country you can’t do anything. Within you there should be devotion to country. But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world. If there is no devotion to one’s country if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ? first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all. If you are working against your country you are not devoted to it. Jesus Christ had no need to go back. He had said also That there live such people Those who have the desire of only [MAL] are [MALECH] But Shalivahana told Him, ‘No ! No 1 you go’. ‘ And teach them [NIRMAL TATTWA] the principle of purity. He went to teach them [NIRMAL TATTWAM] and they put an end to His life. It is mad people’s country. He didn’t need to learn anything. But had to teach something. That is why He went there. and for the same reason His end was this way. But ‘Wiseness’ and ‘Forgiveness’ ‘Forgiveness’ is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra. If against anyone you have any ill feeling against anyone anger or if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone your Agnya cannot be up to the mark. Whatever you have to do you have to do with love. Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say so that his life becomes ‘NIRMAL’. It doesn’t mean that you spoil your children. To children you have to perfectly discipline If you cannot discipline children your children can never be good Sahajyogis. And for that you must be yourself disciplined. If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children. About Jesus Christ’s life very little was written. But He was so disciplined In this way tolerated and from His life He showed He didn’t need to be married He didn’t marry It doesn’t mean that He was against marriage. People have such wrong notions And that is why they have self made notions the women who are called ‘NUNS’ were married to Jesus Christ He was Sakhshat Ganesha ! How can anyone be married to Him ? Apart from that Men also no to marry such unnatural/ uncultural concepts were taught.............. With that everyone can be kept under control but one cannot become Christian. like such [KRITRIM BANDHAN] to cover oneself today Chritian religion is losing its importance. They forgot Jesus ! and created a religion out of their own and call it Chritian religion. The Christian religion of today Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus ! Because I was born in this religion I saw the ins and outs of this religion. The same is the case with Hindu religion. In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all. Because your various gurus, real gurus like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies are your many incarnations and your Sayambus are many. You don’t have one book. You have number of books. Only Jesus and Bible They can be fundamentalists. And they can be Yahudis also And all the three are related to each other. It is written in books. But a Hindu can never be communal. Because some have some guru and others a different guru. Some adore Mahalaxmi. Others Renuka Devi. Some to Krishna. So, every person every family individually adore incarnation, books. As such there is no book which can be called as Holy Bible. So to all the religions a Hindu should pay respect. The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus. Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible. They keep a Bible [IN THE ROOM] whether somebody reads or not. That Bible fell on the floor. There was one Hindu with us. He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table. They will never touch The Bible with their feet. The Christians will do so. A Hindu will never do so. To respect everybody is Hindu’s Dharma. But those who have come out of it are very very strange. Those who are our politicians such people have taken birth Asmushrooms come out in monsoon same way some people have come out. But they are not Hindus. They don’t know anything about their [DHARMA] religion. North Indians don’t know it at all. and those who are South Indians They know that bramhins have to be given money here and there have to do this and that [RITUALS]. In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand. They are so karmakandi. In Maharashtra I have worked very hard. Everything was waste. Because they are very ritualistic [KARMAKANDI]. They cannot give it up. Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak The Ganeshji that is there I have awakened that. Now what do I see that there one mile long long lines one mile long are standing on Tuesday. Gneshji too must have slept. The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra. Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot. And in North India also I have seen that some people are Karmakandi. And those who are Karmakandi they have lot of anger, are hot tempered. And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool. So the first thing is Stop ritualism. But respect everything. Stopping ritualism doesn’t mean to kick everything. This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ. Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open. Everbody’s respect and unnecessary ritualism in which wrong people are growing Now a day’s false gurus They exist because of ritualism [KARMAKAND]. They will say you give so much money, do this do that. Do Havana 108 times daily read these names, those names giving you mantras doing this that These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand. Completely against which is Jesus Christ. Which He knew that by doing Karmakand a human being becomes egoistic. and to crack this ego To Karmakand He had forbidden tottaly. had forbidden totally. The same way, in the name of God anyone earning money was objectionable to Him. On the contrary reverse process started. Earn money and consume. They don’t give up earning but [believe to] earn money and consume. It doesn’t solve any problem. Today in Sahajyoga work We should remember how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work. How much money did we give? Jesus Christ had twelve fish killers. Even they spread in the whole world by working hard. Today you are so many disciples of mine. And if you want you can give realisation to so many people. Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga. But the people should not be half baked. They should be deep. Unless they are deep, they cannot understand. And for that the greatest thing is that how much we love them. And how much love they give to others. Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga he should remember first of all that the teaching of Jesus Christ to love everybody Am i doing that ? I shower my anger over everyone. I keep everybody under control I express my anger with my eyes. This ego is very much not only against Sahajyoga but his destructor Whosoever is egoistic should lessen it and replace it with love Life will be a pleasure. Life will be beautiful ! If you don’t know how to love then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga. First you open the doors of your heart. With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread. The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga they have the Shakti [Power] of love less and the Shakti of anger more. It will never spread. With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish. The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand. Sorry I had to talk in Hindi language because most of the people here are Indians Some of them are Marathis and others are from North India. I was telling them about Christ. What was His power ? His power was of ‘Love’. And not of anger Because He is the one who has crossed the most difficult center of Agnya. Those people who have ego never realise they have ego With their ego they do all kinds of nonsensical things. Without asking Me they have done something in Delhi. Without asking me they have done something in Russia. And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga. that they don’t realise what they have done is the crime which is punishable by all Divine laws. If you want to do anything you must tell me beforehand. You must consult Me you must talk to Me Because I know what is happening. You don’t know if somebody wants to cheat you. Then how will you know if you were so sensitive you would find out You would have asked Me, ‘Mother what should we do ?’ At least ask Me. This is the main thing missing among Sahajyogis now that we have a kind of a very subtle ego. If you make somebody a leader it is very dangerous sometimes if the leader developes ego because of his wife. It is a very difficult thing. They can destroy Sahajyoga completely. Anything is possible. So before you do anything like that you have to consult [Me]. I am still living and you can ask You can write to Me, you can telephone too. Atleast I am there to tell you but then you have to develop your balance and your love.

抱歉我必須講印地語,因為這裡大多數人都是印度人,他們有些是馬拉地人(Marathis),還有一些人來自印度北部。

我要告訴他們關於基督的事情。基督的力量是什麼?祂的力量是愛而不是憤怒。因為是祂穿過了額輪這個最困難的中心。

那些自我取向的人從未意識到自己的自我。他們帶著自我做了各種荒謬的事情。沒詢問我他們就在德里做了些事,沒詢問我他們就在俄羅斯做了些事;這對霎哈嘉瑜伽而言,是如此具有破壞性,而他們不知道自己的所作所為是犯罪,是要受到所有的上天律法懲罰的。如果你想做什麼事,一定要事先告訴我,你一定要諮詢我,你必須和我談談,因為我知道正在發生著什麼。而你不知道,假如某人想欺騙你,你怎麼會知道呢?除非你很敏感,你才會查明。所以,你要問問我,至少需要問問我:“母親我們該怎麼做?”,現在在霎哈嘉瑜伽士中,這是最主要的缺失——我們有種非常精微的自我。如果你讓某人當領袖,有時會很危險,如果領袖因為妻子的緣故而發展出自我,這是一件非常麻煩的事情,他們會完全毀了霎哈嘉瑜伽——任何事都是有可能發生的。

所以在做任何類似的事之前,你要諮詢我,我還活著,你可以問我,你可以寫信給我,你可以打電話給我。至少我會告訴你。然後你要發展出你的平衡和你的愛。這只有透過Paramachaitanya,藉由這個無所不在的上天浩愛的力量,你才發展出明辨力,你發展出那些特別的力量。有人僅是打電話給我,我馬上就能知道這個人有什麼問題。我不是說你會變成像我一樣,但至少你有生命能量去檢驗。也檢驗一下你自己的生命能量,你進展如何?放一張紙在你手上,你會看到它在我的照片前開始抖動。而自我一旦發展,帶著這個自我你無法進步。

你為什麼來霎哈嘉瑜伽?你來這不是為了成為領袖或國王那類的人,你來這裡是為了成為一名偉大的導師——正如你們向我請求的那樣——Gurupada dijiye。為此,在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,你必須要有完全的謙卑、自然的謙卑、自然的平衡——這就是基督教導我們的。

那個時代,我不認為人們有很多的自我,自我是現代的產物。人們從任何事中獲得自我。例如,我曾遇到過一位女士,我發現她的自我很糟。我說她怎麼回事?接著我問我的女兒們,她是做什麼的?她們說,媽媽,她知道怎樣製作玩偶。因此她有自我。有什麼比成為一個優秀的霎哈嘉瑜伽士更偉大呢?你或許是個國王,你或許是個什麼人物。現在你看看那些總理們,他們所有人都進了監獄。他們怎麼能與你們相比?他們沒有平衡,他們沒有知覺。

是什麼讓你們成為了與眾不同的個體 —— 更高的人類?是因為你們沒有自我!

現在人們努力地去除他們的自我,有兩種類型。他們會持續鞋打他們自己,並且做各種儀式主義的事情去除他們的自我。可是所有這些事情都是用思維去做,這只會帶給他們自我。他們變成苦行者,他們是最大的自我主義者。我必須要說,希特勒是最大的苦行者,借由他的苦行主義他成為希特勒。如果你想變成希特勒你就變成苦行者。在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,你根本不被允許做所有苦行。你必須富有愛心、親切、善良和自律。我必須強調的是,某些時候當你充滿愛心時,由於你沒有通曉霎哈嘉瑜伽的紀律,你就會越界。愛並不是說你要變成羅密歐和茱麗葉那樣,不是這個意思。你必須通過紀律達到平衡。如果你沒有紀律你永遠也不會成為一個好的霎哈嘉瑜伽士。從基督的一生中,我們必須學會這些 ——除非我們擁有這種特質,否則我們不可能成為一個好的霎哈嘉瑜伽士。

首先是儀式主義的本性,第二是憤怒,第三是吝嗇。比如你去英國,那裡乘計程車要付英磅。這就是吝嗇的實例,整天想著我們在哪裡可以省錢,“母親,您可以給優惠嗎?”,“如果您收半價許多人會來”!類似的事情。我在這裡不是做什麼生意,我自己沒有用你們的錢,我把所有得到的錢用於建造供你們用的房子。當然,這些錢有我的也有你們的。我成就了很多事情,所有這些我已經做到——整個VASHI,所有的靜室,在德里有兩個靜室,以及整個學校,還有在浦內(Pune)和其他地方的土地。

現在在浦內(Pune),他們希望我付土地費,為所有事情付費。浦內人是馬哈拉斯特拉邦人(Maharastrians),這裡的人眾所周知非常吝嗇,喜歡耍陰謀(譯注,英文稿為conjurish, 疑為conjuresed)。甚至他們自己的靜室,他們也希望我來付費,為所有的一切付費,然後他們再舒服地去唱拜讚歌,你看,他們都是所謂的好音樂家,但他們也是非常非常小氣的人。吝嗇的人永遠不會愛,他們只熱愛錢。利己主義的人永遠不會愛,他們只愛那控制他人的力量。

他們認為自己是為霎哈嘉瑜伽這樣做,但並非如此。除非你改善自己和去除你的自我,否則為霎哈嘉瑜伽工作是沒用的。看看基督,祂出生在一個非常簡陋的住所。雖然祂就是國王,可祂和窮人住在一起,並努力解救他們。祂救了麻風病人,祂救了很多人,有21個人被祂治好了。

現在在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我不知道具體多少,數以千計的人已被治癒。但重要的是,如果你正在醫治,要知道不是你在醫治——是上天大能在醫治,你沒做任何事,這點必須要清楚明瞭。我也有同感,我什麼也沒做,我是NISHKRIYA,什麼也沒做 —— 但我不惰怠。你應該是活躍的,而你的所作所為應該來自上天大能的浩愛。首先,你要為愛延展雙手,延展你的心,延展你的錢、房子和一切,為了愛做這些。

現在,如果你的妻子不允許其他人進家,把她扔出房子,我不在意。教她如何親切和慷慨 ——反過來對丈夫也一樣。這很重要,你必須慷慨,必須親切,必須對他人充滿愛和甜美。

基督只發過一次脾氣,是當祂看到人們在廟宇裡賣東西時——祂有權利那樣做。我們這兒也發生過同樣的事情。如果你不去他們那裡買東西,他們就會消失。但你們就是要去他們那裡買東西,因為你們有購物的習慣。人們去哪都一定要購物,他們必須購物這是種習慣。他們不會去看綠色植物,欣賞大自然的美,什麼也不看。

你們知道,以前我隨同我的丈夫到訪很多國家時,我一定會去看看那些諸如博物館之類的美麗地方。我從不會去購物。但是當我有這麼多孩子時,我就得購物了,我會去買些東西。但不會去每個地方都是為了購物。當你們為了自己的靈性成長來到這裡,會有什麼好買的呢?在麥加(Mecca)有什麼商店嗎?這是比神聖更神聖的地方。為何你們要去那些商店呢,我不能明白。我告訴他們不要開店鋪,但是你們這些人支持、鼓動他們從我們這賺錢。沒有什麼必要在那裡買。現在你們是為了神聖的時刻而來,你們來到這裡是為了你們的崇拜。

在我們的摩訶拉希什米廟宇,有人賣女士紮頭髮用的花環及飾物,但是他們說是為女神準備的,然後真的就會有人甚至所有來的人,很愚蠢地在那裡買。然後他們把花環獻給廟宇裡的婆羅門,婆羅門再以更低的價格賣出去。只因前往那裡的人們的愚昧,這些花環我不知道被買賣、買賣了多少次。如果他們真要帶些什麼來,他們應當從外面買來,而不是在那個你來到的地方。當你去德里,你可以在那裡買,或者你來孟買,你可以在那裡買。但不是在這個地方買,我們不能把這個地方變成孟買或德里,否則我們為什麼要來這裡呢?這就是為什麼基督打那些在教堂附近賣東西的人的原因(注:此處took a hunter沒有翻譯,錄音聽了也是這幾個詞,但無法找到合適的意思)。我看到如今他們沒這麼做了,在教堂附近他們沒有這麼做了,他們在外面這麼做。但是他們賣別的東西。像天主教教堂會賣一種叫Benedictine的酒,你們可以想像到嗎?

還有一個故事。基督去參加一個婚禮,他們沒有wine;如今在希伯來語(Hebrew)中,wine是葡萄汁的意思,不意味著是發酵過的。因此祂把水轉化成了那種葡萄汁。你不可能把水瞬間轉化成酒,酒必須得腐爛,得有氣味,氣味越濃越好。但是他們認為基督說你必須喝酒,你看。祂從來沒有那樣說,祂僅僅把水轉化成wine,wine的意思是葡萄汁。

有一次在義大利我去做電視節目,有一位好男士。他說:“母親,您先給我自覺吧。”於是我說,“拿些水來。”我把手放進去。“現在你喝下它。”他說味道像葡萄汁(wine)。我說,“這就是基督所做的。”就這樣他得到了他的自覺。

你不可能瞬間釀制出酒。然而如果有人死了,他們會喝酒,如果有人出生了,他們也會喝酒。不惜任何代價,不喝酒他們就不正常。但得到自覺的人會突然改變,他們不想喝酒,他們停止了喝酒,他們的注意力變好,整個事情都改變了。這就是轉化所成就的,也是基督所談過的,默罕默德所談過的,每個人都談到過這個人們會得到轉化的特殊時刻。

但即使在轉化後,你還是不想成為你必須要成為的樣子,你們是為此而來到這裡的,這樣的話你將會被淘汰。這個大轉化正在發生,在這個轉化中你也在升進。一個大的進化正在進行,那些無法妥善進化的人會被淘汰。正如傳說那樣這是最後的審判,你會被審判,你會被淘汰,因為你的重量你會掉下去,你無法追隨那些升進得較高的人。

所以對你而言要理解基督,就是你要具備祂的所有特質。如果你還是脾氣暴躁,好吧,去鞋打你自己,但若你不是這樣就不必做鞋打。你必須知道自己是怎樣的。首先,你要內省然後去解決,但形式主義在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡永遠不被允許。我喜歡我所有的孩子都富有愛心和集體意識,不會平白無故地譴責任何人,如果你必須公開指責你應該告訴我,我知道是怎麼回事。沒問過我你不可以評價任何人,也不可以說我已經評價過某人,你用什麼評價呢?你的標準是什麼?你自己還被束縛在自我的羅網中。沒告訴我之前你不能譴責任何人。你必須告訴我,不用擔心會打擾我或其他什麼,你本該問我。我瞭解每個人,也許我沒見過那個人,但是我能感知到生命能量。

你們可以寫信給我。很多人只是打電話,那不是辦法,你們必須寫信給我,因為我會讀每一封信。但是你們不要寫任何荒謬的信來浪費我的時間 —— 比如我爸爸、我媽媽或這個人病了、死了,她的亡靈在遊走等等。各種可笑的信件都寄給我,對這些人我能做什麼呢?那是不重要的。又或者是,我沒錢,我需要錢,我在金錢上指望您,請您寄錢給我。你可以對著我的照片請求。如果你是一個好的霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你也不必擔心錢。或者我沒孩子,母親,該怎麼辦?我想有個孩子。問問那些有孩子的人,看他們說些什麼?

很多人來到霎哈嘉瑜伽後有了孩子,但你必須是配得到的。很多奇跡已發生,很多人被治癒,這毫無疑問。但那並不表示你已經做到了,不要掉進自我的陷阱,那是最危險的。如果你破壞霎哈嘉瑜伽,那你就是在毀滅自己。

所以今天,你們必須在心裡承諾,把手放在你們的心臟上說,“母親,我們會去愛,我們會傳播您上天的愛並讓愛環繞整個世界,給所有人自覺。我們不會咆哮,不會發怒,我們不會做各種儀式,而只是交托,交托我們的自我給您。”

交托它,交托你的自我,所有的問題都能被解決。因為只要有自我,這上天的力量就無法接管,你做任何事時沒有連接,連接會消失。基督會消失,祂不再在那裡。要建立祂首要的是你必須展示你是如何去愛的,那並不意味著你只愛你的妻子、你的孩子和你的房子。

你必須愛每一個人。努力讓每個人高興。這就是為何我喜歡音樂,因為通過音樂能散播生命能量,這是非常好的媒介來散播生命能量,愛的能量。但那些音樂家們必須是有愛心的人,不會脾氣暴躁,不炫耀,不過分為自己著想。如果我們明白上天的力量是如此強大,所有這些都會成就得非常好。這就是愛,這就是真理,這是毫無疑問的。如果你脫離祂,你會被任何東西逮住,你可能會被毀掉。這是一種你自己內在擁有的,非常非常強有力的、有效的、絕對決定性的力量。感謝基督,祂被釘死在十字架上,為我們犧牲了祂的身體,我們的額輪因此被打開 —— 否則我不可能完成這霎哈嘉瑜伽。但是在這個區域(母親指著前額)我們有佛陀、基督、大雄(Mahavira),祂們都得做tapasya、tapaha(苦行),祂們已經做過了,如今你們不需要做,祂們已經為你們做了。

昨天我見到了音樂家們,在兩三個月的時間裡他們學會了這麼多,而之前我認識的所有學印度音樂的音樂家,他們不得不一起挨餓數月,在一起練習,必須一起服從于他們的導師數年。現在那一切都結束了,是因為這個上天無所不在的力量,而你的力量與上天合而為一了。這個上天的力量能完全地轉化你,並且達到這樣一種程度:任何你想做的事情,你能在兩三個月內做到。

在浦內(Pune),有一次,一些外國人在唱歌——我們就是這麼稱呼他們以示尊重。在印度,外國人的稱呼意味著尊重他們,跟其他國家不同。他們正在歌唱,到場的有一些非常傑出的音樂家,他們告訴我,“母親,我們真得向他們鞠躬致敬,因為這些人根本不懂得印度音樂的一個字,他們怎麼能學得那麼好?”馬拉地語的發音非常難,他們卻那麼擅長,真讓人吃驚。現在這些都在你面前發生,在你面前發生。

很不錯你們有很多氣球來慶祝基督的生日,而在你們腦袋裡的所有這些自我的氣球,都應該爆掉,應該結束了。

如果你們能學印地語我會很高興 —— 我知道我的英語可能不太好 —— 最好是能學印地語,如果可能的話。因為在印度已經有14種語言,在其他國家也有很多種語言。每個國家都有一套不同類型的英語語言。如果你去美國,至少有兩三天我聽不懂他們的英語,因為他們用他們的方式講話,他們的嘴唇在一邊,然後再到另一邊。法國的英語呢,就是另外一個樣子。所以最好是學印地語,學好的印地語,不是梵語化的印地語,比如他們說“Roz-marrah”——日常的印地語,假如你們都能明白我所說的,我會感覺更好,這不會很難,因為你們都是霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你能很快學會印地語。

我不是說學梵文,但是印地語是很簡單的。它不是我的母語,我從未學過印地語,從來沒有,但是你看它是很容易學的語言。當我的父親告訴我,永遠不要教英國人學印地語,我問為何有這樣的建議?他說,「有個英國人追著我要學印地語,他說我得告訴我的僕人去開門或關門。」所以,開門呢,他說你要說「there was a cold day(天氣很冷),」就是Warwaza khol dey;而關門呢,你要說「there was a banker(有一位銀行家),」就是Warwaza band kar。但是現在不同了。他們能很快學懂印地語,非常快,我知道。如果他們能那麼容易的學這種可怕的很難學的印度古典音樂,那麼結果會怎樣呢?他們可以很快學會印地語讓我更高興。不是因為印地語是我的母語,不是的,馬拉地語是我的母語。但是馬拉地語很難,我想你們學不會,它是很精確的。

我想馬拉地語是讓你放下自我最好的語言之一。這就是為何馬哈拉斯特拉邦人通常不會自我取向的原因,因為在說這種語言的過程中有一種美感。舉例說,有人在吹噓:我做過這個,我做過那個。在馬拉地語中,他們會說,不要去爬灌木叢,或者你們稱為CHANNA一種那麼巨大的樹, 然後那個人就不說話了。像這樣有很多成語可以當著那個人的面說讓他放下自我。所以馬拉地語有很多優勢,不過我不會要求你們學習馬拉地語,那並不容易學,但是你要學印地語,它很容易,非常容易。

但是有一件事你必須要知道,印地語裡有adab的方式。adab的意思是謙虛、尊重 —— 尊重,但是比尊重更多,它是一種說話的風格。不是烏爾都語(Urdu),而是印地語的日常交談,帶有尊重的一種與他人說話的方式。這方式會給你一種更靈活的工具來表達你的愛。因為在印地語中我們從不會說我恨你;你不可以這麼說。恨某人是有罪的,所以他們從不說我恨你。「貞潔」在馬拉地語中有更多的意思,但是因為它有較多的意思,所以有點難學。比如我告訴你們的那種可以當場糾正你的成語。

所有的這些只是請求你,如果你能學會這種非常難學的音樂,你可以隨時學這種非常非常簡單的、非常非常容易說的印地語。

我希望你們能瞭解關於基督的許多事,但時間太短我沒法都告訴你們,祂有祂自己的優先任務。儘管聖經中沒有完全地描述祂,我得說,不管在聖經中寫了什麼,或許他們刪減掉了。他們實踐基督教的方式也令人震驚。你必須用心學習基督教義,別無他法,他們應該通過你們母親的心來用心學習。

願上帝祝福你們所有人!
