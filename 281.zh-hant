母親的忠告 英國布賴頓1979年11 月15 日

布賴頓(Brighton;譯者按..Brighton有照亮的意思 ),這個名字是那麽漂亮。它要照亮整個國家。我到過這裏兩次,我常常感到若有機會的話,我們真的要在這裏大規模地發展霎哈嘉瑜伽。有一天,這裏將會變成一處朝聖的地方。在布賴頓有很混合的能量,這裏有海;而且,母親大地在這裏有特別的意義。當某些神性力量開始散發,邪惡便會到來,偽裝起來,積累力量,開始攻擊神性,這就是為甚麽我感到布賴頓有混合的能量。整體上,這是一個好地方,霎哈嘉瑜伽可以在此昌盛。

他們一定告訴了你有關霎哈嘉瑜伽。’Saha’(霎哈) 的意思是「同在」,‘Ja’(嘉)則是「與生俱來」。這是一種瑜伽,你追尋與神的聯合是與生俱來的。在你內裏,每個人都曾說:「在內裏追尋他。」耶穌基督也曾這樣說。意思是你必須追尋,這是你的自由。這自由是不可以被挑戰的,你必須去請求。例如,若神能在人類現在的知覺狀態,在你們不須進入這齣戲劇下,就能把你們轉化至更高的知覺狀態,祂一定在很久以前已經做了。但祂不能,所以你必須在自由意願下追尋神性。

你肯定是正在追尋,或許你不知道你在追尋什麽。但有一點是肯定的,你對事物現在的狀態並不滿足,你想追尋某些超越表面的東西。毫無疑問,有某些東西是超越表面,所有先知、所有經典、所有降世神祇都曾講述過,也曾應許過——還有——有一天你會受審判。最先要審判的是你自己。你自己決定你是在追尋神性或其他瑣碎的事情。若你是在追尋實相或真理,那麽,只有你會被挑選,只有你才會是天國的子民。

現在,讓我們看看誰是這個神以及看我在說些什麽。開始時,只有寧靜,完全的寧靜。在這寧靜之中,當它被喚醒,寧靜也被喚醒。這寧靜被稱為「Para Brahma」,很抱歉,我要用梵文,這並不代表這是某些印度式的東西,這種想法你必須擺脫。在印度,人們靜坐比較多。他們不用像我們今天那樣,在進入這會堂時,與大自然對抗。這裏的氣氛是非常友善和温暖。人們可以在樹下靜坐,他們不用對抗大自然太多,所以能長時間的入靜。通過入靜,他們發現很多東西,為此他們需要運用梵文。所以,這Para Brahma,或你可以說,這絶對的寧靜被喚醒。它自動被喚醒,自然得像我們睡覺,然後醒來。跟著這寧靜變成我們所稱為的至高濕婆神(Sadashiva)。當它被喚醒或當至高濕婆神開始有感覺,它開始要求,它期望去創造。正如我們所說,早晨的陽光穿過黎明。同樣地,當這欲望開始顯現,欲望變成「他」的力量,得到分隔。現在,無論我說什麽,對你來說,也只是一個故事,你不須相信,但我會漸漸的讓你相信,一步一步,你會相信這理論。對你這只是假設,所以,當這欲望變成了一個力量,這力量被稱為Shakti或摩訶力量(Mahashakti)或太初之母(Adishakti),意思即原初的力量(Primordial power)。這原初的力量假定自己的個性和實體。若它想作出行動,必須這樣。若你心中只有願力,那並不好,我們必須把它轉化成某些形相,否則,那欲望只會上上落落。所以,這願力轉化成有形相,我們可以說,進入了實體,那實體在聖經中稱為聖靈,在梵文中稱為太初之母。接著,這願力從自己中再創造出兩個力量,一是作事的,另一是改善自己的創造。所以,這三個力量開始起作用,就是這樣,這三個力量被創造了。現在,你們也知道,沒有太多人講述聖經中所說的聖靈。很多經典有提及天父但並沒有提及聖靈。特別是耶穌的母親是聖靈的降世,他不想危害她的生命,他甚至沒有說她是聖靈的降世,因為若他們把她釘上十字架,他將會與他的毀滅力量一起顯現。但那齣戲劇必須上演,她必須保持沉默。現在,這聖靈對我們是很重要的,因為天父只是旁觀者,祂正在靜觀那齣戲劇,那齣聖靈所扮演的遊戲。祂要去享受她所創造的。祂是那齣遊戲的唯一見證者,她想以創造來取悅祂,因為創造是祂的願望,所以,她用這些力量來創造,我們已經得到的,被稱為最先­——願力(Mahakali),第二是行動(Mahasaraswati),第三是支持或你們稱為——進化(Mahalakshmi)。這些力量創造了我們——人類。現在,我們已到達可以談論它的階段。在耶穌基督的時代,人們不能談論聖靈。請你們告訴我,對那些漁民,我該怎樣做,你怎能告訴他們這些?只是一些準備的工作,但你們知道,他們卻做得一塌糊塗。人們不能明白,那些稱自己為宗教的,是那麽的混亂。他們怎能這樣狂熱?狂熱主義與宗教是刀刃的兩頭,他們不可能是同一樣東西。你可以看看現在的伊朗,在每一處,也看到人們是如何狂熱,他們是那樣沒有宗教信仰。因為宗教是愛,神是愛。信奉宗教的人,沒有一個能以「愛」應該被表達的方式來表達愛,沒有一個承擔起追尋神的工作。他們在做其他的工作,如博愛的工作,收集資金或安排大的買賣等等。這不是追尋神的人所做的工作。在這情況下,當我們面對組織宗教或破壞宗教的人和虛假的人,我們真的感到很灰心,我們感到目瞪口呆,不知道該怎樣做,因為我們天生是尋道者。我們在尋道的過程中,可能犯錯,但我們絶對是尋道者。若你並非尋道者,你會對參加某處的晚宴或舞會感到高興。但不是這樣,有某些超越表面、應許過的、你感覺到的東西,你感到它的存在但你仍未到達它的源頭,這就是為什麽你仍在追尋。

現在,我們內裏有三個力量。在左邊的是你的愛,你的願望力量,因此我們期求,我們表達自己的情緒。當這願力不再在我們內裏,當我們感覺這願力在我們內裏消失,我們也同樣的消失;在中央的是靈,它是父神在我們身上的反映或神的見證,它是在我們心裏;在右邊的是行動的力量。

這三個力量被創造得像在我們的注意力和「他」之間的一塊屏障。這塊屏障存在於我們的幻海,肝臟支撐著它。這三塊屏障令我們遠離「靈」。靈,我們看不見,感覺不到,不能把它彰顯。我們知道有人知道它。在薄伽梵歌(Gita),它被稱為「KshetrAgnya」,是那方面知識的認識者。所以我們知道,有一位認識者知道有關你的所有,他把你曾經做過的,你的追尋,你犯的過錯,你的紊亂,所有你曾經做過的事情,全都紀錄下來。而紀錄下的都放置在下面的三角骨中,稱為靈量。這是我們願望的剩餘力量,意思是當創造整個宇宙的時候,這願望的能量,那太初之母,在創造了整體後,仍然保持完整,因為她是完全的。那是非常容易明白。我們可以說,假設光和電影,光反射在整部電影裡但電影仍然保持完整。同樣,當她投射了自己,仍然殘存的,是那剩餘的力量,是那靈量。這代表你是靈量的完全投射。那力量,那願望的力量以二個力量顯現——在右邊的力量——稱為行動的力量,和在中央的力量。你已經進化至某一點,其餘的是幻海,它是負責你從亞米巴蟲進化至現在這個階段的力量。

我們應該提出一個問題:「我們為什麽要從亞米巴蟲變成人類?假若我有些螺絲,螺母等等,我把它們集合在一起。跟著,任何人可以問我,「你為什麽要這樣做?」我會說:「我要做一個擴音器。」但即使擴音器已經有一條線,它也需要接駁總機。除非它接駁至總機,它是不能操作。這就是我們已經得到了——那三個力量和那剩餘的力量,剩餘的力量是願望的力量,就坐在這裏,期望你的重生。她是你的母親,當她期望,當她看到權柄,看到某人擁有力量把她提昇,愛她如她愛我們,她才會開始行動,只有這樣她才會提昇。並不是玩什麽把戲,不是站在你的頭上,不是做什麽運動,不是毆打人,不是做各種這樣的事情。他們已經想到怎樣把她提昇,自自然然的,很霎哈嘉的,很自然地,提昇她。我的意思是就像有人來到你面前說:「你可否保証我的靈量可以得到喚醒?」我會說:「不,先生,我很抱歉,或許可以,或許不可以。」若你不爭辯,不爭辯太多,她是可以昇起。為什麽?若爭辯有什麽事情會發生?

我一定要告訴你,爭辯會有什麽發生。我並不是說你不應爭辯。你一定要,因為我知道你有一個問題,你太懂識別爭辯。沒有關係。當你爭辯時,你利用了你右邊的力量。通過思維,什麽會發生,你製造了那黄色的東西,那黄色的東西一般被稱為「自我先生」。當你思考時,這自我像這樣升起,壓向另一邊的超我,超我是從你的制約而來。所以這自我,若像這樣坐著它,我們怎能提昇靈量,因為那裏沒有位置,沒有多餘的空間,它是需要像這樣的平衡。所以爭辯,令我不能提昇靈量。所以為什麽我說:「讓我看看它,不要爭辯,只在乎現在。」但人們不喜歡這樣。你看,他們感到受挑戰,所以,我說,「照做吧。」什麽事在你爭辯時發生,思維不繼的壓迫你,所以當你爭辯,當你閱讀時,你不能提昇靈量。

你不可以付錢購買它,絶對不能用錢購買它。神並沒有店舖,祂不懂購物。你亦不能組織祂,我們不能組織神,祂組織我們。所以任何有組織的活動都不能成事。

那是絶對像種子發芽一樣,你只是把種子放入泥土及放點水。正如我所說,我放下愛心的水份,我給予你一點愛心的水,那麽它自會發芽生長。你有一顆種子,在你內裏的一顆苖芽,所有條件已經完備,它必須發生。生氣並不能成就事情,用任何你懂做的方法都不能成就事情。你必須不費力氣。你不用任何力氣就令種子發芽,你甚至不能把一朵花轉化成果實。實際上,我們所做的並不多。我們所做的,只是把死物變成另一種形態的死物,再從這形態轉變成另一種死物,就是這樣,我們沒有做任何有生命的事情。這是活生生的生命過程,所有的生命過程都是自自然然下完成。

所以,自自然然地它昇起。當它觸及你的頂輪,你開始感覺雙手有涼風。在印度的經典中,以saleelam-saleelam(意即涼呀涼呀)來形容這種狀態,這清涼的風像波浪般來臨,在聖經裏,我們也讀到涼風,整個力量是願望的力量,它以清涼的涼風彰顯成太初之母的三個力量,它是完全遍及的。當靈量上昇,它穿越那些輪穴,觸及它們。那些能量中心是精微的中心,位於我們的神經叢之下,在我們已知的醫學上,那是我們內裏的神經叢,跟著,我們得到自覺。

我不能為此給你一個演講或把你洗腦,要你變成有集體意識,這個實踐體現(actualization),是我們必須追尋。那是必須在你內裏發生,所以你才變成現在的模樣。這並不是向任何人標籤自己為霎哈嘉瑜伽士,不能這樣。霎哈嘉瑜伽士必須得到真正的洗禮。他的腦囟必須變得柔軟,靈量必須穿越它,只有這樣他才是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。

你們不可以有會員制度,不可以有這樣的東西。那是很自然的發生,若沒有在你內裏發生,那麽你仍不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。直到它發生,你仍在追尋。在像孩子一樣的人身上,只一秒之間,就發生了。但在曾經傷害自己的人身上,它可以很長時間才發生。實際上,在這個國家(英國),我見過很漂亮的人在這裏出生——誠懇的、誠實的和謙卑的人。遠古偉大的尋道者被祝福,在這裏出生,也在美國出生。但他們變得沒有耐性,因為沒有耐性,他們嘗試毀滅自己,這樣你們會傷害那些會受心理影響(psychosomatic)的能量中心。這些能量中心,將會短暫有問題,你必須有這些問題,你是為此而生,這是進化過程必然發生的,你必須認識自己,必須得到它。

尋道的路徑並不苛刻,只要請求就可以了。「謙卑的人有福了」這句話已經說過。謙卑而非傲慢。若你坐在我的頭上說:「給我自覺。」那麽我會說:「我並非那位施予者,但你卻是那位接受者。」就像流動中的恆河,若你把石頭拋入河裏,你不能從河中拿到水。你要找一個水罐,一個空的水罐,把它放入水中,水自會裝滿罐。是你的請求得到履行,你需要找出怎樣實行,若沒有這實行,你不能感到快樂。

在倫敦,當然有霎哈嘉瑜伽士,我們的進度像蟻一樣,原因是很實際的。你看到其他組織在傳播,在那裏,你付錢成為偉大的部長,這樣的事情在那裏發生,你戴上一個小盒,變成了偉大的假導師的偉大門徒,這樣的事情在發生。這樣做是非常容易,是不是呢?但要成為霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你必須面對自己,觀察自己。當美麗在你身上展現,你可以看到這是真理,你必須接受和給予。

不要感到有壓力,因為這是我的工作。你可以說我是付錢而做的。給予你自覺是我的工作,我必須要做的工作。你的工作是接受它,因為這就是你在這裏的原因。不是責任的問題,是愛,只是愛。我必須愛你,你必須接受我的愛。愛只是流通,只是散發。

我只是告訴你怎樣去接受愛。但人類的愛,你看看,是那樣具侵略性。我們不能明白,若有人說:「我愛你。」我們會逃跑。「你愛我,那麽我最好還是逃走。」因為愛代表佔有。人類的愛代表支配,具侵略性。但這愛只為愛,它令你平靜,令你提昇至一個新的面向,令你通過你的指頭,感到完全的啓迪,你的雙手可以告訴你,自己那一個能量中心有阻塞,別人那一個能量有阻塞。

霎哈嘉瑜伽士擁有很多祝福,我正要在我的講話裏告訴你們,或許其他霎哈嘉瑜伽士也可以告訴你們。

我不知道你的問題。若你有任何問題和提問,我樂意與你談談,但不要太長。因為霎哈嘉瑜伽士為此很担心。首先,他們向我提出很多問題,他們愧於回想那些問題。其二,他們感到很刺激,為甚麽你們不首先獲得自覺?為什麽你們不停的提問?你們最好得到已經在你們手中的東西。第其三,他們發現有時提出的問題,對自己和對別人都是沒有價值。

所以,有一點你要記著,這裏沒有任何東西在兜售。你不需要付錢購買它。那是某些正在流動的,某些沒有人知道它存在於這個世界的東西。只是流動,某些漂亮的。若你在某處看到美麗的景色,你只要觀看它。你就是要以這樣的態度來到這裏,只張開你的眼睛。張開你的眼睛­__­­­­­­­­_______那是被稱為Unmesh,即對那美麗張開你的雙眼,那是你自己。為此你必須準備妥當,毫無懷疑,因為沒有必要懷疑。但若你仍然有懷疑,我樂意解答你。無論如何,有時我們會提出一些好問題,我曾經見過有些人提出一些很好的問題,令我知道問題出在何處,這類問題也非常歡迎提出。但不要坐下來就抱著懷疑的態度,此其一。霎哈嘉瑜伽是一個大課題,那是非常困難去整體的解釋。藉著它,你獲得身體上、精神上、情緒上和靈性上的整合,因為所有能量中心都起作用,開啓你生命的四個向度,開啓了整體,所以你感到在集體意識裏的益處。那是一句頗複雜的句子,我已經說得很簡短,但若你仍有任何問題,不用害怕,可以問我,我是你的母親。

31:31

Are you all right? Good, you're feeling. They are born realized too. You'll feel, find out that in final mentally they are born realized. When I'll tell you, they'll take over till they knew all the fruit.

Some questions? Something? Better ask Me now because while realization, it should not be brought from somewhere, you know. Some of you stop thinking, if you notice. One really.  When the Kundalini rises above this center, you stop thinking.

(Question of a seeker about the image we have of the yogi living in isolation.)

Shri Mataji: Little loudly.

Seeker: One has heard, I was informed the venture of a yogi, as a half-a-yogi being I learn, and telling just himself is falling into this non-existence door specular and partnering that in isolation and continue to live in isolation and this is a protection to...

Shri Mataji: Who had?

Seeker: One has, one counselled so

Shri Mataji: Correct, correct, I agree.

Seeker: But this isolation is so, maybe he is now too captive.

Shri Mataji: But then how would you come to Brighton? You see from God's point of view. These yogis they live in the hills. They do even now. I have told them, they know Me very well, "Why don't you come down?" They don't want to. They are running away from you. Why? They know you will never understand them. They do not want to be crucified. Those who dared to come down were crucified and were killed. They are not there out of their own choice. They are there because they are running away from the madding crowd. You have to have a big heart to come down on this earth to face people who are blind.

This concept that you have is very good but of no use. They cannot come to Brighton. They won't even come down from their hills. I know so many of them in India – and they know all about it – they wouldn't do. They said, "No, we do not want to chop off our heads. Actually, some of them have broken their legs, some of them absolutely in a paralytic condition. They are all caught up. Some of them are on bed and they don't know what to do with themselves. I had to go and cure them.

It is true but to have such a concept itself is – we are having a concept about God again and that it should fit into that concept. Now they are not going to drop from heaven like that, are they? And are they going to talk to you? First time I have learnt English in this lifetime. How do they know English? They will just sit there with big stones in their hands. Anybody comes there they will be hitting. They don't want to see anybody's faces.

So, this is the idea of a yogi is and you cannot conceive of an idea of a yogi who lives in this world. Now Sahaja Yogis have to live in this world and not to run away to these far-fetched places hidden from everyone. We have to enlighten the whole world, not one - few persons individualistic, sitting down there and doing nothing. They are absolutely useless for our purpose. I tell them. They say, "After twelve years we will come." Now, what am I going to do? Am I going to pickle them down there? They are in the pickle state, doing nothing at all. I mean, are there so many like that and they have tremendous respect for Me and I know they always - sort of they have told all the Sahaja Yogis also about it. And when some Sahaja Yogis went to see one of them he said, "How many of you are willing to give your lives for that?" So, the Sahaja Yogis didn't know what to... They said, "We all can give life for Her." And I said, "Why do you want to take their lives for nothing at all?"

You see, these so-called 'Sahaja Yogis' who lived on the things have no idea as to what the world requires today. It requires peace. It requires complete evolution. They are just bothered about their own single evolutions. How far will go? You cannot anymore go because in the nature you have seen that nothing grows like a mango tree growing up to eighty feet, does it? It doesn't grow like that. In the same way anybody who tries to go like that goes out of place.

The yogi is a person who lives in this world. Is – the concept has come to you because some of these horrible fake ones have created this concept. You know, the great yogis of our country who are regarded and respected till today have been living in this world and never went away into the jungles. Say, like Guru Nanaka who was a great saint he says, "Kahe re ban Khojan jai,sarab niwasi sada ulepa tohi sang samai." [Dev. transcriptor's note: Internet links this sentence to Guru Tegh Bahadur who thus synthetized Guru Nanaka's teachings http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/gurudwaras-in-india/gurudwara-gurusar-sahib-patshahi-nauvin-village-kattu ] He says, "Why are you running away to the jungles? What are you afraid of? The one who is detached, the one who is the saint is living within you. The one who is the yogi is living within you. Where are you running away?"

So, these are the yogis and you can be one of them. And despite that I must tell you one thing, they are quite jealous of the Sahaja Yogis is a fact. Because they cannot raise the way – Kundalini – these people can raise. You'll be amazed. It's true. I must tell you this is a fact. They were saying that, "Mother what have you done?" Then we have a tape of a very great yogi from India. He says that, "What have these people done that You have given them vibrations while – he says – I was a frog for twenty-one thousand years I've practiced and then I've got my vibrations. And these people just like that getting vibrations. Why?" I said, "Maybe is the whim of God. Why are you sitting on the top of a hill there? For your own achievements, for your own courtesy. It's sort of a hypocrite in a very subtle way I would say."

And why are they there frightened of others, you see. You have to emancipate the whole world. Christ didn't go and sit on a hilltop or somewhere. No one. Rama did not go. Krishna did not go. None of these great saints like Tukaram, Gyaneshwara we have had. And all these they lived as married people, absolutely normal. And they are the people who are respected.

So, the idea of such a yogi is all dramatic, I can tell you. You'd better go and see some of them who are there in the horrible conditions as they live.

There's another one who lives in the Himalaya place called Amarnath. There he lives, you see – funny fellow. And he had one disciple – one disciple he had – and he sent the disciple to a suburb of Bombay, litlle – not suburb, I would say city near Bombay – small little place though and he said he formed an ashram there. And one of My Sahaja Yogini was staying there. So, he went and told her that, "My guru has told me that Mataji is going to come here after twelve years and She is going to raise my Agnya -Agnya Chakra." So, he went and asked the lady. She called Me he said, "I've been waiting for You for twelve years." Is a fact. You can go and see and find out. So, she was quite surprised that his guru has told him twelve years about Mataji coming here. It is quite surprising, you know. They didn't know that there was something about Me. And she came to Me and she told Me about this. I said, "All right, I'm coming to your place. You tell him to come and see Me."

He had ashram of his own. He was staying there and I said, "All right tell him, 'I'll come to your ashram'." He of course came to My program and all that and he was flat on the ground because he saw some things and all that but then he said, "Mother, my guru is waiting for you. Better come in the evening." I went down and, there, you see, I asked that guru, I said – of course first he was – all the rituals were done and then I asked him, "Why did you not clear his Agnya for twelve years?" He said, "Who cleared my Agnya? Why should I clear his Agnya Chakra?" I said, "I doesn't matter but you know how to clear." "Yes, I know but I will not clear his Agnya. Let him suffer." So, I said, "But what's the use of suffering?" He said, "It's very easy." "Why should you make him suffer like this?" He said, "I have suffered so much so he should also suffer." But then he gave him a big slap – I was between them. I said, "Why? Why did you beat him? It's very bad." He said, "No, you know, before, just before your coming he was smoking here. He has no shame of any kind."

And he was just, you see, going on like that. I said, "Why? What has happened?" He said, "You know, he came here, three days he put me upside down on the well and he said, 'Your smoking has to go'." So, that's how they are. Then I said, "All right, come along." And the Agnya can be cleared just like that you can also do it. But, you see, what happens there: they have achieved it through their terrible penances and all that and naturally they also expect people to do all that penance and go down there.

Now the individualistic is over. That was all right because in the beginning only one or two flowers become fruits but the blossom time comes, then many have to become. Unless and until all of them come down to this earth they are of no use. I can't understand their use. They are just sitting down there. Of course they work out certain things sitting down. Being – being sahaj, they are also collectively conscious so they may work out certain things and all that. But still you have to come and work with the people.

Supposing if you are away from the river and if you say, "I'm thirsty", what is so great? But if you are near the river and can keep your thirst then you are something great, isn't it? Living in the desert, if you say, "I am controlling my hunger and I am controlling my thirst and I have no attachments", it has no sense. Where are you great? If you are so strong enough anywhere you are, you are a sanyasin. You are detached.

Have you read the story of Sita's father, Janaka? He was called as Videhi, Videhi. He was the only one in the whole history called Videhi. 'Videhi' means 'a detached person from his being' like that 'he doesn't care for', as you can say 'a real yogi': 'Videhi'. The deha is the body. He has gone beyond the body. And he was the one who had children, who had wife, who had his kingdom and who was a great, what you can call a great connoisseur of heart. And when Nachiketa went to him because he was with a guru and whenever this king came to him the guru would get up, touch his feet and make him sit on his seat, so Nachiketa asked his guru, "Sir, why do you touch his feet? He is a householder. Why should you touch his feet? Why should we all get up? Because he is the father in law of Rama, that's why you do it, is it?"

He said, "'No, not because of that. Because he is Videhi. He is the one only who can give Realization. Even Yoga Vashishta could not give Realization. He is the only one who is authorized to give Realization. We cannot give Realization."

So Nachiketa went to him and asked him, "Sir, can you... (interruption) ...known myself."

He said, "Why do you want to know? It's rather difficult." All those things he showed and tried to see if he is really willing. See, for a non-willing person it is rather difficult. So, he took his test and all that and he said that, "All right, I'll see about it."

Then he asked him to sleep in a room where he saw that it was very lavishly decorated and all gold everything and he was wondering, "What sort of a yogi is this surrounded by gold and everything. He is sitting down here and he is supposed to be the greatest yogi of the ages. How is he called a Videhi?"

Because he was a king. That was his life and that's what he was like that. He was not taking money from anybody else, or [peer else?], other people's money. He was not a parasite. It was his own kingdom where he was living. So he looked it, he was surprised.

So, next day Raja Janaka told him that, "All right, now first of all let us go and have bath in the river." So, they went to the river, both of them were having a bath. While having the bath a message came to the king that, "Your palace is on the fire." So, he said, "All right. Just now I'm meditating." He didn't say a word and, "Don't disturb me." Still he was meditating. Then the message came that, "Your people have all come out of the palace and they are going away." Then the message came that, "The fire is coming this side and your cloths and all those might get caught fire." Still he was meditating. But this fellow who was in the – supposed to be the yogi, the one who had gone to learn detachment – ran outside for his cloths, you see. He couldn't – even he had very few cloths but he ran outside... (Interruption.) [Nachiketa] "...about these things which are so important like a palace and your family and all of them were running away." He said, "I was in tune with God. That is the Truth. The rest is all falsehood, is all Maya, is all illusion. And why worry about the illusions?" And he too had only one disciple only he gave Realization, is Nachiketa.

This is the trouble. If they could give Realization en-masse they may come down but they cannot. And one person born on the tenth floor, the rest on the ground floor cannot make them understand. They cannot understand him.

That's why Sahaja Yoga had to come as Mahayoga, as the greatest Yoga.

The manifestation today is of Mahayoga where you meet the divine, where thousands and thousands have to get it. The time has come. I call it the blossom time. Some people say it's the destruction time, some say it's the Judgement time, but I call it the blossom time. And this is the time when you have to receive it.

These concepts are not going to help you. They have never helped you neither helped anyone. So do not have concept about it, just have it. Once you have it then you practice it here. No use doing it in the forest because when you'll come back again then you will live in the same condition. Here you develop the immunity. In this world where you live among your family, among your people, here you develop that immunity.

You will know evil is evil and after Realization you will not like it. Gradually you will come up so well that evil will disappear. You will have to do it here in Brighton. Under all evil circumstances, we have to establish it. That's what it is. It's much more daring and much more challenging than to run away on the Himalayas very nicely and sit down there.

Whatever you are earning, whatever your life, wherever you live is perfectly all right. Nothing to be given up. If you are not holding to anything what is there to give up? This is a concept people don't understand, you know. Like these 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna' they came to Me also. They said, "Mother you have such a nice house and your husband is so well placed in life and you have everything around– while we have given up everything." I said, "What have you given up?" "Oh, we have given up this and we have given up that and that." I said, "Really? All right." I said, "You worship Shri Krishna?" They said, "Yes, we worship Shri Krishna." I said, "All right, now whatever you think here on My body or in this house worth the dust particle of Shri Krishna's feet you can take away. Even up to the dust particle you can take away if it is worth that much. So you see around everything. Whatever you think is equal to the dust particle of his feet you can take away." Now this was too much for them, they didn't expect. They went round and round. They said, "Now we don't think that anything is worth it." They gave in. I said, "What have you given up? These stones? The dust? Why do you live in myths? What are you going to give up?"...

51:18 (Interruption.)

...When it happens to you, you really enjoy it. Everything that he has created for your enjoyment. All this universe is created for your enjoyment but you don't have that sensitivity to enjoy it because you have a sense of possession. If you possess this room - if I possess that will be a headache. It's nice to have it for you people and I come and nicely talk here and go away. No headaches. So all these ideas are mythical. This is a myth also to feel that I possess this room. I mean, you cannot possess anything. You have to leave each and everything here.

What do you possess when you go? Your Self Realization. Then you'll be again born like these children are Self Realized before so they are born today as Realized souls. And they have been saints. They have been living on the Himalayas also but now they have come like brave people in this world to face the reality. It's not easy. After Realization you will know what I'm meaning.

All right? It's good. Today you don't have to give up anything. Nothing. It's just here within you. But Nanaka has said, "Unless and until you have got your Self Realization, this Bhrama, this illusion, this misunderstanding won't go. It's the curtain has to [be] moved."

Yogi: Three o' clock now

Shri Mataji: Now, how many of you are noting cool breeze in the hand? Just put attention to the hands. You are all realized souls. So, no problem. You are great. They are not complicate. Put both your hands [towards Me], feet on the ground like this, you see, for mother earth to correct your problems and thinks, you see. It's only a question of disintegrated being within, you see, like, "This is not corrected, this is loose, this is loose, this is loose, this is loose." These things are to be properly connected and this is to be put to mains. So these are the two problems that we are also disintegrated first of all and secondly we are not connected to the mains. So this disintegration also is brought to one by the Kundalini rising because She pierces through all your beings and put you together. Once you are integrated, then it works out faster.

Now see for yourself just like this. Just like this in this way. Sit most comfortably and just await this happening to you. You may close your eyes and see if there are any thought in your mind. Ask your mind, "What are you thinking?"

(Shri Mataji and the Yogis begin helping seekers to get their Realization.)

The back [probably Mother or a yogi is gently taping a back where there is a blocking.] You try this here.

55:10

I hear you all not forgive others. Please forgive. Just say that, "We forgive." Forgiveness is in captioned but it's a myth that you do not forgive. And what do we do after all by not forgiving this? Only troubling ourselves. Just forgive. Just say that, "We forgive." Then only you can be forgiven for your mistakes. That's why again and again you must say that, "I forgive" and "Please forgive us."

All right? Good! You are better? See. Looks out. Are you getting cool breeze? Little.

Yogini: Good.

Shri Mataji: What about you? Are you getting? Very good. This gentleman? Are you? Not yet. Are you getting cool breeze? Not yet. Left Nabhi very much. You know the left Nabhi problem is? You are all right. Don't you worry. Now is it? Good.

Close your eyes and enjoy. This is the best time when you get it. This is the highest. Remember it! Because you will find it that after some time you will start thinking about it, you may lose it, so petty think about it, what you call. Just feel it. Feel the relaxation.

Left Nabhi is too much. You don't pay attention to one particular point. Keep your attention absolutely free. May people have a habit of looking into this – what you call – in between the two eyebrows or sometimes higher.

(Interruption.)

Let pay attention to your fontanel bone here on top of the head. If you find your attention to be very variably, then let us leave it alone. That's the best way.

1:00:55

Better? Left Nabhi's? Good. Where guru you have [been]? See don't you get worried. That's the use that they are doing to people. Is it okay? Still a little one there. Better now. It works. That's such a collapse, quite a lot. There leave it. It's painful absolute. Now better. Are you getting the cool breeze? Not yet. Are you? This one. Not yet? It has started.

Now how is your Hamsa today? You're welcome.

And what about this gentleman in the corner, behind Me? No. He has got it...

1:09:00

... They say tendency is here a harm, here, that people sort of feel guilty about everything. There is nothing to feel guilty. In a people, you can feel this. They say something is happening in Vietnam, they feel guilty about it. Of course, if you are in the collective consciousness, if you feel that, then you can feel bothered, but otherwise mentally if you feel guilty, then it creates a problem. So just say, "I'm not guilty of anything." Just say that. After all this [body] is the temple of God and in the temple of God, there is a light [Atma]. I mean I have no business to despise it in any way. All right?...
