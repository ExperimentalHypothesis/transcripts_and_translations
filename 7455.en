I bow to all the seekers of truth.

I have been coming to Turkey in the last ten years. And I found this place is so much filled with spirituality.  Perhaps we have had so many Sufis here, must be something in this country is that there were so many Sufis were created. And I have read about them and I have read about Rumi and all others.  And I find they described the qualities of a Sufi the state of his mind, very beautiful. But they didn't say how created, how to became Sufis. They described of course  very well  and absolutely  truthfully  whatever was the achievement. But nobody could say that how they achieved it. Even in the Koran you see how Muhammed Sahab has described  that he went through seventh heavens  on a white horse.  He was a poet and the whole thing was so poetic. The white horse was this Kundalini.  The more you will know about Kundalini you will see how poetically. He had described all these seven heavens he crossed over. So, unless and until you are self realized soul as he has said "know thy self". Unless and until you know your self you can not understand any one of this scriptures. They say, all of them say the same thing  in different ways and also in poetry. And it is difficult for common people to understand. In no way there is difference in the explanations of all these scriptures, they are just the same. Then there is no question of people fighting because there is no difference  what they are fighting for. But  problem was one individual gets the self realization and the others don’t understand  they torture that person. As you know Christ was crucified and all the saints, all the sages were tortured. Even in China there was this Tao. It was the same thing as Sahaja Yoga but it was written in such a manner that people could not understand it or I think couldn't take it what it was written. Also I find in Japan, Vidittama is a disciple of (mahatma welcome book. Gautam Budda) He said the same things, he tried to practice Sahaja Yoga through various methods all was nothing but Kundalini awakening.

Now the thing is of understanding then go to any limit of stupitidies. There was a great poet called Kabir in India and whatever he told was so much misunderstood by people that you can not imagine  what interpretations they do. He says in one  poetry that my beloved went away and  I  did not  cry. Now people think beloved means a lover. It is what he was meaning was a life  life went away. But, I did not cry,   I didn't say anything. So he was saying about the death while people all these thinks it is some sort of a beloved he is talking about. Thus you see, we have problems, of people fighting  who said they are fighting is a name of religion. To understand they have  first you take your self realization.

You have to know yourself. Unless and until you know yourself how will you understand the subtle ideas they want to look forward. So whatever they have told you about  the Kundalini it is a fact, it is a fact and  resides within you in the triangular bone. You could be a Muslim you could be a Hindu, you could be a Christian anything. Even people from Africa came. They were black, some were white, some were yellow, all of them have got this Kundalini within them. As  God has created us the same. we all have noses, hands everything,  everywhere whatever languages we may speak. Now, Sahaja means, saha means "with" and ja  "born with you". The right to get this yoga, union with the divine, the Ruh (Spirit). You all have this right and now it is going to work out that you have to know yourself through the Kundalini awakening. All this may be not written in those books. Perhaps that was not the time to write or maybe these books were written after long time  after the prophet went away, Christ die in all that. So there are certain sacrifice you see. But it is a fact that, you whole have, all of you have this power within you, this energy within you which we call as Kundalini. It has been proved now because wherever I have gone many countries various type of people were there and they all got their realization. Especially in Turkey is a very dear country to me because of so many people who were here and  who  were  spiritually so equipped they might call themselves  as Sufis,  I mean Sufi means [UNCLEAR]. So it cleanses, means this Kundalini rising cleanses you of your problems, of your enemies. Because it connects you to the all pervading power which we call as Ruh and all your personality absolutely get absorbed with the truth.

The first thing that happens to you when she rises, sometimes it is you just  become thoughtlessly aware. The thoughts come to us because we react. We see something immediately we react. We react according to our ego or maybe according to our conditioning. But when the Kundalini she rises and crosses this center upward then your thoughts stop. Then you become a witness. You witness without thinking. Thought  rises then falls  then another thought comes up, rises and falls. There is a space, very little space in between but we cannot see that space, we can not in there  that space. Now these thoughts who are all the time [UNCLEAR] hoovering  in your head and our  mind cruise or jumping on them doesn’t allow us to be in the present because they come from the past and from the future. So we cannot be in the present. Past is finished it does not exist and the future is no more, so what we have to do is to stay in the present. And in the present is the reality, is the truth. That is how we can not enjoying.

For example, I see a very beautiful carpet here, very beautiful and I start reacting on it and then I start thinking of how much is that  cost, can I have it, all things is possible. But I can not watch it. Because I can not watch it the joy that  is put by the artist  in the sight I can not enjoy it. So when this Kundalini rises what she does,  she elongates those toughs there is a space   between a  thought. So we can see everything without thinking and enjoy fully. And with this enjoyment we get peace, complete peace. We do not aggress others, we enjoy others. They have  many peace conferences but those who are having the conference have no peace within –then what is the use of having the conference? We have six enemies within us at least which are all the time torturing us. They are described in the Sanskrit language very beautifully but I will tell them, that's now [UNCLEAR].

First is the anger. That is so common,  comes out of  so much of conditioning may be so much of ego. Then the perversion, perversion of sex or  all kinds of dirty things people do it. Then we have false pride, now we have jealousy, we have attachments. People are corrupt because they are attached to their children, they want to make money for them, so  they are corrupt. And we have  also attraction. We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted, say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house attractions. We cannot explain. We cannot explain why we do that. Why we suffer from all these enemies we don't know.

Once you become the spirit, spirit drops out everything, it is so clear, so clean, and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart. The spirit , that is within you. once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person, such a nice person and you develop this spirituality. What, actually what happens is that when  Kundalini rises your spirit starts emitting vibrations spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system. And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands out of your fontanel bone area. And then this  fingers which represent the centers within you  starts speaking telling you  what's wrong and what's kind. Also they tell you about others,  what is wrong with the others.

This connection with the divine gives you this blessing that you  know what is wrong with you and what is wrong with others. Even the doctors will not tell you, nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam (to stand up) your hands will speak. So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat (Apocalypse) is different. [UNCLEAR] Kıyamat and kıyama, Kiyam because this is the last judgement. Those who do not accept their self realisation, and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity, they go to hell – that is the wisdom. So, for you it is important that your hands must speak and tell you about you and others. That is how you are Mussulman, otherwise you are not. If your hands do not speak than you are not a Mussulman in surrendering. It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran but once you be  able to read it after  you have got your realization. It is high time that you should realize that we  have been following something so much and why is it we are in trouble, why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

It is something missing that so far we have not been able to achieve what is doing promised. You all can have your self realization. Don’t have any fear about it and some sort of funny ideas about it. Because whatever will happen, you will feel it. It`s not something imaginary. It’s the actualization. To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism. So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come to have that self realization. It was prophesied that it will happen collectively. And so, you all deserve it. And you should have it. Because İt is what  is promised. So ultimately what happens that you jump in the ocean of joy. You become powerful. But you don't have ego. And you know how you get help others and yourself and help the family. All of you can get  it. I mean those who want can all get it ,  it can't be forced [UNCLEAR]. Thus you will know what you are and also what others are. Many people have  been cured in Sahaja yoga, no doubt. We also have a hospital in India. Where people are cured without any medicine with their own vibrations. Moreover mentally there are so many people  who have been cured. And your problems are solved. Because you get out  of your problems. Will be amazed how miraculously  you achieve such small small things which really look great [UNCLEAR] to begin with.

Every human being has a right  to get self realization. All negative forces and energies  just drop out and run away. Just like whether light comes in all darkness goes away. It sometimes  people don't believe. Because, they don't think they are  capable of getting self realization. But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are. Will be absolutely relaxed person and the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love. It's not because of me, it's because of you. You have once you have what only  I have to open the window here. That to you do because It is your desire, to become your pure desire to be. Otherwise no other desire is pure. All economics is based on one point  that no human desire is complete.

Today you want  to have one thing then  you want to have another thing. And you are never satisfied. But this  is pure desire. Kundalini is the energy of pure desire  because the desire of our Almighty So, when you get your realization, you feel absolutely satisfied and  enjoy whatever you have. And also you enjoy others and their things without thinking that they don't belong to you. The whole panorama changes and you become a very universal personality. You really become global and everybody who is in Sahaja yoga are such great friends.

I'll give an example that  Palestinians were fighting Israelis and one of the Israeli fellow, telephoned  to me that Mother we have some Sahaja Yogis  in  the  one of the villages of  Palestine. They were friends,  despite the fact that [UNCLEAR] is fighting, countries were fighting. But they were Sahaja Yogis, so they were friends they are friends. So this Israilian knew that  they are going to drop a big bomb in a particular village and he told me that please pay  attention Mother  I don't want  people to be killed  there. I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb. Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all. We have never used it. We have always use hatred to over power others. We have never used love.

There is divine love allover  allover the World  that's why we are existing . You have to just become one within that's all. It's allover, it is called Ruh , It's allover. But we have not yet felt. But today is now, you have the time to feel it. For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything, it will  just work automatically. Have faith in yourself. Do not condemn yourself. This will change the whole world. Once they realize that there is divine love  which [UNCLEAR] us. So, the first state is thoughtless awareness and the second state  is what we called  as the doubtless awareness. That state comes to people automatically sometimes together and they have no doubts about it. It works that way.  It doesn't give you any doubts anymore  you are sure this is what it is.

Today somebody came to see me he used to perspire and hot. And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart, to  look working very hard. I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization his perspiration stopped. So I told him that you should forgive, forgive others and that worked. And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill  or dead by that kind of a  heart. So you get an awareness which is doubtless. So all those who want to have their self realization please stay on. If you don't want to have should live the hall. One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

There are many false people  who are doing all  kinds of nonsense, only thing is you must take  to your self realization. So that you all become Sufis. You don't have to give up everything. Or you don’t have to become an ascetic, and I am a married  woman, have for  children, I have for  grandchildren and I have got  their grandchildren . But I am what I am. That’s what should happen to you. So again I would request those who don’t want have  their  self realization to  leave the hall. Like this, like this, just like this. Yes.

Now  close your eyes. Please close. See If you are feeling cool breeze on your fingertips Now please open your eyes, put your left hand towards me and put the right hand bend your head and put the right hand  against the fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

See if you this coming  on the left hand, little it should be above the head not on  top, bend your head and see for yourself. Move your hand and see for yourself. Now please put your right hand towards me, not touching the head above left hand on the top of your head. All those who have felt cool or  hot breeze on their fingertips or in the palm or upper to fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

All of you got realization, congratulations.

May God bless you.
