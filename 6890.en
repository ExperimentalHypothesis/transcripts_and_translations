Talk to yogis. Delhi (India), 17 March 1984.

I wish you all happy Holi.This is a wonderful festival started by Shri Krishna long time back.After the advent of Rama, who was a very serious gentleman and who believed in a very sacrificing life of a benevolent king, when all these things were so much prevalent in the air that one has to be a benevolent person, one has to be charitable, one has to be sac-rificing, one has to be serious and like the king - the whole atmosphere of the society was very serious atmosphere. Anything extreme if we do, we go to the wrong side as you know. So the whole society became a very serious society. In that seriousness it started taking to lot of ritualism. And the rituals of the time that were very absurd and funny. Like you shouldn't eat this food, you shouldn't touch this water, somebody should not touch you, you must take your bath, and in that wet clothes you must cook. All sorts of absurd things they started of as the - what you call the dharma - they thought this was the dharma, the ritualism of the worst type started. So much so that the brahmins in those days were not realized souls. They started giving them lot of ideas that if you give a cow to the Brahmin you will get moksha, or you must give this to brahmin, you must do that to brahmin. [Unclear] was all become a beggar's house.

All these upset Shri Krishna very much, and as you know, all incarnations follow the 'Samayachar'. Samayachar means at that moment at that time whatever is the situation. And the samayachar at that time, He found that He had to flout all these vidhi-nishedhas by which you say this is good that is bad.

Now, this happened actually in the North when Shri Krishna was here. And Shri Krishna never went down to the South till He became the King. So again [we can?] find the dif-ference between the North Indians and the South Indians that the South Indians don't celebrate Holi much. They celebrate other festivals but not this Holi festival so much. And here you see as everything has a bad result, somehow human beings know, whatever one does, you get into a bad result.

So when Shri Krishna said it is a leela, it is God's leela. Everybody thought He is the 'Leela'. He became the leelamayi. So the gradual settling of this another abandonment, sort of temperament started in the North. That's why you find the people in the North are frivolous compared to the people in the South. The South can be - you can call them ab-solutely sometimes jada, ritualistic, very much bound by rituals. While in the North you find people absolutely abandoned, nothing in between. So this abandonment came in the north quite a lot, though some of the people stuck on to these very ritualistic things. So we had two types of people here. Those who were just frivolous - they would only cele-brate Holi, nothing else. For them no other function was higher than the Holi. Because Holi was frivolous and in the Holi they thought they can also take to drinks, they can take bhang, this, that. Actually Holi hasn't got that significance that you can take those intoxi-cating drugs. It is not so because Shri Krishna never drank. It is only the Shiva, who never incarnates but who drinks, means in the sense that He consumes all the drugs and all these intoxicating things within Himself. So there is no sense. I can't understand why people started taking bhang during Holi because they must have thought that if you have to be abandoned, you have to get rid of all your inhibitions, it is better to take to some sort of a drug like bhang and go mad and amuck. But it was never the case of Shri Krishna. He never went amuck.

So the whole system has been misused in the North and same in the South that people have become extremely ritualistic, just jada, on the left side. And the North people are right sided without any inhibitions about this. And that's why you find that the North In-dian people do very well in the Western countries because they can adjust themselves better.

Now this frivolity is not the game of Shri Krishna. He is never frivolous. He plays. He plays tricks but never frivolous. Inside, He is so deep. You know He is Yogeshwara. He is Yogeshwara, and how can Yogeshwara be frivolous man? He doesn't do it for frivolity. But He plays it in such a way that people, who get into problems, He tries to play tricks in such a way that the tricks are not felt injurious, or blatant, or in any way dangerous, or shocking to the people who need His help. So He does it in such a beautiful manner that He can just turn His finger, and He can create a situation in which a person becomes aware that He is [doing all?].

Now you know that I played so many tricks Myself, and you have all experienced those tricks that I play upon you. Now this is just to kill your ego, to kill your over-astuteness, or over-emphasis on laws and order, kaida kanun. And some people are extremely strict about time. So to put them out of time, you see, you can play lots of tricks with their watches. You can play tricks with their timing and all that. So to take you beyond, to take you beyond the time, the gunas, and the dharmas, Shri Krishna created a new awareness of leela in which the whole world is a leela. But it's only leela for people who are real-ized and settled in Realization. Not for people who are still imbedded in this ignorance. They are not the one who can do [this?].

So the Holi became a game. Holi was played only by [Gopa and Gopis?]). They were re-alized souls. So they played the Holi was alright. But nowadays everybody thinks he can play Holi's. Whatever sins they may commit, all their lives they can do the Holi. It is not allowed. It is not allowed to people who can, everybody cannot play Holi. It is only for the realized souls that they can play Holi.

Then in this way you have noticed that when you are realized there is no jati-paati. You all become one caste. You are yogis. You all become yogis. There is no jath, there is no caste. There is no community. There is no race. There is no consciousness of class, and this class, and that class. Is all finished. You all sit together in one line thinking that you are a yogi. You will see a person coming from a very rich heritage, somebody who is earning thousands of rupees or pounds, and the another one is a very ordinary man - might be a just a sweeper also doesn't matter, he is a Sahaja Yogi. He is a Sahaja Yogi. Among Sahaja Yogis there is no caste system. There is no higher and lower ranking or anything like that. But you have to be a Sahaja Yogi to play the Holi, to meet each other with love, and make love in a way expressed that people feel that you are a recipient and a giver of love. Like people embrace. Men embrace a men, women embrace women, and they also... That's how you pass your vibrations [through it?]. That's how you express outwardly your love to your own body because you are all part and parcel of the same body. And if you are part and parcel of the same body, then this hand must look after this hand, this hand must look after this hand. What you are doing is just you are circulating your love into this Virata's body, and so that the whole body feels the oneness. That's the situation [it is?].

Then the colors are, the colors are all representing your chakras. These are all the chakras as you know. Every chakra has got different color. So what happens? These colors just get distributed in the air, in the atmosphere. During Holi time you [know you?] are repre-senting those colors which are completely permeating into the atmosphere. So this is an-other thing when you play colors. When you color another person, you are just expressing that these, your chakras will be blessed. Red color is of the Mooladhara. All those colors that you use here are of different chakras. So just you are making the whole expression of your love that let it be you become completely filled with red color, means innocence, means innocence. Because as a child in the womb of the mother just sees the red color of the mother, color of the blood.

So like that you see different colors are spread on the face. And [abhira?] is the green color of the guru tattwa. Like that all these colors have got significance that they are the colors of your chakras which you are spreading all over to your friends, to your other brothers and sisters who are Sahaja Yogis. So it has that symbolic expression that you are spreading your - actually the essence of your chakra, the basis of your chakra, the colors of your chakra, the fragrance of those chakras to other Sahaja Yogis. You just permeate, permeating. I don't know in Hindi language if there is a better word like in Marathi 'ud-har', udahr. 'Udhar' means just...

[Translation Hindi to Enlgish]

I will now talk in Hindi, that you people are scared about giving money. This is wrong. I am surprised hearing this. If there is a puja, Bombay yogis would be competing amongst each other, as to how much one would give (donation). Here one has to ask for money, but in Bombay people spend thousands and made a rule, that so much we should keep for God’s work. It’s a shameful thing that these people have to ask you for money. These things shouldn’t happen. Next time I don’t want to hear that they had to ask for money.

This is God’s work. You come here and get so many benefits, your health improves. You can’t give time for yourself, you cannot meditate. You have all otherworldly things to do, but not meditation. No time for meditation. Meaning, Mother I had to go to the markets to buy things, but no time for meditation. I had to get my blouse made, I had to go to the conference, that’s why I didn’t meditate. Get up at 4 o’clock. The important thing is to meditate. The bigger goal is meditation. If you don’t go to these things nothing will happen. Like these, I have seen thousands who give unnecessary importance to office work because I know what they are. I have seen these types all my life. Today I had these things in the office, I got stuck in the office all other excuses. But no meditation. Such a small thing you can do. You want all things done by Mother. What have we done for Mother? You should all think about it. What have I done for Mother?.

The very basic thing is how much money I have given? I (Shri Mataji) give so much money. Sir CP is not a Sahaja Yogi. But his discretion about donating money for this work (Sahaja yoga)is very powerful because he knows he gets the benevolence. And he gets it (laughter). He is getting the benefits of donating and you don’t. Then you say that I am not getting any job, making a loss. It will happen. He is a clever man (Sir CP). But you are all for small amounts. I am surprised.

All like to travel in private cars. Everybody has got a motor vehicle. Got petrol. Going about in pomp. Showing off. This showing off is very common in North India. Want to have nice clothes, nice food. The house should be beautiful. Grand pompousness. It’s all surfacing. But in your temple (body) how much light (deep/lamp) is shining? Be simple. Go towards simplicity, then you will go inwardly. I am not saying that you should be a vagabond. Not at all. But one should be traditional. Live traditionally. But human beings’ glamorous and show off attitude should finish. We are not English, that we wear three-piece suits. What’s the need of wearing suits. Wear our countries’ clothes. Live like Indians. In that is our glory. Unnecessarily showing off. There is so much showing off here, what can I say. I can’t understand. Once our servant’s wife came to meet me. I wasn’t aware that she was our doorman’s wife. She had very nice branded clothes on her. I asked her to sit on the sofa. I did not know she was the doorman’s wife. She was wearing nice branded clothes. She was looking around. She said to me, “ Mother, I am the wife of the doorman”. So, I (Shri Mataji) said, “now that you are wearing such nice clothes, you better sit on the sofa, not on the floor.” (Laughter in the crowd). Same thing with the laundryman. We had a dhobi (laundryman who we knew fora long time and he is still with us. Dhobis are such that they will wear anyone’s suit/clothes. (Laughter). That is dhobis make. (Laughter).  He came to us in a suit and asked how he looked. I said, “this is Sir CP’s suit.” (Laughter). “At least don’t come to our house wearing Sir CP’s suit. (Laughter). The laundryman was quite tall. "That’s why you don't spare us and wear Sir’s suit." (Laughter). This is how bad a situation we are in. Meaning we will wear anybody’s suit to show off. How long will this showing off last? How Long? Not even for a moment.

The inner royalty is what matters. And we are not traditional. The women will wear sleeveless blouses. I have seen it that instantaneously they will wear it. I haven't heard or seen any gods or goddesses wearing sleeveless clothes. Once in Delhi, my daughter asked me, “all the girls wear sleeveless clothes in our school. Can we wear them?” I (ShriMataji) said as you wish. She (daughter) said to me, “why don’t you wear it?” I said, “I have never worn it, and feel shy and embarrassed. Why should I expose my body?  It’s not the right thing.” She said (daughter), “if it’s not right then why don’t you say not to wear it.” I said, “you have discretion, you decide for yourself. If I don’t wear and you want to wear, why should I force you?” She (daughter) said, “this is not the criteria that if I asked and you said yes.” I said (Shri Mataji), “you can think in your understanding why Maa (Shri Mataji) doesn't wear.” To wear long-necked and sleeveless clothes doesn’t suit Sahaja yogis. You should give up these things. Wear decent clothes, which are traditional. You (for women) should wear toe rings, payal (anklets), mangalsutra. Should be sensible women.  They will cut their hair. Why should you cut your hair short?. Are we English? Why? Can’t understand. In our culture, the widows cut their hair. Even for the widows, it’s completely shaved. Not shortened and go to hairdressers and roam about. This doesn’t suit Sahaja yogis.

The same dilemma with the men. I have heard that some men, even Sahaja yogis do a lot of fashion. Fashion in Sahaja yoga is of no splendour. You don’t carry any dignity. Such a man does not carry any respect. In the west, once we had a cabinet minister’s wife, they were South Indian. The wife thought someone very great about herself. She was skinny. Once we went to a party for dinner. There they received us all with great respect. This person (chief cabinet secretary) when seated asked where is your wife? He said my wife didn’t come? Where did she go? Then he was told that one of his secretaries is here. What we saw was that his wife had arrived and reached there in jeans. She thought that she was very beautiful, loitering around. In real fact, if a woman doesn't have any dignity, she looks like a clerical person who has arrived or looks like a debt collector. (this is how Indian women look in the West). Who wears such clothes?. It’s not a good thing to wear clothes like this. Our dignity is in our hands.

If you don’t respect yourself the world won’t respect you. What type of clothes you wear, you should behave in a way by which the country feels proud. Wear our traditional clothes. Yes, sometimes we have to wear these clothes formally. So wear them. But no need to wear suitsall the time. Here I see lots of Sahaja yogis to show off by wearing these. The yogis from the west say that Mother over there yogis wear suits and boots. We don’t like it much. They don’t like it much. Because for them you are copying them. They think how strange these people are. They have such beautiful clothes. They wear them. It is so hot, but they still wear these clothes(suits). They don’t have any pride.

Those who have self-respect, do not follow such glamour. A person who is decadent tries to be glamorous. He might place the tin on top of his head and make a hairdo on top of it, and then the tin falls off. (Laughter). Or decorate the hair funny. What’s the point? No need for this. You live a very simple life. Have you seen a Devi following such nonsense?. They did that to me once, I looked like a bhoot. Got a headache. How do people bear such nonsense? But why do they have to bear it? Nobody gets any benefit out of it. Nobody is happy, joyful. If you see, one actually feels very anxious.

So, you should understand the leela (playfulness) that Shri Krishna has, in that leela there is balance, there is sweetness, in that there is no disgust. Like some person with horrible coloured hair and large glasses comes towards you and scares you. There is balance in him (Shri Krishna). When you look at his dress, he would wear Pitamber (yellow dhoti). Tell me how many people would wear Pitamber here? Which Krishna wore. They will say (people) if I wear Pitamber then I will look rural. When he (Shri Krishna) wore a crown, he would wear a peacock feather as a crown. Because he was a God, so he had to wear a crown, so hewould wear a peacock feather as a crown. But here the men do funny hairdos. They are following all nonsense. What is the use of this?. One should follow the real thing. One should understand that we have to follow reality. Human beings' inner reality is very interesting and beautiful. And when he follows all sorts of nonsense then his form becomes a disgusting form. Extremely disgusting.

I have seen lots of big people and their wives like this. I’d like to share with you, one Sahab came wearing a fancy bow on his neck to us, showing off. There were some westerners and they thought that he must be a waiter and so gave him all the glasses thinking the same (Shri Mataji and everyone laughing). I thought these raja maharajas have lost their senses. (Laughter). Once this happened with Me (Shri Mataji), I went to a party and there the ambassador from India came, dressed like a westerner. I thought, must be someone who they sent as a waiter and gave him my glass. Suddenly Sir CP came up rushing up and said, “what are you doing, giving the glass to him? He is the ambassador. I (Shri Mataji) was surprised. (Laughter). I ( Shri Mataji) thought if he had worn a proper Indian closed neck top which is a traditional and formal Indian suit, I would know he was the ambassador. But what is that he was wearing, a frilled neck bow tie, just like the waiters wear. I said you should wear sensible clothes.The same in England at the Queen’s party, the same thing happened. All this we have learned from the English. There you have to wear a lounge suit. Not everybody has it. There is a hire company called ‘Moss Brothers’, where you hire this. Now, these normal people who wear this don’t walk properly, they walk very funny. Tight clothes. Some have things flowing till down and so on. (Laughter). Like clowns. I could not stop laughing. They were all looking funny. By God’s grace when I was there, they changed the rules that you could wear your traditional clothing, otherwise, I said that I wouldn’t have come with you (Sir CP) and walked like a clown. (Laughter).

Then you get variety. You get people wearing their national dress. With variety there is beauty. Everyone wears clothes according to their tradition. In their country, the tradition builds up. Like in our tradition, what is necessary for our country that slowly builds up and gets tied up to a nice tradition, which gives splendour to us, is useful for us. Leaving all that, what is the need to wear English clothes. Either they will wear clothes like English or wear clothes as they wear on the beach. Both things are not dignified for our country. The people of our country are very sublime. Because they have built up lots of good deeds from past lives. Those who were born here. These people (westerners) don’t know of their past lives, less talking about their good deeds.

Your previous lives have been of auspicious deeds, by which you were born in this country. And after being born in this country, you should live with dignity. Also, the woman should live in dignity. You see, once you start wearing Indian style clothes, you will be respected, people will like you. They will acknowledge you. In this matter people in Maharashtra are very much... they won’t give up that easily. In the rural area definitely not at all, no matter what. I am saying you should wear traditional clothes, all types of jewellery/ornaments. No problem with that. Because this is our country’s tradition. And these ornaments you see, they all glorify these chakras. But there is no need for you to wear frocks like English people and their clothes. Yes, if sometimes you have to wear them for formal occasions then it’s ok.But mostly Sahaja yogis should wear clothes from their own country.To wear clothes from your own tradition. If you go to England you can wear clothes like English. (Now Shri Mataji Talks in English)....

[Shri Mataji speaks in English]

...red color, is the sign of innocence. So Kabira says that, "You put me into such a color. Oh, the one who is going to color me is the One". Rangaraj is the one who colors things. So He says, "Oh Rangaraj, make me so that the whole thing becomes red - innocence, fills me up with complete innocence." And innocence is the one he has asked for to be filled in. And same is with Shri Krishna that He played with all these different colors to show that there are different charkas within us apart from the red and the others that are there. All of them play a part to create a beautiful joyful personality.

So the people who are of eccentric nature, one sided, one-track man and unusually seri-ous, if you see a conference of some, say, Western people, they are sitting very seriously like, you see, thinkers. And when it comes to frivolity, they are so stupid that I have seen eighty year old people doing the shake dance. They are already shaking, you know [laughing]. Plus they are doing the shake dance with a stick in the hand, you see, shaking [laughing]. And very well placed people, very well placed. They behave in such a stupid manner that you can't understand. Either they become stupid or unnecessarily serious drawn people, you see, showing-off as if they are very great thinkers. So these things are not necessary at all to put up a show. But it is something within yourself that you feel joyous and that a child-like. You [are?] become child-like. Your smile, laughter, every-thing is child-like, innocent, and that's what should happen to all of you.

Now the Holi day is to be celebrated in Delhi. I'm very happy because in the North only Holi should be celebrated I think because here it is Shri Krishna [where?] did His leela, and He had this Holi time. But now I'm going to tell you one more thing about Shri Krishna which is important. One must know, which I never have a chance to tell you about health problems we have from the wrong ideas about Holi or about Shri Krishna. Firstly, the foremost thing about Shri Krishna you must know that He is Yogeshwara. He is detached. He is pure. So those who play Holi - sometimes I find they get involved [with people?] in a funny way. That sort of a thing is absolutely not the Holi. It is anti-Holi. Actually it is satanic. Because whatever is not liked by Shri Krishna if it is done, then it is satanic. They play Holi in a way that they try to have their perverted tempera-ment expressed. Secondly, the people who play Holi should know that they must put some oil on their body because Shri Krishna likes oil. They must eat some butter. Then they, or if they want, they can have some ghee put in their nose which is very important, and something in the ear to be put, some oil, that is very good. Because this is all drying things.

So if you put all these things, then your Vishuddhi Chakra (will improve?). Specially the Vishuddhi Chakra should be covered with lot of ghee or with what you call the makhan, is butter. You put it here, and rub it on here [unclear]. Those people who have Vishuddhi Chakra... If they do it every day, - two drops of this ghee, and in the ear also one drop of oil, and here little ghee or makhan, the butter, is put here every day, will help you to have, at the back also, to have a very good Vishuddhi. Because Shri Krishna was fond of it. And He believed that the ladies of, the milkmaid from Gokul used to take all their but-ter to be sold in Mathura where these horrible rakshasas were living, and they were, you see, nourished with this butter. And this nourishment of the butter was making them very strong. So that's why He used to manage to steal the butter of these ladies for His own consumption and for the consumption of all the other children of Gokul because it should not go to these rakshasas. And this was His idea.

But the essence of His life is this that one should understand that Shri Krishna what He preached is that for a higher goal you have to sacrifice the lower goals. This is the main thing - tattwa of His life, the principle of His life. For a higher goal you can sacrifice the lower goal. Like the lower goals are, now some people are, now this [unclear] [Take?] - the case of He is stealing the butter. He just stole butter, nothing else. Because butter was very important for the Vishuddhi Chakra of the Gokul people because with that they would have developed their self respect, their courage, and they would have raised their neck against these horrible rakshasas in Mathura. So it was important and [vital? invit-ing?] in those days to have this butter for the people. So the principle is you should not steal. Then how you can you steal butter? But the higher goal is to preserve the Vishuddhi Chakras of the people, so for that sake you can steal. But in our country, you see, every-thing can be understood very well in such a manner that you pervert it. Like now people think if Krishna used to steal, why not we steal? We can steal government money to fill our tummy. We can steal all their money from the people and have our own children be-ing cropped up. This is from higher goal to the lower goal. Just the other way round. So perverted. That from the higher goal to the lower goal. Now, for example, if you have to do something, say, for Mother, that is much more important than anything else. But when it comes to doing, first do for yourself and lastly for Me. That's all. And this is what I have to tell you today about something important which I should not mention.

[Talk for duration 19.29 to 34.58 continued in Hindi]

If you go to England, you can wear a dress like English. Because now that dress which-ever has come traditionally to them, has come because that suits that country. And when you come to India dress up like India. If supposing if you have to wear three-piece-suit here with a tie, I don't know how many of you will exist to go back. We'll have to just send back your suits. Can you think of three-piece-suits in India? It is so comfortable, you see, to be dressed up like the way the country is. And if it works out that you can keep up your dress here, you can. But you cannot. You know that very well. It is very suitable, comfortable dress that you have here, and is better to have a comfortable dress here where the tradition has brought it to that level that you wear such and such dress. So what I am trying to tell Indians that they need. Now you all can say that you don't like Indians, Indian ladies wearing frocks, do you? You would like to have Indian ladies wearing frocks? [pausing and people denying] That's it. So what I am trying to tell them that it doesn't suit. Your face is different, your style is different, you should wear your own dress. Instead of we are trying to follow you in your dress, in your behavior, in liv-ing.

Some British parliamentarians have come to my house for dinner. He said, "Yours is the only house we find is Indian. Otherwise all the Lords who have disappeared from Eng-land have to come to India."

I said, "Why?"

"See, they have all the styles, the napkins, these, the bearers everything done in that way."

No thali nothing, you never see plates, the courses, and even in England you don't find these things. You see very few people have courses, and they converging these spoons, forks, this, that, all things done in very meticulous way. Just like the English. Imagine. How can you have Indian food in that fashion? Can you? Imagine Indian food in courses [people laughing]. First you'll get rasam. [people laughin very much] Then idli. Then this, then that. And the Madrasis will say, "Baba, get away from here." [laughing] It is better to have plantain leaf than to have this course business. [laughing] How can you eat Indian food like that? And with the chapattis, you see, they start the course in a North Indian style. Then first the chapattis and with that only vegetables. Then with something else, something else, you will say, "Now, we are fed up, we're finished." With chapattis you eat with everything whatever you want. There's a choice you have. Now you start the courses here. This is the trouble is that we do not understand the value of tradition in our country. We should understand the value of our traditions, and every country we should understand the value of traditions. Whatever are good traditions are to be taken into con-sideration, are to be used by all the Sahaja Yogis.

As I told you that Krishna's main essence was to sacrifice the higher goal - no, just the other way. [laughing] Is Indian style is to sacrifice the higher goal for the lower goal, you see. But Krishna's style was to sacrifice the lower goal for the higher goal. He didn't be-lieve in anything, you see. He didn't believe in time, He didn't believe. So some people, you see, all the time slaves of this thing. So I played tricks. As I told you, He didn't be-lieve in time. The way He did everything was so child-like sweet, beautiful, and the way He used to turn round people. You see, like Sudhama, when he came to Him to meet. Imagine. Then Sudhama, an old friend of His, with all tattered, torn clothes he comes to the main door. He rushes there with all his ornaments, everything. Just hugs him [into...?]. Otherwise, you see, here, say, if you meet somebody. I know some of the min-isters who were just like, they used to wear half pants before Me, little, little boys you see. But you go there. "It is alright. Make Her sit there." Then you sit down there for two hours in a cold room, then they just come, and look at you, and they say, "I don't recog-nize. Who are you?" Your own brother can do the same. This is the country. Now so this is not the thing, you see. He, for Him love was the main thing. How to express love, how He rushed out with all His ornaments, everything, without wearing chappals He just rushed out opened the door - "Oh God, My great friend has come. Ah!" He didn't see whether he had taken a bath or not. He is coming all the way. Here people will say, "Oh God! My sari will be spoiled. My clothes will be spoiled. It should be clean. It should be [this?]". Don't learn all these bad habits. In love nobody is [different?]. In love nobody thinks of these things. What is 'clothes', can be changed. But a heart which is hurt, we cannot change. We hurt the people for small, small things.

Like I knew another horrible lady who lived in America. She looked like a [aryer?] all the time to Me otherwise. But she used to think no end of herself. She used to tie up her hair like this, you see. She had her own style. I don't know what it was. I couldn't locate that in America. And this one was so particular about her time, you see. So one day she in-vited us for tea, and we all were to go. Now Myself and Mrs. Nagan Singh - you see, very nice and dignified lady, and she is a Maharani, and all that - and we were rather late because our husbands didn't turn up. They're busy with their work. So she got very an-gry. She said, "Why did you come so late? After all, you see, if the husband had not come you could have come." Again I said, "We were waiting for our husbands who comes ear-lier." I was so, you see, annoyed. Mrs. Nagan Singh was just pinching Me. "See", she said that [laughing, unclear] You see, Mrs. Nagan Singh couldn't bear it. She said, "We are not going to have any tea because I think we can get better tea in our house without all this talking." And we got up and walked off, see. But she was so funny, and she started shouting at us. "Why did you come late?" So actually why did she invite us? She invited us for tea, to talk to us nicely, to be kind to us. Instead of that she was angry with us because we were late. Just imagine. So we can have tea in our own house. We didn't go to listen to her angry words. Isn't it? We just went to see her.

So this is what one should understand that Krishna's life was full of love. He didn't mind anything in love. Whatever sort it was, it is all love, and you see your Mother also. You know very well that I am very particular on neatness Myself, extremely neat Myself. In My house - it is a huge house you know, and you should see the photographs of My house sometimes, so you will know how I lived there - extremely neat. I'm very neat and tidy. But I never tell anybody else [unclear]. I Myself will go and clean My own things. Today in the bathroom it was all lying hotchpotch, and all that. I washed it Myself. I cleaned [immediately?]. I didn't tell anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone. Why should I hurt anyone? If I have to do, it I will do it. And even if they dirtied it, I never tell them that you should not dirty, you should not do like that. You see you should have that much sense that you should not hurt any one. Why are you cleaning the house? For whom? You are cleaning the house to make others happy. But cleaning for cleaning's sake has no sense. Why are you keeping the time? To keep others pleased. You are not doing it for time's sake. You are doing for pleasing others. But by that you are displeasing others, no use [being decent?]. No use doing this. I never grudge about anything - you have noticed. Despite the fact that I live in My own private way. I live in a very neat and clean way Myself. I'm very clean Myself. You see when I cook, I cook very well. But I see people cook in a very lethargic manner. If I take any [this?] work, I do it in such a meticulous way, so beautifully. I see to it that I do it proper. But people when I give them any work, they just started absolutely careless about it. They don't bother [Not clear]. You can't say.

So what I' m trying to tell you that it is better that you see yourself, that you look after what you want to do yourself. But don't spoil the heart of others. Don't injure others. Don't say things which are harsh. Forget it. Forget it as far as possible. Just try to forget. And this will help you a lot. Because this kind of a tension mounts up very well. And this is what Krishna hit in His life. He just wanted to crush the tension of people because of time, because of vidhi-nishedhas, because of funny ideas about religion. All this He wanted to kill. He said, "This doesn't exist in that area where I [reside?]."

So this is what one has to learn from His life that you should try to be yourself very neat and clean. You should try to be yourself very generous. You should try to be yourself do-ing all the work. You shouldn't say, "I was doing all this postering, and this fellow didn't do." So what? Who asked you to do it? You better not. If you think you are doing some-thing, you better not. But if you think you are doing for your pleasures, alright. If I am cooking, I just cook. I cook, I enjoy. I don't bother how much My servant has done or any body else has done. I do everything. If it comes to that, I wash, and clean, and sweep, and [unclear] do everything, if it has to be done. I am enjoying. Because you don't enjoy your work, you want others to do. "What he has done? They have not done. I have not done. So if I do, he will all not do. So I should not do." That's not the way. That means you don't enjoy the work of God. Any work. You can wash the floor, anything. Shri Krishna you know that He went and cleared the [asking something in Hindi to the audi-ence] left over food of the guests who were there. He cleaned all that. Cleaned all that. And just imagine in India only the sweepers or somebody like that do that [unclear] at the place of Yudhistira, Dharma Raj. At his place He went and did. So just imagine. Christ washed the feet of His disciples. So for them no work is higher lower. It is just what is enjoyed [everything?]. And everything is great for them.

You know that Shri Krishna's life is so full of such incidents that you can't imagine how far He has gone in showing that your position, your, what you call the money, the way you live has no meaning at all. Has no meaning at all. It is all absurd. And what is most important is that we should not hurt anyone. We should not trouble anyone. We should not try to injure anybody's feelings. On the contrary we should be extremely sweet. In a sweet manner you should do [things]. And that's how He judged. When He told some-body some work. And He could judge a person that what sort of a person he is. Immedi-ately He could judge that how deep the person is.

You see, with dedication, a little work... Like Rama's life... And we have seen Shabari took out every little berry, and tested it that it should not be sour. You see, like that they judged a person how sincere and devoted that person is. Little work do you do, how beau-tifully. And it comes out very well. If your devotion is alright, if you are absolutely posi-tive personality, it works out. But otherwise it will fizzle out. You'll do all kinds of mis-takes because the heart is not there. So the heart should be there. This is Shri Krishna's specialty that His heart was there. And in His heart resided Shiva. This time we had a puja in Vittala's place because I wanted to take. Now Shiva, it is always the Vittala went to Shiva. But this time Shiva had to go to Vittala. So that the people in their bhakti, in their behavior, in their everything should remember that they have to become the spirit. In Shri Krishna's bhakti they should know that Krishna did everything so that you should become the spirit. You should not be bound by gunas, by kala, by anything. But you should be free people. He just tried to free you from all these things. But He didn't want you to be people of frivolity. You could be frolic. But you cannot be frivolous people. And the frivolity and all that He just abandoned. But what He wanted you to get rid of all these bandhanas which were keeping you down.

I think we have had a nice time in this Holi, and we should always have such a nice time. Always with Shri Krishna's blessings you all should enjoy your Holi. But the greatest Holi is within yourself when you fill yourself with all kinds of colors. Your nature should be such that everybody should enjoy that color. That color that is within you, color of beauty - not artificial, just showing of, just giving something without any love. I tell you yesterday I went to the market just to buy some presents for you. And I just went, and ac-tually I was just with full heart, and I got exactly for the foreigners I had to buy 45 pieces. Exactly. And such sweet things that when you see that you are going to love it, just sweet things. I got and I just said, "See, it's my love. Just the idea that I have to give something to these people. How it has worked out." So we'll do that ceremony now of giving pre-sents to all the foreign people because Holi is the day you are supposed to give some pre-sents. Alright? So we have something for you to be given.

First we would like to give something to Rustom who has contributed substantially, very substantially his personal own money. I think nobody has contributed so much as Rustom has done. So give him a hand.

(Claps)

And the another person who has substantially contributed personal money is Warren. So give him a hand.

(Claps)

So just now we have to think of these two. But there are many who are coming up I must say (Gavin?) has decided to spare some money for the ashram, and also he was....

Vicky? Where is she? Vicky also is going to spare some money for the ashram of Eng-land. Let us see how it works out. But do it with full heart because it is not yet working out. There is something wrong somewhere, I think, that nothing materializing. So it is better to think about it what's gone wrong with it, and I'm sure it will work out.

There is another gentleman here. I don't know if he is here, the old gentleman who has donated, who has made a [will?] to donate money for Sahaja Yoga. There are many peo-ple who have donated money like that. But today I think we must give a hand to Mr. Venugopalan for doing the substantial work.

(Claps)

And for Subramanyam and Alan [claps] who have tried to do their level best to create this ashram. Now regarding this ashram I think I'll have to write down certain rules and regu-lations. Cannot be like Shri Krishna. Because I think people do not even have yet the re-sponsibility to understand that the ashram is a mandir, is a temple. And the way they be-have sometimes in a temple is surprising.

Another person who has to be given a special ovation is Yogi Mahajan. Because (Claps) he has substantially helped the whole thing. In such a way he has geared it up. And apart from that his idea about temple is absolutely correct how people should behave towards it. It should come from within yourself. This is your Mother's house and how you should behave. You should not talk loudly. You are entering into a temple, into a church. And you should respect it. When you come in, you must respect it. Even the outside of the thing should be touched on your forehead. It's a temple, and a temple of a living Mother who is here. So you must try to respect this temple. I see people throw away things here and there. No use getting angry with them. Because I think they have not yet realized that they are the saints, and they have to behave with the dignity of saints. So this, I would say that Yogi Mahajan has really played a very dynamic role in really gearing up Sahaja Yoga here. And our Mr. Varma Saab, [who?] I must say that he has been such a help to all of us.

(Claps)

You must thank him very much for one thing. And that is the greatest thing he has done - is to give you profits in your sari buying and things like that. [laughing and clapping] He has saved so much money for you.

Sahaja Yogi: Meticulous account...

Shri Mataji: Meticulous accounting and everything. Now you have got Rai Saab here who is working out your Nirmala Yog' magazine. And (Claps) now the postage side is increased, and I think they need to increase a little postage on that. So I think one pound more they want, is it? Normally? Three pounds more to be added because of the in-creased pricing and it was only three pounds. I think was ridiculous, six pounds is better. I think better make it seven pounds.

(Claps)

[Talk for duration 54.56 to 56.10 continued in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Now pound has come down.[talk in Hindi again]

Now I have seen the newsletters are good and they are doing well. But you see. But what you have to do that you should have a very good articles written, and edited, and all that. And don't give that headache to Me, you see. Like Bombay people did their own editing, and they published it. Only mistake the magazine made was the, where it was to be writ-ten for Jesus Christ they wrote it for somebody else. No. [talking in Hindi] In the bhakti (sangham?).

[Talk in Hindi]

They changed it. You see, So from... I don't know about whom it was. They changed the title. That's all. But all these little, little mistakes. But otherwise you see they did it all their own, and created a magazine out of it. You also can buy some magazine to do it.

Now your magaz. This is the seeds, you see, of all the seeds - like the water melons and pumpkins, the seeds of them are first of all soaked and dried. Now see the significance. It's so deep. We don't understand. We just make it traditionally. Why? What is Shri Krishna is the brain of the Virata. And for the brain what do you need is fat. And the fat of the seed is the best called magaz. It's called also magaz. Magaz also means "brain", and magaz also means the "seeds", the inside of the seed, the white of the seeds. Can you imagine? That's why it was made. Now you can imagine how deeply it was thought of Shri Krishna. But they'll put bhang in it just to neutralize the Holi festival.

(Shri Mataji speaking in Hindi)

It is no one can be compared with human being in their real sharp brains, how to put nose behind the...[audience laughing]

[Aaja ?]

Or I must thank also Dr. Mathur or Apne Dr. Saab. They are, both are looking on one side. They are looking after the university, and Dr. Nigam is looking after the, this is the, [Shri Mataji obviously puts Her attention to something] This is for the Devi. On a Holi day. Specialty is the half moon. Now I would suggest, we have to give a hand to both of them. Dr. Mathur for looking after the (unclear)...

(Claps)

...and Dr. Nigam looking after the (unclear)...

I would like also to say about Mr. Gupta who comes from beyond the river, who has done tremendous work [to us?].

(Claps)

And all the ladies, I should say. Because actually in India the ladies are in a potential way very helping. They are all working it out very well, and they are very potential. They do not come forward. So all the ladies who have helped Sahaja Yoga here to [unclear] ....

(Claps)

And all the young boys who did the publicity.

[talking in Hindi]

(Claps)

Of course, I've not left anybody. All the people who have helped Sahaja Yoga are in My heart. Every one of you I thank you very much.

[Talk for duration 1.00.53 to 1.01.33 continued in Hindi]

May God bless you.

(Claps)

Dr. Warren.

(Claps)

Look at these, so sweet. And coming to the, just look at these. How they are? Hmm, how sweet!

(Talk in Hindi)

I got exactly 45. [laughing and some Yogi is saying something]

She was quite surprised, you know, she went mad. We didn't know because some were big some were small. And so on. And she said, "Are you sure you want so many?" I said, "I want all of them but count." She said "They are 45." Just think of it. Exactly!

The children are enjoying.

(Talking in Hindi)

You don't get these - normally.

Ravin? Ravin.

(Claps)

Now all the men should come first. One by one. [Hindi] All the men from the foreign countries.

That's too much.

Sahaja Yogi: "Mother, some of Your children asked me to get You a present specially to do with Shri Krishna."

Shri Mataji: You are all very clever people.

(Claps and laughing)

Sahaja Yogi: "It's a [prayer?] that we should all have detachment, so that we just witness our problems and enjoy Your leela."

Shri Mataji: Ha. [applause]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] buying such an expensive thing for Me?

(Sahaja Yogi says something)

Shri Mataji: Oh, it's too much. You know I don't wear all that. And it's too much for you to spend.

(Sahaja Yogi says something)

Shri Mataji: I don't know how you open this, is very subtle. You have to open it, or you can wear it like that? May not fit Me?

(Talk in Hindi)

You all should come one by one. All the people.

(Talk in Hindi)

Shri Mataji: I've touched all of them.

(Talk in Hindi)

Shri Mataji: ...on a [mass scale?]. Shri Mataji: May God Bless You.

(Ongoing Clapping)

Shri Mataji: Madhurya, just see the madhurya of Shri Krishna. It's on your lap. Not Mine. It's your lap. You see. May God bless you. May God bless you all. Some of them are not painted, but you can take them.

(Talk in Hindi)

[Ongoing clapping]

Shri Mataji: Now the ladies should come after this.

(Sahaja Yogi says something)

Shri Mataji: You have counted [it? everything?]. Come along.

(Talk in Hindi)

Shri Mataji: Is it a colored one? Take a colored one. Is better for [him? you?].

(Talk in Hindi)

Shri Mataji: I hope there are 45 people.

(Sahaja Yogi says something)

Shri Mataji: How many there are? I didn't count Dev. Dev has come.

(Sahaja Yogi says something)

Shri Mataji: Three more. We have three Ganeshas.

Sahaja Yogi: [...]I'm taken another one for [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Sahaja Yogi: I'm taken another one for [unclear]. He's sick.

Shri Mataji: Alright. I will give you something else for him. Alright? Because we have to see if [he is coming??] Alright? Who are the three people? Raise your hands.

Sahaja Yogi: Robin...
