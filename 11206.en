1984-0506 1: Talk, Care of Children, Keep Sahasrara Open, Artists

Gregoire: ls there a particular advice to keep the Sahasrara open and clear?

Shri Mataji: Particular?

Gregoire: ls there a particular advice to keep the Sahasrara open?

Shri Mataji: Alright, I’ll answer this also.

Gregoire: (After translating in French) …She will answer this question when She will talk.

Shri Mataji: No, I can answer this question now. It’s very simple, as I have told you, that the deity of Sahasrara is sitting before you… that the deity of Sahasrara is the Mahamaya… that try not to understand Her through your reasoning and imagination but by surrendering absolutely to it you keep your Sahasrara open. In case you still find it is still closed, you have to ask forgiveness from the deity that “if we have by mistake… made any mistakes, so please forgive us” that’s all.

Alright, now what is the another question?

Gregoire: It’s a very specific question. It is advised that children should sleep in the same room as the parents that if they wake up four, five times during the night, is it possible to put them in a separate room?

Shri Mataji: No no, then the mother should sleep to the child and the father should sleep in another room. Mother should never leave the child. Moreover I would advise you that now you have children, don’t get too much involved with your children, that’s a dangerous thing. This is another phase. First they get involved with their wives or husbands, then they get involved with their children. If you get involved with the children, then again you have to restart many things. So don’t get involved, you have to just do the work like a trustee of the child, just a trustee of the child, but don’t get involved with the child, that is My job, you have to leave it to me. So don’t get too much involved with the children. I find people who got children, you see, are going now writing literature on it. Don’t do like that. I have already given instruction what is to be done about the child, that the children are Mine, not yours. So you just don’t get involved into them because that’s a temptation for you. Too much involvement in the children is a sign of degradation. It’s only your responsibility to look after it, that’s all.

And mother must be with children, must “be” with children. She should sleep with them, she should look after them till they are five years of age. If they have to go out, she must know that she has to carry the child. She cannot leave children, that’s not good. Should never leave the child before they are five years of age, whatever is there. Because women should know that till that age, five years of age the child is growing very fast. You see at an old age say, somebody is ninety and ninety five there is not much difference. And at that time the sense of security must be maintained. That one has to do. So if the husband has to do something else or if he has to go out or anything, he can go with other friends… aah… the boys, or other Sahaja Yogis, but the mother must look after the children, that’s her duty, she has to do it. And of course the husband must help her, must do whatever is needed, but here the question is of shifting the similarity. Now at this time the mother is important, she has to look after the child. That’s her first job. And at this time the husband’s job becomes a secondary thing. But hers is a first job and later on then it again shifts, because husbands work becomes more important. If you give them now the security [inaudible], the children you will find will be very peaceful and that’s what Indians do. You have seen how Indian children behave, they are so quiet, so peaceful because completely the mothers forget about the whole world. You will be surprised, till My younger daughter was five years of age, I never went out with My husband.

And women should not unduly feel that to look after the child is a lower job and to work in the office is a higher job because that pays more money or gives you artificial powers. You must know the greatest power in this world is that of the mother and unless and until give you that first to your child, the child is not going to give you back that discipline, that respect, that [glory?] that you expect as parents.

There should be a report between the child and the parents and understanding, they should talk and not give toys all the time but talk. Even when they don’t talk you talk to them and that will improve cases.

So what is the second question?

Gregoire: Can You talk about discrimination Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: It’s an innate quality, you can’t talk about it. Discrimination is not rational. It’s an innate quality but the best thing you have are vibrations by which you should see if the things are alright or not. But you must know as Sahaja Yogis as you will grow you will know immediately what is good and what is bad. It’s a state in which you just… you become discrete. But for that you must know is to have your responses controlled, a steady response. Do anything. You just for example you see something for a minute you just become into thoughtless awareness. Then you will have the power of discretion. Is a power it is not a thing that can discussed or thought, is a power.

So one has to develop that state and the best is to at any confrontation anything that you face first you become thoughtlessly aware so you enter into the Kingdom of God and then react. The responses must be made very steady and subtle and one should not suddenly change the attentions just now, now [sound of fingers snaping] everybody’s attention there… Mine is not. I did the job

Gregoire: Once again.

Shri Mataji: Alright? The attention now is with Me, suddenly all of you turn. What is there to see? Who is responsible? So those who put their attention there pull your ears [Mother is laughing]. I think everybody should do it [Sahaja Yogis are laughing]. Alright… so… now… what’s the other question?

Gregoire: How an artist who is a Sahaja Yogi what means to create a piece of art?

Shri Mataji: The piece of art must emit vibrations. If it does not emit that means there is something wrong. And going for something higher subjects like Kundalini, like the expression of Kundalini the colours of Kundalini and intrudes another world, you have to move into that world like you can see we have so many artists for example you can say Blake. And for a Sahaja Yogi it should be a kind of a beautiful integration of the gross and the abstract or realistic and abstract you can say and little bit of impressionism. That’s how you should try to integrate all of them. They express one style, Sahaja Yogi has his own style, because he knows how to mix them, how to integrate. But certain colours like black should be avoided. But the pastel colours if they are mixed with black give it a depth to the pastel colours.

Now, your Mothers attention goes to Sahaja Yogis, that’s My attention is. And it is such a remarkable attention that it is described “Kataksha, Kataksha, Nireekshana”, means every glance examines and acts so then you have that attention then it’s alright to see everything, because it so deep and penetrating.

Gregoire: Some people for reason or another cannot live in an Ashram, so how do such people know that they are growing in collectivity?

Shri Mataji: Growth in collectivity creates joy, fun, happiness no discussion no argument comes in. Specially with the leader, how worth are your relations, that’s very important. Now if you fight with the leader there is something wrong with you. You have no right to fight him, the leader. Now if the leader becomes absolutely unpopular, then he is no more a leader that I know. But he has to be unpopular in the whole world. Say for example if there is Mr. “X” who is popular in the country, who is a leader and unpopular in a country “Y”. Now that is no judgement because they might be jealous. They think they are equal to him and stand fighting back and can chat him down. And no administration can work like that. Least of all divine administration.

So those who fight the leader are first of all uncollective. Actually India is the best way to find out. They come and tell Me about who is who. So I would put it like this very grossly that you have to be popular in India. And the Indian leaders have to be popular otherwise, in other countries. But perhaps I have some sense of discretion and I know who is who. So somebody who is a leader you should not fight - first of all. You should not, aah…, if he is strict, if he is harsh with you take it with a grace and be happy that you are collective. But if you give an explanation, or you fight it back, or you think that you are alright then you can never improve. I have seen there are some Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis who are being with us for years and they have not improved at all because they think that there’s nothing wrong with them. Sometimes I shout at them because the bhoots have to go, so they had said “alright, Mother has shout at our bhoots”. And they never want to look at themselves. And they are the looser who is going to lose. They are stupid. And then such people go and talk against the leader at his back, these are the murmuring souls that Christ has described. And they try to form a group against the leader and create a problem, a barrier for themselves and also for Sahaja Yoga. These are very dangerous people and they know the ways how to talk against the leader. So keep away from them and shut them down. Even they might be your husband, or your wife, or your child, don’t listen, tell them to shut up. This is a bhoot talking. Just don’t listen to anyone who murmurs behind the back of the leader. They will appear to be very wise, very sensible, but know that they are against Sahaja Yoga. Just don’t listen to them, don’t accept anything from them, tell them to shut up.

The leader has to deal with very important things, with Me is very difficult to deal, and he has to also deal with petty things. They, poor things are like martyrs, I should say, in My presence. I had to correct them so many times in such a bold manner, I correct them and they take it from Me.

This is how we are going to work it out very smoothly.

1984-0506 2: Talk in English with French Translation

Gregoire: Yes Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: One must understand, that it is the leaders who have to be really strict with the discipline. They themselves should be disciplined and they must put discipline on the people, but they have to be compassion, full of compassion, compassionate towards all other people, but not sympathetic towards bhoots. Not to sympathise with bhoots, not to identify with bhootish nonsense, not to be kind to people who have bhoots is discipline, is the compassionate discipline. That’s how we all are going to improve and improve and improve for our own being.

Now here there is no domination; is the compassion of God you accept and the bhoots you discard, the domination of the bhoots you discard with help of your leaders. So if they are harsh with you thank them for that. Next question.

Sahaja yogini: [Question is not audible]

Shri Mataji: They are sadly mistaken. Thus if they do that, they will be lost in no time. This is the same thing which has ruined our western country where people believed in individuality without maturity. We believe in maturity and then individuality. Say a flower becomes a fruit. On the tree it has to mature, on the tree with the whole till it is completely matured and then it can become an individual, otherwise what’s the use in having these half-baked people. He must know that in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in an immature individuality. Like two little boys of ten years fighting in front of My road, having a boxing. I asked them “Why are you fighting?”. They tell me back “It’s a personality clash”.

Alright now…, what’s the next question?

Sahaja yogi: [Question not audible]

Gregoire repeats the question: The question is if there is one leader who does not stand up to his responsibility…

Shri Mataji: That’s mine look out, that’s mine look out. You know, I know everything, so you just don’t worry. You don’t have to judge your leaders, leave it to me, I will manage them. See now already have so much work to judge yourself and to judge those who are not yet realised so why should you worry about your leaders so much?

Sahaja yogi: Is Shri Krishna born from a cow?

Shri Mataji: [Mother and yogis are laughing shortly] Now, there once upon a time long, long time back, the Mother took birth as a cow. See? And everybody was in that cow.  Krishna and every one was in that cow. Then later on that cow took the form of a lady a then Krishna was born from that lady, from her children.

Now any other questions?

Sahaja yogi: If you are in Sahaja Yoga and your wife leaves you, or your family leaves you how do you react?

Shri Mataji: I am just the same! [Long applause follows]. Now fourteen years have passed, it’s just the same and only thing you can do is to prove it. Prove it by your own behaviour, by your own example. If they are honest they will accept it, if they are dishonest forget them. This so called family is temporary, this is the eternal family you have. So don’t quarrel or fight with them, leave them alone, they will come around. Actually you should never force them to come.

I give another instruction today that many people who are Sahaja Yogis won’t take their children to their parents, because according to them they are not Sahaja Yogis, sometimes they don’t take their children because they think their parents will spoil them. Unless and until they are positively against Sahaja Yoga, if they are not against Sahaja Yoga you should take your children there, there is no harm. Because this is a very funny attitude people take. But if they are definitely against Sahaja Yoga, doing activities against Sahaja Yoga then you cut them. But as long as they are neutral they are not doing any harm to Sahaja Yoga, they are not against Sahaja Yoga, they are not against you, then there is no harm in going and seeing the children.

I mean that Sahaja Yogis are so frightened of bad vibrations that they look like schizophrenic people. It should not be of craze, Sahaja Yoga is not the craze. It is a power that should give you greater power instead of making you frightened personalities. You are not excluded people, excluded from the rest of them. You are not excluded. You are exclusive, but not excluded. This is discretion again. So go ahead with it. Meet everyone, talk to everyone, be nice to everyone, go to every shop, go to your parents, talked to then nicely, be nice, don’t talk about Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise you will develop some horns [Mother laughs].

So this is “to feel everybody’s vibrations, bad vibrations, good vibrations” madness.

And a fellow who came to see me, he is a Freudian and he wrote in his book that Sahaja Yogis are schizophrenic..., Yeah he did. There is one fellow in India a stupid fellow. And you see, he must have picked up some Sahaja Yogis from the periphery, you see, who are frightened to talk to “you are Freudian, [not clear] I don't want to see your face”. Why should be afraid of anyone? Even of the satan. Who is he? You are there to kill Him and you have powers. So what is this kind of a cowardliness? Doesn't behove.

Gregoire rejoicingly and powerfully: Bolo Shri Jaganmata Adi Shakti Shri Nirmala Devi ki!!!

Sahaja Yogis rejoicingly and powerfully: JaaayyyYYYY

Gregoire rejoicingly and powerfully: Shri Nirmala Devi ki!!!

Sahaja Yogis rejoicingly and powerfully: JaaayyyYYYY

Gregoire rejoicingly and powerfully: Shri Nirmala Devi ki!!!

Sahaja Yogis rejoicingly and powerfully: JaaayyyYYYY

Shri Mataji: All right. Next question.

Editorial: Sahaja Yogis are now expressing their Joy with rejoicing and long applause.

Shri Mataji: Actually you have such powers that even if you do like this, the bhoots will run away. “Like THIS”! Is sufficient. Now what is it?

Gregoire: This we haven't registered.

Shri Mataji: Yes, because they said there is not good vibrations in the thing. I'm coming here, how dare anybody stay here. They must have run away at least hundred miles. [Mother is saying this while laughing and it is followed by joyful laughing, blowing conch horns and long applause of all Sahaja Yogis].

Shri Mataji: So now, let's have it, the second question. Now what is it?

Sahaja yogi: Mother, how can we please you best?

Gregoire: It's not a bad question Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Gregoire: How can we please you best?

Shri Mataji: I have no desires. I don't know [Sahaja Yogis are joyfully laughing and applauding]. You see, inside Me is complete peace and complete satisfaction. There is nothing that is needed inside. But the ripples of that joy flows outward all the time. And when it reaches your shores, you see, it comes back. And it weaves a beautiful pattern, and I see the pattern. The reciprocity, how much you reciprocate, is the way the pattern is beautiful. It's delicate, it's powerful. It's so soothing and it weaves the complete beauty of bhakti. So much so that this ocean of joy itself gets turbulent, and I really swing with it. And it is not easy to describe that beautiful feeling of tremendous joy. The first thing you have to know that I love you very much, with all My heart, with all My soul. In the same way try to love Me with all sincerity and trust.

May God bless you all!

Now I speak for one minute about this meditation. Yesterday I told you about putting your attention to different areas, the pradesh or the chakras. And the chakras, as you know, have got mandalas, is the areas. So when you pay attention to the chakras, where do you pay attention to, is the point. Actually you pay attention to the deity. Now this deity, supposing you are taking the name of Shri Ram. You are trying to establish Shri Ram within your heart, right Heart Chakra. Now at that time what do you do? You say the mantra.

But there's another way which is easier. Because you are saying a mantra in a way that is not so much intelligible there to Shri Ram. But first of all if you study the qualities of Shri Ram. What were his qualities? And if you manifest those qualities through your character, then it's very easy to please Shri Ram. What is the quality of Shri Ganesh? He's entirely surrendered to Mother, even Father doesn't bother Him. What is the quality of Christ? He forgives those who have crucified Him. He can go through all kinds of tapas. What is the quality of Shri Krishna? For whom everything is a leela.

Like that, when you take the name of Shri Krishna, do you see everything as a witness? If effortlessly that happens to you, you should know that you have established Shri Krishna. Is the most difficult thing is to establish Me. Because I'm Mahamaya. And the facets are so many, sixteen thousand…, into…, raised to power one thousand.

So it's difficult. But whatever things you can grasp and think this is Mother's quality, try to imbibe that within yourself. That doesn't mean you start shouting at bhoots first.

So first, what is the first quality of Mother? That She came on this earth and She has worked for people who are nowhere near Her.

She stooped down to elevate. And then gradually you can understand that this quality will take you to higher qualities that you think. So among the seven colors to begin with, I am the green color. Because I'm in the center. Green color is the color that you get it from the Mother Earth. So first you must establish the quality of the Mother Earth: that she sucks up all the problems, gives you the best that she has. Start with the Mother Earth so you start with the Kundalini.

That's how one should start imbibing. The pure Kundalini form of Mother is purity, is cleansing purity. But are you pure? Are you pure in your heart? Just think of that. And then, with purity you start. That is how you have to establish different chakras, of purifying all the chakras and ultimately when you have purified all of them, you have established Me.
