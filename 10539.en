TV Interview
October 21st, 1982
Plymouth, UK

Her followers see Her as a great spiritual leader, capable of curing all ills, even cancer. Well, these are the sort of claims you’ve probably heard before from many so-called gurus, but for Her fast expanding group of disciples Mataji Nirmala Devi is different. Tonight She brings Her message to a public meeting in Exeter.

REPORTER: Mataji, the world of healing and gurus is full of frauds and charlatans. Do you accept that many people might be skeptical about Your claims?
SHRI MATAJI: Of course they should be. Why they are not I don’t understand, you see. You must use your brains and reach right conclusions. Why are you seeking, what are you seeking and whom are you going to. Those people who charge you money and live like parasites on you cannot be your gurus, you see, they are people without any self-respect.
REPORTER: You don’t charge any money at all?
SHRI MATAJI: Not at all. I mean, how can I charge money for this, is Love, Love of God. How can I charge money for that?
REPORTER: It’s claimed that even viewers of an interview such as this just by looking at Your picture on the television screen can receive some sort of physical manifestation of Your power. Now, how does that work?
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. By, just if they put their hands towards Me like this even now, they can feel a cool breeze flowing into their hands. So many might feel, as they felt it in Hong Kong, but if you are complicated people, it’s… takes some time. But normally people are simple and they get it, the cool breeze just starts blowing into their hands. And that is the breeze of the Holy Ghost.
REPORTER: Just by holding their hands to the screen at the moment?
SHRI MATAJI: Just like this. Just like that, yes.
REPORTER: Well, Your message is self-awareness, self-realism, I mean, what exactly does that mean?
SHRI MATAJI: Self is the reflection of God Almighty in our… in the heart. But it resides on top of your head. And what is self-realization in ordinary words you can say, the real baptism. Is the real baptism. Means what happens, that your Spirit enters into your awareness, into your conscious mind, into your central nervous system, so that you start feeling the awareness of the Spirit, which is flowing through you as energy. This is the energy of the all-pervading Power of God.
REPORTER: But I’m sure many people must feel that they know themselves perfectly well already, without any extra power required.
SHRI MATAJI: This is a self-opinionated thing. But there is a way to find out if you know yourself, then you must know what are the centres catching in you, what are the centres are catching in another person. It is the becoming that is important, it’s not a mental projection that “I’m such and such.” Supposing I say I’m the governor of some place. Do I become? No. I must have the powers.
REPORTER: And You can actually look at another person and say what is wrong with that person, or feel what is wrong with that person?
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I can, I can look at the person and say, but others, those who are Sahaja Yogis, can just feel it on their fingertips. But we talk another language, we don’t say “You have cancer,” because that’s not good to say. But what we say,“You are catching on this centre or that centre.” Supposing somebody is very egoistical. Then we don’t say “You are egoistical,” we say “You are catching on Agnya,” so he doesn’t feel hurt, you know.
REPORTER: But having identified the problems you can also cure them as well.
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. If we identify the problems, we also know how to cure them.
REPORTER: What happened twenty years ago, before gurus even were heard of in the Western world? We seemed to survive perfectly well without them.
SHRI MATAJI: You see, this is the time of resurrection, this is the time of Last Judgment. It’s been pointed out by your great poet William Blake, who said that a new category of human beings, he called them Men of God, will be born on this earth, and they will become prophets, and they will have powers to make others prophets. Of course there has been prophecy also in India thousands of years back, that in… this work will start in 1970 and that many people will get their realization. Is already announced.
REPORTER: And now we are in that time.
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, that the time has come, that’s why these people have taken birth. And there are many children who are born realized, and you do not know what they are, because they have these vibrations and they are different people.
REPORTER: Mataji, thank you very much indeed.
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you.
