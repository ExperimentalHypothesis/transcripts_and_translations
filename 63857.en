[Shri Mataji dictates a letter]

Should I start?
So my dear saints, whatever it is, we are a group of people who have assembled together through our true seeking and all of us have been to all kinds of various gurus and various acts of seeking, because we were anxiously seeking the truth.

In our seeking, we had to go through all the ancient scriptures, not only Indian, but also other scriptures like Koran and Torah and the Bible. We have read also the Indian scriptures with very great care. Some of them have read some books and some others have read some others. But, we would like to point out that Kundalini awakening is to be understood in its all seriousness and in its all true, real form. The Vedas, which are four, Upanishads, Darshanas, Puranas, [unclear- 3:20] and Tantra Vidyanas, all of them point out that Kundalini, even Gita, - Gita you put it, note it Gita- that Kundalini is the primule or the germinating power within us, which gives us Realisation, which is the evolutionary manifestation of human beings. All other things, which people talk about will not lead to evolution, but they may develop some powers which are supra-conscious in nature or subconscious.

We have met eight disciples at least of your guru Mr. Yaar. We would like to tell you that only one person was a Realised soul, which was a born-realised, and has been utilised by your guru, as his own disciple, while your guru himself is not a self-realised being? You may ask, "How do we say this with such authenticity?" But we would like to, very humbly, inform you that we got Self-realisation through the grace of HH Mataji Nirmala Devi and that we have the vibrations - into brackets (Chaitanya Lahari described by Adi Shankaracharya) supported by all these great scriptures, by which we can know if a person is Realised or not. Not only that, but we can cure people [who are] mentally, physically and emotionally disturbed.

Apart from that, we can raise the Kundalini and show you how it rises with your naked eyes. And also can grant Self-realisation. It is a fantastic statement, but it is so. We do not claim ourselves to be the master gurus, as your guru does, without Self-realisation. But there are 300 of us, Western Sahaja Yogis in London, and there are thousands all over the world. We can perform Kundalini awakening by the grace of Mataji Nirmala Devi, and we have seen that she has given mass Realisation to thousands of people.

I would say the test of a guru is that a genuine Guru bestow all his powers to his disciples. He does not expect anything in return, but gives all his powers to his disciples and does not take a credit of something that he has not done. Because a one disciple, if he is a born-realised, Mataji immediately tells that person that, "You are a born-realised". And then she teaches that person how to use that vibratory awareness which she has got it. She establishes him in his awareness and his Self-realisation and gives all the information needed how to manoeuvre, work out, and respect the power that he has got.

Apart from that, her exposition of Sahaja Yoga has completely shown the integration of all the incarnations, whether it was Christ, Muhammad or Guru Nanak, whether it was Rama, Krishna or Mary, Mother of Jesus, or Fatima. She has given meaning to all that was historically accepted as great religions, denied nothing. And she has shown a complete understanding, co-relationship, and the bearing of all these happenings which were called as miracles. As if in a dark room the light has appeared. And we have been able to verify all this through our vibratory awareness.

For your information, you are also not a self-realised soul but you call yourself ‘saved’, you are free to do that. But you have no vibratory awareness. When we asked some of the disciples of Mr. Yaar, to tell where our Kundalini was they could not tell. But we could tell them that it is all frozen in different places. We could tell them what chakras were caught, and what diseases they had. Of course, we do not have their names. But if you find out, I think they came just to disturb Mataji's lectures, and ask foolish questions and to dominate the scene. This is not a sign of a saint.

If you really, if you are a real seeker or anybody who is a seeker, should try to come and attend our programmes which are absolutely free, without any obligation, and should not try to disturb. On the contrary, should not try to disturb us. In Caxton Hall, She has a programme every week on Monday.

But if you are a real seeker, you will come. Of course, to our amazement we have found out that many are soiled and spoiled by brainwashing of many gurus who call themselves incarnations and call themselves as masters. There are many like that. And there are so many of them are ruined because they have been to wrong people and their actually kundalinis have been frozen down.

It is - it should not be surprising for you, that few people turn up. It is never surprising to us if few people turn up to our Sahaja Yoga programmes. Because it is a reality in which a person is transformed and has to adhere to his transformation with a little discipline. It is not a toothbrush selling organisation, where an advertisement says that, "This is the cure for all your ailments". But Kundalini is the only thing that does it, no doubt. But we have not met even a single person who has given the powers that Mataji has given us. 

Apart from that, she has given us the complete knowledge of Kundalini and all its awakening and all its this thing, without keeping any secrets about it. It's all freely available to you. If you want you can come along, not to quarrel and fight, but to really receive what is Self-realisation, which is the place in the Kingdom of God, where one enjoys the bliss and joy.

The Collective Consciousness, which is established in the Sahaja Yoga is called as, samuhik chetana, in the in the scriptures.This Collective Consciousness is manifested as if we are like a like a built-in computer and suddenly we are connected with the mains. The whole thing starts working and a rapport is established and the communication takes place. Chaitanya Lahari is the book, at least, to be read by anybody who talks about Kundalini. If you have not even read that book then don't depend on Mr Yaar your Guru the great, who is not a guru because he's not higher than you, at least not than us.

Hmm?
[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: ... told me the three things that he wants to have. First, he said is the introduction.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes this is, that's a different one. This is another one that we tried to organize a while ago, I don't know if you remember.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Organize?
Sahaja Yogi: Open door.
Sahaja Yogi: A while ago where you're allowed to have your own program.

Shri Mataji: Now I’ll tell you one thing, very simple thing is Rommel (Rommel Varma, Shri Mataji's son-in-law) is a great photographer, all right? Now what we can do, we can make a very dramatic thing with that. And we can use it. And he- we have got a film making camera also. So, we can take a film. We can just buy, we have to just buy a film and we take films and things. And we have to give some things like that and the film will be ready. And I ask Rommel to do that for me. Within 8 days we can prepare a film.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. This one.
Shri Mataji: So, there won't be much problem, you see. In that film, we can use some of the photographs. And you enlarge them and use them showing how she does it. I need not be, personally be there, but you can show my photograph.
Sahaja Yogi: The thing is that we have to be accepted which um...
Shri Mataji: If you say, tell them-
Sahaja Yogi: ..I spoke to them. We've already sent in something and they'll be considering all the things that they have in about a week and a half's time. I spoke to them very recently and they said that, if we wanted to send in more detailed information about ourselves, they could have to consider, to look at when they consider the thing. So, I was thinking we could send in more detail.
Shri Mataji: You sent the detail, all right.
Sahaja Yogi: Because we just sent a small form see something I don't know if we remember when you-
Shri Mataji: You do that but you should say that, "We have, instead of making any program, we already have a film on it which you can show". It's much simpler.

Sahaja Yogi: Well, no, no. We're allowed, you see, we're allowed to have air time, completely ourselves.
Shri Mataji: Yes, so we can show film then.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Instead of we can arrange it much better. You see, we can make it much more interesting. You can say Gods, Goddesses we can show Ganesha.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. We can put-
Shri Mataji: You see -
Sahaja Yogi: That can be used.
Shri Mataji: That will be very good. I can write a script for it. How many minutes?
Sahaja Yogi: I think it's about half an hour.
Shri Mataji: Good. You can put my tapes also in between. You see, we can have that -
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but the thing is, we have to write to them just to give them more information. So, we can have the programme.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Tell them that, "You let us know, we'll need at least a month to prepare it. Because we are going to give you a complete film so you won't have any headache".

Sahaja Yogi: We need to give them more information about Sahaja Yoga at the moment so that if they –
Shri Mataji: Yes, that is true. But –
Sahaja Yogi: Yes so would you like to say anything.
Shri Mataji: About that?
Sahaja Yogi: If you want to. I mean I'm quite happy to go ahead myself.
Shri Mataji: I think Gavin can do. Both of you put together, you can do it, you see, you can tell them. But these are the points to be stressed you see. That, "We have found it, you see, by this". I have not put addiction, illness. Addiction, you can put it. "You get cured of addictions and imbalances".
You can put it yourself, I mean, it’s so much great that...

Sahaja Yogi: These false gurus and things, can they are not been put aside?
Shri Mataji: Yes?

Child: How do you do?
Shri Mataji: How do you do? Beautiful.
What happened?
Sahaja Yogi: Well I don't know. I just think I some of these like these fake gurus and that, they get so many people. I wonder why they come.
Shri Mataji: They are coming out the subconscious.
To someone: Just have vibrated. Will you have this also? Would you like this? So, it’s good, it’s good. But liver, that's why I was wondering whether I should give you, it’s very bad for the liver. Better not, because it has got a lot of oil in it. It's like-
Sahaja Yogi [to the child]: How you do?
Child: Nani, nani.

Shri Mataji: So, what would you like me to tell?

Sahaja Yogi: Can't they be put away? Can't they be destroyed?

Shri Mataji: Destruction has no meaning, you know.
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: Destruction has no meaning. They go into the subconscious. They have to go to Hell. Then you have to give them chances.
Sahaja Yogi: The Rakshasas have to have a chance?
Shri Mataji: Everybody has to be given a full chance. Thirdly, [when] you destroy someone. For example, one case.There was one gentleman, known as [unclear] Maharaj. And he died. When he died, he got lots of these spirits which entered into his disciples and they really became mad. I mean there's no chance for them, no chance of saving these people.
Sahaja Yogi: So, he has died.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogi: So, that fake guru died.
Shri Mataji: And he got lots of spirits, you see, around him from the subconscious. And all his disciples have become like mad people. Now there's no chance for saving them at all. Because they can just finish off your brains. So, I want to make them, little bit assured, and gradually remove them so that your brains are intact.

I have sent a letter from South Africa. I have a disciple there, but he was a split personality when he came to me. And I treated him, he got all right. I said, "I wanted to know the name of your guru". But he said "There are thousands here.
Sahaja Yogi: In South Africa as well.
Shri Mataji: And like that and you write, send him all the booklet and everything that we have. All the things that we have and all the information. He said, "I cannot get vibrations". Tell him how to do it. He wants some Kumkum. You can send him some Kumkum also.
Sahaja Yogi: We'll take his address.
Shri Mataji: No, address is with her. And I've sent the letter with Rustom. "And also for your aarti" he asked for [unclear]. I’ll be giving it to someone definitely. For Rustom only.

So, this is it. Now you’re- about Sahaja Yoga, now you know so many but the points that have to be stressed out. Very good in that small little pamphlet that you have, which Gavin has printed. 
Sahaja Yogi: Will you make this [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: What, what do you mean the one?
Sahaja Yogi: This one, "I have done Sahaja Yoga after Self-realisation..."
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: Excellent.

Shri Mataji: But you not say after Self-relation, you can use that.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: And also, the first half another that is, then what must we say or something like that.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh yes. "Because we have to tell you..."
Shri Mataji: These two, this you give them. They are very good ones.
Sahaja Yogi: Just give this out to all people.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: We also, do you know that we give this out.

Shri Mataji: This you give.
Sahaja Yogi: Can we give this out?
Shri Mataji: No you need not give to them.
Sahaja Yogi: To who? Newcomers?
Shri Mataji: To newcomers you can, but [only] to realised people.

Two hundred pounds like this. These are not said about masse Realisation. Why masse Realisation takes place, how masse Realisation takes place is the point. That's the point which –
Sahaja Yogi: Why does it happen, because all the people's kundalini's jump towards you.
Shri Mataji: Yes, why? So, this is a question which we can answer also. That's all you should say.

People will say that, "How is it so easy? So you can say, "There must be something about Mataji. We should know what she is. And that’s mentioned about her in the scriptures."

I mean, it's so clear cut. There's nothing to fear. I mean, it's already given that you'll have vibrations, you'll have cool breeze. Every scripture has said it.

Sahaja Yogi: In the in the Bible, in the Apocalypse, as it is called, the Revelation of John.
Shri Mataji: It is given there that the cool breeze will be coming. Also they have described another woman who will be satanic.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, he does do that.
Shri Mataji: You see, this woman, that they have described, is a collective satanic woman, which actually describes the men and gurus who use sex. You see, this woman is that, is the collective, all the satanic gurus and things like that. Scarlet, scarlet colour. Scarlet colour means blood that has, I mean frozen blood. People with frozen blood, these gurus which have been described. And she has to save her children from a dragon. These are these gurus. The Bible is very symbolic.

Sahaja Yogi: It also says in the Bible that the lady appears with the sun and the moon has to go away,
Shri Mataji: That’s very true.
Sahaja Yogi: For a while.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's very true, yes.
Sahaja Yogi: But you don't have to go away, do you?
Shri Mataji: I have to.
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: I have to go away, no doubt. I have to go away, you see. Otherwise, how can these people be brought in?
Sahaja Yogi: What? Pass away, you mean.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Yes, I have to pass away.

Sahaja Yogi: Before, it’s all fulfilled.
Shri Mataji: Of course, before the Kalki comes in, I have to leave. That is far off. I have to go. I can go to my own place up there. I don't go anywhere. But it will be a Kalki form. It can be possible that I transform myself into Kalki. I can take a man’s form. So, of course I have to go,
Sahaja Yogi: So we won’t see the fruition of Satya Yuga?
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course, I am seeing it already. What is the sign of Satya Yuga?
Sahaja Yogi: En-masse Realisation.
Shri Mataji: When the Shri Chakra has come down what more the Satya yuga is? When you are already feeling the vibrations!
Sahaja Yogi: But when all the people in the world, and there's no more catching...
Shri Mataji: Yes. That is now. Satya Yuga has started. That is, just now, not yet the epitome of it. But already started.

(Mother's grandson Anand is crying in background)

He’s trying to come, just [Unclear]
You see, he's so loving, he doesn't want to live without me.
Bring him along. Just bring him in your hand.

Baba, don’t scold him. You don't know how much he worked hard. He is my love. [Shri Mataji kisses the child.]

Close the door. Poor fellow has worked so hard. She is saying he was pressing everybody's neck and pulling everybody's nose. So, she's angry with him. I said, "That was necessary". She doesn't understand.
He is tired. He feels so frustrated after he's done so good.

Would you like another?

In the end, you can say that, "You may ask why, how is it, that Mataji is giving en-masse Realisation".

So, you can you can say that, "For answering this question, I think you’d better come and see us".

Sahaja Yogi: Can the whole process be speeded up?
Shri Mataji: Hum? I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry, I shall see.
Sahaja Yogi: Can the whole process of getting people Realised be speeded up if we work harder and harder? Does it depend upon us working harder?
Shri Mataji: You must clear yourself. You see, what happens, you go one step forward, then you come down. You see, this is the problem. At least, now, don't doubt anything. Now you are not doubting anything. But now don't think, you see, once you just somehow or other, go forward with it, then it will help me very much. In India, you see, one man has done such a wonderful thing, that he's established at least 10 centres and thousands of disciples.
You see, it depends on you people. You are the leaders, you see, I'm not. I have no desires, you know I'm desireless. You have to pray. You have to ask for boons. You should say, "Mother, we must have Sahaja Yoga established. We must have Satya Yuga done in your presence." All these things you ask from me. Just ask from me. This is a boon you must ask.
Sahaja Yogi: Can we ask it now?
Shri Mataji: Yes, ask it everything. Also, you should ask that, "Mother, grant us a place where we can live and that we want you to be happy to see us grow". And, "In this country, you should become recognized by most of the people". Like that, you ask me. I have no desires.

Come along, Vije.
(Hindi conversation with her grandchildren)

Cooly just come here!

This question of actualisation, getting your own powers, and relationship with other scriptures and every scripture and integration; all these points are there, lots of these.
All scriptures are explained through vibratory awareness. You see, that's the thing you must stress, is the vibratory awareness.

You can also put a point like this that, "Even her authenticity is so great that even government of India, she’s the only person".

Can you send this answer?

Sahaja Yogi: I sent that to a woman. [inaudible] It would be too long.
Shri Mataji: But, what is it?
Sahaja Yogi: I’ll send the reply that you just dictated it.
Shri Mataji: No, no, not to this woman. No, no, no. To the woman, you should try to keep it very short.
Shri Mataji: Which one? It’s a woman?
Sahaja Yogi: No
Shri Mataji: It's a man.
Sahaja Yogi: No, well that's the woman, Ruth something. That’s the woman.So, I send that...
Shri Mataji: You make it smaller, then you bring out to her. You send it later to her and a copy to the magazine. They will publish whatever they want to. The part that they...
Sahaja Yogi: To her contact thing so they can come, because that's one of the main purposes of it. Hopefully we'll be having something in there anyway. But the more people know about it [unclear]
Shri Mataji: You see, you should say, "We are not anxious that way to have more seekers but more quality".

You see, I can't use anybody's comb, that's why a comb is given to me. I used my husband's comb and I got this, just imagine! Have you seen that? Sort of an inflammation. All vibrations. Just see.

How do you find my hair, it’s better? It’s better. It was some mechanical thing. You see, everybody's hand goes into my hair, you see, and something broke.

You don't have such bad livers do you?
You think so? I'm really worried because this [food] is oily, no?

And also you should say, "We did not like the way they came and attacked Mataji. She’s a lady and just because we had taken the hall they just attacked her and they didn't allow her to talk and the fellow was just talking. It’s most surprising, I mean, we would not go to somebody. Why should they come to Mataji? If they have found their guru, they should keep to him. Why did they come to disturb? And if they want to have this, they should pay for their hall. This is atrocious the way they were behaved. They were really disturbing".

They are supposed to be realised people; this not the way to behave. We have paid for the hall, and we were there. And you should say, "Mataji has paid for the hall and she had arranged it. If they want to propagate, you should have your own hall. But this is violent with it. If you go to somebody's place and try to disturb others, and try to say all kinds of things.

You see, you should fight on this point. Write to her a big letter, and say, "Don’t be under misguidance and misconceptions about them. There was no transformation in these people. There was no sense in them. On the contrary, Sahaja Yogis were very much restrained. Actually, we were very angry the way they took advantage of Mataji. We didn't like it because she should not waste her energy on such destructive people. Why should she waste her energy on such? They just came to destroy our meeting. We were amazed. These are realised people? What are they? What sort of a guru you have?

But from Sahaja Yoga, very few people go to some new guru, very seldom. They do not go. Either they give up Sahaja Yoga, is all right, but they would not go to another guru. Even, I think, these guru maharaj people have calmed down. They are neither doing Rhumara nor Sahaja Yoga.

Sahaja Yogi: Do you remember, a couple came this friend of mine, who was doing this TM for a long time. He's just stopped.
Shri Mataji: So, that's all right, if they are possessed, they will go on with that. But they will not go to somebody new, you see. Why should they come to me? What I'm saying.
Sahaja Yogi: He stopped doing his TM.
Shri Mataji: He stopped his doing. He's finished TM. So, this is what it is. At least, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, very few people go to some other guru, or to discuss or argue to anybody else's, seldom they do it. They have no interest in going and disturbing anybody else's meeting. Notice this, I mean, you don't not go to this Yaar or anyone. You don't even think of it. On the contrary you shun them. You see, you should say, "We shun these people because they are all catching and they are nowhere". You should say that.

I haven't seen anybody changing from Sahaja Yoga to some new guru, not yet. So far. No one. Can you imagine, in the whole thousands of people. Not one. If they were doing the old thing, they'll continue with it or they'll give it up. He given up TM also.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: This point is also very important that, "Most of them drop out like addiction, their gurus, and then they may not continue with Sahaja Yoga because they do not want to give up some of their old habits. But they give up the gurus quite often". Why should they come to Mataji? This is the first question. 

Sahaja Yogi: It doesn't say a lot for their character, if they if they come to Sahaja Yoga and then, they drop the guru but they don't give up their habits. 
Shri Mataji: No, no, but that is what it is. You see, they do not want to work it out. Sahaja Yoga needs serious personality. We need true seekers. True seekers keep to it, keep to Sahaja Yoga. And the rest of them, also, those who cannot keep to it, and seldom they talk against Sahaja Yoga. I have no met, I have not met any. Those who have got realisation. Because, you see, they're not sure what to say.

At the most, they can only say one thing, "We cannot believe that Mataji is the Adishakti!" At the most! That is their weakness. But nothing more than that. What can they criticise in Sahaj Yog?

I remember these people were saying that Kundalini raising is not the only way. So, it would be something like saying that, "Germinating seed is not the way to produce, and there are some other ways also". Germination is needed! Or like saying that, "We do not need an embryo to produce a human being". It would be something like that, you see. The germinating power, if it is not there. The seed has to work with this primule to become a tree, isn't it? So, it is absolutely that.

[break in recording]

And how did she take Her form and how did she manifest? You please tell me the story of Amari Devi which kills the unhappiness. So Narayana said: Now I will tell you something which you cannot even think of. The great Jagat Janani, the one which cannot be described, which is beyond thoughts, gave moksha. And this play of hers I will describe to you. In the ancient times there was a great rakshasa, a very powerful, who was against the Gods. His name was Arun. And he used to live in the Patalok. He wanted to win over these gods, devatas, and he thought that he should somehow please Brahma. While pleasing Him, he should be able to overcome the divine powers of the Gods. Now this is Brahmas powers he wanted to have. Now Brahmas powers are not evolutionary. His powers are different. So to get those powers, this hot tempered desire, full of heat, he started doing Gayatri mantra. With heated desire, he started doing Gayatri mantra.

Now if you remember, I told you not to do Gayatri mantra. Gayatri mantra is not meant for evolution, but for getting the powers of Brahma. Brahma's powers are the five, you see, five elements and all that sort of a thing, you see.
And he did jata of Gayatri for ten thousand years and then he lived only on the water, that means starvation. This also I have told you that no penance is needed. Then after 10,000 years, he just breathed air. And after again 10,000 years, he remained without any food, 30,000 years, imagine! Like this, he did a very difficult tapa.Because of this, from his body, a tremendous heat manifested. And it started burning the whole universe. 

After seeing that, all Gods got frightened and they said, "What is all this? What is all this? This is burning all of us". Now you should know, that with cancer you get heat in the body. And every living soul was absolutely destroyed, or upset with that, and they went to Brahma and surrendered to
Him.

When he heard from the devatas that this tapa was performed in his name, he took Gayatri with him, and on his hamsa - hamsa is the conveyance of Brahma, he climbed on that and with very great happiness, you see, he went to see this daitya, means rakshasa. He saw him, another burning fire, like the fire that he had, and he said, "Oh my child, you ask me whatever you want, according to your desire". This is Brahma.
So, he said, according to his own intelligence that, "You should give me a boon by which I should never die". After hearing this, Brahma explained to him with great respect that, after taking birth, every person has to die. Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh also have to die. That is why any intelligent man would not ask for such a boon. "You should ask for some other boon".
So, he said, "Then you give me this boon that I should not be killed in the battle, that nobody should kill me with a weapon. No man or woman should kill me. Neither somebody with two feet or four feet. Anyone should not be able to kill me. And one more boon you must give that, I must get a lot of powers within me and I should be able to win all the devatas".
Then Brahma said, "All right, this will happen". And he gave these blessings to him and he went to his own Brahmalok.

Now he, the Arun rakshasa, went to Patala and there he became the king of the rakshasas, daityas. All the Daityas accepted his sovereignty. Then all the Gods decided to kill him and they started planning about killing him. Before they could do anything, this rakshasa attacked the devatas with a very big army of his and in this, the devatas lost the war. Then this big, powerful rakshasa, who had become very powerful with his tapa, started taking advantage of Surya, Chandra, Yama he's the God of the dead, you see. And using their powers one by one.

Then all the powers were lost, of the Gods. So, they went to Kailash to pray to Shiva and they started telling him in different ways, to Bhagwan Shankar, their own pains and troubles and tribulations.

Then after hearing that, Shiva started thinking, "What can we do?" That time, there was a big aparshivan, means in the sky, the sky starts speaking, the sky spoke, you see. They said, "You pray to Bhuvaneshani. She is the one who can save you. Bhuvaneshani is the one who is the Adishaki. Somehow or another, if she could remove Gayatri from that rakshasa, then only he can be killed".

The sky sound was very loud one. After hearing this divine message, the Gods went to Brihaspati who was their Guru, and ask him that, "What should we do? Our Gods have lost". I mean the Gods have lost at the hand of this rakshasa. "You do something by which this rakshasa gives us Gayatri. And he said, "While we all will pray to Bhagavati, Parmeshani, to her, Parameshwari, we'll pray to her so that she will be happy with us and she will help us".

So, they went to the Goddess Jambun, Chamundeshwari and started serving her. And they used the Maya veej for their japa. And they started doing the devi yagya. All right?

Brihaspati also reached the place where this rakshasa was, and after seeing him coming the king of the daityas, asked him, "Oh great muni, why have you, from where have you come? Why have you come? I'm not belonging to your side, but I'm not opposing you".

When the muni, the great among the munis heard this, he asked, he said, "Oh King, we are the worshippers of a Goddess and you also worship her. That's why your questions and ours, your side and ours is the same". After hearing about the affection of the gods for the goddess, gods for the Devi, he accepted to give up his great mantra of gayatri. And as soon as he gave up gayatri, he became without any light.

This way, when Brihaspati was successful, he went to Indra who was the King of the devatas and told him that this happened. By this, all the Gods were very much happy and they started praising Parameshwari. This way, when they were praising the Parameshwari for quite a long time, that time, once upon a time, the one who has come, who is for the salvation of the whole universe, she is the Jaganmata herself manifested. She was beautiful and her face was shining like many suryas.

After taking her darshan, Brahma and other Gods, everyone, was very much happy and they started pleasing the Mother Bhagavati. They said, "Hey Bhagawati, we all bow to you. You are the one who creates. You are the one who destroys and you are the one who sustains".

"Oh Goddess, you are the one who can in this earth, in this world, can come in the form of the Viraat with all the world around you. And this for me, "I bow to you". The Goddess which is full of concern, but who is full of concern, though she is in the heart, the one who is the energy of this world of illusion, the one who is the Vision, statue or image of compassion. The one who is dharma, I bow to you. I say namaskar to you.
The one who is divine, the one who is knowledge and brilliance, we all bow to thee. You are the Gayatri. So, you are the one to whom we bow. You are the Savitri, You are the Swadhe, You are the Darshini, we bow to thee. Oh, Mother, we bow to you. We are all sustained by you. 

You are the one who can only be recognised by saying, "Not this, not this". And the one who comes in her- who is Sarva Pratyaksha Rupini. Means Pratyaksha is Sakshat, you see. She is the Sakshat of everything, who gives us the proof of everything. You are the Paradevi (supreme goddess), you are above all the Goddesses and we worship you.

She is surrounded by her disciples like the lotus surrounded by bees, like the bees. She is surrounded by her disciples like the bees surround the lotus. We bow to her all the time.

"Oh Ambike, we bow to you in front, to our back, on the higher and the lower, everywhere, we bow to you, always".

When she heard the very beautiful praise and the delicate praise of her Gods, she, in a very sweet voice says, "Oh Gods, I'm happy with you. All of you ask for whichever you like". This is just now I said it.

After hearing the words of the Goddess, they told her about the daitya, how he was torturing them.

Hearing the unhappy story, Bhagavati as Bhramari (Goddess of bees), here she is called as Bhramari, she has those who were near her, her disciples, who were as her bees. So, she told them, which are in her front and at her back, or on her hands, and in the front and in the far outside, she told her that, "You go thousands of you go and cover all the universe, all the three universes". These are the three lokas, you see.

The sky, all the mountain peaks, all the jungles, and all the plains, were covered by these bhramaras. The bhramaras are these bees, you see, these black bees. It was so, such a fantastic thing done, that the whole place became absolutely dark.

And these bhramaras, because he had got the boon from Brahma, that no human being should do it, no four feet or two feet should beat. So, she made them into bhramaras, and the bhramaras had six feet, you see. So, they went and started eating those rakshasas. And nobody could stop them with any weapon. They started eating them off. And there was no war, nothing as was promised to him. And there was no talking, because he said there should be no talking about it. Every rakshasa was killed where he was. And they were all destroyed, in whatever condition they were, they were all destroyed. And all of them were destroyed by these bhramaras.

When they finished the work, she called back her bhramaras and then, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu and all Gods were very happy and they started singing their songs of worshipping.

Then Bhramari being pleased by their different praises and their devotion, she gave them different boons. Then she disappeared suddenly. This way, Bhramari Devi came on this Earth and she created such a great miracle by killing this daityas who were trying to have some kind of a boon.

By reading this about Bhramari Devi, all your sins will be destroyed. And this will take you beyond the the gunas, means you will be Realised.
In the same way, when we read about all the ??? all our sins can be destroyed. But this is a very great auspicious time, where we are hearing the Devi Mahatmayam when I am describing to you this great result. The one who reads this becomes ??? and all his sins are killed.
