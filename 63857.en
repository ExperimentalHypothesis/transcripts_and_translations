Conversation with Sahaja Yogis, Creation of Sahaj material, the story of Shri Bhramari, London, Ashley Gardens (England), September 7th, 1978

[Shri Mataji dictates a letter]

Should I start?So my dear saints, whatever it is, we are a group of people who have assembled together through our true seeking and all of us have been to all kinds of various gurus and various acts of seeking, because we were anxiously seeking the truth.

In our seeking, we had to go through all the ancient scriptures, not only Indian, but also other scriptures like Koran and Torah and the Bible. We have read also the Indian scriptures with very great care. Some of them have read some books and some others have read some others. But, we would like to point out that Kundalini awakening is to be understood in its all seriousness and in its all true, real form. The Vedas, which are four, Upanishads, Darshanas, Puranas, [unclear- 3:20] and Tantra Vidyanas, all of them point out that Kundalini, even Gita, - Gita you put it, note it Gita- that Kundalini is the primule or the germinating power within us, which gives us Realisation, which is the evolutionary manifestation of human bases. All other things, which people talk about will not lead to evolution, but they may develop some powers which are supraconscious in nature or subconscious.

We have met eight disciples at least of your guru mister Yaar. We would like to tell you that only one person was a Realised soul, which was a born Realised, and has been utilised by your guru, as his own disciple. Why your guru himself is not a Self-realised being? You may ask, "How do we say this with such authenticity?" But we would like to, very humbly, inform you that we got Self-realisation through to grace of HH Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and that we have vibrations, into in brackets: (Chaitanya Lahari described by Adi Shankaracharya) supported by all these great scriptures, by which we can know if a person is Realised or not. Not only that, but we can cure people mentally, physically and emotionally disturbed.

Apart from that, we can raise the Kundalini and show you how it rises with your naked eyes. And also can grant Self-realization. It is a fantastic statement, but it is so. We do not claim ourselves to be the master gurus, as your Guru does, without Self-realization. But there are 300 of us, Western Sahaja Yogis in London, and there are thousands all over the world.We can perform Kundalini awakening by the grace of Mataji Nirmala Devi, and we have seen that she has given en-masse Realization to thousands of people. I would say the test of a guru is that a genuine Guru bestow all his powers to his disciples. He does not expect anything in the return, but gives all his powers to his disciples and does not take a credit of something that he has not done. Because a one disciple, if he is a born Realized, Mataji immediately tells that person that, "You are a born Realized". And then she teaches that person how to use that vibratory awareness which she has got it. She establishes him in his awareness and his Self-realization and gives all the information needed how to manoeuvre, work out, and respect the power that he has got.

Apart from that, her exposition of Sahaja Yoga has completely shown the integration of all the incarnations, whether it was Christ, Muhamad or Guru Nanak, whether it was Rama, Krishna or Mary, Mother of Jesus, or Fatima. She has given meaning to all that was historically accepted as great religions, denied nothing. And she has shown a complete understanding co-relationship and the bearing of all these happenings which were called as miracles. As if in a dark room the light has appeared. And we have been able to verify all this through our vibratory awareness.

For your information, you are also not a Self-realized soul but you call yourself ‘saved’, you are free to do that. But you have no vibratory awareness. When we asked some of the disciples of Mister Yaar, to tell where our Kundalini was they could not tell. But we could tell them that it is all frozen in different places. We could tell them what chakras were caught, and what diseases they have. Of course, we do not have their names. But if you find out, I think they came just to disturb Mataji's lectures, and ask foolish questions and to dominate the scene. This is not a sign of a saint. If you really, if you are a real seeker or anybody who is a seeker should try to come and attend our programs which are absolutely free, without any obligation, and should not try to disturb. On the contrary, should not try to disturb us. In Catherine’s home, she has a program every week, it’s on Monday.

But if you are a real seeker, you will come. Of course, to our amazement we have found out that many are soiled and spoiled by brainwashing of many gurus who call themselves incarnations and call themselves as masters. There are many like that. And there are so many of them are ruined because they have been to wrong people and their actually kundalinis have been frozen down.

It is - it should not be surprising for you, that few people turn up. It is never surprising to us if few people turn up to our Sahaja Yoga programs. Because it is a reality in which a person is transformed and has to adhere to his transformation with little discipline. It is not a toothbrush selling organization, where an advertisement says that, "This is the cure for all your ailments". But Kundalini is the only thing that does it, no doubt. But we have not met even a single person who has given the powers that Mataji has given us. Apart from that, she has given us the complete knowledge of Kundalini and all its awakening and all of this thing, without keeping any secrets about it. It's all freely available to you. If you want you can come along, not to quarrel and fight, but to really receive what is Self-realization, reaching is the place in the kingdom of God, where one enjoys the bliss and joy. The Collective Consciousness, which is established in the Sahaja Yoga is called as, Samarth Chaitanya, in the in the scriptures.

This Collective Consciousness is manifested as if we are like a like a build-in computer and suddenly we are connected with the mains. The whole thing starts working and a rapport is established and the communication takes place. ‘Chaitanya Lahari’ is the book, at least, to be read by anybody who talks about Kundalini. If you have not even read that book then don't depend on Mr Yaar, excuse-me, your Guru the great, who is not a guru because he's not higher than you at least not than us.[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: ... told me the three things that he wants to have. First, he said is the introduction.Sahaja Yogi: Yes this is, that's a different one. This is another one that we tried to organize a while ago, I don't know if you remember.Shri Mataji: Hum? Organize?Sahaja Yogi: Open door.Sahaja Yogi: A while ago where you're allowed to have your own program.

Shri Mataji: Now I’ll tell you one thing, very simple thing is Rama is a great photographer, all right? Now what we can do, we can make a very dramatic thing with that. And we can use it. And he- we have got a film making camera also. So, we can take a film. We can just buy- we have to just buy a film and we take films and things. And we have to give some things like that and the film will be ready. And I ask Rama to do that for me. Within 8 days we can prepare a film.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. This one.Shri Mataji: So, there won't be much problem, you see. In that film, we can use some of the photographs. And you enlarge them and use them showing how she does it. I need not be, personally be there, but you can show my photograph.Sahaja Yogi: The thing is that we have to be accepted which um-Shri Mataji: If you say, tell them-Sahaja Yogi: I spoke to them. We've already sent in something and they'll be considering all the things that they have in about a week and a half's Time. But I spoke to them very recently and they said that, if I want, if we wanted to send in more detailed information about Sahaja Yoga. They could have to consider, you know, to look at when they consider the thing.Shri Mataji: You should say-Sahaja Yogi: So, I was thinking we could send in more detail.Shri Mataji: You sent the detail, all right.Sahaja Yogi: Because we just sent a small form see something I don't know if we remember when you-Shri Mataji: You do that but you should say that, "We have, instead of making any program, we already have a film on it which you can show". It's much simpler.

Sahaja Yogi: Well, no, no. We're allowed, you see, we're allowed to have our time, completely for ourselves.Shri Mataji: Yes, so we can show film then.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: Instead of two week-ends arranged, it’s much better. You see, we can make it much more interesting. You can say Gods, Goddesses we can show Ganesha.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. We can put-Shri Mataji: You see -Sahaja Yogi: That can be used.Shri Mataji: That will be very good. I can write a script for it. How many minutes?Sahaja Yogi: I think it's about half an hour.Shri Mataji: Good. You can put my tapes also in between. You see, we can have that -Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but the thing is, we have to write to them just to give them more information. So, we can have the program.Shri Mataji: Yes. We tell them that, "You let us know, we'll need at least a month to prepare it. Because we are going to give you a complete film so you won't have any headache".

Sahaja Yogi: We need to give them more information about Sahaja Yoga at the moment so that if they –Shri Mataji: Yes, that is true. But –Sahaja Yogi: Yes so would you like to say anything.Shri Mataji: About that?Sahaja Yogi: If you want to. I mean I'm quite happy to go ahead myself.Shri Mataji: I think Gavin can do. Both of you put together, you can do it, you see, you can tell them. But these are the points to be stressed you see. That, "We have found it, you see, by this". I have not put addiction, illness. Addiction, you can put it. "You get cured of addictions and imbalances".
