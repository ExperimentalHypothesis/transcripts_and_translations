[Shri Mataji dictates a letter]

Should I start?
So my dear saints, whatever it is, we are a group of people who have assembled together through our true seeking and all of us have been to all kinds of various gurus and various acts of seeking, because we were anxiously seeking the truth.

In our seeking, we had to go through all the ancient scriptures, not only Indian, but also other scriptures like Koran and Torah and the Bible. We have read also the Indian scriptures with very great care. Some of them have read some books and some others have read some others. But, we would like to point out that Kundalini awakening is to be understood in its all seriousness and in its all true, real form. The Vedas, which are four, Upanishads, Darshanas, Puranas, [unclear- 3:20] and Tantra Vidyanas, all of them point out that Kundalini, even Gita, - Gita you put it, note it Gita- that Kundalini is the primule or the germinating power within us, which gives us Realisation, which is the evolutionary manifestation of human bases. All other things, which people talk about will not lead to evolution, but they may develop some powers which are supraconscious in nature or subconscious.

We have met eight disciples at least of your guru mister Yaar. We would like to tell you that only one person was a Realised soul, which was a born Realised, and has been utilised by your guru, as his own disciple. Why your guru himself is not a Self-realised being? You may ask, "How do we say this with such authenticity?" But we would like to, very humbly, inform you that we got Self-realisation through to grace of HH Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and that we have vibrations, into in brackets: (Chaitanya Lahari described by Adi Shankaracharya) supported by all these great scriptures, by which we can know if a person is Realised or not. Not only that, but we can cure people mentally, physically and emotionally disturbed.

Apart from that, we can raise the Kundalini and show you how it rises with your naked eyes. And also can grant Self-realization. It is a fantastic statement, but it is so. We do not claim ourselves to be the master gurus, as your Guru does, without Self-realization. But there are 300 of us, Western Sahaja Yogis in London, and there are thousands all over the world.
We can perform Kundalini awakening by the grace of Mataji Nirmala Devi, and we have seen that she has given en-masse Realization to thousands of people. I would say the test of a guru is that a genuine Guru bestow all his powers to his disciples. He does not expect anything in the return, but gives all his powers to his disciples and does not take a credit of something that he has not done. Because a one disciple, if he is a born Realized, Mataji immediately tells that person that, "You are a born Realized". And then she teaches that person how to use that vibratory awareness which she has got it. She establishes him in his awareness and his Self-realization and gives all the information needed how to manoeuvre, work out, and respect the power that he has got.

Apart from that, her exposition of Sahaja Yoga has completely shown the integration of all the incarnations, whether it was Christ, Muhamad or Guru Nanak, whether it was Rama, Krishna or Mary, Mother of Jesus, or Fatima. She has given meaning to all that was historically accepted as great religions, denied nothing. And she has shown a complete understanding co-relationship and the bearing of all these happenings which were called as miracles. As if in a dark room the light has appeared. And we have been able to verify all this through our vibratory awareness.

For your information, you are also not a Self-realized soul but you call yourself ‘saved’, you are free to do that. But you have no vibratory awareness. When we asked some of the disciples of Mister Yaar, to tell where our Kundalini was they could not tell. But we could tell them that it is all frozen in different places. We could tell them what chakras were caught, and what diseases they have. Of course, we do not have their names. But if you find out, I think they came just to disturb Mataji's lectures, and ask foolish questions and to dominate the scene. This is not a sign of a saint. If you really, if you are a real seeker or anybody who is a seeker should try to come and attend our programs which are absolutely free, without any obligation, and should not try to disturb. On the contrary, should not try to disturb us. In Catherine’s home, she has a program every week, it’s on Monday.

But if you are a real seeker, you will come. Of course, to our amazement we have found out that many are soiled and spoiled by brainwashing of many gurus who call themselves incarnations and call themselves as masters. There are many like that. And there are so many of them are ruined because they have been to wrong people and their actually kundalinis have been frozen down.

It is - it should not be surprising for you, that few people turn up. It is never surprising to us if few people turn up to our Sahaja Yoga programs. Because it is a reality in which a person is transformed and has to adhere to his transformation with little discipline. It is not a toothbrush selling organization, where an advertisement says that, "This is the cure for all your ailments". But Kundalini is the only thing that does it, no doubt. But we have not met even a single person who has given the powers that Mataji has given us. Apart from that, she has given us the complete knowledge of Kundalini and all its awakening and all of this thing, without keeping any secrets about it. It's all freely available to you. If you want you can come along, not to quarrel and fight, but to really receive what is Self-realization, reaching is the place in the kingdom of God, where one enjoys the bliss and joy. The Collective Consciousness, which is established in the Sahaja Yoga is called as, Samarth Chaitanya, in the in the scriptures.

This Collective Consciousness is manifested as if we are like a like a build-in computer and suddenly we are connected with the mains. The whole thing starts working and a rapport is established and the communication takes place. ‘Chaitanya Lahari’ is the book, at least, to be read by anybody who talks about Kundalini. If you have not even read that book then don't depend on Mr Yaar, excuse-me, your Guru the great, who is not a guru because he's not higher than you at least not than us.
[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: ... told me the three things that he wants to have. First, he said is the introduction.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes this is, that's a different one. This is another one that we tried to organize a while ago, I don't know if you remember.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Organize?
Sahaja Yogi: Open door.
Sahaja Yogi: A while ago where you're allowed to have your own program.

Shri Mataji: Now I’ll tell you one thing, very simple thing is Rama is a great photographer, all right? Now what we can do, we can make a very dramatic thing with that. And we can use it. And he- we have got a film making camera also. So, we can take a film. We can just buy- we have to just buy a film and we take films and things. And we have to give some things like that and the film will be ready. And I ask Rama to do that for me. Within 8 days we can prepare a film.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. This one.
Shri Mataji: So, there won't be much problem, you see. In that film, we can use some of the photographs. And you enlarge them and use them showing how she does it. I need not be, personally be there, but you can show my photograph.
Sahaja Yogi: The thing is that we have to be accepted which um-
Shri Mataji: If you say, tell them-
Sahaja Yogi: I spoke to them. We've already sent in something and they'll be considering all the things that they have in about a week and a half's Time. But I spoke to them very recently and they said that, if I want, if we wanted to send in more detailed information about Sahaja Yoga. They could have to consider, you know, to look at when they consider the thing.
Shri Mataji: You should say-
Sahaja Yogi: So, I was thinking we could send in more detail.
Shri Mataji: You sent the detail, all right.
Sahaja Yogi: Because we just sent a small form see something I don't know if we remember when you-
Shri Mataji: You do that but you should say that, "We have, instead of making any program, we already have a film on it which you can show". It's much simpler.

Sahaja Yogi: Well, no, no. We're allowed, you see, we're allowed to have our time, completely for ourselves.
Shri Mataji: Yes, so we can show film then.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Instead of two week-ends arranged, it’s much better. You see, we can make it much more interesting. You can say Gods, Goddesses we can show Ganesha.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. We can put-
Shri Mataji: You see -
Sahaja Yogi: That can be used.
Shri Mataji: That will be very good. I can write a script for it. How many minutes?
Sahaja Yogi: I think it's about half an hour.
Shri Mataji: Good. You can put my tapes also in between. You see, we can have that -
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but the thing is, we have to write to them just to give them more information. So, we can have the program.
Shri Mataji: Yes. We tell them that, "You let us know, we'll need at least a month to prepare it. Because we are going to give you a complete film so you won't have any headache".

Sahaja Yogi: We need to give them more information about Sahaja Yoga at the moment so that if they –
Shri Mataji: Yes, that is true. But –
Sahaja Yogi: Yes so would you like to say anything.
Shri Mataji: About that?
Sahaja Yogi: If you want to. I mean I'm quite happy to go ahead myself.
Shri Mataji: I think Gavin can do. Both of you put together, you can do it, you see, you can tell them. But these are the points to be stressed you see. That, "We have found it, you see, by this". I have not put addiction, illness. Addiction, you can put it. "You get cured of addictions and imbalances".

You can put it yourself? I mean, it’s so mad [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: These false gurus and things, how they are not been put aside?
Shri Mataji: Yes?
[Conversation with the child
Child: How do you do?
Shri Mataji: How do you do? Beautiful.]
What happened?
Sahaja Yogi: Well I don't know. I just think I some of these like these fake gurus and all these fake people. I wonder why they come.
Shri Mataji: They are coming out the subconscious.
To someone: Just have vibrated. Will you have this also? Would you like this? So, it’s good, it’s good. But liver, that's why I was wondering whether I should give you, it’s very bad for the liver. Better not, because it has got a lot of oil in it. It's like-
Sahaja Yogi [to the child]: How you do?
Child: Nanny, nanny.
[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: So, what would you like me to tell?

Sahaja Yogi: Are they away for a while? How are they put away? How they are being destroyed? They are boundless [unsure].

Shri Mataji: Destruction has no meaning, you know?
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: Destruction has no meaning. They are going to subconscious. They have to go to Hell, OK? Then you have to give them chances also.
Sahaja Yogi: Rakshasas have got a chance.
Shri Mataji: They have. Everybody has to be given a full chance. Thirdly, you destroy someone. For example, one case.

There was one gentleman, one [unclear] guru Maharaj. And he died. When he died, he got lots of these spirits which entered into his disciples. And they really became mad. I mean there's no chance for them, no chance of saving these people.
Sahaja Yogi: So, he has died.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogi: So, that fake guru died.
Shri Mataji: And he got lots of spirits, you see, around him from the subconscious. And all his disciples have become like mad people. Now there's no chance for saving them at all. Because they can just finish off your brains. So, I want to make them, little bit assured, and gradually remove them so that your brains are intact.

I have sent a letter from South Africa. I have a disciple there, but he was a split personality when he came to me. And I treated him, he got all right. "I wanted to know the name of your guru". But he said "There are thousands here.
Sahaja Yogi: In South Africa as well.
Shri Mataji: And like that and you write, send him all the booklet and everything that we have. All the things that we have and all the information. He said, "I cannot get vibrations". Tell him how to do it. He wants some Kumkum. You can send him some Kumkum also.
Sahaja Yogi: We get his address.
Shri Mataji: No, address is with her. I've sent the letter with Rustom. "And also for your aarti" he asked for established [unclear]. I’ll be giving it to someone definitely. For Rustom only.

So, this is it. Now you’re- about Sahaja Yoga, now you know so many but the points that have to be stressed out. Very good in that small little pamphlet that you have, that Gavin has printed. 21:55
Sahaja Yogi: Will you make this [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: What, what do you mean the one?
Sahaja Yogi: This one, "I have done Sahaja Yoga after Self-realisation ..."
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: Excellent.

Shri Mataji: But you not say after Self-relation, you can use that.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: And also, the first half another that is, then what must we say or something like that.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh yes. "Because we have to tell you..."
Shri Mataji: These two, this you give them. They are very good ones.
Sahaja Yogi: Just give this out to all people.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogi: We also, do you know that we give this out.

Shri Mataji: This you give.
Sahaja Yogi: This out?
Shri Mataji: No you need not give to them.
Sahaja Yogi: To who? Newcomers or so?
Shri Mataji: To newcomers, to realize people.

Two hundred pounds like this. These are not said about masse Realization. Why masse Realization takes place, how masse Realization takes place, is the point that's what- why? That's the point that which –
Sahaja Yogi: why does it happen, because all [unclear] jump towards you.
Shri Mataji: Yes, why? So, this is a question which we can answer also. That's all you should say.

People will say that, "How is it? There must be something about Mataji. We should know what she is. And that’s mentioned about her in the scriptures. It is so clear cut that there's nothing to fear, I mean, it's already given that you'll have vibrations, you'll have cool breeze. Every scripture has said it.
Sahaja Yogi: In the in the Bible, in the Apocalypse, it is also called the Revelation of John.
Shri Mataji: It is given there that the cool breeze will be coming. Also they have described another woman who will be satanic.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, he does do that.
Shri Mataji: You see, this woman, that they have described, is a collective satanic woman, which actually describes the men and gurus who use sex. You see, this woman is that, is the collective, all the satanic gurus and things like that. Scarlet, scarlet colour. Scarlet colour means blood that has, I mean frozen blood. People with frozen blood, these gurus which have been described.

And she has to save her children from a dragon. These are these gurus. Bible is very symbolic.
Sahaja Yogi: He also says in the Bible that the lady appears with the sun and the moon has to go away,
Shri Mataji: That’s very true.
Sahaja Yogi: For a while.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's very true, yes.
Sahaja Yogi: But you don't have to go away, do you?
Shri Mataji: I have to.
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: I have to go away, no doubt.
I have to go away, you see. Otherwise, how can these people be brought in?
Sahaja Yogi: What? Pass away, you mean.
Shri Mataji: Hum? Yes, I have to pass away.

Sahaja Yogi: Before, it’s all fulfilled.
Shri Mataji: Of course, before the Kalaki comes in, I have to leave. That is far off. I have to go. I can go to my own place up there. I don't go anywhere. But it will be a Kalaki form. It can be possible that I transform myself into Kalaki. I can take a man’s form.

[Unclear, to the child] Up the sleeves.

So, of course I have to go,
Sahaja Yogi: So we won’t see the fruition of Satya Yuga?
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course, I am seeing it already. What is the sign of Satya Yuga?
Sahaja Yogi: En-masse Realisation.
Shri Mataji: Now the Shri Chakra has come down, what more is to provide [unsure: 26:38] when masse is already feeling the vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: When all the people in the world, in this mad world -
Shri Mataji: That is, that is -
Sahaja Yogi: Apocalypse. Apocalypse [unsure].
Shri Mataji: Yes. That is now. Satya Yuga has started. That is united, just now, not yet the epitome of it. It already started.

He’s trying to come, just [Unclear]
You see, he's so loving, he doesn't want to live without me.

[A child is crying. Marathi]
Bring him along. Just bring him in your hand.
[Marathi conversation about the child.]

Baba, don’t spoil him. You don't know how much he worked hard. He is my love. [Shri Mataji kisses the child.]

[Marathi conversation.]

Close the door. Poor fellow has worked so hard. She is saying he was pressing everybody's neck and pulling everybody's nose. So, she's angry with him. I said, "That was necessary". She doesn't understand little bit of [unclear]. [Marathi conversation with the child.]
He is tired. I feel so frustrated he's done so good.
[Marathi conversation with the child.]

Would you like another?

In the end, you can say that, "You may ask why, how is it, that Mataji is giving en-masse Realisation".
[Marathi conversation.]

So, you can you can say that, "For answering this question, I think you’d better come and see us".

Sahaja Yogi: Can the whole process be speeded up?
Shri Mataji: Hum? I beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry, I shall see.
Sahaja Yogi: Can the whole process of getting people Realized be speeded up if we work harder and harder? Does it depend upon us working harder?
Shri Mataji: [aside: Yes, thank you very much]
You must clear yourself. You see, what happens, you go one step forward, then you come down. You see, this is the problem. At least, now, don't doubt anything. Now you are not doubting anything. But now don't think, you see, once you just somehow or other, go forward with it, then it will help me very much. In India, you see, one man has done such a wonderful thing, that he's established at least 10 centres and thousands of disciples.
You see, it depends on you people. You are the leaders, you see, I'm not. I have no desires, you know I'm desireless. You have to pray. You have to ask for boon. You should say, "Mother, we must have Sahaja Yoga established. We must have Satya Yuga done in your presence". All these things you ask from me. Just ask from me. This is a boon you must ask.
Sahaja Yogi: Can we ask it now?
Shri Mataji: Yes, ask it everything. Also, you should ask that, "Mother, grant us a place where we can live and that we want you to be happy to see us grow". And, "In this country, you should become recognized by most of the people". Like that, you ask me. I have no desires.

Come along, Vije.
[Marathi/Hindi conversation with the child.]

This question of actualization, getting your own powers, and relationship with other scriptures and every scripture and integration, now all these points are there, lots of these.
All scriptures are explained through vibratory awareness. You see, that's the thing you must stress, with the vibratory awareness.

You can also put a point like this that, "Even her authenticity is so great that even government of India, she’s the only person [34:15]",
Can you send this answer?

Sahaja Yogi: I sent that to a woman. [inaudible] It would be too long.
Shri Mataji: But, what is it?
Sahaja Yogi: I’ll send the reply that you just dictated it.
Shri Mataji: No, no, not to this woman. No, no. This woman, you should write it in a very short way, you see.
Shri Mataji: Which one? It’s a woman?
Sahaja Yogi: No
Shri Mataji: It's a man.
Sahaja Yogi: No, well that's the woman, Ruth something. That’s a woman.
So, I send that [unclear].
Shri Mataji: You make it smaller, then you bring out to her. You send it later to her and a copy to the magazine. They will publish whatever they want. The part that they-
Sahaja Yogi: To her contact thing so they can come, because that's one of the main purposes of it. Hopefully we'll be having something in there anyway. But the more people know about it [unclear]
Shri Mataji: You see, you could say, "We are not anxious like you to have more people".
Sahaja Yogi: It’s more quality.
Shri Mataji: Unless there is quality [unclear].

[Marathi/Hindi conversation with the child.]

He is liverish.

You see, I can't use anybody's comb, that's why comb is given to me. I use my husband's comb and I got this, just imagine! Have you seen that? It is a sort of an inflammation. All vibrations. See, how do you find my hair, it’s better? It’s better. It was some mechanical thing. You see, everybody's hand goes into my hair, you see, and something broke.

[Marathi/Hindi conversation with the child.]

You don't have such bad liver, have you?
You think so? I'm only worried because this is oily, no?

And also you should say, "We did not like the way they came and attacked Mataji. She’s a lady and it just started because we had taken the hall. They just attacked her and not allow her to talk and the fellow was just talking. It’s most surprising, I mean, we would not go to somebody. Why should they come to Mataji? If they have found their guru, they should keep to Him. Why did they come to disturb?" And if they want to have this, they should pay for that. This is atrocious the way they were [unclear]. They were really disturbing".

You're supposed to be Realized people, you are supposed to be, this not the way to behave. Somebody else, we have paid for the hall, and we were there. And you should say, "Mataji has paid for the hall and she had rented it. If they want to propagate, you should have your own hall. But this is violent with it. If you go to somebody's place and try to disturb others, and try to say all kinds of things.

You see, you should fight out this one. Write to her a big letter, you say, "Don’t be under misguidance and misconceptions about them. There was no transformation in these people. There was no sense in them. On the contrary, Sahaja Yogis were very much restrained. Actually, we were very angry the way they took advantage of Mataji. We didn't like it because she should not waste her energy on such destructive people. Why should she waste her energy on such? They just came to destroy our meeting. We were amazed. These are Realized people? These are- what are they? What sort of a guru you have?

But from Sahaja Yoga, very few people go to some new guru, very seldom. They do not go. Either they give up Sahaja Yoga, it’s all right. But they would not go to another guru. Even, I think, these guru Maharaj people have calm down. They are neither doing Rhumara nor Sahaja Yoga.
Sahaja Yogi: Do you remember, a couple came this friend of mine, who was doing this TM yeah for a long time. He's just stopped.
Shri Mataji: So, that's all right, if they are possessed, they will go on with that. But they’ll not go to somebody new, you see. Why should they come to me? What I'm saying-
Sahaja Yogi: He stopped doing his TM.
Shri Mataji: He stopped his doing. He's finished TM. So, this is what it is. At least, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, very few people go to some other guru or to discuss or argue to anybody else's, seldom they do it. They have no interest in going and disturbing anybody else's meeting. Notice this, I mean, you don't not go to this mister Yaar or anyone. You don't even think of it. On the contrary, we shun. You see, you should say, "We shun these people because they are all catching and they are nowhere". You should say that.

I haven't seen anybody changing from Sahaja Yoga to some new guru, not yet. So far, no one. Can you imagine, in the whole thousands of people, not one. If they were doing the old thing, they'll continue with it or they'll give it up. He has given TM. He given up TM also.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: This point is also very important that, "Most of them drop out like addiction, their gurus, and then they may not continue with Sahaja Yoga because they do not want to give up some of their old habits. But they give up the gurus quite often". Why should they come to Mataji? It’s the first question. Hum? What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: It doesn't say a lot for their character, if they if they come to Sahaja Yoga and then, they drop the guru but they don't give up their habits. You see, it does not work out.
Shri Mataji: No, no, but that is what it is. You see, they do not want to work it out. Sahaja Yoga needs serious personality. We need true seekers. True seekers keep to it, keep to Sahaja Yoga. And the rest of them, also, those who cannot keep to it, and suddenly talk against Sahaja Yoga, I have no met, I have not met any. Those who have got Self-realisation. Because, you see, they're not sure what to say.

At the most, they can only say one thing, "We cannot believe that Mataji is the Adi Shakti, at the most. That is their weakness, but nothing more than that. How can they criticize Sahaja Yoga?

These people were saying that Kundalini raising is not the only way. It would be something like saying, "The germinating seed is not the way to produce, and there are some other ways also". Germination is needed or like saying that, "We do not need an embryo to produce a human being". It would be something like that, you see. The germinating power, if it is not there, seed has to work with this primule to become a tree, isn't it? So, it is absolutely that.

[Cut in the audio]

With this heated desire, he started doing ‘gayatri mantra’. Now if you remember, I told you not to do ‘gayatri manra’. ‘Gayatri mantra’ is not meant for evolution, but for getting the powers of Brahma. Brahma's powers are the five, you see, five elements and all that sort of a thing, you see.
And he did ‘japa’ of gayatri for 10,000 years and then he lived only on the water, that means ‘starvation’. This also, you don’t have to, no penance is needed. Then after 10,000 years, he just drank- he just breathed air. And after again 10,000 years, he remained without any food, 30 000 years, imagine. Like this, he did a very difficult ‘tapa’.

Because of this, from his body, a tremendous heat manifested. And it started burning the whole universe. After seeing that, all Gods got frightened and they said, "What is all this? What is all this? This is burning all of us". Now you should know, that with cancer you get heat in the body. And every living soul was absolutely [unclear], absolutely destroyed, or upset with that. And they went to Brahma and told him and surrendered to
Him.

When he heard from the Devatas that this ‘tapa’ was performed in his name, he took Gayatri with him, and on his - Hamsa [swan] is the conveyance of Brahma, he climbed on that and with very great happiness, you see, he went to see this ‘Daitya’, means rakshasa. He saw him, another burning fire, like the fire that he had, and he said, "Oh my child, you ask me whatever you want, according to your desire". This is Brahma.
So, he said, according to his own intelligence, "You should give me a boon by which I should never die". After hearing this, Brahma explained to him with great respect that, after taking birth, every person has to die. Even Brahma Vishnu Mahesh also have to die. That is why any intelligent man would not ask for such a boon. "You should ask for some other boon".
So, he said, "Then you give me this boon that I should not be killed in the battle, that nobody should kill me with a weapon. No man or woman should kill me. Neither somebody with two feet, two feet or four feet. Anyone should not be able to kill me. And one more boon you must give that, I must get lot of powers within me and I should be able to win all the Devatas".
Then Brahma said, "All right, this will happen". And he gave these blessings to him and he went to his own Brahma loka.

Now he, the Aron rakshasa, went to Patala and there he became the king of the rakshasas, like this. All the Daityas accepted his sovereignty. Then all the Gods decided to kill him and they started planning about killing him. Before they could do anything, this rakshasa attacked the Devatas with a very big army of his. And in this, the Devatas lost the war. Ten this big, this powerful rakshasa, who had become very powerful with his tapa, they started taking advantage of Surya, Chandra, Yama is the God of the dead, you see. And using their powers one by one. Then all the powers were lost, of the Gods. So, they went to Kailash to pray to Shiva and they started telling him in different ways, to Bhagwan Shankar, their own pains and troubles and tribulations.

Then after hearing that, Shiva started thinking, "What can we do?" That time, there was a big ‘aparshivan’, means in the sky, the sky starts speaking, the sky spoke, you see. They said, "You pray to Bhuvaneshani. She is the one who can save you. Bhuvaneshani is the one who is Adi Shaki. Somehow or another, if she could remove Gayatri from that rakshasa, you see, then only he can be killed". The sky sound was very loud one.
After hearing this divine message, the Gods went to Ganashpati and ask him who was their Guru that, "What should we do? Our Gods have lost". I mean the Gods have lost at the hand of this rakshasa.
"You do something by which this rakshasa gives us Gayatri. And he said, "While we all will pray to Bhagavati, Parmeshani, to her, Parameshwari, we'll pray to her so that she will be happy with us and she will help us".

So, they went to the Goddess Chamund, Chamundeshwari, Chamundeshwari and started serving her. And they used the ‘Maya meach’ [unsure] for their japa. And they started doing the deviyak. [Unsure] All right?

Ganashpati also reached to the- reached the place where this rakshasa was. And after seeing him coming the king of the Daityas, asked him, "Oh the great muni, why have you- from where have you come? Why have you come? I'm not belonging to your side, but I'm not opposing you".

When the muni, the great among the munis heard this, he asked, he said, "Oh King, we are the worshippers of a Goddess and you also worship her. That's why your questions and ours, your side and ours is the same". After hearing this- hearing about the affection of the Gods for the Goddess, you see, love for the Devi, he accepted to give up his great mantra of gayatri. And as soon as he gave up gayatri, he became without any light.

This way, when Ganashpati was successful, he went to Indra who was the King of the Devatas and told him that this happened. By this, all the Gods were very much happy and they started praising Parameshwari. This way, when they were praising the Parameshwari for quite a long time, that time,
once upon a time, the one who has come, who is for the salvation of the whole universe, she is the Jaganmata herself manifested. She was beautiful and her face was shining like many Suryas.

After taking her darshan, Brahma and other Gods whereas everyone was very much happy and they started pleasing the Mother Bhagavati. They said, "Hey Bhagawati, we all bow to thee. You are the one who creates. You are the one who destroys and you are the one who sustains".

"Oh Goddess, you are the one who can in this earth, in this world, can come in the form of the Virata with all the world around you.

And this for me, "I bow to thee". The Goddess which is full of concern, but who is full of concern, though she is in the heart, the one who is the energy of this world of illusion, the one who is the Vision, [cut in the audio] statue or image of compassion. The one who is dharma, I bow to you. I say namaskar to you.
The one who is divine, the one who is knowledge and brilliance, we all bow to thee. You are the Vaitarani. So, you are the one to whom we bow. You are the [Cut in the audio]

You are the Darshini, we bow to thee. Oh, Mother, we bow to you. We all are your- we are all sustained by you. You are the one who can only be recognized by saying, "Not this, not this". And the one who comes in her- who is Swaroopa Pratiksha Rupini [unsure ] means, Pratiksha is Sakshat, you see. She is the Sakshat of everything, who gives us the proof of everything. You are the Paradevi, you are above all the Goddesses and we worship you. She is surrounded by her disciples like the tanara and those people, the lotus surrounded [cut in the audio 1:06:40] by bees, like the bees. She is surrounded by her disciples like the bees surround the lotus. We bow to her all the time.

"Oh Ambika, we bow to you in front [unclear] to our back, on the higher and the lower, everywhere, we bow to you, always".

When she heard the praise of the very beautiful praise and the delicate praise of her Gods, she, in a very sweet voice says, "Oh Gods, I'm happy with you. All of you ask for whichever you like". This is just now I said it.

After hearing the words of the Goddess, they told her about the Daitya, how he was torturing them.

Hearing the unhappy story, Bhagavati as Bhramari [Goddess of bees], here she is called as Bhramari, she has those who were near her, her disciples, who were as her bees. So, she told them, which are in her front and at her back, or on her hands, and in the front and in the farwards or outside, she told her that, "You go thousands of you go and cover all the universe, all the three universes", these are the three lokas, you see. The sky, all the mountains, peaks, all the jungles, and all the plains, were covered by these 'bhramaras’. The ‘bhramaras’ are these bees, you see, were black bees. It was so, such a fantastic thing done, that the whole place became absolutely dark.

And these bhramaras, because he had got a boon from Brahma, that no human being should beat, no four feet or two feet should beat. So, she made them into bhramaras, and the bhramaras were about six feet, you see. So, they went and started eating those rakshasas. And nobody could stop them with any weapon. Then they started eating them off. And there was no war, nothing as it was promised to him. And there was no talking, because he said there should be no talking about it. The one who- every rakshasa was killed where he was. And they were all destroyed, in whatever condition they were, they were all destroyed. And all of them were destroyed by these bhramaras.

When they finished the work, she called back her bhramaras and then, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu and all Gods were very happy and they started singing their songs of worshiping.
Then Bhramari being pleased by their different praises and their devotion, she gave them different boons. Then she disappeared suddenly. This way, Bhramari Devi came on this earth and she did such a great miracle by killing this Daityas who were [unclear] because of a boon. Really

By reading this about Bhramari Devi, all your sins will be destroyed. And this will take you beyond the [unclear] means you will be Realised.
In the same way, when we read about [unclear] all your sins can be destroyed. But this is a very great auspicious time, where we are hearing the Devi Bhagavati [Purana], when I am describing to you this great result. The one who reads this [unclear] victorious becomes one with that and all his sins are killed.
