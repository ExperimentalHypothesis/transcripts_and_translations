We celebrated Diwali with yagnya of Vishnuâ€™s 1000 names. I have done it first time in all my lives.  I was very good at Sanskrit difficult words to my great surprise.  This will do lot of good to this country and the world at large. It will expedite the evolutionary process by blasting many age old adhramas of western life.

I wish I could meet your mother.  You may write to her that the source of joy is from within and not from without. No one can give you that so why worry about your surroundings? If you awaken and arise, you may illumine the darkness around you and give others the joy of your Being.
