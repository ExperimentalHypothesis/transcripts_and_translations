Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Pune, India, 01-03-1984

Shri Mataji:It’s very warm and by the time you arrive there it will be so hot that you will get sick before going home.

Sahaja Yogi Audience:laughter

Shri Mataji:That’s why I am very very anxious that you should leave early and that’s why we came last night just to leave early and we should not miss the point [UNCLEAR disappoint]. So here it is we have to leave and I am here to say goodbye to a [UNCLEAR]. At the time of parking words do not come to express yourself except for the tears. It was putrid and I enjoyed your company very much and all the people enjoyed you very much. I hope next year again we will venture again to have a trip. I hope all of you have gained something, as soon as you go back write down your experiences and small small things that interest you - all of you. It is a duty to you. Then send it over, one copy to London, so that I can see all of them - with your photographs. I don’t know how to say that we are parting because we are not, I am much closer to you then I was ever. May god bless you. Now who are the people going to UK? Raise your hand. When are you leaving?

Sahaja Yogi Audience:responds

Shri Mataji:Tomorrow evening. So you will be staying in some place and I will send you one box of mine so see to it that it gets deposited [UNCLEAR] and tell him that I hope to talk to him today on the phone by [something] as they are and getting better and all and good. Otherwise tell him I am alright, don't tell him about my sickness or anything. I am coming on the sixth morning. Alright? May god bless you. [UNCLEAR]. You all can have. [UNCLEAR]. Shri Mataji laughs.

You have to thank them that I will be moving out and you should thank them and see how loving they are and how kind and how nice. I hope you will get them some specific number of photographs that only they want. They have already given you. But [UNCLEAR].

Enjoy your self and have a nice cool bath. It's very nice. I haven’t seen the way of how people live there but it's a nice place otherwise for a picnic. [another language].

You all should take one. [UNCLEAR].
