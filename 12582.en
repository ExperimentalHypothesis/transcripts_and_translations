WR: Well, he still feels as though, even though since realization, he still feels as though the effects of the drugs are still there in the sense that he gets the same experiences. Is that true? He gets the same experiences as if he was still on drugs.

Shri Mataji: Uh hm. Why don't you sit here with your left hand towards Me, right hand outside [unclear]? What about? Who else?

WR: Who else was on drugs? Does anyone know?

Shri Mataji: You are better now. [unclear] It is there in the thing. It is better. Put your hand absolutely outside in the, in the, absolutely there. Now put your hand out. You are [unclear]?

Q: Yes, Mother. I've been on drugs.

Shri Mataji: Hm. So? You too feel the same way?

Q: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: You are feeling all right.

Q: I don't know, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You feel that the drug effect has gone now?

Q: Yes, Mother, I feel most of it is gone.

Shri Mataji: All right. What about you, Robert? Are you still feeling the drug effect on you?

WR: But you're still experiencing the same experiences as you are having at the time you are taking drugs. That's what you said first. Or are you just experiencing something else?

Q: It's just like a -

Shri Mataji: Heaviness.

Q: I can't seem to break through to get the clarity.

Shri Mataji: [unclear: sounds like I've seen someone, or I think some [unclear]]. Now, who? What else?

Q: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: You have to take salt, lot of salt. You see? Now, give him salt, vibrated salt. Now, who else is there? [unclear] But you don't have the same types of experiences now. Is thoroughly heavy.

Q: [unclear] I feel it sitting there.

WR: It's just like a fog, he describes it, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All right. Now?

Q: I'm having the same type of experiences, Mother, but it's just that -

Shri Mataji: Heaviness?

Q: Sorry?

Shri Mataji: Just a heaviness?

Q: No, my desire means my spirit, it goes towards drugs like a [unclear].

WR: He still wants them. He wants to go back to it, and he has done since realization. You don't mind me saying that? Since realization, he's had one or two, gone out and gone back, and he's trying to fight it and he's not really succeeding.

Shri Mataji: Now, you put your right to the left. That is the way. Put your right to the left. You too. No, with your right hand. Put your right hand. [unclear: sounds like You too do].

WR: Everybody notices that he uses the left. Use your right hand.

Shri Mataji: Mmm. With the right hand. So you are raising your will power. Is there any movement in your head? You find anything moving in your head?

Watch Me. You have to watch. You have to see Me. Come here. Just come here. At the back. You have to give a bandhan on My back. You just watch Me. And what else? He has a problem? Him?

Q: I'm still taking insulin for diabetes.

Shri Mataji: You still have diabetes? You have still diabetes.

Q: I have had it for ten years and I'm still taking the same amount of insulin.

Shri Mataji: Have you been coming for your blood sugar?

Q: Yes, I have [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Have not come down. What have you done for it?

Q: Well, I work on my left Nabhi and basically I'm [unclear].

Shri Mataji: You put your left to the right, left to the right.

Q: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: [unclear] Come. I'll just help you. Come here. Sit down there.

[Next section of the recording is a repeat of the section above starting "You still have diabetes"]

Keep your eyes open and watch Me.

Q: I have had eczema for quite a long time. I've had it for quite a long time, [unclear] itching, almost drives a person to distraction, and it's really hard to control.

Shri Mataji: I was telling you there is a liver problem. Are you going in for a liver treatment? And you should go on a diet. No fats, nothing, just a regular diet for liver and do that for a month. You see? Go for a liver treatment completely. [unclear] Now, liver diet is the best. That's because of My feet here. You use that. You have to use the thing according to the nature of the problem. You see, right-sided you use cool treatment, and when it is left-sided use hot treatment.

Q: [unclear] Mogodon, with heaviness on the forehead and side of the head as if I could fall asleep when You're talking and [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Come along. You have been with Dennis? Ursula?. I can see the effect. Also when you talk you talk like him. You see, you better stop using your hands for [unclear]. Dennis is one person you should forget. Those who have been with Dennis must beat themselves with shoes every day. That's how you get rid of it.

And put your hands right, has an effect.

[Person singing/chanting. Shri Mataji continues talking.]

Shri Mataji: Who's there?

Q: Mother, nothing [unclear] on the part of the media [unclear].

Shri Mataji: I'll do it, little louder. Now [unclear] like this. You are left-handed or right-handed? Put it with your right hand under My feet [unclear]. A little apart, a little away from here. Put your both hands. [unclear]

I must tell you there are certain things of protocol. When you talk to Me you shouldn't put your hands like this, talk to Me like this. You see, that's not the way. Normally, if you see, Indians always fold their hands, talking. You see, it's not the way to talk to Me. It's not proper, you see, the way you talk here, also. I think you people use too much of your hand. Otherwise, there's no need to be using all the time like this [unclear]. Looks horrid [unclear] some time. And then you, some of you talk to Me, you go on like this. That's not the way to talk. Is a sign that you are not normal. In a humble way you must talk. All right? This is a protocol. One must know best is to talk with folded hands.

Now, in India they don't call me Mother at all. Not at all. Like, "Mother, [unclear]", "Mother, come there". That's not the way. They say, "Shri Mataji", all of them. Nobody calls Me, have you heard anybody calling Me Mother? They have to learn these better methods for Sahaja Yogis because that helps them. All right?

So, one has to talk with great grace and understanding, because you know Who I am now. The best thing is to use the proper way of addressing. All right? The more protocol you have, the better you will be. You will really benefit very much more, because as you address Me, the deities are so alert. They see you how you behave. Very important to be humble. Deities are there, watching all the time, and they want to see what is your reactions, how you behave, your protocol, everything. You are seeing Indians, how they talk. They have to say something, put eyes little lower, their face. They know Whom they are talking. Even on the phone, Modi was talking, calling Me, "Shri Mataji". Shri Mataji is to be said, not Mother, Mother, Mother. It's not right. All right? For Sahaja Yogis, because it's important now. New people will be coming; they learn from you.

All right. [unclear: sounds like May God bless]. It's better. How are you [unclear]?

Q: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Huh?

Q: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: Without my photograph?

Q: No, no, not with Your photograph.

Shri Mataji: Then, OK, how did he give you? It's [unclear] who has given you. You never think he has given you. All right? You have given realization. You lose the power of giving realization. It's so bound together. What am I to do? They're all so bound together. You have to recognize. You have to honor. That's how you're going to grow. It's something so innate, everything bound together.

It's all right. You can't talk like this to people who are coming for the first time, second time, third time, all right. But you are Sahaja Yogis, all right? You are into it. You have gone to India and you've seen how people are there. Now, it's much better. [unclear: sounds like It's true]. Formerly, they never really understood it. After going to India many people have realized.

Even artists. Like, this is a very famous artist, internationally famous, a man before starting his program how he bowed before Me. Humility is very important, for your sake and for others. The one who is humble will receive the most. Little bit should be [unclear]. Got it from him. Horrible. The protocol you will gain. I don't lose anything. Whatever is eternal is eternal. That's not going to be lost. But it's you who has to strive to gain more, isn't it?

[unclear] Come along. [unclear: sounds like That sounds very [unclear], or Let's cut his hair]. Come along. That's how they hide. See, look at this forehead. You see it so clearly.

Forgive, forgive, forgive.

All right, much better now.

Come here. Come. [unclear: sounds like Hannan], you should keep it. It's better. Cleared out?

Q: [unclear] a question I would like to ask You. Have I been given my realization?

Shri Mataji: No.

Q: [unclear: sounds like I do not know]

Shri Mataji: Have you got the cool breeze in your hands? Are you feeling a cool breeze?

Q: Not in my hands, and -

Shri Mataji: In the head?

Q: But last night it went through the right side and down through my back foot [unclear] my body.

Shri Mataji: All right. Take out your, this thing, what you have. Let's try [unclear: sounds like the feet, or to feel]. All right. Come along. Put your both your hands. You have to, you have to come on your feet, on your feet. [unclear] All right. Let's see. Relax. Put out your hand.

WR: Put your hands out. Put your forehead on Her.

Shri Mataji: Forget it. Done. Also, Robert. Where is Robert? Come along, here, both of you. Now, you come this side. It's done now. We have been to all? Better give them light [unclear] Now, better? [unclear] We should not. That's the point. I give you something special.

WR: Ekadesharudra, Mother. They have their hair down over their face like veils. So many times we have asked him to put his hair up.

Shri Mataji: Which David is this?

WR: We tried.

Shri Mataji: David, why do you put your hair? Doesn't look nice. It's horrible. Your face is, see, out of proportion [unclear]. Better cut it out. It's no good. All right? You must listen, also. You must obey. You see, by obedience, you cut off your [unclear]. You must know that Your Mother knows [unclear]. What She says, She says for your good. See, that one thing you must know. Whatever She says, is for your good. All right? That doesn't look nice at all. Better remove it and put it properly. Keep your forehead open.

[unclear: sounds like hand with them]. Could you try some cloth? These are nice. [unclear] it's all cotton.

That one is very rich. That's more expensive.
