WR: Well, he still feels as though, even though since realization, he still feels as though the effects of the drugs are still there in the sense that he gets the same experiences. Is that true? Seeker: Yes
WR: He gets the same experiences as if he was still on drugs.
Shri Mataji: Uh hm. Why don’t you sit here with your left hand towards Me, right hand outside Let’s see. What about, who else?
WR: Who else was on drugs? Anyone? He was on drugs.
Shri Mataji: You are better now since I search for, sit there in the- The thing is better. Put your hand absolutely outside. Just sit in the, in the- Absolutely there. Now put your hand out. Now who else?
WR: Here ‘s another one. 
Shri Mataji : Hum; 
Q: Yes, Mother. I’ve been on drugs.
Shri Mataji: Hm. So? You two feel the same way?
[Two Yogis answer the question at the same time.]
Shri Mataji: You are feeling all right.
Q: I don’t know, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You feel that the drug effect has gone now?
Q: Yes, Mother, I feel most of it is gone.
Shri Mataji: All right. What about you, Robert? Are you still feeling the drug effect on you?
Robert: Yes Mother.
WR: But you’re still experiencing the same experiences as you are having at the time you are taking drugs. That’s what he just said. Or are you just experiencing something else?
Q: It’s just like a –
Shri Mataji: Less. Heaviness.
Q: I can’t seem to break through to get the clarity.
Shri Mataji: Now bring some 
WR: Limes? 
Shri Mataji: Yes. Now what else? You have to take salt, lots of salt, you see? Within yourself, vibrated salt. Now, who else is there? Yes? But you don’t have the same types of experiences now.
Seeker : Oh, no. 
Shri Mataji: It’s only heavy.
Seeker: No, no, it’s just sitting here. I feel it sitting there.
Shri Mataji: Hum. All right.
WR: It’s just like a fog, he describes it, Mother.
Shri Mataji: All right. Now?
Q: I’m having the same type of experiences, Mother, but it’s just that –
Shri Mataji: Heaviness?
Q: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: Just a heaviness?
Q: No, my desire means my spirit, it goes towards drugs like a [unclear].
WR: He still wants them. He wants to go back to it, and he has done since realization. You don’t mind me saying that? 
Seeker : No
WR: Since realization, he’s had one or two, gone out and gone back, and he’s trying to fight it and he’s not really succeeding.
Shri Mataji: Now, you put your right to the left. That is the best. Put your right to the left. You too. No, with your right hand, with your right hand. Hum
WR: Everybody notices that he uses the left. Use your right hand.
Shri Mataji: [to another seeker]: Mmm. You too do it. No, no like that, with the right hand. 

So you are raising your will power. Is there any movement in your head? You find anything moving in your head?
Watch Me. You have to watch. You have to see Me. Come here. Just come here. 
Shri Mataji: [to a Yogi who comes with a candle]: At the back. You have to give a bandhan on My back. 
[to a seeker]: Just watch Me. 
Now what else? 
Any other problem? 
Yes?
Seeker: I’m still taking insulin for diabetes.
Shri Mataji: Still have diabetes. 
You have still diabetes.
Seeker: Yes Mother. I have had it for ten years and I’m still taking the same amount of insulin.
Shri Mataji: Have examined your blood sugar?
Seeker: Yes, I have.
Shri Mataji: It has not come down. 
Seeker: It has not.
Shri Mataji: What have you done for it?
Seeker: Well, I worked on my left Nabhi and basically on that.
Shri Mataji: No, put your left to the right. Left to the right.
Seeker: I’ve been doing that for-
Shri Mataji: Come here, I’ll just have a look. Come forward, just let me put my foot down there. 
[Shri Mataji puts Her right foot on his left Nabbhi]. 
Keep your eyes open, watch Me.
Seeker: Watch Mother. 
Shri Mataji : Yes? [Towards another Yogi]. 

Seeker: Mother, I’ve headaches for quite a long time. I’ve had it for quite a long time, and it’s itching, almost drives a person to distraction, and it’s really hard to control.
Shri Mataji : You have a terrible liver problem. Are you going in for a liver treatment? And you should go on a diet. Not fats, nothing. There’s a regular diet for liver and do that for a month. You see? Go in for a liver treatment completely. 
Seeker: I cannot. 
Shri Mataji : It’s allright, doesn’t matter. 
[Towards another Yogi]. Now, remove ice, keep it there. 
Now rub this ice on my feet here with this part [unclear].
You have to use the thing according to the nature of the problem, which is right-sided then use cool things, and when it is left-sided, use hot things.

Seeker: Mother, I have some sort of things that rub the head, with a heaviness on the forehead and keep so. I have to fall asleep when You’re talking and the mind is always so miring [unclear] and thinking.
Shri Mataji: Come along. You have been with Terence quite a lot? I can see the effects also when you talk you talk like him. You see, you’d better stop moving your hands. Come here, I’ll see. Terence is one person you should forget. Those who have been with Terence must beat themselves with shoes every day. That’s how you’ll get rid of it.
[The Yogi comes closed to Shri Mataji]. And put your hands towards me. It has an effect.

Shri Mataji: Yes sir. 
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he has not recovered since the tour of India. He said I should speak-
Shri Mataji: I’ll do it. 
[To the Yogi who is singing]
Little louder. 

[To the Yogi at Her feet]
Done. Now vibrate my foot. 
[To someone else]
Left-hand towards me, right hand there. Put it under my foot. 
Little far, a little away from here. 
Put like this, straight hands. Hum

I must tell you there are certain things of protocol. When you talk to Me you shouldn’t put your hands like this, talk to Me like this [bigs movements of hands]. You see, that’s not the way. Normally, if you see, Indians always fold their hands, talking to me [doing namaste]. You see, it’s not the way to talk to Me. It’s not proper, it’s to- the way you talk here, also. I think you people use too much of your hand. Otherwise also, there’s no need to be using all the time like this and it looks horrid to me sometimes. And then you- some of you talk to Me, you go on like this [shaking], that’s not the way to talk. Is a sign that you are not normal. In a humble way you must talk [doing namaste]. All right? This is a protocol. One must know. Best is to talk with folded hands.
Now, in India they don’t call me Mother at all. Not at all. Like, “Mother” one calls from there: “Mother” from there, that’s not the way. They say, “Shri Mataji”, all of them. Nobody calls Me, have you heard anybody calling Me, “Mother”? So we have to learn these better methods of addressing, because that helps us. All right?
So, one has to talk with great grace and understanding, because you know Who I am now. So best thing is to use the proper way of addressing. All right? 
The more protocol if you heard, the better you will be. You will really benefit very much more, because as you address Me, the deities are so alert, they see you, how you behave. Very important to be humble. Deities are there, watching all the time, and they want to see what is your reaction, how you behave, your protocol, everything. You have seeing Indians, how they talk. They have to say something, with eyes little lower, and they say it- They know Whom they are talking. 
Even on the phone, Modi was talking, calling Me, “Shri Mataji”. Shri Mataji is to be said, not “Mother, Mother, Mother”. It’s not proper - all right? - for Sahaja Yogis, because it’s important now. New people will be coming: they’ll learn from you.
Shri Mataji: [to the Yogi with a candle]: All right, good. May God bless you. 
Shri Mataji: [to a seeker]: It’s better?
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: How were you with him?
Seeker: Very quiet.
Shri Mataji: Huh?
Seeker: Gavin gave me my Realization.
Shri Mataji: Who? He gave you.
Seeker: In the beginning, yes.
Shri Mataji: Without my photograph?
Seeker: No, no, with your photograph.
Shri Mataji: Then, how can- how did he give you? It’s me who has given. 
Seeker: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: So never think he has given you. [unclear] All right? 

Once you start feeling that you have given Realization, you lose the power of giving Realization. It’s so true, [Shri Mataji laughs softly] it’s so bound together, what am I to do? They’re all so bound together. You have to recognize. You have to honor. That’s how you’re going to grow. It’s something so innate, everything bound together.
It’s all right, you can talk like this to people who are coming for the first time, second time, third time, all right. But you are Sahaja Yogis, all right? You are into it, you have gone to India and you’ve seen how people are there. 
Now, it’s much better, but formerly, they never really understood it. After going to India many people have realized.

Even artists, like this, he’s a very famous artist, internationally famous man, before starting his program, how he bowed before Me. 
Humility is very important, for your sake and for others’ sake. The one who is humble will receive the most. 
Seeker: [at the feet of Shri Mataji; not audible,]
Shri Mataji: Beat him with shoes every day. You got it from him. 
Horrible. 

By protocol you will gain [Shri Mataji laughs softly]. I don’t lose anything. Whatever is eternal is eternal. That’s not going to be lost. But it’s you who has to strive to gain more, isn’t it?
Seeker: [unclear]

Sahaja Yogini: Really, they were all addicts.[?] 
Shri Mataji: Come along [to a seeker] 
Let’s have Diarrhea![?] 
[All Sahaja Yogis laugh.]
Shri Mataji: Come along. That’s how they hide! 
[The seeker is in front of Shri Mataji] 
See, look at this forehead. You can see it so clearly.
Forgive, forgive, forgive.

[Cut in the video] 
Shri Mataji: All right, much better now.
Shri Mataji: Yes? 
Seeker: At first question, I would like-
Sahaja Yogi: Can you just wait. 
Shri Mataji: Come here, come here. 
Sahaja Yogi: Turn the music.... 
Shri Mataji: No, no, music, keep it, it’s better. Clears out your Vishudhi.
Seeker: This question I would like to ask is : if I’ve been given my Realization?
Shri Mataji: Oh. [Shri Mataji laughs]
Seeker: I do not know.
Shri Mataji: Have you got the cool breeze in the hands? Are you feeling a cool breeze?
Seeker: Not in my hands, and –
Shri Mataji: In the head?
Seeker: But last night it went through the right side and down to my [unclear] foot. It stopped here, it didn’t go to the left side of my body. 
Shri Mataji: All right. Take out your, this thing, water [unclear]. Let’s rub the feet. All right. Come along. Now put your, both the hands. You have to come on your knees. Tell him how to do it. On you knees, all right. 
Let’s see.
WR: Put your hands ....
Shri Mataji: Do like this. Now put down your hand. Yes
[Cut in the video] 

[Sahaja Yogis laugh.]
15:28
Forget it. Done. Also, Robert. Where is Robert? Come along, here, both of you. Now, you come this side. It’s done now. 

Sahaja Yogi: It’s better to keep this here
Shri Mataji: You have been to also. 
Now, better give them lights. Nothing. Mind over it. 

[Cut in the video] 
Shri Mataji: Ah. Better?
Seeker: Yes, that’s right.[unclear] 

Shri Mataji: Yes. I’ve seen that. You should not, because that’s a part. The body has something special.
WR: Ekadasharudra, Mother. They have their hair down over their face, like David. So many times we have asked him to put his hair off it.
Shri Mataji: Which David is this?
WR: [unclear] 
Shri Mataji: David, why do you put your hair? Doesn’t look nice. It’s horrible, Your face, you see, out of proportion it goes. Better cut it out. It’s no good. All right? 
You must listen, also. You must obey. You see, by obedience, you cut off your ego that’s why. You must know that Your Mother knows everything : what She says, She says for your good. See, that one thing you must know. Whatever She says, is for your good. All right? That doesn’t look nice at all. Better remove it and put it proper, keep your forehead open.

[Cut in the video] 
[There are carpets on the floor] 
Shri Mataji: Beauty. 
Sahaja Yogi : These are lotuses Shri Mataji. 
Shri Mataji : All hand done. If you put it on some top then we can see how nice. [unclear] Somebody has to go[unclear] a tall person. 
That one is very rich, that’s more expensive.
Sahaja Yogi : This is a real beauty. 
Shri Mataji : This is a real beauty.
