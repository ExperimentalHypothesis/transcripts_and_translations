Conversation with Sahaja Yogis about Portugal, 1980

Shri Mataji: But they don’t know cooking they said.Sahaja Yogi: They know a little bit. Ricardo knows a little bit of it.Shri Mataji: Does he know you are his side?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, he knows.Shri Mataji: Then that really is very, very, they are very much playing there.[About the baby] Now, she’s singing. We should not show that we are paying attention to her, otherwise becomes self-conscious.You didn’t think that that can please children, very little things there.

Then I saw Portugal is like that, I felt maybe the over-industrialized countries may become like that only.Sahaja Yogi: All alike.Shri Mataji: You see, this unemployment, and these are not very good signs for any country. That’s how it starts. It started the same way in Portugal. People got unemployed, and they’ve got out of their country. Now out of the, I don’t know, six million people in Portugal there’s only one million people they only think about, left. All the rest are out. And the proportion is much more, I think.Sahaja Yogi: In Brasilia, in Sao Paolo or Brasilia, that is a city from Brasil, there are more Portuguese than in our whole country.Shri Mataji: That’s it.Sahaja Yogi: More than in Portugal and in France too. They don’t want Portuguese anymore. No one, nobody wants Portuguese. That reputation we have, very bad. In France they hate, they hate us, and in Brasil they make jokes about Portuguese people. They don’t like us. Portuguese people don’t take bath, they say.Shri Mataji: Don’t take?Sahaja Yogi: Don’t take bath when they work in France and things like that. They say about us.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: They say about us that we don’t wash ourselves. Workers are not used to take baths and things like that. They don’t like it.Shri Mataji: French people say so?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, and it’s real.Shri Mataji: Do they take baths, French?[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.Shri Mataji: Oh.Another Sahaja Yogi: It’s racialism Mother, just racialism.Shri Mataji: Portuguese are much more clean than French are. What are they talking?Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.Shri Mataji: Horrible dirty people. No morals, nothing, all bathrooms. That’s why they have this perfumery.No need to say that about Portuguese, sometimes I can’t believe it. All racialism, that’s what it is.

That way, Americans are the only people who are American- really we should say, take baths in India. That’s true. They are very clean and, but otherwise everywhere, the whole of Europe is just the same. Worst is France, worst.Sahaja Yogi: The worst.

Sahaja Yogini: A lady on the phone, Mother. She wanted the Harlem Globetrotters.[Laugher]Another Sahaja Yogi: She wanted to find out about the Harlem Globetrotters Mother. They are an American basketball team. And she thought this was the Brighton center. Only it’s Sahaja Yoga center.Shri Mataji: Really? For the Globetrotters?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: You must put a- can you put a sign board here?Sahaja Yogi: Of course.Shri Mataji: You better put. You should really pay for it.Sahaja Yogi: We were not sure Mother because it’s a rented accommodation, and they may get funny about it. But we are going to tell them.Shri Mataji: You ask them.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.Shri Mataji: You ask the lady.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.Shri Mataji: If she agrees.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother
