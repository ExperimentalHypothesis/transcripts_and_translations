Talk to Sahaja Yogis

But they don't know cooking they said. They know a little bit. They had to know a little bit of it. Does he know you are his side? Yes, yes, he knows. Then that really is very, very, they are very much playing there. Yes, she's saying you something. We should not show that we are paying attention to her, otherwise becomes self conscious. You can think that that completes to them, that they have everything there. Then I saw Portugal is like that, I felt maybe the over-industrialized countries may become like that only. All are like this Mother. You see, this unemployment, and these are not very good signs for any country. That's how it starts. It started the same way in Portugal. People got unemployed, and they've got out of their country. Now out of the, I don't know, six million people in Portugal there's only one million people they only think about, left. All the rest are out. And the proportion is much more I think. In Brasilia, in Sao Paolo or Brasilia, that is a city from Brasil there are more Portuguese than in our whole country. That's it. Mother, in Portugal and France too, they don't want Portuguese anymore, and nobody wants Portuguese. That reputation we have. Very bad. In France they hate, they hate us, and in Brasil they make jokes about Portuguese people. They [don't like] us. Portuguese people don't take care of us they say. Don't take? Don't take care of us when they were in France. Things like that. They say, Mother... Yeah? They say "what happens if we don't push ourselves" and want us to take, I'm not used to take baths but that they don't like it. French people say so? Yes, Mother. Do they take baths, French? No, I don't know. It's racialism Mother, just racialism. Portuguese are much more clean thaan French are. What are they talking? I don't know. Horrible, they are digging it up. No morals, nothing. All bathrooms. That's why they are always perfumering. Now that they say that about Portuguese. Sometimes I can't believe it. All racialism. It's very clear. That too are very concerned Indian people who are I mean really used to, say, take baths in India. That's true. They are very clean and, but otherwise everywhere, the whole of you are not. It's just the same. Worst is France, worst. A lady on the phone, Mother. She wanted the Harlem Globetrotters. She wanted to find out the Harlem Globetrotters Mother. They are an American basketball team and she saw this was the Brighton center. Only it's Sahaja Yoga center. Really? It isn't written. For the Globetrotters? Yes. You must put up a, then let's put a sign over there. Of course. You better put. You should really going to add. Though I'm not sure Mother because it's a rented accommodation, and I may get fined with adding it. But we are good teenants. You ask them. Yes, Mother. You ask the lady. Yes, Mother. If she agrees. Yes, Mother. [Hindi] Ha, where is the table now? Where is the table now? These are made in England you know. Not Italy. Ha, that's it, very heavy. They also ill treat Italians very much, in a way. Don't you think so, Pedro? Yes. These people... And even C.P. was telling Me that some were there in Norway and Sweden and they were given lower wages than the local people and... For Italians. Yeah. And you can't do under international laws. You have to give the same wages, you see. And there were some... May God bless you. Some underhand things, they used. So that is our racialism. Mother but in France they don't like Italians. In France they don't like Italians. They treat them very, you know... Even, even France? Yes, France don't like Italians. What do the French think of themselves? Oh, that they are the best. Are these types of French one must arrive? Well, their Roland is the best. It's very wrong then. You know when I heard I was surprised at. Even internationally it is accepted that we have to treat everyone the same way. But that's one point I must say about Americans really they don't have so much of racialism. They have only for blacks and whites but otherwise they don't have. Even blacks and whites it is not so much [uprised] we see it in England. Not so sharp. They have crossed that quite a lot. They are very cosmopolite. That's something creditable to them. In America you'll find so many races, all kind. Indians are treated very well. Not the way they are treated in England. Italians, also. So many Italians have shops. Yes. Now you make some tea for Me? Make some tea for Me. I think that some food will be for children. Good. He taught you. Press it. He's sturdy and good. But Italians are such craftsmen and such artists. What do they think of themselves? French. I don't know Mother. Maybe they are jealous, because Italians when they work they are very clever, with the hands and... With the hands, with art. And with paintings. Designing, for designing they are very good. The quality also of all these things, are very good quality. And even today it is good. Yes, yes. I don't know why, why French have this kind of a... Because they import by the, the Italian's fault is better achievements and the French just don't like it. That's it. Jealousy. Yeah. All, all salesmen in fact, they say "Oh, Italian products, they are fine products, we are going to trade with these because it's cheaper then". And the French you know don't like that because it wouldn't be good for their bussiness. Yes. Where is the cover? There's a little cover attached inside. How they are changed with little things you see. I wish human beings were like that, so simple. You see, our Prime Minister's daughter in law is an Italian girl. [Indira Gandhi's]? Did you hear? No I didn't know. And her husband, you see now, is [future Prime Minister]. Indira Gandhi always thinks that she should make her children the Prime Ministers, thinks it's her father's property. So now she's trying to put him up as a Prime Minister. His wife is an Italian. Sonia, her name is Sonia. It's an Indian name, Sonia. I don't know what it means in Italy? No, it's a name. They also... Sorry, I don't know what it means but people's name is Sonia. But in Italy, they are giving rather international names like that...[unclear] It's Indian name. Sonia? Yes. Sonia it's Indian name, actually. See, like our Sonu, and I'll tell to Miss Ramani, Gavin Pallav Sonu, and out of love we'll call Sonia, out of love, you see, like that. Just like that. But that is now taken there like, Sonia. I was surprised, it's an Indian name. Or, our Cinzia. In Italy there's a name they give a lot, Cinzia. This must, this must be Chinese. Cinzia. It's a lovely little girl, her name is Cinzia. Cinzia. Or south Indian. Ah, Cynthia. Must be from Cynthia. Ah, Cynthia. Must be from Cynthia. That's met in chinese I think, cinz and all these were settled in Chinese. Like, you see, we make it sweeter we'll call it "a" like that, like to the daughter, we call her, say beti means daughter but to sweeten it "betia", like that. We are quite familiar. Not feeling shy so much. Is that one [more]? [Hindi]. Disturbed. No, I have to see the mouth. That suddenly ate [without a problem]. Now you must give me bunch otherwise. Paula, Paula is making. Or I can do it. You see what I, listen, keep it. I'll come back and have. No, I think it's ready soon, Mother. Is it ready? It's all right. Otherwise don't cook. It's so much ready Mother. Otherwise I can come back and have. I'm not in a hurry, at all. So you have to little bit educate Me about America. How to tackle them really. I'll do everything I can. I'll do everything I can. Now you just tell Me about. Or say, take it like this, when you came to Sahaja Yoga what impressed you, how you behave you see, what was your psychological barrier? Let's see that. Because you see that's how I can tackle them. What do you say? I think it was the [intimately slope] connected with the things I did before with my preconceptions about what Realization was, wasn't, and well I had to realize what I had to fulfill. It was really... All right, all right, doesn't matter, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. So through the [unclear], so I realized that, I couldn't compare it with anything, and I couldn't judge it with anything because it's [quite apart]. Come here. Come here. It's a good idea to understand it that way. You see because Sahaja Yoga has many, many aspects and many you see things are, but to whom it will appeal what is we should try to find out, isn't it? What intellectual side of Sahaja Yoga appealed to you? Oh, I didn't rely to the things I knew. Knew already. But from experience and I could see that here must be something, by which I judge other things by that rose and judged Sahaja yoga what I did before, because nothing else has given me, that thing, thoughtless awareness. So then how shoud I proceed with them? Should I tell them that, if I tell them say for example that nothing you can relate it to, whatever you have known so far. Will they be happy to know that? That, that should be a good thing to say. I mean it appealed to me anyway but rest let's see. I mean it must because there's a little thing at least that I have to seek something new, I mean something different. The newness of it, that may appeal. Yes. The idea that I had trouble with, was the only the way to deal with cause I had all these ideas within otherwise, different. No idea should have. That sort of [napoleonesian], sophisticated and modern staff, and I think they haven't been limited to one thing, cause at first was [unclear]. Accept that there's only one [way] for everyone. Tell them that seems to be a difficult thing for most people, the Nirakar. But why, the basic reason they want to have many things because see the choice, a choice, they want to have a choice. That's a very ego feeling you see, because as I told you that in America if you go, you must better ask them how to open the tap. Otherwise try to open the tap and you may find you are going into the swimming pool. And they have all different types, tiles they'll have different, the door knobs different, the opening style different, everything different. So this choice business you see. But there is no choice with Divine. It's already decided. But that you find it difficult to accept like that. When it is selling, when it is selling, then you can have choice. But when somebody's giving, how can you have choice? But you can't understand giving, because that is also not related to what you have known so far. [You are merely a human being.] Still going inside. It's like the feeding of the five thousands Mother. You are hungry? Can you believe it? Believe Mother, yes, we can. Twenty one. Now, she take it. So much. Thirty-one Mother. Really? Yes. You were all wondering. Because there was a [honey in the poppy]. So many things happen like that, little, little things you see. We had this Sahasrara program. And for that they decided a very far-fetched thing. It was to go to an absolute wild place, which you are going to have this time when you will go to India. And we had to go through a, ply through a, about hundred yards of sea to go to the other side of an island. And there is open sea the other side. So we went down. And they said they have to do the cooking. So what should we do? So the boys you see, in India, are hopeless absolutely, they don't know how to do anything whatsoever. Moody and her brother, and Mr. Pradhan and all these people, they said, "Now tell us how to do this, something cooking, simple", acchha, some sort of a pulao, rice pulao. I said, "All right." While we were driving in the car you see, I told them how to do it. I told them "Take now. For how many people?" It was for, they said about three hundred people. Three hundred people? Now you have never touched it, you don't know how to cook. They said, "Then we tell somebody." There's a cook coming out. So in the car I told them for, for three hundred people, how much rice, how much ghee, how much masala, how much everything, all that I told them in weight. In fifteen minutes I told them how to make it, everything. And, then, when we went there, it was such a perfect pulao, you can't imagine. Such a miracle. And everybody said, "We have never eaten such a pulao. Who has made this and how it has worked out?" "The cook had never done it that way", they said. And there were ten hings to be put and at least six, seven masalas to be put. This has to go there and so many things. Not like kichri. That is called like Ravan bhat, means the, as Ravana had ten heads, you see like that, it was the rice. It came out so perfect and so tasty and so fragrant, Of, I don't know, it was such a miracle for three hundred people. And they were four hundred. And the whole, I mean the masala has to be absolutely perfect for that size. And what they did, they went to the market, they all asked, "Give us so much, so much, so much, so many kilos, so many kilos", all right. And they gave it to the cook. See, this is the recipe, just try. The whole thing worked out absolutely perfect. And everybody ate and ate and ate and ate. So much so that they couldn't lift their bodies. Absolutely dead time. And I told them that returning time, better keep it six o'clock, because I know what will happen after they eat that rice. And it was absolutely sufficient for everyone. And we had taken one gentleman with us who had never been to Sahaja Yoga. He said, "I've never enjoied in my life so much, so much I enjoied now." And everything was first class and I told them about, they've made also curry out of the yogurt. "Little thing", I said, "you add to that, of the we did, called raw coconut. And the whole thing was so good that they were wondering how it was worked so exact, cause you see these spices are very dangerous thing, I mean if you have something more or less it doesn't come out. But it just worked out. And fifteen minutes I had to tell them, in the car. Ramesh was sitting in front. He was writing so many kilos, so many kilos, so many kilos, so many kilos. And forty kilos of rice was cooked. And four hundred people ate. And the, you must get the tape. Did you get the tape for other [yogis], Sahasrara day? I don't think. But was it in New Delhi? No, from Bombay. Did you get? One from Bombay. Mother, we wrote a letter with most of the talks in it. I don't think [that I did see it], Mother. I'm just saying it is going to be within the Nirmala, you know their names, [unclear name]. Then it's all right. Then it's all right. If it is translated should be all right. Yesterday's speech was good, was not at all bad. It was very good, isn't it? It has cleared out many people, it was nicely balanced. So now, the first thing I have to tell them, and you say it, that it does not relate to what you have known so far. But with Americans another problem is they are very sold out to traditions. So if you talk, if endeavours... I must tell you an experience. There was one fellow with the, very well known man there, who does lot of hindi this that, came to see Me. And when I was talking to him then he asked Me, "What do you think of [Shivananda]?" Right, have some more. Jugglery going on. And that gentleman, he said that, no I told him that, "He was not good, Ramakrishna was not good". Immediately he folded all his [papers]. And then he said, "I [am gratified]. Thank you very much". And then these people telephoned to him. They said, "Why, why did you behave like this towards Mother? Why did you do this? So he said, "But, you see, this Sahaja Yoga is not registered". He said: "What do you mean?" He said, " Why should She say such a thing about Ramkrishna? According to them Ramkrishna is very traditional. In which way Ramkrishna is traditional? That he used to dance, he used to dress up like a lady, do all kinds of dramas. Which tradition is that in India? But they have certain conceptions of the traditions. Only fifty years old tradition they have. And then anything you tell them... You were there for this Lewes meeting, you see that girl asked Me a question. No, I was at the theater. But I couldn't manage so... Lewes, you were not there? No, I was not. She asked Me a question about the tradition part of it and I told her what was the traditional. and this was all kept a secret for six centuries. Nobody talked about Realization. You see, to them tradition means whatever people have been working out for the last fifty years extension it's tradition. It's not. On the contrary all these fifty years have ruined all the traditions, absolutely. Absolutely. No traditions at all. So fifty years back came the start of [unclear], about fifty years back when I was born. And just after My birth everything moved in such a fast way in negative side because they knew that now their end has come. So the anti God activities became extremely powerful. The day I was baptized was the fifteenth day of My birth, and there was a carriage by which we were going. You see, on these days we used to have strong horses in India. And the horse fell down, the horse went up like that, actually and the cart fell down, it broke into two and I fell inside the cart. On top of Me was the cart, on top of that fell all these things. Nothing happen to Me. See the negativity, how fast it has worked. Then, after that, I got terrible blisters on My body, all over the body. For six months I was just covered with blisters. So many were negative forces like that. I still have one or two marks in the body, one mark here. So you can imagine, how powerful these forces were like that. But My mother said that, "You were bleeding, never you cried about it". Nothing. "You were blleding and we were afraid to touch you cause all body was filled with blisters". But from nothing at all it came so they did not understand. So how negativity has worked throughout, shows that they just expedited all their forces, brought in. So these six years, as of course, Sahaja Yoga, has come out of it, but the other side is also very deep, and it has a very deep [nearing] in America. But last sixty years have been important for America also, very important. And how many changes in these last sixty years in America has taken place, how many presidents you have had? I think when I was born... When did Abraham Lincoln died? 1866, '67 just after the Civil War. And then? Then Grant, Ulysses S. Grant as I know, I suppose it. Eisenhower came. Before Eisenhower who was [president]? Truman, Mother. Truman. Truman came. I think from My birth was Truman. You see, Truman came, then Eisenhower, and it's how many? Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, I think Nixon. Johnson. Johnson, Nixon. Five, just imagine. And in sixty years time. Who was before Truman? Eisenhower? No, Roosevelt, Roosevelt. No, no, Roosevelt it is. Roosevelt. I was with Roosevelt. I remember Roosevelt was, [very well]. Roosevelt was one great person, he was very good. After Roosevelt it's going round and round. This Reagen is, he has no vision, he has no hail, feelings, nothing. You see to combat Russia, you must have people like Mahatma Gadhi. See, [you need] the power of human beings you see. Not people like Reagen, not like that, nor this Mrs. Margaret Thacher. You need people like Mahatma Gandhi to fight these. To fight a sword you must have a shield, proper shield, not a sword. And if you could produce someone like Abraham Lincoln now, you can go very high. But that one also, Abraham Lincoln is another great blessing they had, what a real blessing. There was only one road somewhere very far-fetched I saw once, in his name. Nothing else I saw. I mean once a statue I saw of Abraham Lincoln. And he was the greatest man you could think of. And even greater than Jawaharlal Nehru or anyone because, he had such great conceptions and such great ideas about freedom and all. What about these days Reagen and all? I mean imagine a cinema actor. English would not accept that at least. Of course, even Margaret Thacher is petty trader sort of a person. But, Reagen I just don't understand. There didn't seem to be much choice from the another one. There didn't seem to be much choice just because of damage of Jimmy Carter. That's true. There is no other choice. First the Jimmi Carter was wrong also. That's like stepping down one after another. So between them two what to do? But you have such a great country, you have such great feelings. You have only these two clowns there to voted for? What I am saying, why not bringing out some great people? People with ideas, people with higher thinking. Or you cannot beat Russians otherwise, unless and until you drop Reagan. You have to tell them all these bad things. Then Russians can't talk. Mother, there is such a show business attitude towards everything. They have no, they don't take it seriously. Even the West, with the Indians and they just make movies out of it. They never see the reality. Is it, is it because they harm their roots? Oh, you must have leaders who are visionaries, you see, those who have bigger ideas. Otherwise how are they leaders? Leaders must have some big ideas. You see the leader's schedule is that a leader will never tackle small problems of the followers but give them problems, "All right, solve this. Solve this problem." We have to do, now I have to go to America, now tell Me what am I to do. That's how you should lead people. Put their mind into it. Instead of that you put your mind into their smaller problems, you see. Finished. Do you think Mother that it's maybe because they, they don't feel their own roots, they don't feel their own worth, that they?... Well, you see, it has an advantage that also because if they don't feel their roots they should think of much higher things. Because deep rooted people can be cracked you see, conditioned type, very conditioned type. But they should really fly out with their wings. Instead of that, that is floating here and there. Actually those who have no roots should fly out, isn't it? I mean those who have roots, the birds are higher than the trees, aren't they? Yes. And I had that feeling about, because if you read Abraham Lincoln you do feel "isn't that sahaj?" Really he was talking of golden age I think. Was a new country. Absolutely. And the newness, and the new ideas, and all that, it's all brought down, just like that, collapsing type. Now, say, French, very deep rooted, now where are they going? Horrible. They hate everyone, very big headache they are. I tell you, wherever there's a French, you say... in the diplomatic... No, no, you are a yogi. He's a yogi now, he's a yogi. But it's a fact. You ask him, it's not a fact? That's true Mother. You see, for nothing at all they create a problem and in diplomatics services, ah... This is the time? They create problems after problems. What is it? I have to talk there. Then you should eat Mother. But I'll sleep like a log of wood if you give me all that. It's just seaweed and [unclear]. All right. All right, it seems that it is quite big... That's fish. It looks so nice, you can't imagine. Which is the seaweed? It's the black underneath, is the seaweed. It's that? All right. And that's the fish. Yes. And this is sunflower and sesame seeds. That's all, Mother. Then I will have like this. You see that. Just like this. You got the seaweed. Yes. I'll see with this bite little bit. Fine. Yes. Excellent. You said this is Chinese? Japanese. Japanese? Seaweed. Oh, horrible Japanese are. They can't make like this. They just can't make that. This Chantal has told me how to make it. Chantal has done? She, she said how to make it this morning. Very nice, I tell you, it's very, very nice. And the fish is very good, too. Pamela is the one who made it or she has made it? I made it Mother, but Chantal told me how to make the seaweed. What did you do with the fish? Just baked it. In the oven. Just baked it? Yes. Remarkable. What else you have? Mushroomss? Mushrooms, carrots, onions and that's all. A little bit of [tomato] sauce and ginger. And there's butter also. A little bit of ghee. I kept at minimum. Little bit. A little bit ghee. Ghee. Did You like this ghee? Very good. Excellent. You must eat nice ovened. And I should find out about this shop in London. What shop you were saying? Diwali shop, yes, Mother. You get seaweed there? I don't know. Where do you you get seaweeds? Neal's yard. Neal's yard. You can get it in the yard. Chantal's work place Mother. Should I get it for You? Oh, I'll ask Chantal to come and use My home how to do it. I never knew seaweed it was so nice. I never knew that it was so nice. I thought that Japanese eat everything so... She works in a health, health trade, does she? She works in a diary, Mother. She makes the cheese and yogurt in the diary. Dairy? You were doing something else, that was he? You were not collectively doing that sort of thing. I've met Paul there who introduced me to You at the meeting. Oh, I see. Whom did you meet? Paul Dante. Paul. Winston told Me something. I used to think that was, Covent Garden was beyond the river. That day, first day when I went there I knew it was here. I've never seen it before. And that, that system or so, that clock you know, that's very interesting. And we reached there at the time when it was... Hello, how are you today? Sorry for coming late, Mother. No, it's all right. We went out. I bought some laces. Do you know there is very nice shop down, which sells all sort of past work, they sell the past. Antiques. The past for sell. Not antiques, laces and very nice... I bought for twenty pounds so many laces, you can't imagine. Laces, lace work, lace, we call, Curtains? Complete curtains, made of hand, made in hand, with thread. Can you show her? They are still in the car. They are still in the car, Mother. In which car? With Paul. Mother I wanted to give You this one, and wanted to show you what has happened because last last year in Hampstead, remember we gave You one like this and I remember how much Mother I loved it. And we had one, this one at home. For one year we've kept it and it was resting. And just quiet because it is not yet the season and everyday I was looking at it. And four days back I thought, "Ah, I think, I feel when Mother comes, it would make a flower and when I woke up this morning, this was present. How sweet it is. You know this is called like a flower of eternal in India, anand, It's called as that, Gandhiji's [bhajan]. And then when you gave Me I really looked after it. See how many there are. Yesterday I just felt, I saw little buds coming and I felt, I was sure, because Mother loves it, it would know that You are here. You see how nature works it. So sweet. So great to see. Thank you very much. Actually I think this flower I discovered only just after I started Sahaja Yoga and named it. He wanted to know how the name of the Trust which was not very definite like Sahaja Yoga but something, little ambiguous I should say, so I set down like the Life Eternal, came into Life Eternal, you see. And, in marathi translation, hindi trasposed, anand jeevan. Then, after that, one day I discovered this flower, some people had brought. So I asked, "What is this flower called here?" They said, "It's called as the flower of eternal, anand". It has tremendous fragrance. But it's Indian flower after all. But the best part is most of your flowers are not fragrant. Nature works the knowledge details, knowledge details. And so many things I tell you now. In America I am going, the man who is going to helps us is dr. Marva. He says that he knows many people here and he will arrange a TV and everything, in Los Angeles. And see now, he's become the Mare of Los Angeles. Oh, great. What help we get. But despite all that as you told Me about that many [crawling in], despite all that, human beings are the ones who will get this done. Whatever we may try, God has find His level best, to do this and to do that, everything. Same thing in New York. There was one dr. Lanjeevan whom I met and he wanted Me, somehow or another to talk to doctors and all that. But he said, "I don't know, I feel they don't listen to me and all that". And he became the chairman, chairman of all the practicing doctors of New York, that association. But then he refused to do anything for Me. And next year lost his job, got into trouble, everything he had. But he became the chairman and refused to do anything for Me. Then he had problems. So nature, even God's help, everything is perfect. You can't blame it. The earnestness of Sahaja Yogis, their desire, to get so many to Sahaja Yoga. Everything is there. But somehow the negative forces are so active, that human beings you see, they can't see things through. It's very sad. What's going to happen to all these people? They don't know they will go to hell and hell is so horrid. There's no other way out. I mean I can go to any extent to please them, to do what they want but they must get their Realization. There's somebody who wanted to meet Me. So C.P. said, "He must come and see You. You are a saint. He's coming to see you as a saint. He should come and see You. Why should You go and see him? I said, "Baba, it doesn't matter. But if it will help Sahaja Yoga I will go and see him. I don't mind, I have no dignity, nothing. I'll just go and see the fellow if it works out for good". But no... Trying. Such help, you can't imagine. I was in Bangalore and he was a yoga teacher. And he came to Me and he started to talk and as usually he became rather rude. He said, "But why should you say that You have got Realization? Why should You say that You can raise the Kundalini?" I said, "I never say". Because one of his assistants, had come to Me so I said, " I've never told her". She knows about Me, so many people know. Ask her. At that time only who comes in, is the Secretary of the President of India, whom I have cured. He just jumped on him. He said, " You are a very rude and arrogant fellow". What do you mean by saying such things to Her? Do you know what She has done, who is She? Who are you? Why should you ask such a question? He just jumped on him. Very rude and arrogant person. What do you mean by saying these things? What authority you have to say such things to Her? Do you know She's cured our president. I've seen it with my eyes. She's cured one man and I've seen it. It was remarkable because we, form was very interested itself, doesn't matter. But there is a beautiful church and when you go through the church you have to go down, and there you find, there is a little statue, of Mother of Christ. The face is exactly like Mine. Is put there. And the story about it, that two children who were...
