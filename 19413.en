Conversation with Sahaja Yogis about Portugal, 1980

Shri Mataji: But they don’t know cooking they said.Sahaja Yogi: They know a little bit. Ricardo knows a little bit of it.Shri Mataji: Does he know you are his side?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, he knows.Shri Mataji: Then that really is very, very, they are very much playing there.[About the baby] Now, she’s singing. We should not show that we are paying attention to her, otherwise becomes self-conscious.You didn’t think that that can please children, very little things there.

Then I saw Portugal is like that, I felt maybe the over-industrialized countries may become like that only.Sahaja Yogi: All alike.Shri Mataji: You see, this unemployment, and these are not very good signs for any country. That’s how it starts. It started the same way in Portugal. People got unemployed, and they’ve got out of their country. Now out of the, I don’t know, six million people in Portugal there’s only one million people they only think about, left. All the rest are out. And the proportion is much more, I think.Sahaja Yogi: In Brasilia, in Sao Paolo or Brasilia, that is a city from Brazil, there are more Portuguese than in our whole country.Shri Mataji: That’s it.Sahaja Yogi: More than in Portugal and in France too. They don’t want Portuguese anymore. No one, nobody wants Portuguese. That reputation we have, very bad. In France they hate, they hate us, and in Brazil, they make jokes about Portuguese people. They don’t like us. Portuguese people don’t take bath, they say.Shri Mataji: Don’t take?Sahaja Yogi: Don’t take bath when they work in France and things like that. They say about us.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: They say about us that we don’t wash ourselves. Workers are not used to take baths and things like that. They don’t like it.Shri Mataji: French people say so?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, and it’s real.Shri Mataji: Do they take baths, French?[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.Shri Mataji: Oh.Another Sahaja Yogi: It’s racialism Mother, just racialism.Shri Mataji: Portuguese are much more clean than French are. What are they talking?Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.Shri Mataji: Horrible dirty people. No morals, nothing, all bathrooms. That’s why they have this perfumery.No need to say that about Portuguese, sometimes I can’t believe it. All racialism, that’s what it is.

That way, Americans are the only people who are American- really we should say, take baths in India. That’s true. They are very clean and, but otherwise everywhere, the whole of Europe is just the same. Worst is France, worst.Sahaja Yogi: The worst.

Sahaja Yogini: A lady on the phone, Mother. She wanted the Harlem Globetrotters.[Laugher]Another Sahaja Yogi: She wanted to find out about the Harlem Globetrotters Mother. They are an American basketball team. And she thought this was the Brighton center. Only it’s Sahaja Yoga center.Shri Mataji: Really? For the Globetrotters?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: You must put a- can you put a sign board here?Sahaja Yogi: Of course.Shri Mataji: You better put. You should really pay for it.Sahaja Yogi: We were not sure Mother because it’s a rented accommodation, and they may get funny about it. But we are going to tell them.Shri Mataji: You ask them.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.Shri Mataji: You ask the lady.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.Shri Mataji: If she agrees.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother

[Hindi conversation]Shri Mataji [to the baby]: Ha, where is the table lamp? Where is the table lamp?

These are made in England you know. Not Italy.Shri Mataji [to the baby]: Ha, that’s it, very heavy.

They also illtreat Italians very much, in a way, don’t you think so, Pedro?Pedro: Yes.Shri Mataji: These people. And C.P. was telling Me that some were there in Norway and Sweden and they were given lower wages than the local people and, for Italians.Pedro: Yes.Shri Mataji: And you can’t do under international laws. You have to give the same wages, you see. And there were some-Shri Mataji [to someone passing]: May God bless you.Some underhand things, they used.Shri Mataji [to someone passing]: May God bless you.So that is all racialism.Pedro: But in France they don’t like Italians. In France they don’t like Italians. They treat them very, you know.Shri Mataji: Even, even France?Pedro: Yes! France don’t like Italians.Shri Mataji: What do the French think of themselves?Pedro: Oh, that they are the best.[Laughter]At this time, one French man must arrive here.Pedro: Well, their Laurent is the best.[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: It’s very wrong. Now when I heard I was surprised at. Even internationally it is accepted that you have to treat everyone the same way. But that’s one point I must say about Americans, really, they don’t have so much of racialism. They have only for blacks and whites but otherwise they don’t have. Even blacks and whites it is not so much as we see it in England. Not so sharp. They have crossed that, quite a lot. They are very cosmopolitan. That’s something creditable to them. In America, you’ll find all races assemble, all kind. Indians are treated very well. Not the way they are treated in England, Indians. Italians, also. So many Italians have shops.Shri Mataji [to the baby]: Yes. Now you make some tea for Me? Make some tea for Me. I hope it’s not too heavy for children. Op! Did it hurt you? Let’s see. Very sturdy and good.

But Italians are such craftsmen and such artists. What do they think of themselves? French.Pedro: I don’t know Mother. Maybe they are jealous, because Italians when they work, they are very clever, with the hands and-Shri Mataji: With the hands, with art. And with paintings.Pedro: Yes, designing, for designing they are very good. The quality also of all these things, are very good quality.Shri Mataji: And even today it is good.Pedro: Yes, yes.Shri Mataji: I don’t know why, why French have this kind of a-Sahaja Yogi: Because they import Mother. The Italians can furnish better achievements for the French just don’t like it.Shri Mataji: That’s it. Jealousy.Sahaja Yogi: Yeah. All, all salesmen in France, they sell more Italian products than French products.Shri Mataji: No doubt.Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] It is, because it is cheaper there. And the French, you know, don’t like that because it doesn’t go to their business.[Laughter]Shri Mataji: Yes.

Shri Mataji [to the baby]: Where is the cover? There’s a little cover there, she’s trying to put. How they [children] are changing little things, you see. I wish human beings were like that, so simple.

You see, our Prime Minister’s daughter in law is an Italian girl. You know that?Sahaja Yogi: No, I didn’t know.Shri Mataji: And her husband, you see now, is - Indira Gandhi always thinks that she should make her children the Prime Ministers, you see, she thinks it’s her father’s property. So, now she’s trying to put him up as a Prime Minister. His wife is an Italian lady. Sonia, her name is Sonia.Sahaja Yogi: Sonia.Shri Mataji: It’s an Indian name, Sonia. I don’t know what it means in Italy?Sahaja Yogi: No, it’s a name. They also- Sonia, I don’t know what it means but they are people’s name is Sonia. But in Italy, they are giving rather international names like that, no?Sahaja Yogi: In France too. We have Sonia in France.Shri Mataji: It’s Indian name. Sonia is Indian name, actually. See, like our Sonu, now, her name is Sonali and we call her as Sonu and out of love we’ll call her Sonia. Out of love, you see, like that.Just like that. But that is now taken there like that, Sonia. I was surprised, it’s an Indian name. Sahaja Yogi: Or, our Cinzia. In Italy there’s a name they give a lot, Cinzia.Shri Mataji: This must, this must be Chinese.Sahaja Yogi: Cinzia. So, a lovely little girl, her name is Cinzia.Shri Mataji: Cinzia, that’s not Indian.Another Sahaja Yogi: We have a Cynthia here.Shri Mataji: Must be from Cynthia.Sahaja Yogi: Ah, Cynthia!Shri Mataji: Must be from Cynthia. That’s maybe Chinese also. Cinz and all these words are from Chinese.Like, you see, to make it sweeter we call it “a” like that. Like to the daughter, we call her, say, Betini is daughter, but to sweeten it, “Betia”.

Shri Mataji [about the baby]: Now quite friendly. Not feeling shy so much. Hum, take one more.[Hindi]. Hum, just have it. Now, I’ll put in the mouth. Ah, ah, ah. What a shyness, that suddenly it come upon them. Now you must give me bunch otherwise.Sahaja Yogini: Paula, Paula is making.Shri Mataji: All right. Or I can do it. You see what I, listen, keep it. I’ll come back and have. Sahaja Yogi: No, I think it’s ready soon, Mother.Shri Mataji: Is it ready? It’s all right. Otherwise don’t cook.Sahaja Yogi: It’s so much ready Mother.Shri Mataji: Otherwise I can come back and have. I’m not in a hurry, at all.

So, you have to little bit educate Me about America.[Laughter]How to tackle the America.Sahaja Yogi: I’ll do everything I can.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: I’ll do everything I can.Shri Mataji: Now you just tell Me one thing. Now say, take it like this, when you came to Sahaja Yoga what impressed you, how you came you see, what was your psychological barrier? Let’s see that. Because, you see, that’s how I can tackle them.What do you say?Sahaja Yogi: I think it was the intellectual sort of- connected with the things that I needed before, with my preconceptions about what Realization was, wasn’t, and what it meant to be Realized. what I actually felt.Shri Mataji [to the baby who felt down]: All right, all right, doesn’t matter, doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter.Sahaja Yogi: So, it was about a week, you know, [inaudible] then I realized that, I couldn’t compare it with anything, and I couldn’t judge it with anything because it’s-.Shri Mataji: Come here. Come here. It’s a good idea to understand it that way.You see because Sahaja Yoga has many, many aspects and many you see things are, but to whom it will appeal what is we should try to find out, isn’t it? Now, what intellectual side of Sahaja Yoga appealed to you? First of all.Sahaja Yogi: Well, it didn’t relate to the things I knew.Shri Mataji: Knew already.Sahaja Yogi: But from the experience that I received, I knew it must be something, by which I judge other things by that, rose and judged Sahaja yoga what I did before, because nothing else has given me,Shri Mataji: This thing,Sahaja Yogi: That thing, the thoughtless awareness.Shri Mataji: So then, how should I proceed with them? Should I tell them that, if I tell them say, for example, that nothing you can relate it to, whatever you have known so far. Will they be happy to know that?Sahaja Yogi: That, that should be a good thing to say.Shri Mataji: They would.Sahaja Yogi: It would appeal to me anyway but I mean, that’s just me.Shri Mataji: I mean it must because that would make you think at least that, "I have to seek something new. I mean something different". The newness of it, that may appeal?Sahaja Yogi: Yes. The idea that I had trouble with, was that it’s the only the way to do it, cause I had all these ideas to do other ways, different.Shri Mataji: Why this only?Sahaja Yogi: It was sort of things I followed, you know, sophisticated and modern staff, and all other stuff. And I think I had been limited to one thing, cause at first, it was how to deal with.Shri Mataji: Accept that there’s only one way of doing it.Sahaja Yogi: That would, that seems it would be a difficult thing for most people in America. Shri Mataji: But why, the basic reason, they want to have many things because, see, the choice, a choice, they want to have a choice. That’s a very ego feeling, you see, because, as I told you, that in America if you go, you must better ask them how to open the tap. If you just try to open the tap, and you may find you to a swimming pool. So, I mean they have all different taps, styles, they’ll have different door knobs, different, the opening style different, everything different. So, this choice business, you see. But there is no choice with Divine. It’s already decided. But that, they find it difficult to accept, I think.When it is selling, when it is selling, then you can have choice. But when somebody’s giving, how can you have choice? But they can’t understand giving, because that is also not related to what you have known so far. You have never known giving.[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: AlmostShri Mataji [about feeding the baby]: Still going in.Sahaja Yogi: It’s like the feeding of the Five Thousand, Mother.[Laughter]Shri Mataji [about the baby]: Can you believe it?Sahaja Yogi: Believe Mother, yes, we can. Twenty-one.Shri Mataji: Now, take it. So much.Sahaja Yogi: Twenty-one Mother.Shri Mataji: Really?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: You were all wondering. Hop!Sahaja Yogi: We thought there was a hole in the pot.[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: So many things happen like that, little, little things, you see.We had this Sahasrara program. And for that, you know, they decided a very far-fetched thing. You had to go to an absolute wild place, which you are going to have this time when you will go to India. And you had to go through a, ply through a, about hundred yards of sea to go to the other side of an island. And there is open sea the other side.So, we went down. And they said, "We have to do the cooking. So, what should we do?"So, the boys, you see, in India, are hopeless absolutely, they don’t know how to do anything whatsoever. Modi and her brother, and Mr. Pradhan and all these people, they said, "Now tell us how to do this, something cooking, simple, Acha [good], some sort of a pulao, rice pulao". I said, "All right".While we were driving in the car, you see, I told them how to do it. I told them, "Take now. For how many people? " It was for, they said, about three hundred people. "Three hundred people? Now you have never touched it, you don’t know how to cook". They said, "We’ll tell somebody. There’s a cook coming out".

So, in the car I told them for, for three hundred people, how much rice, how much ghee, how much masala, how much everything, all that I told them in weight. In fifteen minutes, I told them how to make it, everything. And, then, when we went there, it was such a perfect pulao, you can’t imagine. Such a miracle! And everybody said, "We have never eaten such a pulao. Who has made this and how it has worked out?"The cook had never done it that way, you see. And there were ten things to be put and at least six, seven masalas to be put, this has to go there and so many things! It’s such a kichiri. That is called like "Ravan bhat", means the, as Ravana had ten heads, you see, like that, it was the rice.It came out so perfect and so tasty and so fragrant! Of, I don’t know, it was such a miracle for three hundred people. And they were four hundred people. And the whole, I mean the masala has to be absolutely perfect for that size. And what they did, they went to the market, they ordered, "Give us so much, so much, so much, so many kilos, so many kilos, so many kilos, all right". And they gave it to the cook, "So, this is the recipe, just try". The whole thing worked out absolutely perfect.
