After this joyous ending I don’t know what to say. I was just enjoying the beauty of this rippling joy.
Something which cannot be described, you see. It is so spontaneous and so beautiful, the feeling of oneness. Like an ocean, ocean of enjoyment. You see all the waves, and the ripples, just I can’t believe that such beautiful things can happen to human beings. They are with such closed minds normally.
I was watching the match because you were thinking of the match (laughter). I found it did not create love, it did not create oneness, on the contrary people developed kind of a very great aggressiveness. Apart from that aggressiveness, it was a kind of a hatred for the other party, I mean, I was wondering this match is played for what? It’s a sport, you see, and the sport of love is this – where we all become one, we don’t try to find faults with others, we don’t aggress others. Just enjoy everybody’s rhythmic movement of enjoyment. This is so peaceful, so joy-giving.
While if you watch the match – I’ve been watching Myself sometimes, and I feel such hatred is emitting out of them. So, because the whole thing is now money-oriented. If it is money-oriented, it becomes a kind of a very aggressive game. In anything – in tennis, or this.
In our times, whatever sports were played, were out of joy, we at least enjoyed them.
But what you find, neither the spectators nor the players are really enjoying it, because they take one side. Now, if you are from Holland, you take Holland side, another one is from Belgium, you play from Belgium side. At least this kind of a combination should not have been there, because they are so close! You see, supposing Holland loses or Belgium loses: they will start fighting among themselves, very easy to fight, it’s across the border!
They could have made these games much more enjoyable if they had, really had, as was said, teams which are selected from all over the world, from different, different places. That would have been much better. But when I see the way they kick the ball, every time they kick the ball, the ego goes “tac” (Shri Mataji makes a gesture with Her hand like going up). Another they kick the ball, ego will go (laughter).
It's a very dangerous game, but normally it should not happen, normally it should not. If a child kicks the ball, he doesn’t develop a hatred. But because of this money orientation, this kind of a – you can say a maya, that people get lost, and they start hating each other for that money that they are going to get.
While our sport is love-oriented. It’s compassion-oriented. Actually the love, to enjoy this Divine love is the greatest blessing.
And I’m so very happy to see that all of you have been enjoying it. Money orientation comes when you are living with falsehood. Like you have seen so many false gurus and people, they are so money-oriented. They don’t bother anything about compassion or love.
They suddenly start thinking that they can befool all the people. Here there is no befooling, but enlightenment, openness, awareness. To feel your Self and enjoy your Self.
It's so nice to see so many of you, My children, dancing like this, so beautifully, in such rhythm. I mean, the way you are making qawwali also shows how global you are becoming. Can you imagine these Belgians and these Hollanders, Dutch people would ever sing a qawwali? (Laughter and applause)
And they composed it! And then they put the tune to it, and sang so well, in complete rhythm and in tune. Normally I’ve seen the people from the West cannot sing anything in tune much for a longer time, afterwards they go out of tune. So I was surprised there. And they are not professionals.
And what we call the alap, and taan, that was done by our Shri Ganesha here sitting, was wonderful! I was amazed how could they take out these beautiful notes – what we call swaras – it’s really amazing how you people have really absorbed the essence of beauty of music also from all over the world.
Your Cabella is of course filled with love and affection, no doubt. But it’s everywhere I’ve felt the same thing. Whether it is Holland, Belgium, India – such love, I don’t know what I’ve done to you, that you are so beautifully enjoying yourself and others in such a simple manner.
It’s something really very beautiful, I must congratulate the organizer. I was surprised at you, and, very much surprised the way you did the whole thing, news and all that, and the way you sang also. All of them have done such good thing.
Moreover, the composition of the Spanish people was also very remarkable, you see. First I used to see Spanish dances, I always felt it’s a very sensuous type. I never felt that it had this beauty of expression of Divinity.
But now I find they have that Divine understanding of rhythms. And the way they were playing, you see, it’s the - only the Divine joy was emitting through them.
Otherwise, it’s nonsensical to do things which are degrading to us.
Normally if you find, in the West, when people join together, whenever they join together - they become collective, they just start thinking of something destructive.
Either they will go for say, so-called drinks, or for some sort of a drugs also, Holland is full of it. Drugs or even beating each other, calling names, abusing, this, that. I don’t know why this tendency is there when they get collective. But in our collective, we become so beautiful that we start singing the praise of the Divine. It’s something never heard of, I tell you.
I’ve seen people who go to church also, after fifteen minutes half of them disappear. Then afterwards the thing is over, they come and say: “What a boring thing it was, you see, fed up with this, that”. And some people are just flirting with women, or women are flirting with men... There is – I never saw them with such purity that they were enjoying their Ganesha principle.
It’s really remarkable how you all have changed. Very, very remarkable.
And I specially feel for Holland, where I’ve been long time back, and I was surprised at them the kind of things they used to do, in their fields and things. I could not believe it, that they didn’t think of Divine love so much as they should have, because they were all farmers at that time. But they were very much busy with making money, how to get from Japan, from this, that. Every person that time, I was surprised, was just busy how to make money.
And they didn’t know much, also. When we went there, they put a Pakistan flag on our table (Shri Mataji laughs, laughter). We told them: “We are not Pakistanis”. “Oh, not Pakistanis? Then what are you?”. I said, “We are Indians”. “All right”. So they brought another flag, which was not Indian flag also (laughter). I was surprised, they didn’t know anything! And they didn’t know why this kumkum is there, nothing of the kind.
They were very good at making cheese, and butter, and things like that, but specially their flowers.
It always happened that whenever I went there, specially the beginning it was hundred years or something of gardening, or whatever it is, I saw the most beautiful flowers in Holland. Living with these flowers only, it’s really I was thinking, “What a place it is. It’s a Heaven on Earth”.
But then, when I saw the people, they never tried to feel the beauty of the flowers.
They only tried to feel how much it will cost, how much they’ll be selling it, what country they’ll be selling.
So, this new dimension into which you have come, is so subtle, and so beautiful, it’s such transformation. Because I’ve seen those days also and I see you here, I’m really, absolutely flabbergasted. I don’t know what to say, I just don’t know. It is such an achievement on your part, really, that you have become so pure, so beautiful, so wise.
You are growing very fast. I know Spain has few sahaja yogis. Spreading Sahaja Yoga is not the point. Going deep into Sahaja Yoga is - that’s what really. If I go to Russia, I can get thousands of people there. If Spanish people are deeper than others, that is much better. Going deep into Sahaja Yoga is much more important than to spread it.
Just go on spreading to all kinds of people is not going to help us much. What you have to now know, (is) that we must have very, very deep people who will join with us.
Also one must remember that there are very few places in the Heaven. So how can you get all kinds of animal, beastly people into Sahaja Yoga?
We have to understand that people who are deep, who are really the instrument of the Divine, and that they are extremely loving, compassionate, not showing off, not trying to do something that is ugly, according to Sahaja Yoga.
It’s all has to be very beautiful relationship with each other, helping each other, understanding each other, and also enjoying each other.
We have here people from all over the world, always we have them. But you don’t feel that way. You feel the whole global community that we have from all over is great.
Next is our Guru Puja, where lots of Russians are also coming. I must say Russians are very deep sahaja yogis, in such a short time.
I mean, you all are deep, very deep, but in such a short time they have become deep is a great, very great thing that they have become so deep in such a short time.
Whatever is the reason, what we have to understand, that anybody who wants to be enjoying it deeply from the heart, has to become mature. And then only this enjoyment becomes complete.
I’m very happy today to see you all here enjoying this music and enjoying all that was created by these three countries. So beautiful.
May God bless you all.
Thank you very much.

(Aside conversation:
Shri Mataji: So now the bhajans, you could have ... Is that one or just...?
Guido: Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: How many bhajans?
Guido: Whatever You say.)

Shri Mataji: They want to sing some bhajans. So I think we’ll have an interval for about five minutes or so, or ten minutes, whatever it is. And then we could have the bhajans.
What about your food? (Laughter)
Forgotten about it.
We could have it for one hour more, some bhajans, all right?
May God bless you.
Till then you arrange, I’ll just come. I’m sorry...
