1985-0518. The Interview was recorded in the Pichini ashram the day before the Ganesha puja 1985. It was an interview to be passed later on in a private TV

Shri Mataji: You can remove this.

Gregorie: He will also a bit too mysterious. Unclear (Greudo), So, listen Laura you can sit on that.

So, Shri Mataji, the idea is the following is that I would perhaps just introduce a little bit the thing and then I would ask you the question of the theme of the relationship of motherhood and spirituality. Because this is to feed an emission of about twenty minutes that we are paying unclear() which would be on the kennels. After that Alcendra is ask, she will just tune in at some point to ask some questions on education and children at the end.

Female: We would like to ask some questions on education of children in India

Shri Mataji: (Shri Mataji’s chair edge is on some cloth) I am sorry, did I do?

Gregorie: Sorry Shri Mataji, you are sitting on ... Sorry.

Shri Mataji: Is the door closed?

Is the door closed over there?

Shri Mataji: unclear (Other closed), put heater. Somebody has to help Daniya little bit to bring her things down.

Gregorie: Well interesting to have the opportunity to talk about something so extraordinary as Sahaja Yoga. Unclear() fascinated me from the very beginning is that in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing which has to be accepted which is not based on reality of experience and everybody knows that all the inner ways to reality have been explored by various studies for instance in the dove wants to speak about unclear (Ying and yung) that is one has to discover within oneself a dimension which is complimentary to the one in which we live and being a man I always have been wondering what it would be like to discover the feminine part of myself in spiritual science and sahaja yoga is in a very unexpected in a very beautiful way providing the answer to this kind of enquiry. It is indeed very important in the teaching of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi to confirm that we are containing within ourselves the ying and the yung that is the male and the feminine aspect. Moreover Shri Mataji now teaching precise is that the feminine qualities are very important for our own ascent and Shri Mataji Nirmala devi being Herself a Woman, a Mother, a Grand Mother, SHE has been a House Wife, SHE has been knowing all the aspects of a women’s concrete life that no one is better qualified than HER to bring to our attention what is this relationship which is so mysterious in some way between the femineity and spiritual ascent. So perhaps by a way of introduction I should say that the link between the femineity and the spiritual ascent has to be found in motherhood and Shri Mataji May I right away ask you

what is the meaning of Motherhood in the spiritual ascent of a normal human being like me?

Shri Mataji: It’s absolutely Primordial. It comes from the Primordial being that we are all created out of the power of God Almighty, as we say there is the God Almighty and there is His beloved Son and the third one, we call it as Holy Ghost. Now nobody knows anything about the Holy Ghost that it is the Primordial Mother who is the power of God.

Gregorie: Well, but the Primordial Mother is the power of God. God is perhaps very near as the saints say though for most of us, He seems sometimes to be very far. So how do we discover the Primordial Mother as a personal reality. It’s a question I asked You in a hypocritical way because I know the answer of that.

Shri Mataji: Within us in our being the God Almighty is represented in our heart as the Spirit and within us is the Primordial Mother-the Holy Ghost represented as Kundalini. When the meeting or the yoga or the union between the two actualizes it has to happen, it’s a happening. When it actualizes, then only you can get the experience of the Divine force of the Divinity which is surrounding us and thus you move one step forward towards God understanding.

Gregorie: and I should perhaps say here that in this experience Shri Mataji plays a very unique role. She sees so often that sahaja yoga is not seeing anything, is not having visions, is not understanding sahaja yoga is becoming. Becoming ourselves actually. But everybody knows that in the brain all that becoming really takes place for me was without any doubt. The result of my first encounter with Shri Mataji. It was perhaps first encounter of the third kind and

Shri Mataji how is it that just smiling at somebody you have the power to awaken the Kundalini? You have this kind of catalytical faculty to give them the key to themselves?

Shri Mataji: It’s nothing great or fantastic as you see everyday these things happening. If you place a seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts without any effort. The Mother Earth has got the quality, the nature of Mother Earth is such that she can spontaneously awaken any seed into life. I have that quality within myself. Naturally nothing great I have it that’s all. I have not achieved it. It’s there. So, I don’t think it’s something fantastic. But the first question you have asked that when you understand it by your brain then how is it you get it as a experience by brain whatever you understand you understand through your limited mind. Which is beyond you. It’s not within. But when the experience takes place, you really evolved and your central nervous system gets a new dimension and you get a new consciousness, new awareness. Which is called as Bodha. Or in Sanskrit it’s called as ‘Vidh:’. From there the word Veda has come, and from Bodh Buddha has come. The one who has got the Bodh means the feeling of the universal power of God on your central nervous system is the Bodha. Is not what you understand through your brain, through your reading, through your discussions but it’s a built-in process on your nervous system.

Gregorie: and again Shri Mataji wants that this Mother within us which is dissonate this energy of Kundalini when She gives us our second birth because one can born only from the mother. She does it because She feels the great Mother in you like unclear (gandha) Mother and then we also develop these qualities which are the quality of motherhood of compassion of patience of gentleness and

is it possible Shri Mataji that through this process one can unclear() us the transformation of the behavior of great number of people. So, that society benefits from all this. So that is not only an individual process. Is this possible?

Shri Mataji: Of course. It is the epitome of your evolution, is the evolution of all the human beings. And those who want to seek it can have a higher state of awareness in which you get complete integrated where the motherhood, the fatherhood and the childhood all these three combines. As the child you become innocent, as the mother you become the compassionate, and as the father you witness. That’s how all these three qualities combine in you, and you become a different person when you start feeling that you are the part and parcel of the whole. And when it happens it is not a feeling of your mind, but is the feeling on your central nervous system. so that you can feel others on your fingertips.

Gregorie: So, in other words these holy trinity which was I should say rather difficult to understand of a Father, a Son and a Holy Spirit, now it’s getting more precise the mother. This they correspond to state of consciousness within ourselves. But how do we develop than the quality which Christ said we should have the quality of the child so that we can recognize the mother and the father.

Shri Mataji: It is existing within you. The child quality – the innocence is existing within you. Only some clouds have come over it. Which are all thrown aside, and you become the child. When a person has not seen the mother, he feels lost and think that he is not protected, he has nobody to look after, he weeps and cries. When he sees the mother, he recognizes that Oh, he has the mother.

Gregorie: Actually, a spontaneous and when we look around us is really the one quality that is missing. Everybody play games, I mean everybody many people, many people are fake, this capacity of just being like children we have lost it. I have visited Shri Mataji countries in the East, I was in Nepal, I was in India and the people were so direct, so one with what they felt in the heart, what they felt in the brain, and the way they behave.

So, is it possible through sahaja yoga to regain the spontaneity and what is this spontaneity that we are really missing in the west?

Shri Mataji: Spontaneity comes from innocence. And innocence is a quality all the time within us. Only thing that there are some clouds which are covering it and are not manifesting the innocence within us. But when the Kundalini raises, She wipes out all those clouds and all those hurdles and we find the light of innocence coming through spontaneously.

Gregorie: I wish that we could have the quality to recognize these qualities when they appear. Because it is a fact that what you have given in the field of spirituality since you have started in 1970 is going far beyond the level of knowledge reached even by the various scriptures there is no comparison between that you teach and what a lot of masters teach because what you teach is very friable in our central nervous system and then how it is that people have such difficulty to recognize the novelty, the geniuses but also the tremendous importance of your message. Is it that it is too simple to be understood?

Shri Mataji: No, that’s not the point. The point is that these are the days of complex advertising, and we have no advertising like that. Its very forth right understanding of reality. And it is too simple by which people have lost the way and they cannot see something straight. But they will come around. Because you suffer. When you go in the wrong direction, you always suffer and you comeback to the right point.

Gregorie: What should one give to get one’s realization? Should one pay money? Should one register in a school? How does it happen?

Shri Mataji: Oh, it is innate within you just like as I said the seed. How much do we pay to the Mother Earth? You don’t have to pay, and you don’t have to do anything, just you have to take it from the Mother Earth, that she gives you the nourishment and your Kundalini raises.

Gregorie: Is there any reason why it should take place now and not before because you say it is like seeds put in the Earth which grows, and this has taken place since centuries but this which I have been witnessing it since now a couple of years that is really thousands of people getting their self-realization. Now this has not taken place before why should it take place now?

Shri Mataji: Because in the evolutionary process, this is the time. When the reach the state of the flower then only we call it a blossom time. May be in the beginning there are one or two flowers. But you reach a point where there are many and then you get so many fruits. It matures at that time.

Gregorie: And Shri Mataji please can you tell us how or why it is that in Italy there has been such a good response compared to other European countries. I went to programs in Milano, in Rome where people would never heard about Kundalini, never heard about these things, people who have been warned against all these fake gurus came to you, kissed your hand, gave you flower while looking absolutely and enchanted and shining speaking all a unclear (grandha madhuri vinuta) how is it, what makes this county receptive to this message Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: I can only say Italians are the most sensitive people in the whole of Europe. They are very sensitive; they are very human. Others in the grab, they are at very much grabbed by machineries and other things, may be the climate I think of Italy is such that people in this climate feel balanced. I can not explain why but only I can state as a matter of fact that they are the most sensitive people.

Other Yogi: Shri Mataji I would like to ask you we have seen so many so-called gurus in the west which are used to collect rosarios and mesmerize people and like parasites. So how it is that you don’t take any money for your great job and another question finally we listen talk about the Spirit. Would you like to talk something about the nature of the spirit?

Shri Mataji: Alright, the first question I have already answered that how can you pay? I mean how much will you pay? which is love. It is love of God. Its pure love. It just works by itself. I don’t know much about money, I don’t understand. This cannot be paid for. Its something different. This is not in the market. Now about the fake gurus, I have been telling about them from 1970 from everywhere that be careful. Because I know there are so many seekers are born. In seeking they go to drugs, in seeking they go to alcohol, in seeking they go to wrong things. And then they go to fake gurus also. Because they do not do anything else. But there is the truth.

Now about the Spirit, it’s a very long subject, I can only say that the nature of the Spirt is that it is the Truth, it is the reality, it is the attention. When it comes in the attention, your attention itself becomes powerful and look at anyone you can raise the Kundalini of that person. And thirdly, it is the Joy. Joy is a quality which is absolute, it is not happiness and unhappiness. Because these two depend on ego and super ego. But joy is an absolute quality and that comes only from the Spirit.

Gregorie: Are there conditions that a man, a normal man living in the world of today with war is that we all have the stress of the work, the problems of the family

is there any special type of person which can get this? Can anybody get it? I mean what makes the difference between those who get it and those who don’t?

Shri Mataji: There are a special categories. They are called as seekers. The people who are seeking beyond. They think that they haven’t yet got what they wanted from life. They are not seeking money, they are not seeking positions, but what they are seeking they do not know. Such people are a special category, and they get realizations without any difficulties. But once we have many people realized, why not. The whole world should get it. That is not what they are here for.

Gregorie: Well, st John said in the unclear() that the elected would be unclear() 44000. I always found this elected word a very disable about because it sounded a bit elite, but I was very happy to know that you felt that John was a bit miserly and there should be many more people to get their realization.

Shri Mataji: You see what he said were elected. But elected doesn’t mean electorates are less. The ones we elect are many but elected means the one who will the job.

Gregorie : Shri Mataji, to get many people, it is very important to provide them some guidance because I found a venture running school that our children often left to very distractive influences, everybody know we have drugs in the school, we have all kind of behavior and it seems that we should also speak about children because there is the family of the father, the mother and the child. And what about the children Shri Mataji how can we give the right guidance to our children so that they can develop in themselves from the young age this readiness to open towards the deeper self.

Shri Mataji: Most of the children who will be born to you those who have got realization will be all realized souls. Also, there are tremendous flow of divinity. In that realm, in that area and I find there are lots of saints being born these days. And these are going to come as your children. But it is important that the parents must understand the deeper significance of the spirit and the effect of the bad things on the children, and they are the best to keep them out of any dangers. But as these children are realized souls, I am sure they will get out of those influences. On the contrary when they will grow, they will change all these things with greater dynamism.

Interviewer (Female): Do you think in this will change also our society through this different kind of people that will come out?

Shri Mataji: People make the society. when the people change, the society will change. And the society always bows to something that is noble. Always. In the long run. Have you ever seen the statue elected of a man who has been running after women or who has been drinking? Society does not respect anything that is not respectable. All these waves come and go away. Only the nobility, the righteousness, the higher qualities are respected. For a short time, it works out. So, the society has to change. Because it will see the noble work God is doing through you people and the society will definitely change. It has to change. We say that the whole world can bow to you but there should be the one who knows how to make them bow to you. Now a day they are bowing to something unreal. But after all they are human beings. They are the highest in the realm of God’s creation and they will definitely realize that the reality is reality.

Interviewer (Female): How should their parents behave to grow them up in such a way that they can keep the qualities like these?

Shri Mataji: In this western country, the children have the biggest problem of ego. If the parents are egoistical, then the child also become egoistical. If the mother is a hectic woman and she is all the time running up and down, the child might a develop disease called Leukemia. All kinds of problems can arise from the disturbed parents. The first and foremost thing – the adults must decide if they have to marry and have children, they have to be responsible for them and they have to behave themselves in such a manner that the children do not get any repercussion from them.

Interviewer (Female): And Shri Mataji, one other aspects, very important for the growth of the children is the school because they spent a lot of time in school and what are your suggestions about the school?

Shri Mataji: The school should be such that children should be told about the higher life and the nobler life and the children must be trained and disciplined for it. Now a days it has stopped. People do not talk of God; they do not want to talk of Spirit. Because there has been lots of artificiality in the name of God. But when you know that it is the reality, it is better to tell them openly that there is God. And you have to experience him. That’s all is the stage left. So, the children will feel confident. Normally children are aware of God and they want to talk about God, they like it. But it’s the parents by their behavior just take away their attention from that.

Interviewer (Female): Is this a secret of the joy that we see in Indian children, we see such sparkling eyes compared to ours.

Interviewer (Male): Definitely, I think (Video discontinued.,)

Shri Mataji: I think they are coming to that level

Gregorie: They were so sweet.

Another Yogi: They were absolutely adorable.
