PART 2
Yes, he has no good feeling, the is spoiled, the heart is spoiled, all the chakras are spoiled, the Nabhi chakra is spoiled. Tree chakras are spoiled and it’s the basis. It’s the basis of your Realisation that he has ruined!
Marie: Chakras [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Hum ?
Marie: [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what happens, you know. That’s the trouble. What are-
Marie: All the people want their Self.
Shri Mataji: You see, what happens, other people observe also because you h=get the power of somebody else coming in to you.
Marie: [unclear] in his power.
Shri Mataji: What’s his? What power he has got? He’s giving a spirit into you, it’s a simple thing! If you get possessed, you will get such power. You see these geniuses now. You must have heard about these prodigies. You have heard about this Shakuntala? There is one lady who can calculate, say, so many things, and this, and that. She is a possessed woman. You go and ask her mother she beats her mother.

It is a possession. By possession, naturally, if somebody possesses you, you see, you look better. Some people will even say by drinking they become better. Yes there are some people. But that doesn't mean drinking is good.

That's not your Self! Your own self must emit the power and you must know your Self and you should be able to work out yourself, that's it. Can you work out your love? How many of you? Just by movement of your hand. Just by movement of your hand, you work out your love at first. It cures you. You can love. You have the collective Consciousness that's all described in the Scriptures. You must tally with everything that has being described. Nothing is going to be wiped out from this world. They have to be completely enlightened and explained. Not a single word of the scripture.

Maybe, once or here and there, human beings have put some [unclear]. on the people, that's different. All of them are going to have some help [unsure]. The integration is going to work out inside not outside. The integration is going to work out inside not outside. You're going to be completely integrated and feeling for other what’s wrong with him, what is his problem, where he is catching [unclear].

It's not so superficial a change, that transformation. Do not be satisfied with superficial things. Ask for the real and then you will get. If you satisfied superficial, what [unclear]. at you, about yourself, I have no time.

If you are real and if you have not that responsibility of God Almighty to find you out and give you whatever is your deserving, what you want. But ask for the real, don't be satisfied with falsehood.
Don't be satisfied with falsehood. The certificate must come from within yourself, what others are saying is not important.
Sahaja Yogi: How we can know that?
Shri Mataji: That you will know through your vibrations. All right?
See now. You are today- supposing I give you a thousand pounds. And you are an Indian. You don't know what is a pound. How do you know it is a pound? It is a money that will buy something [unclear]. Work it out. Work it out., you see, see even you will see the Kundalini rising with your naked eyes. With your own hands, you will see. When you will raise your hand, you will see the Kundalini will move and you can feel this Kundalini moving. You can feel his vibrations too. You can feel his problems on your fingertips.

It has to be tallied and verified and found out. Not to be trusted this way you have to see for yourself: is it there or not? Keep yourself in it and find out. That is what is Self-knowledge is by which you know about everyone who is surrounding you, what it is, where is he, what is his problem. Not his mind, but his Kundalini you know, you know his centres. One of the centres has something to do with mind also, it is Agnya. It’s this centre. This is what you must think.

This is, supposing a person is very violent. I can give him a drug and it will make him a better person. That's not the way. That's not the way. The way is how much you stand on your own leg and understand and you become a master of it. Then you will see you will mature so fast! You yourself will know what [unclear] on the hand or nothing. You must have a new awareness, a dimension of vibratory awareness within you. This is being told by so many great souls, clearly: Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya has talked about [unclear]. Christ said, "Some power goes out of my body". These things must be found out. Otherwise, where are you running? In the wilderness?

You are not mediocre. You are great. Let the nonsensical people go and [unclear]. Not you. You are the real seekers. You have to fight it out within them. If you don't do it, you will just catch again I mean, again, you will [unclear]. The more you talk of that fellow, and the more the vibrations it will be.
Find out, pick up that. From [unclear] is there, on the right-hand side, heart

[unclear]
[unclear]
He is not discussing Agnya. The more you discuss, the more [unclear]. And you'll become an expert. I'm going to tell you all the secrets, everything. And I'm going to tell you why I say this, why do this, why do that, why do that. You can verify yourself what I say is true or not. But don't stand on my [unclear]. But you don't judge me either, that's not your right.

If you do it, maybe I can warn you. What you do is to judge yourself whatever I say, if it’s true, accept it. All right?

It's an open channel. How is it? Can you see now, yourself, now what are you worried about? The great psychologist, see this here. Now come along. Put your hands towards her. She will tell me Now these have got Realization recently, they can tell. She has got it recently. Who else is there? All of them? Even Lindsay, David, they have got it recently, they can feel, they can tell you.
He has got it recently, this last [unclear], all of them. Except for, I had only six people I was studying with them for 4 years.
Oh, they are very good.
Ah! How is he, tell me?
Sahaja Yogi: I can't [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Just now, try.
Sahaja Yogi: I feel [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Yes, correct, correct, correct. Absolutely correct! Correct mark 100 out of 100 correct. He has a liver problem. And what is your job?
Seeker: [unclear]
Shri Mataji: That's one [unclear]. It’s too much, move over.
[unclear]
Shri Mataji: That's a difficult sign. [Laughter]
Ah! See now. Better? You mean, he is going down now?
Sahaja Yogi: Cool.

[unclear]

All have touch it. All have done it. All of you are Realized, all of you. Take it from me. [unclear] All right?
You do from that side to that side. You put your hand toward me. Tell me where is the thing. Where is the thing? Nothing? Not feeling cool? Nothing.
Nothing. Agnya. Come along now, you all work, all of you work on him. Who else is not feeling the cool breeze? Are you not feeling the cool breeze right there? [Name], put your right hand on the heart, come along. You are all right? Agnya.
Now those who are not feeling the cool breeze, come inside. Those who are feeling the cool breeze, stand outside. Now those who are feeling the cool breeze, all of you work on the people who are not. Let us see how the love works out. Come along. Sit down. Now don't talk and argue, just feel and work it out. Come along now. I just take him for 10 minutes and then you’ll work it out.

Gavin, look after that. Come along, now you. She's all right, she's very good. She is all right, she is excellent. What about you? Are you feeling the cool breeze?
No? Raise their Kundalini and all of them put their bandhan. Now let's see now. They are today, they have swimming. Tomorrow you will be swimming. You are all right, you got it. You take your hands also come along. Those who are [cut in the audio]
It’s already outside?
There is no need to take our attention outside. You should take your attention to your heart inside. That's a difficult thing to take your attention there, that's why some happening has to be. Supping we all sitting there and listening to me, all right? Everybody is listening to me. But suddenly, something happens. And your attention like that. In the same way, there a happening with you and the attention is moving. But now after Realization, you can put your attention inwards. You see, our attention has come out and by putting our attention to this, or to this, what are we doing? We are making holes into our foundations; these are our foundations.

Now, I think, you must be having a photograph of me. You see it, and you see after 10 days of real Sahaja Yoga and then [unclear]
And she asked me about Yogananda. I said he was there for about 50 years, or 60 years, or more than that. He was running that ashram. Have you met any one of his disciples? Horrid, extremely hot-tempered. [unclear]

Krishnamurti, his disciples are horrid, horrid. What have you gain? I mean they say, "We are saving your cases and this and that. And you go there and get stones. And still, you say, "Why could we not do that?"
[Shri Mataji, to a seeker]
Keep it inside. Keep your right hand on the heart. Put your right, left, both.
Seeker: Yes.

Better? It’s his Agnya. Actually, which one is catching, on your finger?
Seeker: This one.
Shri Mataji: I see. Agnya is there. It is there. Watch it, watch it, watch it. Now what is he? What is he? Come here.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: Hum? Will you distribute that thing that they gave me just now and all that? You brought it? Whoever has brought it, just give them. And whatever is brought, they brought something and they want, mint or something, distribute this.
Distribute this, and open it. I’ll just take one. Even something, she brought it, for you, just come there.
All of you sit here. When the Mother is sitting before you, you must eat.
[Unclear]
Like Gavin,
Sahaja Yogini: She’s crying.
Shri Mataji: She's showing the [Bhairava, unsure] to her. She's cheating you. She knows how to do it, the job. Ah, good

There are many, it’s all right. Just put like this.
What do you say? What is her position? You tell me, you, what are the vibrations you feel like.
Seeker: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: Correct now. Did you know these things before?
Seeker: No.
Shri Mataji: You see. You are separated from yourself, that's why you know her and know yourself also.
Really? What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: All of them are within.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Right or left?
Sahaja Yogi: Left heart.
Shri Mataji: Left? Today only, I thought about left heart.
Just think that God is the ocean of compassion. He is the ocean of [unclear]. All right? He is the father.

Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: Come here. Now one thing you do, first of all, is to let him do with the TM. You go and ask them what is to be done. For one minute you go, treat them and come back.
Ask, mister Djamel come from Algeria. You can tell him.
Sahaja Yogini: Just tell him, of course.
Shri Mataji: Hum. You give it to all of them. One, one to all of them you give.

So, how are you sir? You have faith in the man who has given you nothing, nothing. Only he has given you a heart chakra [problem].
Sahaja Yogi: I find it hard to believe that he is a devil. He is such a kind man. He has never said anything to me but.
Shri Mataji: That’s why he is very cleaver, you know. You must know one thing, child. You see, this is the age of confusion. All right? [Unclear]
In these modern times, nobody's going to come and say, "I'm a monster! "
Seeker: But I feel he's a good man. I feel he's a good man. I don't know, I'm imperfect. But as far as I can feel–
Shri Mataji: I’m saying, I’ve got that cure your instrument and then you’ll get all right. [Unsure]
[Unclear conversation]

Right is all right, he’s all right on the right. This is good, excellent, very good.
