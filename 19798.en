[Marathi to English Translation]

What this lamenting and sob stories? I do not want to hear any of the whining and crying .what a crazy thing to do ,I want to laugh and you want to cry ...

We should actually be like small children .What does it mean if you are still not able to see ; even though everything seems to be visible in front  like the shining sun ?Then what should I Say? If a blind person is there then we can understand, he can’t see, he doesn’t understand. But if everything is clear like the sun, and you are right  in front of the door of joy, if one can’t enjoy then what’s wrong with you.? Everything is going above your head. It’s all old beliefs. Leave them. Once you leave them then you will find your own thing.

Whatever is bothering us, let it go out of the way , leave all old , leave all th ,station yourself in this moment .Its only a matter of getting within it .I am there to help you to achieve that. But don’t fall over on my head. If few fall on , it’s ok

Everything will be alright. It’s only Divine play. It’s not that hard, what you have to do.

I don’t want you to argue, No arguments among Sahaja yogis. If your Agnya catching, it’s catching.

If Heart is catching, it’s catching. So why there is an argument and feel bad about it? To clear the blockages then better clean them. Now if cancer is there, and doctor will tell that it is there, then would you go and hit the doctor? If the problem is there then you will say, “Clear it!” Same way if Agnya is catching, you will say, “Mother it is not possible.” If it is there, then clean that. Sahasrara has some blockages then clear them. Whatever is bad, it has to go out. This simple thing, you don’t understand? Why there is an argument or talk about it? If by just talking and listening if you clear Agnya or by doing arguments then clear it. It will not happen only with talk. It’s a matter of Love. Through Love it’s possible. You have got realization. Have you got your realization by Arguments? Or have you got your realization through your books or education? How did you get your realization? One miracle happened and in a flash you got realization.

Saint Gaganghad was saying, “Mataji how it happened, you came and everyone’s Kundalini raised?”I don’t understand. He did not give realization to anyone and thousand people are ready to give their life to fall over his  feet.. He asked me, “How many are ready to sacrifice their lives for you?” I told him, “I am ready to sacrifice life for them, why would they sacrifice life for me?” He said, “What is the use?” I said, “What the use is for you they are ready to sacrifice their lives? And how many are ready to get their realization? I have people who are ready to take realization. ” He said, “That’s your giving.” “Yes, that’s fine, but I have realized people. Show me if you have at least one who is realized.”

Thousands are going to him at his feet. “Have you given realization to at least one person?” “Mother, I will do it, when you will do it.” “After 12 years, you have still not done anything for these people. I am Mother, now please have mercy on you and be quick.”

In 1977 in Mumbai I wanted to do a big program, thinking of doing Sahaja Yoga international conference.

“For this all Sahaja Yogi need to be prepared. They are like roses”, that’s what I am thinking. You are my representative. Don’t just think about small or stay in your comfort. I have decided to reach out to America. And still, you are thinking about here. If that is not possible for you, but see what is possible for others. Just see for yourself, where you were and where have you reached. Now if you take the water of River Ganges with paper, then how would you take it? For that you need a pot. If you are not ready to take that then what I should do? That is your problem, don’t blame Sahaja Yoga. Once you have pot then you can take water from River Ganges. With a paper boat you can’t achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga. Here great people (saintly people) will come.

Now I have to tell you the good news that in London nearly 200 children are realized. One boy of 12 years of age, it’s very hard to find a boy like him. One boy of 8 years of age, a very amazing boy!

Very talented boy, he came to my feet, did not know how to stand. He was a Roman in a previous life. I asked him, “What is Mataji?” He said, “That is Holiest of Holiest name. It is all above all the names.” He was only 8 years of age. When I was coming down, He was saying everyone with anger that, “She is coming down, there is no red carpet for her.” And then he brought one red carpet from home. Then he sat down.

He has drawn some maps of all countries by his hand. Very smart boy. He said, “Mother, bless all these people.” Then he drew some strange drawing, then said this is the mind of human beings. Then he showed the place of ghosts. Drew different things. He said to bless them and, “Close this door. Many are influenced by them, are here. Close this door.” Felt like I have heard this, have different experiences. You will be surprised. If you listen to his experience then you will say, “Mother, great people, they are.” powerful people are coming.When Indian classical music was being played , they were dancing. Then I asked, “How do you understand this music?” Then they were telling me, “Mother we feel ,this is the music of heaven!”

Recently one disciple came,did you met him? He was very knowledgeable. You listen to him when he talks. He sent one letter. When did he meet me? He might have met me 8 to 10 days. Now see ,he has become a big and important officer in United Nations in Nepal. He is very educated and knowledgeable. But  all know that is not that important. Have so many experiences. See the children. on’t  anything about Kundalini, hey do it by themselves. One boy of eight years of age, with his toy gun he started to kill the negativity,tried to threaten them and started applying Sindur [red powder used for Bindi] on his faces. Two to four people were there to talk nonsense and for show off, he put them right. Some others also came to become over smart, he put them also right: with his two feet and his toygun firing he putnoise.

There is also very grand good  news that they know all about Kundalini. One boy was there and the other boy was sitting in front of him, His Vishuddhi was little blocked, he wore his shoes. I told him, “Keep him there.” He slapped for some time on his back to clear his Vishuddhi. There is no need to tell them anything, what kundalini is and what not. There are no arguments, no need to talk. One old person came and asked, “What and how it happened that small boy went down, brought 2 to 4 lemons, and started hitting with that till it gets cleared?” I saw his work was going on. He was not quiet for one minute. Everyone was meditating and he was moving around in dark, and trying to touch their Kundalini, pulling some one’s ears, nose. He was trying to cleanse them. These children will not listen [that means they are realized children].

Their parents are wrong, they are committing mistakes, but these kids are doing right things. One boy of 12 years of age said, “Mother, they are Jews, they are Christians, means those who were Followers of Christ, Jews opposed them. We are as Christians, they are like Jews, and they did the opposition. They can never recognize you, they can’t recognize you.” Then I said, “Do you recognize me?” “Yes, we can.” “Then who are you?” Then  their hands ,closed eyes ,in thoughtlessness  and meditation and silence  were trying to find it out .. Like these  there were 200 children.

Children will be spoiled as we [parents] are not complete [not responsible], we are still halfway.

In Hindustan there are more talented kids, they are very strong to correct their parents. Foreign parents teaching kids wrong things [dirty talks] create bad feelings in their hearts. After listening every time kids also are spoiled. In India it’s very different, they go against parents if they are doing something wrong. Children are getting prepared. In ten years they will be ready. Those kinds of kids will take their birth. Even you have kids in your house when they will grow, and they will stand with their power. You don’t have to teach them Sahaja Yoga, they are old Yogis, they are ours. But still, I will affirm that you Mumbai Yogis are like precious stone to build this foundation (of sahajayoga)

Sahaj Yoga is accepted and practised by the Mumbai people. Keep in mind. So please don’t waver . There is no need to waver.. And don’t get attracted by the false impression of wrong people. Keep your self-respect and self-impression. More people have come to get a cure. No need to take an impression [false praise] from them.  and strong character . These kinds of people are terribly powerful . No need to listen to anyone wrong things. Keep in mind. We are all one,children of one mother. Don’t Think negative, it’s against Sahaja Yoga. Even though if you think that some injustice has happened ( I feel really bad in my heart.) That you understand. I have given a place in my heart and . t anything wrong this  is wrong doing against the divine .So I will  ever tolerate those kinds of things].. Other mistakes /killings will be forgiven. Do you remember, there were 12 e  not getting realization! Then I just   this thing, and just on that day ,taking the base of this fight amongst you ,I gave them realization. .(or will get realised) But I will not  make people fight with each other, pick up a particular trivial issue feeling superior to others ,if you sideline others .I will not  forgive you

endured so far ?. I have a habit of a son,  He went on the cross for you all. What sacrifice   done or what did you lose,

. You can see all these benefits. Now if you want to see the benefits in the future, then keep talking of foolishness aside and go deeper. Some are very smart and peaceful  ,Very peaceful! If I by names then you will think, “Shri Mataji’s is giving importance to this person or that person.”very well .. I don’t keep anybody near to me,just to tell you all that  I am detached, truly I am detached .But you have to keep me close to you. Now you have to learn to love me. See,You are going to be so grateful and blessed and you will get so much vibrations .  God will not like it. If you don’t e  for me, you will not receive Joy . And you all know that .No matter how much I say, but Joy only flows once you develop unconditional and infinite love for me, T simple understanding [Tasa Tyacha Hisobe ahe]. God  By putting your attention anywhere you will not get anything.   fact,that is  the truth. Well,if you love me everything or else will not give anything.Now what can I do? I said, “It’s ok. They are small children.” He said, “No, it’s not accepted.” Now I am saying this with my own mouth  that my position is very different in a way that I am stepping to your door, and begging for love. Because God is not listening. I am telling you the truth. He is like that.. y , truth is truth, and that is  working out,Does anything  happen with imaginary things or thinking.? If you have thought this is not like this, or not like that, whatever is there is going to happen, it will happen. That you all have learned in Sahaja Yoga, isn’t it ?

Now how we can increase the Yogis’ number, that is the question. In Sahaja, Yoga people progress slowly. There is a  reason behind it as  they are looking at you. They might be thinking, “God saves us. We don’t want to practice Sahaj.” Sahaja yoga will expand only after looking at you people. So many times people said that, “We will establish an organization [Institution].” This type of Sahaja Yogi, that kind of Sahaja Yogi,, “Don’t do that, l.. o. They were asking why. I said, “Today he is MA and tomorrow he will behave like a donkey, today he is in the sky and tomorrow in hell. You can’t give anyone a degree. If you give a degree then it will be problematic.” Now that  I have come, tell me what you have thought, or think when you are at home, going for one month. There are 2 to 3 days of the program. And let me see what you will do. Sit in meditation for 3 days? Check in your meditation who will do ,, who will be useful, put attention on them whom you know. Your attention has great power. That attention you use it, put attention on them, and apply Bandhan, give Bandhan after going home today. God will bless you. Don’t get identified by other people, “This person lives here” or “Something wrong happened to this person.”

“What I can do for Sahaja Yoga?  person has to come, that one has to come, other has to come”,use your attention. Power is sitting in your attention. If you apply that attention to a wrong thing then it will be useless. If you apply in Sahaj Yoga then it will be nourished, “That person I have cured, another person I have cured sickness.” Sit and apply attention to them. Now don’t talk to me other than Sahaja yoga. I am not ready to hear anything else than Sahaja Yoga. Not it’s enough. “My wife has run away. My husband has run away. My child is not doing well”, I am not going to listen from Sahaja Yogis. If anyone wants to talk like this then better quit Sahaja Yoga. For those  want to feel Joy they can come here, those who want to receive the love they can come here. Those who want to get all happiness can come here. God who has kept all His grace [Sampada], if you want, then come here. Now you all are leaders. You are a leader of this  which is going to come. Your name o in  History. For this great work if you are not interested, then don’t come. I am telling you the first time, those who want to receive and stand up then come individually, don’t come from any kind of group. Now one drop becomes an ocean. If you don’t come that way then you will carry everyone’s dirt or problems. ,There will be no talks or discussions about this .I will not talk other than Sahaja Yoga,that you decide. You all are very much in a big group. I did not get so many people in any lifetime. As you are in a big number, with your help boat will sail across .. So I have a request,a prayer that  if I have loved you, then there should be no foolishness while reaping the fruit . Maturity has to come, become big-hearted, don’t act like a child, keep quiet if someone talks childish, don’t listen to them. Talk like elderly people. You have  fruit. You keep the peace, stay calm, and enjoy. Break all conditionings within you ,ving blood  will flow with joy ,happiness.and 

. Is any new person come today, keep both hands up. New people  sit in the front. Remaining can sit in back, children can sit separately. Don’t talk while doing meditation, don’t laugh, sit quiet, and don’t laugh. Keep hands like this. Now in England, so many children have increased. You have to progress. You all are great people. Slowly progress has to take place. Otherwise, you will face demotion. New people come forward and sit in the front. Now recite a regular mantra. Mr Damle you take mantra  three times. Many people have found out this mantra and it’s very effective. Now new people look at me. Look at my Kumkum.

Everyone reciting mantra collectively.
