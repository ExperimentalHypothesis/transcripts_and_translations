1985-12-25 Christmas Day, Brahamapuri, India.

So today you are here in Brahmapuri which you all wanted to come very much and the river is not so good they said but if you go little further it's very good that side.  So you have to walk a little bit more on the other side.

Today I think is a special day to tell you that Mr and Mrs [Kingaray]who have arranged this program. You know their father in law lives in [unclear] and he has been working very hard, but Mr and Mrs [Kingaray] they came here all the way to arrange this program for you. And what they told Me was very remarkable that exactly 25 years back on the Christmas Day they were married in Angapor here, and they were very much amazed and blessed that I am here on that day. After 25 ypatars it was a very big thing for us 25 years married and they brought some sweets for Me, saying that this had happened.  I was very happy to know that. So everything has great significance and as  God has blessed them [unclear] husband and wife. 18 years back, 25th  December, and they are very happy about it. 

All right, so now one has to be in a mood of enjoyment and happiness. One should not be very moody. You see the trouble is it has become a fashion also with Western people, to be moody you see. They get into this mood or that mood. It is nonsense.  It means you have no control over yourself. That sort of a thing cannot work out in Sahaja Yoga. Keep your attention in the centre and don't get moody.  Sometimes you get angry with yourself or with others. There should be some chance for the anger to run away. So now you have to be very patient and not in a way that is an exertion but an enjoyment. Patience is enjoyment. To Me it is. That's how I manage things. And you all should be very patient  with yourself.   But should not be slow.  I find you people are getting rather slowing things. It should not be so.  Should be quick, fast because the country here is so - what should we say, is such a relaxing place and also the whole speed is so low.  But people are not, people are fast. They are very fast and quick in their dance, music, everything, you can see that. So one should not be like a drunken people.  We should not lope nor should we look like lotus eaters.  We have to be smart and fast moving and working it out. That's what it is. So tomorrow morning all of you should get up, do your meditation and come down to the river and have your bath there. So we have to be rather – be very fast.  I didn't sleep at all today. I mean I slept, if I slept at all, got up at 5.30 and got up at 5.30. So may God bless you all. So you shouldn't think that when you are tired and don't get into moods.  It's not a very good idea.  Yesterday you were in a very funny mood for Christmas. I was surprised. Like Good Friday. But the little girls brought forth the enthusiasm and the whole exuberance of their music.  So now today also, this gentleman is here.  He is a very good singer and he is going to sing some very good bhajans for us. I hope you all will enjoy.

S.Yogini. [unclear]

Shri Mataji:  That's her uncle and he's a very good singer. There's no need to be so serious. [unclear: He's a special Karacha man. There's no need to be moody here.]I just don't know what to do should be learning rituals every day. Don't know what to do you should be giving injections every day.]

And this is about the puja they are going to have in the Bramapuri saying that She is now going to stay in Bramapuri and how we are going to worship Her, what sari She is going to wear and all the description, beautiful.  I am just wearing an ordinary [cardi] sari, that's all, but this is what they desired that the Mother should be dressed up like that.  It's all fun.  It's what you call cultism [ ] of the Mother. They want Mother to be like this. Mother to have this.  We should be give Her this. It's such a beautiful description. For this was the music about Shri Krishna teasing Radhaji and Radhaji saying, “Look at this fellow, he's just torturing my life and things like that. It has a symbolic meaning that – you see Shri Krishna knew that she was the power and he all the time was telling her that you must do [rati] is ra is energy. So that he wanted her to impart her energy to everyone and made her dance so that everybody was nourished by it. And then her feet used to be paining and she said, “Now my feet are paining too much. You want me to do too much for this”. Then he would press her feet and say, “ All right now I'll press your feet but you'd better dance”.

That's a very beautiful conversation between Radha and Shri Krishna, how she was made to give her powers and her energy for the benevolence of the world, and how Shri Krishna tried to persuade her that she should do it. In my case it's just one [unclear]

Shri Mataji describes the meaning of the bhajan.

This is again the same, what we call the milkmaid song about Radhaji's song where she says that “I want to meet Shri Krishna”. That is the yoga. But symbolically she says the authority of the husband – she means the legal side of life. She says about her relations, like the Mother-in-law and the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law – so what she is trying to say that worldly things, worldly authorities of the government, worldly authorities of the so-called religions; the worldly authorities of so-called relationships, all of them don't allow me to go, and I don't know how to meet Shri Krishna. It's very symbolic. I don't know how many people understand. I think it's with very great innocence. But this is a symbolic expression that when you want to meet God there's so many drags and so many pressures on our lives. And this is sung very sweetly. And for a daughter-in-law in the family everybody is trying press her to keep her out of it and you have seen in your own societies, in your families, your surroundings, all these.  We have all these so-called authorities which are stopping you to meet God Almighty. It's a very beautiful folk-law in a very sweet, very described in a family manner.  A very symbolic deep way.  All of them are called [ ] It's the milkmaid's song.

She's the sister of [Mr ?] Her name is [ ] who has composed this beautiful poem which says I have come here to enjoy the joy. I don't know how to make it nearest. You say, means to lute. plunder of the joy. That's the beauty That's the beauty of the pun on the word. I have come here to plunder the joy. I don't know the poetry in Marathi gets a little upset in English. But doesn't matter. I hope you have understood the meaning, and it's a very good poem. I think this was published in Nirmala Yoga.

This is another style of describing Shri Krishna's mischief. He couldn't give realisation the way I could give you openly in the hall, sitting all of you getting your realisation. These were different days when there were not such possibilities and was not decided as very normal to have meetings and all the people are sitting down. So he used to – when the ladies would fill the water from the river at Yamuna and carry on their heads, the river at Yamuna was vibrated by Shri Radaji because she used to wash her feet in that water. He would sit on a tree, he was a little boy of eight years, sit on a tree and throw stones at their pitchers their what you call the pitcher – call them [kava]. You must know this one [kava] it will come again and again.  And it would break and the whole thing would fall on their back on their kundalini, and that's how the kundalini would rise. He'd throw the stick. So she was complaining you have broken my pitcher. Now this water pitcher also symbolises the material life, the ego. It was very interesting – I will nourish my family people. You have to nourish them by pampering their ego. Now it is finished it. This was very subtle and [sushma] that you can see the point is that they are saying, that see now you have broken my - she was complaining in a very sweet  manner because she liked it. So this is how it is.  It's very subtle and it was sung by villagers.  That's the point it.  It is such a simple heart, by a villager singing in such a simple way, and what a fast number. Very fast isn't it? You have tried your clapping. Try again.

The song is so much from your heart towards Me.  It's a very heartfelt song which says that, “Why are you angry with me Mother. Angry is a very harsh word but in Hindi language or in Marathi language is it a loosely means sweetly angry you can say. You have, if you don't talk to me who will I talk to? I have given you my life, my body, my everything and even if you do not talk to me at least listen to me once. That is if you can raise your glance at me. That one glance is sufficient to give me eternal life. So why don't you at least raise that glance at me? It's a very beautiful song coming out of a very beautiful heart, I should say, and it's so much suggesting of your feelings. You see the feelings are there, no doubt, but to put them into words and then into notes is very creditable I think. I give all my congratulations to the musicians and to the great Sahaja yogis, give him a hand.

So much from your heart towards Me. He's saying that you made saints because of what you have done good in your previous life.

Kabira does poetry you see. In Hindi language he is saying - he says that, Mother Earth says that I am greater than anyone. So the [unclear:  says, “What are you talking about, I am the snake on which you stand.  So what is the snake so great because snake has to go round the neck of Shiva. So what's so great about it? So Shiva says I am very great. So what is Shiva so great, because He has to run after His disciples as your Mother does? Now so he's not great either. So what are these disciples doing? They are half-baked over God and half-baked towards materialism, so he comes to the end.  He says that now isn't there about the nature he says beautiful things He says that – the cloth says to the tailor, Why are you cutting me? A day will come when you will need me to cover yourself. Means when you will be dead. Kabira is – you see this is a different type of a figure of speech which I should say is more, we call it [unclear] in two languages. It means the opposite in Marathi language. I don't know in English if you have so. Then he says that the carpenter is cutting the wood. He says, “Why are you cutting me? A day will come when I'll have to burn you. Then the third he says - and the best is this one, is that to the potter the clay is saying, “Why are you trying to put your feet on me and trying to trample on me? A day will come when I 'll be covering you completely. So this is typical of Kabira. In a very simple way he says what you call the contrast of life, that today we find that if something is so important and tomorrow we find that we become less important.  He says, “What is so great? Why should you get into these problems? Then he says that - now somebody says that he's my relation because he's my son-in-law and I must look after my son-in-law. But son-in-law is not yours now. You aren't anybody. What happens that it's just a relationship between you and him. Just like that. And then it goes on like this and he comes to the point where he says, what about your [bhakta] in the world? So beautifully it is brought in. He said relationship of Sahaja Yogis. So he actually brings it to Sahaja Yoga.  So beautifully he has brought in. This is what Kabira is. How he brings out the myth of so-called important things and shows you the essence of it. But in such a general way, in such a simple way – I should say very mundane, which we miss out. That's his, what you call can say, the deep penetration into understanding of our attitude towards [hate]. Very beautiful I should say.  So give him a hand for this.

Now the thing is that the system of our hymns, what you call the bhajans are sung like this the gentleman is singing.  Now because he's so much used to but it's to be sung absolutely in the soprano and nothing on the alto or tenor level but only the whole thing is on soprano. But normally we have three bases that we use and scales and out of that the centre scale these most musicians use but the bhajan people use the soprano on the last one and that's very very high and normal musicians use the middle one and then they go a little bit up and a little bit that side and little big this side. This is how melodies are made But this is a speciality of the musicians who are singing the bhajans.  So it is an old style that you are having but the modern ones are now using the same as  the you should say the normal musicians are using now like many artists are using. So this a habit from the soprano style, so they cannot sing at a lower level. And this is the thing is so that's how you find the difference. Like if you have a soprano singing then he or she won't be able to sing say a base or another alto or something like that. It is something that is scaled that way.  But that is what you have to know about Indian music. But it's remarkable that these people don't have that regular education regular training [ unclear] had for years together had.  He told Me that he is still learning.  Forty years he has learned now he is still learning. Despite that they are doing their daily work.  They are not professionals.  They are working and despite that how they have got you see innate knowledge, innate understanding and how they bring forth these beautiful notes and proper melodies and play on proper rhythm. It's very surprising how things have worked out.  I think it must be the rhythm of the country of Maharashtra is so great.  And there's a saying that there's a very beautiful poem about Maharashtra and what one of them is this Krishna was that this Marathi music is [Hindi] The language he speaks is of according to the rhythm of the flow of the Krishna rhythm. So this is the beauty of Maharashtra that whatever may be the riches and in every country  but to us the real ... is to our Maharashtra. I am also happy that all over the world now Maharashtra has become such a dear place. May God bless you.

I am just thanking them on your behalf and I would like to thank you on their behalf that you have been very generous and very kind to them and you have really appreciated their music in such a good mood. May God bless you all. So I should say good morning now.

May God bless you.
