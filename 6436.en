Public Program. Victoria Hall, Geneva (Switzerland), 8 July 1994.

At the very outset I have to tell you that truth is what it is. You cannot mold it, you cannot change it.  It is always the same. It has been the same, it is the same, it will be the same. But to say that we know the truth and that we have the truth is really a self-deception. If you had known the absolute truth there would have been no problems and everybody would have said the same thing. There would be no discussions, no arguments, no fights and wars. But when we don't know the absolute truth then we can find out our own mental conceptions as the truth. But this mind is so limited. How far can you go with it?  

Even science cannot answer many questions. It cannot say why are we on this Earth. It cannot explain why we evolved to human beings. So far this answer has [returned?] to religion, and to reason [NOT CLEAR] that truth is mental. It's such a frustration when you see in the name of religion, in the name of God, what people are doing is something we never expected. The religion has to be Spirit-oriented, but it is only power-oriented or money-oriented. In the original scriptures, or we can say in the origin of this religion was the truth. And all these religions bloom on the same play of spirituality like beautiful flowers at different times, but people have plucked it and now they are fighting with the dead flowers.

And then they say, "There is no God." They believe there is no God, some say, "We believe there is God," some say, "We believe in one God," some in many gods. They call each other heathens. But by this we don't solve the problem. They have been always told has to be internal mechanism which is within us. Sahaja Yoga, saha means with, ja born - with you is born the right to have this yoga. So what is the truth? Of course whatever I'm telling you, you need not believe it. We have had lots of problems with blind faith. But if it works out, then as honest people you have to accept it. The truth is that you are not this body, mind, these emotions, intellect, ego, superego, but you are the pure Spirit.

You see these beautiful flowers all over. We don't even think it's a miracle. We take them for granted. Who runs our heart? If you ask a doctor he'll say it is autonomous nervous system, but who is this auto? There is no answer for it. All these living works, who does? There is an all-pervading power of divine love that does all this divine work, which is living work. Our evolution also was performed by that power. Now what we have to understand: that this all-pervading power of divine love we have never met. 

In the Bible it is described as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. And to that, in all the scriptures: Koran it is described as Ruh, in the Indian scriptures it is described as Param Chaitanya.  Patanjali has called it by another name, which is very interesting, Ritambhara Pragya. So all these beautiful names mean one thing, is this all-pervading power of divine love. Now when you are connected to this divine love, to this power, then yoga takes place, union takes place. This is not a new theory I'm telling you. In ancient times specially in India people had become seekers of truth, and in many other countries also, and there were many seers, great saints who knew that this union is the only way, is the last breakthrough of our evolution. This power, Kundalini, is your own mother. She is your individual mother and She knows everything about you and She is very anxious to give you your second birth. With this happening, so many things you achieve that you are amazed at yourself.  

Firstly the Kundalini rises and She solves your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems. In Delhi University there are three doctors who have got their M.D. in Sahaja Yoga, and there is a fourth one who is doing something on cancer. It's a fact that Kundalini awakening has cured many incurable diseases like cancer. Because all human problems, physical, mental, emotional, comes from the centers that are within us, and these problems expand as they become collective. So we have then economic problems, political problems, social problems, because basically the human being is not in proper shape. So that if you are thinking of improving the world problems today is better that first you know yourself.  

I've known many people who have got peace awards, peace organization, no peace within their heart. Also I've seen people who say they are very religious, they are this, they are that, but when you see their life, you don't believe there is anything to do with religion. So first of all we have to be honest that we have to be our [selves?]. All the world problems, most of them, come from human beings and all these problems come to us from our centers, our chakras. Now if you can somehow try to correct these problems, then automatically everything is corrected.  

First of all your attention gets enlightened and this attention, when it is enlightened, becomes very powerful. It becomes very innocent and such an attention, even a glance of such a person can definitely improve the conditions around him. Now in this enlightened attention you know the absolute truth. How do you know? On your fingers. These five, six and seven centers on both hands are the endings of the sympathetic nervous system. And your hands start telling you, speaking, what's wrong with your centers. In the Koran it is written clearly that at the time of resurrection, Kiyama, your hands will speak and they give witness against you. Meaning they will tell what's wrong with you. Now that time has come, what we call as a Last Judgment. This time is a special time; I call it the blossom time. Because there are so many seekers of truth, genuine, honest, and it's so very [important?] to give them this yoga, this realization. 

I have actually done nothing, I would say, because this is the tradition of My country, except that I have been able to find out a method by which en-masse realization can be given. Now Sahaja Yoga is working in sixty-five nations, but [place in the shelf?] I should say, of course India I shouldn't say, because India knows all about it. Seventy per cent people are very intelligent and they are not bound, not bound by any dogma. They are like a clean slate. 

French, you see, is a language where there are many words missing, I think. I was told there is no word for awareness. There is no word for fun. Can you imagine there's no "fun". They are all [INAUDIBLE] miserables. So now one has to understand that something more has to happen to us. To know what we are. To be the Spirit and to have this self-knowledge, knowledge about our centers and knowledge about our [INAUDIBLE]. Once you are a realized soul, then you grow into it and you develop tremendous powers. First of all you become extremely dynamic, your creativity knows no bounds. [And not the English state slowly?], but a fact. But at the same time you are extremely compassionate, extremely compassionate, and you compassion acts. You can cure people; you can help people in many ways which are miraculous. All these powers are within you, they are your own powers. There's no obligation at all. When you put the seed in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself. In the same way when your Kundalini rises and passes through these various centers automatically, spontaneously, it nourishes all the centers, it integrates all the centers. Even I've seen children who were very bad at school have become brilliant, but at the same time they are humble.  

Now by knowing absolute truth you understand each other much more. That means a collective consciousness, a new dimension in your awareness. You can feel others on your finger tips and if you know how to correct your centers you can help them. Then who is the other? The microcosm becomes the macrocosm. It has to happen. It is for our benevolence. God, who has created us, has made every arrangement that we should enter into His kingdom. I can see the future of this world which looks full of turmoil, full of problems, is driving into a new era of truth, where there will be pure love.  

I've seen Sahaja yogis have from all over the world gathered together, we have never heard of somebody running away with somebody's wife or such nonsensical thing. There are never fights or arguments, but of course they'll pull each other's legs and have lot of fun. So life is very beautiful, but of course it's like a drunkard wants everybody to join him, we also want all of you to come to this beautiful era of enjoyment. Then you'll know your beauty, then you'll know your glory. You understand what you are. Of course you can't pay for it. It's your own, it's a living process. It's your own that works it out. Then you get over all these stupid barriers that we have created. You don't get into some [destitutions?] or some sort of a reciting of the mantras and all that, but you are the most normal person. You don't have to give up anything and go to jungles, there's no need to do that; you have to live in this world. There is no need to escape.

Your old habits that are destructive just drop out. You'll be amazed how many people who have taken to drugs have come to Sahaja Yoga have given up overnight, overnight. So many alcoholics have been cured. There's no end to the story. [INAUDIBLE] You jump into the ocean of joy. Joy is a singular experience. Is not like happiness and unhappiness. When your ego is [oppressed?] you feel unhappy and when it is pampered you feel happy. But joy in itself is an experience of tremendous joy that goes through your being and makes others also joyous. These hands start emitting cool vibrations because the vibrations ... but actually is called as phun, by Adi Shankaracharya, phun, means throbbing. With these vibrations we can improve our agricultural [INAUDIBLE]. I've seen such a big sunflower, so many of them of this size [treated by vibrations?]. So many things are there for you to see which are miraculous from the normal point of view. But we don't know our selves, we don't know our powers, we don't know our glory which we have to see. And sahaja means also easy, spontaneous. It has to work out in the  special times for you to achieve it.

I'm sure tonight you all will get your Self-realization, but it's a collective happening. Now you get your realization, then you'll feel on top of the world, you will get lost. Then again you come after one year say, "Mother, I've got this struggle that's how [or is it 'why']." But you have to come to the collective where you get all the knowledge that is necessary. Within one month you become your own master and you become real guru. Not a false one, but a real one. It is such a pleasure to see so many of you in this beautiful hall and I'm sure as this hall was created, all [INAUDIBLE] will be also one day show its results. It will take hardly about ten minutes for you to get your realization, but before that I have to tell you that there are three conditions which you have to fulfill. No money involved any time.  

But the first one is that you must have respect for yourself that you must have full confidence that you will get this Self-realization. That means one thing particularly: that you are not guilty. It is a fashion to feel guilty. If you have committed any mistakes, that's past. You should have faced it at that time. But if you feel guilty then this center on the left side catches very badly. Then you develop a very serious disease called angina, you'll also develop spondylitis, also your whole system becomes lethargic. Every day I'm giving lectures.  

Now the second condition is very simple: that you have to forgive everyone. Now many would say, "How can you forgive? It's very difficult." But whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. It is a myth. But because of this myth you play into wrong hands. Those who have harmed you are happy while you are unnecessarily [killing?] yourself. There's no love in it. Moreover at this time if the Kundalini is about to rise, this center goes out of gear, it won't rise, it won't be able to bear the fruit. And then if this center, which is for forgiveness... if you don't forgive, that is such s constrictive one, that it won't pass through either. So what is the use of not forgiving? Just you have to say, "I forgive everyone in general." You don't even think them [INAUDIBLE].

The third condition as I told you that you have to be extremely confident, absolutely confident about yourself, forgiving yourself, that you will get your Self-realization. In no way try to condemn yourself. As I respect you, you also respect yourself. At this moment specially we have to be in the present. You cannot, you cannot be in the present because we are jumping on the cusp of the future or the past, our mind is always there. One thought rises, falls down, another thought rises, falls down[INAUDIBLE] and you are [simply?]  either in the future or the past. In between these is a little space, which is the present. In the present you are completely aware, but there is no thought. So first thing that you will feel will be thoughtless awareness. When this happening takes place you'll be surprised, you become absolutely silent and peaceful within yourself and you will start seeing everything like a witness, and you witness a drama. You are witnessing it outside, and nothing will disturb you. 

So the first state what we call is thoughtless awareness. In Sanskrit is called Nirvichar Samadhi, and then we have another state, which some people achieve at the same time called as doubtless awareness. Thus you have a samadhi which is called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi. In fact, feeling the cool breeze in your hands for the first time you feel this All Pervading Power. Also you feel the cool breeze out of your own being, out of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood. Then just if you use it you will know what the value of it is.  

It is very, very simple. Please do not put concentration or pressure, or anything. Just leave it. Attention itself will be pulled in by the rise of Kundalini, and when She pierces this last, fontanel bone area, which we call as thaloo. Then you get your actualization, again I say actualization of baptism. So we have to actualize the experience firstly and secondly we have to become. I don't know how many lectures I've given you, English language, at least four thousand so far and in these short lectures I don't know how much I can tell you about it. When you see all these lights, no use telling you about electricity, how to make electricity and the whole thing - you just put on the light first. In the same way you should take your realization and look after it and grow into it. Life will be full of blessings.  

I told [INAUDIBLE] about their miracles, why don't you come [fight?] me? Within one month he said, "They have come up to my head, above my head. So you better choose now." I said, "I have no time." This [life?] is there for you [NOT CLEAR]. But one unfortunate thing is that I cannot force it on you. I'm sorry. I respect your freedom. If you don't want it, you better leave the hall. Nothing will happen to you, on the contrary you feel much better, brightened, relax, but if you don't want it, it's impossible.

[INAUDIBLE] I'm seventy-one years of age and [INAUDIBLE] every day what's going to happen to us Now we have to take out our shoes if you don't mind. In England in the beginning I tell, "You have to take out your shoes," half of them walked out. It was too much for them. All right. I don't know if she has told you that we have two sympathetic systems, left and right.

The left one is for your desire and right one is for your action. But Kundalini is pure desire, the power of pure desire. So you have to put on your lap, very comfortably sitting, your left hand like this. This shows that you are desiring of having your Self-realization. All right. Now with the right hand we will have to enrich our own chakras. We'll be working on the left-hand side. The Spirit resides in the heart, so put your right hand on your heart. If you are the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master, your own guru. Now you take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center which is created by great masters, prophets for us, as the center of our mastery. Then you please take your right hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center, you'll be surprised to know, is of pure divine knowledge. Now then we take back our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side. Then we take our right hand on your heart. 

Then in the corner of your neck and shoulder, and turn your head to your right. I've already told you that when you feel guilty then this center catches very badly. Now today I think quite a lot here. So please don't feel guilty. I don't know why should we feel guilty at all. Now place your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now please take back this right hand on the backside of your head and turn your head up. This is the center, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. This is only for your own satisfaction. Now stretch your palm fully, push back you fingers and put the center of your palm on top of your head. Push back your fingers. It's very important, it gives a good pressure. Put down your head and now move your scalp seven times slowly. That's all we have to do.   

Now as there are two powers we have to put our left and right foot away from each other. Put the left hand towards Me. You need not become very over-strict like that or slouch like that, just sit comfortably. Now you have to close your eyes but you can take out your spectacles as you don't have to open them till I tell you. Please put your right hand on your heart. Now close your eyes. Not heavily, but just close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very important fundamental question about yourself today. Please ask in your heart, you can call Me Mother, or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Ask a question in your heart three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

I told you that when you become the Spirit, you become your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of you abdomen on the left-hand side and press it. And here you ask another fundamental question about yourself three times to Me. Please ask, "Mother, am I my own master?" I've already confessed to you that I cannot force Self-realization or pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your right hand on the lower portion of you abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to say six times, because this center has got six petals. Please say in your heart, "Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge." As soon as you ask for divine knowledge Kundalini has started moving upward. So now we have to enrich our higher centers, to open them. So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is a center of your mastery. Here you have to say, again with full self-confidence, ten times, "Mother, I am my own master." At the very outset I told you that you are not this body, mind, ego, superego or conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."   

You'll have to know that this all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. It is an ocean of love and bliss, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness. So now please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here again with full self-confidence you have to say sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." Please say it. I've already explained to you; whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything, but if you don't forgive then you torture yourself and play into wrong hands. At this time if you do not forgive, then this constricted center won't allow Kundalini to pass through. Thus you will miss the greatest event of your life. So please forgive everyone. Place your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head and here you have to say again with full confidence, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." You must forgive at this moment. Just forgive at this moment. Just say that you forgive.  

Now please take your right hand now on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction. Ask for forgiveness from the Divine Power. Please say, "Oh Divine Power, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me." It's from your heart now. You need not count how many times. Even forgiveness that is your forgiving, you need not count. Just say it from your heart.  

Now the last center is very important. For that you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please push back your fingers so there is a better pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head. Here again I cannot force Self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So move your scalp clockwise seven times slowly saying in your heart, "Mother, please give me Self-realization."  

Now take back your hand and open your eyes slowly. Please put both the hands towards Me like this [INAUDIBLE]. Now put left hand towards Me like this and right hand like this and now bend your head and see for yourself on the left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now take your left hand like this  and with the right hand [INAUDIBLE]. See for yourself, you have to [INAUDIBLE] yourself. Some people might get it hot. It means you've not forgiven. Please forgive. Sometimes some people get it far away, sometimes very close. Now please put your right hand towards Me and put out the left hand on your fontanel bone area again, not on top, but away from it. [Bend your head, bend it, bend it?].  

Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this and ask a question, any one of these questions. Three questions, you ask one of them three times. First is, "Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Or second question is, "Mother, is it Ruh?" The third question is, "Mother is it Param Chaitanya, all-pervading power of divine love." Ask anyone of these questions three times. Now please bring down your hands. Put your hands towards Me and watch Me without thinking, thoughtless awareness. You'll feel very peaceful. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their finger tips or on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area, raise both your hands.  

I bow to you now. You are [saint enlightentment?] [NOT CLEAR]. Practically the fourth of Geneva. May God bless you all. Look after your Self-realization. I know some people didn't get it because they have some questions in their heads. All of you should come to the collective in a very humble way, Because we don't take any money, we have very humble centers. So please humble down in your hearts and come. I know all of you will grow and come after a year here again. I want to see you grown like big trees. I assure you, you don't have to pay for anything. You cannot pay for the Divine Love, it is invaluable. 

May God bless you all!
