Rome (Italy)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

... But not very long, you see. Just one like, "Your face is shining", sort of things, you see. Four, five lines, so that everybody can sing that. That’s all you have to do. And also, when these people, new people, will come and all that, in the beginning, I don't think you should bring them to ashram, to begin with. Begin with this one.
First, you should have all the programs there, then those people who are all right, then allow them to come to the ashram.
Guido: Yes
Shri Mataji: Like that, and then teach them also the music that we use. You should put them -because music is one thing which binds you much faster than anything else. And vibration wise also, it’s very good, because it takes away your thoughts. and it's very good for it. So, that's how you have to build up music like that.

Then you have, you see, a very good system here, which I think, you have a very good system, that among yourselves, you are very friendly, helpful, and you do not challenge Guido. Because that's another problem I always see everywhere, that they go on challenging the person who is connected to Me. So, then, what happens, that all my connection starts getting into problems. So, that is the best thing is to support him, help him in every way. I'm looking after him, and the things will work out very well.

Now when these people will be coming, you see, that's the main thing, how you should handle that. First of all, when they come, in the first one or two days, two times and all that, just you can put my tape for a while. Let them know about something then talk to them about it, and they'll ask their questions, then ask them to put their hands, ask them to meditate. See if the vibrations are coming or not. You should say that it will takes one or two times to do that. Now about the Kundalini, you should explain to them everything you should do that. But you should not teel them that that I'm Adi Shakti or anything, to begin with. Not at all nobody should talk about it. Not at all, nobody should talk about it.

Gradually, you should see, pick up people who are like that. Then you should say, "All right, ask a question" you see. "Is Mother the Adi Shakti?" "Is she the Holy Ghost?" and all those things. Then if it happens that way, then they will start gradually coming to Sahaja Yoga. You should not, at all, give them ideas, suddenly. The Mother is Adi Shakti, this is it. She's God. Because it's quite shocking for them, all right? So, take it easy. Bring them round.

But if they come to ashram, you see, you give them some tea, something. You can arrange some tea there also, can make some cake here, take it for them. When they are there, you give them some tea or something, you see. Because food is another thing which also binds you.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So, we should have. And then you can have some music also there, so that the
whole thing becomes interesting. So you can have a little of what you call, say my speech. Then you can have -
Guido: Yes, we show the video every Sunday.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Guido: We show the video, your tapes, on the video.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Guido: Every Sunday we give them tea.
Shri Mataji: Yes, little bit, not much. You need not show the whole thing. You give him them half the lecture. So, they're curious for the rest of that.
[Laughter]

Then after that what you do is to have once the- that is done, then you can have some meditation. Then you can have some music together. And then something to eat. You see, that's how it will settle down better, who are you, and be very kind. There might be some boots there. There might be some people who are possessed. Now don't tell on their faces, "You are boots, this thing, that thing". Simple thing is to tell them that, "You need to be corrected. For that, you have to put your left hand towards the photograph, put a light behind you, like this, and work it out. It will work out, you'll feel better. Next time, you come along and tell us.
So, start on photograph. We did the same. We had the same problem". Like that, taking upon on yourself, so they won't feel bad. Aways say that, "We were worse than you are. You are much better than us". So, nobody will feel hurt. Gradually, gradually, you have to bring them along. And once they are in, they will not go out as you do not go out.
[Laughter]

All right? So, but, it has to be done very wisely because what I find when I come, there are so many people. When I don't come, then they go out. What is the reason is? I'm not an Italian I don't understand Italian language, I cannot speak it. But there's something in Me that you like. That's why they are there. [Unclear] where you should have the same, is love, affection, kindness. Irritability should not be there. You should not be angry with them. You should not be unnecessarily upset with them.

And those people who are perfectly all right, who don't have problems, should talk, others should keep quiet. Otherwise, normally those who have problems should jump first and talk like a ‘bhoot’ to them. They run away.

So, the leader should decide who can do the talk. Everybody should not talk. Then sometimes, I'm seeing because people have been reporting to Me. They start arguing among themselves. Then they have a feeling that they don't know what they're talking.
But you keep one person. If there's any problem, you're going to ask him, "Now, what is this? What is that?" But do not argue among those. They should know that we are all one people. Respect each other. We live with respect. Each other's respect must be shown.

Like, I've seen people, it's all right, I'm calling him Guido, it's all right, because he's like my son. But you should not call him, all of you, Guido, even a little child will come say
'Guido'. It's not proper. I don't know how you say, but in our Indian language, they will say 'Guido ji' or Guido Uncle or Guiso- like that. We never take the names like that of our elders. So, one should not just say, or Guido brother, something like that.
All right?

It's better to talk, "Brother, hello brother, how are you?" Like we talk in the family. And not in a- where that is, sort of, as if on the street we are walking, hum? We belong to one family, We belong to one family, and we have to address each other as if we belong to one family. Like in India, anybody may be, we say, elder brother, younger brother. My grand-daughters were so much used to this, that their pot also, you see, they used to call it 'potty'. And then we said to 'ji' to everything dishes, so 'potty ji'. She used to say to potty also 'ji', 'potti ji'.
[Laughter]
Out of respect we say 'ji', like 'Guidoji', 'Gumarji', 'Modiji'. Everybody's is 'ji', 'Mataji'.
[Laughter]
But respect is one thing we must learn, of each other. Respect, help, sharing, we must learn. That is very important.

Then another thing is, I know that Italian is a very good language and I would like to learn it.
But you know how difficult it is going to be for me to learn so many languages.
[Laughter]
So, it’s better that you people try to learn English. It is better for us, because at least, and if possible, Marathi.
[Laughter]
Or Hindi, one of the languages, it's not difficult. Now I know at least five six languages. So, you can know one or two. All right?

The whole Sahasrara Day was wonderful. All this was very beautifully. And everybody was amazed how you arranged the place and how it happened, everything. And because they are not so positive as you are, there is some sort of negativity with them, that's why they cannot arrange like that. But there is a fact. If you are positive like, we could not arrange the hall in London for so many days. Ultimately, they said, "We cannot do it". So, I rang up, Ganapatipule it was. I rang up Arnaud. I said, "Arnaud, what about you?" He said, "Mother, all right". It what not Ganapatipule. What was the second one?
Sahaja Yogini: Purna.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: Purna.
Shri Mataji: Guru puja?
Sahaja Yogi: Navaratri
Guido: Navaratri. No, Diwali, Diwali.

Shri Mataji: Diwali?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Sahaja Yogini: Ganesha puja.
Guido: Navaratri, Navaratri. In Switzerland
Shri Mataji: In Switzerland, what was that?
Guido: Navaratri.
Shri Mataji: Navaratri! It was Navaratri, Navaratri puja. So, they said, "We cannot do anything. There's no possibility". Everybody wanted to come for Navratri. I rang up Arnaud. He said, "All right mother. I'll tell you tomorrow". Next day, he telephones to tell me that, "Mother, we've got a very good place", this and this. And you remember, we went up?
Guido: Yes.
Shri Mataji: And there we had the puja! Wonderful place, it was. That's how he arranged, in one day! He's such a positive man, Arnaud is a very positive man. So many Swiss don't like him because he's so positive. Big disparity, but doesn't matter. You must know that I know everyone. Like, some Swiss decided that he should not be there. They wrote letters to Me saying that, "Mother, we don't want him there. You'd better talk to us about it". Then one of them telephone to Me. So, I said, "What is it?" He said, "Oh, Arnaud is too strong on us", this, that. "So, what should we do?" I said, "See now, I just want Arnaud and all of you can go away from Sahaja Yoga".
So, she kept quiet. So this is what it is.
[Laughter]

We are doing very well now and I have great hopes about Italy, great hopes. I'm sure it will work out very well and that one day, we'll have a very great Center here. As it is, we have seen this place. Now we are thinking of buying it and all that. Let us see what happens. If you get that place, then we’ll get some people from all over, work it out, we have to build it up do it properly so that for many seminars, we can have such a big place you see. We can have some tents or something there. People can stay in the tent. We can have seminars or anything, I mean, whatever it is proper. You can do there, it's a very big place.

We had seen one place in London it had 12 and a half acres of land. But they said, "We'll not allow any motor cars to come in; we'll not allow any tents to be there". You see, then what's the use of getting this big place what are we going to do there? Nothing, we can't do anything!
So, that's how it feels love [unsure] What you people should see to it, that you arrange
everything properly and you can have a well there or something maybe. There must be water there, I'm sure. You might find some nice stones there. Anything is possible. So, just think of God and just do the job and you get everything that you need in that way.
And it was such a successful, time such a successful time, that everybody must learn from you how things have worked out.

Now the second part is that the children will be coming here, small children, and you must look after them. I was thinking that, from your school, there's one girl called Jane who is going through an education in Montessori. For now, she'll be finishing now and she can come here and teach the children. And you can also learn the ways and methods out of her. But some of the girls from here can learn Montessori.

[To a Sahaja Yogini] What are what are you doing? What are you studying?
Guido: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: I am working, Shri Mataji. I work.
Shri Mataji: As what?
Guido: She is working in a dentist studio.
Shri Mataji: What studio?
Guido: Dentist.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: What do you do there?
Guido: She is just helping, helping.
Sahaja Yogini: Assistant.
Guido: Assistant.
Shri Mataji: Assistant, ha.
[Laughter]
So-
Guido: But just half of the day.
Shri Mataji: Half of the day?
Guido: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Then you can join some, there must be a school.
Guido: She's very helpful in.
Shri Mataji: Is there a Montessori school here? She's very-
Guido: She is very helpful in this.
Sahaja Yogini: We have a Montessori school but it's very long the course, it's 3 years. We have to go to school every morning for 3 years to learn the Montessori.
Shri Mataji: Where is it?
Sahaja Yogini: It's in Rome in the-
Shri Mataji: But there must be some correspondence course.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, that's the only way outside.
Shri Mataji: Better do the correspondence course, you see, all of you together. You can all read about it and all of you discuss among yourselves. Better do it it's very good, because children can be helped all over.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You can discuss among yourself and start it. Now how? See, if they have an half day to start a school day, half day, so maybe, if you become quite Montessori expert, we can send you all the equipment of Montessori from India. You get it in a set.
Sahaja Yogini: From India?
Guido: From England.
Shri Mataji: India
Sahaja Yogini: India.
Shri Mataji: Of course. India's Montessori is very popular. All wooden things that they use, everything. You get a complete set there, not in England.
Sahaja Yogini: Not in England. We have in Italy. It's expensive
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Sahaja Yogini: But we yes, in Brescia, in the north there is a town where they make it.

Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: In the north of Italy.
Shri Mataji: In the?
Guido: In the north of Italy, but it's very, very expensive.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I can send you, if you want. Anything that you want, you can get it made, no problem. Just let me know what you want and we’ll order them.
Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: When the Sahaja Yogis are coming, they can bring. It’s something they can manage and they can bring baggage. It can be done, no problem.

I'm sure there must be lots of these things, there. I think that is the best thing you can do, in the schools.
