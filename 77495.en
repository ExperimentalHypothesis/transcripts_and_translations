... But not very long, you see. Just one like, "Your face is shining", sort of things, you see. Four, five lines, so that everybody can sing that. That’s all you have to do. And also, when these people, new people, will come and all that, in the beginning, I don't think you should bring them to ashram, to begin with. Begin with this one.
First, you should have all the programs there, then those people who are all right, then allow them to come to the ashram.
Guido: Yes
Shri Mataji: Like that, and then teach them also the music that we use. You should put them -because music is one thing which binds you much faster than anything else. And vibration wise also, it’s very good, because it takes away your thoughts. and it's very good for it. So, that's how you have to build up music like that.

Then you have, you see, a very good system here, which I think, you have a very good system, that among yourselves, you are very friendly, helpful, and you do not challenge Guido. Because that's another problem I always see everywhere, that they go on challenging the person who is connected to Me. So, then, what happens, that all my connection starts getting into problems. So, that is the best thing is to support him, help him in every way. I'm looking after him, and the things will work out very well.

Now when these people will be coming, you see, that's the main thing, how you should handle that. First of all, when they come, in the first one or two days, two times and all that, just you can put my tape for a while. Let them know about something then talk to them about it, and they'll ask their questions, then ask them to put their hands, ask them to meditate. See if the vibrations are coming or not. You should say that it will takes one or two times to do that. Now about the Kundalini, you should explain to them everything you should do that. But you should not teel them that that I'm Adi Shakti or anything, to begin with. Not at all nobody should talk about it. Not at all, nobody should talk about it.

Gradually, you should see, pick up people who are like that. Then you should say, "All right, ask a question" you see. "Is Mother the Adi Shakti?" "Is she the Holy Ghost?" and all those things. Then if it happens that way, then they will start gradually coming to Sahaja Yoga. You should not, at all, give them ideas, suddenly. The Mother is Adi Shakti, this is it. She's God. Because it's quite shocking for them, all right? So, take it easy. Bring them round.

But if they come to ashram, you see, you give them some tea, something. You can arrange some tea there also, can make some cake here, take it for them. When they are there, you give them some tea or something, you see. Because food is another thing which also binds you.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So, we should have. And then you can have some music also there, so that the
whole thing becomes interesting. So you can have a little of what you call, say my speech. Then you can have -
Guido: Yes, we show the video every Sunday.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Guido: We show the video, your tapes, on the video.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Guido: Every Sunday we give them tea.
Shri Mataji: Yes, little bit, not much. You need not show the whole thing. You give him them half the lecture. So, they're curious for the rest of that.
[Laughter]

Then after that what you do is to have once the- that is done, then you can have some meditation. Then you can have some music together. And then something to eat. You see, that's how it will settle down better, who are you, and be very kind. There might be some boots there. There might be some people who are possessed. Now don't tell on their faces, "You are boots, this thing, that thing". Simple thing is to tell them that, "You need to be corrected. For that, you have to put your left hand towards the photograph, put a light behind you, like this, and work it out. It will work out, you'll feel better. Next time, you come along and tell us.
So, start on photograph. We did the same. We had the same problem". Like that, taking upon on yourself, so they won't feel bad. Aways say that, "We were worse than you are. You are much better than us". So, nobody will feel hurt. Gradually, gradually, you have to bring them along. And once they are in, they will not go out as you do not go out.
[Laughter]

All right? So, but, it has to be done very wisely because what I find when I come, there are so many people. When I don't come, then they go out. What is the reason is? I'm not an Italian I don't understand Italian language, I cannot speak it. But there's something in Me that you like. That's why they are there. [Unclear] where you should have the same, is love, affection, kindness. Irritability should not be there. You should not be angry with them. You should not be unnecessarily upset with them.
