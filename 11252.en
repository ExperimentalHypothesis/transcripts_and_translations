Shri Mataji speaks before the drama “The Seekers’ play”

Now, the last one should be little more joyous note we should have, and it’s a small little drama, but I think I don’t know how much they have expanded it. Because I just gave them a sort of a, you can say the framework. But they said it has now become international, so I don’t know how many people are acting and how it is working out. But they said that we have to go, people had to go through the false gurus to know Mother. This was their thing they had given Me and it has worked out well, I think so. I don’t know what they have done about it [Shri Mataji laughs, laughter].
I just gave them the framework.
