115 Names of the Sat Guru

 Translated by Shri Mataji, on the 2nd December 1979, on the occasion of Guru Puja, where Shri Mataji declared that She is the Adi Shakti.

These beautiful names, which were translated by Shri Mataji Herself, have unfortunately been altered and modified over the years. Previously known as the 113 names, two names were missed out. Now, as best as could possibly be done, the Sanskrit names have been corrected to how they were originally said on the day and Shri Mataji’s translation transcribed, to as close as possible to Her original translation.
