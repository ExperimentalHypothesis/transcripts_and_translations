Immaculata

"There is a big inner revolution that is coming out.

We must understand we are delicately made beautiful flowers of God.

We are human beings.

And the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

This is the blossom time."

"I think next century we'll have beautiful people all around us, no trouble of wars, very peaceful we'll be all sitting in the kingdom of God."

The Vision

Since the beginning of time, human beings have been searching for answers.

Who am I?

Why am I here?

What is the purpose of existence?

Many great incarnations and prophets have tried to shed light on the human dilemma and urge us towards spiritual awakening.

Like different flowers on one tree of life, they spoke the same truth but were bathed in different fragrances.

Buddha saw enlightenment as the answer to our suffering: a thousand petal lotus emanating from the crown of the head.

Mohammad also spoke of the "Ruh" a cool breath flowing out of the top of the head and the hands. "At the time of resurrection, your hands [and your feet] will speak" he explained.

And Krishna in his playful mirth depicted the need for Yoga or union with the Divine. He spoke of the collective nature of man and the need for each of us to dissolve into the ocean of bliss.

Christ also explained that salvation will come only through a second birth. Forgiveness and compassion will clear the path towards this awakening, which will be felt as tongues of cool flames crowning the head in a divine halo. Heralding the New Age of enlightenment, he promised us a Comforter, the Holy Spirit, an incarnation who would lead us from darkness to the dawning of a new era.

The Age of the Mother has arrived.

Out of recognition for her great work, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has been held around the world as the Great Mother.

Since 1970, her mastery over the primordial energy, known as Kundalini, has drawn seekers to her public programs by the thousands. They come to experience the awakening of this energy, which is felt as a cool breeze emanating from the top of the head. As our spiritual mother, this force brings about or a profound state of inner peace, as we are spiritually reborn. Through this connection to the Divine, we go beyond the mind and into the state of thoughtless awareness which heals and soothes our inner psyche.

Lao Tse described the Kundalini in the most beautiful way: "There is a thing innate and natural, which existed before Heaven and Earth. Motionless and patternless, it stands alone and never changes. It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted. I do not know its name, if I am forced to give it a name, I call it Tao".

Shri Mataji was born to a Christian family of Chindawara, a town at the very centre of India. She arrived at midday on 21 of March 1923, on the Spring equinox at the time when planets were lined in the most extraordinary way. Heralding this auspicious event was her mother's dream to see a tiger. In the jungle, the wild animal appeared before her in all its splendour. She was overcome with joy and knew at that moment that there is something very special about her child.

Born with the knowledge that she had a divine gift, Shri Mataji felt the need to share her understanding of God with humanity from her childhood. Her parents knew why she was on the earth and her father, who was a very learned man, taught her to understand about human beings.

As a child, she was called Nirmala which means pure and she spent a very happy childhood endearing herself to all around her. She befriended all the animals and birds, sometimes even frightening the maids when she brought snakes into the house to caress. Another time she could be found alone in a remote corner of the house, her face beaming with inner joy, lost in meditation.
