I must say that Sahaja Yoga has reached such a climax now that I have to wait for other climaxes into another regions also. In music, in poetry, I cannot believe it. It has gone so far in such a short time. It has a speed, tremendous speed. I don't know now how many great writers, how many great painters, artists, musicians, will be reaching what heights? I'm sure they will be producing great economists and also very great politicians who will do this work and will manage all the things properly in the proper way in the Satyuga. May God bless you.
