Tape 2

(43 mins)

Shri Mataji: See, the Sahaja is such a sweet thing that in the beginning it makes you touch that. You see, you get the vibrations alright. And in the beginning it doesn’t give you the feeling of heaviness so much as it would to these people (yogis). It doesn’t make you feel nervous. Because supposing the first day, only, you get a heavy head, you would say, “What sort of a Sahaja Yoga is this one?” See? So it makes you, first of all, [feel] very nice and happy. But then, you see, it makes you also strong! And it makes you a witness. Then when you start you don’t mind: you just got this in your head, it’s alright “haaa hooo,” but you take it out, you fight it out. It’s like you see it’s raining now, in a battlefield, and you have to fight the satanic forces, alright? So suddenly you are not exposed to the battlefield, but what they do is to first of all prepare you. First you are hit by a mock sword, so you don’t feel it. Then you strengthen your sword.

Better now? Better?

They used to be frightened, you know! Anybody coming used to be frightened! They used to be very frightened, now they have become very relaxed!

Italian Yogi: (Tells story about something)

Shri Mataji: That’s what I was telling you that, God’s power is everywhere. You will see that now, you will feel it. When you become subtler and subtler you will see that, that is everywhere it’s acting, it’s organising with love. Only the trouble with us [is] we do not leave any space, any realm, for Him to act. When we try to do everything ourself he says, “Alright, go ahead!” You [must] allow Him to work out. Sahaja means that. ‘Sahaja’ means that you allow Him to work out.

English lady from Harrow: (tells story)

Shri Mataji: But to recognise me is a  big thing you have done. There are so many of brains, you see, but they don’t recognise. They never recognised Christ and it was very difficult and by the time they recognised Him, He had gone away and He was resurrected: that’s the time that they recognised. Then they started shouting and beating their heads. And this is what they did to you. That shows your pure sensitivity, pure sensitivity. If you are not sensitive you can never recognise me, whatever you may try: you cannot. That’s it!

Because there are so many realised-souls, some of them, born: they do not recognise.

English lady: Why?

Shri Mataji: You see, the reason is, because they have achieved their realisation, they think, through their efforts, through their penance, yes, and they think they have been very great warriors and they have done it, so the ego develops in them, and they do not want to recognise somebody in person because they have got it in an abstract way, so they do not want to recognise me. But sometimes they do not, but then ultimately they do. 

But those who are born at a much higher level, they recognise me already. I mean, I have not met them, so many of them, but they know me [that] I am there. They are telling people that that, “She is there. Go and meet [her].” So many of them.

Satpal is one of them, he went to somebody who is a mahatma who never comes out of his place; and first time before coming here he went to him and he said, “What are you asking me this [for]? The Shakti has gone to England now! She is there. Shakti is there. You have come from England, why don’t you see her there? She is there.”

But they stay in the temples, they stay in the forests, they are not down. Because they are afraid. You know, people might do something against them; they really tortured. And this also they catch [from them]. You are under my protection [so] I can look after you; but this catching business, if there is nobody to look after it, it can be terrible you see. Now this Gagangan Maharaj he has both the legs like this and hands are like this, he can’t walk by himself, so he goes on a tiger. He knows about me; because they have an awareness of a different style.

Are you better now? What is it? Give a bandhan to yourself. These all have come out from the same sort of problems as you have. They have all, very much, so they understand and they have patience for you, that’s the reason.

So whom did you go with?

Seeker: My guru?

Shri Mataji: Ha.

Seeker: Muktananda. You don’t like him?

Shri Mataji: Oh, like? I mean! So, did he touch you somewhere?

Seeker: Ah yes, he did touch me there.

Shri Mataji: Agnya?

Seeker: Yes, on the Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Yes, will you please remove your hair a little on top, if you can now watch here (Mother’s Agnya). 

Better now?

Horrible!

Actually Muktanand started, Muktanand was a realised-soul, his guru [Nityanand] was a realised soul. But I wouldn’t say that he was a very higher realised personality, but he was realised, born-realised, but he had not reached a great achievement to know many things. And he used to catch his Agnya too much from other people so he used to throw stones at people, anybody who would go to him he used to throw stones, and then this Muktanand also joined him and there are many others who joined him. And when he died Muktanand said, “I’m his chief disciple,” and this and that. But he developed this powers. And this you can develop very easily. It’s very easy. I’m going to tell you about how they developed these powers. But these are not powers but these are sort of diseases, actually. And as you can contaminate another by your disease, in the same way it was with this fellow.

And then he started this ashram in a very small manner to begin with. Then in India we have lots of black markets, lots of them; we had them and again we are having them. I mean, in any countries where there is too much of income tax there are these types of people.

In India you see, basically they are a little frightened of God all the time, so they think that, “We are doing all this [bad things] so let’s also have some generosity, some sort of a guru, so that we are saved.” You see at least a part of it should be given so they try to find out someone. So, you see, Muktanand came forward and actually he started an ashram for the people who were doing well. And then lots of hippies coming down to Goa and all these places. So they said, “Alright my guru has lived and I will start my ashram.” And he was in the military first of all and then he retired from there. On the other hand this fellow Jungde, he’s another horrible fellow, he joined him. And he was a private secretary of (some politician) ??? and that, because he was a private secretary before joining him, you see, he knew how to administer all forms of income. His wife was a very sensible woman to begin with but then she also got into it. And the business started falling. And the minister was the minister of industry in India, just Maharashtra, that part, that state. Actually I know him so well, you can’t imagine, this minister. He was my father’s fingers. And he knew about me from my childhood, he knew that I was something exceptional and all that. And he came to me one day and he asked me, and his wife also asked me, “What do you think of this Muktananda?” I said, “Which Muktanand?” Because many are called Muktanand. I said he was a realised-soul. But actually I did not pay any attention to Muktanand at that time. And they got into it so badly! You see, because the money that was coming from this black market and all that was given [by them to Muktanand] and these people had sort of a respite in that: so that they would give the money and the people would go and stay there and they would feel that a little bit our sins are being taken away by that sort of a charity. We call it as daan (दान: charitable gift). Daan is a gift to God or something you give to God. Then so many hippies we had in Goa and when they started...

Shri Mataji: Hello, how are you?

Seeker: Very well

Shri Mataji: Good, good! Very nice! Sit down on the chair. And you don’t wear [clothes] that tight, alright? Your clothes are too tight and we must all wear a little loose clothes, is a better idea.  Alright, put your hands out. I mean, no harm in wearing a tight one but for Kundalini movement and all that, if it is tight, then the muscle movement is not easy because it flows through your muscles and everything, the vibrations, so if it is a little loose clothes it is better. At least for meditation it is better. Alright.

...then this man, when he started this thing, these people from Goa, especially from Goa, had no money after some time. You see because the money that was sent to them was finished so maybe the parents must have given them up, whatever it is, so quite a lot of them were there in a big mess. So this gentleman, this minister, he thought, “Why not put these people into that ashram?” Sort of he brought all of them and put them there, sort of atonement for the sins. These he brought there. And he prepared in the early stages, some of them, into this business side of seeking. And they were taking drugs and everything. So on one side the drug system was there and on another side they were having their food and all that and it was like a show there. So, for Indians, when they went there they saw so many foreigners being saved, you know, [so] there feeling of pity was satisfied that, “What a thing we are doing for these poor people!” and “We are helping them out and everything.” And it was such a great experience for them to feel that, and everybody started donating money. And then this fellow started it in a big way and then he also started pressing at wrong points of many people. For example the one who had come that day, he had touched. And he touches on the private parts of - Muktananda has done - on many people he has done it. Not [only] that be he has also used some women, many more women, who came to me. But you see, Indian women are so afraid, even everybody is afraid, you see, the women, to say like that, that, “That he has used us.” Such a nonsense it is. I mean, it’s being a prostitute. It’s being like that.

But there were lots of reports and people went to the police and this and that and there was some Mr. Wuqtat, who was a minister of, I think he was the minister for the land and revenue, and the police came to him and everything happened and they wanted to have a case against it. They wanted to file a report against him, the way he was on. But you see, it went to the government said, “No, we are getting lots of foreign exchange now for that, so let him be, don’t disturb him.” Just imagine!

And I shouldn’t say all these things to you but I know this has happened, then you must know.

And so they left him alone to do whatever he pleases, because he was bringing lots of money! When he went to America, about three years back he got three crores of foreign exchange.

Seeker: They had a jumbo jet.

Shri Mataji: A jumbo jet, yes. And, with that, when he came back, naturally people said, “Now he’s bringing  money to us.” But actually he didn’t bring the money as such, he didn’t give it to the government. But you see, so much foreign exchange was earned and he got the exchange for that! You see, foreign exchange he got, is the point. You see, supposing you take money from here and it’s the foreign exchange, then the money you can have, Indian money you can have, but they get the foreign exchange, isn’t it. And that’s how they were very happy with him, because they could buy jumbo and all that, with that money.

So the whole thing turns out, just see how; how everybody gets involved into it. It passes through such a materialistic styles, and it makes everybody branded because, “It’s alright!” Like a prostitute selling her body and earning her money: “It’s alright! What’s wrong? I am getting money quite alright, what’s wrong in it?” It’s the same style. And that’s how the government, at the time of Indira Gandhi only this happened, that she said, “What’s wrong in it? He’s doing foreign exchange, let him do it. We are having foreign exchange, what’s the harm?” 

Same thing happened with the fellow Brahmachary who was with us. Every day he used to come on the television! Horrible fellow! And when he came here he wanted to give me a photo. I’ll manage him that way. But I am saying [that] this is what it is. And every day he was there [on TV] and that ashram was donated to him free of cost by the government people! Government has given that ashram! Such a big ashram. And he was given special facilities; like he could travel anywhere he wanted to and he could enter into Indira Gandhi’s house, absolutely, even in the night. Any time he could come out and enter there and stay with her and do whatever he pleases! When the whole government collapsed then this came out, but this fellow, this Brahmachary was having a...there was a lady, Chopra, Mrs. Chopra, but the man [husband] reported that he used that woman: and there were seven rooms he had which and he used to be in the seventh room and you have to pass from one to another and the one who went to it seventh had this kind of a ‘blessing’ from him. 

And this Mrs. Chopra, poor thing, you know, it was announced in the paper, all these things came up: her husband told that, “This is what happened, I went from the back side on the seventh floor and and I saw her sleeping with him!” He saw and he said, nobody hit him or anything [but] he was arrested and he was sent to jail and he was in jail all the time, because he saw this happening to his own wife! And when this Indira Gandhi’s went down then his wife said, “Yes, it’s a fact.” But in India such wives have no place so poor thing, she’s in a very big mess now, but this is what it is.

Lady from Harrow: I can’t understand why the women let him do it.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. But what happens, I tell you, the way they impress on you [is] because they mesmerise you, they mesmerise you. They mesmerise you. And by that and they just say, “Come along, this is God’s thing. You are a seeker.” 

Lady from Harrow: They manipulate you.

Shri Mataji:Oh, they play all kinds of tricks! They mesmerise you. They are very polite, they are very kind. They never say anything against anyone. Oh, and you think they are a gem of a people. They are very, very soft spoken and very sweet to you and [then] all sorts of things they do.

Seeker: Are you saying that Muktananda was doing this? Or was it this Brahmachary?

Shri Mataji: Yes, very much. Very much!

Seeker: But Muktananda is a powerful abstainer isn’t he.

Shri Mataji: He tells outside, abstainer. That’s what it is after. They tell as if it is abstaining. And then [when] you go inside and they tell the women! 

Yogi: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: They have a private audience. They are rakshasas! They can have ten women at a time. They are horrid people! They eat like hell! If you see how much they eat. This Muktananda’s food, if you see, you’ll be surprised how much he can eat.

Seeker: They say he eats very little, and that, since he was fifteen he has been a total abstainer.

Shri Mataji: That is what it is! You see, what happens is that they have a group of people around them and they give all these stories. All these stories are given out like that. Terrible!

I went to see him, Muktanand, just to put him a little bit right. Oh, but he is a master so you cannot put a master right! I wanted to see him what sort of a fellow he was, and he looked at me coming in a big car with a chauffeur, then they know that she’s such and such and her husband is such and such. And he looked at me and he came with a very great thing and he gave me also a shawl. I said, “I don’t take anything from you.” And he took me down to the meditation hall and all that and he said, “You see we need lots of money to build up this and that and that...” I said, “In this meditation hall you have got photographs of so many people! What are these people who are here?” He said, “These are all the people who come at my feet!” I said, “Really?” And he took my photograph also with him, somebody was there who took my photograph, so I said, “Are you going to put that one also here?” He said, “They come at my feet.” He said, “No this is meditation hall, and I want to tell people because once they recognise that way then they’ll surrender better.” He said, “Are you by the way interested in meditation?” I said, “By the way I am not at all interested.”

And many women have come to him, but they don’t want to say it.

Seeker: Brahmachary is in jail now isn’t he.

Shri Mataji: Brahmachary was in jail, but what about this Dekhadas? Dekhadas is the same type. He’s now got leprosy, imagine he’s got leprosy! And another thing is Muktananda is suffering from VD! Now this is the limit of this: he’s suffering from VD!

You see, he has a doctor who is a brother-in-law of Subramaniam.

Lady from Harrow: Why do they do this?

Shri Mataji: Because they are on the other extreme, you see. Because they are monsters!

Lady from Harrow: Everything they do is exaggerated not just sex but food...

Shri Mataji: Everything! Or they will be abstaining to such an extent, some of them are like this also, I would say, they can be like that; that they are hot tempered, absolutely! They don’t eat anything, they eat only human beings, you see the mind is like that, their appetite is that if anybody passes, “Put them! Do this! Do that!” Absolutely from inside sort of a burning fire! They can be two types, extremes.

Yogi: Like the old sages.

Shri Mataji: Yes we have had some Vishwamitras and all that in our own times, we have had. They never did any salvation work for the people. You have to be in the centre. Sex? Alright, but must have sanctified sex. And rise above it. You should feel satisfied about it because if you do not feel satisfied about it that means it’s no good! So with one wife, one person, if you have sex all your life, then gradually you rise and you go deeper into her, deeper understanding into it. But you see the whole society is so upside down: they think if you have sex then you are a great person! I mean what is so great? This is only done among...you know, impotent people only think like this! You see, only impotent people have these kind of ideas that if you have sex, then only you are a great person. 

Gradually in India, if you start from childhood that [you] try to keep your mind away from this as far as possible. I mean, you are not even allowed to see naked women or any photograph like that. I mean, they used to say that put your eyes always down below. I mean, anyone like that walks with the eyes down below, in India. The people of my age in India walk with the eyes down below, I mean, those who are brought up from the proper family. And, looking too much at women or interested in women, people don’t like; they don’t like it. In the society women are separate, men are separate, if you meet [or] anything.  And any man coming too much among the women and talking too much then they won’t like it; they call him (grandpa??), which is a bad name for him. Here, the other day for the priest, they said, “He’s a ladykiller!” I mean, if you said this to an Indian he will die of shame, “Oh God!” Because we have had models like Rama. It’s regarded as very bad! You ask them, they have been to the villages: very innocent people! They just don’t bother about these things. I mean, if somebody does that they think, “Ah! What sort of a man!”

Now, in my family, once two sanyasis came and my daughter said, “Mummy, you don’t let these two horrible fellows! You see they have very bad eyes. We don’t want to have them in the house.” And here a girl seems very much enamoured [by attention]. We are surprised at that. Once my husband came down and he said, “You know, it’s very funny about these people! The father of the girl was telling me that these two girls went for a bathing in some place, and all boys were making remarks about them, and they were feeling very great about it!” In India the girl would have taken out her slipper and beaten those boys! How dare he pass remark at her! And this is getting on [encroaching] your privacy. Everybody doesn’t have the right to look at us with that eyes! That should be taught.

And it’s surprising [that] it’s in this place where Christ is worshipped. What did He say for this? Not even the adulterous eyes. To that subtle power he went into. Even not only the mind but even the adulterous eyes. Even if you have adulterous eyes, he will not live here: he said it clearly. It’s an insult! It’s just to make Him die in this place [Agnya] that they did all this.

It’s not regarded as good manners in India to be exposed like this: very bad manners.

Now they asked me first about the United Kingdom -  how women live and how they behave. I said, “You meet all wrong type of people.” But you were also [once dharmic] like that. It’s all been spoilt only recently. Funny ideas of modernism of exposing women. I mean, one should feel ashamed! And that’s how the women, when they lose their power, the whole nation just collapses. It’s only on the women, their power, that the nation exists: on their sense and their wisdom. And they become so aggressive! 

Now this boy has a mother who is so aggressive! Terrible people! Is she better now?

I know, I know how they are. I have seen them.
