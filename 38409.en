Tape 2

(43 mins)

Shri Mataji: See, the Sahaja is such a sweet thing that in the beginning it makes you touch that. You see, you get the vibrations alright. And in the beginning it doesn’t give you the feeling of heaviness so much as it would to these people (yogis). It doesn’t make you feel nervous. Because supposing the first day, only, you get a heavy head, you would say, “What sort of a Sahaja Yoga is this one?” See? So it makes you, first of all, [feel] very nice and happy. But then, you see, it makes you also strong! And it makes you a witness. Then when you start you don’t mind: you just got this in your head, it’s alright “haaa hooo,” but you take it out, you fight it out. It’s like you see it’s raining now, in a battlefield, and you have to fight the satanic forces, alright? So suddenly you are not exposed to the battlefield, but what they do is to first of all prepare you. First you are hit by a mock sword, so you don’t feel it. Then you strengthen your sword.

Better now? Better?

They used to be frightened, you know! Anybody coming used to be frightened! They used to be very frightened, now they have become very relaxed!

Italian Yogi: (Tells story about something)

Shri Mataji: That’s what I was telling you that, God’s power is everywhere. You will see that now, you will feel it. When you become subtler and subtler you will see that, that is everywhere it’s acting, it’s organising with love. Only the trouble with us [is] we do not leave any space, any realm, for Him to act. When we try to do everything ourself he says, “Alright, go ahead!” You [must] allow Him to work out. Sahaja means that. ‘Sahaja’ means that you allow Him to work out.

English lady from Harrow: (tells story)

Shri Mataji: But to recognise me is a  big thing you have done. There are so many of brains, you see, but they don’t recognise. They never recognised Christ and it was very difficult and by the time they recognised Him, He had gone away and He was resurrected: that’s the time that they recognised. Then they started shouting and beating their heads. And this is what they did to you. That shows your pure sensitivity, pure sensitivity. If you are not sensitive you can never recognise me, whatever you may try: you cannot. That’s it!

Because there are so many realised-souls, some of them, born: they do not recognise.

English lady: Why?

Shri Mataji: You see, the reason is, because they have achieved their realisation, they think, through their efforts, through their penance, yes, and they think they have been very great warriors and they have done it, so the ego develops in them, and they do not want to recognise somebody in person because they have got it in an abstract way, so they do not want to recognise me. But sometimes they do not, but then ultimately they do. 

But those who are born at a much higher level, they recognise me already. I mean, I have not met them, so many of them, but they know me [that] I am there. They are telling people that that, “She is there. Go and meet [her].” So many of them.

Satpal is one of them, he went to somebody who is a mahatma who never comes out of his place; and first time before coming here he went to him and he said, “What are you asking me this [for]? The Shakti has gone to England now! She is there. Shakti is there. You have come from England, why don’t you see her there? She is there.”

But they stay in the temples, they stay in the forests, they are not down. Because they are afraid. You know, people might do something against them. They really tortured. And this also they catch [from them]. You are under my protection [so] I can look after you; but this catching business, if there is nobody to look after it, it can be terrible you see. Now this Gagangan Maharaj he has both the legs like this and hands are like this, he can’t walk (51.13)
