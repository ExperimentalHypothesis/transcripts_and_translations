Tape 1

(43 mins)

Shri Mataji: See, the Sahaja is such a sweet thing that in the beginning it makes you touch that. You see, you get the vibrations alright. And in the beginning it doesn’t give you the feeling of heaviness so much as it would to these people (yogis). It doesn’t make you feel nervous. Because supposing the first day, only, you get a heavy head, you would say, “What sort of a Sahaja Yoga is this one?” See? So it makes you, first of all, [feel] very nice and happy. But then, you see, it makes you also strong! And it makes you a witness. Then when you start you don’t mind: you just got this in your head, it’s alright “haaa hooo,” but you take it out, you fight it out. It’s like you see it’s raining now, in a battlefield, and you have to fight the satanic forces, alright? So suddenly you are not exposed to the battlefield, but what they do is to first of all prepare you. First you are hit by a mock sword, so you don’t feel it. Then you strengthen your sword.

Better now? Better?

They used to be frightened, you know! Anybody coming used to be frightened! They used to be very frightened, now they have become very relaxed!

Italian Yogi: (Tells story about something)

Shri Mataji: That’s what I was telling you that, God’s power is everywhere. You will see that now, you will feel it. When you become subtler and subtler you will see that, that is everywhere it’s acting, it’s organising with love. Only the trouble with us [is] we do not leave any space, any realm, for Him to act. When we try to do everything ourself he says, “Alright, go ahead!” You [must] allow Him to work out. Sahaja means that. ‘Sahaja’ means that you allow Him to work out.

English lady from Harrow: (tells story)

Shri Mataji: But to recognise me is a  big thing you have done. There are so many of brains, you see, but they don’t recognise. They never recognised Christ and it was very difficult and by the time they recognised Him, He had gone away and He was resurrected: that’s the time that they recognised. Then they started shouting and beating their heads. And this is what they did to you. That shows your pure sensitivity, pure sensitivity. If you are not sensitive you can never recognise me, whatever you may try: you cannot. That’s it!

Because there are so many realised-souls, some of them, born: they do not recognise.

English lady: Why?

Shri Mataji: You see, the reason is, because they have achieved their realisation, they think, through their efforts, through their penance, yes, and they think they have been very great warriors and they have done it, so the ego develops in them, and they do not want to recognise somebody in person because they have got it in an abstract way, so they do not want to recognise me. But sometimes they do not, but then ultimately they do. 

But those who are born at a much higher level, they recognise me already. I mean, I have not met them, so many of them, but they know me [that] I am there. They are telling people that that, “She is there. Go and meet [her].” So many of them.

Satpal is one of them, he went to somebody who is a mahatma who never comes out of his place; and first time before coming here he went to him and he said, “What are you asking me this [for]? The Shakti has gone to England now! She is there. Shakti is there. You have come from England, why don’t you see her there? She is there.”

But they stay in the temples, they stay in the forests, they are not down. Because they are afraid. You know, people might do something against them; they really tortured. And this also they catch [from them]. You are under my protection [so] I can look after you; but this catching business, if there is nobody to look after it, it can be terrible you see. Now this Gagangan Maharaj he has both the legs like this and hands are like this, he can’t walk by himself, so he goes on a tiger. He knows about me; because they have an awareness of a different style.

Are you better now? What is it? Give a bandhan to yourself. These all have come out from the same sort of problems as you have. They have all, very much, so they understand and they have patience for you, that’s the reason.

So whom did you go with?

Seeker: My guru?

Shri Mataji: Ha.

Seeker: Muktananda. You don’t like him?

Shri Mataji: Oh, like? I mean! So, did he touch you somewhere?

Seeker: Ah yes, he did touch me there.

Shri Mataji: Agnya?

Seeker: Yes, on the Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Yes, will you please remove your hair a little on top, if you can now watch here (Mother’s Agnya). 

Better now?

Horrible!

Actually Muktanand started, Muktanand was a realised-soul, his guru [Nityanand] was a realised soul. But I wouldn’t say that he was a very higher realised personality, but he was realised, born-realised, but he had not reached a great achievement to know many things. And he used to catch his Agnya too much from other people so he used to throw stones at people, anybody who would go to him he used to throw stones, and then this Muktanand also joined him and there are many others who joined him. And when he died Muktanand said, “I’m his chief disciple,” and this and that. But he developed this powers. And this you can develop very easily. It’s very easy. I’m going to tell you about how they developed these powers. But these are not powers but these are sort of diseases, actually. And as you can contaminate another by your disease, in the same way it was with this fellow.

And then he started this ashram in a very small manner to begin with. Then in India we have lots of black markets, lots of them; we had them and again we are having them. I mean, in any countries where there is too much of income tax there are these types of people.

In India you see, basically they are a little frightened of God all the time, so they think that, “We are doing all this [bad things] so let’s also have some generosity, some sort of a guru, so that we are saved.” You see at least a part of it should be given so they try to find out someone. So, you see, Muktanand came forward and actually he started an ashram for the people who were doing well. And then lots of hippies coming down to Goa and all these places. So they said, “Alright my guru has lived and I will start my ashram.” And he was in the military first of all and then he retired from there. On the other hand this fellow Jungde, he’s another horrible fellow, he joined him. And he was a private secretary of (some politician) ??? and that, because he was a private secretary before joining him, you see, he knew how to administer all forms of income. His wife was a very sensible woman to begin with but then she also got into it. And the business started falling. And the minister was the minister of industry in India, just Maharashtra, that part, that state. Actually I know him so well, you can’t imagine, this minister. He was my father’s fingers. And he knew about me from my childhood, he knew that I was something exceptional and all that. And he came to me one day and he asked me, and his wife also asked me, “What do you think of this Muktananda?” I said, “Which Muktanand?” Because many are called Muktanand. I said he was a realised-soul. But actually I did not pay any attention to Muktanand at that time. And they got into it so badly! You see, because the money that was coming from this black market and all that was given [by them to Muktanand] and these people had sort of a respite in that: so that they would give the money and the people would go and stay there and they would feel that a little bit our sins are being taken away by that sort of a charity. We call it as daan (दान: charitable gift). Daan is a gift to God or something you give to God. Then so many hippies we had in Goa and when they started...

Shri Mataji: Hello, how are you?

Seeker: Very well

Shri Mataji: Good, good! Very nice! Sit down on the chair. And you don’t wear [clothes] that tight, alright? Your clothes are too tight and we must all wear a little loose clothes, is a better idea.  Alright, put your hands out. I mean, no harm in wearing a tight one but for Kundalini movement and all that, if it is tight, then the muscle movement is not easy because it flows through your muscles and everything, the vibrations, so if it is a little loose clothes it is better. At least for meditation it is better. Alright.

...then this man, when he started this thing, these people from Goa, especially from Goa, had no money after some time. You see because the money that was sent to them was finished so maybe the parents must have given them up, whatever it is, so quite a lot of them were there in a big mess. So this gentleman, this minister, he thought, “Why not put these people into that ashram?” Sort of he brought all of them and put them there, sort of atonement for the sins. These he brought there. And he prepared in the early stages, some of them, into this business side of seeking. And they were taking drugs and everything. So on one side the drug system was there and on another side they were having their food and all that and it was like a show there. So, for Indians, when they went there they saw so many foreigners being saved, you know, [so] there feeling of pity was satisfied that, “What a thing we are doing for these poor people!” and “We are helping them out and everything.” And it was such a great experience for them to feel that, and everybody started donating money. And then this fellow started it in a big way and then he also started pressing at wrong points of many people. For example the one who had come that day, he had touched. And he touches on the private parts of - Muktananda has done - on many people he has done it. Not [only] that be he has also used some women, many more women, who came to me. But you see, Indian women are so afraid, even everybody is afraid, you see, the women, to say like that, that, “That he has used us.” Such a nonsense it is. I mean, it’s being a prostitute. It’s being like that.

But there were lots of reports and people went to the police and this and that and there was some Mr. Wuqtat, who was a minister of, I think he was the minister for the land and revenue, and the police came to him and everything happened and they wanted to have a case against it. They wanted to file a report against him, the way he was on. But you see, it went to the government said, “No, we are getting lots of foreign exchange now for that, so let him be, don’t disturb him.” Just imagine!

And I shouldn’t say all these things to you but I know this has happened, then you must know.

And so they left him alone to do whatever he pleases, because he was bringing lots of money! When he went to America, about three years back he got three crores of foreign exchange.

Seeker: They had a jumbo jet.

Shri Mataji: A jumbo jet, yes. And, with that, when he came back, naturally people said, “Now he’s bringing  money to us.” But actually he didn’t bring the money as such, he didn’t give it to the government. But you see, so much foreign exchange was earned and he got the exchange for that! You see, foreign exchange he got, is the point. You see, supposing you take money from here and it’s the foreign exchange, then the money you can have, Indian money you can have, but they get the foreign exchange, isn’t it. And that’s how they were very happy with him, because they could buy jumbo and all that, with that money.

So the whole thing turns out, just see how; how everybody gets involved into it. It passes through such a materialistic styles, and it makes everybody branded because, “It’s alright!” Like a prostitute selling her body and earning her money: “It’s alright! What’s wrong? I am getting money quite alright, what’s wrong in it?” It’s the same style. And that’s how the government, at the time of Indira Gandhi only this happened, that she said, “What’s wrong in it? He’s doing foreign exchange, let him do it. We are having foreign exchange, what’s the harm?” 

Same thing happened with the fellow Brahmachary who was with us. Every day he used to come on the television! Horrible fellow! And when he came here he wanted to give me a photo. I’ll manage him that way. But I am saying [that] this is what it is. And every day he was there [on TV] and that ashram was donated to him free of cost by the government people! Government has given that ashram! Such a big ashram. And he was given special facilities; like he could travel anywhere he wanted to and he could enter into Indira Gandhi’s house, absolutely, even in the night. Any time he could come out and enter there and stay with her and do whatever he pleases! When the whole government collapsed then this came out, but this fellow, this Brahmachary was having a...there was a lady, Chopra, Mrs. Chopra, but the man [husband] reported that he used that woman: and there were seven rooms he had which and he used to be in the seventh room and you have to pass from one to another and the one who went to it seventh had this kind of a ‘blessing’ from him. 

And this Mrs. Chopra, poor thing, you know, it was announced in the paper, all these things came up: her husband told that, “This is what happened, I went from the back side on the seventh floor and and I saw her sleeping with him!” He saw and he said, nobody hit him or anything [but] he was arrested and he was sent to jail and he was in jail all the time, because he saw this happening to his own wife! And when this Indira Gandhi’s went down then his wife said, “Yes, it’s a fact.” But in India such wives have no place so poor thing, she’s in a very big mess now, but this is what it is.

Lady from Harrow: I can’t understand why the women let him do it.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. But what happens, I tell you, the way they impress on you [is] because they mesmerise you, they mesmerise you. They mesmerise you. And by that and they just say, “Come along, this is God’s thing. You are a seeker.” 

Lady from Harrow: They manipulate you.

Shri Mataji:Oh, they play all kinds of tricks! They mesmerise you. They are very polite, they are very kind. They never say anything against anyone. Oh, and you think they are a gem of a people. They are very, very soft spoken and very sweet to you and [then] all sorts of things they do.

Seeker: Are you saying that Muktananda was doing this? Or was it this Brahmachary?

Shri Mataji: Yes, very much. Very much!

Seeker: But Muktananda is a powerful abstainer isn’t he.

Shri Mataji: He tells outside, abstainer. That’s what it is after. They tell as if it is abstaining. And then [when] you go inside and they tell the women! 

Yogi: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: They have a private audience. They are rakshasas! They can have ten women at a time. They are horrid people! They eat like hell! If you see how much they eat. This Muktananda’s food, if you see, you’ll be surprised how much he can eat.

Seeker: They say he eats very little, and that, since he was fifteen he has been a total abstainer.

Shri Mataji: That is what it is! You see, what happens is that they have a group of people around them and they give all these stories. All these stories are given out like that. Terrible!

I went to see him, Muktanand, just to put him a little bit right. Oh, but he is a master so you cannot put a master right! I wanted to see him what sort of a fellow he was, and he looked at me coming in a big car with a chauffeur, then they know that she’s such and such and her husband is such and such. And he looked at me and he came with a very great thing and he gave me also a shawl. I said, “I don’t take anything from you.” And he took me down to the meditation hall and all that and he said, “You see we need lots of money to build up this and that and that...” I said, “In this meditation hall you have got photographs of so many people! What are these people who are here?” He said, “These are all the people who come at my feet!” I said, “Really?” And he took my photograph also with him, somebody was there who took my photograph, so I said, “Are you going to put that one also here?” He said, “They come at my feet.” He said, “No this is meditation hall, and I want to tell people because once they recognise that way then they’ll surrender better.” He said, “Are you by the way interested in meditation?” I said, “By the way I am not at all interested.”

And many women have come to him, but they don’t want to say it.

Seeker: Brahmachary is in jail now isn’t he.

Shri Mataji: Brahmachary was in jail, but what about this Dekhadas? Dekhadas is the same type. He’s now got leprosy, imagine he’s got leprosy! And another thing is Muktananda is suffering from VD! Now this is the limit of this: he’s suffering from VD!

You see, he has a doctor who is a brother-in-law of Subramaniam.

Lady from Harrow: Why do they do this?

Shri Mataji: Because they are on the other extreme, you see. Because they are monsters!

Lady from Harrow: Everything they do is exaggerated not just sex but food...

Shri Mataji: Everything! Or they will be abstaining to such an extent, some of them are like this also, I would say, they can be like that; that they are hot tempered, absolutely! They don’t eat anything, they eat only human beings, you see the mind is like that, their appetite is that if anybody passes, “Put them! Do this! Do that!” Absolutely from inside sort of a burning fire! They can be two types, extremes.

Yogi: Like the old sages.

Shri Mataji: Yes we have had some Vishwamitras and all that in our own times, we have had. They never did any salvation work for the people. You have to be in the centre. Sex? Alright, but must have sanctified sex. And rise above it. You should feel satisfied about it because if you do not feel satisfied about it that means it’s no good! So with one wife, one person, if you have sex all your life, then gradually you rise and you go deeper into her, deeper understanding into it. But you see the whole society is so upside down: they think if you have sex then you are a great person! I mean what is so great? This is only done among...you know, impotent people only think like this! You see, only impotent people have these kind of ideas that if you have sex, then only you are a great person. 

Gradually in India, if you start from childhood that [you] try to keep your mind away from this as far as possible. I mean, you are not even allowed to see naked women or any photograph like that. I mean, they used to say that put your eyes always down below. I mean, anyone like that walks with the eyes down below, in India. The people of my age in India walk with the eyes down below, I mean, those who are brought up from the proper family. And, looking too much at women or interested in women, people don’t like; they don’t like it. In the society women are separate, men are separate, if you meet [or] anything.  And any man coming too much among the women and talking too much then they won’t like it; they call him (grandpa??), which is a bad name for him. Here, the other day for the priest, they said, “He’s a ladykiller!” I mean, if you said this to an Indian he will die of shame, “Oh God!” Because we have had models like Rama. It’s regarded as very bad! You ask them, they have been to the villages: very innocent people! They just don’t bother about these things. I mean, if somebody does that they think, “Ah! What sort of a man!”

Now, in my family, once two sanyasis came and my daughter said, “Mummy, you don’t let these two horrible fellows! You see they have very bad eyes. We don’t want to have them in the house.” And here a girl seems very much enamoured [by attention]. We are surprised at that. Once my husband came down and he said, “You know, it’s very funny about these people! The father of the girl was telling me that these two girls went for a bathing in some place, and all boys were making remarks about them, and they were feeling very great about it!” In India the girl would have taken out her slipper and beaten those boys! How dare he pass remark at her! And this is getting on [encroaching] your privacy. Everybody doesn’t have the right to look at us with that eyes! That should be taught.

And it’s surprising [that] it’s in this place where Christ is worshipped. What did He say for this? Not even the adulterous eyes. To that subtle power he went into. Even not only the mind but even the adulterous eyes. Even if you have adulterous eyes, he will not live here: he said it clearly. It’s an insult! It’s just to make Him die in this place [Agnya] that they did all this.

It’s not regarded as good manners in India to be exposed like this: very bad manners it is! Now you ask these girls - they will tell you, they have been to India - how women live and how they behave. Actually you meet all wrong type of people here. 

But you were also [once dharmic] like that. It’s all been spoilt only recently. Funny ideas of modernism of using women. I mean, one should feel ashamed! And that’s how the women, when they lose their power, the whole nation collapses. It’s only on the women, their power, the nation exists: on their sense and their wisdom. And they become so aggressive! Now this boy has a mother who is so aggressive! Terrible people! Is she better now?

I know, I know how they are. I have seen them - most surprising. A mother has to be extremely loving and tolerant and wise and should respect her chastity. I mean, it’s an abuse in India if somebody says about the mother, and here it’s surprising, he’s saying that everybody has relationship with the mother. What to do now? Are we a different type of a people or some funny, funny people who are born in that country where it’s an abuse. If you say that [in India] you can be murdered for that! Perhaps maybe in the law it may not be permissible if you say that in India to someone. Hmm. Horrible!

Now first I used to think that this Muktanand is only using that money and publicity and all that so I said, “Let him have money, whatever he wants. Doesn’t matter.” But then when his disciples started coming to me I realised he had spoiled their Kundalini. Then I was very angry with him. Because that is the primule, you see. That is how you are going to get your second birth. And he’s spoiling that! And for so many of you would never have got it, for many lives the way he has spoilt. Some of them he has spoilt very badly.

Now there’s a problem we have with this man, bald headed gentleman who comes. I don’t know if he’ll get it. He gets it but it drops down. You see, his Kundalini drops down, drops down. When he [Muktanand] touches the Kundalini, he makes the chakras so loose that the Kundalini comes up and after some time drops down.

Now.

Yah! Come along! How are you? How is Ravi? (1:17:30 Short Hindi conversation with Ravi) For his treatment? Woooow! He’s gone for his treatment or what has he gone for?

When he got there?

Ravi: Kuch ?? .

Shri Mataji: Kaise abhi?  (How is he now?)

Ravi: Bas, kharab hai. (Still sick) Us ka tabiyat. (His health)

Shri Mataji: Bahut kharab (very sick). Bahut usne safaya. (He cleared a lot). Ghar mein chalna chaahiye (He should walk in the house). Ghar mein, main chalana chaahiye (At home I also have to walk)

Ravi: (Hindi)

Shri Mataji: Aisa hai. Ye sach hi baat (That’s very true). That style of people, very thin, angry. 

Ravi: (Hindi)

Shri Mataji: No, no. You cannot. You leave it too much. You cannot change him.It’s really not possible you know. 

I got it from him. Now which one is yours? Now come along. I could bring chocolate for you only! All for the Sahaj Yogis is a good idea. But, you see, I could bring you chocolates. Today we have dinner for you, I must announce beforehand. You see, we have dinner but cook it now.

Marie: It’s already cooked.

Yogini: Marie has done it.

Shri Mataji: Oh! Already been cooked. So there is dinner for us.

Marie: Only the vegetables are not cooked.

Shri Mataji: Ah, come along. You see the other day, Gavin said a very sweet thing: he was angry with me. When I went away in the morning time, he came on my foot and his Agnya was caught. I said, “Why are you angry?” So he said, “I was very angry Mother because you didn’t keep them for food!” I said, “Well, you should have told me! I was thinking you had no food in the house!” And they wanted to go, so I said, “Alright go now!” I didn’t offer them any food. And I was very happy, you see. The whole day yesterday I was very joyous to see his generosity about it. And the way he was angry, it was a correct way to get angry with me. I love it that way, if you angry that [way]. You see, he had brought for everyone and he was very unhappy that he couldn’t give food, you know.

How are you? Fine?

Have you removed the water? Now remove it! Take out the water and wipe your feet. No, let him wipe! You put yourself on the side here. And then you have to take yourself that water into the WC, alright?

Are you better now? No?

Seeker: I’m not sure.

Shri Mataji: A little cool in the hands? Not yet?

No you come here, I will feel what’s the problem. Hmm. You must see the vibrations coming. Ha?

It’s better now. But what is behind here I want to see.

You see the trouble is more with the ??? and they have to get out.

Agnya? Now, are you feeling cool breeze in the hands? Let’s see now, now you have been cleared. Sit down. Aaaah!

You see the vibrations of this person, just see. Take a bandhan and see for yourself. Turn around. Just see now.

Are you lighter now?

Cooly is at the back.

Feel very good?

Marie: I feel a little bit cool on this hand there.

Shri Mataji: I mean we’ve removed this quite a lot. But you won’t be alright till your father is alright because you are catching from him you see. Our father and mother, both are built within us.

Hello, how are you? Good! Good!

So nobody is going away without eating, alright? And at the time when you want to get up to eat, you can eat.

And I’m just eating your bhoots all the time! (laughing) Ha!

For me it’s alright, I’m never hungry.

So you have met some friends of his?

Marie: Not really, no.

Shri Mataji: Hello! How are you? May God bless you! She has not yet come, your wife?

Bogdan Shehovych: Not today, she wants to talk to her sister.

Shri Mataji: I knew that. She has a big problem. Sit down. See his vibrations.

Bogdan : The whole day I was just cramped here. It was burning in Left Swadishthana. My whole left side was just aching but I was still in thoughtless awareness, when I was watching TV in the evening I sort of sensed some badha or something coming into superego. I had a sympathetic shock and I ran off to eliminate my bowels. Anyway, I just looked at it. I wasn’t liking it much but I looked at it and in the morning I was good. But it’s getting irritating. It doesn’t want to stop.

Shri Mataji: Now, if I told you about your friend you would not have been used to that. But you see how terrible they are! Their contamination is so terrible that it is better to know about them. You see, this experience is necessary also, because otherwise how can anybody know? They will think that, “Mataji is telling about everyone like that.” But you see whatever is a disease or whatever is a contamination, you must know about.

Ha! Better now. Heart? Left? Oh God! Just give him a bandhan. All [of] you put your hand on your heart. Right hand on your heart.

(1:29 - Hindi conversation with Ravi)

Hello, come along! How are you now? Really? You put your right hand there, you take it off.

Only with thirteen years, how many times he must have hugged me, isn’t it?

And what is he going to do there? Ruin so many people for his ‘treatment’?

Bogdan: But he doesn’t know it, he doesn’t care. He doesn’t know it. Anyway, I want to forget him.

Shri Mataji: But it is very necessary for anybody who is responsible, that if you do not know something then you just don’t do it! You must know about what you do. I mean, you just don’t jump into something that is so unknown; I mean, for anyone who feels responsible for his own life and responsible for everything. Isn’t it? You should do what you know and what you do not know you should not do. I mean, going to that extent without knowing from where he’s getting his powers.

Bogdan : He thinks it’s his higher self, his intuition.

Shri Mataji: How does he know it is his self?

Bodgan Shehovych: He doesn’t know.

Shri Mataji: Kahata Kabira ananda bhaiyo bhai, bhaje ko anahata ???

As you go, joy, to pulsate, first you get it as the truth, and then it comes to you as joy.

Absolutely like this? Ha!  Is it better?  Haa! Huun! You can now feel it. Better?

(End of tape 2 recording)

Tape 3

Lady: Now why do they come these people which gives so much distance to the human beings, they must be very bad.

Shri Mataji: Satans! You see, as the God has to give you love and joy and happiness, they have to give you all the unhappiness. They are sadists. They enjoy that. If you can understand a sadist of the cruelest way, they are that.

Lady: But how could that appear in the Creation.

Shri Mataji: That’s the problem. What happens is that, at a certain stage, human beings are given a freedom. At this evolutionary stage of human beings that they choose bad. You see, this is the main point.

Lady: Yeah but how to make the rights in the world then?

Shri Mataji: And because you are free to choose between the two.

Lady: No, but if you say ‘Satanic powers’ then they must get their powers...

Shri Mataji: They are not powers, I don’t call them powers. They are not powers. They should not be called as powers.

Lady: But how can they exist in a perfect Creation.

Shri Mataji: They can! You see, the thing is, I tell you: if you see in a car, there’s a brake and an accelerator, alright? So the brake has to work also. You go to a point of indiscrimination then you have to be thrown out; there should be some way of expulsion. Actually it’s the excretion of the Virat. And there has has to be excretion.

The whole thing has to be seen at this stage: where are they these people, where are you people. There are devatas on the right hand side, there are ganas on the left hand side. I am making you sit here and now it is for you people to put the balance.

Oh God! When can I eat so much!

Marie: What you don’t eat you can give to other people as prasad.

Shri Mataji: I think you [should] give Bogdan to read Gregoire’s book so that...

?? thinks he’s more powerful than Gregoire’s is.

Though he also sees these things coming. If all the time eating them, I must say. This is such a lot. How can I eat? They are not eating at all! All of you can go and eat.

Yogi: There’a a big crowd of them there’s not room there.

Shri Mataji: Now how are you? Feeling better?

Yogi: Erm, I still have tensions.

Shri Mataji: Too much?

Yogi: A lot.

Yogini: Actually Mataji I have to go soon.

Shri Mataji: Get her something to eat. What will you have? What should I give you? Alright.

Yogini: Thank you.

Irish Man: Mataji, there are so many teacher, swamis, sages etcetera, etcetera, how are we to know who are good and who are bad?

Shri Mataji: You have to use your brains all the time. For example, it’s very easy to flout Mahesh Yogi. You should ask him, and he must tell you, how does he do, what is the system behind it; by taking the name, how it works out; how can it be. Better ask him. It’s not written in the books at all that by taking somebody’s name you become trance. He doesn’t talk of God, he doesn’t talk of Christ. How does he relate himself to Christ? After all it was not created to be a waste. Are they all wasted? Mohammed Sahib, Christ is wasted? Everybody wasted? Only this Mahesh yogi is the only person? Use your brains.

Irish Man: You see it’s only in the later writings of Mahesh yogi that he’s not mentioned God because his system is orientated towards businessmen etc. But in the early days he did speak of God.

Shri Mataji: You see, actually they come out in their true spirits. You should say, “You are inconsistent! How you started with God and how you finished it off.” Whatever I said the first day I must say today also. Use your brains! How can you change? “In the beginning you used it as a camouflage, how can you give up God now?” 

Irish Man: I’m sorry I persist, but I still have the ?? from Maharishi you see, although I’m here through Raj. But, the way it is explained now is because not enough people were coming to meditation because they are not attracted to the spiritual thing, the spiritual side of it. But the way he has explained it is that the end is justified by the means. So if it means that more people would come to meditation and perhaps spiritual understanding without the mention of [God].

Shri Mataji: But this is great for him to say all this! He’s handling thousands of people! He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. How can you depend on a man like that? A captain: the ship doesn’t know, perhaps the ship may go this way or that way!

You see if you listen to him it’s so insulting. You can find him out, in no time you can find them out, very easy.

Irish Man: The thing is you never get the chance to talk to him.

Shri Mataji: This is maintained! He never talks to anyone.

Irish Man: Only his teachers.

Shri Mataji: You know I asked somebody who is a very close relation of ours and a very big man. I asked him, “Do you talk to him?” He said, “No! Whenever I talk to him I am drunk.” Nanaka said you should not drink. Everybody said you should not drink. Even Christ in a way. Moses was told not to drink. Everywhere it is known that it goes against awareness. Then how is it [when] he calls himself ‘Transcendental Consciousness’ and how can it be ‘consciousness’ which goes against it. Every one of his disciples can drink, can do what they like, they can have three girlfriends or ten girlfriends, makes no difference: that means whole of Bible is wrong, Koran is wrong, Gita is wrong, all shastras are wrong?

Irish Man: He has done a translation of the first six chapters of the Bhagavad Gita.

Shri Mataji: And what is so difficult [in that] ?

Irish Man: Oh, no, I’m not saying it is difficult.

Shri Mataji: No, but what I’m saying [is that] that’s what they did. In the beginning even Rajneesh started talking about God, you will be amazed. In the beginning they wrote. How do you make out a thief? When he comes out in his two colours! Not when he is camouflaged. They have to camouflage. Now, if I’m saying today something, and after ten years if I say something else, you must understand. There’s something wrong, this is inconsistent.

Irish Man: Yes.

Shri Mataji: And a person who’s supposed to be the spiritual leader at least should not be inconsistent, minimum of minimum. Then his own persona: so much interested in money! How can a person? Can he? That too, other people’s money!

It’s a big organisation: he’s got some of the big bureaucrats from India employed by him.

Mrs Devi: One of my relatives also, he’s one of America’s greatest scientists, my niece’s husband - he’s running around him.

Shri Mataji: And K.B. Lal! Of all the persons I cannot imagine a man like him. He’s such a brilliant man, he’s all been befooled by him. And I asked him what did you talk to him? And he said, “No whenever I talk to him I’m drunk.” He drinks a lot himself now he’s started drinking so much this man, and also he’s become so hot tempered, ask him.

Mrs. Devi: I’ll show you my ?? letter which a very well known lady in Belgium has written. I’m so glad he’s left our country.

Shri Mataji: He was a very nice sweet tempered person.

Seeker: Myself, all I got was good from it when I was doing it. When I was doing T.M. I had good experiences, I felt very good.

Shri Mataji: Felt very good? The reason I’ll tell you, why he felt good. That is true, you feel good in a way. In a way you do. That’s the camouflage. What happens [is] a spirit comes into you. It’s like you see, if somebody gets drunk, he will say, “I  felt very good with the drink.” It’s something like that. You see, somebody else takes over from you, you are not yourself, so you feel nice. To be yourself, without Realisation, is a difficult situation.

Seeker: When can we know that we do not have a spirit in us?

Shri Mataji: You will know, now, see. If you had a spirit you would see yourself, separated. Start seeing the spirit separated, absolutely. You will see, and now you will know how to face that. That’s what it is. You will not only know that but you will know all obstructions within you and you will cleanse also. This is Self-realisation: you should know yourself absolutely: where is the spirit which is come into us.

Gavin: I was trying to reason that answer out: the first thing is that you can feel your own chakras and your own centres and you can tell whether you are alright or not, that’s the first thing.

Shri Mataji: First thing.

Gavin: Second thing is that you get collective consciousness. In other words you can feel what other people’s chakras are like. And once it starts that you can really recognise that this is fact, that you are feeling their chakras and you can tell that this is their Agnya that is blocked, and it ties up because they’ve been to T.M. or it ties up because they wear glasses, or it ties up because they don’t forgive their parents for having a fight, then you know that you’ve got collective consciousness.

Shri Mataji: The proof is there! Of course, absolutely. Absolutely.

Gavin: The first thing is that you can feel your own chakras.

Shri Mataji: The first thing for a child also! Anybody! Now you are feeling your own chakras you see for yourself: now feel which finger is burning.

Seeker: Burning?

Shri Mataji: Ha, burning. Are you getting cool breeze?

Seeker: Slight.

Shri Mataji: But there’s an obstruction that you are feeling on one finger or two fingers?

Seeker: It’s feeling here.

Shri Mataji: Absolutely! That is Mahesh Yogi! Left Agnya, the left hand side and the superego.

Yogi: Heart.

Seeker: And what does that mean?

Shri Mataji: Heart. This is heart: heart organ itself. What is the mantra he gave? What mantra he gave you?

Seeker: I’m not really supposed to reveal it. I’m not really supposed to speak it out.

Yogi: He says he’s not supposed to speak it out.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, you tell me. Better tell me that mantra.

Seeker: Umbium.

Shri Mataji: Umbium?

Mrs Devi: Somebody else also had the same mantra.

Shri Mataji: Umbium, yes he gives it. That’s the name of a devil.

Umbium is a mantra...is the left hand side, on the heart. Left, left side, that’s why you are catching on the left.

Seeker: Was it given to help that? Was the mantra given to help that?

Shri Mataji: Now supposing he gives you a real mantra of Rama, alright? Take it like that. He’s a devil and he’s not supposed to do all that. Alright, first of all you’ll bend your head before him and take the mantra, accept it, now you start using that, without authority. Without authority if you try to meet someone who is so high as that, even queen, you cannot meet her. And if you enter into it, you will be caught, police will catch hold of him and put you in the jail. It’s that same sort of a thing it is. You just go on taking Rama’s name, first you see there’s a little temper, there’s something they show temper, they try to correct you, they try to improve you, everything, but still you don’t listen, so they disappear completely sleeps off, Rama sleeps off, on the right hand side - immediately.

He will also tell you some ways by which you spoil it even more. Say, if you are rude to father and you go and tell him, “I’m rude to my father,” he will say, “It’s alright. Forget about it. Don’t you worry.” So it will be all more spoilt. Now he asks you to take the name of Ram, then there’s a devil by that name [so] he comes and sits there. He has got regular armies of people like that! ‘Umbium’ and all these things are certain names given to certain lieutenants of his and he has got some armies with him.

Seeker: But how can a sound like ‘Om’ be used for any kind of harm? ‘Om’, how can that be used against someone?

Shri Mataji: Because it is a name of someone. You see, it is a name. Now supposing you sit down here and take the name of “Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram” - He’s not your servant to come! He’s not at your beck and call! You see? He will not come. You have to enter into His awareness, you have to come into His awareness, you have to rise much higher to be in His presence, isn’t it? How can you just go on calling His name like that? And what happens is that somebody by the name, servant by the name of Ram, only can come. And this servant is arranged by Mr. Mahesh Yogi and he comes in and settles down there and he controls you. And when he controls you you feel nice and happy because somebody else is doing the job, and you give up all your money, everything, whatever you have.

Irish Man: It still creates a problem for me Mataji because even a puja, no matter who’s puja, even your puja, how would I know that that was going to happen. Of course to you it isn’t, but having been told that somebody else’s puja or somebody else’s mantra would have harmed me, how am I to know?
