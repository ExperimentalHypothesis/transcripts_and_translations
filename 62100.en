Now, so, too much. [laughter]

Yogi: I have something too, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] funny, you're not yet married.

Yogi: Something simple but... It's from Greece, its candles! Made out of 100% pure Ghee.

Shri Mataji: Ahuh. Look [how] wonderful they're.

Yogi: They take like twelve hours for one to burn.

- Shri Mataji: Is it.

Yogi: Very good to put on overnight and then for fires.

Shri Mataji: Very nice for Pujas. Greece has some very miraculous things. All right, thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: All right let us do some talking.

Yogi: Mother, can be kept closed.

Shri Mataji: What is the next thing we will be follow on, will have to do. So whose translating?

Yogis: Mmm [Willman UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: All right so we have to do the translation also to these people about what are we going to do next, all right. First thing is that now there will be people coming, those who are coming, new people. And tend to new people you have to remember one thing that you should not, try to impress on them that you are something better than them.

Those who are already much better because their valiancy has gone up there, so this valiancy eleven, twelve like that, you see. In truth, valiancy.

Translator Yogi: [UNaudible]

Yogi: Yes the ten commandments was there, the ten balance in there after the realisation but more valiances, it can give you realisation -

Shri Mataji: First of them can realisation to them.

Translator Yogi: Witness.

Shri Mataji: And also you can give vibrations to matter to say, your trees, the flowers. You can give vibrations to them.

Translator Yogi: Living things or also undead things? Can I give vibrations to undead things also?

Shri Mataji: Yes, they all get vibrated, now see if I'm sitting here then the vibrations come if i'm putting my feet here, there's vibrations. I must tell you about Hazrat Mohammed.

Translator Yogi: Shall I first translate -

Shri Mataji: First you tell them.

Now, about Hazrat Mohammed, once I went to Kashmir with my husband and we were going in one direction.

Translator Yogi: Do you mean Hazrat Mohammed or -

Shri Mataji: No I was going there. And a very like, a wilderness, it was like a jungle and there I felt tremendous vibrations.

Translator Yogi: Is vibrations?

Shri Mataji: I felt vibrations and I told my husband that there must be some very holy place somewhere. So I told the driver, I said to take the car this way. But he said ''there's nothing here, you see, nothing here''. He was saying, driver was saying. So we reached a place where there was some Muslims, very poor Muslims were living in a [ditch UNCLEAR]. So we asked them is there any temples here, what is this place you see? They said '' No but about a mile away there is Hazrat Akbar''.

So one hair of Mohammed Hazrat is kept there in that place, one hair. And I got his vibrations at least five miles ahead. I felt the vibrations five miles away from there. So vibrations are that tremendous. Have you see my photograph or poster up, all of them?

Yogi: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: You have seen?

A yogi translating and repeating what Shri Mataji asked.

Translator Yogi: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: You have seen? No, no of my Sahasrara being shown?

Yogi: Did you see the ones with the Sahasrara open?

Translator Yogi: Yes, yes.

Yogi: Carla showed them.

Shri Mataji: So you can imagine how powerful is the light, that everything vanished but just my Sahasrara was showing. Have you seen it?

Yogi: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: Sure. So the vibrations are a very powerful thing and they know everything, they know everything.

Shri Mataji speaking hindi or marathi.

And their whole thing was - she can't see, she's short so she can't see. So their action is such that they know everything and they know how to act. They will guide you and they will protect you but know you must know that you have a new awareness of a vibratary awareness.

You see and you must use that. If you don't use your vibratary awareness then with human awareness you will be making mistakes. So for everything you must use your vibrations to find out what is it. Now the problems comes in when you have new people because they watch you.

What have you achieved? How you look? How you behave? How you talk? And suddenly you should not tell them that you are caught up, you've got a bhoot in you like that you see. On the contrary you should be very gentle and very hospitable because now they are just coming, they see your behaviour and then only they realise that they are some special people. And never argue in their presence. Now supposing he says something, now one should not say ''No, no this is not so'' in the presence of others but support each other. And also you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga in the beginning not about Me, much. And you have to - you can have a course also we are now having courses for chakras, every chakra per day we are having courses like that so they get deeper and deeper into it.

Then you can something to them otherwise they can, they can you see, first they try to judge you people. Now you will be amazed when I come, always I don't know why there will be thousands of people everywhere. I don't know what happens maybe the vibrations work it out, I don't know. Because I when to a place like Colombia where nobody knows Me, nothing of the kind, you see. And even outside of the hall in the garden there was such a crowd, I didn't know how to get inside. But then for the follow on very few came and then gradually they started to the introducing.

Translator Yogi: You mean very few came to courses?

Yogi: Yes for follow up...

Shri Mataji: Yeah, but this, you see this is the try of the Paramchaitanya I think so that when you people are perfect, everything is fine, you're all right then the Paramchaitanya itself organises to a certain point. Chaitanya, He's this all pervading power. So it is important that you should also meditate, you all should meditate. And you should also go deep. And they - your ascent is such a thing that as if like the sari you lift it to see the whole things come out like that. Once you ascend the whole of [UNCLEAR collectivity] will start coming out. So it's a very big responsibility and I am sure you will work it out. Now if you have any problems you tell me.

Translator Yogi: He has a question, he says sometimes my finger becomes cold and sometimes hot, sometimes there is a tingling. Are all of them -

Shri Mataji: All the fingers or one? One finger.

Translator Yogi: [UNCLEAR different fingers]. Examples he says.

Shri Mataji: So now you should know you are a recording machine like a barometer. You shouldn't worry about that but you should know that there is somebody like that or some atmosphere like that is there that you're catching, somebody around you or sitting next to you or...

[UNCLEAR yes yes just a minute] my husband is there. You'll be sitting there, there's no need for you to go away.

So now this is a feeling, go on seeing, go on feeling like that you see. So you are just recording it.

Translator Yogi: He means...

Shri Mataji: If he feels anywhere just recording you see but one should not fall into too much about this.

Translator Yogi: He means if he feels cold or if he feels hot or if he feels pulsating or if he feels tickling all over his [unclear hands unclear]

Shri Mataji: If you feel hot, means something is wrong with the person, if he's feeling cool and nice it's all right. But if he's pulsating that means he's, is about to get his - he's capable of getting vibrations by being cleansing.

Translator Yogi: Good vibes.

Shri Mataji: Ah but not very good but he's capable as the vibrations are working as pulsation means that he might get realisation but he should not pay so much attention because if you go on every time judging you'll go mad.

Translator Yogi: Yeah. If he's numb, no?

Shri Mataji: One should not try to - sort of mental too much think about it. Yeah.

Shri Mataji: And also one should not [UNCLEAR]... walking on the street, might see somebody feel their cool, you might feel their hot, you might feel anything. Then you should not just go and ask him about it or something because you have to do it very carefully. Everybody is not worthy of realisation, you have do to it very carefully. You can come to program, they are there then gradually you can but on the street here, there if you go on then there will be problems. Because you are realised souls and they're not.

Like here is too much smoking as I've seen people have too much smoking and with smoking you catch Vishuddhi both the Vishuddhi's very much all the time. The reason is then you smoke you also feel guilty because smoke is right Vishuddhi because you feel guilty, left Vishuddhi. Yes all right. Then also that see when talking to them about their gurus so immediately you should not sort of jump on them. But you should just slowly say that see if this guru business doesn't work out in Sahaja Yoga, very gradually. 

And it effects you because you should quarrel with them or fight with them or if you talk to much from them. You may catch from them. So if anybody is having a guru or anything, first don't try their difficult words but try easier ones. Or just tell them that they should put the left hand forwards the photograph, towards the light and say that ''Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru'' like that. 'I am my own master'. So that they will clear out. Once they have cleared out they should be - then it's all right. But otherwise they'll argue with you, what's wrong with this person? Why not? This, that, they will go on arguing. So an argument doesn't give realisation, doesn't give. Also they'll ask you this book we have read, that book we have read. Have you read this book or not? That book have you read or not? You should say by reading book its doesn't work out. In a humble way, in a humble way. Also you can do one more thing, that I also read a lot but it didn't work out, if you take it upon yourself, they will not feel hurt.

Yogi: Have to say we have also -

Shri Mataji: - I've read lots of books.

Yogi: - read lots of books and didn't help us.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So in the beginning it's a little difficult but gradually things will improve, I'm sure. 24:01 But you must meditate, morning, evening both days, both times you must meditate.

Translator Yogi: Morning and evening.

Shri Mataji: Morning, yes. Morning just without water, you can just sit down before the photograph but don't close your eyes, keep your eyes open, feel the vibrations, know what chakras are catching and try to correct them. And in the evening again before sleeping you put your feet in the water, then foot soak yourself, meditate and sleep. And some people believe that we'll do it in our house privately, it doesn't work! You see you have to be in the collective -

Translator Yogi: You have to be?

Shri Mataji: You have to be in the collective, you must attend programs. It's very important. Because it's like this you see that when you churn the yogurt then the butter comes up. And you put a little butter in it, you see and collect all the butter. But all the particles which are left out, are of no use they are lost. So we have to be in the collective, we must meet.

If you do not attend programs, you cannot grow.

Shri Mataji: Yes?

Translator Yogi: Since he landed to Turkey he cannot think anything. He thinks, he said his head is empty.

Shri Mataji: But that's good. That's the best, if you are in - when you are in thoughtless awareness then you grow spiritually.

Translator Yogi: When he is working he cannot concentrate on work.

Shri Mataji: No you see there is, you feel that way but everything will be worked out. There was a lady who used to run a shop and she knew each and everything what was in the shop and all that. Then she did not remember anything and she was still selling things and she made five times more profit.

Translator Yogi: After realisation?

Shri Mataji: No.

Yogi: After realisation?

Shri Mataji: After realisation, yes. You are looked after. No, no you are no need, no need to use your brains. Everything will be done.

Translator Yogi: It will be alright.

Shri Mataji: You are in peace and everything is worked out. There's no need to concentrate at all, somebody - like the whole thing is concentrating for you. On second demand. All right everybody will notice that, miracles after miracles. What is your question?

Yogi: Because of the Muslims don't for example pray to one picture to things like that. In Turkey since we for example make one puja, the first puja it was alright. After we make the first puja it was all of us and some of them go away. No it is -

Shri Mataji: No, no should not, actually puja should be introduce very late. That should be very few people should do puja. Everybody cannot also do puja.

Yogi: Okay.

Shri Mataji: It is very difficult. Anyone you see when we do not allow anybody to do puja, they at least have two years in Sahaja Yoga.

Yogi: Yes, yes all right.

Shri Mataji: Two years they have to be. At least two years. Even from Russian I told them that only ones who are being in this thing for quite sometime should be brought to India otherwise no pujas allowed, not allowed. I mean Mohammed Sahib said it that til you get your [UNCLEAR turiya] state you should not - you can go on doing [UNCLEAR allows namars] and all that, til that not after that. Til your resurrection.

Translator Yogi: Til your resurrection?

Shri Mataji: Til your resurrection you should do all  [UNCLEAR namars] and all these restrictions and everything but after resurrection, nothing he said so. No need.

Translator Yogi: Our realisation, no? Til our realisation?

Shri Mataji: After your realisation is your resurrection, Kya baat 31:16. Now you're resurrected so there is no need for you to do anything which has been said tabooed or stopped even now, Quran. That is still you get your resurrection. Now you are free!

Translator Yogi: Yes is it not necessary...

Shri Mataji: Yes that, all that it has to be done, all these restrictions are there for women, men everything is there til you get your resurrection to build up your dharma, to build up your sustenance. And Islam, Islam means to surrender. Surrender to truth, it means surrender to truth, to truth. And in the Quran it is also written that be careful there will be many who are non believers and will be many who are argumentative, yeah.

But once you know you have found the truth then you must surrender to truth. So first you must know you have found the truth, you should be sure about it. Then only you can surrender. Then you go beyond everything, you become a universal being. Yes, it's a - when I have see the Jews worshipping Hazat Momat and the Muslims worshipping the Shri Rama something like that. In the name of religion how can anybody fight. But going on like that the fanatics are there, the fanaticism is there but that shows that they're blind. But now as you have got the light, you must live with confidence. All right.

Yogi: When making - for example meditation in when the new people come to the program, a some of them also must be sent or some other people sent over or they come by themselves? Like for example Abraham or for example I was. For example I was for three months somewhere but if I was ten years or [UNCLEAR] these people won't comes and make mediation in us, I've seen these days also I understand, I speak with Ackbar, with Mr.Ankit that or the cool breeze gets more, more long, not easily. So these people broke our vibrations they don't come early.

Shri Mataji: What's he saying?

Yogi: So they must put them out -

Another Yogi: He's saying that when we meditate there is one person from [rational] domination which is ten years there, he's meditating with us, he disturb our meditation.

We feel this [day/way unclear], Mother, we feel this day more -

Shri Mataji: But if he's meditating, you just tell him. You meditate with left hand towards the photograph with the light and right hand on the Mother earth so he clears out then he won't disturb you and you take a bhandan yourself, you cover yourself up, you see. Because poor thing he is a seeker, transcendental fellow is a seeker and the mistake is gone, we must try to save. That's the point. Just stand up.

This is it, [UNCLEAR] not, not difficult so much. TM people are not so difficult of course in the beginning they might shake or something. They're easier but the [UNCLEAR] people are horrible.

Translator Yogi: What do you understand when he speak about Deities.

Shri Mataji: About what?

Translator Yogi: The manifestation of God, you say manifestation of God, what does it mean?

Another Yogi: Deities, I think she wants to know about the Deities?

Shri Mataji: See they are aspects of God. They are aspects of God, you see. 38:01 But for that you need not talk just now, you talk in a general way.

Is this your son? Is it, come along. Hello, how do you do? May God bless. Such a sweet [UNCLEAR thing/kid] So...

Translator Yogi: So we talked about that afterwards, not now?

Shri Mataji: What about? Just now you talk about Sahaja Yoga.

Another Yogi: To the new people she meant.

Translator Yogi: No to us, she wants to learn.

Another Yogi: No.

Translator Yogi: She says, what does it mean the aspects of Divine manifestation of God or what does it mean she says.

Another Yogi: She wants to know what does it mean the Deities, Shes the aspects, different aspects of God.

Shri Mataji: See actually in our evolutionary process there has been an incarnation one after another. And like [UNCLEAR Momat Zabat/Sahib] not said has not been before. So at different stages of evolution these incarnations came forward to lead us into higher awareness, one after another.

Translator Yogi: All of the people are incarnating or only the - if you are elected pupil?

Shri Mataji: No, no, you see human beings are different, these are a principal. You see the principal which incarnates. You see the principal, I'm talking about Deities. Deities is a principal that incarnates. The principal of a - human beings also can't be God but these Deities are. They incarnate because its a principal, the principal of incarnation mostly are done by the principal of Akbar, means the Virat.

Translator Yogi: What? Akbar is God.

Shri Mataji: Akbar which is, we call it Allahu Akbar, yes. Now, so that principal incarnates mostly. To lead us in our awareness.

Translator Yogi: To?

Shri Mataji: To lead us further with our awareness. Like first it came as a fish, fish. Then it came as a tortoise, like that.

Translator Yogi: The Deities you mean come as a fish and then?
