1981-10-15 Public Program Day 1, Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ, Los Angeles (United States)

Yesterday I told you that we have within us two very important powers.The first power is the power of desire by which we desire called as “iccha shakti” in sanskrit language and the another power which is called as the “kriya power” or we can say the power of action.These two are really gross(not clear) powers which are expressed outside as sympathetic nervous system,Left and Right sympathetic nervous system.The central path is called the “Sushumana Nadi”, the channel of our ascent.This channel represents our evolution through ages.We can say that this channel is responsible for giving us our evolution from amoeba to this stage as a human being, and all the centres that you see there one, two, three four, five ,six, seven all of them are the milestones in our progress, in our evolution.These are all placed within us, the subtle centres are there,they are all there and we are made up of this beautiful instrument.we are not aware of it of course we are not aware also we can’t see them because they are subtle centres and we can not see with our naked eyes.we can only see the manifestation of these centres outside as gross(not clear) plexuses.Now today as i told you yesterday i will be dealing with each centre one by one and i will tell you what these centres represent within us.Now the very first centre is the centre of our innocence,before creating us before creating this universe innocence was created.Innocence is the most powerful power on this earth.Innocence is love, innocence is god and innocence is the only thing that really keeps us going in this horrible world in which we are born.This innocence we find in the matter,matter is innocent.if you hit the matter it will hit you. If you don't hit it, it is alright.You can change the form of the matter, you see, in the, say for this hall it won't trouble you,if you are here it will give you a shade,if you want you can use it for disturbing others for destroying others, the way you want to use it you can use it because it doesn't say anything to us, so at this centre is the carbon element which started doing within us,we can say the carbon is in the centre of the whole system of elements, carbon is in the centre because it is tetravalent element as you know it has got four valencies and when carbon came in this existence then only life would be produced and this centre is thus is the centre where we became really tetravalent means we became a,  an element by which we could become human beings we could become the living things.the living things started when carbon came into existence.so this centre is very important because this centre represents that stage of human evolution where we became living human beings.before this we were dead people, we were just like these stones and things that you see around. After that is the,i told you that centre about that i talked to you yesterday after that you have the second centre of our seeking when when an animal came into being he started seeking,first he started seeking the food,for example the unicellular animals likes like amoeba and all that they just seek food, they do not seek anything else but food and that is the beginning of our seeking.so the first grosses(not clear) seeking was food, where we started seeking something for our growth,for our nutrition.The second seeking started when some of the animals felt that they were too big for their sizes they couldn't move around and they found it impossible to do something about it. Now we can say that even before these animals were made before that the fishes themselves were surrounded by land and one of the fishes had to come up, the future that was going to happen,in these chaotic conditions and confusions we started seeking more and more, and the real seeking is that of pure.of course we must say that the play of seeking is not only human there is also god’s play it is god who wants you to seek, it is god who wants you to get your realization,you are the epitome of his creation human beings are the highest that he has created do you see how beautifully he has created in thousands of years from amoeba from carbon for an ordinary say from an hydrogen atom you have become like this, there must be some purpose some reason why God has made you like this,it's not just a wasteful,purposeless activity of god but what is the purpose of God why did he do it nobody thinks about it.scientist of course they being honest they say we can not find out so forget about it.Whatever they can not find out and reason out they just don't discuss.so one has to see whether there is some reason or not or is there any purpose in our life or are we to come on this earth and just to die like any other animal and have no gains in our human awareness.This question has been arising into the minds of thousands of people thousands of people and at this time as you know the market was full with the idea that we have to seek so the market got flooded with all kinds of people who wanted to market it.i mean its automatic.There are marketeers for everything,you want something,you will find marketeers just coming around and that's how it happened and they took advantage of the simplicity and of the i would say navity of the people and they misused them and mislead them,they could not understand how god can be organised by these people how,whether they were the contractors of God or how could they talk of God,what was the sign and symptom of a person who comes to you and says that I am god and you should receive this things from me.What we believe in was the superficial, superficial appearances like a person has a 58 Rolls Royce,he must be a great man, not a saint, the saint does not have any rolls royces we could not see that .see for us it was very much great that he lives in a big mansion not the saint.The Saint doesnt want mansions he can live on the street for him it does not matter whether its a mansion or a street makes no difference to him and this is the simple thing that they did not know about a saint and they got impressed by all these things like media and the way they put up the show and circus that they can.This is the saddest part of the whole story and that's how our seeking was mislead.Today i would like to say about this chakra especially that is the what we called the “Nabhi chakra” is the central part of our evolution where you start your seeking and you crossover to otherside.Now surrounding this you will find there is the ocean of illusion and this ocean of illusion was covered by a deity by a special powerful personality who we called as the “Dattatreya”is the Primordial master and he incarnated on this earth many a times at the time of Christ even before that he incarnated as say Abraham, Moses,Socrates, Lao tzu,later on he incarnated as Mohammad sahab then the same great principle incarnated as Nanaka then the same principle at the last incarnated as Sainath of Shirdi. So the same great principle of this Primordial master has incarnated because without a master how will you be taken away in a from this illusion how you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel.What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive more open ,awakened, enlightened to feel that all pervading power around you.Now this came again and again and told you that you must look after your “Dharma”.Dharma doesnt means any religion that is being established in the names of these people because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone they are great species(word not clear),all of them in essence are one and the same but like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and they when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt then people can claim this is my flower,this is my flower , flower everybody  has become a contractor of this thing.Actually these people belong to the whole Universe, they are universal beings and they came on this earth to give us a sustenance within us.A sustenance, Dharma means sustenance that is we can say that this quality that is human for example gold has a quality that is it is untarnishable carbon has a quality that it is tetravalent in the same way i would say human beings have four,ten valencies or we can say has a quality that they have to have these ten specialities in them so that they can be called as human beings.All these ten specialities are represented by the ten incarnations of this Primordial spirit on this earth.There are many others also spirits who came who are we can say followers of these or we can say the disciple incarnations of this great power which we called as Primordial Master and such a Primordial master is needed no doubt but such a primordial master has to have certain qualities if they are missing how is he going to be our master.A guru means a person who has got that weight in him,weight of virtues of qualities of righteousness of holiness a person who is not righteous who is a parasite who leads a bad life can not be your guru not only that but what is a guru’s speciality is that he makes you meet god,he connects you to God he does not connect you to all kinds of funny things that these guru’s are doing nowadays. On this point i have to tell you how the false people work it out and how the reality works out.Now if you see on the right hand side of this lies the power of your “kriya shakti” as your “action power”.Now what they do is they tell you that you start doing some sort of a jumping ,standing on your head or they may say take out your tongue this is the worst there was a guru here now he doesn't do that he is dead, but what he did in his lifetime he asked people to cut the tongue at the base and put the tongue back and do some sort of a trick called what i do not know called it a “khechdi”, all these nonsensical things people started doing to push your eyes down like that or  i don't know what else and to stand on your head, stand on one leg so all kinds of this tricks(laughing).You can not go to the god this, this is not the way to be done.This is not the way you can get to god it is such a spontaneous its a process that is living it can not work out by these tricks that people tell you do this do that this is not the way it is going to workout remember it will only workout if there is a spontaneous happening of kundalini awakening which is the holy mother you have gotll(not clear).She is the auspicious mother,she is the holy mother,she is not unholy and you can not not use it for any unholy purpose.Now we have lost the meaning of the word holy, we have lost the meaning of the word a, what you called the auspiciousness, we do not know what righteousness is in these modern times,these words sound so hollow and so funny, but you will be amazed that this exists within us whether you like it or not.If we do not get the blessings of holiness,you can not raise the ‘Kundalini’.Kundalini is a spontaneously is just like a seed that sprouts in the mother earth.In the same way when the warmth of holiness and auspiciousness is faced by a person then only the kundalini is going to rise.so any guru who comes and tells you that i give you a  realization you stands on your head you tell him you better go and stand till you get your realization.Then there are many other things they tell you they say that you will start flying now we have to understand all these nonsensical things why do we want to do why do we want to fly in the air we are already flying bit too much i mean just now i was coming in the sky i saw so many aeroplanes that i thought a day may come when you have to find some sort of a method of arranging the crossing of these aeroplanes and how the traffic has to be arranged even there.Now all such ideas that we are going to fly or somebody says that we become sort of a person who leaves the body and goes up and sees from there or somebody who sees the colours or who sees the aura this all these things seeing you can do otherwise it is not a seeing that is important as i told you saying that this is the truth there are many who says this is the truth you have to become the truth and the second thing you have to know today is that by seeing something you do not become.if you see something suppose if you are coming by the this road we saw this church but when we came in we don't  see it now. when you are away from it when we crossed the mountain we never saw it when we were on it we never saw it when we were away from it then we saw it so seeing something is not receiving that, is not to be, to be means in your awareness as he said in your central nervous system you must feel that you have become the spirit.Yesterday i told you about the spirit and what are the blessings of the spirits and how you get it but if your dharma is not alright supposing you have moved too much to the right side even a person who is a very busy man he has running the rat race he has no time for god he has no time for his spirit nothing he is running very fast alright you run fast and jump into the place where you have to go.you have to be in the centre not extreme action can take you to your real path and now if you take a car for example i mean in your practical life you always try to keep everything  in the centre in a sense your car can not run on a one sided wheels it has to have both the wheels on a chair you can not sit if it has only two legs on one side you can not sit our centre of gravity acts in the centre we in our normal life keep to the centre we can not walk with one side like this we have to put both the leg on the ground and walk on both the legs in the same way if you try to act on one side as i told you yesterday you can create a terrible imbalance especially in dharma it happens and that's why i am telling you today that any extreme behaviour on dharma is not needed.There is no need to go on madly calling God,oh God come along,people are saying mantras now any sort of mantra they take there is one guru who charges three hundred pounds and the mantra he gives means in the hindi language it is called as “thenga”when you show like this(Shri Mataji showing her right hand thumb),can u believe it and so many people are doing it paying 300 pounds i mean you tell any Indian and he will just laugh(Shri Mataji laughing) how can it be.Inga , inga in marathi language means tail of a scorpion, these are the mantras they are giving to you and you are paying three hundred pounds for that.Now the mantra can not be given like that, is a wrong idea that you give some mantra to somebody for example every sentence has a different mantra, every center has got a problem when the kundalini rises you know when you come say to the centre of shri krishna now you have to take the name of shri Krishna,if you come to centre of the gurus,of the Adiguru of the the sat guru then you have to take the name of satgurus.Satguru means the one who is the real guru, the one who is the real master then you have to take their names but if you are taking the name of some one person for example say we take the name of Rama,now where is the centre of Rama,you can see that centre of Rama is on the right side of the heart centre which is in the center.Now if you take the name of Rama and you have no problems you will get into problems its easiest way to get into the problems because Rama ,Shri Rama is a deity,you can not just take his name without any protocol.There is no rhyme and reason for example if i take the name of say the Governor of this place and just go before his house and starts shouting his name i don't know his name they will arrest me.In the same way if you take the name of Rama without having any protocol,without having any understanding you are first of all this center will be going(pointing towards her throat)because you will be taking the names means you are using your voice all the time unnecessarily and also the right side heart centre will be caught and all such people will suffer physically from asthma absolutely.If you have asthma trouble then you can find out that you are suffering from this Rama centre may be there is something wrong with your father,or may be something wrong with your fatherhood,or may be something that you are you are missing you father,or that your father has died,or something is wrong with that.Asthma can be cured as i told you yesterday only by taking Rama’s name but if you are asthma then name has to be taken by a realised soul.By a person who is empowered who has the protocol,who can talk to shri Rama in the sense who is connected.Any dick,tom and harry can not take his name.There is a protocol about it.Now in the same way gurus name also we can not take without protocol,we must have the protocol.Anybody who is all the time saying guru,guru,guru guru is not is not paying full attention to it ,neither he is respecting.I have seen people,they go against the teachings of guru,for example now we can say that all the gurus have taught one thing that you have to look after your awareness, awareness is in that area,awareness is nourished by liver.They are very anxious that your liver should be alright whatever they have taught they have tried to see that your liver should be alright and all he gurus have been against alcoholism.Any take you Moses,you take Abraham,you take Nanaka you take Mohammad sahab all of them are more worried about the liver than for anything else.Somebody asked me why didnt christ decry wine , he didn’t support it either but he had some other job to be done so he didn't talk about it but he never drank wine, i mean the wine in those days didn't mean fermented wine as you have.i mean people never used to smoke also in those days,at time of say Mohammad sahab there was no smoking so he never prohibited any smoking but he said no narcotics no nothing that goes against awareness should be taken so they said oh then they say there is nothing wrong in smoking then he took his birth the same principle took his birth as guru nanak and guru nanak then said no smoking and no drinking. why? Because they were worried about the awareness of a person if your awareness is not alright what's the use of giving you your realization,you are already not aware of it.Now drugs same thing if you take to drugs or anything like that you go down in your awareness is a fact you know. You get some may be if you take some drugs you may go to the right side and you might see colours like this but thats hallucination you go to the other side you may feel oh you are dying and something and you may go into the subconscious and the collective subconscious you may go on to the collective supra conscious on the right hand side but to go up you have to keep in the centre you have to be alert and your awareness should be normal,to keep it normal, to keep it in balance these people prescribe that you should not try to do anything that is too much “ati”(in Hindi).extremes should be avoided.but the result of that was just the opposite all the fanatics were born out of these teachings, imagine all the fanatics were born out of these teachings which were meant not to have any fanaticism.Actually if somebody is a fanatic he develops diseases of the stomach.Fanaticism gives you horrible diseases of the stomach.The other day we had a gentleman from Iran he is a doctor there and he had cancer,he came to know about me,he came to see me in London,and I told him that you do you believe that muhammad Sahab is the only one who can save the world , he said yes.Then i think he should have saved it,No but i think he is the only one who can save it he was the last one i said may be he might have been might have thought i am the last,but he must have seen the way you are behaving he must have taken his birth again,he could not keep it at that stage perhaps i said can u believe he came back as guru Nanak he said I can't believe it No I can't believe it.i said he was the same principle, I can't believe it i said then I can't  help you.If you are a fanatic I can't help you I can't it can not be cured.No whe went home and he had terrible times and his wife was wise enough she said now Islam has not helped you so far,you have been such a big muslim you have been doing Namaz and all that still your cancer can not be cured so why not listen to the mother if she says so give up so he came down to me and he said alright i agree that it was Nanak who came on this earth and all that and you will be amazed he is cured.He is cured of that trouble (not clear) .All these fundamentalist and fanatics you see we are aware of it now americans had a good look at them recently, very recently they had a nice shock from a man called Mr. Khomeini you know him too well but if you go and ask him he say Oh i am just from God I mean I am connected with God.And it is he who gave me these orders and it is through his orders  I worked out because they are so blind with the fanaticism that they don't want to see and this kind of fanaticism if it crawls into you you will also not see. for example even christian fundamentalist are the same or the hindu fundamentalist are the same i don't find anything anything different in them if you want to ask say a christian about a jew you will know about the jews but you will go to the jews and say christians are the worst of all and if you go to the muslims they will say the jews they are the worst they are curse to people,all of them think they are the best, the chosen ones and the rest  of them are going to be doomed.I must tell you that all fanatics are going to be doomed.One and all and I think in that domain of hell they may agree with each other but it may be too late for them to understand that god has not created has any fanatic.He has not.You are part and parcel of one being.Supposing this finger says I am alright(Shri Mataji pointing towards her index finger of left hand)or this finger says i am alright(Shri Mataji showing index finger of right hand), it is going to trouble the whole body it's such a nonsense that it is better to cut it out than to keep it there.Malignancy that works in us is the same that you are on own your own whats wrong i am on my own any cell that become like that is really malignant because it has no relationship with the whole it has no relationship with  the coordination and the co operation of the whole thing ,how it is working out, it is on its own whats wrong?The wrong is that you are getting out, out of circulation and very soon you will land up in a place which is called as Hell.And then you will ask Oh I never knew you are all connected with each other you are all part and parcel of one collective being which you have to just feel it and understand that you become that till this(Shri Mataji pointing to the wire of mic) is connected to the mains this does not work out out,once it is connected to the mains it works out.In the same way unless and until you are connected to the mains you can not know(or prove not clear) that you are a collective being.Before that this form big organisations we are all brothers and sisters and just after a month of that formation of an organization you find that people are cutting each other's throats.Why? Because they are not really brothers and sisters they have not felt.When you become then you just can't help it.Like people may say that mother you help so many people, you do so much for them why do you cure them i said whom do i cure who is the other.If this finger is paining I have to rub it off and get it alright ,is the part and parcel of me.if there is not the other then you just help the other person because he is part and parcel of you.If somebody is getting drowned and you are trying to save that person, you are doing it because something in you is right,you are not doing it because you are trying to help the person,because there is something in you is dying and you want to save that person,this is what it is and this collectivity you can only feel if you are first of all in balance.The people who go off their balances are very difficult to get their realization This is one side of the movement in dharma also when they seek god,when they seek their realization they go to the other side of it.Now people can't believe that for this you can not put in any effort.No action is needed.now look at the trees.Look at the flowers,how spontaneously they become fruits.Look at the trees how they turn themselves in the leaves towards the sun and how they get their chlorophyll is established in them,how it happens so spontaneously.how it works out how they understand while we think that by doing some sort of an effort we are going to become something higher is a absolutely an absurd idea as it is you did nothing to become human beings,you did nothing whatsoever,you became human being effortlessly and further if you have to go it has to be effortless everything vital is always effortless as i said the other day if you have to breathe and for that breathing if you have to go to libraries and go to some guru and pay him  some money how many will survive it is so vital that it has to happen the only difference in this evolution and the evolutions so far we have had is this that this you being free,you are going to feel it in your awareness before this you never felt it in your awareness Now only at this time you are going to feel it in your awareness that you have become the other person that a cocoon has become the butterfly,that an egg has become a bird,you can feel it within yourself this happening you can absolutely monitor it within yourself and you are aware of it that this has happened to me.This is a blessing placed within you since long and that's why it is  Sahaja means born sahaja born with you. But today this Sahajayoga has become a Mahayoga, it has become a great yoga because one can work it out on enmass for many people can get realisation just like a blossom time many many flowers can become fruits in the same way many people can get realisation At this time when it is such an important time,this is the time of judgement that has started,now how will you judge yourself,how will god judge you is he going to put you on the on the say some sort of a weightlifting or to some sort of a one of the human tricks that we play to judge a person’s abilities no the kundalini is going to rise first of all,when the Kundalini rises you start getting that awareness on your fingers you start feeling the all pervading power on your fingers because these are the centers of your subtle being which get awakened you start feeling it, and by that feeling you get that vibratory awareness by which you get the discrimination and you know what's wrong with you and you know what's wrong with others.So you judge yourself you improve yourself you know the method how to improve yourself,you feel better and better and better and then once you are alright you judge yourself.There is no need for god to judge but god within you your own spirit judges you, because when the kundalini rises she touches the fontanel bone area where she pierces through you you can feel first sometimes the throbbing and then the cool breeze starts coming in there is the spirit ,the seat of the spirit though he resides in the heart of the human being the seat of the spirit is on top of your head and when it touches that you start getting this discrimination and you start understanding.Now if I tell you dont do this,that's why these ten commandments are that don't do this don't do that but human beings are such if you tell them don't do it they do it hundred times,there's something wrong with them i tell you the ,the brain is sometimes upside down i think if you tell them please don't do it don't burn your even to a child human child if you tell him now don't put your hand in the candle you will burn it still he will burn it he must learn,he is so ego oriented that he must learn by burning his hand,he must learn everything through experience of his ego till he is nicely bashed he won't listen.So the best thing I thought was to give the realization,once you have the realization once your car has started you will be know where is the problem,because if you tell somebody this is the problem he may hit you back it's not easy if you tell somebody you have too much of ego he will come and box you completely,you can be crucified, i mean this is what has happened to christ it is not easy to deal with human beings you see they are so much just like a big snake sitting down there you tell them something and it just comes on you because if you mesmerize them if you pamper their ego Oh you are great people only pass on your money to me and you will be yogis you will be siddhas so you dont mind its alright very simple no,you give some money to mataji Nirmala Devi,alright she has all the money doesn't  matter we have the siddhas we are the siddhas we are the great yogis this is my name is fallana(Hindi word) anand,thikana(Hindi word) anand and dhonga(Hindi word meaning Fake) anand and all these things all these names you will wear then the clothes you will wear and walk with a great pride Oh we are the yogis we are the great yogis absolutely stupid,you are not you are not but you behaving it because there is nothing involved so you don't have to grow nothing very simple it is not so you are seekers you are seekers and you will be seekers till you have found it.Its better that you find it and accept it, because i said don't do it don't go there you are doing it alright so the mothers style is different alright awaken their Kundalini,first of all awaken their Kundalini ,like we had one doctor rustom veera(not clear) and he is a very good doctor and all that and he got his realization, he got his realization after that i told him that now you don't drink and he really forgot about drinking completely  i mean i never told him before you drink alright come along doesn't matter whatever you do come along he said mother i never felt like drinking but once after sometime he went to Germany and he used to like some sort of a wine as he told me and he said that now let us see what happens you see just like that because he was very fond of it so he went to drink that and he had a terrible pain in the stomach and he vomited out and the whole thing was smelling like a rotten cork and he said as if like cork was coming out of my mouth i felt so horrible and after that i said had it and his health improved his money improved because he was not wasting any more money on these nonsensical things he had nice musical gadgets in his house and he started improving his life in every way he started looking so beautiful and so nice.Now the thing is if i tell you don't drink i tell you all the pub people will come and hit me hard but i don't say that it just works out because once you have found out the nectar the beauty of yourself do not do it you drink because you are bored you smoke because you are bored of yourself,you just get bored i mean if you are imprisoned why should you be so unhappy you are just facing yourself i mean it's the best thing that can happen to the person is to be imprisoned because you are just watching yourself and self is the most beautiful thing but people are unhappy because they can not face themselves they want to run away five minutes also people won't sit down together and talk to each other,they must call you for a cocktail or there should be a television going on or there should be some book two people must be reading,they can not talk for five minutes no rapport.But after realization you feel so relaxed and so happy with yourself  you enjoy yourself so much that you forget about these things now we have people here some of them have been druggists and chemist completely alcoholics and all sorts of things and just it has worked out so well that they have become now people who are so beautiful.They have got this nectar of this spirit and they are giving it.The imbalances on the left hand side on the religious side because yesterday i told you about physical side and all that but today an emotional side but i am telling you today about the religious side what we do that we believe in going to spirits of all the spirits and the plankchits and this and that we go to the whats the store that in Los Angeles you have got witchkraft you have all types of nonsensical things going on and for what do you do it they said that you see my father died and i loved him very much and wanted to meet him now let him die poor thing has died now spared of you let him have his freedom why are you torturing his soul Oh i wanted to talk to him and then what you get is asthma as a result of that your father suffers because he must die now he has to be in another world and you have to face it because now you are living you are in the present.Why do you want to call people who have now gone and finished but once you start doing all these things then mesmerism starts ESP starts all this nonsense starts and you become slaves to this and these things can be so dangerous I mean english language is such a funny language that you have got for spirit even if you have to say the alcohol is spirit even the spirit that is dead is a spirit and your spirit that is in your heart which is the ‘atma’ is also spirit and the Holy ghost is also a spirit.So I don't know which spirit you are worshipping, I am talking of the spirit that is the ‘Atma’,the spirit within your heart.And we go to all kind of these spirits morning till evening going to our some left side(some word not clear).Now you will be amazed the result of this physically is physically leave alone other things multiple sclerosis is one of them recently i cured a patient of multiple sclerosis.He has been to one of the gurus who is very popular in this country,he has got multiple sclerosis now. Another thing that you get is blood cancer thirdly most of the cancers come from that side and all these things can happen to you if you indulge into the left side.Now it has been proved by doctors also that there are some sort of proteins which attack us from the area which is unknown which is built within us since our creations means our left side the collective conscious side.It has been accepted but of course they call it unknown because they are not seers they are not the people who have reached that stage to see that the spirits are coming from the left side i mean i actually see them coming to a person and attacking them and getting out of them they are there within usand anytime they can erupt and trigger anything like cancer on the physical level i am telling you then you can develop epilepsy you can develop schizophrenia you can develop all kinds of these mental problems lunacy all these problems comes to you from the left side.from the right side movement you can become extremely arrogant you can become absolutely useless for any talking or discussion or anything you lack all the sense of proportion and you can become even hitler.Hitler is one of the symbols of this development of the right side, so those who push you into your egos and pamper you too much be careful be very careful because they are pushing you into the right in your dharma also in your ascent in your seeking and the ones which are giving you on the left hand side are also doing the sameNow the simple thing is the people who are money minded themselves have a problem always money minded people are really like stuck up i don't know what to call them they are absolutely stuck up people because money mindedness comes to us because we value money than anything else money is not the source of joy by any chance even those who have lots of money if you go and see them they are the most most miserable people.On the contrary a man who is not  has got so much money who has no problems he is happy.For example supposing i own this machine take a simple example of possession of this machine now what happens to me i am worried about it about cleansing it about its insurance i don't know what are the income tax all these things come with it.if i don't own it it is own by say Mr.Hugo is the headache gone to possess something means a headache to possess money today only i wanted to have some money cashed it was such an experience of such a developed country like yours and los angeles i was amazed we couldn't get money anywhere they said that we our money is i just not much it was only two how much 2000 dollars only two thousand dollars i had to pay cash money to people and all that i couldn't get the money cashed because they said we don't have so much money you go to the main bank we went to the main bank i actually as if they went to the mint from 9:30 till about one o’clock we couldn't get the money can you imagine they made me sign this sign that sign this i said what's happening,you people are supposed to be affluent people there is no trust there is everybody standing with a pistol somewhere or what's happening i don't understand when you have so much money how could you have so much but in India no problem no problem i was in india in a place called Nilambar these people were there foreign(or warren not clear) and all this so i told him i am not going you take my passport and give them this thing that i have signed it not only that they sent money they heard i was here they came from the bank to take my darshan and to get their realization you see people trust in poor countries they just trust here you come you have to have Visa this thing,in India if you come nobody will be bothered i mean you have to trust if which is means mistrust.In london people wont open their houses even a rat does not enter their house I tell you they will morning till evening the husband poor things the wives do not but the husbands poor things are cleaning i seen them cleaning all the knobs everything cleaning the garden all the things and not even a rat enters their house u see they open this much chini kind of know and i have not seen anybody enter their house only the husband and wife come all frightened looking at each other holding their purses like this is more surprising you are people belonging to free country when such how from where did you get these people around i mean in India there's no question we walk with all our ornaments everything nobody does that to us and one lady was killed in a one lady when she was wearing lots of ornaments and all that early in the morning she was going by a train all alone in a first class she was going for a wedding and some man killed her and took all the ornaments i mean it was too much of a temptation.And the place was that and time was like that(not clear).Oh god there was the whole of the university went into you will surprised into strike for that the such a (word not clear).I said in London every third day there is a mugging going on this is going on this is nothing in London is so common and now i have told that here you can't get money even in the bank can imagine i have to go for three hours just to get ordinary two thousand dollars can u believe it and is that the sign of freedom, is that the sign of affluence what is happening is that people are insecured they are insecured completely because of this money mounting they live with their money,if there is no money what is the matter doesn't matter doesn't matter it is not so important but the way people are after money all the time counting every pie and all that they loose this chance there Vishuddhi is go out but worst of all their nabhi nabhi chakra goes out you get a left Nabhi problem such people may get also blood cancers they may get troubles of the left Nabhi and such people have such a terrific speediness and such what you called a franticness they are very frantic people you see if they see money somewhere they go absolutely mad as if money is like a some sort of a spirit or ghost they have seen any talk of money they just jump onto it its too much i just can't understand such personalities they  are not most abnormal absurd people how are they human being if money can rule you then you are slaves of money you talk of independence and freedom where is your freedom the money is ruling you here that's what happens in your seeking when you come to a person those who are money minded people if they come to a person he said alright you can pay money to me and you can purchase god you feel very happy ah very good idea we can purchase god also.Can you purchase god can you purchase him and that's how these people take advantage of that ego you think we have money we can purchase god now we are people very rich people we can purchase god.God is that's why he is christ has said that a rich man can not enter into the kingdom of god even a camel can pass through the hole of a needle, but a rich man can not enter into the kingdom of god because he is stuck out (not clear)he is just become like you see you make somebody a you say that you hole him(not clear) in the same way the person is completely entrust with this money thing now when they start that this is all junk and this is all non sense we should get out of it so what do you do you said alright give up these things let us start another counter culture let us start another stuff but you are not out of it just it is a make belief you are not out of it you think that you have done it you have not done it how will you get out of it is only through your awakening of this center where there is a deity who is the father who is the preserver who is the preserver aspect of god who exist in that area unless and until you believe that there is a preserver who looks after us the god almighty looks after us you are not going to get out of it.After realization supposing you are a poor person if you have problems of money you will be surprised your material side will improve your material life improves it improves so much but how krishna has said yogakshemam vahamyaham when you get the yoga you get the well being when you get union with god that this is the center of lakshmi the center of  the goddess of wealth of well being if she is awakened in you you get your money but the money is not the way Mr. Ford has got no not that money is the lakshmi,lakshmi is a very beautiful symbol of a balanced money in man in his one hand in her one hand first of all she is a lady she is a lady standing on a lotus can you imagine how light hearted she is how light she must be here if a rich man walks you see he must have a special honking thing if he sits here he must show that he is a very rich man he walks with a big gait and show that he must have a big car to show off that he is a very big man but here she just stands on a lotus she is so simple and she has in one hand on she has four hands on two hands she has got the lotus.Lotus means she has warmth she has love the pink colour and inside the lotus is such a soft corona you can say the soft bed and the bed is used by a very thorny insect whom we call as a i dont know you call it  a bee or something  its a very thorny or nat(not clear) i think is a black thing is used for sleeping so the person who has money has to be warm like a lotus and anybody who comes to his house he must be welcome the way the lotus welcomes and puts him on this beautiful soft couch even a person like a nat if he comes she must offer this is a sign here if the guests comes in had it i mean the guests as soon as he sees the face of a person when he enters he just runs away he can't bear because to them it means expense any guest coming in is a expense but the amount of joy one can get in giving something to another is not there so generosity is the only way to overcome your greed for money if you earn money better give it if you earn two give three if you buy something buy it for giving if you start doing like that you will get over this money mindedness which is such a  mire into which so many people have embedded actually poor are better if you go to poor man’s house he will offer you lot of milk he will be happy you have come to that house whatever things he has he will offer you but if you go to a rich man’s house he will be really frightened that one guest has come in his house when he can afford to look after thousands he cannot bear it so generosity is the only solution for people who are money minded on the contrary your generosity will flow to people who do not deserve it like these horrible gurus you see they have got keeps you see they have got big big cars you see they have big built big mansions they are parasites and you are going flowing money on to them because there's your ego there is a competition we have cults in India where they have competitions they take out the gods photograph outside alright the one who is going to give 500 pounds say example sits on the horse sits on the horse the one who gives 1000 pounds will sit on the elephant like that you see they go on with the god and that's how they gone (word not clear) and in that community i have seen they also auction it now the one on the horse how much how much how much 500 than (some sound) its like that they are selling god and they are they are doing it and it's a very regular thing you have to go and we call it calling calling for that how much money you are going to pay is this the way to receive god and to understand him this is alright for money minded people they will go into the mire of money and finished there now god is love he is not money he doesn't understand money you see doesn't understand really and godly people dont  i am hopeless and i am absolutely hopeless i don't understand this i don't know how to sign a cheque i don't know anything i only know kundalini so if you ask me about the money part i am so hopelessly bad that i mean you will be amazed i am just like a rustic person who has never known a b c’s of anything as far as money is concerned because i don't understand why to worry about so much what is the such a need to count it everytime to measure everytime to find out every time there is no need with all that such a headache such a worry such a problem use whatever you get you just live with it why to worry about all this small small things and to go about wasting your life for this nonsensical thing like material things this we can create at the just if you hit it in them it will all be created human beings have already created what is so great about them now you have to take to the living course the living power within you by which you create living work now after realization you will be amazed if you give vibrations to the wheat or to any such things to flowers you get such big flowers you get a new we have tried this in a agricultural university and they have found out when you give vibrations to the wheat they have found it can increase five times in its growth they have seen a cow an Indian cow if she is given vibrated water to drink she can give quite a lot of milk not so much as we can say an australian cow but australian cows milk is not good is not a good thing is very too much on the right hand side but she will give so much is much more than what she normally gives so you do not become too much you will become a laxmipati means you get so much money that you can receive people you can invite them you are cosy and you live in a house which is beautiful now she has another hand which is just giving if you earn you must give otherwise the whole thing stagnates I have known people who have gathered newspapers since 50 years they have got tubes of that toothpaste gathered since they have been born all sorts of things we gather here thinking that you see all kinds of mad people who go on collecting things and you have to actually get  the municipal people to take it away after paying them big money to clear out this nonsense of the garbage these people have created in the house so this is how you should allow things to flow from your house,let it go give it give it and give it when you give then new things come in i mean only i have been giving only in my lifetime you will be amazed i go on giving and giving and giving but still my house and my everything is so filled i don't know what to do every time i get a chance i give everytime i find a chance i give so that i do not hurt anybody so i give them but i find the whole house is filling up you give somebody one flower they’ll send 10 flower what to do i can't understand they the people who preserve you see decays and they become so old sitting down counting everything while i have seen this is the most healthy way of living in this world just give just give do not worry anybody ask anything likes to order have it .its such a good thing such a great thing such a joy suddenly you meet somebody today i meet a lady in a party she said do you remember you gave me this i said which one she said this this the one i am wearing a pearl i had come to your house when i was married you gave me this pearl i said really i don't remember oh i wear wore it today just to show you how i mean i felt so happy just what a little thing like pearl necklace i had given a but what a thing to remember all her life she met me after 20 years that time she was pregnant and today she had a son i was so amazed to see this beautiful thing happening just she wore it all the time she had it with the and she wore it the day she was to meet me she knew i was coming to the party what a great feeling i mean you can not purchase it with thousands of these pearl necklaces can be thrown on this little little beautiful event in my life that i felt this lady how she had cared for a little thing like that.all these things are for for expressing your love and these are for expressing your love and if you understand the value of love you can get rid of it now the other hand of the goddess is like this(Shri Mataji showing her right hand palm) this means a person who has money must give ‘ashraya’ ashraya means he must give a protection to people.he must have some people who are in their protection like in India people say that you have a servant system this thing that thing but of course i mean i i do not say that in India servants are treated i mean my servant has a better bedroom than i have i must tell you he has a better bedroom than i have because my husband has one bedroom and naturally i have a small one because I share his bedroom and he has a bigger one and his lives better than me in many ways but he is a person who can do all this work now i have to do kundalini work if i start sweeping swaoping in the house if my husband has to sweep swop whose going to look after his office here the thing is even the president must go on and sweep and swop otherwise he is not alright i don't understand see if you have people who are dependent upon you i mean your children should work for you in the same way there are servants if they work for you what is wrong in England i have seen old people die there is nobody to look after them one month  they are lying in the rooms there's no body to pick their bodies because they can not have somebody to help you and the young people are sitting outside and taking ganjas i mean it is shameful thing it is there are old children might be taking ganja somewhere and their father is dying there why can't these people go and work and help their parents and look after them if they are old they are suppose to clean sweep swop even the eighty year old people must drive their cars they must take them to the thing is not good you are not just to them so you must have people in ashraya if you have money you should have people who should do some work for you for example now everybody wants to do every work by themselves for example now we can say our stitching of a say a blouse now we have a tailor we have had him for about 20-30 years since my daughters were married he is tailoring my blouses alright now he poor man how much does he take at the most say about 2 dollars or 1 dollar for this thing let him have it he can only do that much work let him do that work he is a expert in it now i have no time to do my so you will say now why should you waste your time on that why should you waste your money on that but i cant stitch the way he does it let him do it whats wrong here we have killed all our art all our a all our aesthetics by doing everything yourself you can not do everything yourself now paper if you have to apply paper you must do yourself why don't you share your money with somebody else why do you want to do everything yourself same thing has happened to our cooking i mean people eat nothing but fodder here sometimes the way they cut everything just eat all that its an an good excuse to say that we are eating all the vitamins but thats too hard for human digestion its not good you never cook in the house because the wife must work the husband must work they must all go to the office they all should work the wife has no time the husband has no time no time for the children. The wife has to cook in the house if she has spare time alright she should work also she has to look after the children there is nothing wrong in that work that's a very noble work the idea i sometimes say those people who have done good work in their previous lives are the mothers today they are having a nice time i mean i look at my husband i say how much he work hard i mean now as a mother i do work for my sahaja yoga but otherwise i have a comfortable life so why must you all do all the work you must have some people for your ashraya you must give them some money share your money with others protect them this is one of the things that we have to understand about this deity which is called as a lakshmi and she resides in our stomach and this is very important to understand that if you want to have  blessings of the divine you should be a balanced person you have to raise awaken the lakshmi principle within you and that lakshmi resides in this kind of balancing where you understand that love is the determining factor of all our monetary behaviour,monetary exchanges and report there is no other way we can judge it and that's the main basic thing which we are missing today in the modern times now the kundalini is awakening takes place and awakens this centre when this is awakened then you go higher into the center which is higher we can say called as the center of the heart but between these two  is a center that is moving round and round is a center of our activity which is the center of swadhisthana i had told you about this yesterday that how by activating the swadhisthana chakra too much we develop imbalances with in us we develop disease like diabetes we develop diseases like kidney and spleen and also uterus trouble in women because there are imbalances after this center which is in the which is the center of our activity  when we have gone beyond this center then we go to this center which is called is the center of heart this is very important center in human being is governed by the deity of jagdamba meaning the mother of the the universe  this center is acting on our sternum in our childhood we develop our antibodies in our sternum when this the center starts acting and these antibodies later on spread in the whole body and start defending us against all kinds of diseases against all kinds of attacks on us and theses doctors know about it they know  there are antibodies but they can not say how they are created and how they are within us when we are attacked from outside by anything what happens you start getting the palpitation because these people are informed through the sternum bone that the attack is coming and this palpitation suggest that there is an emergency and antibodies must fight it now the women who are insecured  like that they develop a disease called a what you call breast cancer and all those things and these diseases can be very dangerous  in people who have insecurities and who hide themselves and who do not tell about insecurities they can develop this diseases and ultimately they can be in terrible trouble today i am sorry i won't be able to cover all the centers  because its already quite late and we have this hall only till 10:30 so we have to do the actualisation of the experience  of getting the realization and we have to work it out so that is the main thing and what ever was possible i have told you the theory behind the awakening of the kundalini upto these centers and if possible tomorrow i will try to do the other two centers now should we have the experience can i have some water.I think it would be better if everyone moves forward will be better for us to work it out.Thank you(Shri Mataji taking the glass of water).You just put your both the hands towards me better thing would be to take out all your shoes because the mother earth have sense to take the problem on to its side(not clear)next line not clear. Now i have to request you that you  might get your realization today but the kundalini is just made out of many threads  and one of the threads comes up to open your sahastrara in this point (Shri Mataji pointing towards fontanel bone area) and then this is raised(word not clear) now    but that's not the end of it you have to make more space for greater threads to go in to establish yourself in sahaja yoga now to do that you have to come to a center where this collective happening can takes place of course tomorrow we are going to have this program here(not clear) but after that i am going away and he has agreed to stay here and it is going to work it out from (not clear)they want to establish some sort of a center here in Los angeles where you people can go every week say in a weekend or something and develop your powers your own powers and master it and master it out so that you start giving realization to others you all can do it the beginning is rather difficult in the beginning what happens is that like anything any light which you enlightened in the beginning is rather difficult you have to look after any seed that has sprouted the seedling is the sensitive gentle thing you have to look after it but then when it grows it become like a tree and you can give realisation to many.Now we have been here as he himself has been with me only for 18 months and imagine how many people he has given realisation to you can't count it in australia each person who is here who is in your (not clear) there is no need to get any sanction or anything you can start off its very simple as long as you you are settled down you can start out in your own house isn't it anywhere(not clear) has started off an sahaja yoga centre so one has to first of all grow and settle into so it's not that today you are going to get it in the last moment you may loose it tomorrow for time being but once it is established you will never loose it it is always there always there now can i have your hands just like this straight towards me like this straight and close your eyes please close your eyes just close your eyes you have to keep your eyes shut because the kundalini can not cross the mount(not clear) of agnya chakra if your eyes are not closed so keep it closed...(slowly hamsa is there) …..you are not to feel guilty what ever i have said is there just for your information but i must give you the latest information that everything whatever you have done will be forgiven has to be so you just don't think i am guilty or isn’t(not clear) a guilty now please say
