Morning Conversation with Joseph, Jewels And Chakras

Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He says, Mother, that when he was in the meeting yesterday he was listening to You and tried to touch You. And suddenly he felt this, when You went past him … he didn’t get any smell from You and when You went past him he felt the sandalwood, very strong sandalwood smell.
Shri Mataji: Sandalwood?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: He says You must have very beautiful vibrations.
Shri Mataji: Sandalwood and all this fragrance comes from within. Even if you remember Me sometimes, you’ll get fragrance. This Mother Earth is made out of fragrance.
What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogini: He is telling a story about a friend of his – Fernando. He was a man, a very, a very advanced man for his age to reach. He talked very much with him. He’s telling a story of a friend of his now.
Shri Mataji: He’s getting fragrance?
Sahaja Yogini: It was two of his friends who were talking about him, and suddenly when they were talking about him after he died, they felt and smelled the fragrance, sandalwood fragrance.
Shri Mataji: He might be a realized soul.
Shri Mataji: In India only the realized souls are buried and not other people. Everybody is burnt up. Only the realized souls are buried.
[Seeker says something]
Shri Mataji: He’s a quality, is he? See the quality? Bring your friend also. But I think you have are a very good quality.
I’ll give you the book. And you can get it translated from them. He’s going to stay here. I’ll write your name.
Sahaja Yogi : Pete Kondra is a diminutive name. Joseph Kondra. [Long conversation in Spanish]
Shri Mataji: Note his address also. Is he married or not? What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogini: He is a lawyer and he is married now. It is a civil wedding….
Shri Mataji: How is she?
Sahaja Yogini: She is a little bit of a saint and a little bit of a witch.
Shri Mataji: [Big laugh] …“Meeta” in Sanskrit means “little” (half)
Sahaja Yogi: Marriage is like a contract to him.
Shri Mataji: Now, just now. But after you bring her along, we’ll give her Realization. Then it’s a divine contract.
Sahaja Yogini: He says he has to be careful what he’s doing.
Shri Mataji: I tell you why it is important now, because many great souls want to be born again and they want good parents. And that’s why marriage has to be good, sensible and peaceful and stable.
Sahaja yogi: He says he is happy.
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He’s a lawyer, Mother. And his speciality is divorce.
Shri Mataji: What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Divorce.
Sahaja Yogini: A lawyer of divorce.
Shri Mataji: Is he?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: All right. Let him ask the question, “Mother, are You the source of all the laws?”
Again.
Again.
Again.
All right, you get it? Now, you have to ask ten times.
 
Shri Mataji: Where are you catching? Here?
This is the one what you have done, all this treating and all that of Krishnamurti and all that. He’s unauthorized. They have no authority to talk of God. This one, Swadisthana, left. Unauthorized, they are unauthorized. In the law of God, in the law of God, they are unauthorized people.
Sahaja Yogi : He says that all the ones that talk about love have the authority.
Shri Mataji: No, no, they just talk.
Sahaja Yogini: No he didn’t say that.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. What did he say?
Sahaja Yogini: He said that You are speaking like that because You have the authority.
Shri Mataji: Aaha, But yes, but you see them, unless and until they are Realized souls they are not - just like you are a lawyer, you can practice. They are not lawyers of love so they cannot practice love.
So that is why this is catching [left Swadisthan]. But it will go away. See?
Sakshat Shri Gurubhyam, Sakshat Shri Gurubhyam, Sakshat Shri Gurubhyam, Sakshat Shri Gurubhyam, Sakshat Shri Gurubhyam. Aha, now all right?
It’s less. Still tension is there.
What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogini: he feels much better.
Shri Mataji: You give him a sort of a light. This is the only problem you have. Otherwise everything is - better.
Sahaja Yogini: He’s saying he’s feeling cool breeze now.
Shri Mataji: Ah. I’m heating them out. Now better.
Sahaja Yogini: He is noticing it.[Sahaja Yogis explain what is happening because of the light]
Shri Mataji : Everything is practical in Sahaja Yoga. Everything that we say, we can see in the Kundalini. Say for example the Kundalini stops here, you have to take the name of Jesus Christ. If it stops here then you have to say : “Mother I believe in You.” Is all practical, is living. And a rapport is established with the – now, living rapport.
Shri Mataji: What he is saying?
Sahaja Yogini: That’s logical. Where the Kundalini stops we have to invoke the deity that is there.
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s what it is.
Sahaja Yogini: He said it’s very simple and it takes ages to learn this, Mother. He says, “I’m like a donkey.”
Shri Mataji: No, no. It will take no time because you learn it in no [time] little, little children know. Very, very simple.
Ha, there.
It’s better now, it’s cooler.
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, he said : “Of course, because he’s next to You, with Sahaja Yogis with good vibrations. And he says, if he’s next to You, he feels much better.
Shri Mataji: There are. I’m always with you. I don’t leave My children alone. Wherever you are, I’m with you.
Good.
He should come to London. Guru Puja, why not call him on a Guru Puja day? Great idea. When is Guru puja day? 6 of July or 5th… Will be good. We’ll be getting all the Sahaja yogis there. Give him the address of the London ashram also, so that he can – you take his address…
Guru puja is on the 6.
Sahaja Yogini : 6 of ?
Shri Mataji : 6 of July. But it will be held on the 5th I think. Come on the 4. Third is better on because third is a Friday. No third is a Saturday, 4th is a Sunday and Monday is the fith so he can stay there for few days. We have ashram, it will not make problems. He can come on the third if he wants. Third, third of July.
Sahaja Yogini : Yes Mother, he is coming.
Shri Mataji : Tell him perfect. Perfect knowledge! In three four day, I don’t know who else know Portuguese.
Sahaja Yogini : Spanish.
Shri Mataji : Spanish. Who else?
Sahaja Yogini : In London?
Shri Mataji : Hem [yes]
Sahaja Yogini : Dom .. Luis, Rodriguez
Shri Mataji : Yes, you are all there. And Dom?
Sahaja Yogini : No...
Shri Mataji : So that he can talk to him.
[Big laugh] What did he say?
Sahaja Yogini : She was saying that if he has no money we can help him. But he is a lawyer, so he has money.
Shri Mataji : She has married an English man. And he is also writing a book, on Sahaja Yoga. They are all married here. They all have married Sahaja yogis.
What did he say?
Sahaja Yogini : He says there are perfect Sahaja Yoginis.
Shri Mataji : No, they are much more perfect now, after Realization. They enjoy life. Get your wife Realized, get her.
They are all very happy…He can come this evening?
Sahaja Yogini : He is just thinking of bringing his friend tonight and his wife tomorrow…
Bring also wife also, friend also.
Sahaja Yogini : He says that he can bring his wife tomorrow morning.
Shri Mataji : All right, 9 o’clock then we see how we can go.  9 o’clock, because at 10 o’clock we go away so he comes at 9.
Sahaja Yogini : Mother he says that he has a car, if you want to go anywhere, he can bring you anywhere you like.
Shri Mataji : Thank you very much.
Sahaja Yogini : Do you want this afternoon?
Shri Mataji : [laughing] What about him?
Sahaja Yogini : He will drive you Mother.
Shri Mataji : He will drive for us? What we can do, we have 2 cars if he comes, some of you can go in the same car and they can also go. And we can go to the embassy. Will be a good idea. We’ll see the ambassador also, Indian ambassador, a very good man. He’s a Realized soul. And then after the meeting, you see, before we just come up for here with the program, and his wife will come later. So we have two cars. We have one car. If he comes also with us, then we can take her with us to the embassy. Embassy, one program is there. And after the embassy, we can take him down to this program. All of us will be there but you people come along faster about one hour earlier. I’ll come later on. I leave about seven thirty. You leave about six thirty because it is from five thirty the program. So we have to leave at five o’clock. Now, and as we know the road is very easy to reach there. Five o’ clock we have to leave. So you tell him? What’s the program named?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes
Shri Mataji : I’ll go with you, with some other people.
Sahaja Yogini: What time we go Mother?
Shri Mataji : We have to leave – how much s the embassy’s time from here? Now we have to go when?
Sahaja Yogini: At five o’clock from here Mother.
Shri Mataji : At five o’clock from here. And she will tell exactly how to go because now – yesterday, we made a mistake, you see, So there’s a very simple road, you’ll tell him you how to go.
Sahaja Yogini: He is coming quarter to five here.
Shri Mataji : that’s fine. Very nice. Then I’ll go with him.
Sahaja Yogini: He says you are wonderful. He says when he saw your picture in the street, he can because you are a woman, that’s why he came to see you.
Sahaja Yogi : He was walking on the street, Mother, and than he saw the poster. And he was really amazed because it was the first woman he saw that was teaching about the spiritual life.
It was extraordinary because you are a woman; In India women are supposed to stay in the house
Shri Mataji : Exactly. But only a woman can do this job now. Only a mother can have that patience, love, affection and that handling. Then, it’s a handling.
Yes. Job of a woman is needed now.
Sahaja Yogi: He said a man can get lost, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Very much, in his temper.
Sahaja Yogi: But a woman is more …
Shri Mataji: He has no patience, you see. Man has no patience and he can’t bear fruits – first of all.
What does he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He says a man always shoots up, Mother. He’s shooting up, he can get lost. But a woman is more family attached to.
Shri Mataji: She knows how to handle the situation because, you see, in this lifetime I’ve seen not only with stupid people you’ll be, very aggressive, very hot tempered, all kinds of people, you see. And if the man is there, he will beat them. He’ll just beat them. Like so many gurus, you know - real gurus also - they throw stones, they beat them, they are so hard actually, you can’t imagine.
They throw stones at people. They throw stones.
What did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He says that there’s a magic grace.
[Long talk from Joseph]
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He says that in the world people, humanity is going to be scratching and that the forces from the earth and from heaven are coming together to save, it’s not coming to an end.
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s another point, very correct. The tension is so much that the person who loves must just love and forgive and not to kill. You see, this is the thing, it’s too much of love and patience, tremendous patience.
A peaceful, a blissful person. This is the comforter. Is a comforter and a counselor because I’m now counseling. And also redeemer. Redeemer, the one who gives salvation.
Sahaja Yogi: He says around the power of earth and of heaven, are in You, Mother.
Shri Mataji: In the…?
Sahaja Yogi: In You.
Shri Mataji: That’s true. Just now one has to bring all the powers. Without that how can you solve this tremendous problem of emancipation of the whole masses of human beings? It’s not easy.
You see, to give Realization to one person was so difficult. Now we have to give to so many. Masses, thousands, thousands there. In India thousands are getting Realization. They have seen, they have been to India. They have seen, all these women have been to India. They have seen.
Sahaja Yogi: He says that in Spain it’s very difficult.
Shri Mataji: Very conditioned.
Sahaja Yogi: Because they [NOT CLEAR]
Shri Mataji: First of all they’re very conditioned by Catholicism. And secondly now by these modern ideas, you see, getting modern, nonsensical.
[Long talk from Joseph]
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: He says that to share the power, Mother, is very difficult. And You do it. You have the power and You share it.
Sahaja Yogini : He says that in Spain, in the time of the inquisition. It was a very hard time because spiritually, the people didn’t evolve or really expand and…
Shri Mataji: Spiritually people are?
Sahaja Yogini: They didn’t really evolve since that time. And also because, he said that, what you have, normally people just want the power for them or they don’t want to share it
Shri Mataji: That power is no power which cannot be shared.
Sahaja Yogi: He said that people don’t share the power first of all, because they don’t have it. [Laugh]
Shri Mataji: That’s the sign. That’s the sign.
What is he saying?
Sahaja Yogi: He’s talking about money, Mother. Money gives you a certain kind of power and nobody wants to share it.
Shri Mataji: Because it enslaves you, that’s why. You see, it is enslavement. It’s not freedom. If you have freedom, you share it.
Sahaja Yogi: He can see the environment, condition, heaviest condition by the environment. And he said if we were in India, we would be outside and we won’t be so conditioned by society.
Shri Mataji: It’s true; it is a blessing. India is a very blissful place.
What he means?
Sahaja Yogini: He said that a minimum of money is necessary because we have to live, we have to go by tube, we have to eat food. But he said this is just sufficient to live and afterwards we must not get taken up by the ambition and wanting having always more.
Shri Mataji: You see, actually money after Realization has its own value, because then you start spending for God’s love, you see. For example I traveled, I have to spend money, then that is so fulfilling because every travel means so many people get realization and it has a meaning. Otherwise what’s the use of traveling?
And even material possessions are for giving. It’s for giving others, you see, whatever you have to express your love you give. Like you give flowers, you give - I go on giving things like that. I enjoy giving.
Sahaja Yogini: He ahs another friend Mother who is coming tonight.
Shri Mataji : Today, at quarter to five.
Shri Mataji: So I’ll go and rest now. Will it be all right? Then I’ll have some peppermint.? You are very nice, you are really just there. I’m seeking people like you.
[Long talk from Joseph]
Sahaja Yogini: He said, Mother, he liked You because he can see You have the powers and because, he says, if You do not agree with him, if You said to him, “no” he says it’s all right because You are the person who has to perfect him.
Shri Mataji: But he has already reached right conclusions. Rationally he has reached right conclusions. Now spiritually he should verify them. That’s all. Tell him now.
Sahaja Yogini: He said that he apologizes for anything he has said or any attitude it was wrong.
Shri Mataji: Non, non, no.  I’m overjoyed, I’m overjoyed to meet him. You should say that “In one day how close we have become because you are the same style as we are.”
Sahaja Yogini: He’s trying that all his negativity goes out so he would be all right.
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. Don’t you worry. Absolutely.
Now in one day, imagine. Yesterday he came and how close one feels him.
Cause there is something so similar, isn’t it, within us, which is so much there. And just you meet and just you become one. It’s like that. It’s very simple.
He understood? He understood; he must be knowing English, after all.
46:42 Cut in the audio tape.
 
46:50
Shri Mataji: is used for Left Heart, little bit. Now this side. But it’s not a precious stone. Instead of that the Center Heart is ruby. See they have wrote down the whole thing.
Ruby. Heart. Center Heart.
And emerald for the Nabhi.
Sahaja Yogini: Sorry Mother?
Shri Mataji : Emerald.
Sahaja Yogini: For the Nabbhi Mother?
Shri Mataji : That is ruby.
What is it?
Sahaja Yogini: Copper and emerald.
Shri Mataji : Copper is also green, copper is fitting with [?]
For the Vishuddhi is this one. Vishuddhi is this one.
Sahaja Yogini: Saphiro, saphiro.
Shri Mataji: Blue, blue one.
And diamond, for this. These are ideas for a present. Tell him.
I give you some, for your stomach I’ll give you some emerald as a present.
Shri Mataji : What did he say?
Sahaja Yogini: He says that your are from Pluto so he will give you ‘granate”, garnet.
Shri Mataji : Garnet, garnet. ..Brought from Colombia.
He knows a lot about. Do you do any business in this? How do you know so much about this?
Sahaja Yogini: He says that what he really loves doing is magic rituals. But he promised to himself not to do them anymore. Those are not ritualized.
Shri Mataji: Good. Otherwise even if you bring them, I’ll make them unritualized. [Laugh]
Sahaja Yogini: Don’t you want to rest?
Shri Mataji: I want to, but I’m just finishing my tea, alright?
Sahaja Yogini: He understood that magic is very tricky. And if you commit a mistake, make a mistake, you’ll pay very much.
Shri Mataji: You will always pay. Whether you commit mistake or not, because it is a movement away from the reality. Always the - you see spirits come to help you, and you don’t know where they will land.
But the other magic is just playing with your hands is different. But this magic with the sprits is very dangerous. Like hypnosis, all these things are very dangerous.
Because you enter into an unknown area. And you don’t know how to protect yourself. Even psychologists get that problem.
Sahaja Yogini: He says besides that these forces will, these psychic forces will go to our ego and do not leave us in peace.
Shri Mataji: They will, they will come, they will enslave you. They can remove your body, just take it out your soul sometimes, and you can be lost, you can be dead. They do this to children so many times. It’s horrible thing, absolutely horrible. It has nothing to do with God.
Now I teach you the magic of God. It’s tremendous. Dynamic. Long pervading. That’s what you should have. Sink into that, one sinks into that.
55:30 Cut in the audio tape.
 
Shri Mataji: A machine for having breakfast. And he had to eat through a machine. So the machine used to had a hand by which it used to push food into your mouth, you see. You don’t have to use hand.. And there was one cake, and the cake was finished in the experimentation. So they put some bolts. And the machine started pushing the bolts in the stomach. But the worst was they put a … Chaplin makes such a fun of modern times, I tell you. It is [UNCLEAR, heart?]. So they said last one was they put a corn, you know, to eat and the corn used to turn and you have to eat, you see, and you are so fixed that your teeth were just on the corn, and you couldn’t eat it. But the corn started moving, revolving very fast and people were all scared. And the corn was just, you know, it was brushing the corn against his teeth, his lips and everything was [UNCLEAR] and the corn was very [INAUDIBLE]. It’s very interesting. Have you seen “Modern Times” of Charlie Chaplin? You get it seeing. It’s worth …the man is genius actually. He made such fun of these modern times. And that we see today. These computers … After some time we can’t use even fork and spoons, you see, you suddenly find something coming out [UNCLEAR] these computers sitting out here suddenly you’ll find the whole thing goes up and down. Everything is possible and the result with these computers, I tell you, they can be very wrong, I tell you.
The other day we went to buy these things, chandeliers, you see. And then when we went to buy the chandelier, what happened, the lady made something mistake on the machine, and she put opne hundred pounds extra. I had calculated in My mind.
I told her, “This is wrong. This is not correct.”
She said, “How do You say?”
I said, “I have a better machine in My head also. And this is wrong. Again you do it.” Again she did it. She got it correct.
She said, “It was my mistake. Instead of one, I pushed two.’
I said, “That’s it. So don’t do it by machine, do it by your brains. It’s much better. Otherwise I would have lost one hundred pounds.”
He spoke very well about Sahaja Yoga. You were not there when he spoke. He said that all these strange, crazy type of yoga are not the real yoga. Sahaja Yoga is the real yoga. It was revived by Me. It’s the real yoga of spirit and which is revived now by Mataji Nirmala Devi. That’s the [INAUDIBLE]. And She’s a very dedicated wife. Despite that She’s doing this great work and all that. But he said the remarkable thing is the way She’s mastered the technique. [INAUDIBLE] And the point of that [revival, you see, which was – they all come into My head?]. And they spoke for quite a long time. But they were very much interested, all of them. Some of them are foreign service people, you see. And these all foreign service people are the cream of the country.
Sometimes [UNCLEAR] start, the vibrations start coming very rhythmically.
Sahaja yogini: Yes
Shri Mataji: I actually [UNCLEAR]. Even when I’m tired if there’s some music, I enjoy. But I don’t like loud music, I don’t like, because it makes you too much [INAUDIBLE]. Today when you were playing this music there in the hall there was a man sitting next to Me. He was going on, on, on with the tune, he was enjoying it so much. We all were enjoying. Maybe these people will go and talk about it and tell them. You might get more people. This radio people did you telephone?
Sahaja yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What did she say? No time?
Sahaja yogi: Too many programs and…
Shri Mataji: But today she just have broadcasted.
Sahaja yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You never heard her. You should have heard. Specially you did such a good job.
All the time you are cooking. Very good taste you have got in your hand. This tastes very well. I’m sure you [INAUDIBLE] will come back because that girl comes with [clappings?]. [UNCLEAR] I think [you?] too has your quality of surrendering. And that’s how as you surrendered yourself to your husband, she is doing the same thing [INAUDIBLE], same mistake.
That principle of guru establishes within us our sustenance what we Sanskrit call dharma, our sustenance, our human quality. Actually you have to have a guru who is a realized soul, who loves you, who is absolutely master of Kundalini. And he does this work out of love for you, of compassion because he wants to share his joy with you. And such a person is extremely detached as far as your money, wealth, anything is concerned. He has no relationship with your money or position. You may be a king or anything, makes no difference to the guru. And we had at the time of Rama, His father-in-law was a guru, called Janaka. I mean He was the incarnation of this guru principle. We can say that the earliest was called as Adi Nath. Adi means primordial. Primordial master or Dattatreya. The principle is the innocence. Innocence aspect of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha. So guru has to be an innocent person and not a cunning man. Now we can say like Abraham, Moses all are incarnations of the same principle and Mohammed and Nanaka. All of them are incarnations of the same principle. Now when we accept such a person who is an incarnation, is perfectly all right. But they come once in a while after two thousand years on this earth. But if you accept a devil as your guru, then it creates a very bad problem within yourself.
There are two types of gurus, I mean false gurus. One puts you on the right side, one puts you on the left side. Now this Mahesh Yogi puts you on the left side. And there’s another fellow, Muktananda, puts you on the right side. Now see these two gentlemen [INAUDIBLE]. From their left it has risen and gone to the right. See this right side is here, you see, crossed over [UNCLEAR] and his has crossed over to the left. That’s how you can make out. All right?
Now we have got these ten principles in our stomach as I said. All right? And you are seekers. You are seekers of truth, and these are devils. So their first attention is to capture you and attack you. And the deeper you are, the worse it is. If you are a very great seeker then they will be after your life because there is a war going on between the evil and the good. And these are the methods they use by which they really try to ruin you completely healthwise, mentally and also not only that but spiritually. They create an imbalance, while the sustenance is your balance. They create an imbalance in you. And you are not aware. You are not aware as to how it has happened. They do it so cleverly.
Now in the sustenance or these ten sustenances are represented on our head here. So all the great saints, when they come on this earth, the incarnations, they tell never go touch the feet of anyone because they know that they are the only ones who should be worshipped. So they absolutely forbid you. Because once you start bow to someone, then that spoilt thing goes up into the head. And this is the most important center in a way because this is the center which is for the last incarnation of Christ. Is called as Ekadesha Rudra. So Christ Himself is bestowed upon with eleven destructive forces Himself. Destructive, so last coming will be His destruction. This is His place, Kalki. This is called in Sanskrit as murdha, is the plate, brain plate.
Now this is what happens that we do not notice this and we go on doing it because we think something is wrong with us all the time. Then we don’t achieve anything, you see. We start doubting ourselves, and not the guru. And we think something is wrong with us. And we just do not know how to find out whether we are doing right or wrong, whether this guru is right or wrong, there is no way to find out. One gentleman came from America, from this Muktananda, who was with him for sixteen years. And he’s now become like a cabbage. Luckily he met a girl whom he wanted to marry, an Indian girl. He was an Australian. But she said, “You are a possessed person. You are a cabbage. How can I marry you?” Then it came into his head that “In sixteen years what have I achieved? I’ve lost my money, everything. I’m in trouble.” Otherwise he was not aware. Sixteen years, can you imagine? So he came to London. See how Sahaja Yoga acts. He prayed that “Oh God, I’m a seeker, if I’m a true seeker, take me to a real person.” He came to London and he was going to India, and he went to the agency of Dinesh who is a Sahaja yogi. Now this Dinesh is the son-in-law of the Commander in Chief of India of the army. Do you believe? Now his father was a very big man too and very big officer, and his father and mother had gone to Anandmayi and he was absolutely fed up with Anandmayi because both had become zero. He lost his job, everything happened in the family, terrible things, finished. So he told him, “Why do you want to go to Anandmayi? At least don’t go there, you are already finished. You go and see Mother.”
So he said, “How can I see Her now. I’m just flying out in the evening time and how will I see Her now?”
He just walked into My house. He said, “Mother I’ve come now. This is my condition. Will You please help me? I’ve lost all my properties, money, everything to this man and then I discovered how much damage he had done to me.”
I raised his Kundalini, everything, and he has now gone to Australia to our center. In Australia our center is powerful. Thank God he’s saved. In the previous lives, he was called as Bandasur, this Muktananda, was killed by the Goddess. And this fellow was called as Narakasur, so he was killed by the Goddess.
So you have to say the mantra that “You are the killer of Bandasura, You are the killer of Narakasura.” If you say this mantra you can get cured. They have different names. Like this Guru Maharaji was Raktabij. His name was Raktabij. He was horrible. He’s the 666 which Christ has described, which is described by John. He’s the one, born on the sixth of June. This one is Guru Maharaji. And the Mahishasura is that one with the fuzzy hair, what you call this Satya Sai Baba. They are all asuras, one better than the other. Why I’m telling you this, because when I cure you, you have to know that the diseases because of these gurus, whatever trouble is, and the mantra must be explained. It is not just I take money from you and give you a mantra. It is not possible, you see? Did you follow My point? You have to know why this mantra is said, because you must know what is the problem and what is the cure. You follow My point? Because it is very confusing. If I tell you any mantra, you will say that “Why this mantra Mother?” because now you are free. You will ask Me question. Nobody ask them question but you will ask Me definitely. Because with him nobody asks why.
Sahaja yogi: Is that mantra [INAUDIBLE]?
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course, [Abhishikt?], because the thing is this mantra is now told by a realized soul. Unless and until the mantra is told by the realized soul, it is not a mantra which is enlightened mantra. But only for people who are suffering like this a particular mantra is given for the very beginning. But later on they become just like other Sahaja yogis, cleared out, and then they have to know the different mantras of the different things.
Now for any other center where I live for a longer time, I don’t say all these things in the second day or third day because it is too early to say. The satya is too harsh to understand, this truth. Because if you are half-baked you may fizzle out, you see. You make not take it properly. But as this time we have no time, I have to tell you all about it in a short time. But you take it with a proper sense. Because I have nothing to gain from you. I have come here to give you something. All right?
Now, can you write it for him, Narakasura’s mantra?
1:28:43
Now come along; just sit down, put it from of it, facing it, just put your- this side.
Now for all you people who are left sided best is the fire. Fire burns the gurus completely. All their hubris [?] are burnt away by fire.
