Debu Chaudhuri plays raag Kambhoji on sitar, in the presence of Shri Mataji in a public program in Delhi, Feb 8th 1983, (part 2)
Followed by a Hindi talk given by Shri Mataji.

The sitar represents the Sahasrara chakra.

Sahaja Yogis want to give a cushion to Shri Mataji but She refuses.
Then they want to garland Her and She asks them instead to garland the artist.
Everybody applauds.
But Debu Chaudhuri refuses to be garlanded in place of Shri Mataji so he puts the garland around the head of his student (who is playing tempura). Everybody laughs.
A senior Sahaja Yogi makes a small speech: My dear brothers and sisters, music is the nearest thing to God on earth. Mataji has often said the way to please God and His devotees is through music sound of devotion...He introduces the tabla player, an equally renowned artist.
Shri Mataji seems to explain to Debu Chaudhuri that it is not a puja but a spiritual event.

Shri Mataji: Now, I must say, that artist himself being a Realized soul, I’m just working on your Kundalini, I need not speak much. It’s working out. So don’t get impatient, this is also, is a silent speech of God’s music. So you just don’t get impatient about it.
I’am also enjoying very much.
May God bless you.
Since Kambhoji, he’s going to play just now.

Debu Chaudhuri: Well, it is my great pleasure, in a way, I requested Mataji to give Her blessings to all of you, instead of playing. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] She refused and She said I must play.

Shri Mataji: No. I’m giving blessings to your music, I’ve said.

Debu Chaudhuri: It’s a great honour for me and I have no words to express my gratitude to Mataji. So I’ll play, She has requested a particular raga called Kamboji, which is a mixture of Jhinjhoti and Kalawati.

Shri Mataji: Oh, a blend [? not clear].

Debu Chaudhuri: Yes.

Music starts.
