New Year Puja, Kalwe (India),  January 1st, 1991

Translation from Hindi:

Today we are going to perform a Puja in a place close to Mumbai, or Bombay.  The original name of Bombay was Mumbai.  This contains three words – Mum, Amba, and Aiyee.  In Marathi language we address Mother as Aiyee.  Even in the Vedas, Adi Shakti was referred to as Eee.  So the reflection of Adi Shakti is Aiyee.  That is why Mother is called Aiyee.  Also, the Mother is called Ma in many  languages.  That is why the first sound is mm in Mumbai.  And Amba, as you all know, is verily the Kundalini.  So this Trigunatmika is three words.

And in Mumbai also the three Devis, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali are in an awakened state, and a beautiful temple has been dedicated to all three Shaktis,  where, from Mother Earth, all these three Devis emerged.  A lot of wrong activities and rituals have been brought into use by many people.  But inspite of this, these three Devis exist in an awakened state here.  So the people of Mumbai should try to understand and realise the special reason why this happened here. Nowhere else have these three Devis manifested together; so something must have caused this to happen.

As you already know, Mahasaraswati manifested in Mahudgadh; Bhavani (Shree Mahakali) manifested in Tuljapur, and Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur.  And in Wani, the half syllable (Ardhmatra), which we call as Adi Shakti, has manifested.

But here, all three Murtis (manifestations) are Jagrut (in an awakened state).  Whenever, and wherever there is a strong manifestation, and a lot of divine work is being done by Chaitanya, the reason emerges that in those places there are big negativities which become the causal for these happenings.  And it is mainly for the destruction of these negative forces and elements, that such manifestations of Divine Presence takes place.

For example, in the Arabic countries, Zoroasther took birth five times,  and later many Adi Gurus took birth, like Abraham, Moses, and last of all Shri Mohammed Sahib also took birth there.  Because it was very necessary, and that is why these Gurus took birth to accomplish some definite work.

Regarding Mumbai, it is said, that the people of this place lived a life of over abundance, excesses, and a life of outward attention, and  materialistic attachment.

There is a story of a boy called Pundalik, who decided to take his father and mother on a pilgrimage.  They were very old, and could not walk, so he carried them in two baskets balanced on either side of a beam across his shoulder.  On the way he came to the city of Bombay.  It looked like a nice place, so he decided to break journey and rest there.

Now actually the Chaitanya of this place had been completely destroyed by the materialistic lifestyle of excesses of the people living there.  While he was resting there;  the negative nature of that place invaded his thoughts, and influenced his reasoning.  He began to think – What am I doing, taking my parents on a pilgrimage in such difficult circumstances.  What benefits will I gain out of this difficult task.  Because it is a brahmin temperament to calculate and measure what advantage they will get out of a particular deed.  So he reasoned within himself that he was not going to gain anything by taking his parents any further on the pilgrimage.  So he told his parents that from there on they would have to fend for themselves, as it was not possible for him to complete the pilgrimage.

The parents began to wonder what had gone wrong with their son. Also they felt that the vibrations of this city were not good, and there was no flow of Chaitanya.  So they said, “Alright.  We will find our own way, but you just take us out of this city and leave us.  You take us out, and from there we will find our way. But before that, we will just go round and have a look at the city, and then we will leave the place.”  He agreed, thinking that this is a good decision, and I will have no more headache of looking after my parents.  He also kept thinking within himself, that what a nuisance I have taken upon myself.  He was also beginning to feel aches and pains all over his body and shoulders, after bearing the load of both his parents.

Then they went out of Bombay. They must have reached Kalwe.  Because by some good fortune, Kalwe is situated outside of Mumbai!  When he reached Kalwe he suddenly felt very strong and refreshed.  He wondered what was happening, and he felt a strange change in his mind as well.  He apologised, and begged his parents to forgive him, and said he did not know from where such negative thoughts had come into his mind.  He said – Please forgive me.  I will fulfil my sacred duty and take you on the pilgrimage”.

In this place there are two Sarovars (Lakes).  One is called Pampa, and it is described in the scriptures.  The second one has been mentioned in the Ramayana.  This means that before Shri Rama went to Dandakaran, He came here.  And wherever He walked he filled the place with His Chaitanya.  In addition to this, in Maharashtra, a lot of holy men have come.  Inspite of the fact that these holy men were troubled and dishonoured, still they came, again and again, and tried to raise the people morally and spiritually.   Even though holy people kept  visiting, there were still negativities being generated by some very wrong elements here.

The Ashta Vinayak (8 Ganeshas), and the three-and-a-half peethas (coils); and most of all the manifestation of the three aspects of the Devi in one place, indicates that  there must have been some  very great and severe negativity (dosh) here, and that is why there was such a concentration of Divine presence here.  Also My birth took place here.

So one must ponder as to what great negative force is here, which has become the causal for such a lot of Divine activity here.

The overabundance has caused over indulgence in lifestyle, and the attention is outward and materialistic.

First the English explorers came, and taught English language, English culture, and also how to be selfish and materialistic. Whatever they taught them, caused their attention to wander outside and get attached to material things.  The English stayed here a long time and started liking to live in Mumbai. Later, through the sea routes, the Portuguese landed in Maharashtra, and so also explorers from other countries. They all left their influence on the local people.  They changed their priorities and became materialistic and self indulgent.  From the beginning itself these people were materialistic, but now they became more and more outward, more greedy, and their attention got attached to material possessions.  And even today there is a lot of materialism and outward show in the people of Mumbai.

And that is why, even after coming into Sahaja Yoga this materialistic attitude sticks on to them. And because of these attachments, they are not able to rise and gain greater heights in spirituality as it is happening in other places.  This is very surprising, because after all the time and trouble that I have spent here, which is more than I spent in North India, these people have not been able to settle down in Sahaj.  The growth that has been accomplished in North India, I have not been able to achieve here.

The reason is that there is a lot of inertia, and attachment to material things.  Even in spirituality there is attachment to gurus who can promise material growth.  Which I feel is not in North India.  They do not encourage false gurus there.  It is these people here in Maharashtra, who like false gurus who promise wealth; or Tantriks who help them to take revenge and cause distress to others.   Thirdly there are a lot of false gurus who have caught hold of materialistic people, and teach them that they do not have to do very much for worshipping God.  Just take the name of God, and continue with this lifestyle, or that lifestyle that they are already living.  Such Gurus do not have any pure desire that their followers should grow spiritually and become good people.

Then there are some gurus who may not be false, but they do not feel any sense of responsibility towards the spiritual growth of their followers.  They do not feel that these people have looked after us so well and given us so much, and we should uplift them morally and spiritually.  They just sit back and do nothing.

Then there is the fourth type; the brahmins, who surprise Me.  They are the ones who fought that there should be no caste system; that there should be widow remarriages; and there should be no discrimination of any kind.  They have also produced writers and poets like Agarkar sahib and Rishen Saraswati.  Even some saints, like Sant Ramdas.  All worked really hard to establish (Adhyatmak) relationship of the soul with the spirit.  They actualised the Marathi saying (Amazhi man ki brahman; Amhi Jaaneli nahin Brahma. Amhitasli Brahman nahi) They awakened within us the awareness that  “If you do not know the Brahma, you cannot be a Brahmin” .  And they strived in every way to remove Brahminism, caste consciousness, and other differences.

But now in the modern times I am observing that it is the brahmins who have been most affected by modernism.  If you see a lady with a short, fancy haircut, wearing dark glasses and smoking a cigarette, it will invariably be a brahmin lady.  Now how this change has come about is beyond My understanding.  It seems to be slavish following of fashion that has changed these women.

And the upper class that used to be known as Maratthas, and who carried swords, are now cutting each others throats.  What else to do with the swords.  They probably thought that we once used to fight with these swords for Shivaji Maharaj.  Now we can use them to cut off each other’s  heads.  This is how things have changed for the worse.

And a third thing is that there is no  Vysia (traders) community here. .  Because in Maharashtra no one knows how to do business. Being very outspoken and unable to control their tongues, they cannot manage business.  So among whom could spirituality be established and nurtured.  Who will accept it.  I am unable to find people whom I can establish in spiritual life.  Trying to eradicate these wrong ideas, and self destructive behaviour, is not only impossible; but one cannot even prevent them from going deeper and deeper into the mire.  They are so enmeshed in materialism they cannot be extricated, and are not prepared to understand that caste and wealth consciousnesss is harmful and detrimental to their spirit.  And that it is a big lie.

So we should put our attention on these harmful and dangerous trends that are trapping the people of this place.  Actually they are simple and honest people, and their craving for wealth and material possessions, is on a small scale.  Not a massive one. And their minds are clean.  Also they have great reverence and faith in Shri Ganesha.  This is a great asset, and is probably the reason why their morality is safe.  This is a great asset for us, that they still have a strong moral sense.  And in My understanding,  it is only where there is moral sense, that some work can be accomplished.  I have seen that where there is no moral sense, the Divine work takes a longer time to take effect.

But now I see from experience that whether there is moral sense or not, unless they have depth, they cannot come into Sahaja Yoga.  In these parts lots of people come into Sahaj; especially in the villages they come in great numbers, but they do not settle down.  The main reason for this is that they do not have depth and power of absorption.  So whatever puja we are going to do, we must decide, that taking everything  into consideration, this defect or deficiency of Maharashtra has to be removed, and Sahaja Yoga has got to be established in Maharashtra.  We should understand that in every place there will be a lack of depth and understanding; and that no person has become complete and self contained.  Everyone has some drawback or other, even though it could have been influenced by the outsiders who came and occupied this country.  Everyone should understand this, and work towards eradicating it.  We can accomplish a lot in these areas because it has the blessings of all those holy men and saints who came here in the past. They have laid a good foundation for us.  So as we are sitting under the canopy of blessings of the early saints, we also have reinforcement of vibrations from the manifestation of the three Shaktis.  We will get a lot of support; and we have to ensure that Sahaja Yoga develops and grows very fast here.

It has been seen that those who are already in Sahaja Yoga are not giving their full effort and support to the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.  In a way they are trying to escape responsibility, and avoid working for Sahaja Yoga.  If you try to save yourself and shirk  your responsibilities, then God will also save His energy and reduce His attention on you.  As much work and effort as you put in for Sahaja Yoga, you will be blessed out of proportion.  One thing we must understand, that Kruta Yuga, ( the first of the Golden Age) has started.  Before this we can say that it was Kaliyuga (the darkest of the four ages).  In Kaliyuga whatever you committed or omitted, was tolerated.  But now in Kruta Yuga whatever wrong things you do, the repercussions are immediate.  And whatever good deeds you do, are rewarded immediately.  So I would say the circumstances are prevalent in the environment or atmosphere.  Therefore whatever we do, we should be watchful of our motives and our actions.  Because the reaction and repercussion is immediate.  Those who do good deeds will be rewarded immediately.  That is the order of the day.

So with great understanding we should make a resolution, that if we are living in Mumbai, it is the fruits of these saints’ labours that all of you are here in Sahaja Yoga today; and all of us should introspect today as to what is our responsibility  towards Sahaja Yoga.  Every night we should sit and introspect that what have we done today for Sahaja Yoga.  Mostly we do only those things from which we gain benefits or boons. What do we do for Sahaja Yoga.  Those who avoid working for Sahaja Yoga and do not spend their time and labour for Sahaja Yoga, will one day come to Me and say, Shree Mataji we have been afflicted with this problem and that problem.  Because when you do nothing for God, then God has nothing to do with you, or for you.  If you want Param Chaitanya’s attention on you, then you should  daily introspect and ask yourself what have I done for Param Chaitanya or Sahaja Yoga today.  Have I worked for Sahaja Yoga with my whole body, soul, and attention.  It is only from this activity that you will get abundant blessings from the Divine; and you will be able to see how many blessings you get by working for Sahaja Yoga. You have been given a seat in the Kingdom of Param Chaitanya (God Almighty).  And just as you get corrected or chastised in other kingdoms, even in God’s kingdom you are corrected or punished according to your deeds.  You are not condemned, but are given signals as warnings to correct yourself.  If you do not change yourself, your vibrations get lesser, and sometimes even stop.  So we have to watch ourselves with every step that we take.

It is of utmost importance that Sahaja Yoga has to grow in Maharashtra; and from here, spread to the rest of the world.   And that is why I urge you to make promises and resolutions because the New Year has started.  We should promise that we will surrender ourselves to Sahaja Yoga, and get fully immersed in its blessings.  For that we will have to use all our faculties and resources to make Sahaja Yoga grow; and nurture and spread it far and wide.  This is for all.  Not only for Maharashtrians.  I am speaking to all the people of the world.

English Talk:

I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because most of them are Hindi-knowing people and I've just told them what is the importance of Bombay, and why so many incarnations came here, and why Shri Rama had to walk in the villages and the hills and dales of Maharashtra, what was the need, and the need is that they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

Also, this would be the last Puja for all of you, in India. I hope you all have gained a lot in these different Pujas and different places we have been to.

Only thing is that one should remember that Krita Yuga has started. Now Kali Yuga is over, Krita Yuga has started, and in this Yuga - that the Paramchaitanya is absolutely effective and very efficient.

Now if you do anything wrong it will punish you. It may not punish immediately but it will give you a suggestion, it will give you a proper signal that something is going wrong with you. But if you do not try to control your footsteps then you may go down very fast.

So you have to be very careful about that. Actually, I have told you so many times that there are two forces working, one which attracts you inside and one which throws you out.

So, it is important for all of us, all of us to remember that this Krita Yuga is there, and in that this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

Also, you are rewarded. You have been telling me so many stories, how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj it has happened, all of you have been telling Me very nice stories. But it is part of your play in Sahaja Yoga and that you are placed in the kingdom of God.

So, in the kingdom of God you are there, try to enjoy it, that's the only thing you have to do is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

But if you try to, sort of, dislocate yourself from this joy, break the connection of joy by some sort of thinking, which is not reality, then you are responsible for yourself.

So, I have to tell you that keep the connection on. Not only that, but try to make it stronger and stronger, and become one with that divine force permanently, which will flow through you and will not only enlighten you but will give you so many powers, and you will see the new life in this new year.

Yesterday, as I requested you, we have to work it out now. Individually, we have to go all out to see that we spread Sahaja Yoga and talk about it.

On this day I give you complete freedom to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.

You need not ask Me any permissions, and you can try everything that you want to. But should be something decent, should not be something indecent and something which is not behoving a sahaja yogi. Even if you have to write letters or answers or anything, even if you have to show the anger, it should be done in a very decent and a beautiful manner. And it should show that it's a yogi who is talking.

The other things, whatever problems you have, will be solved in no time. But the main problem is yourself, which should be solved by you by meditative methods.

And so much attention we are paying to all our extra-curricular activities but that will definitely fail, it will boomerang on you if you do not have the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

It is very important to keep attention on your spirit all the time so that whatever you are doing, whatever you are projecting, has the base and you just don't get lost.

This is a very important thing, and I am sure that you will understand that without the nourishment from the roots you cannot grow.

So this nourishment must be kept alive.

May God bless you. Thank you very much.
