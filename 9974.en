Evening Program before Mahashivaratri Puja, Castle Mountain Camps, Wiseman's Ferry, near Newcastle, NSW, Australia.

[At the end of the evening program, after a play has been performed by sahaja yogis about Shiva, the three Shaktis and the time of creation, and the gift of knowledge to Eve; then the progressive separation of human beings from Divine dharma, and the request for support of the Shaktis to Dattatreya, who listens and sends His incarnations on the Earth to try and restore the balance in a lost and misled humanity.

Finally, when Shiva is going to start the destruction, the Shaktis propose to send the Mother, the only One who can awaken the Power in human beings, making them enlightened masters of their own. Shiva agrees and, listening to Shri Mataji’s Breath, the protagonists assume spontaneously a position of meditation. The play ends with all sahaja yogis singing “Swagat. Agat. Swagatam” (Welcome) to Shri Mataji.]

Congratulations to Brian Bell and to all the... (applause). I said congratulations to Brian Bell (applause) (inaudible words during clapping) and to all the actors and actresses. (Applause)

To be very frank I never think of my past (Shri Mataji laughs, laughter). So I was wondering what is this drama going about (laughter).

The most important thing in this life is to enlighten as many people as possible. I am very much thankful to you for expressing your joy, your talents to express the reality.

Reality is not in which what we believe but it is beyond. But the way people believe in reality is something illusion, illusionary. That is the curse of Kali Yuga.

I must say it is brought out very well, the way you showed people around, but not easy to convince so easily, I tell you (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). Now it’s different. It used to be very difficult in the beginning – too many arguments and all kinds of funny answers and questions. Now life has changed I think – we are so many, so many good Sahaja Yogis, and in Australia I am sure it’s going to be a very tremendous success.

I was surprised at the way people had to stand outside in that big hall, shows the awakening is spreading and people are now trying to understand that there is something beyond.

It’s only your behaviour, it’s only your vibrations which has created this.

If I could do everything myself alone, I would not have needed anyone. But no I can’t do it, I have to have channels, and I have to do it through you. When the channels are so good, they are working it out for me.

Now I look back sometimes because just now you were showing the past that first coming to Australia I just thought it’s a Ganesha’s land and things will work out. It has, I must say, it has worked out very well, so many people are showing their talents, it’s amazing how they can sing Indian songs or do these Indian dancing, it’s very amazing.

And this play of Shiva was also another great achievement I think in expressing how all the religions said the same thing.

But as you know people have misinterpreted for their own purposes. I am so very happy all of you had found out the reality about yourself, the reality about life and the Spirit that is within you.

I never expected so much to happen in My lifetime, I thank you for that.

May God bless you all.
