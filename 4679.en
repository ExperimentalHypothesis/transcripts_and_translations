“Understanding the Love of God”, Public Program, Caxton Hall, London (UK), 11 May 1982.

For the last so many lectures we have been saying that you cannot pay for God’s Love. It makes Me laugh sometimes. Human beings can never understand His Love because they live in a very limited sphere. His Love is unlimited. His forgiveness is unlimited. Even this word “unlimited” and “infinite” we do not understand because we have not known anything like that and to say that something is genuine is also like certifying something which is genuine. You don’t need a certificate. Even that human beings do not understand.
We live with artificialities. We try to find the Truth. Again we accept artificiality as Truth. Again we go on fighting. Then we think this is the Truth. Again that turns out to be something, artificial thing or some sort of a mental projection.
All these limited endeavours of human beings and experiences they have made him so conditioned that it is not easy to understand God.
He made all this universe in His compassion and love. He created you also as human beings in His Love. He doesn’t need anything. But He loves. And you can’t understand a person who loves beyond any reason, without any reward — just love because love for love’s sake.
We can’t think of one human being like that who can love only for love’s sake.
Only after realization, as you grow more and more, you realize that loving gives is the greatest joy....
He didn’t make this world to get any fruits out of it. Nothing. He just made it because He loved and He wanted just to express His Love. Just to manifest that Love, He made this world. There’s nothing else expected and to put the human mind at that level is an impossivbility, I find, in the beginning. But gradually they start understanding how forgiving He is, how kind He is, how nice He is....
...This vicious circle is set in. This ego-oriented circle, or another word, is set in. Another vicious circle and another vicious circle and another vicious circle, we go on from one to another, moving on the wheel after wheels without realizing from where we are going. And this vicious circle has to be broken by one faith, by one understanding — that God is forgiveness, God is Love. When we feel love for anyone, without any lust and greed, then that is God’s Love within us, that he is the embodiment of that pure Love which just loves, which has given you this beautiful human life and wants to make you even more beautiful.
He created all this creation for you and that He wants you to enjoy the bounties of this creation. He wants you to enjoy the citizen of His Realm and the Kingdom of His Grace.
Do we go to see someone who is highly placed with a morose face? Do we? That they will specially brush our hair, see, make our hair into a beautiful thing, make our face nice, dress up well to look that we are well, see. That’s outside. Inside, if you just feel how He is, how He has worked out meticulously this blissful life of a human being. But think how much He has done for us. Instead of that, if you are all the time to say, “I am very unhappy in life.” I mean, think of someone who does everything for you and you just come back saying, “Oh, I am just a very unhappy person.” What is he going to feel about? No gratitude. Count your blessings one by one. That’s what one has to do, is to have complete understanding that He is God Almighty. He can do anything that He likes and we are the reciprient of His All-might. He is the Ocean of Love and we are the reciprient of His Love. Let us feel that within ourselves and understand logically with wisdom.
If this sets into your mind, that’s the best conditioning that I think human beings can have.
