Two quotes (MAHA AVATAR, ISSUE 1, JUL-SEP 1980, PAGE 11)

"The New revolution in your awareness has to take place otherwise all human achievements have no meaning. It would be like arranging all the electrical decorations for the marriage without the electrical current But when the light be on, you will seethe Bridegroom and the Bride."

"My children, you must know I am beyond insults and Pain. Do you know that when Christ was crucified he was a witness to his pain ? He can never be humiliated. But these people are under the pressure of the satanic forces. We have to save them. Do you want them to go to hell ?"
