Shri Mataji: Children do not look at the clock or understand time and do not get upset about time schedules. My desire is that you please remove your watches and ignore the time. Relax, sit comfortably, and listen to your mother. Don’t carry the weight or heaviness in your head. Sit in front of your mother as a child would. Just like a child rests their head on the lap of their mother, forget about work, office, and business. Please relax in front of your mother.

There were some uneducated villagers traveling by train for the first time. They put all their baggage on their heads, and when someone asked why, they said, "We are making the train carry less weight." But the truth is, the train was carrying all of their baggage. There's no point in carrying weight on your head. Similarly, you think you're carrying the weight of the world, but in reality, it is God almighty that is carrying the weight, not you.

Suppose this microphone thinks it is doing everything when in reality it is just one instrument used to project my talk. We are just the toys of the Paramatma (God). When you realize this, you understand that life is like a drama. It’s just like watching a play about the great King Shivaji of Maharashtra. During the play, it seems like we are fighting a war with swords, but when the play ends, we realize it was all just a performance. In the same way, God almighty is doing everything, and we are just part of this life’s drama. It’s all an illusion—once we have realization, we see it for what it is. This is called the Maya (illusion) and Leela (divine play) of God.

There is a difference between children and us. Children understand that it’s just play, but we mistake it for reality. We need peace of mind (Man Shanti). Inside us, we have the power of Paramatma (God), which is the greatest power of love. It is this love that makes our hearts beat and keeps the world running, yet some people are afraid of it. We often want to understand it, rather than just feel it. But this is the absolute truth. God’s love is the reason this power was created, and it exists in all human beings.

Now, I will explain this absolute truth very clearly. I have a blackboard here to help explain, so please imagine you are in school, and I, your mother, am going to teach you. Listen carefully, and don’t overthink it.

For example, this microphone works now, but there is a lot of technology and electronics behind it, amplifying the sound through complex circuitry. We don’t always think about this—our only concern is how the sound is amplified. Similarly, God’s power and how He created human beings and how it works are very complex, but I will explain it in a simple and easy way. Please listen carefully, as Sahaja Yoga is very simple and easy.

Some people (Buddhi-wadi) however, judge God based on their intellect. 

When a child is in the womb of the mother, approximately 2 to 3 months into gestation, at this time, the power of God, enters the child through the developing brain passing down the spine to the sacrum bone. This power sits at the base of the spine and creates the three main nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna). During this phase, the mind, intellect, ego, and attention are not active.

There are two types of shakti (power): jada shakti (which is a power without consciousness or physical form) and chaitanya shakti (the conscious power, which is the pure love of God). The rays of chaitanya shakti, the power of God’s love, activate jada shakti, and this activation is what causes the human body to function.

In the human body, the mind, intellect and heart are activated by the Chaitanya to work together. The divine power of love, which we call chaitanya shakti, functions like a light that enters the brain. The brain is like a prism. When the light passes through a prism, it refracts and splits into seven colours. Similarly, there are four main light rays or powers that flow through the nervous system in the body. However, today I will focus on three of these main powers, as the fourth is less important.

The first power is the channel that travels through the central nervous system in the spine, from the sacrum bone at the base of the spine. This bone houses an energy known as kundalini.

You might wonder why this is not understood by physicians or doctors. I have studied medicine, and if you ask most doctors about the parasympathetic system, they will often say they are unfamiliar with it. This is called A sushumna—the central channel of energy that mirrors the parasympathetic system. Some people refer to it as the autonomic nervous system, which controls functions like heartbeat and breathing. Doctors often say they cannot control or interact with this system.

The Asushumna regulates the heart rate, breathing, and digestion. For example, if a person suffers from constipation, it could turn into diarrhoea as part of a self-correcting process. People who have awakened this energy, or balanced it, often display signs such as dilated pupils, indicating that their parasympathetic system is activated.

Now, in the body, there are two other channels called the sympathetic nervous system, often studied by doctors. However, only those who have reached a state of realization (called drushta) can balance these internal systems. There are centres of energy located in the spine that have connections in our hands and head. 

There are three primary channels: the central channel which is the parasympathetic nervous system, or sushumna nadi; the Bida nadi or chandra nadi (moon channel), which corresponds to the left sympathetic nervous system; and the Cpingala nadi or surya nadi (sun channel), corresponding to the right sympathetic nervous system. Some people know these as Yin and Yang.

In medical terms, the 4Anahata chakra (heart chakra) is associated with the cardiac plexus. There is also a small void below it that doctors recognize. When these two channels (BIda and CPingala) are active, energy flows between them, particularly between the second chakra (swadhisthana) and the fourth chakra (4 Anahata). There is another important energy center in this area called the 3manipura chakra or nabhi chakra, which is linked to the navel.

When the umbilical cord is cut, it severs the connection to the Manipura chakra, and the stomach becomes hollow, which is known as the 3a Bhavasagara chakra.

Now, when the Ida and Pingala channels are activated, a person’s energy can shift. If a person is too work-oriented then the right side becomes over active and the left side becomes depleted of energy. Now if I have pain in one hand, I may use the other hand to alleviate the pain with massage. If the autonomic nervous system is activated, the yogi can fix such imbalance instantly, much like healing.

These powers work throughout the body to correct imbalances. The power of the right side, called Ckriya shakti, is responsible for action and functionality. However, if this power becomes imbalanced or damaged, it can lead to issues like cancer. For instance, if a person consumes too many chilies or spicy foods, it can create a balloon-like growth in the stomach due to this imbalance, which doctors may call cancer.

Cancer is becoming more prevalent worldwide, and I believe the cure lies in Sahaja Yoga meditation. We have successfully treated many patients, but doctors are still sceptical. One day, perhaps in 10 years, when Sahaja Yoga is recognized in the West especially in America (USA), they will acknowledge its potential to cure cancer. Our goal is not just to cure cancer, but to help people achieve health and spiritual upliftment.

Only cancer can be cured by Sahaja Yoga. People keep asking more and more to cure cancer as a test, and we are tired of curing it. Doctors take money for it, but doctors should study this method, which is free, and understand its deep meaning. They shouldn't just take money. If they understood it and started curing cancer, we could shift our attention to something else that is important. People always say, "You are curing cancer," but what we are doing is not just curing cancer. We are using the middle channel power through which God's love flows.

Regarding the left side, there is dormant energy. Doctors say that this power is not operating, but that's not true. God has placed everything in our bodies to work. This side keeps a record of things that are "dead” or of the past. Psychologists are attempting to study this but doctors don't fully understand psychology, and psychologists don't fully understand doctors. Both sciences are valid. When these two channels are activated, it's like filling a car with petrol. Eventually, these two channels form a balloon near the crown chakra (7 Brahmarandra), representing the ego and superego. Before this, the power of God's love was active, but these two balloons—ego and superego—close off the channel like a lid.

At this point, we start saying "I am," but in reality, we are not, because the connection with the power of God's love is closed off. We think we are doing everything ourselves, but it's actually God who does everything; we are not doing anything.

"I want to do something" is not the true path. We need to get self-realization first, and then the reconnection happens. Only then is the "machine" ready to start a new life. Once the dormant Kundalini power is awakened and you achieve self-realization, you will understand everything from within and feel its effects. When the Kundalini rises to the head 

(7 Brahmarandra), you will gain inside-out knowledge of how the power of God's love works miraculously.

However, this is not possible automatically. People read thousands of books about Kundalini awakening, and some even go mad from it. The fear is real for many. To awaken it properly, we need jagruti(awakening by an authorized guru or master). But I have not seen anyone properly awaken Kundalini now days, though we know that it was done in the past.

As a child, I often wondered how to fill the gap or void in the stomach and get the Kundalini to pass through the void chakra (energy centre). I don’t think many children have such questions. Now, this middle channel is crucial, and this is where the Kundalini energy must flow. But once awakened, this power must be used which is why the left and right channels need to be activated.

The left and cright channels, like the fuel in a car, use up the power, and then it’s "spent." The main question is: once Kundalini is awakened, how do we fill the big void gap and pass the energy further? In the past, people tried to do this, but when the energy reaches the 2Swadhishthana chakra, it either goes to the left or the right. If it goes to the left, the person may act mad or behave erratically. If it goes to the right, the person becomes overly religious or too "dharmic." But this power must travel through the central channel.

Paramatman (God Almighty) is not in anyone's control. Some people may say, "Get to Paramatman by any means," but that’s not possible. This is all an automatic process. For example, if I plant a seed in the ground, it doesn't matter what I do—whether I dance, pray, or put sand on my head—the seed will sprout naturally when it is time. It will happen automatically and grow into a tree. All important work happens automatically, just like breathing—it happens without our control. Nowadays, people treat breathing exercises like they have control over it, but it happens naturally.

All bodily functions are automatic. If we say we are doing them, we are moving toward the right side, the active ego. For example, some people go to temples and build up their ego. They should be at peace inside, and all their illusions should disappear. Instead, today's younger generations seem angry and think there is nothing in it. There's nothing wrong with seeking the divine, but too much ego or false pride leads us away from Paramatman (God Almighty).

Some people think they can become greedy or "haughty" and gain God's love or power, but this is not possible.

The left side is related to the collective subconscious. For example, a man may sing bhajans (worship songs) with cymbals, and his garland may end up on the idol in a temple. But God doesn’t do this; He doesn’t have time for it. How does the garland get from the man to the idol, or vice versa? It's not God's doing—it happens because the spirit of a saintly person, who is no longer alive, does such work.

I didn’t intend to speak about this, but someone mentioned "Bhanamati" (a form of black magic), where objects like clothes, cups, and dishes fly around the house. God does not perform such tasks; these are the workings of spirits or ghosts (bhoots). Not all spirits are bad, though; some are good, and some may be the spirits of saints, like Ramakrishna Paramhansa, who was a realized soul.

A realized soul does not possess anyone. They respect other people's freedom. Some people perform puja to God, and in these cases, the spirit of a saintly person may come and help.

There was a doctor named Dr. Lang, who performed a famous international surgery known as Lang's surgery. After he passed away, he thought he hadn’t done enough work. One day, a soldier went to war and got scared, but Mr. Lang's spirit possessed his body and told him to go to London and inform his brother and son about this. The soldier did so, and the family believed him because he knew all the details of their lives, even their little secrets. They were surprised and eventually accepted him and kept him as a doctor. After that, a number of doctors in that surgery began to be possessed by spirits and started curing patients at that clinic.

The procedure was simple: anyone could send a letter to Dr. Lang's surgery describing their health problems. After receiving the letter, they would schedule a time, and then the photo of Dr. Lang would be placed in front of them. After looking at it for a long time and concentrating (a form of Trataka), this activated the 6Agnya chakra. Then the person would begin to sweat, and their disease would be cured. This is how the entity, or ghost, enters the body from either the 6Agnya chakra or the 3Nabhi chakra.

If you bring these people to me afterward for realization and freedom, it’s not possible because they are too possessed. So, it’s impossible to introduce them to Paramatmas-God Almighty’s positive power. For such dangerous things, it's not good. For example, if due to disease, the body dies, but in the next life, this person may still achieve self-realization. However once these kinds of ghosts (bhoots) enter the body, it becomes impossible to clear them, and the path to God Almighty's love is not possible.

So, these Babajis (false gurus) in the market engage in this kind of business in Kaliyuga. They first pull out the spirit of the person, make two parts, and then the body falls into a state like a coma. Then, probably, the son of that person goes to these Babajis (false gurus) and asks them to cure his father. They ask for a huge amount of money. No one is able to kill anyone, but they create an illusion to take money and control. These things are called Smashan Vidya or Pret Vidya (knowledge of the dead from the cemetery). These kinds of practices have increased in Kaliyuga. ( In Hindu cosmology, Kali Yuga signifies the fourth and current age of the world, characterized by conflict, sin, and a decline in dharma and righteousness)

One question you must ask is, "What does God care about? What is important for God?” He is not interested in this. It doesn’t matter if you’re dead or alive. God could create another thousand lives.

What does God Almighty want?

When you get the new light of the lamp inside yourself and grow in life with positive power that is the desire of God Almighty. God is not interested in you as an individual; He could create thousands of lives just like yours. Does He care about fixing your body? He could create thousands of bodies like yours. A person who is interested in Paramatman (God Almighty) must be focused on God and nothing else. The central channel is important. If you go down the left channel, you’re heading toward the past life (Paraloka vidya ). If you go down the right side, it leads to becoming a workaholic, diseases like cancer, or an egoistic mindset.

If you read about Kundalini awakening, in the past, it was said that a person would experience fits or fainting, and some books mention getting big blisters on the head, like burns. I have seen it myself. I’ve witnessed in meditation that one person even jumped like a frog. When I asked, they said their Guru/Master gave them realization, and that’s why it happened. This seems nonsensical—like mocking God. Is God a donkey, asking you to jump like a frog?

Such things don’t happen here. We have awakened the Kundalini of thousands of people worldwide. Some people experience such things, and we need to pull their Kundalini down and make them okay. These people might feel that a Devi (Goddess) enters their body and moves in strange ways, like they’re mad. Do you think a Devi has time to enter someone’s body? In reality, it’s often women who have died, who come into the bodies of other women and create all this drama.

Many people struggle to let go of these ghosts (bhoots). For example, some gurus give a ring to someone, and the person ends up giving away all the jewellery from their home and money to these sadhus or gurus. If you wonder why these gurus need money that thought may bring you closer to true awakening. Now, how do you fill the middle void? The void can be filled with pure love, such as a mother’s love or pure love for the world. Only a realized person can fill this void with love, allowing the Kundalini to pass through it and rise upward for its upliftment. Sometimes, people may feel a heaviness in their head, but once it passes through the 7Brahmarandra (crown chakra), it connects to God Almighty, and the connection is made.

The first sign of this awakening is that the person becomes thoughtless. This is the first stage in yoga—the time between two thoughts, called "vilamb" (the space between two thoughts). Then, your attention (Chitta) automatically goes inward. Now, your attention is focused on me. If you’re trying to focus your attention anywhere else, it’s difficult, but with awakening, your attention automatically goes inward.

When there is an issue with a chakra (energy centre), we call it Badha (negativity). People with this issue may feel a slight burning sensation. For example, when people are swimming, one person may struggle while another can help them. But without knowledge, if someone tries to enter the water, flailing their arms, they’ll drown. In yoga, all you need to do is sit quietly, and it will work itself out.

For those who are realized, they now know how their Kundalini moves, where it is stuck, how to overcome obstacles, and how to move upward. They also understand how to work on the awakening of other people’s Kundalini. You will even understand the fingertips of your hands and how they relate to this process.

For example, if you feel a burning sensation on the ring finger, it indicates the energy of the 6Agnya chakra. If the sensation is on the middle finger, it’s related to the Nabhi chakra, sometimes with a stinging or burning sensation. We remove this with Chaitanya (divine energy) or some mantras. The 5Vishuddhi chakra, related to the index finger, is connected to the cervical plexus, which doctors recognize. If there is a burning sensation here and I place my index finger on it, the obstacle will go away.

The base of the hand corresponds to the 1Muladhara chakra (root chakra), and the middle of the palm relates to the 7Sahasrara chakra (crown chakra). You can feel it there. If this area is caught, there may be a problem in the 6Agnya chakra, extending up to the brain. Even children, after realization, can tell what’s wrong with a person. For example, a little girl named Sangita, who was 7 years old, went to Gwalior. Now children like her receive realization very quickly. If there’s too much cultural conditioning or workaholism children remain innocent and are not as captured by these forces, which is why they can quickly tell us what’s wrong.

Children, like a vice-chancellor, can give precise answers. For instance, there’s Mr. Chhatre (a Sahaja yogi), whose son Prasad I asked to sit in front of me. If someone hasn’t received realization (i.e., their Kundalini has not reached the 7Sahasrara or crown chakra), the child would simply say, “No, Shri Mataji, this person has not yet received realization.” This is the correct answer. Children don’t lie. With a little practice, they become experts at this. Sangita, for example, cured many people. I received letters from people who said that this 7-year-old girl had the power to cure. Actually, once the Kundalini is awakened and moves through the middle channel (the parasympathetic nervous system), God's love fills it, and it works out on its own. It’s not about doing anything—just awakening the Kundalini. Once it travels through the seven chakras and the central channel, it reaches the top. These two sides (left and right channels) come into play, and with it, we can tell the person’s problems from their fingertips. All diseases stem from imbalances in the seven chakras or energy centres.

The Kundalini is a dormant, coiled energy located at the top of the 1Muladhara chakra.

Doctors say there are 982 veins in the brain. The Sahasrara, the thousand-petal crown chakra at the top of the head, resembles the petals of a lotus. I’ve seen this myself. Though I haven't counted them, it’s close to 1000. These petals look soft, like flames of a gentle fire, and their colours are soft shades of blue, rose, purple, or orange. Beneath the petals, there is a stamen-like structure, similar in colour and metallic in appearance.

I have witnessed how the Kundalini awakens and have awakened the Kundalini of thousands of people. Now, at nearly 50 years old, I feel I fully understood this process when I reached the age of 47.

I’ve spoken on many subjects and done a lot of social work. I was on the film censor board, but I had never really spoken about spirituality. Some people asked why I hadn’t spoken about religion or Dharma, but without the practical aspect, there’s no point. I was waiting for the right moment. It’s like talking about rice when there is no rice to eat. There are many books on spirituality, but without practical experience, they are of little use.

Some people claim their guru/master gave them something, but did they explain it clearly and openly? The answer is no. I have already explained in great depth about psychology and Sahaja Yoga. Please read this information carefully.

Sometimes the beads in a garland may look different, but they are all linked together, aligned in the same direction. It happens that some people will not experience Kundalini awakening because it requires a lot of penance and tapasya (spiritual discipline). For these people, it’s not possible in this lifetime although some people may try to bypass this process. For instance, when we were children, people said we might go to the moon by plane. And now through hard work and discipline we've reached the moon.

Then, I did my research, and some people questioned me, saying, “You’re not a great scientist, just a simple housewife. How could this be possible for you?” Remember, no matter how big your achievements are, your mother is bigger than you. And yes, I’ve done this research.

Now, let’s get to the main part. We have to start meditation, but I can see that your Kundalini is awakened because I am sweating. The Kundalini is the loving mother of everyone; it resides within you, and it cares for you. Sometimes, this Kundalini tells me, “Please fix this child.” So, if you have complex problems, I first have to clear the obstacles, remove the complexity, and make it calm and cool, then work things out. For the child it needs to be easy.

In America, I had a different experience. Please don’t get angry. The youngsters aged 16 to 25 are very good. I thought that great and revered sadhus and yogis from India were born in America. People who are searching for truth from their heart have been born there. The same happened in Japan, and we got all the back stock here.

What happens there is that, at one time, 200 people might receive realization at one place, now 3000 people get their realization. Here, we see only a few people receiving it. Some people are there, using drugs and other harmful things in the name of spirituality.

People often judge others based on the car they drive. For example, I was at the market with my big car, buying vegetables, and a lady was cheating people. I confronted her, and she told me, “Back off. You have a big car, but how did you get it? Was it without cheating?” Maybe she’s right, but not in my case, of course. Everyone cheats for money, but can anyone take their property or money with them when they die?

But our children are good. Before they go to college, please give them realization. Once they go to college, we don’t know what goes into their heads. After they go to college, they often become rebellious, make fun of everyone, and become naughty. Of course, girls are often responsible for this.

Please start programs in schools and colleges; it’s very important. What I have found is that when mothers come to me, their children receive realization quickly and easily. It seems like they are Bharata Varsa (India’s great souls) who have already come here from the past. People from Maharashtra stick to it, but now they are trying to become too analytical for no reason.

I don’t mean Hindu, Muslim, or Christian, but when I refer to "Maharashtran," I mean someone who has grown up in Maharashtra, specifically in Mumbai. Now, it’s possible to receive this realization in the train or even in an airplane. The power has increased now.

When this power flows through your body, you will not feel tired—not just in the body, but it also affects your mind and inner self. So, get this realization. If you don’t accept it, that’s fine. For example, in Maharashtra, touching someone’s feet is often a sign of respect, but this is not necessary in Sahaja Yoga. Actually, vibrations come from my feet, and perhaps if you touch my feet, it may cure you. It could also bring prosperity to your house. But what’s more important is that you want to experience the love of Paramatman (God Almighty), and for that, you need to first receive this realization.

Otherwise, don’t come to my feet. Go to the stone idols if that’s what you believe in. I am not interested in you coming to my feet. Other gurus may want this—they get ministers to come and touch their feet, but I am not interested in that. I don’t need a certificate that ministers come to my feet. What your mother wants is to give everything to her child, all of it.

Now, I want to see how many children will come to receive this realization from me.

It’s time to take it. Please sit comfortably. Don’t sit with a heavy head; just like Shri Krishna’s leela (divine play), be at ease.

Some people have serious problems, and it’s okay for you to go and sit at the back. Some Sahaja Yogis will help you. For those who are feeling fear, open your eyes wide and sit in front of me.

Everyone else, please close your eyes. While I was talking, some of you have already received your realization since I am here. For example, if the Sun is shining, the light is bound to be there—there’s no question about that.

Now, close your eyes and watch your thoughts. Please don’t chant any mantra or take any name. It’s not that I’m against mantras, but first, your connection with the divine has to happen. Once you’ve received your realization, then you can chant the mantra or name.
