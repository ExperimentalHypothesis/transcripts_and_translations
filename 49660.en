Talk to Swiss Sahaja Yogis, February, 13, 1984, Bordi, India

Shri Mataji: As you had difficulties with the people who are very materialistic in Zurich, and in Lausanne with old people. So, you all should understand what difficulties Sahaja Yoga has because of such conditions. Materialism is too much in Switzerland. And it’s a [unclear], it’s a treachery, [unclear].

They have extracted all the money from all the countries, illegal stuff [unsure] to put it in their bank. And that’s how they have become rich, you see. And the result of that, the young people are committing suicide. Because the country has to pay for its sins.

Because of Switzerland, we have had problems in all the developing countries. Most of the poverty [unclear] in India is much more, is because of Swiss banks. All the money that come from other banks, as a help, goes to Swiss banks. And it corrupts anything. It corrupts any [unclear] into the [unclear] it has come from. So, people are so poor and starving despite the World Bank is helping, the world is helping. Instead of that, there are three very large organisations that are helping. Thus nothing goes to [unclear].

And the people say, at least all them that are trying to remember in the place of my forefathers, the wage of a woman is four rupees in a week. And of a man, it is eight rupees. Even if they have one child, that child survives, the parents are dying. They have no shoes; they have no proper cloth. They have nothing.
