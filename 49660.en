Talk to Swiss Sahaja Yogis, February the 13th, 1984, Bordi, India

Shri Mataji: As you had difficulties with the people who are very materialistic in Zurich, and in Lausanne with old people. So, you all should understand what difficulties Sahaja Yoga has because of such conditions. Materialism is too much in Switzerland. And it’s a [unclear], it’s a treachery, [unclear].

They have extracted all the money from all the countries, illegal stuff [unsure] to put it in their bank. And that’s how they have become rich, you see. And the result of that, the young people are committing suicide. Because the country has to pay for its sins.

Because of Switzerland, we have had problems in all the developing countries. Most of the poverty [unclear] in India is much more, is because of Swiss banks. All the money that come from other banks, as a help, goes to Swiss banks. And it corrupts anything. It corrupts any [unclear] into the [unclear] it has come from. So, people are so poor and starving despite the World Bank is helping, the world is helping. Instead of that, there are three very large organisations that are helping. Thus nothing goes to [unclear].

And the people say, at least all them that are trying to remember in the place of my forefathers, the wage of a woman is four rupees in a week. And of a man, it is eight rupees. Even if they have one child, that child survives, the parents are dying. They have no shoes; they have no proper cloth. They have nothing.

I, of course, blame our politicians also but because they are coming from poorer classes, not so much is done. This Swiss bank is [unclear] really to help them. So those people who indulge in such criminal acts and of such universal nature, or have to very arrogant or they have to shut their heads, because their minds there. Otherwise, if they see they cannot bear it. Otherwise, they’ll commit suicide.
So, how much sin there is on the [unclear], on the [unclear]? And this is the older generation. And the whole thing started by Masonic Lodge. And if you want to read about Masonic Lodge, I have a book on this History of Blake and he has described them as, really like devils, Masonic Lodge.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: This comes out [unclear].
Arnaud: They have links with the Vatican and the Catholic Church.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. They have the Vatican. So, all this comes from the older generation. Not that they don’t know about it. They all know, all the old people know that they are doing these filthy things. But they have covered their hearts with their ego and they are just like stones. They are like Hitler. They are Hitlers.

But Hitler was only for Germany. But this is a universal problem. But what to do now? Either we change our people here entirely and work it out, so that they discard the Swiss bank. But it's a very, very big and deep problem, you see, that the people [unclear] another style.
Now, another thing is that old people take time to change. That's why we can’t change them [unclear]. The conditioning is so much and they are so much more conditioned than young and their will power is already dead [unsure]. Like you see, John we had in our house the one I forgot-
Sahaja Yogi: John Watkinson.
Shri Mataji: John Watkinson.
He is a [unclear]. He is a [unclear]. John Watkinson. You see, he started to take drugs. And he [unclear]. And then he came to Sahaja Yoga with his parents. They have my photograph, they do puja, they do everything, but they can’t get over their drug habits.
They got into accident thrice, you see, but they said, "Mother, save us". They got hurt but they said, "Mother, save us". And that's the trouble, if they can't get out, they cannot enjoy their life. And as a result of that, Watkinson feels the left side. Though he is all right, but still, the left side is so powerful that it’s impossible even for him to enjoy.

So, in Sahaja Yoga, those who come, unless and until they believe that they are really born twice, and that they have a will power within them, they have to raise their will power and try to remain with the young, you see. And try to understand that younger people have more will power. And not to put the will of the old people on the young people because that's the only way they can exist. Otherwise- because they are lost now, in slavery [unsure]. It’s like your Mother. There is no other way out.

You know what, this is the reason why they all try to be young, in the West. They try to compete with men who are young by even doing the dances which are so difficult for old people. To be the cheer [unsure], old man, he is shaking. He's already shaking. He's already doing shake, what he can do? Horrible.
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s the other way round, you see. The young can move very fast in Sahaja Yoga, and the old sticking on to them, can move also fast.

Now here in India, we give you the example of, say, Warrick [unsure]. He must be about 70 something, I don’t know.
Sahaja Yogi: He is 76, Mother.
Shri Mataji: He is 76. But he such a friend of all the young, you see. He is such a moving force because he is just like a child. And the - the [unclear] it’s really childhood. Because eyesight is [new?], your teeth come back, it’s another childhood. And if somebody wants to accept it, it is that youngness within yourself. You can be young with the younger and think like them. Otherwise, it’s very lethargic.

And the young people, you see, have another problem that they are maybe funfooler [jokers]. I mean they try all nonsense, you see. Like getting nude in that Swiss sea [unsure]. I mean nobody can be believe in Switzerland, you are also nude, as it’s so cold. [Laughter]
I mean, it’s stupidity, absolute stupidity. Absolutely, I mean, like I call them the [unclear]. They are like donkeys.

So, but now [unclear] Sahaja Yoga, that the young have the will power. Let them rise and look after. And they mature in the right way. And the old people have matured in the wrong way already. But out of the hard-boiled eggs, are created chickens.
[Laughter]
So the chicks are, now you are the chicks and have that young attitude. You must have young attitude. Otherwise, you see, you’ll pull them down, at least.
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, we are very traditional but we are not orthodox. It’s discretion.
Because orthodoxy is the same thing what I call the hard-boiled stuff.

Now supposing, you try to give Self-Realisation to Khomeini. You could the - [unclear] knows everything about God.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Imagine, it's not only mountain, it's the Malek [unsure] that you cross there.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: It’s better to go to Gobi desert
Sahaja Yogi: Gobi desert.
Shri Mataji: It’s better to go to Gobi desert than to give Realisation to Khomeini.

One has to learn from a person like Warrick. What he does is he keeps all the accounts, keep people come and asking for advice to do their [unclear]. But he never speaks and interferes, whatever they are saying is perfect [unsure]. And that's how it work should out, because there are two extremes now in Switzerland.

And if the old people who are Realized have to show a way to the old, the hard-boiled, so the people who are- of course, they became younger, much younger after coming to Sahaja Yoga, that they should behave young. There’s one thing I find, why I used to think that they don't like each other, why that? [Unsure]. The reason is you don't know your Mother. If you know your Mother very well, if you know it's one Mother who is doing the [unclear] , if you love Me, you love each other.
And perhaps that is the reason why children, my children don't love each other as they should because they are not in unison.

If you, say, for example, people who don't know about their country, they’ll never be in fear.
Arnaud: About fears?
Shri Mataji: About fear. You see those, then you feel proud about it, "That’s my Mother! That's my Mother!" Everybody has the same feeling. They talk about the motherhood, mother land that's all we talk that, "Our motherland is so great, is that".
Now English people you ask them, even they are little [unclear] for their country, they know very little about [unclear]. They are very [unclear] you see, because it is [unclear] style. Every bit of that they know this is the style, this is the thing, and they're so proud of it that they love each other. This is the fun.
Sahaja Yogini: We learnt it in India, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see?
Sahaja Yogini: The collectivity was so strong [unclear] big fear.
Shri Mataji: You see, that is what it is. If you love Me and if you know Me, you will definitely be one. Because you will so proud of having a Mother like this, all of you will talk about Mother. But we talk about other things, you see, not about the Mother.
Arnaud: [Starts in French]
Shri Mataji: If you talk about the greatness of your Mother, of your love and affection, then you will have no fear.

And this is what Adi Shankaracharya has told you. Adi Shankaracharya has told you that you have to just talk about your Mother, that’s all.
So, like patriotism, if you have patriotism, you can say that it is ‘matriotism’.
[Laughter]

Arnaud: ‘Matriotism’, beautiful.
Another Sahaja Yogi: ‘Matriotism’.
Arnaud: Yes, beautiful word.

Shri Mataji: You see, I am the matrix. And the matrix in you, are the results [unsure]. You see, your matrix, your Kundalini is the matrix, that is a result [unsure]. That’s all your job, your style, your way is higher than anybody else. So you are the matrix. Matrix of the compassion, the love, to feel intense. You see, this is a very different attitude all together. You must know, you are now, you are living by your matrix and not by anything else, not by the mental.

[Arnaud translates]
Shri Mataji: The enjoyment of sacrificing, the enjoyment of bearing up.

I will tell you one story and then you’ll remember. Now if you remember this, that what I want that the young people should take the lead, they should do everything. And the old people should bless it and not to interfere with them. Don't give too much advice. That's the best way to do it and you’ll help them a lot. All right?
Now one story I will tell you. A very nice story, a Marathi story. It’s a very nice story, long time back. It's a very sweet story.
Sahaja Yogi: Can we translate that last part [unclear] Mother.

So, now the story is like this, that there was one boy, his name was Dina. And he had a mother, and he should go to school to learn mathematics. So, then his mother would tell him what to do that, "You take my blouses to the tailor. He has to stitch the patron on that. And then you have to go and get some things, vegetables from the market or anything". He started writing down how much work I do for my mother. And he used to list charges, so many charges for this, so many charges for that. 2 annas for bringing vegetables. 2 annas for taking-
[Unclear]
And he wrote a letter to the mother and put it under her pillow, hoping that she would read the letter and ask for [unclear].

So she was Indian mother, you see. So, Indian mother is a real matrix. She is not like your mothers that you have had, sort of, who always expect some in return of demand, demand you a personal [unclear]. Indian mothers are different.
So, after two, three days, she wrote a letter. And she wrote that, "I bore you in my womb for 9 months. No charge".
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogini: There is a song in French.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: There is a song in French about this story.
Shri Mataji: Like that.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Now she says that, "I gave you milk, you see, as nursery [Arnaud speaks at the same time] No charge. And when you were sick, I looked after you day in, day out. No charge". Like that she made a big list and at the end she said, "No charge. Total, no charge".

He felt a bit sad at it. He just [unclear] He just blessed her and he [unclear] the love.
Arnaud: It is that between the Sahaja Yogis and the Mother, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Something like that, all right? [unclear] not bother [unclear].
And he went back to the mother, embraced her and just covered her with his love and he slept with her. That’s what it is.
Sahaja Yogini: There is a very nice song in French, exactly about this story Mother. Exactly. It is on a record, what you said now. It is on a - somebody is singing it, in French.
Shri Mataji: He must have gone [unclear] from India.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, because it is exactly what you said. And I used to have [unclear].
Shri Mataji: That’s it. Cause the mothers are the worse in [unclear]
Arnaud: The mothers, Shri Mataji, you know that.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: You see, they are uneducated women and they have a [unclear] and they try to dominate too much. Ba, ba, ba! And if they cannot dominate, then they go into sort of a intrigue. They are intriguers. [Unclear] in their mind.
Arnaud: They go up to black magic and-
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. [Unclear]. They are dominating any woman.

So that's what I have to you.
Arnaud: Yes, Shri Mataji, all your blessings and your attention will put it in action, so that next time you come to Switzerland, please Shri Mataji, I hope that everything will work out.
Shri Mataji: All right. So, I told you that you can have that house, you stay there, settle down. And once you start growing well, then you get the other house. Everything happens in the same way.
Arnaud: Yes, Shri Mataji.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: And you can take the one of the copies of the school that they have started Sahaja Yoga. You should say, "It’s an accepted school in India", and you really can write about the hight court judges [unsure]. We are told that are many high Judges [unsure].
Arnaud: To whom should I send it to, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: To [unclear], you see. And when we went to India and see. Now this place when I occupied it, some people had already occupied the, another room. They came here. They found out and they said that, "We were staying with Mataji Nirmala Devi [unclear].
Arnaud: Yes, [unclear], Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All the great political leaders, [unclear]. So we have seen it. Nobody does to any minister or any other [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: You can't even get one politician into Sahaja Yoga, anywhere in the world. Let’s leave the politician, never have a chief minister [unsure].
Sahaja Yogini: What can I say? Most of them are crazy you know.
Shri Mataji: Crazy people [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Even businessman, how many tough businessmen you got now?
Shri Mataji: We had about 20 of the [unclear]. They are tools.
