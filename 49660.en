Talk to Swiss Sahaja Yogis, February, 13, 1984, Bordi, India

Shri Mataji: As you had difficulties with the people who are very materialistic in Zurich, and in Lausanne with old people. So, you all should understand what difficulties Sahaja Yoga has because of such conditions. Materialism is too much in Switzerland. And it’s a [unclear], it’s a treachery, [unclear].

They have extracted all the money from all the countries, illegal stuff [unsure] to put it in their bank. And that’s how they have become rich, you see. And the result of that, the young people are committing suicide. Because the country has to pay for its sins.

Because of Switzerland, we have had problems in all the developing countries. Most of the poverty [unclear] in India is much more, is because of Swiss banks. All the money that come from other banks, as a help, goes to Swiss banks. And it corrupts anything. It corrupts any [unclear] into the [unclear] it has come from. So, people are so poor and starving despite the World Bank is helping, the world is helping. Instead of that, there are three very large organisations that are helping. Thus nothing goes to [unclear].

And the people say, at least all them that are trying to remember in the place of my forefathers, the wage of a woman is four rupees in a week. And of a man, it is eight rupees. Even if they have one child, that child survives, the parents are dying. They have no shoes; they have no proper cloth. They have nothing.

I, of course, blame our politicians also but because they are coming from poorer classes, not so much is done. This Swiss bank is [unclear] really to help them. So those people who indulge in such criminal acts and of such universal nature, or have to very arrogant or they have to shut their heads, because their minds there. Otherwise, if they see they cannot bear it. Otherwise, they’ll commit suicide.
So, how much sin there is on the [unclear], on the [unclear]? And this is the older generation. And the whole thing started by Masonic Lodge. And if you want to read about Masonic Lodge, I have a book on this History of Blake and he has described them as, really like devils, Masonic Lodge.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: This comes out [unclear].
Arnaud: They have links with the Vatican and the Catholic Church.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. They have the Vatican. So, all this comes from the older generation. Not that they don’t know about it. They all know, all the old people know that they are doing these filthy things. But they have covered their hearts with their ego and they are just like stones. They are like Hitler. They are Hitlers.

But Hitler was only for Germany. But this is a universal problem. But what to do now? Either we change our people here entirely and work it out, so that they discard the Swiss bank. But it's a very, very big and deep problem, you see, that the people [unclear] another style.
Now, another thing is that old people take time to change. That's why we can’t change them [unclear]. The conditioning is so much and they are so much more conditioned than young and their will power is already dead [unsure]. Like you see, John we had in our house the one I forgot-
Sahaja Yogi: John Watkinson.
Shri Mataji: John Watkinson.
He is a [unclear]. He is a [unclear]. John Watkinson. You see, he started to take drugs. And he [unclear]. And then he came to Sahaja Yoga with his parents. They have my photograph, they do puja, they do everything, but they can’t get over their drug habits.
They got into accident thrice, you see, but they said, "Mother, save us". They got hurt but they said, "Mother, save us". And that's the trouble, if they can't get out, they cannot enjoy their life. And as a result of that, Watkinson feels the left side. Though he is all right, but still, the left side is so powerful that it’s impossible even for him to enjoy.

So, in Sahaja Yoga, those who come, unless and until they believe that they are really born twice, and that they have a will power within them, they have to raise their will power and try to remain with the young, you see. And try to understand that younger people have more will power. And not to put the will of the old people on the young people because that's the only way they can exist. Otherwise- because they are lost now, in slavery [unsure]. It’s like your Mother. There is no other way out.

You know what, this is the reason why they all try to be young, in the West. They try to compete with men who are young by even doing the dances which are so difficult for old people. To be the cheer [unsure], old man, he is shaking. He's already shaking. He's already doing shake, what he can do? Horrible.
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s the other way round, you see. The young can move very fast in Sahaja Yoga, and the old sticking on to them, can move also fast.

Now here in India, we give you the example of, say, Warrick [unsure]. He must be about 70 something, I don’t know.
Sahaja Yogi: He is 76, Mother.
Shri Mataji: He is 76. But he such a friend of all the young, you see. He is such a moving force because he is just like a child. And the - the [unclear] it’s really childhood. Because eyesight is [new?], your teeth come back, it’s another childhood. And if somebody wants to accept it, it is that youngness within yourself. You can be young with the younger and think like them. Otherwise, it’s very lethargic.

And the young people, you see, have another problem that they are maybe funfooler [jokers]. I mean they try all nonsense, you see. Like getting nude in that Swiss sea [unsure]. I mean nobody can be believe in Switzerland, you are also nude, as it’s so cold. [Laughter]
I mean, it’s stupidity, absolute stupidity. Absolutely, I mean, like I call them the [unclear]. They are like donkeys.

So, but now [unclear] Sahaja Yoga, that the young have the will power. Let them rise and look after. And they mature in the right way. And the old people have matured in the wrong way already. But out of the hard-boiled eggs, are created chickens.
[Laughter]
So the chicks are, now you are the chicks and have that young attitude. You must have young attitude. Otherwise, you see, you’ll pull them down, at least.
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, we are very traditional but we are not orthodox. It’s discretion.
Because orthodoxy is the same thing what I call the hard-boiled stuff.

Now supposing, you try to give Self-Realisation to Khomeini. You could the - [unclear] knows everything about God.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Imagine, it's not only mountain, it's the Malek [unsure] that you cross there.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: It’s better to go to Gobi desert
Sahaja Yogi: Gobi desert.
Shri Mataji: It’s better to go to Gobi desert than to give Realisation to Khomeini.

One has to learn from a person like Warrick. What he does is he keeps all the accounts, keep people come and asking for advice to do their [unclear]. But he never speaks and interferes, whatever they are saying is perfect [unsure]. And that's how it works out, because there are two extremes in Switzerland.
