Talk to Swiss Sahaja Yogis, have "Matriotism", February the 13th, 1984, Bordi, India

Shri Mataji: As you had difficulties with the people who are very materialistic in Zurich, and in Lausanne with old people. So, you all should understand what difficulties Sahaja Yoga has because of such conditions. Materialism is too much in Switzerland. And it’s a [unclear], it’s a treachery, [unclear].

They have extracted all the money from all the countries, illegal stuff [unsure] to put it in their bank. And that’s how they have become rich, you see. And the result of that, the young people are committing suicide. Because the country has to pay for its sins.

Because of Switzerland, we have had problems in all the developing countries. Most of the poverty [unclear] in India is much more, is because of Swiss banks. All the money that come from other banks, as a help, goes to Swiss banks. And it corrupts anything. It corrupts any [unclear] into the [unclear] it has come from. So, people are so poor and starving despite the World Bank is helping, the world is helping. Instead of that, there are three very large organisations that are helping. Thus nothing goes to [unclear].

And the people say, at least all them that are trying to remember in the place of my forefathers, the wage of a woman is four rupees in a week. And of a man, it is eight rupees. Even if they have one child, that child survives, the parents are dying. They have no shoes; they have no proper cloth. They have nothing.

I, of course, blame our politicians also but because they are coming from poorer classes, not so much is done. This Swiss bank is [unclear] really to help them. So those people who indulge in such criminal acts and of such universal nature, or have to very arrogant or they have to shut their heads, because their minds there. Otherwise, if they see they cannot bear it. Otherwise, they’ll commit suicide.
So, how much sin there is on the [unclear], on the [unclear]? And this is the older generation. And the whole thing started by Masonic Lodge. And if you want to read about Masonic Lodge, I have a book on this History of Blake and he has described them as, really like devils, Masonic Lodge.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: This comes out [unclear].
Arnaud: They have links with the Vatican and the Catholic Church.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. They have the Vatican. So, all this comes from the older generation. Not that they don’t know about it. They all know, all the old people know that they are doing these filthy things. But they have covered their hearts with their ego and they are just like stones. They are like Hitler. They are Hitlers.

But Hitler was only for Germany. But this is a universal problem. But what to do now? Either we change our people here entirely and work it out, so that they discard the Swiss bank. But it's a very, very big and deep problem, you see, that the people [unclear] another style.
Now, another thing is that old people take time to change. That's why we can’t change them very easily. The conditioning is so much and they are so much more conditioned than young and their will power is already dying. Like you see, John we had, in our house, the one, I forgot his name.
Sahaja Yogi: John Watkinson.
Shri Mataji: John Watkinson.
He is a [unclear]. He is a [unclear]. John Watkinson. You see, he started to take drugs. And he [unclear]. And then he came to Sahaja Yoga with his parents. They have my photograph, they do puja, they do everything, but they can’t get over their drug habits.
They got into accident thrice, you see, but they said, "Mother, save us". They got hurt but they said, "Mother, save us". And that's the trouble, if they can't get out, they cannot enjoy their life. And as a result of that, Watkinson feels the left side. Though he is all right, but still, the left side is so powerful that it’s impossible even for him to enjoy.

So, in Sahaja Yoga, those who come, unless and until they believe that they are really born twice, and that they have a will power within them, they have to raise their will power and try to remain with the young, you see. And try to understand that younger people have more will power. And not to put the will of the old people on the young people because that's the only way they can exist. Otherwise- because they are lost now, in slavery [unsure]. It’s like your Mother. There is no other way out.

You know what, this is the reason why they all try to be young, in the West. They try to compete with men who are young by even doing the dances which are so difficult for old people. To be the cheer [unsure], old man, he is shaking. He's already shaking. He's already doing shake, what he can do? Horrible.
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s the other way round, you see. The young can move very fast in Sahaja Yoga, and the old sticking on to them, can move also fast.

Now here in India, we give you the example of, say, Warrick [unsure]. He must be about 70 something, I don’t know.
Sahaja Yogi: He is 76, Mother.
Shri Mataji: He is 76. But he such a friend of all the young, you see. He is such a moving force because he is just like a child. And the - the [unclear] it’s really childhood. Because eyesight is [new?], your teeth come back, it’s another childhood. And if somebody wants to accept it, it is that youngness within yourself. You can be young with the younger and think like them. Otherwise, it’s very lethargic.

And the young people, you see, have another problem that they are maybe funfooler [jokers]. I mean they try all nonsense, you see. Like getting nude in that Swiss sea [unsure]. I mean nobody can be believe in Switzerland, you are also nude, as it’s so cold. [Laughter]
I mean, it’s stupidity, absolute stupidity. Absolutely, I mean, like I call them the [unclear]. They are like donkeys.

So, but now [unclear] Sahaja Yoga, that the young have the will power. Let them rise and look after. And they mature in the right way. And the old people have matured in the wrong way already. But out of the hard-boiled eggs, are created chickens.
[Laughter]
So the chicks are, now you are the chicks and have that young attitude. You must have young attitude. Otherwise, you see, you’ll pull them down, at least.
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, we are very traditional but we are not orthodox. It’s discretion.
Because orthodoxy is the same thing what I call the hard-boiled stuff.

Now supposing, you try to give Self-Realisation to Khomeini. You could the - [unclear] knows everything about God.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Imagine, it's not only mountain, it's the Malek [unsure] that you cross there.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: It’s better to go to Gobi desert
Sahaja Yogi: Gobi desert.
Shri Mataji: It’s better to go to Gobi desert than to give Realisation to Khomeini.

One has to learn from a person like Warrick. What he does is he keeps all the accounts, keep people come and asking for advice to do their [unclear]. But he never speaks and interferes, whatever they are saying is perfect [unsure]. And that's how it work should out, because there are two extremes now in Switzerland.

And if the old people who are Realized have to show a way to the old, the hard-boiled, so the people who are- of course, they became younger, much younger after coming to Sahaja Yoga, that they should behave young. There’s one thing I find, why I used to think that they don't like each other, why that? [Unsure]. The reason is you don't know your Mother. If you know your Mother very well, if you know it's one Mother who has given you the [unclear] , if you love Me, you love each other. And perhaps that is the reason why children, my children don't love each other as they should, because they are not in unison.

If you, say, for example, people who do mother [unsure] their country, they’ll never be in fear.
Arnaud: About fears?
Shri Mataji: About fear. You see those, then you feel proud about it, "That’s my Mother! That's my Mother!" Everybody has the same feeling. They talk about the motherhood, mother land that's all we talk that, "Our motherland is so great, this, that".
Now English people you ask them, even they are little [unclear] for their country, they know very little about [unclear]. They are very [unclear] you see, because it is [unclear] style. Every bit of that they know this is the style, this is the thing, and they're so proud of it that they love each other. This is the fun.
Sahaja Yogini: We learnt it in India, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You see?
Sahaja Yogini: The collectivity was so strong [unclear] big fear.
Shri Mataji: You see, that is what it is. If you love Me and if you know Me, you will definitely be one. Because you will so proud of having a Mother like this, all of you will talk about Mother. But we talk about other things, you see, not about the Mother.
Arnaud: [Starts in French]
Shri Mataji: If you talk about the greatness of your Mother, of your love and affection, then you will have no fear.

And this is what Adi Shankaracharya has told you. Adi Shankaracharya has told you that you have to just talk about your Mother, that’s all.
So, like patriotism, if you have patriotism, you can say that it is ‘matriotism’.
[Laughter]

Arnaud: ‘Matriotism’, beautiful.
Another Sahaja Yogi: ‘Matriotism’.
Arnaud: Yes, beautiful word.

Shri Mataji: You see, I am the matrix. And the matrix in you, are the results [unsure]. You see, your matrix, your Kundalini is the matrix, that is a result [unsure]. That’s all your job, your style, your way is higher than anybody else. So you are the matrix. Matrix of the compassion, the love, to feel intense. You see, this is a very different attitude all together. You must know, you are now, you are living by your matrix and not by anything else, not by the mental.

[Arnaud translates]
Shri Mataji: The enjoyment of sacrificing, the enjoyment of bearing up.

I will tell you one story and then you’ll remember. Now if you remember this, that what I want that the young people should take the lead, they should do everything. And the old people should bless it and not to interfere with them. Don't give too much advice. That's the best way to do it and you’ll help them a lot. All right?
Now one story I will tell you. A very nice story, a Marathi story. It’s a very nice story, long time back. It's a very sweet story.
Sahaja Yogi: Can we translate that last part [unclear] Mother.

So, now the story is like this, that there was one boy, his name was Dina. And he had a mother, and he should go to school to learn mathematics. So, then his mother would tell him what to do that, "You take my blouses to the tailor. He has to stitch the patron on that. And then you have to go and get some things, vegetables from the market or anything". He started writing down how much work I do for my mother. And he used to list charges, so many charges for this, so many charges for that. 2 annas for bringing vegetables. 2 annas for taking-
[Unclear]
And he wrote a letter to the mother and put it under her pillow, hoping that she would read the letter and ask for [unclear].

So she was Indian mother, you see. So, Indian mother is a real matrix. She is not like your mothers that you have had, sort of, who always expect some in return of demand, demand you a personal [unclear]. Indian mothers are different.
So, after two, three days, she wrote a letter. And she wrote that, "I bore you in my womb for 9 months. No charge".
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogini: There is a song in French.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: There is a song in French about this story.
Shri Mataji: Like that.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Now she says that, "I gave you milk, you see, as nursery [Arnaud speaks at the same time] No charge. And when you were sick, I looked after you day in, day out. No charge". Like that she made a big list and at the end she said, "No charge. Total, no charge".

He felt a bit sad at it. He just [unclear] He just blessed her and he [unclear] the love.
Arnaud: It is that between the Sahaja Yogis and the Mother, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Something like that, all right? [unclear] not bother [unclear].
And he went back to the mother, embraced her and just covered her with his love and he slept with her. That’s what it is.
Sahaja Yogini: There is a very nice song in French, exactly about this story Mother. Exactly. It is on a record, what you said now. It is on a - somebody is singing it, in French.
Shri Mataji: He must have gone [unclear] from India.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, because it is exactly what you said. And I used to have [unclear].
Shri Mataji: That’s it. Cause the mothers are the worse in [unclear]
Arnaud: The mothers, Shri Mataji, you know that.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: You see, they are uneducated women and they have a [unclear] and they try to dominate too much. Ba, ba, ba! And if they cannot dominate, then they go into sort of a intrigue. They are intriguers. [Unclear] in their mind.
Arnaud: They go up to black magic and-
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. [Unclear]. They are dominating any woman.

So that's what I have to you.
Arnaud: Yes, Shri Mataji, all your blessings and your attention will put it in action, so that next time you come to Switzerland, please Shri Mataji, I hope that everything will work out.
Shri Mataji: All right. So, I told you that you can have that house, you stay there, settle down. And once you start growing well, then you get the other house. Everything happens in the same way.
Arnaud: Yes, Shri Mataji.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: And you can take the one of the copies of the school that they have started Sahaja Yoga. You should say, "It’s an accepted school in India", and you really can write about the hight court judges [unsure]. We are told that are many high Judges [unsure].
Arnaud: To whom should I send it to, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: To [unclear], you see. And when we went to India and see. Now this place, you see, when I occupied it, some people had already occupied the, another room. They came here. They found out and they said that, "We were staying with Mataji Nirmala Devi [unclear].
Arnaud: Yes, there are plenty in India, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All the great political leaders, have written about India [unsure]. So we have seen it. Nobody does to any minister or any other [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: You can't even get one politician into Sahaja Yoga, anywhere in the world. Let’s leave the politician, never have a chief minister [unsure].
Sahaja Yogini: What can I say? Most of them are crazy you know.
Shri Mataji: Crazy people [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Even businessman, how many tough businessmen do you get now?
Shri Mataji: We had about 20 of the [unclear]. They are tools.

The other day, [unclear]. In Pune now-
Sahaja Yogi: In Gujarat, there are many there.
The other day, [unclear]. In Pune, in the night, there are 20 people who were commanders in chief.
Sahaja Yogi: Of the army?
Shri Mataji: Of the army.
Arnaud: Really?
Shri Mataji: And there are chiefs.
Sahaja Yogi: I didn’t know.
Shri Mataji: Yes, in my college, he made a [unclear]. He's the doctor there. He [unclear].
Arnaud: And he came to your program?
Shri Mataji: Of course, I mean even- and not only to my program, but he was student with me in the college and he knew I was a [unclear] and all that. I said, "Now, you are spiritual, you’d better [unclear] ". Absolutely surrendered.
Arnaud: This is amazing Shri Mataji. And this is a horrible stuff in Switzerland, this army business.
[Laughter]
It goes on with the bank, it is a mafia going on.
Shri Mataji: It’s mafia. That’s it.
Arnaud: They support each other.
Shri Mataji: They are very sophisticate there [unclear] style.
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, do you know story of Gregoire? Did he talk about ? as far as this mountain is concerned Ponce Pilat? This Pilat the one who wash the one who washed the hands before Christ and maybe was-
Shri Mataji: He must be Swiss.
Arnaud: Yes. Because there is a mountain called Pilat and the character of the Swiss are exactly fitted to this Ponce Pilat. Because you know the red the Red Cross, we wash our hands. We don't want to interfere we have no problems politically. We don't want to have problems but let the money come in. You see this is-
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].
Arnaud: Yes this is Ponce Pilat. So we have to break it Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: It’s like our Bishop of Canterbury, you see. I saw his interview. He’s so stupid, that they ask him, "What about Holy Ghost?" So he said, "I don't believe in all that".
Sahaja Yogi: "I'm agnostic"
Shri Mataji: "I'm agnostic". So the other fellow asked him, "Then, why are you here? What are you doing?" "I'm doing my job as a bishop".
[Laughter]

So, [unclear]. Politically not interested, money-wise [unclear].
Arnaud: All the time.
Shri Mataji: That’s what it is.
Arnaud: Shri Mataji just to pray to you-
Shri Mataji: Who gave Me this. I wanted to know, from Swiss. Hum? This is some [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].
Arnaud: Shri Mataji just to pray to you [Unclear].
I don’t know. All right, thank you very much. Otherwise -
Arnaud: Shri Mataji, we pray to you that we’re are able to strengthen the collectivity in this country, and give your blessings that it will grow well. So that when you come next year.
Shri Mataji: No, this year.
Arnaud: This year,
[Laughter] You're welcome and your stay will be better than this year.

Shri Mataji: Yes, Ah! By the way, coming to the, those points of saris, did you ask for a sari? Or something, we already bought it.
Arnaud: We paid, we paid.
Shri Mataji: All right. How many of you ask for?
Sahaja Yogi: Do you mean extra saris?
Shri Mataji: Switzerland.
Arnaud: Switzerland. I paid the money to Mr Pradhan.
Shri Mataji: How, who are the others?
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] for a particular puja.
Shri Mataji: No, it is for the- not for the general puja.
Sahaja Yogi: That's what I'm saying. I think he's only purchased the one for the particular, in Switzerland puja.
Shri Mataji: In Switzerland? No, no, no, no.
Arnaud: We paid for the seven main pujas in Europe and for Switzerland.
Shri Mataji: And who has paid four of them? Who are the other four? Who paid for four saris.
Arnaud: I really don't know Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi: Nicolas had paid for them.
Arnaud: We paid we paid for the seven saris.
Shri Mataji: That's apart from that. There are four extras. One is yours, now I know, who else?
Sahaja Yogi: One must be England Shri Mataji.
Arnaud: Ah! One is Austria I'm not sure.
Shri Mataji: These are paid, must have paid. Who else? Have you got in France?
Arnaud: France, I don't know. I don't think they have paid, but I'm not sure, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All right. So I let it here, because we bought four more. You see, [unclear] then inside.

So, if you have paid for that, I'll give you the saris to you people, so that you carry them. Because it is rather difficult for Me to carry all the saris and to [unclear] later on.
Sahaja Yogi: If there’s any spare, we'll take one to Australia.
Shri Mataji: No spare, you see.
Sahaja Yogi: They will understand, Mother. [unsure]
Shri Mataji: They have already ordered. But I'm not coming for three days, this time.
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, make sure.
Shri Mataji: So, it’s all right.

So seven are bought. Did you pay 7,000 for the international one? Have you paid it? No. Sahaja Yogi: Not yet. We’ll pay to [unclear].
Shri Mataji: No, not to [unclear] to [unclear]. All right.
There are, you see, [unclear] to be paid.
Sahaja Yogi: For these seven pujas.
Shri Mataji: For these, you’ll be [unclear], because this is out of the continent. Every puja you have to pay only 11 rupees, and the 10 more paid for these seven, all right? Now for the other seven, that is the international ones, for the international ones, there are seven.
Sahaja Yogi: Like Ganesha.
Shri Mataji: Yes, all of them are international.
[Unclear]
Sahaja Yogi: It's still being held by James for giving pounds [unsure].
Shri Mataji: So that is seven pounds, about. I don't know how much exactly, sorry for that [unsure]. And for these people you have paid how much?
Arnaud: I paid 800.
Shri Mataji: 800.
Arnaud: Now for Mr Pradhan, I paid 800.
Shri Mataji: All right, 800. So, 800 rupees.
[Unclear]
800, you game him. 800 into 4, that is 32,000. All right? If somebody has paid this money, he told me. So, 32,000 for individuals.
Sahaja Yogi: 3,200.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s all right because [unclear] so I adjust it to time [unclear].
Now what is it? You have Switzerland. Now who else?
Arnaud: I think Gregoire is coming much later than me.
Shri Mataji: We’ll find out.
Arnaud: But I'm not sure I can give you the date, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All right so four saris. One in Switzerland, all right?
[Unclear]
Arnaud: I was the first to pay because
Shri Mataji: All right, so four more have been bought, because she told me that they can-
Sahaja Yogi: I'll find out, Mother. I’ll find out.
Shri Mataji: You find out. So these four saris, extra, and seven saris for them. So that one is with James. You have to see [unclear]. And these four saris, she already got. [Unclear] has got all these together.
Sahaja Yogi: We will get the set of the seven and we'll do that.
[Unclear]
Shri Mataji: So, you give 7,000 all together and we’ll adjust it, you see, because some of the saris, some are less, some are more, like that we’ll adjust these 7000. And this one, you’ll pay it 800. So, we will adjust 800, 600, and 700, like that.

[Cut in the audio]
... Like "Oh!". And this is, we don't know what's happening, if somebody felt on the ground and so nothing is coming up. And you don't know what to say, because you can't see anything. And you just can't drive, because as soon as you put the clash, or the brake, it makes such a hard sound. I said, "All right". Because just at that time, when it started, people that are coming are very much argumentative about this money payment. I’ve said, "You can't charge them for 5 days, you have to charge them only for the day when they are there. You cannot charge them for food that they did not eat. You can’t charge them". They’re arguing, arguing with Me. So, the car started.
[Laughter]

And the car stopped, you see. Now pour [unclear], you see, he became very sad that I have to go in a rickshaw. There was a rickshaw there.
Arnaud: A rickshaw?
Shri Mataji: A rickshaw. I got on, on top of Me was [unclear]. She was getting very nervous. She wanted to jump out every [unclear]. So, I said, "All right now you go ahead. You take it to the station, and get it to [unclear]. And we are going now by this rikshaw". About 10 km per rikshaw.
So suddenly, you see, they went back and they went about, hardly about 200 yards and a guy stopped their car for a lift. And they stopped, and doing a song [unsure] all night. I was surprised, you see. They went ahead a little, cause it was [unsure] so nice. So they turned round like this.
Just before, when they were getting in the car, you see, he felt very bad. And [name unclear], said, "Mother, why it has happened?" I said, "You see, because of brahmin, the way he is negative. Give him a bandhan. Everything will be all right". [Unclear] they gave him a bandhan and got into the car.
And then about, after 2 or 3 minutes, they were behind us, hoping that-
Arnaud: No, no.

Shri Mataji: And we just came directly. Nothing had happened to the car.
[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a big mistake, you see.
Shri Mataji: It was a joke!
Arnaud: The car was just your help at this moment.
Shri Mataji [laughing]: It’s such a miracle!
Arnaud: All the tricks, all the tricks.
Shri Mataji: You have to play otherwise, this [unclear] will stop you all the time. Then he started [unclear] this, that. And [unclear], "You should have [unclear] entirely, why did you? [Laughter]"
36:25
And I just said, "It is Me who started fight you see".[Unclear]. Everything is there.
36:29
It’s so simple. [Unclear]. He was so much involved in our personal problems, you see. It’s all nonsense. We have done all this. Before marriage, [unclear] children".
[Unclear part].
36:54
Yes. All right, good. May God bless you.

Now you’re all right, Martine? Is Martine also?
Now I have to tell you about Martine. Also that Martine should understand that there's no romance. Indian men don't know what romance is. It’s your idea. It’s French ideas. You see, you are doing romance and have no love at all.
You see, I don't think you are much attentive, [give much] attention for her. [Unclear]. Here the situation is different, and she should understand that this romance business and this ego business is nonsense. It doesn't exist. It's just your idea and it hurts your ego so you start crying and all that. If you detach, you’re out of reach. You see?
So, something good will come out of it. And one must be thankful to God. And whatever is happening is good.

Another thing, I must tell you about Brigit, because Brigit also has a problem. And the problem of Brigit is that, whatever is done to her, she just says that, "Mother, you’ve done so much, so much and all that". But I [unclear] it comes from her heart, because her ego is sometimes too much. She's a right-sided person. Put her to the left. She's very right sided, don't use any lights for her. Her children are right-sided, she's right-sided. She must sit in the water, she must sit on the Mother Earth. Put the right hand towards the photograph, left hand out to the sky. She should sit in the open sky and see that her right side is clear. She’s too much right-sided and that's why the problems come.

Sahaja Yogi: You said, "Put her to the left", Mother you probably mean left to the right.
Shri Mataji: Left to the right. Raise from left to the right.
Arnaud: Left to the right.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. It’s just the other way round, you see. Always remember that if you have to clear, right hand towards the photograph, and you have to-
Arnaud: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. Left rise and the right side, you have to fill it up with the left.
Arnaud: Left to the right.
Shri Mataji: Yes. [Unclear]. And she has to say that, "Mother you are the real ego. You are the great ego , the Mahat Ahankara. That's the mantra for all those people. And then they say 108 times for seven days, then ego will be suppressed [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: The great mantra. And Chandrama if you get heat.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Internal.
Arnaud: Chandrama.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Chandrama means-
Arnaud: Chandra, the Moon.
Sahaja Yogi: It cools you down.

Shri Mataji: All right now. Is it all right?

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, [unclear] has come to give you that.
[Unclear part].
Shri Mataji: May God bless him.
But I’ll be calling you a bit later, about a year, [unclear]. I’ve done the school. And school can be [unclear]. But I would like you to meet, to see Gregoire.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: They have already read that.
Shri Mataji: They have seen it.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: And have they seen the picture of the school?
Indian Sahaja Yogi: That you can’t get.
Shri Mataji: [Conversation in Hindi].

They have got it? What do they want to discuss with you then? They have pictures, everything.
Sahaja Yogi: Drawing the plan.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: No, no. The drawing of how the school will look, they have to make that one.
Shri Mataji: That I’ve seen, I’ve said.
Sahaja Yogi: It's an impression which is already done.
Shri Mataji: We have seen it.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: Oh! That is done.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Indian Sahaja Yogi: And give it to Bombay, they haven’t got it yet.

Shri Mataji: Then we’ll see, otherwise, [unclear].
[Conversation in Hindi].

All right. May God bless you.
[Cut in the audio].

And now dedicate, dedicate, dedicate.
[Laughter]
So, something like that, [unclear].

Put your right towards Me, that’s all. All the time. You are all right. But still, you have to understand what I'm saying. You have to put left to the right, so you get your- what's you call- left to the right thing, so you get your-
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: Now those who have paid for my cream, please let you know how much-
Sahaja Yogini: No, no. May I send to thy-
Shri Mataji: You always send so much, you already sent me, this one.
Sahaja Yogini: No, but I have some other with me, Shri Mataji. That’s it. I did not send to-
Shri Mataji: But I would like to pay for these.
Sahaja Yogini: No, please, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: How much you paid?
Sahaja Yogini: No, no. I don’t remember.
[Laughter]
And Madhuri will take some for you. [Unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Madhuri is not, it’s Nima.
