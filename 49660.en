Talk to Swiss Sahaja Yogis, February, 13, 1984, Bordi, India

Shri Mataji: As you had difficulties with the people who are very materialistic in Zurich, and in Lausanne with old people. So, you all should understand what difficulties Sahaja Yoga has because of such conditions. Materialism is too much in Switzerland. And it’s a [unclear], it’s a treachery, [unclear].

They have extracted all the money from all the countries, illegal stuff [unsure] to put it in their bank. And that’s how they have become rich, you see. And the result of that, the young people are committing suicide. Because the country has to pay for its sins.

Because of Switzerland, we have had problems in all the developing countries. Most of the poverty [unclear] in India is much more, is because of Swiss banks. All the money that come from other banks, as a help, goes to Swiss banks. And it corrupts anything. It corrupts any [unclear] into the [unclear] it has come from. So, people are so poor and starving despite the World Bank is helping, the world is helping. Instead of that, there are three very large organisations that are helping. Thus nothing goes to [unclear].

And the people say, at least all them that are trying to remember in the place of my forefathers, the wage of a woman is four rupees in a week. And of a man, it is eight rupees. Even if they have one child, that child survives, the parents are dying. They have no shoes; they have no proper cloth. They have nothing.

I, of course, blame our politicians also but because they are coming from poorer classes, not so much is done. This Swiss bank is [unclear] really to help them. So those people who indulge in such criminal acts and of such universal nature, or have to very arrogant or they have to shut their heads, because their minds there. Otherwise, if they see they cannot bear it. Otherwise, they’ll commit suicide.
So, how much sin there is on the [unclear], on the [unclear]? And this is the older generation. And the whole thing started by Masonic Lodge. And if you want to read about Masonic Lodge, I have a book on this History of Blake and he has described them as, really like devils, Masonic Lodge.
Arnaud: Yes.
Shri Mataji: This comes out [unclear].
Arnaud: They have links with the Vatican and the Catholic Church.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. They have the Vatican. So, all this comes from the older generation. Not that they don’t know about it. They all know, all the old people know that they are doing these filthy things. But they have covered their hearts with their ego and they are just like stones. They are like Hitler. They are Hitlers.

But Hitler was only for Germany. But this is a universal problem. But what to do now? Either we change our people here entirely and work it out, so that they discard the Swiss bank. But it's a very, very big and deep problem, you see, that the people [unclear] another style.
Now, another thing is that old people take time to change. That's why we can’t change them [unclear]. The conditioning is so much and they are so much more conditioned than young and their will power is already dead [unsure]. Like you see, John we had in our house the one I forgot-
Sahaja Yogi: John Watkinson.
Shri Mataji: John Watkinson.
He is a [unclear]. He is a [unclear]. John Watkinson. You see, he started to take drugs. And he [unclear]. And then he came to Sahaja Yoga with his parents. They have my photograph, they do puja, they do everything, but they can’t get over their drug habits.
They got into accident thrice, you see, but they said, "Mother, save us". They got hurt but they said, "Mother, save us". And that's the trouble, if they can't get out, they cannot enjoy their life. And as a result of that, Watkinson feels the left side. Though he is right, but still the left side is so powerful that it’s impossible even for him to enjoy.
