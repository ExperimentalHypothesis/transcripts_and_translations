1983-0527: Talk to New People after Meeting, Brighton, England

[This section comes from the audio sent by Derek Ferguson from the UK.]Shri Mataji: Hello! Freedom of the world, isn’t? I told you it is more like it. A lot of people did not come today.Sahaja Yogi: ... and she is from Rottingdean along the coast [a little way]Shri Mataji: Is it? How far?Sahaja Yogi: A couple of miles,Shri Mataji: That’s all?Sahaja Yogi: That’s allShri Mataji: Did you feel anything yesterday?Lady: Not very much.Shri Mataji: Not very much, all right.

[AUDIO 2 STARTS HERE]Shri Mataji: How are you?Lady: Very well.Shri Mataji: Now, all right. Did you say it thirty-two times?[Laughter][AUDIO 1 STARTS HERE]Shri Mataji: It should be sixty-four.You see, it is a reaction. You see, it is a very funny thing, but when we smoke, you see, we feel guilty as well with it always, because we are doing wrong to ourselves.

And that guilt builds up again. So, again you’ll smoke; again that guilt builds up. So, it goes on building up, you see. But you'll give up, no time; it takes little time. I’ve seen if the young people [let’s/ like], say, him or someone who gets realization, they drop all their habits overnight, absolutely overnight, but for older people because the habit is now gone too much in the system and also the willpower is little bit [less], so they take little time. But it works out. So don’t you worry and don’t feel guilty about it.

Seeker: No, well, I know it isn’t good for me. You see, I've always known it wasn't good for me.

Shri Mataji: I know, I know, but doesn’t matter.

Seeker: I try to build the system, You know? [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Yeh.

Seeker: And I have reduced the cigarettes a lot.

Shri Mataji: You will, you will reduce completely. It will happen. But don’t feel guilty, because it's a vicious circle.

Seeker: I know...

Shri Mataji: You see, you will feel guilty and then you smoke. If you don’t feel guilty, you will not smoke. It’s a vicious circle; I'm just saying that. So you go on saying sixty-four times, “I am not guilty.”

Seeker: All right.

Shri Mataji: It's a very vicious circle; I know that. And [there is] for Aids [GW: AIDS or aids?]. It is a problem, you know. We had one John, with us. He's still there in Scotland; he's there, and he had his parents. And he learnt all these things, smoking of these dopes and things like that and drugs and all that. So after realization, next day he dropped everything, one hundred percent just dropped it, you see. But these parents are still lingering, you see, still trying to get out of it. They got out of most of them. But still they’re they're hanging on to one thing there.

And they feel very guilty and then they feel guilty. They have, of course, all respect for Me, and there was an accident and they were all saved from that. They said, “It’s Mother who has helped.” Everything is there, everything, but that, this willpower that to leave that last part of it is still there, and they little feel guilty. So I said, “There's nothing to feel guilty. You just come along and see. There is nothing to feel guilty. Only by seeing Me you will get over these habits,” and that’s how it's working out. So [that’s] nothing; nothing to feel guilty. That’s one thing is definite: you'll just drop it. And even some young people, one or two [can] carry on, like this one in Lille. What’s her name, hm?

Yogi: Cathy, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Cathy, now she's all right. She's given up, or she's still?

Yogi: I don’t know, maybe, maybe [maybe/the baby] Mother, since she [has got] the baby...

Shri Mataji: Eh! That’s how they sent Me a telegram about the baby. She said the name and all that. But I think with the baby it will stop completely. But she had stopped quite a lot. And she was so nervous about it; you know, in My presence she used to shake, and I said “I [know] it’s all right. I know you smoke. It’s all right. I mean, it's not such a sin.”

Yogi: Mother, it was Brian who gave up overnight.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Seeker: Brian from Australia; he used to smoke eighty a day.

Shri Mataji: Which Brian.

Yogi: Brian Bell, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: And yes, he was telling, he smokes eighty a day. And then when he got his realization from You, then he had a cigarette and he found he didn’t like it.

Shri Mataji: That’s what happens.

Yogi: [he threw the packet away and that was it /And stopped it right away; that’s it.]

Shri Mataji: Yes, it has happened with many like that, with many people, you see? I mean, you get rid of so many things. Like he had hayfever, his continuous hayfever business. I mean, I’d never seen him without hayfever, and one day he just gave it up, you see? He gave up the hayfever.

Hmm. So now, who, who else is the new person here?

Yogi: Fergy.

Shri Mataji: Come forward, come. All right [please/just/you] sit down. We’ll see that. No, let’s work on her; just put your hands like this. Now you see, when you come to the center, these people will tell you more about it, what is to be done, how to get rid of things, [and] whatever has to be got rid of, should be got rid of. One should not feel identified you know, about anything. Even people get identified with small things, you see? Like a necklace now, for example; if the necklace which is not giving good vibrations or is for the time being requires a little treatment, then we should try to remove the necklace. If they say, “Put it in the water,” you should not feel bad. If supposing, “It's given by my mother and all that,” is not proper because even if it is given by your mother it must be cleansed, you see. So anything that is told is for your good, and as you would listen to a doctor for your treatment, you must listen to them, and not to feel bad or unhappy. If you start feeling unhappy about it, or bad about it, then you will drop out.

You see, this is what it is; slowly and steadily. They should be also very kind and gentle because they know what they were themselves, all of them, and from where they have come and what they had. They all had problems and they came out of it. So they also should remember that these are the people, they are coming for the first time, and the cleansing has to be done and with a gentle way because nobody should feel hurt about it, any cleansing. It should be...

If you are very deft and an artist, you can do it in a way that the person doesn’t feel hurt. Sweetly and nicely, you must explain to them that this should be given up. And it should be done in a way that that doesn’t hurt your ego in any way, and your identifications must drop [off/ out]. But is a, is an art how to slowly bring people to that understanding; you see, it is an art. And what should be worked out this way, that it should become a longing for people to do that. And one can work it out.

She's all right now. I'm happy.

Now, I missed you yesterday.

Man: I'm sorry.

Shri Mataji: All right, let’s have your hands like that, and it takes nothing to say some kind words, you see. [She repeated twice: “to”] to all of them. If they are catching or if there is any problem, it’s not that we want to do it. It’s there. So one has to be very, very kind and gentle with them.

Haan! Hmm! better, hmm., better. Now see, his vibrations. I think you should sit little separately from him, all right? And from anybody who has been to TM, you sit separately from them also. I think Jim has been to TM. Who else? Raise your hands who have been to TM. Two hands. All right, so now you make some room for a person where there is no TM person sitting. Come this side. It’s better to come this side, you see. Fergy has not been to TM, I'm sure. Mark, I don’t think you have been to TM.

Mark: No.

Shri Mataji: No, no all that nonsense. Now it’s better. Ah! It’s all right. Hmm! Better now. You feel better; it comes up.

Hmm! Please put your right hand on the Mother Earth like that here. Please tell her to breathe. Hold your breath little bit, thrice, little bit, not much.

Hmm! Hmm! Haan! Better, all right? Just see on his head.

Yogi: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Please close your eyes. Is she all right? On the head, on the head. You see, you can feel it better on the head because all the chakras are there. So immediately you'll know.

Haan! Haan! Left Vishuddhi and left Agnya. So you give it a loop like that. Left; no, this way, anti at the back, and throw it away.

Hmm! Better now, better. She’s there. It should be here. So put your hand on her Vishuddhi.

How is Cambridge?

Yogi: Coming along, Mother, this evening [stage?]

Shri Mataji: Hmm! Next will be Cambridge, I think, after.

Yogi: Would You like to come, Mother?

Shri Mataji: It will be in July sometime. Hmm? June, I have to go to Paris and, eh?

Yogi: Spain.

Shri Mataji: Paris and Spain, and it could be in July I’ll come. Norwich is doing well, I was told.

Yogi: Yes, very well Mother.

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Yogi: Dawn should be there Tuesday.

Shri Mataji: Who, John?

Yogi: Dawnand the baby.

Shri Mataji: Dawn, she's coming.

Seeker: Yes, I think she is coming. So I am not sure.

Shri Mataji: Dawnhas a specialty. She's the one who brought Brighton people to Sahaja Yoga. And now I knew she will bring some people from Norwich. But Cooley; how is he? Still in a temper? Is he all right?

Yogi: He’s great.

Shri Mataji: You see, he, he can't tolerate nonsense. That's the trouble with him. What he says is true; he gets so annoyed with people. But one has to tolerate, to see. That’s another part of Sahaja Yoga: one has to tolerate in the beginning.

Yogi: In the beginning we were very tolerant and after sometime we become less tolerating. We forget how we were.

Shri Mataji: But also the parents of Dawn are funny people, very funny, absurd, absolutely.

Seeker: They don’t speak now.

Shri Mataji: There's no openness of the heart, you see. They’ll put some barriers, some sort of [cynicism and all/a see reserve this] that.

Yogini: Mother, Don’s baby hasn’t been feeling very well, at Agnya. Don said he has a respiratory infection.

Shri Mataji: I knew, I knew this was because, you know, when she came, such a lot of

[flem/phlegm]

came out of her lungs. So I hope she comes with the baby to see Me.

Yogini : She's intending to come Tuesday, Mother.

Shri Mataji: She was very stupid also, looking after the baby, you know. She didn’t know how to look after the baby. The whole thing was filled with phlegm. I took it out. Such a sweet thing she is, the baby is. Such a beauty; real Greek, heh? With the big eyes. That’s what Kulli was afraid of when she was going to have a baby because she is a little clumsy person, and he said that, “My child will be sick.” So I said, “You better learn how to look after the baby.” That as a Greek he can’t do, like Indians, you see? All right, better now.

Haan! What about her? Heart, right. You live there alone? Do you live in your house alone?

Lady: No.

Shri Mataji: You are married?

Lady: Yes.

Shri Mataji: And

[do]

you have children?

Lady: No.

Shri Mataji: When were you married?

Lady: Twelve years ago.

Shri Mataji: You want to have children? What?

Lady: My husband can't have any.

Shri Mataji: Who told you?

Lady: The doctors. He's had a operation [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: Why doesn’t he come to Sahaja Yoga?

Lady: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Heh?

Yogi: He doesn’t like to go anywhere, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Why?

Lady: He likes staying at home.

Shri Mataji: He's developed that complex in his mind. Tell him, “Mother has called you. Must come and see the Mother in the home only. From home to home we can go, all right?” It'd be nice to him. Tell him he must come and see Me. It may not be so; may become fertile. You can't say these days, all right? What does he do?

Lady: He's carpenter.

Shri Mataji: Carpenter. So bring him along sometime to London. Hm? He has got his workshop at home only?

Lady: No.

Shri Mataji: Then?

Lady: He works for an employer.

Shri Mataji: Then he has to go to office in any case, or he has to go to...

Lady: He doesn’t mind that.

Shri Mataji: Then you tell him, he should not be obstinate. It can work out, you see? Why not try? It’s like a doctor. That’s the reason you’ve got this right heart.

Lady: Also, I am worried because I have fits.

Shri Mataji: Hem?

Lady: Also I am worried because I have fits.

Yogi: She's had some epilepsy previously [Mother]. She's had epilepsy.

Shri Mataji: When was this?

Lady: Got epilepsy / I start having fits] about six years ago.

Shri Mataji: And now?

Lady: Well, I take drugs to stop it.

Shri Mataji: All right, now if I advise you one thing, you should listen, all right, that don’t wear anything black, because this epilepsy and all that is worsened with black; you should wear something light-colored clothes. And it is absolutely curable, epilepsy is. There is no problem about it. But you have to bring seven lemons and seven chilies. (To get rid of tm problems)Today can you get it for her?

Yogi: Yes, we are going shopping today.

Shri Mataji: And she should put her left hand towards the photograph and right hand outside with the light. And you must keep lights in your house as far as possible; you must keep light. With the photograph you should have a light. Light is the one that is going to help you, all right?( to get rid of tm problems)Some Yogis talking all together [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: She's all right? Hm?

(Fergy)[I think it is blue/Her fingers are clearing, Mother]. They were blue but they are clearing.

Shri Mataji: They had become blue!

(Fergy) They were blue, yes, but they just become clear.

Shri Mataji: Ah, good, good, good. I never knew why had they so blue! This became, when, when was this?

Lady: Yes, about six years.

Shri Mataji: How many?

Yogi: Six years ago.

Shri Mataji: And how many years you did your TM?

Lady: Six years.

Yogi: About six years, Mother; the same.

Shri Mataji: They go hand in hand, is it? Say Narakasura Mardini. It’s so miraculous, Sahaja Yoga. Done. It's finished; that, too, if you press it.

Yogi: Mother, there is some new people come.

Shri Mataji: All right. May God bless you! Now, you were there yesterday?

Man: No.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see she was there. Yes, I saw. Good, please. What about this lady? How is she? She was all right I [think]. Put her right to the left. Is she all right?

Yogi: She does some healing, Mother.

Another Yogi: She does this absent healing, Mother.

Shri Mataji: So what we can do is to make her stand there for a while. Let her right side, it should be outside and left side inside. Then it will be cleared out. Then I’ll work on her back.

Yogi: Put your left hand towards Shri Mataji, your right hand just upside a little.(facing backwards)

Shri Mataji: Left hand, that would be better. It will be cleared out. It will be cleared out just, yes.

Yogi: I’ll show you.

Shri Mataji: You see, it will pass through left. It will clear out; it will. They'll show you everything, all right? We have to clear you out a little. Is he all right?

Yogi: Feeling Swadishthana and Void, left Swadishthana.

Shri Mataji: Swadishthana. You use light for him. It’s very good. Have you got another candle?

Yogis: Yes, we have more candles.

Shri Mataji: And candle stand or something. Just do it. You see, with all these people you can use left. With her also you can use left, you see? You can put a light for her to put her left, right hand. Need not open the window; it’s all right. You just put a light; it’s all right. Hm! Better now, you see? Put your hand. Are you feeling better? Are you feeling anything in your hand?

Yogi: She says her hands are so warm [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: Both the hands or one hand? You put them to your cheeks; you’ll see.

Yogi: Her face is hot as well.

Shri Mataji: Eh, eh! You’ve been to some spiritualist or someone?

Lady: [I went to a spiritual church for healing]

Yogi: She went to spiritualist church long time ago for healing.

Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s it. That why you have a problem. Now what was the name of the spiritualist church?

Lady: [Unclear]

Yogis: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Patron. Hmm, give her one; will be good idea. She, too. For him also light will be a good idea. What a left Vishuddhi! Baap re. Just see, Sarva Mantra Siddhi. You should say the mantra.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Sarva Mantra Siddhi Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Sarva Mantra Siddhi Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Sarva Mantra Siddhi Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Better. Now say Vishnumaya.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Vishnumaya Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Vishnumaya Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Vishnumaya Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: All right, say it once, I think twice more. Let’s see, six times eight times. If you say you've said three times, five times more you say Vishnumaya.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Vishnumaya Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Vishnumaya Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Om Twameva Sakshat. Shri Vishnumaya Sakshat. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Cleared out. Now just see on his head. He’s got it. He’s got it. It’s very much there; it’s great. Yes, he's got it. Just see it on your head. It’s all right. It's done. It’s done. It's cool. He's gentleman with very moderation type of a person. Hmm! Little further, little here in front, yes, just see [here] [Unclear.] Raise it, raise it. See, little bit on the left he has problems. So what you do is to right, raise the right and bring it to the left. Little bit, not much. He's all right. What do you say? Is she all right?

Yogis: Cleared, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Cleared. What a miracle Sahaja Yoga is, isn’t it? Such a miraculous thing, yah? Now? Haan?

Yogi: Still has left Agnya; it's clearer, though.

Shri Mataji: Mahaganesha Mahabhairava, say.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Mahaganesha Sakshat ,Shri Mahabhairava Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Hmm.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat ,Shri Mahaganesha Sakshat Shri Mahabhairava Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Done. Now on his head, right to the left. Give him something to sit down.

Yogis: Cushion.

Shri Mataji: Some cushions. He’s all right. He’s great. A sensible man and a wise person, you see? Like Kabira said that, “Das Kabir jatan se odhi, Ye chadariya, jaisee ki taisee rakh deenee chadariya”' He says, “This sheet,” ? means this body of mine ? “sheet is created by God, and I used it with very great fear, 'jatan se odhi', and kept it as I got it, didn’t spoil it. 'Jaisee ki taisee rakh denee chadariya'. I kept it the way it was given to me by God. I kept it the same.”

Haan! But that doesn’t mean that you should feel guilty because you are not Kabir, see? Come along. Come along. There's room for you. Is all cleared out, all the blue, everything? Not a trace of it left now? Can you believe it? You had it for six years? Show it to your husband, see? May God bless you!

You see, it happens so quickly that some people told us that we must take photographs of before and after, but the whole thing happens so quickly, there's no time even to adjust your camera. It took five minutes. She had all blue, blue fingers, absolutely blue, for how many years? Six years, and it all disappeared in no time. Now, where is the time to focus the camera?

Better now. It’s better, better. Left is still little bit shaking. Hm, these are the effects of TM. Horrible, horrible; worse thing is TM, I think, sometimes.

There is a girl called Valery, you see, in London. She’s giving a program about these gurus, you see, how they have spoiled people, and there she’s taking interviews and all that, and of course she's got many TM, because there are many TMs who have come. And also we have got Rajneesh people in Belgium. They can come and tell about it, what happened. And it seems that BBC is interested in that, and they tried to make that film. In this, they are trying to show, you see, how these gurus can spoil your being. And also she being a Sahaja Yogini, she wants to say what one should expect, but not Sahaja Yoga. The word she's not using so far, because that may look as if she's trying to support one and degrade others, you see. But it’s all right that way, and that sort of a thing, a play, you see. We can write also a play on those lines, how a seeker who’s born like that with an idea about goodness of the world, and he depends on all these gurus without any suspicion, how he jumps to them, his money, does everything in all complete confidence, you see, and how the media and all other people, like we should say his agents and people who help them, you see, to build up their images, you see.

How they also create a false image of these people and how the seeker without understanding jumps into it and falls a prey. That’s sort of play. It can be very interesting and it can be very amusing also, because some of the things that these gurus tell you, I mean, for any normal person they can see that it's absurd, you see? And we can put in many ways the ideas of Sahaja Yoga in between in there. Like, one can say, for this [Mahesh yogi?] that not his name. We'll not have his name as such, but we'll use some other names and things , but he's going to teach you to say to fly, all right? Then why doesn’t he fly himself, you see? Can he fly himself, and sort of things, you see? So and we can show how people fly exactly, what sort of thing they do and how they jump. And all those things if they are shown to the public, I'm sure, you see, the new people, the new seekers are now seeking, will not go to these nonsensical places. They will go to reality. And that is very important.

Now we have one David Praul who used to – I don’t know, he never wrote, but he was in production of plays like that. And we have Sahaja Yogis who can act, and we can work it out a play like that. But first, such a play must be properly written down, which I hope some people will try to give.

You see, everyone can give a interesting dialogue in that say a part of it, and we can just fill it up. And at least it will stop now stupidity and this kind of befooling that they are doing. This must be stopped now ? it's important ? and also drug, you see? Drug is something so simple to stop. Now, for example, these AIDS and all those new diseases have come up. People are going to stop it. That’s their nature's help, but for these gurus somebody has to talk on that level Otherwise, nobody can understand it, you see. They must see themselves. What’s this? Why are we going to these nonsensical people, about their – the way they give you mantras and all that? And to answer it back, we can have another person or a personality or some sort of a thing that is Sahaja Yoga, in a way, and that shows the light. Say, for they, they say that this is the mantra they gave me secretly, I can't tell you, and mantra turns out to be nothing but what you call is the tail of a scorpion, inga. Inga is nothing but the tail of a – what you call ? a scorpion.

Yogi: Scorpion. House scorpion.

Shri Mataji: The tail, it is the sting, the sting. The sting is attached to the tail, you see? So that tail which is stinging is inga. He's given this mantra to so many. And that’s why he used to giggle, you see, “How I've befooled these people.” He used to giggle. He was called as giggly, because he used to laugh, you know. He used to mock at people. “Look at these people. I've made to fool out of them.” He couldn’t control. And these are the ardent, sincere, earnest seekers of ages, not of today, see, and these horrible satanic forces have taken birth to just to finish all your seeking, which you cannot understand. You are too simple for them. You cannot understand how horrible they are and the way they take money. All these points can be brought in clearly. But we must save now as many as we can. The time has come. As it is, they are little bit doing [unclear].

But they have their own methods. You see, this Rajneesh, there was a very nice film on “The God who ran away”. It was shown by BBC, here, and luckily we have taped it. And in, in Australia two Sahaja Yogis, who are very well-known journalists, they wrote an article against Rajneesh, and a suit was filed against them, and the newspaper people were very much worried, you see ? two million dollars. And they wrote to us that, “This is what has happened, Mother. What to do?” And we sent this film to them, and when we, they saw this film, they withdrew the case, you see. But see the trick: still, they would not give up. They went to BBC and bought that film at a very high price, and now that film cannot be shown publicly. You can even buy falsehood, you can buy poison and that’s what it is. Now they cannot publish it. You cannot show it publicly under law. Just see: the law helping the thugs.

But we have got it. I mean, we can show it to you. But you won’t eat your food for eight days, if you see [it]. It happened to Me. It’s horrible. Horrible, I tell you. It’s such a horrible thing. It’s the hell. I mean, what you have heard of hell, you can see it clearly. But the people who were doing it never felt it, never knew what they were doing. And most of them are now in madhouses somewhere. Nobody is bothered. From TM we know of so many who are in, but one is a very bad case. What was his name who is still in the lunatic asylum?

Yogi: Alan, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Alan, poor thing, and all others are lost. You know, they are just like cabbages. Even if you show them a garlic, they start shivering. And if you take these incense things near them, they start shivering. They can't see the light. They sit in the dark. Their lives are wasted, everything wasted; so much money.

It’s a very serious thing, you know. Now we are not going to be destroyed from outside, you see. We should not worry about Russia. They are already getting destroyed because they are taking to parapsychology. What we should worry, how we are going to be destroyed from inside, you see, cancer, on the physical side. All these diseases were not present about sixty, seventy years back. Now these new diseases are coming up. Then mentally all these gurus can capture you. Negative forces, like even witchcraft or spiritualist, even churches are taking to charismatic. Can you imagine? Churches are taking to charismatic. As they are, they get possessed, because there they are, sitting on the tombs of other people. So they are already possessed.

On top of that, they are doing charismatic. According to them, charismatic movement is Christ movement. Now what to do to such hopeless brains? When did He do such things like “charismatic movement Christ”. One better than the other. Then the Jews, another stupid clan. I don’t know. They want to deny Christ at any cost. All sorts of things are there. Then these fanatics in Iran, they are political fanatics, social fanatics, religious fanatics. I mean, everybody ends up as a fanatic. What sort of a brain people have? They haven't got a way of seeing things. Now if you are a Conservative must you absolutely be a Conservative? Can't you be a little bit of a Labor, and a Labor? Can't you be a little bit of a Conservative? It’s such a fanaticism. Such stupid people, I tell you. All over the world, it’s like that.

In India they are all thugs, I tell you, real thugs in our politics. In Delhi they are, it’s a big gang sitting there, of thugs. It’s all absurd. My brother is also a Cabinet Minister but I told him, “Among these thugs, what are you going to do? As a person you will be thrown away, or you have to become like [them/that]?” All thugs, looting our country openly. And whatever are remaining from politics are coming here as gurus. That is the guidance from India, the great spiritual land, spirituality. I'm so ashamed of these people.

These Rajneesh people; another fad. In London when they started this center, they just hired one big huge basement, horrible-looking, cleaned it up and started this center. You had to pay five pounds to go in that basement, take out your clothes and start dancing with hands up, “Ho, ho, ho, ho”. And imagine these wise Englishmen going into that, paying five pounds, take out their clothes and dance, and not one; in one month nine hundred people started doing it. Can you believe it? And now it is so much, such a great number, that they have occupied most of the basements. Imagine. And yesterday these stupid two people who had come, I told them that, “You shouldn’t wear these things. Why are you wearing?” “He said that, but he talks like You.” I said, “Really?” I mean, they are so mesmerized that I am just anti-him. Openly I'm talking against all these things he's doing, and here they are hearing Me as he's talking. Can you imagine the mesmerism of that quality? How will you get out of it?

Hm. Better now? Put down his sympathetic [unclear]. I think better talk about good things, about God Almighty, Who's so kind, Who's forgiveness. See, I never imagined it will work so fast and so well. He's so great. He's so anxious that this world must be saved. He's doing everything that is under the sun, I tell you. He's so helpful. Except for the human beings, every other element is helpful. Animals are helpful, nature is helpful, all five elements are helpful. I don’t find anything that is not helpful except for human beings. Can you imagine? And that is the epitome of His creation. Sometimes they have too much ego, sometimes they have too much conditioning, and I don’t know how will they get out of it. And it is moving so slowly, you don’t know. We have been to Brighton. Now how many years I've been coming?

Yogi: For four years.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]

Thus seven years at least; I'll see now what is the situation today. They had nine hundred in one month, and in seven years what do we have? What to do now? But first they didn’t want to put the posters and all that. I said, “Baba, do what you like. Advertise Me the way you like, do what. I’ll go to your radio stations; everything I’ll do.” But just see, this is the state of affairs of a human mind, you see. It’s such a slow movement. Think of it. You all should find out ways and methods by which you can spread Sahaja Yoga in Brighton. Really, you must, because Brighton is very, very powerful place, very powerful, I tell you. This I said long, long time back. And you can see from the energy lines how powerful it is. Have you seen the energy lines of Brighton? It’s very interesting to see. Where is that?

Yogi: The book is up in German with all those papers.

Shri Mataji:

[talking aside: Give him some sort of a seat. There must be some
rest.]

Yogi: Cushion or seat? Cushion? Pillow?

Shri Mataji: Now see here, the [Sussex] elephant, they’ve found out here. You see it so clearly. See, the unconscious is helping so much. Where is that drawing of a little elephant and all that?

Ah! Here you see; see now. You see, this is the elephant, little elephant, here at this point. See, this is the elephant at this point here. In Sussex, all right? And this a little dolphin here, and here they had for seminar at this point. Now I don’t know where is this elephant placed.

Yogi: Twenty miles, east from here.

Shri Mataji: Twenty miles east.

Yogi: There is an [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Heh?

Yogi: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: And from Lewes also, Lewes, there is a line passing through sea. And these are all zodiac signs at different points, you see. But now we have to take full advantage of it. That’s the point, is that we must understand the unconscious is helping us, the nature is helping us. The sea is here, so fine. If you don’t now take to it, I don’t know what will happen. The sea is so close. Be careful. One has to be very careful, with the sea there. See, and the way we are insulting sea, we don’t respect. It's your Father. People go and drink there. I mean, the sea is the one against drinking; that’s in the Void. Ocean is in the void, and all of them go and sit there and drink. Just imagine. It’s very much punishable, but so far it’s quiet.

Now you all have to think and find out ways and methods of exploiting ? you may call it exploring ? the brains of the people here, how to how to make them come to Sahaja Yoga, to save them, because destruction is very close, is very close. You have to work very hard, I tell you.

Yogi: We are trying to expose some of these false gurus by getting some accounts of people who think of these gurus, and publicly, what damage they have done.

Shri Mataji: Do you still have false gurus here in your colleges, universities?

Seeker: Yes, we have Divine Light [cross going there, unclear]

Shri Mataji: Divine Light is still there?

Yogi: The Orange people. We are seeing more Orange people now.

Shri Mataji: You can use the film for the Orange people in a private.

Yogi: What?

Shri Mataji: You can, you see, in the private ? public, you need not ? but you can tell some people that we are going to show you a very good film about Rajneesh. Why not get them in a private place and show them that film? Why not do like that?

Yogi: Show us the Orange people?

Shri Mataji: Orange people see what you have been doing? Is it God?

Yogi: We can't get many Orange people come to Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: No, no, not Sahaja Yoga. You can just tell them a private film show arranged, especially for Orange people, all right? And get up some place private.

Yogi: And wear orange.

Shri Mataji: Need not wear, need not, all right. Even if you wear, you are that. So doesn’t matter. It's not you are not professing something wrong. They are. So you just say that for Orange people, especially for Orange people arranged, a private film, you see. Let them see for themselves. [it is a good idea to neutralize that.]

Yogi: But not publicly.

Shri Mataji: No, you can't do that's [against the] law, they say. Because they have bought it, you see.

Yogi: Other gurus maybe.

Shri Mataji: Now which one?

Yogi: Divine Light.

Shri Mataji: Oh, Divine Light. We can give you lot of information about that.

Yogi: And TM.

Shri Mataji: TM, of course, I mean, TM, TM lot of people are here, see? Yes, that we can say publicly. You can also – you see, we have lots of articles written. Linda’s article [or there] must be with someone, eh. [Winston?] you have that article?

Yogini: We’ve got some of it, Mother. Yes, we definitely managed to salvage some of the documents.

Shri Mataji: No, the one she gave in the world news.

Yogini: News of the World.

Shri Mataji: News of the World or something.

Yogini: It must be somewhere.

Shri Mataji: So we can do that.

Yogi: Mother, we can get people to work, to write their own personal accounts about what happened to them and how they have changed since they are in Sahaja Yoga, and to compile a file of all those who have been mesmerized and damaged and put it forward to some public, to some full public publishing.

Shri Mataji: Is it possible?

Yogi: Yes, in Brighton, they say, a socialist newspaper called “Brighton Voice” which we could send an article to.

Shri Mataji: See, he can, he can help you in editing that. So you will know what is to be put there. But put it in a way that it's written underlines, you see everything, the people should know the truth, you see? Carefully, but they should know the truth what is behind it. So, you can take from all these people who are here, and also people in England can give you lots of; we have so many people from TM now. They all can write to you.

Yogini: Ishwara and Dave who come to Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Let them die their own death. Ishwara, let them go. They'll die their own death. You see they are, you see, it’s like a balloon. It has to blast by itself.

Yogini: They said they are higher than Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, you are. You better go higher and higher. Just, just push them up. It’s very good. We accept; it’s higher. Why do you come here to know this? Why don’t you go to... let them blast up. That’s what is going to happen. It’s such an absurd thing. You don’t have to protest against them. You should say, “Oh, very great, you are really higher. Will you please go away from our meetings? Why do you come here? We are not higher people.” That’s how, you see, we must learn how to confront others also. There a tactic for that. For these stupid people who think they are higher, let them feel that way. Sometimes it need happens like that.

Yogi: Mother do we have anything about these Lamas coming over? Do you know anything about these...

Shri Mataji: Where are they coming now? Russians are coming like Lamas? Where are they arriving?

Yogi: This, this, the Buddhism is been influenced something by the Tibet.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I think we can write a book about this very well. I'm trying to gather some information about these things, and see this, My son-in-law is going to help Me with this, who has been to [Unclear]. But what the Buddhist have achieved, we should see what they have achieved.

Yogi: They have a big center in Brighton, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Why not go and talk to them?

Yogi: We did.

Shri Mataji: What did they say?

Yogi: They just laughed at us.

Shri Mataji: They are all laughing Buddhas now. No, but there is a center in England, and the head of that head center had come to our program. He's very anxious I should go and see them in their own place. This girl, what’s her name? Sarah, she’s arranged it. Sarah, no. What’s her name? That very fat one, what's her name?

Yogis: Rita, Mother.

Shri Mataji : Rita. Sorry, Rita, Rita, she, she arranged it, and I didn’t go there that time. I had no time, but I this year I’ll go and see them. The fellow felt the cool breeze. But you see, the Buddhism can be brought round very well because they have so many cults and so many deviations that is not one. That’s one of the things we can always

[put]

, you see. If Christianity is correct, then why do they have so many branches? If Hinduism is all right, why do they have so many paths? It has to be one; if truth is one, it has to be one.

Like they went and asked Mahatma Gandhi, some missionaries, you see, “You believe in Christ, principle of non-violence. Then why don’t you become a Christian?” He said, “I will, but which church should I join?”

Buddhist also, you see, get this Ekadasha Rudra [very badly, they suffer a lot, suffer a lot.] I think we’ll work through that center also. They suffer too much, and the principle they have evolved is that we must suffer [a lot/ if we have to go to]. So suffering is taken like a blessing for them. Gradually, it will work out when they'll suffer too much they'll to such an extent that in America I went, and the journalist had come, as I told you, and he just disappeared and he asked Me about Ramkrishna, and I said he was not a realized soul and, but he said, “He suffered so much.” I said, “Who asked him to suffer? Why should you suffer?” So what he says, “We have a right to suffer.” This is [brainwash/ brainwave], I tell you. I didn’t know what to answer and this, such a stupid thing like that, “We have a right to suffer. Nobody can take this right from us.” American, I must tell you, “Nobody can take this right from us. We have a right to suffer.” So go on then; suffer. And if somebody says that, “We can take away your sufferings and if you give us this suggestion that, ‘No, we have a right. You can't take away our right’.” At least in law you cannot take poison. There are many things you cannot do: you cannot commit suicide; you cannot do so many things. They can say, “We have a right to commit suicide. Who are you?” Maybe, you see, I don’t know, a new law may be passed after sometime. If many people start believing in suicide, they might just come up with an idea that, “Why not we have a right to commit suicide?”

Like in, say, Sweden and Norway, now of course Switzerland is the top most in suicide. Do you know that?

Yogi: I didn’t know that.

Shri Mataji: Now, now it’s surpassed. The greatness of Sweden and Norway is lost now. Now it's Switzerland.

Yogini: The high season is November, when the weather is bad.

Shri Mataji: Really! They do it in November. Horrible! And if you, some people you see, some girls, young girls, they told Me that, “Main thing we do is to plan how to kill ourselves.” That’s all they have to think of all the time. The vibration is so horrid that the fingers were numb. I said, “What do you do?” They said, “Only thing we do is to plan how to commit suicide.” Can you imagine? Young girls of seventeen, eighteen years.

Better now, better. Are you feeling better now?

Yogi: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: That is what, that’s good. Now you just watch Me and see if you can stop your thought while watching Me. Can you watch Me without thinking? There's no thought. Is there is any thought now? Are you thinking?

Yogi: I think of You, nothing more.

Shri Mataji: Nothing. Haan, better. Back Agnya, Agnya at the back. You see, what’s happening, the whole Kundalini is working on the back. Because of the Agnya it is not going through. So he's feeling the heat.

Yogi: The liver?

Shri Mataji: Yes, the liver is there. Health-wise also, he's not all right. But that’s not [the liver/ so difficult]. First of all, the left side should be cleared out.

Yogi: Which sugar You recommended?

Shri Mataji: Hmm! Of course, of course, no doubt. Are you all right now?

Lady: Yes, My head is cooler.

Shri Mataji: Cooler? Good.

Yogi: When they were pulling down the sympathetic, Mother, she felt a lot cool on her head.

Shri Mataji: Good, yes, it works. This is the Yuga of the vibrations working. It's called as Krita Yuga now. The Kali Yuga is over now. Krita Yuga has started. What do you say?

Yogi: Left void [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: He needs lemon and chilies, that’s it, and also you need sugar, all right? Little more treatment is needed, if you don’t mind, haan?

Man: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Better now, it will be but to take it out permanently. You took it up very seriously. Is it TM?

Yogi: No I didn’t ... about two weeks [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: You had this liver trouble before also.

Man: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: No, no I mean you were thin like this before also.

Yogi: I am always thin. My father is thin. My brother is thin. We are all thin.

Shri Mataji: That's it. Yah, see that’s the thing. What do you like in food?

Yogi: Food? Most things.

Yogini: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Fried? What, likes what?

Yogini: He doesn't like sugar.

Shri Mataji: Sugar he should have. He needs it very much in the body. Very much he needs, but not fried things. Not fats that he should not have. You see, that’s one thing he should not have.

Man: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: No, no with sugar you'll rise. You see, because the fat gives too much work to the liver, so we must give some rest to your liver, and the sugar sustains it. Carbohydrates are important for some people. It’s not a general rule that if you don’t take sugar, another person should not take. It’s not such a general rule, you see. Doctors are like that. I shouldn’t say because there are some [people] sitting behind you, but, you see, they are indiscriminate. They don’t discriminate between. There are two types of people. Some have lethargic organs and some are overactive. Now, yours is overactive. So you need something to settle it down, all right? It’s a temperament. Everybody has a different temperament, and accordingly the person should be treated. Actually, our medical science, the present medical science, at the same base, but they changed over somehow, just like [Rabinath/ Wagner], you see? They changed all the roots of music. The doctors changed all the roots, and they started treating the leaves instead of the roots. [All right.]

Are you better now? Now you do also one light for him. I think if he does there it will make, half of it might clear out. Are you better? Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand now? Not yet? All right.

Can you make him stand near that light for a while if he can? Let’s see. Keep it there only and let him stand there. You can come forward. Let him stand there, which is a good idea. It will work out. All right, just for a while.

So you see, now, we have a problem: we have published, I mean, one “Advent”. You have seen “Advent”, have you? Have you seen the book?

Man: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: “Advent”. No, you go through it. I think it will be a good idea. That was written when he was just progressing in Sahaja Yoga, and now the one he has written is much better, but that's in French. And he would like it to be done in French, that one. We thought we better send it to Algeria which is a cheaper place to print. But, you see, this publishing is like, now say we have got a book this “Advent” or something like that, if you can go through that, these people from Australia have given Me an idea that we should make a – what we call - pocket book out of that. What is that there's some pocket book? Paper, paper bag, paper bag. So for that, you see, I would suggest if you go through that as a publisher, supposing you find which things will be objectionable because it is only meant for Sahaja Yogis. We don’t give this “Advent” to anyone else who is not a Sahaja Yogi. Once you are established in Sahaja Yoga, only this book is given to you, because the truth is so great people cannot just accept the whole. But if you can point out from there whatever is to be eliminated through, we can make it a shorter book and can give more explanations things in there. And then we can publish that book. As far as I'm concerned, I'm yet published already. I’ve written something. But I think it’s too much of the thing.

It’s very simple, naive, absolutely naïve simple language. But I gave it to My husband. He says, “It’s moving, going over my head,” you see. So I think it would be difficult for people to understand.

Yogi: Would it be possible to take several of Your short talks?

Shri Mataji: My talks can be done. Yes, talks can be done. Yes, that's all My talks can be done, and we can sort it out. Talks can be done... I have no objection to that. That’s all right. So you can see to My talks, you see. Because talks are public, so I'm rather careful.

But this book one, that one that I was writing, you see, it has gone through various problems also because I had a lady who was typing, who didn’t know Sanskrit or anything, and she was hopelessly bad, you know. Its typing was hopeless, but still whatever has come up is quite good and is absolutely vibrating. But as My husband is a very brilliant man, he says, “It goes over my head.” So I thought, it’s better to keep it only for Sahaja Yogis, but as you said it’s a good idea. What do you say?

Yogis: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: So we can compile some of the talks. Now who will find out about it? You see, [Pravin?] with some other people. There are four very nice lectures I gave in Bombay in Marathi language which will be now translated in “Nirmala Vidya” and they one whole magazine dedicated itself in India, Marathi magazine, for the publication of these. I think there are six lectures of Mine and four other people have been written there, about the, we have three great saints in India, poet saints, in Maharashtra. So that is Gyaneshwara, and second one was Tukarama, and third was Ramadasa.

So in relation to them, Sahaja Yoga they have described. Like that, it’s a very beautiful magazine, but you don’t know Marathi and the whole magazine is dedicated for that. It's a huge big magazine come out and it’s done very well. So I think that also will be translated, but you know Indians are not so good at English. So you can retranslate.

And I can help you there. It’s very nicely done, one in on Christ and one on Kalki, Christ the complete. Christ one is very beautiful, you see. And for Indians to read about Christ was very remarkable, because, especially Maharashtrians, you see, they were so amazed that He was Mahavishnu and which was. They were so happy ? you don't know ? that they have, we have found out Mahavishnu. They were looking out for Mahavishnu. And here it is: Christ is the Mahavishnu. You see, they were so surprised, the connection.

So I would suggest that if we could compile something like that, would be good idea. It’s very good idea.

So now you people, those who think whatever lecture you think has been quite impressive, not as Sahaja Yogis, but as for normal people, you see. You are little bit abnormal. So you can give some ideas. [Name unclear] will you work it out?

Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You can do it because he's in Brighton and she's a barrister, you see. So she will know the law point. We shouldn’t say anything that they will put Me into jail now, not this year, this time, not this time again.

Yogi: Could I help also, Mother, with that?

Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. That will be nice idea, and also on medical thing, I think Rustom and you both, I, once I talked about medical thing to Rustom, and we worked on the all the endocrines also together. Have you got that with you?

Yogi: I got that sheet right now. The chakras and the plexuses.

Shri Mataji: And the relative endocrine?

Yogi: Doesn’t have much on that, but we could.

Shri Mataji: We could work it out.

Yogi: With Rustom we could work it out.

Shri Mataji: All right. So then, David, what we’ll do that if you want, will you give Me the sheet and all that accordingly, and I’ll say something on the...

Ha Haa! What’s that? What do you have in your hand?

Hmm, these are Sahaja Yogis? So, we will, if you give Me that, then I’ll tape something for you, which you can – that will be good on medical this thing. So medical side; we can have social side and things like that; it will be good idea.

Hmm, is she all right? How are you feeling? Cooler now? Good, good. Right hand and the left? Not yet. Right to the left with the light. With the light you feel cool. Can you imagine? Isn’t it surprising? Some people start feeling the cool breeze coming out of the flame, you see. They start wondering what sort of a flame it is.

What’s that? Ah that’s a Sahaja Yogi on the run, you see? That one, too. All right, let’s see. Running faster. You see, there's an elephant here. Did you see this?

Boy: Yeah

Shri Mataji: And there's an elephant here, too. This is Ebony, you know. This is Ebony.

Boy: What’s that?

Shri Mataji: That’s an elephant.

Boy: What’s that?

Shri Mataji: Which one? This one? Something, I don’t know.

Boy: This is singing there.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you want to sing? All right, let’s have it. Would you sing now? Haan. Now let’s have the music. Now sing a song. Let’s hear. You sing. Otherwise how will you hear? Now come along. Let’s have a nice music. Now you are not just smiling. Now which one you know?

Boy: Twinkle little star.

Shri Mataji: All right.

Boy: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: I can’t sing. He can't do it. He's saying. Will you try again? You sing it now, haan. Sing it now. Let’s hear.

Boy: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: You are not singing.

Yogini: Do you know “Baa Baa Black Sheep”, Steven?

Shri Mataji: Yes, you can say “Baa Baa Black Sheep”. You should say “Baa Baa Black Sheep”. You know that one?

Yogi (singing): Baa baa, black sheep, have you any wool?

Shri Mataji: Now you don’t sing. He's going to sing. Now you don’t sing. He's going to. Now come along. You better sing. Now come along. Let’s have it.

Boy: Sings “Baa Baa Black Sheep”.

Shri Mataji: Very good. It’s coming out very well.

All your nursery rhymes are also so suggestive of Sahaja Yoga. You don't know, for example, “Oranges and [unclear GW: Lemons?]”, and “London Bridge is falling down”. So many; so suggestive they are, so suggestive.

We think they are just rhymes. They are not. It's very suggestive , like the “ Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall”, you see? Ego. “And all the king's men and all the king's horses could not [sit/ put] together Humpty Dumpty again”, and that’s what is going to happen to Ishwaras.

These are tomorrow’s Sahaja Yogis, you see, great ones. They are going to give speeches and they are going to sing, isn’t it? Aren’t you going to sing some Praise of God. Just meditating. Take this. [Unclear]

Boy: Is that Your house?

Shri Mataji: Looks like one.

Boy: Is this Your house?

Shri Mataji: Isn’t it.

Boy: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Yes it's My home...

Boy: [Unclear] built Your house

Yogini: This is Your house?

Shri Mataji: Yes, in a way. Yes, it is. You like it? I have another house, many houses.

Boy: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Yes, and many children.

Boy: Have you got to go?

Shri Mataji: What’s it?

Boy: Have you got to go?

Yogi: He said, “Have you got to go?”

Shri Mataji: I have to go now to London.

Boy: What?

Shri Mataji: To London. You want to come with Me? To London?

Boy: Yes, to London.

Shri Mataji: Yes, come along. So nice [so sweet, so natural.] What’s your name?

Boy: Steven.

Yogis: Steven.

Shri Mataji: Steven. How bold and how great they are! Did she feel the cool breeze? You felt the cool breeze? Steven’s mother? Did you feel the cool breeze? You have such a great soul as your child. That’s your child?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Great. Now you must [all watch him/ know what it is, you see?] He is born-realized child. You see, she's is got it on her head. So now can I take your leave?

Yogi: Mother, could I just show you something?

Shri Mataji: Yes, please. Now this gentleman is here. Hester, you get along, and David, both of you, and try to find out, you see, first of all and the best would be under what headings you would like to say things. And then we'll compile it, to get the things done. Let’s see.

Yogi: Maybe I could read it to You [Unclear].

Shri Mataji: What’s it? It’s from where?

Yogi: Original supposed to [translation from... /unclear]

Shri Mataji: They were people who knew about it much more. Are they extinct now or they are living?

Yogi: The writings are still being translated, Mother. This is just a small portion.

Shri Mataji: It’s all there?

Yogi: Mother, these are supposed to be written by Saint John.

Shri Mataji: So much there, isn’t it? These are all coming up, I must say. From where do they find out all these things, these books? Is it from Vatican?

Yogi: Yes. They kept it all secret.

Shri Mataji: Really, but how, how did they enter in there?

Yogi: These actually, I think, were found somewhere else, in UK, somewhere in Palestine. These ones are somewhere else, Mother. But the others, the bigger portion [is lost away in the battle, Unclear].

Shri Mataji: All these will come one by one, I tell you. They have covered it with heaps and heaps of falsehood. They have to come up.

Yogi: In the cosmic place there's a Prayer to the Mother, prayer to the Lord and prayer to the Mother, and I wrote one for the Son as well....

Shri Mataji: All right, read it, read it loudly.

Yogi: The Prayer to the Heavenly Father: Our Father, Who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for [Thine/ Thy] is the Kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

Mother’s Prayer: Our Mother Who art [on/ upon] Earth, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done [on earth as it is in heaven] as Thy sendest everyday Thy Angels [and [Unclear] also/ give us this day our daily bread?]; and forgive us our sins as we [forgive us our sins, those who trespass against us, unclear?]. And lead us not into sickness, but deliver us from evil, for [Thine] is the Earth the body and the [unclear]. Amen.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. That’s the difference between Father and Mother. The Mother never takes you to sickness; you see. She doesn’t take you to temptation. She tells you frankly, “That's temptation.” The Father tests you. That's the difference, isn’t it? The Mother will never tell you that you try because She knows what it is. But there's a little difference, all right?

Yogi: Mother, I've made one for the Son. Can I just read that?

Shri Mataji: Heh?

Yogi: I've made one of the Son.

Shri Mataji: All right, that's very [Unclear]. Say that.

Yogi: Lord Ganesha, Lord Jesus: Who art in Earth, Who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy names. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, [on earth as it is in heaven]. Give us each day peace and joy; and forgive us our sins as we forgive [who/our] [sinned/sins] against us. And lead us not into confusion. Purify our vision, for Thou art innocence and wisdom.

Shri Mataji: This “Lead us not into confusion” you should put for the Mother. She confuses, all right, because She's Mahamaya. So you can put it for Mother, but He does not lead us into confusion, but into punishment.

Yogi: But purify our vision, for Thou art innocence and wisdom; the Son of our Mother and of our beloved [Father]. Amen

Shri Mataji: They say once even the Goddess, you see, got very angry with Her creation. She got very angry and She said, “Now I'm going to destroy,” and She started the “Tandava”, means the dance of destruction. And then the Father Sadashiva felt that, “Now this is the end of it. If She decides, then who can save?” So He played a trick. He put the child under Her feet, and when She was, see, trying to put Her foot down, when She saw the child She took out a big tongue, “It's My child!” and the whole thing stopped. But when it comes to Father, He is wrathful. When it comes to His destruction, He is not going to care. And even when the Son will destroy, He will not bother. Because it's going too far, then they do not allow. Still, you see, Mother will still, all right, let’s see, still go ahead. She will still keep some inches there, but not the Father. That’s the problem. That is the problem, but once the destruction will start it’s going to be horrid. So we have to hurry up. We have to work up and take it up seriously and understand it’s very, very important, the most important. If you are all destroyed, then what’s the use? At all the Sahaja Yogis are not going to be destroyed; we are all safe. But we have to save more people, and more people, [and more people], all right?

May God bless you.
