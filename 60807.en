Yogi: Shri Mataji, without microphone - this is wonderful, take it.
Shri Mataji: Today we’ll have Ganesha Puja and for that, I think some of you should come up here on the stage. You organised. You also come, so you can tell them. You can get that thing from here to wash the Feet, yes.

We have children here? Some of them are here. Behind you. Also unmarried girls, there must be some. Unmarried girls and children can come. He could have a chair. Can you not give him a chair?
Let them come, all of them. All the children can come. Just see what is there, is there a... Just keep it safe. Now, we can have a... The bigger one would be better.
Yogi: Shri Mataji, can we...
Shri Mataji: This side, if the chair could be get from there.
Yogi: Can we use both?
Shri Mataji: That’s better. You’ve got the water?
Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Till there I will speak, till they have the water.
Yogi: Yes, they will come, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Yes. All right [laughing]. Let him do whatever. Now, why did you start this kind of a thing? It’s not done [laughing]. It’s all right. I told you not to collect any money.
Yogi: Shri Mataji, can we read the Ganesha Atharva?
Shri Mataji: Yes, but first I will speak something. Yogi: All right.
Shri Mataji: [Hindi aside] Can you keep it there for the time being. Now sit down. Who is going to translate? Good.

Today we are going to have Ganesha Puja and is important to do it on the first day, because first, innocence was created on this earth and that is so very important, because it is the support of this world.
Innocent Shri Ganesha is, all His incarnations, because He is an eternal child. Also innocence is eternal; it is never lost. Even when we do mistakes and do wrong things, immoral things, still innocence is just covered, like clouds cover the sun. So one should not worry about what has happened in the past or what wrongs we have done in the past.

We have to first create auspiciousness in any place we start our programs. (Repeating to the translator: “You have to create auspiciousness, wherever...”) Auspiciousness is the power of Shri Ganesha, which gives you an atmosphere which is protected by Him. It protects the children very much. Also protects the women, and all the men who believe in a chaste life. I will not go into the details of the description of Shri Ganesh, which you can find out yourself. But He’s placed on Mooladhara Chakra. This Mooladhara Chakra does all the excretion from our body, so all the filth is thrown out of our body. So, like in a dirty pond, He creates the lotus of this Mooladhara Chakra, and He emits the fragrance, which is His quality.

He is made of the Mother Earth and the essence of the element of Mother Earth is that it has fragrance. Thus, He creates a new world, even in that filth. But He is placed on all the centres, because He is the support of all the centres. So it is very important to understand that, innocence that we achieve after realisation must be respected.
At Agnya Chakra, He comes as Jesus Christ.
He is the Logos [divine reason] so He can walk on the water. He’s very subtle. He’s so subtle that He can pass through this Agnya Chakra of the great Virata. That is why I always tell that, you must forgive everyone if you want to open this centre.
Gradually you will know much more about Him. You should say He is the eldest Son of your Mother.

May God bless you all.

Arharva Sheersha we’ll say. First Ganesha’s mantra. Water you should bring. You put on some towel or something is there. Is there some towel here? Keep it here. That you spread it there. Keep it on top of this. Hello, don’t keep it on the carpet. Is it hot? Very hot?
Yogi: Little bit warm. Little bit warm.
Shri Mataji: Warm is all right.
