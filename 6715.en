I've been always telling you that Sahaja Yoga is the sprouting of your seed within you. When the seed is dormant you cannot visualize the maps it has in it of all the creations it is going to create. Out of one seed how many trees have grown, how many fruits have come out and how many seeds are coming out and how many they are going to produce. You cannot understand how dynamic it is. There has been talk about the spirit within you. Many have said that the spirit is to be brought into our conscious mind. We have to achieve our spirit. We have to get our Yoga – the union with God. When they said it, they meant it to be done, not to be just talked about. But as everything goes to waste much more than it is [actually asked or utilized], all these description of the self to be achieved – how, when – everything got lost because they started just talking about it. People like to intellectualize everything.  They do not want to imbibe it. Just to talk big about something, their ego gets pampered. They'll stand up and give big lectures on Gita and all those things, but they have no idea as to what Gita wants you to do. It wants you to find out the truth. It wants you to get your realization, to have your Yoga established. You have to be born again, you have to be christened as they said, you have to be baptized.


But the difference between the reality and unreality is such that we think if we talk about it, we have done it. This is the illusion – the Mahamaya. We live with it and we carry on with it. We are very happy with it because it means you do not have to face any reality. You can live with unreal life. But you cannot even live with unreal life, can you? That is not going to give you joy. With unreality you are not going to be satisfied. You are not going to get your joy, you are not going to get your meaning and you are going to discard yourself by the useless thing, unless and until you find out why are you here. So everybody wants to find out in a way but honestly [per gram?(unclear)]. He wants to find out the reality on one side; on the other side the slippery ground is always taking him away from the reality. The struggle is on within us. You have to just keep yourself on the ground, not allow yourself to be slipped out into any extreme behavior for anything whatsoever. Just be there – it works out. But we are extremist in everything we go to extremes.


Just now today I was discussing capitalism, democracy and communism. Say, Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul – no doubt. He had his vision of democracy. But he could not fulfill it because others were not realized souls. They could not come up to his vision and they could not imbibe these things within them. They just praised him. He's their hero. They'll make a statue out of him, garland him, write books on him, but nothing of Abraham Lincoln goes into their being, nothing. They do not follow him in the way he lived his life. They'll call them Lincolnists or something like that. Some sort of a “ism” they'll put to that. They will try to possess him, brand him into something, but not try to imbibe him into themselves.


Then, Lenin was a realized soul, too, as I told you, he was a realized soul. He had a vision of collectivity – very proper vision he had. But he found that people are going to fail him. He cannot do it. So he had to, he shifted into another. He drifted. Anywhere you find a person who's a realized soul, in his own way he has made contribution. 


I'll say Shakespeare [the other day I went to (unclear)]. Now, Shakespeare was a very great realized soul, no doubt about it. His contribution is so beautiful, but people do not see it. They have no eyes to see what he's trying to show. Say we saw “Hamlet”. “Hamlet” is what? Is nothing. He's trying to show the futility of every nonsense we do. First of all a man killing another king. Then the woman running after that man. Because the father is killed the father comes to the boy and compels him that you should take revenge. He taking revenge. One little girl, innocent girl, madly loving that fellow. I mean, the whole life is made into something so small. The mother's life – she has no esteem. She thinks that by loving this man she is the last word. So she can kill her husband. The husband – so-called the second husband – he thinks by killing this man and getting this woman, he achieves the last. Then the third person is this poor son, who gets the ghost to tell him that this has happened. The ghost himself should die and go away from this world and live where he is. But he comes back and tells him that, “You take the revenge.” He is not interested in his spirit, in his well-being. The father also. Now the son takes a tip and he goes on hating. He gets into this of destroy. He wants to destroy this man. In that destruction he kills the father of that little girl – his fiancee – and the girl also dies. She also becomes mad. Everybody becomes mad. Even Hamlet becomes mad.


What does he show? You see, I call him Shakespeare, a avdhyuta. Avdhyuta is a person who's beyond. He's a person who's not an incarnation. Incarnation comes on this earth, plays with you, lives with you, acts like you, goes with you into all kinds of moods and things you live with, and tries to help you on that level. The incarnation can come down very little. They do not. They keep themselves there. And what do they show? The futility, the futility of this kind of a nonsensical life people are leading. This is what he tried to show in “Hamlet”. Now how many people who read “Hamlet” understand this point that the futility of even taking the revenge on his mother or the fellow who killed his father was there. It's so evident. All those emotions to which we pay so much importance and make it so much identified with your whole life are nothing but wasteful and futile things. We are wasting our energy. So he puts a drama before you. See, this drama is a play. See now. Now what happens, you become Hamlet if you see that. You become one of the persons. If you see that drama you'll become Hamlet. Immediately you start thinking, “How many revenges I have to take.” You'll make a list of people. You immediately become Hamlet. You do not become Shakespeare; you become Hamlet. “And now how many people have I to hurt? How many revenges have I to take? Which is the way I should do? Should I play a drama the way he played?” Or you can even become the lady. You can even become the person who killed. You can become anything instead of becoming deep person who has created it.


That's how we live in unreality in our lives all the time. Instead of imbibing Christ's life within our life, we find another drama. We play with that drama and identify ourselves with that drama. This drama is going to keep you in the dramatic condition all the time. Reality is to finish the drama, to know that it is a drama. We are not part and parcel of that. This is what is the real state of the mind. Unless and until that is achieved, you are not going to be happy, you are not going to be satisfied, you are not going to be yourself, you are not going to find out your meaning. This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that the happening takes place within you, the Kundalini rises within you. She passes through all these various centers and gives you that, what we call the Self-realization, by enlightening your consciousness with the spirit. If seed is the spirit, then Kundalini is the water that pours on it its grace and manifests it in our consciousness. It is manifested by itself, but not in our consciousness. So our consciousness and our attention becomes one with that. This is how the things work out.


One has to know that God has created you. You have not created yourself. He has made you human beings from amoeba stage. He has brought you to this level and He's going to give you the ultimate. He's going to do it for you. It's His job. It's not your job. Now in a case like that when you think that there is – say first case is we can take of people who believe in social injustice sort of going on. What should we do in social injustice? Which is the greatest force? Which is the greatest power on this earth? The one which manages all the other powers is the power of God. Today as the time is, achieve that power and then work it out through that power and not through your intellectual power, which will create problems for you. Any social injustice, if you work it out on your level, will never reach its successful stage. It will be just falling short of its achievement. Everything has gone wrong because of that. The power that controls the whole universe, every part of it, every particle of it, every atom of it, is the power which is called as Divine Power of God. That is the power of God's Love. In His love He bestows all that is beautiful to you and removes all that is ugly in you. For that He may have to sometimes even kill you. He may have to even destroy. It's His power. It's not your power to destroy anyone. You have no right to destroy. It is His power to destroy you.
                                                         

Please put your hands like this and sit quietly. Don't make noises and things in Sahaja Yoga. You see, all these things which these gurus have done to you and you are really ruined by them. That happening takes place within yourself and not outside. All these ideas come to us again from the same myth that we can achieve our realization, we can stand on our head, we can breathe fast, we can breathe less. How can it be? I mean, everything these things are done by animals and by every person. How can you do it? You cannot do anything to achieve your Self-realization. This must be accepted with complete humility. It's also God's job. Everything He does. Only thing what you have to do is to merge into His Power and then you can tell Him whatever you like because then you become His Power and you can work it out. But anything external that you are doing now before realization has no meaning. When the power flows through you, then you can maneuver it, then you can organize it, you can work it out. First of all, achieve your spirit. Then allow it to manifest itself within you, fully establish it. After full establishment, then you work it out. There is no hanky-panky about it, one should know, and you cannot befool anyone. It's something that has to happen within you. We are deceiving ourselves. Do not do that. We do not want to waste our lives. We are not going to make ourselves so low as to destroy this being which is just there to manifest. All those things that you worry about – say our personal things and natural things and this and that and that and that – you cannot help it out; you cannot cure it. Unless and until you are a realized soul you cannot help it and that, too, a realized soul in a very collective way. If you are collectively realized you can do it; otherwise, you cannot do it.


The whole emancipation and the whole great work of bringing humanity into the kingdom of God is only possible if you all get your realization fully established. Now after realization also I received a telephone call today from someone that, “Mother, that day I got realization all my worries went away, I  got completely relaxed and the cool breeze started coming into my hand. I felt very much better, but now gradually again the tension is mounting up. Is my Self-realization temporary?” Self-realization is not temporary, but you are temporary. How much attention have you paid to yourself? For example, some guest is coming to your house and you close the doors to him. Will he come to you begging of you? If he comes inside also you do not give it a proper eminence as the position is. The spirit is the highest and if you do not give it the highest position, that my spirit is the highest and I must pay full attention to my spirit and you fritter away your attention on to other things, is he going to be there on your seat of heart? Is he going to be settled down there? How much attention have you paid to your Self-realization? You have taken it for granted, and then what have you done about it? The spirit won't be happy with [one person?]. When the spirit starts manifesting through you like light, it wants that it should be put on a higher place from where everybody could see and get their spirit. It wants its company. It seeks its collectivity. If it is not there it is going to run away. If you cannot enjoy the love [from or of?] other Sahaja Yogis you are not going to achieve it.


Now in this country of yours I must say we had a variety of Sahaja Yogis which is something such a great drama for me also to see. And the varieties and varieties I've seen in the West I've never seen them before, especially in England because they are very cosmopolitan and international. Now the lowest level of Sahaja Yogis are there who think that they can exploit Sahaja Yoga to such an extent. I mean, they are such low types that you cannot imagine. They go to a program in the ashram. Then they eat food, that's all – not even pay for it. I mean, that level we have. There are many who never just pay their money. Can you imagine? Of that level we have people who go to the ashram where they make others pay for their food. Just they want to go there. Here you are paying for a wretched guru, who came the other day, and gave him a Rolls Royce as a present. Do you know that? Who is well-known,  that he is a swindler, he's made money and all that, out of hypnotism. People starve themselves, beg, borrowed and gave money to him to buy a Rolls Royce.


And here is Sahaja Yoga which gets all kinds of lepers. One of them is this kind – I think this is the worst of all – and this kind of people should not expect much in Sahaja Yoga. It's better they leave and go away. They cannot rise of this level of people who think that they can go to a place and eat the food and do not even pay, and make others pay. I mean, this is too much. I can't even understand such people. I mean, these are not human-beings. Must be some worms born here or some parasites.


Then the second kind are, there are some people who, who do not know that you have to work for Sahaja Yoga. You have to work for others. You are not going to die if you are working for others. You are not to judge that what others are working. If I were to judge how much you are working, I would have given up absolutely long time back. See the disparity in My style of working and your style of working. You know that I work day-in and day-out. Nights together I keep awaken. I travel for miles together without any complaint. Today is the first day perhaps I [unclear – did not?]. After all, I have  
this physical body, and you know how much I have worked. Working on single person for hours together and also we lose that person so many times. It's so disappointing and so frustrating. And you people are avoiding work. You want others to wash your dishes even. Why don't you wash the dishes of others for a change? What does it matter? You are not going to die. 


But this comes out of, all these things come out of ego. But what they were the first one I don't know from where it comes that you don’t pay for your food. These people will never stick on to Sahaja Yoga unless and until they change themselves from [without?]. One has to work very, very hard on yourself.


Now the third taboo is to keep yourself cleansed. You have to work. You have to see what are your vibrations, how are you, what are your problems. You all have had problems you created for yourself. If you were beautiful flowers I would have done the job Myself. But no, you have really ruined yourself. So you have to clear out yourself. You have to work it out. You have to clear out yourself. You have to love yourself as you have to love others. Now you have to love yourself. Now come to that point. You have to respect yourself because this is now the temple of God. You are a realized soul. You are a saint. Love yourself. How much I love you, in the same way you have to love yourself and care for your body, care for your mind, care for your spirit, pay attention to your spirit. “Is my spirit happy with me? Am I doing what I should have done for my spirit or am I doing something for my ego or for my superego or for saving some money out of my food?”


All these things are to be seen within us. I am not saying it for others. I'm saying for individual persons to see what are our problems are. Now even those who are ardently believing into Sahaja Yoga and are going into it must know that they have had really big problems. I've never told but some of you are suffering from cancer which is settling in fast, and I am worried about that. Some of you have serious physical problems which I have not told you. Some of you have very, very serious mental problems. You must see all those things. You must correct yourself. As I said, you must love yourself and understand that you are the saint. You cannot just play about with yourself and try to ruin it, just not paying any attention to yourself, just taking it easy. It's a precious trust you have with you because your spirit is enlightened, because you are the light for all the rest of the people of this world who are walking in the dark. Keep your light afloat. Keep it clean. You are specially you are bestowed this. Upon you this great grace has fallen. All this beauty, are you going to waste it because your light is not shown through your dirty panels? We have to think about it and that's how one should come up at least this much. Then one can work it. Face yourself as you are. You try to give explanations. Explanations are not [wanted?]. Who wants explanations here? Whom are you giving? I am your Mother. I love you. What explanations are you giving? Even anything big happens to you, I will go out of the way to save you. Even if you beat Me, and murder Me still I love you. So what explanation can you give Me? No explanation is needed, My children. It is what you do to yourself is the point I’m concerned about you. What are you doing to yourself is the main point.


And when you understand that, “Am I the most beautiful representative of Sahaja Yoga? Am I the person who can influence others with my light? Am I looking after my light?” very easy to make out, you get your vibrations. Your vibrations are flowing if you are enlightened. There is the way of finding it out where you are. It's not like other gurus just taking money from you, and you are walking in the dark. If you know what chakras you are catching, where is the problem, what is happening to you, why it is happening, what are the deities, what mantras to be said – everything you know – despite that, why is it that there is no progress and growth? Because you have no self-esteem, you have no love or you are not in the center. Unless and until you are in the center – that's what these avdhyutas have done all throughout. They have tried to show that be in the center. Why are you going to extremes? Leave it to God. Now, when it comes to that we are very clever to cheat ourselves [that’s intelligence (unclear)]. Leave it to God. So cleansing, you leave it to God, all right? That's what part you leave it to God – that God should clean [it or us?]. That part is God's job. And what is your job then it’s to do, what do you do? If I ask then what are you supposed to do? If I have to do cleaning, I have to look after all your meditation, I have to put your Kundalini up, I have to keep it there hanging, and you have to [pull (unclear)] that, that's your job. In every possibility you try to pull down your Kundalini. How long is she going to be there?


I'm giving you the extreme case but despite all that, Kundalini is your own mother. I'm much more spread out than she. She's just localized within you, she loves you very much, she loves you very much and she tells Me what's wrong with you. She asks for forgiveness for you. She wants Me to [ran?] her child. She puts forward all the problems you have. She wants Me to work hard. She works hard herself very much, day in and day out. Once she's awakened she has no sleep. Twenty-four hours she's working, she's helping you, she's guiding you, she's co-ordinating all the things that are needed for you. She brings all the blessings upon you to show that now you are awakened, you are growing, you are transforming, you are changing. See, see for yourself. She is the one who pierces the Sahastrara, and the whole grace falls upon you. Without her piercing the grace is also useless. Without her awakening I'm useless. Without her help I cannot do anything. For such a mother what homage do we pay? What do we do for her to please her? We should find out. She's pleased all the time. That doesn't mean that you take her for granted. It is your duty, your gratitude which expands. So to grow in the center is to be in the center, to see that you do not go to extremes. As I have told you that the things that are to be done by you should be done by you, and whatever are to be done by God will be done by God. The simple example is that when it comes to cleansing your personal things you leave it to God, but when it comes, say, to telling others something which will hurt them, you take it up upon yourself which will show off your ego. We've had examples and examples of ego-oriented people – horrible people they were. They took up upon themselves Sahaja Yoga, they became the big like gurus and they started preaching. I'm so frightened in my lifetime if they are doing like this what is going to happen [if I am gone?]. Humble down yourself in your heart. There resides the spirit of your being, of your attraction – attraction for the Divine, for God Almighty to be gracious on you, to be happy with you, and in Hindi language is to be prassana with you, to be pleased with you. We say, “O God! Be gracious to us, be kind to us, bestow Your grace upon us and Your mercy upon us.” We ask in humility. He loves you. No one can love that much. His love is dynamic. He is so great that you cannot describe Him in words – just you can feel Him. We should not be thorn for ourselves and for Him. We are problems for Him. We are creating problems for Him. We are not helping in any way. We are nothing but problems and problems for Him. A day will come He will just recede from you.


Give up your personal things, personal problems and think of the bigger problems for which you have to ask His grace. Do not start solving yourself those problems but ask for His grace and be humble – be humble in your heart. Be a witness of the whole thing, the absurdities into which you are driven into. Be a witness. As Hamlet has shown how he's ruined the family – his own and everybody's family. He was doing something right according to all human laws but not according to God's law. You have not to take the law into your hand of God. God is going to. But, for collective things you have got courts and this and that. Let them work it out. You don't worry about those. You worry about your own punishments you want to bestow on a person. Do not do that. Let God punish them. Why do you want to do the dirty work of punishment? It's horrible. I mean, if I have to punish somebody I don't like it. I mean, it's horrible thing to punish someone. Why do you want to do it? Do the beautiful, that is, love others. Loving is the most beautiful thing – is the most energy-giving. When you love others only that the love flows into you. Otherwise, why should love come into you? If you are not giving the light, why should light comes into you? Love others as you love thyself but here thyself love itself is destructive. Christ never knew there are people like that who are all the time destructive to themselves.


There are in so many lectures I've suggested what is the special [problem?] of the West is, and one of them is left Vishuddhi, and if you go to the subtlest of subtlest point where we are at left Vishuddhi that we can always find out the injustice done to us and to others but not what injustice we are doing 
to others. To avoid that we say that [unclear]. Supposing I'm My child. Now I would take up the blame on [the family, what’s wrong with me [ unclear ]  [because I would say both the thing] that I will tell you , “What am I to do  to understand?”  or else what second thing I will do is to feel guilty. “Oh! I know. I know I should not but I'm [that?] [ (unclear)]” and in this small thing [that we ] can see how we are deceiving ourselves – the self which is your light, the self which is your meaning, the self that is Satchitanand. That's the one which is the truth, which is the attention of God and which is the joy we are deceiving [unclear] every moment -- better to be honest, face ourselves and put it right. 


May God bless you!


Hain na ho gaya na theek, haan.) (Hindi) There was nothing to worry. You are all right now. Got it. See, takes time, but comes up. You are all right now. See, it's all right. Nothing wrong now. You're all right. Takes time. Kundalini works out. Have faith.


All those who have come for the first time, please close your eyes. [Huun, aaj to bahut achcha hai, theek  ho gaye naa aap? Haan.(Hindi)] Just close your eyes who have come for the first time. Put both the hands on your lap and feet on the ground, touching the ground. When the time comes, then only you get your realization. A little time has to be matured, you see, for every person though it's working out. You cannot say what time exactly a flower is going to become a fruit, can you? In the same way, it's a living process, it takes its own time and as a by-product it gives you all the other things. But how far you imbibe it and how far you go further with it is to be seen. 


Hmm! [Unclear] Good


Band karo dono aankh. Bahut achcha.] (Hindi)


Aside – Hmm! Right hand. You've been working very hard. 


Close your eyes. Put your both the hands towards me like this and close your eyes. Hmm! Better.


Huun, thanda aa raha hai haath mein? Aapke aa raha hai thanda?) (Hindi)
