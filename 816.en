Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – VERIFIED

I bow to all the seekers of truth. The seekers of truth is a very special category of people. They existed in all the centuries before also. And you find glimpses of that in many literary work. Today I read a book written by Ayala from Spain who was there in 1906. And he had described a seeker of truth how he became a saint.

William Blake from England, about hundred years back he lived, has said that, “The time will come when many seekers of truth will be born. They are the men of God, they will be transformed, and they will have powers to transform others”. This transformation is what we call, is the birth which takes place second time. It is not just a certificate we should have, from some institution that we are born again. Or we have become a twice born person, as we call in India a Brahmin, who thinks that he is really baptised. But the real baptism is a happening.

Recently there has been a very beautiful discovery of Saint Thomas’s writings, who was a disciple of Christ and on his way to India, he wrote a beautiful description of what a saint should be, and what Christ wanted us to be, in a very large book, and put it in a jar in Egypt. This book was recovered only 48 years back and has been again deciphered by a very good gentleman who came out with the book called Gnostic. Now Gna in Sanskrit language also means to know. To know on your central nervous system. Is not a mental knowledge. By reading books you cannot become a realised soul. It is not a mental achievement. That’s exactly what Saint Thomas has written that it is not a mental thing.

That it has to be a happening within us, by which we know our self we get our real baptism. He’s against all kinds of theories of sufferings. He says Christ has suffered for us. We have to just awaken Christ within us. And God Almighty is a  father who is so much full of compassion and love for His children. Why should He make you suffer? Logically one should understand if Christ has suffered for us are we going to suffer more than Christ has suffered? Has He left something undone that we have to suffer any more? He suffered because there was a problem in the human awareness. People were lost in ritualism and in philosophic discussions. So His message was that of resurrection. That is being clearly shown if you see the Sistine Chapel in Vatican you see a huge big Christ sitting there and judging people and giving them resurrection. So the time has come for us, all of us, to enter into the kingdom of God. Now the time has come, this is the blossom time that many have to become the fruits.

When we see the chaos and confusion around us we get very depressed and upset about it. And we think there’s going to be a shock we are all going to be destroyed. But you must remember that the creator is all-powerful. And He is not going to allow His creation to be destroyed. And His greatest creation and creations are human beings. He is not going to allow them to destroy themselves. It’s already being arranged within us as you can see clearly, you have been told. We have a beautiful machinery built in within ourselves to work out the Kundalini awakening. As if you were made into a beautiful computer already programmed in a very efficient manner by the Divine, which commits no mistakes.

And you are just to be now connected to the mains. Once you are connected to the mains you start working as a very fantastic dynamic compassionate personality. This has happened to so many who are here. They write to Me that they are swimming in the ocean of joy. Also Mohammed Sahib has said that, “At the time of resurrection your hands will speak and they will  give witness against you.” That resurrection time is today. That has to work out.

Regarding Realisation I must say in a short time you cannot tell lot of things. But first we have to know that a person who says that he can connect you to the Divine does not take any money from you, does not expect anything from you, and just out of his connection, connection with the Divine, works out your connection with the Divine, is the real saint. He is the real master. Not the one who lives on the earnings of people whom he says that, “I’m doing Divine work.” Nor can you have any organisations nor you could have any membership.

It is the becoming that is a real transformation within. When you need not be told what is to be done, you become the spirit. And when you become the spirit, the spirit becomes your guide, and he guides you in his enlightenment. In its enlightenment you see the right path. You become righteous, you become compassionate, you become peaceful, you become innocent. Above all you become powerful, your compassion and love becomes powerful. You develop a new awareness within yourself on your central nervous system. What we call as collective consciousness. That is you can feel another person on your fingertips. That you can feel your self, your own centres on your fingertips.

This awareness manifests as a reality within yourself. You do not have to have certificate from others. You get your own certificate. But when we get identified with some organisation or with some ideas or some dogmas or fanaticism then we become blind. Because it is so mental. Is difficult to get out of the conditionings. Because you think you represent something. But it’s not benevolent for you. You could be a Hindu a Christian, Muslim, any religion but you can commit any sin. Anybody can kill. Nobody improves by joining these organisations.

But the incarnations and prophets, those who came on this earth who started all these religions, were real. They wanted to give us a great progress in our evolution. Actually they created these Chakras in the sense that they resided on these Chakras. They were the milestones of our evolution like the flowers on the Tree of Life. But people plucked them, they said, “This is my flower, this is my flower.” And then they worshipped those dead flowers. That is why we find all these problems created in the name of God.

One has to understand that what benevolence you have got out of it and if one person gets the benevolence, if it is the truth, everybody must get it the same way. Now the truth is supposing there are flowers here you can see clearly with your own eyes. Or we can say that human beings can feel the filth, they can smell the filth. Animals cannot. Is a fact everybody knows that, but the truth is known to everyone. And they all behave in the same manner. But when you become something, say of any caste or community or any religion or any race or any nation, you all don’t behave the same way. You do not react the same way. Some of you can be very good people, some of you could be excellent but some of them could commit sins. And could manage with all those sins to live and excuse themselves.

But as soon as this transformation takes place, you see in that light, you immediately see in that light that this is wrong. Like you are holding a snake in the hand in darkness and you don’t see the snake. If anybody tells you there’s a snake you don’t want to accept it. But as soon as the light comes within you, you see the snake and you just drop it yourself. And this should happen to all of them the same way if it is the truth. All those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis have to behave in a manner that a saint behaves. But they enjoy it, they enjoy their virtues, they enjoy their love and compassion for others. They enjoy their peace their spirit, so they don’t care for other comforts of life. They become transformed persons. Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”. With this happening you develop very innocent powerful eyes. Even a glance of such a personality can bring peace and comfort. He emits love and manifests compassion. And this compassion acts.

We have never tried the power of love so far. But only after Realisation you feel the all-pervading power of love around us. They have described about the power of love so many times, but nobody has said what is this power of love. So this Kundalini is like the connection, which is coiled into three and a half coils. I have seen some books describing Kundalini as a terrible thing, that it harms people. Is all falsehood. These people may not be knowing anything about it or maybe they do not have proper purity within themselves. In Sahaja Yoga thousands of people have got Realisation, they have got physically cured, emotionally settle down, mentally all right, and spiritually in the highest spirits.

You won’t believe here there are people of so many nations together. And they all are enjoying, forgetting, transcending all the differences of their races, of their countries, of their little little small pockets in which they were born. God created only one world. We have made different countries. Not only that, but we think that we are all different people. Of course He has not created even one leaf like the other. In the same way we are created differently. This is variety to create beauty. But this has led us to lots of confusions. So this Kundalini is your Mother. She is your individual Mother and She knows everything about you. And She is anxious to give your second birth. She is anxious that you should get this benevolence.

But it is your pure desire only that can manifest this happening.All other desires are impure. Because it is said in economics that in general desires are not satiable, wants are not satiable. So, these desires are not pure. We move from one desire to another desire. So the pure desire within us, which is the power of Kundalini, is to be one with the Divine, to be in yoga with the Divine.

This is achieved through the awakening of Kundalini.
But what is Kundalini, is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. We have God the father, God the son, but what about the mother? How can you think of a father, and a son and not of the mother? Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother. And She is reflected within us as the Kundalini. And in the heart is reflected the God Almighty. God Almighty is the witness. Witness of the play of the Holy Ghost that is His power. They are inseparable, like moon and moonlight or sun and sunlight. That is why when the Yoga takes place, the Kundalini rises up to the head here up to the fontanelle bone area, breaks through this fontanelle area and you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. This is the seat of the spirit, though in human beings it resides in the heart.

So I hope today those who have not got yet Realisation, will get their Self Realisation definitely. And tomorrow, we’ll be able to explain to you in some more details about it. Remember, you are a special category of people. As they have been singing, the meaning of the song was, is composed by the Swiss only, in Hindi language, the most surprising thing, and singing in an Indian tune, which is very difficult. And the meaning of the song was that: Oh Mother, we must have done something good in our last lives, that we have got our Self Realisation.

I hope you all will get your Realisation tonight. Now if you have any questions, we can have about say for ten, fifteen minutes any questions, if you have.

Question: This gentleman would like to know the meaning of the Shri Chakra that is seen on the poster.

Shri Mataji: Shri Chakra is one of the big centres on the right-hand side that we have within ourselves. And it works out all the Divine work. Of course, you must know that all this is a big organisation within yourself. Like here you come in the room. If you have to switch on, you just put one switch, and the whole thing is on. But it is all built in. You don’t have to do anything about it, just press the button, you get the lights. In the same way, you are made with different Chakras within yourselves.

And once you are enlightened, then it is better to know about that. Say, supposing I do not put on the light and start giving you a lecture, about the history about the whole thing, how the electricity was brought in Geneva, how it was put up here, you will have a headache. So best is first to have your Realisation and then you will know each and everything because it’s such a great knowledge. And you also get that inner sight in your brain that you can understand many things.

Question: Who is Shri Kalki?

Shri Mataji: That is again, you see actually, all these things cannot be disclosed, why the reason? I tell you. Christ said that He was the son of God. And He said He was the path, and He was the gate. What He said was absolute truth, absolute truth for Me, and for all the Sahaja Yogis. But before that, if I say something, I don’t want to get crucified. So once you get your Realisation, you will know who is Shri Kalki, you will know who is who, what I am, everything you will know. But first of all you get your Realisation is a better idea.

Truth is to be seen and known, not to be believed. That is blind faith. Only after enlightenment I call it the Shraddha, is the enlightened faith. You should not also believe Me. Unless and until I give you Realisation, why should you believe Me? But you should be like scientist, to keep your mind open. May be what I am saying is a hypothesis and if it is proved, then you should believe Me. Supposing I say, I am such and such, why should you believe Me? There are many who claim like that and prove nothing, just take money.

Already in thoughtless awareness. There’s a state in which people go, when the Kundalini rises a little bit. What we call is a thoughtless awareness, where you are aware, but a thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off. In between the thoughts there’s a little space, that is the present. Either you live in the future or in the past, so in that present thing you become silent, and you just watch your thoughts. As if you are standing in the water, you are afraid of the water, but once you get on to the boat, you see it. In the same way you see your thoughts, you are not afraid of them, you stand on that peace. But when you become a master swimmer, you can jump into the water and save many others.

So reality has to be known on your central nervous system. Not what I say, or what a book says, or what somebody says, nothing of the kind. What your hands are saying, what you are feeling. Tomorrow I’ll tell you how the diseases get cured with the Kundalini awakening. For your information, in Delhi university, they have made research, in the university, they are making research on Sahaja Yoga, on the psychosomatic diseases, and on physical abilities of people in Sahaja Yoga. And two doctors now on these two subjects have got their MD’s. And also in London there are seven doctors who are now collecting datas and will be submitting their theses and papers. But tomorrow I’ll explain to you.

Question: Many Yogas say, that one should not try to cure the Chakras. Not to raise the Kundalini before the
chakras are in good shape. First put the Chakra in good shape.

Shri Mataji: You see what they say, because whatever they know about it. Supposing I say it’s not necessary. Then there’s something special about Me? Maybe I’m so compassionate or loving, that I love you so much that I can manage the show? Like some surgeon can do things which are miraculous.
All right. So let us now go in for Self Realisation.

It's a very spontaneous happening. Only thing today I will tell you how you, yourself, can raise your own kundalini and get your realisation. But it cannot be forced. I would request you one small thing is to take out your shoes to get the help from the Mother Earth. Also the shoes make you a little tight on your feet.

Another thing I have to make a very humble request is that, as I have told you that if you have to enter the beautiful kingdom of the Divine and you should not have any guilt about it. You should not feel guilty about anything whatsoever at this moment. Forget the past, forgive yourself, because, after all, human beings can make mistakes -not gods - can make mistakes, can they? So there is nothing to feel so guilty about anything. More it is a fashion I think sometimes to feel guilty all the time. But that spoils the centre of visshuddhi on the left-hand side so badly that you can develop diseases like angina, heart angina, you can develop spondylitis. I remember the French, first time I went to Paris, they told me, ‘Mother don’t say you are a happy person, you have joy’ I said ‘why?’ ’They believe here that you must be an ignorant person, ignoramus, that you feel happy’. So I started my lecture with ‘Les Miserables’. So, not to feel miserable at all. As I told you, you are the best creation of God. You are the temple of the Divine and have faith in yourself.

Now, those who smoke, supposing, they do not spoil this chakra by smoking but by feeling guilty that they are smoking and you need not be ‘serious’ about it also!

You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Supposing we are going for a holiday or something how happy we are. But this is what we are going to achieve, the greatest thing in life and lives, so we have to be prepared in a very happy mood for it.

All right, so please put both the hands and feet parallel to each other. Tomorrow I’ll tell you why the left and the right are important, because the left represents emotions and desire and the right represents action. Before closing your eyes I’ll show you what we have to do, a simple thing. Put your left hand towards me please, like this, on your lap, be comfortably seated, not in a slouchy manner, or in er what you call, too much of a tense manner, but straight, with the left hand towards Me. If anything is tight on your body you can loosen it. Now, put the left hand towards Me, like this. This represents your desire to get realisation. First you have to put your hand on your heart where resides the spirit. On your heart. Then you have to put your hand on the upper part of your abdomen– on the left-hand side – we work on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. Then you have to put your right hand lower part of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the centre of pure knowledge which has to manifest on your central nervous system. Now you put your right hand in the upper part again. Again, for raising the kundalini, put it on your heart. Now the hand goes in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, put your hand, your head to the right please. This is the centre is caught, as I told you, when you feel guilty so you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Now you have to put your hand on top of your forehead across and press it, as if when you have your headaches, like this. This is the centre of Christ and you have to forgive. On the back side you put your hand and push back your head. This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness, without feeling guilty. Now, stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your head on the fontanelle bone area where it was soft when you were a child. Bend your head and push back your fingers and press your scalp, move it seven times clockwise, bend your head. That’s all. But I saw people doing it – you have to press back your fingers and press this hard on the head. Now you can take out your spectacles if you like. This might help your eyesight.

Now, please close your eyes. You don’t have to open your eyes until I tell you. When I tell you you can open your eyes later on, because the attention has to be inside. Don’t force your mind, force anything, like your thoughts or anything, it will all spontaneously work out. So please put your left hand towards me, keep your neck straight and both the feet apart from each other. Now, please put the right hand on your heart. Here you ask Me a very fundamental question. If you want you can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother. Please ask the question ‘Mother, am I the spirit?’ Ask this question three times. Three times you ask in your heart. Now, take down your hand on the left-hand side in the upper part of your abdomen and press it. If you are the spirit you are your master, so now, please, ask the second question three times ‘Shri Mataji, am I my own master?’ Now, take down your hand to the lower part of your abdomen and press it hard. Here, again, I cannot take your freedom for granted. You have to ask for pure knowledge to manifest on your central nervous system, so please say ‘Mother, please give me pure knowledge’. Please say it six times because this centre has got six sub-plexuses. Now, raise your hand again to the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. By saying that you wanted the pure knowledge the kundalini has started moving upward, but to give her a full support and to fully open this centre of mastery, you have to say, with full confidence, ten times, ‘Mother, I am my own master’ You have to do after she has translated me, it’s better, you keep better rhythm. Now raise your hand on to your heart and with full confidence again, please say twelve times ‘Mother, I am the spirit’. Now raise your hand into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right and press it hard. Here you have to say sixteen times ‘Mother I am not guilty at all’. One has to know that the Divine is the ocean of compassion and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and what mistake I may commit that He cannot forgive us? If you still think you are guilty you had better punish yourself by saying it 108 times! It is the hottest chakra you have got. Some people are doing the wrong way. Put the right hand in the corner of the left-hand side of your shoulder and your neck. Right hand. Please raise your right hand and left hand towards Me. Now put your right hand on top of your forehead please and press it hard. Here you have to say ‘Mother, I forgive everyone’. Right hand. Now press it hard. You have to say you forgive everyone from your heart. Many people lose their chance of realisation because they don’t know how to forgive. They say it is difficult but whether you forgive or you don’t forgive it’s a myth. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands, so please forgive from your heart. Now push back your hand onto the back side of your head and put the load of your head on your hand. Here, now, you have to say, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, ‘Oh, Divine, if I have done anything wrong please forgive me’. Now, stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area. Bend your head and put left hand towards Me, bend your head and now press back your fingers and press your scalp and  move it seven times clockwise, where you have to say ‘Mother, please give me my realisation, Mother give me my realisation’ seven times, because I cannot force on you, you have to ask for it.

Now take down your hand please. Slowly open your eyes. Now put the right hand towards Me. Put down your head and see with your left hand if there’s a cool breeze coming on your head, coming through your head, through the fontanelle bone area. Now put the left hand towards Me, now, and put the right hand on top of the head and see for yourself there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Just bend your head, sometimes it's quite far away you get it. Once again put your right hand towards Me and put your left hand on top of your head and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now put both your hands on top of – push back your head and ask a question ‘Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, Mother?’ ‘Is this the Brahma Chaitanya?’ ‘Is this is the all-pervading power of God’s Love?’ Take down your hands please. Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head or on their fingertips or in their hands, please raise both your hands. Most of you have felt it, very surprising. (pointing) You committed some mistake but it’s all right, we’ll work it out. May God bless you, may God bless you, so many of you have felt it. (pointing) ‘What about you, did you feel it?’ In the blue shirt. (slightly warm) It’s all right I know that, that’s why I asked you. Gradually it will become cool, all right? You have to forgive from your heart. If you have felt warm then you have to forgive from your heart. Let us again forgive, all of us, forgive from your heart, just say closing your eyes, we forgive everyone from our heart, just say it like that, just say it. And now, feel it, both the hands, put it down. Are you feeling the cool breeze? The more you forgive the better it will be, just forgive. Now it’s all over. All right? Most of you have felt it, very few have not felt. All right, doesn’t matter, they’ll feel it tomorrow and tomorrow I’ll meet you all individually and I’ll fix up the people, meeting them, in the sense that you must know that you have to now respect your realisation. Tomorrow it will be deeper still, but it’s like the parable of Christ that some seed fell on the rocks and some fell in the good soil. The you all have to become trees, masters. Hardly you take any time for it. So tomorrow invite your friends, as many as possible and I hope all of you will be completely settled in yourself, but don’t think about it, otherwise tomorrow you’ll say we lost the vibrations. By thinking you come down. Don’t argue about it, let it be as it is. May God bless you all.
