Havan after Guru Puja

Shri Mataji: First we are going to have the “namaaz”. We have to learn how to do “namaaz” today, because it's a Guru's Day. Now where is...? - Come along! All of you who are here should learn how to do “namaaz”. Now stand here. Facing Me. Come along!

Gregoire: I would like that everybody sit down, so that everybody can see.

Shri Mataji: No, you have to stand up, because you have to do accordingly.

Djamel: I was thinking you all stand up and stand in rows. You have to leave a space in front of you, there has to be a certain space so that you bow down.

Shri Mataji: May I have some water to drink.

Gregoire: We should all stand in a circle, leaving space between each circle around Shri Mataji, so that we can bow. So everybody stands in three or four circles, with one meter at least between the two circles

Shri Mataji: Where are you going to have lunch?

Sahaja Yogini: We are going to bring it here Mother.

Shri Mataji: All right, that's all right.

Are you all listening now?

Just move it backwards.

Saha Yogi: Mother I will put this over here which will shade you a little.

Shri Mataji: Sorry.

Sahaja Yogi: I think I did it a little too far.

Shri Mataji: Its because its coming up, all right,doesen't matter.

Sahaja Yogi: But I'm afraid

Shri Mataji: All right. Alright, let's - ah? Now let's do.

Djamel: There are supposed to be five different “namaaz” per day, and there is one at dawn, one somewhere when the sun is at the highest point.

Shri Mataji: So that's one you do.

Djamel: And there is one about four o'clock and one at dusk and then there is also one later on perhaps two or three hours after dusk. And each one has a certain number, what we call "rak'aht", is how many times you bow down to the ground, how many times and also it has a certain variation as to whether you should talk, say the Koran loudly or whether you should say it within your heart. Now we are not going into those details, what matters is the essence. So we gonna give, we gonna say four "rak'aht" which means we gonna bow down four times and ...

Shri Mataji: What do you do for the twelve o'clock one?

Djamel: For the twelve o'clock one we do four.

Shri Mataji: That's alright then.

Djamel: Four and ... but it develops variations as to whether we should say, talk loudly when we say the Koran. But I say we say it all loudly, because I'll be the only one saying it in Arabic. And perhaps we can have in future times...

Shri Mataji: Translation.

Djamel: ...we can have it in English especially the third account is for the exordium, which is the most basic verses of the Koran. Basically the exordium is just to say that, Oh God, You who are the King of judgment day just take me to the right path and don't let me fail from the right path, and so on. It's something like that, it's one of the most basic prayers.

Shri Mataji: You see towards Mecca when you do it.

Sahaja Yogi: Anyway you will hear me now we are going to start by calling the prayer.

Gregoire: Should I repeat Mother, because they can't hear?

Shri Mataji: No.

Gregoire: Should I shout?

Shri Mataji: No.

Gregoire: We are now going to exert the calling to prayer, the call of the prayer is told by Shri Mohammed and our brother Djamel has said there are many variations. You do it at dawn, at dusk, at noon either loudly either...

May God bless you.

Now from every center one person can come. From every country I should say. From every European country one person can come. One from Algeria. It's alright it. One from France, immediately, immediately. Do it fast!

Also give them...

From all over I hope everybody has come, from so many countries, just imagine.

Start now.

Keep it here! Alright, alright. Start it! First light the lamp. First light the lamp, then start. Where is the camphor? Start it. When you start saying... Are they very long? I am saying this because full moon night will finish. Start soon. Must start now! Getting late. Purnima should not finish, before that must start. Ha. Start.

Modi you stand and say so that everyone can hear. Otherwise sit down and say whole thing. I must hear everything. I must hear first of all. Mala, you look after this and give it to ... When it finishes you have to give it to everyone.

First smaller, smaller wood, smaller. There are smaller ones. Soak it in the ghee and then put it Soak it in the ghee.

Now put badhas (negativities) in fire and complete the havan. Do Purna Ahuti now. (Complete the offering now.) Leave all things whatever remaining to Modi. Say it (Purna Ahuti Mantra) and put in the fire. Put it in the fire. Take that rice to put in the fire. Take rice and this. Put inside otherwise it (coconut) will break and all will get hurt. You stand up and [saying] everybody can't.

Gregoire: I would like on your behalf to thank Sir Chandrika Prasad Shrivastava who has come and joined us here. For the Sahaja Yogis who are newer than others maybe very briefly we should say a few words about what we have learned from Mister Shrivastava. We live in a world where the rich and the mighty are rotten and in Mister Shrivastava we found someone who had wealth, power but much more dignity and dharma. He represents for all of us an image of fatherhood as we would like all the people in charge of this society to be and we are especially thankful not for of course what we has does for IMCO (Maritime agency of UN) but all what He has been doing for our Guru at the time when Sahaja Yoga was really faltering on the shoulders of seven rather dubious people around London. I can say so, I was one of them at the time. Sahaja Yoga was supported with an extreme generosity and extreme disponibility by Mister Shrivastava and I should say that this support has never failed and is still going on and for all this... I mean good speech is supposed to be short so I'll stop here because the topic is very inspiring. It's always a very great joy for me personally to be able to express the feelings that we feel, that we have for him and on your behalf I would like to offer him this very small present. Thank You, Sir.

Sir C.P.: Do you allow me to say something?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Sir C.P.: My dear members of this wonderful Sahaja Yoga family, My feelings are so full that I may not be able to say much. As Gregoire himself said, speeches should be short. But instead of thanking me I think I owe to you all a deep and sincere and profound debt of gratitude and I say this in all sincerity, because to me you represent that part of the world which is pure, which is good. In the world that we live in, there are many forces which are acting against goodness, against purity, against peace, against cooperation. Against mankind. In fact if you see all round there are forces of destruction almost threatening us every moment. At this time it is extremely important that there should be someone and some people who spread the message of spiritual evolution, who give to mankind hope for future. While if there is no force like that mankind itself may be at peril. It is difficult always to talk of one's own Wife, but I have to because She has been the embodiment and the soul of that Divinity, that force of goodness, which is spreading. She has given Herself totally to this, because there cannot be any compromises where Divine work is concerned. One has to be totally in it, one has to belong to it totally. I have to thank you also because you give Her such love and such affection and you fill Her with such joy.
