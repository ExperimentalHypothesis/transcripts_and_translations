Press Conference. Vienna (Austria), 7 July 1986.

Alright we are  here to inform you about a  power which is within us and  the power that can give you  what is promised by all the saints, scriptures and all the incarnations.

Today  you  see  the  young  people  in  every  country  ­especially in  the west  - you`ll find  they are  not satisfied with  their own  atmosphere, their  lives and  they think  that there  is something  missing and  they are  extremely confused. Now when they  are confused they are  seeking something beyond, something unknown  to them, in  that seeking, they may  take to anything  extreme, drugs,  could be  alcoholism, or  some other perversions which cause horrible diseases, incurable diseases.

Instead of  condemning them  we have to  see why  they are doing all these things what is  the purpose?  Some of them also went to  some gurus which  are in the market.   Especially when they see  the religious people  and the religions,  they cannot believe that religion can give such horrid experiences and some of them are anti-God, anti-religion also.  But if you deal with the problems sympathetically, you  cannot blame them, be- cause they are intelligent, aware people.   We have two categories of people, one : the ones who are not seeking at all, and another: the ones who want to find out solutions to the problems.

In  every  generation  we haul  people  who  revolutionise because they do not like a  particular system, or do not like a particular  style  of  life,  whatever   it  is,  but  now  the revolution has  to come  from within.  We  have to  evolve from within, because the destruction is also coming from within.  We are destroying ourselves  more from within.  Because  we are so unhappy,  so  confused,  absolutely  "quite  a  percentage"  is schizophrenic.   We  start seeking  the  solution  and in  that seeking we  make mistakes, we  make mistakes because we  do not know what to seek  and how to find, also how  to evolve to that state.   Logically  we  have  to  reach  some  conclusions,  to conclude that it has to be some evolutionary happening, this is logical  that to  transform  ourselves, there  has  to be  some evolution.

As Jung  has said,  you have  to become  collectively con­scious, you have  to become, it's an actualization,  it's not a certificate.  It has to come from within, it's an honest thing, it's an  innate thing.  It's  not just  preaching or sort  of a giving a  certificate, it is not,  or taking a name.   It is an actualization within  yourself, something has to  happen to us, as  we  have evolved  from  monkey  stage  to this  stage,  for example, we 've  done nothing, it's a living  process which has taken place spontaneously.

There's  a  big resistance  to  any  oriental ideas  being accepted in  the west, big resistance,  I find there is  a very big resistance to any oriental ideas coming to the west.  These oriental  ideas  which  are  coming  are  to  be  seen  with  a scientific open mind because the  western life has grown like a tree outside, the roots may be  in the east, maybe, we can keep ourselves open  to see where are  the roots?  Now if  the roots are in the east, supposing, it's  an hypothesis, so let us have a look at them,  if there is any solution in  those.  So you go to oriental  ideas.  But this  also is very  dangerous, because you are going in the unknown,  you might go to false gurus, you might go  to wrong  people and  get completely  destroyed.  So, what do we  do?  First thing we should know,  we cannot pay for our evolution, we  cannot pay, money is not there.   How can we pay for  any living process?   If the  seed has to  sprout, the Mother Earth will sprout it, we don't pay the Mother Earth.

The first thing they should have known is that anybody who asks for  money is not a  truthful person.  No money  should be involved. Then the second point comes in,  that we got to this stage of human awareness spontaneously,   without  any   effort, effortlessly.  In the same way  it should happen.  But first of all in every evolution there has  been one leader.  We can call them as  archetypes as they  say, or  whatever you may  want to say, though  Jung was  not very  clear on  that point.   Such a person can decode the information of symbols and everything and can help others,  without taking any money,  without taking any gratification, he can do it.

Here it is that people fumble in the west, they don't mind a pope, don't mind an archbishop of Canterbury, but they mind a person who is doing everything  free, just out of love.  You'll be amazed in  England, the television people told  me, that, we cannot  accept anything  which does  not take  money!  Can  you believe it, it's a fact!  In,  I think in Boston, or somewhere, they asked me  a question : How many Rolls  Royce you have got? This is journalism, I'm just telling you.

In  San   Francisco  they   would  not  even   publish  my advertisement because by  mistake we had said that  we can cure AIDS.  They said  no, we don't want AIDS to  be cured, we don't want anything  to deal with  our homosexuality.  And  they said such horrible things,  that 65 % people are  homosexuals in San Francisco.  And the editor is  a homosexual and the chairman is , even the  Mayor is so  I did'nt know  what to do.   I thought it's  better not  to advertise,  because we'll  be useless  for them.  This is what the problem is.

Then something most important which is not realized by our modern mind that  the belief that anything new is  to be tried, is very dangerous.   If we are dealing with  the living process of evolution, we  have to know that in  spiritual life whatever is  going to  happen  must  relate to  scriptures,  to all  the scriptures, it must relate to them, not to one scripture say to Holy Bible or Holy Koran, or  any, but to all of them.  Because it is like  a seed that sprouts then it  becomes the stem, then the branches, the leaves, then the flower and then the fruit; a living  process,  it's  based   on  something  evolved  through something.  But whatever is dead like  we can create a fruit, a plastic fruit from nowhere just like that you see, which has no basis, has no  meaning.  It must have a basis  from whereit has come, its  origin must be seen.   As in the growth  of the tree all that  is useless drops  out, in  the same way  in evolution also, all  that is  useless drops  out, even  useless tradition drop out,  everything drops out,  but ultimately you  reach the epitome where you  become the fruit.  So the time  has come for human beings to become the  spirit.  So every seed has "cambry" and  in the  same way  within us  is our  "camry", this  is our Kundalini.   And  this is  to  be  actually awakened,  actually awakened.  Of course the superficial people who are not worried about the  world, will  not bother  about it,  they are  out of question, superficial  people.  But there are  another type who is making money in the name  of Spirit, or living on that money and organizing, will definitely  appose us, naturally we become controversal for  them, but basically  we hit them,  through no fault of ours,  we don't mean to but it  just happens.  But the person who  has pure intelligence, he  need not be a  very well educated  person, but  pure  intelligence can  see througt  the game, should be able to see through the game.

Now in  Sahaja Yoga we  have thousands of people  all over the world.   There are people  who are -  we can call  them the highest in the society, there are  people who are the lowest in the so-called society.   All of them are on paar  with each and every person there is no higher/lower feeling, everyone belongs to that society,  belongs to that society.   Moreover when this happens because  we understand  what these  incarnations where, the conflict  of all  religions.  We  understand it  on central nervous system.  The conflict drops  out.  There is no question of not  worshipping Christ,  Muslims, Jews, Hindus  all worship Christ, they  all worship Mohammed  Sahab and they  all worship Rama, Krishna all  these.  Because actually they  see that when the Kundalini  rises, she  passes through certain  centers, and there you  have to take  the name of those  great incarnations. So this  is the knowledge of  the roots and one  must know that you  have  to  become  a   subtler  being  to  understand  that knowledge.  But unless  and until we we have  that knowledge we are in for  a catastrophe there's a big shock  awaiting us, and how are we going to avoid it?  Just by talking about peace, you don't bring peace.  Those who talk about peace, they don't have peace within themselves.  So we are  at that point where we try to talk  about it, persuade people  and the media can  help us. It has helped us  a lot in Italy, and also  in India of course, because in India people know  about the knowledge of the roots. So it is very easy in the villages of India, even in the cities of India, they are doing very  well, not only that, but say for example Delhi University has  accepted Sahaja Yoga for research and the degree  you get is doctor of  medicine-higher than post graduation, after  post graduation you  get this degree,  it is very rare  doctor of  medicine for Sahaja  Yoga, but  they have accepted.
Even  Cambridge University, they have  accepted this research.  So one should try to see the sense in it.  They have not done it to critisize it, but with respect, with acceptance, that there is something about it.  So I would request the media to give  the facts,  by understanding it,  you have  nothing to gain, but Austrian people should be benefitted, that's all.  As a result of the Kundalini awakening  you can claim many things. But that can be seen that  cancer can be cured, mental diseases can be cured, drug addiction can be cured, the problems created by these gurus can be cured.
All these things can be done when you become the Spirit, but this should  be just at a level of a hypothesis, when  we do  it, and it's  proved, then  you should accept  it; not  blindly.  There  is no  blind faith  in Sahaja Yoga.  We  have no  priesthoods, nobody is  paid.  It's  a free society,  and everyone  becomes very  knowledgeable.
A  Sahaja Yogi may not be a doctor but he can cure people.  He may not be a psychiatrist,  but  he  can  cure  mad  people.   He  becomes equipped with the  power by which he does it.   Like Christ was not a  doctor, he cured  people, in the  same way, in  the same fashion.  Now I would like you to ask questions, because it's a very wide subject and one can go on talking about it.  I wanted these people to  explain to you for fiveteen  minutes all other things.  So that you will have your questions ready for me.

Question: We've said  in the literature, any unauthorized tempering can harm  in some way your Yoga.  How  do you explain this!

Shri Mataji: Unauthorized tempering.  I mean it's written by Sahaja Yoga.

Of course, of course, you see Kundalini can only be awakened by a person who has the authority, divine authority.   You cannot elect the person, say as you  can elect a priest.  It's not  like that.  You must have the  power to raise  the Kundalini.  Now those  people who are leading  a very  one can  say dirty  life cannot  raise the Kundalini.  You  have to belong  to this pure religion,  a pure religion and  you have to  have these powers.   Otherwise those people who  try other  tricks what they  do, they  disturb your sympathetic nervous system-activity.   Kundalini does not rise. Kundalini will only rise by a proper Sahaja Yogi.  For example, I tell you, supposing there is a seed and you want to plant it. So you have  to put it in the Mother  Earth.  Supposing you put it on this table won't, but supposing you but it in the fire it will burn.  Only the Mother Earth has the power to sprout it. That's what it is.  All right.

What else?  He's done a lot  of homework, I must say, it's great and that's why you must  have read.  There are some books in German also about Kundalini,  horrible books.  That it harms you, it burns  you, nothing of that kind.  It  does not.  It is the sympathetic when activated by  wrong type of people, things like sex and other activations some people try to turn this out and  all that  and you  start seeing  the light  and all  those things, this is all short circuiting actually.  You will suffer a lot  with that,  no  doubt, it's  so  spontaneously, it  just happens to you spontaneous.   Are you feeling relaxed yourself, you got it.  You got your  realization.  Only thing is that you have to little bit know about  it, that's all.  You look really relaxed, there's no thought.  No Question.

You got it.  Just while you were talking to me you got it. Because you  are positive and  want to  know about it.   If you come with  a determined effort  just to critisize,  nothing can work out.  You got it.  May God bless you.

It's your own.   I've done nothing, I was  just talking to you.  Your Kundalini knows that you are sitting before me.  She just  knows   by  herself,  that's  your   mother.   Your  own, individual  mother,  and that's  the  Holy  Ghost.  That's  the Primordial Mother  which Christians don't talk  about, and then they don't want  you to know anything else,  whatever they will teach, you should learn, nothing more.   I was myself born in a Christian Family.  So you have to have you see blinkers on both the sides.  You are not supposed to see this side or that side. This is  why young people fell  a trap to these  horrible gurus who came to make money here.   I know of somebody who came from jail who came to Germany  wearing those saffron clothes, sat on one of the centers there somewhere and everybody locked to him. He came  from jail because  they don't know  how to make  out a good guru  - the  Sat-Guru and  the aguru  there are  books and books on that in India.  But they don't know poor things, and I don't  blame  them  because   they  were  seeking,  seeking  so honestly, that  they got  into trouble,  but I've  been talking about them  from 1974.
But  another problem with  young people from the  west was,  that they  hated Christianity,  that's one point.  So  when talked about  Christ, they just  turned round, went back.  We couldn't talk to  them.  They said don't talk of Christ, they went  out.  Ss this Christianity  has done nothing but a harm to them.  They just don't want to hear about Christ, I mean Christ is a living God, no doubt, and I've to talk about him  very  much-but they  don't  like  it,  such a  problem  of conceptions, conceptions.  You see reality is, what reality is. It's not a concept, it's what it is.
You see Christ is the son of God.  He  is the real personality whatever church  may do to it, or anyone may do to it, makes no difference.  He is what he is,and thus is what the problem is the problem is, the concept. Concept is not reality.  That's  just a mental projection, just a mental projection.   You have to  rise beyond that to  be the Spirit, all right, may God bless you.

May I  know your  name please.  George,  good.  This  is a name of an  angel, yes, St. Georg.  And St.  Georg, we call him as Bhairava  in our Indian  language, he's called  as Bhairava, St. George.   A very great  God, an Angel  . So we  have nobody else down here.   Have you any questions?  No  must be, because you have to face journalists.  What about you?  Ask a question.

Question: Where  has this message  spread in the  world, in which countries?

Sahaja Yogi: It`s  now 16 countries Shri Mataji,  in 11 of these it`s very  very active, in about 6 of  these countries we have thousands and thousands.

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course,  we have here He was in Islam religion from Algeria.  Then  of course you know him very well and  here only you'll  find people of  different religions sitting  there.   What  was   your  relgion  Mary?   Christian. There`s a lady  from a Hindu religion there  sitting.  What was your religion?   Born again (Shri Mataji  laughing) That`s some thing  all right.   We have  in all  religions, all  castes all creed.  So of  course no doubt.  We have in  all religions, all caste, all creed.
Like Sierra Leone.   We have got  Africans there, then  we have got even  in Bolivia. What is  the religion  there?  Bolivia,  Christianity, Bolivia of a kind, in Peru, everywhere.  So it is infinite.   It goes  to  everyone.  How  can  you have  anybody barred.  We  have Chinese,  Japanese.  All  types of  people we have from all races.  So there is no question of that.  So what else.  Actually I cannot give the  list of all the nations, but practically all, except for Scandanavian nations, but there are still nations we  have not approached but  we have Scandinavian people in Sahaja Yoga.  But  we haven`t yet established centers there.

Question:  What happened  in  Milan,  apparently when  you first went there.  So many people were there.

Shri Mataji: You see, I  think Italian are great sensitive people.   Italians are  very sensitive.   You`ll be  surprised, there are no gurus in Italy except in the North of Italy.  They are  very  sensitive, very  emotional  and  sensitive and  they respect love  and they  have respect for  Mother also  and when they saw  my photograph, they  did feel somethiing about  it, I don`t know  what they  felt about my  photograph, I  don`t know what photograph it was.  But they felt peace maybe, whatever it is.

But I was  amazed, the whole hall  was filled, absolutely. And Italians even as far  as their government is concerned, all of them  are very open  to Sahaja Yoga.  Surprising. They are very sensitive  people and they  must have found out  about me, that I  have done all  good.  Ther`s no objection  to anything, and now they have invited me  to a press conference which Guido will tell you what  it is, it is a press  conference of all the people of  Italy.  It`s a very  big thing, called as  the press conference "Guest of  the year".  Talking to all  of them, will be nice, will be nice, really  nice meeting them all.  Yes, but I feel Austria is one country which is very much in the center, somehow it`s very much in the center.

Austrians were  neither east or  west.  And they  are very good for Sahaja Yoga, very  sensible people in Austria.  And we have found very sensible people  in Austria, no doubt about it. Another thing is,  Austria has never given us  any problem.  We never  got people  who are  very schizophrenic,  or nonsensical fighting  type,  very  nice  people we  got.   Surprising. So Austria has a special place, I think in Europe.

Oh, something fell down, it`s all right (A picture fell from the wall).   It`s very, you know,  they are very heavy  and you have put  very small  nails, there are.   What happens  if they don`t get it.  Or if they get it.

Question: Some people get  the Kundalini raised, no doubt, what happens with people after death, if they don`t get it.  He said most religions work on a concept that you do it our way or you end up in a horrible place.  (Shri Mataji is laughing).

Shri Mataji:  No, it`s not  like that.  You see,  I think, most of the  people should get it, to get  a very generous view of the whole thing,  as the world is today it  will be taken by people, they`ll  take to realisation,  I`m sure.  Most  of them will get it.  Supposing if they don`t get and die, then they`ll be born again and they`ll get it.   But those who have to go to hell, will go  to hell anyway (Shri Mataji  is laughing again), in any  way.  You see,  there are people,  as I would  say, who would  never take  to anything  good could  be, there  could be people, I have  not known, but maybe.  We`ll should  give all a benefit of doubt.

Yes, because  you see, yes that  is it, now I'll  tell you what  happens.  Now  it is  that  your spirit  is absolute,  is absolute.  Spirit is an absolute thing.  Supposing now you want to know wether I`m good or not,  or he is good or not.  Good is not  the way  we look  at  things, like  you see  the dress  of someone, see the face, this is not the thing, it`s superficial. But when we have to see ifthe person is good or not, we see, we feel his  chakras, you see.   What chakra is catching,  you can feel them on your fingertips.  You see, like Mohammed Sahab had said, that  your hands will be  speaking.  So you feel  on your centers, the other person.  So we don`t certify them as good or bad, that catagory doesn`t exist in Sahaja Yoga.

What we  say, what are  the centers catching in  a person. Now what  is catching in a  person, what centers are  wrong, we try to correct.  We.  like a, we can say, a  patient comes to a hospital.  The  doctors don`t  say, you are  good or  bad, they don`t  catagorise like  that.  What  they  say is  what is  the disease?  Let  us treat the  disease.  It`s like that.   So the good  and  bad  is  not  discribed in  Sahaja  Yoga. What  is discribed  are the  centers which  are out  of place,  but some people have  ruined their centers completely  have no Kundalini at all with them, they are like devils.  Some of them must have been.  I don`t want to name them, but could have been.  So with such people,  what to do?   They must  have desire, I  mean you cannot force anyone, that`s the big problem.

If they desire it, well and good, if they don`t desire it, you cannot just make them do  it.  No, you cannot, They have to desire it, in their own freedom, then they get it.

The joy, nothing can be forced.  This is the handicap.  We don`t catagorise.  We don`t condemn anyone as bad, or we do not elevate somebody  as excellent, but  we tell them what  are the centers catching  and when you  get your realisation,  you will know, what  is catching in you.   And you`ll also know  what is catching in him  and then if tell you, supposing  if I tell him Dr. Warren your Agnya chakra is catching.  It means your ego is coming up.   He won`t  feel bad, because  he`ll get  a headache then, he`ll say better correct  it, Mother.  With his ego he`ll get a headache, a little bit.   It`s all right, correct it.  So nobody feels bad about it.  You see, there is nothing like good and bad,  our words used  are very  vague, they are  very vague terminologies.  There is no  precision about it, because Spirit is absolute,  so everything related  to Spirit is  the absolute knowledge.  You may  say, a person is very  good, is excellent, that we don`t accept what we accept is, what are the conditions of his chakras and how much we can help him.

Any other  question, Steve,  you better  ask me.   He`s an American.

I describe it, oh God.  Now I never had it, so how what am to  explainI do,  I`m born  like this.   But I  would say,  the experience of  self-realisation that I`ve seen  that happens to people, first of  all, when the Kundalini rises,  of course the mechanism  goes  into  complete  force, and  when  She  pierces through the fontanelle  bone area, first thing you  feel is the cool breeze in the hands, but not necessarily, some people will feel it on top of their heads, coming out as a cool breeze from their head, own head.

So the  selfcertification is there, the  cool breeze.  But could be some people have  too much heat coming out.  Supposing there  is a  cancer patient,  or anybody  like that,  a serious patient,  you find  that a  heat comes  out.  Supposing  it`s a person who is very much  posessed and extremely unhappy type of person, maybe, or an arrogant person whatever it is.

The  Kundalini you  can see  clearly with  your own  eyes, pulsating at  different centers, but  specially at the  base of the spine which  we call as the sacrum bone.   Sacrum is sacred bone, on the sacred bone.  So  you can see it very clearly.  We have got photographs of that,  absolute pulsation, you can see, like a heart.

Then the experience moves with some people it does, I must say.  They  do feel the rising,  if it`s slow rise.   But if it shoots off,  you don`t  feel anything, you  just feel  the cool breeze, coming out of your head.  Then you start feeling out of your fingertips  also.  But the  feeling you get first  of all, when  it rises  above  this  center, you  feel  you are  beyond thought.  You`re in the  present, beyond thought, just enjoying the peace,  peace of your  being.  Enjoying yourself in  a way, and then, when it pierces through a kind of a joy trickles out. Different people  have different feelings, but  say for Indians you see, they  don`t think so much as you  people think, think, think too much.  So they don`t  think, so they get there, first of all they get their joy.

But  in  the  west  the  people, I  think,  get  more  the awareness  about  it.  They  start  feeling  this chakra,  this chakra, they practise  this that, ultimately they  get the joy. But  Indians first  get  the joy  and they  say  we don`t  know anything about it.  So it depends  on the condition of a person what the experience  could be.  But on the whole,  there is one thing happens to  all of you, that your  eyes start glistening, there is a glisten, there is  a twinkel in the eye, that`s what it is.   And the face  becomes, you see, relaxed,  the wrinkels drop out, you drop out sometimes, ten years.

Like, see,  my age is 64  years of age, 64  years mine is. But people can`t believe it because you see I don`t feel my age at all.  We all have forgotten  what our ages are.  And this is

what happens  to you, because  you go  in a state  of existence only.  But takes little time, gradually to grow into it, but it starts with the  sprouting of the seed, that  is the Kundalini. But experiences  people have are  different.  Like his  case it was very  deep, I know.  Because  he was a great  seeker and he had started a band without knowing sahaj on his own, shaj-band, I don`t know  how he  started.  He  must have  got it  from the unconscious,  really.  And  he  had such  a strong  experience, because after that I me him  for about five minutes and then he went away  to Boston, and  from Boston  he sent me  a telegram, that Mother we are waiting for you in Boston.

They said "Mother, who is this  one?" I said, he is Steve, I know him very well, I`m  going down.  And they were surprised and they  said how will you  recognize, you have only  seen him for five minutes.  I said, I`ll recognize him, don`t you worry, I`m going down there.  So you  see, I can feel that also myself it within myself a person who`s  got it.  Like I told you, that you are now thoughtless.

It is  a report, of  the collective, it is  the collective report,  because  of  collective  conscoiusness  you  can  feel another  person  and  you  can  feel  yourself.   But  itis  an experience on your  central nervous system, the  thing is.  But when you  get joy and when  you get your awareness,  is a thing depending on the conditioning of a person.

Mostly  the west  people first  become aware,  more aware. They start seeing  things better, those who  have never noticed say for example, a very nice  curtain is lying here, but people will come, see supterficially, will go away.  But a Sahaja Yogi will see, what  a nice curtain, what a nice  pattern, what nice flowers, what  nice....  You  are penetration  into everything, starts   feeling   everything,   penetration  is   that.    But experiences are difficult and  different like I think everybody must write about it.  You are so many.

Sahaja Yogi:  I have  a question that  many people  ask at such conferences  is this why in  the past it was  so difficult and why today it is so easy.

Shri Mataji: That`s quite embarrasing  to ask me.  But one should reach  a conclusion, there  must be something  about me, that I do it that easily.  All right one point.  A second point could be: I  explaine it with an analogy that  in the beginning there are  very few flowers  on a tree,  very few, one  or two. Then  when the  tree  comes up  in age,  out  the blossom  time starts, there are  thousands.  So the time has  come.  Time has come and I have come, maybe that two things put together.

But maybe  I know the  trick of the tree  better, perhaps. This  is what  I have  discovered is  en-masse-realisation, not individual, but  en-masse.  That`s what I  have discovered.  If you  want me  to proclaim,  I`ll proclaim  that.  But  there is nothing  great  about  it,  I   think.   Because  If  you  have something, what is so great,  I have achieved nothing, you have achieved, that`s the point.  You have achieved, I have achieved nothing.  I  have this with  me.  You have  achieved.  Actually you must ask me some questions, You see he is a barrister.

(Question inaudible)

Shri Mataji:  Mislaid, mislaid.  How they  found different different books, that's a good  point.  Now. you see, in Sahaja Yoga you get into the essence of everything, the essence of the sap of the tree goes to every flower.  It doesn't discriminate.

But flowers  are different.  Now  what these people  have done, they have plucked these flowers.  Like somebody says this is my religion, plucked  the flowers, then  the fowers are  dead now. So they are carrying on with dead flowers.

The religions are dead now.  But they are flowering on the same tree  and you get inside  the sap, through the  roots.  So you  see,   that  everything   is  the   same.            It's   just  a

manifestation of the  same.  Now electricity is  flowing, it is working  out there,  but electricity  is the  same because  you become the  essence.  But  if you see  from outside,  they look different.

Specially  when deliberately  they will  have plucked  out these flowers  and established  this is  mine, Christ  is mine, how?  Islam is mine, how?  It  is not.  You cannot have them as proper, these.   They cannot  be your  properties.  So  this is what you realize and that's what you see that everything is the same, you  see now you have  become an essence, your  eyes have opened out,  you see that  everything is the same.   You cannot become fanatic now, you cannot.  Even if you try to, you cannot (Shri Mataji is laughing).  You  just cannot become fanatic any more because  you see, the essence  is the same.  I  mean sugar put into this,  sugar put into that.  If you  become the sugar, you are  in everything, isn't  it?  I  mean religion had  to be little different  in its form,  because of the times  that were there.  Times were this way, that way, you see every time, They had no  change the  outward form and  things like  that, social level,  policitcal  level, this,  that.   But  essence was  the same.

(Question inaudible)

Of course.  You  can't have it any more,  that's very true because you  see the essence  is the same.  You  see fanaticism comes  from word  "finite" we  should  say.  When  you go  into infinity , how  can you have fanaticism?   You finite yourself, I'm this, I'm  this.  That is clubbing, actually  it is nothing but ordinary clubbing, you see.  We have clubbed, like somebody puts the , say  the table-ware on the left side  - is one club. They put  it on the  right side another, then  they distribute, you see,  that's just  like stupid  clubbing, that's  all.  You cannot club God or Christ or anyone of these incarnations, they are all brohters and sisters and relations of each other.  They are all related to each other.

But those  people, who  were in  charge, tried  to destroy them , as soon as possible,  take the charge.  Christ lived for four years, how Mohamedza lived  you know, everyone of them how they were  tortured, that's what happened,  because they wanted to take  advantage of them.   But forgive them now,  all right, some day they will come round.  And now question from you?

Question  inaudible: How  could  you reach  the people  in communistic countries?

Hungary. In a way they are better of,  I tell you.  I've been to Russia, I've been to  Chezeslovakia, I know they are not  free, but you see, freedom one should be able  to bear it.  What is happening to the free  countries, if you see them, horrid.   If you go to America, you can't wear your  watch or bangles.  Maybe tomorrow they will  pull out your  hair also.  Such an  idiotic country. So this freedom also human beings cannot bear, in a way, as far as these unfree  countries are now.  I tell you  the people are so simple.   I went to  China, I went  to Russia because  of my husband's job,  people are  extremely simple,  the governements are all  so horrid.  But  it will take  no time for  you ignite Sahaga Yoga, no doubt.

Actually it  is already  done there  in a  way.  Logically they are understanding  it now what Sahaja Yoga is.  so it will come  to Russia,  it  will  come to  China,  from these  bigger countries.  But  what about  the free  countries first  of all, tell  me about  them (Shri  Mataji is  laughing).  Free  it's a licence.

It's great because  we have people of  that quality.  What we need is a transformation of human beings.  Hypocrits talk of big, big things,  cannot achieve anything in  Sahaja Yoga.  But the  people who  believe, not  believe  but know  as an  actual thing, that we are part and parcel of the whole, will not think that of  one government,  another government, they'll  think of one world, the  whole.  All this so called  politics is because we are  divided, the nose  is fighting, the eyes  are fighting, the ears.   And when  they discover  we are  one body,  what is there  to fight?   So most  of  the politics  will be  disolved completely , as it  is now.  Look at us, we  have powers, so we are capitalists  and we want  to give it  to others; so  we are communists  already, we  want to  share  it, we  don't want  to conserve it.

So we are  alredy doing the right  thing, the integration, so all these  problems come out of human beings  and as soon as they become  the Spirit,  the problems  will be  disolved.  The social problems, you see we  have already solved so many social problems  in Sahaja  Yoga.  You  don't have  problems that  you normally see,  our children  are great,  our marriages,  we are enjoying  our lives,  it's heavenly.   One or  two mishaps  are there, doesn't matter, but mostly  we have a beautiful society, no quarrel, no  jealousies, no fighting, no  malice, no hatred, nothing.   Isn't  it  great  to  have such  a  society  and  no dictation, nothing, absolutely free.

Question inaudible.   Well, what can  I do about  it.  Some think no  end of  themselves, some  are very  superficial, some themselves think they don't need  anything, all kinds they are, I know, I agree with you, but it happens.

They say that  the advertising done by  the Sahaja Yogis sounds like an advertisement for instant coffee.

Shri Mataji: It  is instant coffee.  But what  to do?  You see, I  tell you,  you buy  instant coffee,  isn't it. Now in modern times  everything is  instant, so  we have  instant Yoga also.  It is, what to do.  It  is, but you see now, you can say that  you get  it after  a lot  of sufferings  and you  have to sacrifice this  and sacrifice  that, all right,  but it  is not true.  Now,  what to do?   It is  instant coffee.  But  we take instant coffee, we want everything to be instant in this modern time, why not Yoga?

Question  inaudible.(The interviewers  cannot be  heard on the tape.)

Shri Mataji: So you tell  us now how to advertise,...  You see that what I'm saying, that's  a fact, I really tell, that's a fact.  The  Kundalini I call  it the jet-Kundalini  in modern times,  really I'm  myself surprised  that it's  worked -  just shoots off, you know.  Thousands of people in India, thousands. What am  I to  do, it works  like that, I  think the  Divine is anxious, that let's have it now.   It is.  In modern times it's
working very  fast.  Not only me,  ask him, how many  people he has given realization, everyone of  them has given to thousands realization.  I  mean, seeing is believing,  . But advertising, we don't know what to say now.

Sahaha Yogi: Perhaps  the English  word  is  a little  bit slick, a little  smart, something like that.   Perhaps you mean more profound, more deep.  It's sounding like the other guru.

Shri Mataji: I  don't know  about other  gurus what  they like.  Abut why  don't you see to it what  you should....  I've no idea.

Sahaja Yogi: It's written that  the time has come the true realization here and now.

Shri Mataji:  So what should  we see, what should  we say. Here and  now it is  a fact.  I tell  you.  Now what  should we say.  All right, is true.  But what I'm saying for people to be attracted.  What  he is  saying that when  you have  to attract people from outside then we should  just , try to change it.  I don't know what.

Sahaja Yogi repeats  the question: Is there a  certain type, is there  a stage  when you  come  to Sahaja  Yoga or  is it  that everybody should  be brought in right  now.  Or do you  reach a state  in  your   awareness,  where  you  just   come,  if  the advertising department is good or not.

Shri Mataji: I  just don't know what to say  on this point because, you cannot  say certainly that people have  to reach a certain stage, because  a person you see, his  wife brought him saying , he is the worst man, indulges into this, indulges into that  and all  kinds  of things,  bad  certificates about  that fellow and as soon as he came in, he got his realization.  This is really true,  I tell you.  People are  suffering from cancer got realization in  no time.  What is the stage,  I don't know. But  maybe we  can say  the attitude  towards life.   Maybe the attitude towards life.  Say, for  example, in the West.  I like these BBC people telling me, that if you say that it is without money, nobody  will listen to you.   But I can't say  it is for money.  That's one point.

He  said, when  you  say free  admission,  he thinks  it's useless.   The conditioning  is so  bad, that  if you  say free admission, he  says "Oh, it  must be something  funny!" (Sahaja Yogi: he said it's the Anglo-Saxon brain.)

Shri  Mataji: This  is  what he  said:  Anglo Saxon  brain cannot understand anything without  money, can you imagine.  He told me frankly.  He said, when  you change this.  I said, what should I say, I really don't take  any money, what am I to say. This is what  it is.  You see, this is  the conditioning of the mind.

In  India it  is not  so.  In  India if  you see  from the villages they'll  come on  mula-bullock-carts, they  come miles togehter they'll walk,  when they know, I'm  going there.  Also the knowledge  is not  here.  They have  no background,  what I would say.   A background is needed  or I don't know.   But the sensitivity is there . The Italians did not have the background but sensitivity is there. sensitivity is there.

Worst is in,  I would say, in Switzerland  or America.  It is the worst  of all.  America felt for all  kinds of gurus but for Sahaja Yoga very bad.  I'm sorry.  That's hour it is.  They don't look at Sahaja Yoga.  Now they are, after they've had all the experience  of all the  guru shopping, they did.   Now they are  coming.  They  want  to  do shopping,  you  know.  It's  a fashion.   Guru  is  a  fashion.  It's  nothing  deep,  it's  a fashion.  Going  to this guru,  that guru.   So how to  talk to them.  They have money.  They want to shop it.

America was the worst of all, I must say, experience wise, supposed to be  the most advanced, most free  country.  The are the  worst of  all.  But  in Austria  I've seen  the halls  are filled, they are full.  In Austria  we always get the halls are completely filled.  Just like also in Italy.  I mean the people have to sit on the stairs  in Austria, isn't it?  We don't have that  problem.  But  getting  realization is  not possible  for everyone - perhaps.

There's  some sort  of an  understanding needed. I can't explain why.  Because the house is  all full, I tell  you.  You see  in the  halls are  absolutely filled.   People sit  on the stairs, you see some are  sitting outside, some are standing on the street.  It's there despite the fact they are Saxon brains, he says.  Did you write free?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Yes, that's it.  They'll come around, gradually they will. See they have to learn their  lessons a little bit more, that's all.  Now you, with you I tell  you why. Because you are in the UN a big boss there, working in the UN itself spoils your head, I tell you.   I know, my  husband is there.   So I know  all of them and  their heads get  swollen up for see,  UN personality. Then you are attending big conferences, you see, so called big, big people  you see, big heads  you meet.  Naturally to  be the big head,  these things do not  go in.  So it's  all right, but now   you   are   all   right.    That   is   one   thing,   UN people-bureaucrats are the worst of all.  They will be the last to come to Sahaja Yoga.  My  husband is a bureaucrat and I hare to deal with them, I never talk about Sahaja Yoga never, never, never...

Bureaucrats they  only want  to serve  governement, that's all.  They don't understand anything beyond.  So bureaucracy is like that.   Now what  else you  have in  Austria: Bureaucracy, then you have military.  Students, they will come.

Question inaudible: Why should people worship you?

Shri  Mataji: There's  no need  at all.   I would  be very happy if  they don't worship. But you see, those  who worship me,  have found  something good  out  of it.   That's why  they workship me.  But you know, actually I hate that.  I always see to it, that these pooja should  be so much lengthy, that I have some time to rest.  But I don't want them to worship me at all, it's very good,  that's very good of them.  I  tell you some of them, when they touch my feet, I get blisters.  Horrible!

As if yesterday.  I was telling you like scorpions.  I get such  big, big  blisters  on my  feet.  I  don't  want them  to worship me,  if you ask me.   But they would like  to.  Because you know what  it means, worshipping me.  You all  know it very well.  Worshipping what do you give me - nothing.  You just say certain mantras,  this, that.  What  do you give me  - nothing. There is nothing to worship me.

For example, now,  see my photograph, this one,  is when I was sitting in  a village.  When I entered the  village, I told them there  is a  very great  soul who  lived in  this village. They said there  was one, he was a Muslim,  his name was "Mia". so I said, now he must have been still here.  And I sat down to give my lecture and  I saw the Spirit coming as  a light of two ...hexagons you see on top of my head, I saw it.  But you can't see it.  I mean, people can't see.

But camera captured it.  The camera captured it.  And then the sun's rays through that  prism - like Spirit started coming as all seven colours on me.  I could see it.  I could see, then I was  very happy  with it,  you  see, with  this report.   But nobody could  see it.  Then I  said, all right, it's  more than one's sense of  reception, like that?, I said.   But nobody can see it now, so what's the use of my telling them you should see because you  will not  see.  So  why to  tell anybody  about my worshipping  also, till  they  understand it.   But the  camera caught it, what can I do?  Thank God, the camera caught it. I didn't say.

Why do they worship Christ?  They've never seen Him.  Why do they worship Christ's Mother.  They've never seen Her.  What did She do,  She was just crying all Her  life, She didn't give realization to anybody, even  Christ didn't give realization to anyone.  So, why do they worship Him?  You are a Christian, you should  ask them  a question  like  that.  Why  do the  Muslims worship Kaba?

But in Sahaja Yoga I'm a discovery for you.  I never asked anyone  to  worship me,  never.   It's  horrible for  me.   I'm frightened of  people trying  to worship  me because,  you see, I've to take up everything, to suck in everything of you.  They can tell you, that I just don't  like it.  I want to make a big gaps inbetween, so  at least I have some time  to rest, to suck in the whole thing, digest it and take it out.  So you need not tell them  at all.  In the  beginning you should not  tell them anything.  Tell them  that you are great, come  along: Let them have  their realization.   Then  if they  say,  then we  should consider, whether they  should worship me or  not and everybody is not allowed to          worship also.

Do you  know that Mary,  that we don't allow  everybody to come?  You  have to be a  clean person, otherwise they  are not allowed.  So this  worship is your privilege, not  mine, by any chance ,  I tell you.   By any chance.   At which you  will all say, that Mother shuns it, I really shun it.  These false gurus because nothing  happens to them,  they lit it.  So  there's no explanation for this.  It is to  be seen.  Even if they come to Sahaja Yoga they  can see it very well.  Unless  and until they come  in  it,  you  should  not  talk  of  me  as  anything  as incarnation, anything,  just don't  talk.  You should  not tell them of worship  or anything.  Just tell them that  you have to get your  realization.  Let  them first  open their  eyes, then talk  to them  about  this. In the  beginning,  if you  start talking,  they'll be  stuck no  doubt, they  are stuck  because they've not reached that point.  They have to be sea-worthy, to be in the sea, isn't it?

Nothing is  needed to  begin with  actually.  And  I don't want  anything, really.   If there  is anything  that is  to be done, is to  give realization to everyone, that's  all.  But to progress further, they  have to worship me.   They will worship somebody who  is dead and  gone.  They never  worshipped Christ

when  He lived.   They  never worshipped  His  Mother when  She lived.   They  never  worshipped Rama,  they  never  worshipped Krishna.  Now  when they are  dead, very nice to  worship.  But they are stones now, what can they do?

That's human nature.  When  somebody is dead, then perfect joy.  The ones who crucified Christ have raised these churches. When  a  person  lives,  you  see in  the  present,  you  never appreciate.   Because we  don't allow  anyone to  worship also. It's a  very great privilege for  anyone to be there,  you know that.  It's not for everyone.   So many people have been denied in  England  and  all  that.   Just now  you  have  to  prepare yourself, oh no, no, no.  Everywhere.

And yesterday I was telling Guido that you should not have brought  that lady,  she was  no good.   The one  who was  your room-maid  who was  pestering you.   And  I said  she was  very caught up  and you  should have  not been  brought here  to the pooja.  That  disturbs me.  It's  very significant, but  like a person  who  has to  be  post-graduate  student, to  understand certain things.  You have to  be a post-graduate in Sahaja Yoga to be  in a worship.  Otherwise  you should not.  So  you don't talk of these things.  They'll  get stuck, no doubt.  When I've no doubts about it.

Anybody would get stuck, because  it looks so funny, isn't it, that you worship another human being.  It is.  It's more to use discretion.   Anybody would be  stuck that way,  unless and until you are  a first-class Sahja Yogi and  you understand the value of  it, and  you have  gone deep into  it, then  only you realise.

It is to  be appreciated.  I never talked about  me at all to anyone.  Never.  Till some  saints started talking about me. Some saints  only told  some people, that  this is  this.  Then they came  and asked me and  I said allright, you  find out for yourself.  You see with human beings  you have to be very, very careful and cautious.  I do not want to get crucified, you see. You have to be very very cautious with them, because ego is the first thing they come with.

They don`t  understand what  is beneficial for  them.  You see what did  Christ do to them.   Did he ruin them,  or do any bad  to them.   But they  crucified him,  isn`t it. They gave poison to  Mohammed Sahab.  Why?  What was the  thing?  Because ego, so  you should be careful  with it.  Even when  you write, supposing  in your  wherever  you write,  you  should write  it cautiously.    Make  it   so,  that   according  to your  own understanding,  that  they  come  to my  programme. Use  your wisdom.

What you want to put it, how to put it.  Or if you want to say,  you can  say, that  at the  first instance  the Kundalini rises and then you have to grow  into it.  If you don`t want to say it  quick, instant-coffee- business.            So you may  say like this.   That  might  look  nice.  I  would  suggest  that  way, allright?  That would help.  But  with the people, some of them are very  deep people,  they just get  realisation in  no time. Because they have been deep  people all their lives.  Not life, but lives.  So they just get it.

So it attracts  people who are superficial,  then it`s a good thing  to say.  That may  be one of the  reasons that only superficials come to our programme.  We should find out what to write  that the  deep  people are  attracted.   Isn`t it.   You should find out  ways and methods by deep  people are attracted not superficial.

I agree with  you, the hall gets filled  up, because maybe superficial.  Like a sale-on. Nobody buys anything, it`s just a sale  on.  Everybody  comes to  see the  sale.  (Shri  Mataji laughing)  This is  Kali Yuga,  you see.   The confused  state. This is  the age of confusion.   This is the age  of confusion, real confusion.

Also some people say, that  why should I give realisation. I said  better you  give,  very  good idea. I  would like  to retire.  You see this is ego,  isn`t it.  Why should you do it. I mean I`m doing it, because I have to do it, allright.  But if you can  do it, nothing like  it, I'll retire.  I  will be very happy.  I  mean my age  is beyond  now retiring.  I  would have retired  long time  back.  See  going  on and  on (Shri  Mataji laoughing).  So  also you should  see the people who  they are, and  then  talk  to  them.    You  must  use  discretion,  very important.  To use  discretion.  As he said,  maybe some people may not  get it  in this  liftime.  Maybe  next time.   Also it happens  that you  see, some  people get  realisation, say  for example  and   get  transformed   and  become   something  very beautiful.

Then the mediocres, the mediocre  people, you see, may see that and try to follow it.   The mediocre may try to follow it. Like when I  went to Italy this gentleman who  is a very famous person  who  interviewed  me. He   said  first  you  give  me realisation, then I'll interview.   Because perhaps he believed in me whatever it was, or may not have believed, might be doubt whatever  it  is, he  got  his  realisation.  Then  he  started laughing and  he said,  Oh, so  I`ve got it  now.  I  said yes, you`ve got it.

Now it is  he who is organising all this.   So may be like this it might  forcome.  Depends on, you see,  human beings are quite complicated in modern times, very difficult to hold on to them.  If you  should give them this, they will  come this way. If you give them that, they'll  come this way.  Just they don`t want to have it.  Just some books or excuses, it`s terrible.  I know.   Specially  in  the  west, It`s  very  difficult.   Very difficult.  But they`ll accept something stupid, like punks.

Punks you  will find thousands  now.  People in  very high positions  are punks  now,  can you  believe  it!  Imagine  our prime-minister  going as  a  punk.  They  accept stupid  things without  any questioning.   Think  of it.   Drugs for  example. They accept  it without  any understanding, without  any asking and very  educated highly placed  people do it.   Absurd things like that.  Alcoholism, womanizing, everything, all nonsensical things.

But to do something good to yourself, it takes time.  They are very self-destructive by temperament.  To do something nice to ourselves, to get some blessings upon ourselves we are slow. But it  will be  allright.  They have  to learn  their lessons, that`s all I think.  Yes, they have to learn their lessons.

Everyone satisfied?

May God bless you.

I`m happy  that he is  a very wise  man.  He has  done the homework.  The  other people  just came,  just like  any... you see, that  won`t work out.  It`s  a very deep subject.   It`s a very deep subject.   You cannot just appear and  go out.  Isn`t it.   Steve are  you  going to  talk to  some  people there  in Boston.  In this way.  Yes in this way.  Really?  Good, good.

Sahaja  Yogi:  All over  the  world  we get  thousands  of people, we get big press conferences.

Shri  Mataji:  Australia  are  very  good,  Australia  are extremely good.   Maybe we  get superficial things.   Could be. So we should  put something deep in it, because  it`s very deep experience.  It`s  suggestion you  see will be  something which explains  certain things. They  like my  lectures all  right. They like to listen to my lectures, because you see, it appears on their mind, but they  dont`t get realisation.  So that means they are not very deep people. For  example  in  Switzerland,  we put  these  things.   Nobody removed it.  It's still there.   After three years it is there. It`s  very  surprising  in  Switzerland  where  people  are  so meticular.  They have kept my photographs.  In Italy also.  All my three year  old photographs are there.  Italy.   So Italy is there.

Also  I must  say that  advertising, whatever  it was,  in Australia.
Australia   is  dynamic  absolutely. It`s  very progressing in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.  Australians imagine, can you believe it that they were sent there as criminals, by their forefathers, and today  they are the one`s to  take everyone to Spirituality.  Look at that.  So how  can you say good and bad? You cant` talk of good and bad!

Australia is the best.  Australia is the best now.  I mean in progress.   We have the  leader from Australia,  Dr. Warren, who started  the whole thing and  we have James.  Has  he come? Oh, that`s James.

May God bless you!  May God bless you!
