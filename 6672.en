Public Program. Vienna (Austria), 19 June 1990.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

Yesterday I told you that we have to know the absolute truth. Absolute truth is the truth which cannot be challenged and cannot have a second opinion. But the giver of this absolute truth is the Spirit. The Spirit resides in your heart. Before Realization your Spirit is a witness of what you are doing. But after Realization the energy of Kundalini ignites the flame of Spirit in such a manner that your attention gets enlightened.
So the Spirit is the source of light. Not this light that burns, but the light that soothes. The Spirit is the collective being within us. It is like a reflection of the Sun in different places, specially in the lakes where you can see it clearly, the God Almighty is reflected in all of us. He is reflected in everything that is being created. But the reflectors are very poor, some of them are just like stones. Only in a saint reflection of God is clear, because it is the reflection of one God Almighty, it is in everybody and so it is the collective being.
So after Realization you can feel another person on your fingertips and you can feel yourself also on your fingertips. You can ask any question, like a computer the answer comes, yes or no, by means of vibrations. Once you are realized, once you are connected with the Divine power it starts acting through your nervous system. Spirit is the source of peace. So such a person becomes peaceful and he becomes thoughtlessly aware. Whenever he wants he can think and if he does not want he need not think. So there is no tension on such a person. So we see that the Spirit is the source of all the knowledge. When the Spirit enlightens your brain you become exceptionally intelligent and absorbent, because it does not react, it absorbs.

Also Spirit is the source of enlightened attention. In the sense that the attention is enlightened and when you pay attention to someone the Spirit - which is the light in the attention - acts. For example you pay attention to a sick person then the sick person gets cured. We could say like this that the, we see a television and in the television we see lots of pictures, but they do not act. But the attention which is enlightened, when is extended or put on anyone, the vibrations from that attention act. That is why after Sahaja Yoga we have to purify our attention. With this light you start definitely improving your attention. In the West the attention is very superficial because there are so many choices created. All the time we are choosing with our eyes. Even when we are married, we are looking at every woman, every man with our eyes, which is of no use, it's a joyless pursuit. Many people think it's freedom. But it is abandonment. With this abandonment we develop an eye which Christ has described as adulterous. He has very clearly said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." So there is no purity in the eye. And it's so unnatural because it creates jealousy, hatred and very unnatural behaviour. And also the cunning comes out of it. I think it is quite a modern disease. Because we don't see much of this in India and places, primitive places. It's only in the westernized, advanced places you find this kind of attention, going like that all the time. And that is why I think the schizophrenia is very common in the West. In America they are saying that very soon there will be 60 percent people schizophrenic. There is no rest to our attention. But after Realization the eyes start becoming pure and concentrated. They become steady. And such pure eyes are the ones - even a glance of such an eye can be so much redeeming. It just automatically sometimes works. When the Kundalini passes through your Agnya and the Christ is awakened in your Agnya chakra, the eyes become steady and peaceful.

Above all the Spirit is the source of joy. It is not happiness and unhappiness. Joy is not duality, joy is singular. If you see so many people who preach religion are unnecessarily so serious, there is no need to be that serious. Sometimes they grow big beard, big moustache, big hair to show that they are very serious people. (Laughter) And they never smile, even smile, you know laughing is different. That's an absurd idea. A spiritual person has to be bubbling with joy. This is all the play of the Divine, you see. You just see how things are working out and you just laugh at it. Mostly the seriousness is because of people who are either cruel or tortured by cruel people, but spiritual people never suffer. It may appear that they suffer but Spirit cannot suffer. It is beyond suffering. It enjoys everything in its proper perspective. This joy fulfils our lives and the lives of all other people. So then - who is the other? You can feel everybody on your being, and you can feel yourself - so, who is the other?

But a Realized Soul is a detached personality. He doesn't say 'my children, my house'. But he says 'our children, our house'. He shares all the time. I would say like this, now supposing I have all the powers then I am a capitalist. But I cannot live without distributing it and sharing with you, so I'm a communist. So a person who is a Realized Soul is the one who lives collectively and only enjoys collectivity. But at the same time he is detached. Like a sap in the tree rises, goes to the various parts of the tree, gives sap to the leaves, flowers, fruits, everything and comes back. But if it gets attached to some flower then that flower will die in any case, because the tree will die. So, attachment is the death of love. The love you feel for somebody should be just giving love, not to expect anything out of that. You just enjoy giving.

Like yesterday you saw so many people were sick. I'm surprised in a western country where you are so advanced there are so many sick people. I was quite shocked. While in India we don't have proper sanitation, proper food and when I go to villages we have thousands of people, ten times more then you are here, but we seldom find anybody sick there. Because they live in natural surroundings, in a natural way and enjoy their natural life. But that doesn't mean that we should becoming primitive like hippies. Only by growing hippie-like hair your brain, which is modern cannot be changed. So what you need is the transformation within. And that transformation is only possible when there is the light of the Spirit. Without that transformation you cannot achieve that state of peace and joy. So this is the last breakthrough of our awareness, where we have to jump into a new Awareness of a Realized Soul.

Now the modern Sahaja Yoga is so simple that people cannot believe it that you can get it - sitting on your chair in Austria without going to Himalayas - your Realization. But this is a Blossomtime and there are so many seekers - it has to work this way. This transformation is the most important thing in these modern times. Only the wise can understand that this is the most crucial time we are facing. And once you find your Soul, you find your Spirit - then you want that everybody should find it. Like a drunkard always wants to share his drinking with others. (Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter) But this drinking doesn't give you hangover. But you are elevated and relaxed. All the time full of energy and creativity. And living in the beautiful atmosphere of such beauty and such purity that we cannot imagine.

Now Sahaja Yoga is working in 40 nations. People of different religion, culture, races, all kinds of people are there. But such purity in the hearts of Sahaja Yogis that there is no complication of any woman running with another man or anything like that, nothing of the kind. It's remarkable that there's no fight, no argument, nothing. And they know each other so well. Only if they have to find out if another one is a Sahaja Yogi - just have to feel the vibrations, that's all. And there are so many beautiful stories how some unknown Sahaja Yogis from some place met another one from some other place and how their meeting took place so beautifully. For example, the role of life and the identity of personality changes completely. Even the priorities change. For example today you are sitting before Me asking for Self Realization but tomorrow you come here and give Self Realization to others. Today you are coming to ask Me that you want, you are sick and you want to cured, tomorrow you cure others. So a person who is a Realized Soul himself becomes a source of peace and joy.

This is the right time for us to take the decision. If we miss this time we are lost. So I am so very happy in Austria there are so many people who are aware. As a result of Realization your health will be perfect. Gradually it improves. All the Sahaja Yogis say, "We never take any medicines, we don't go to any doctors, nothing of the kind." Then mentally you are at peace, you don't quarrel, you don't fight. And you become just a witness of the whole play. You become extremely patient. And enjoy the enjoyment of others. I have seen in the West specially that if there is a music program going on the neighbours will complain to the police. But let's say in India there is a music program, the neighbours will bring tea and snacks and come and enjoy the music. (Laughter) And they think it is a free entertainment, just imagine, why not have it?

So this sharing of joy and sharing of love, sharing of children, sharing of flowers, sharing of all that is beautiful, it's so natural, which comes to us after our Realization. Thus we enter into the Kingdom of God. And the Kingdom of God is the most efficient kingdom you could think of. It looks after every details of yours. Every small needs are looked after, you call them miracles, but you don't know the miracle is that you are now in the Kingdom of God. Not only on physical level but also on material level it looks after you every moment. All the time you feel you are hitting a jackpot every moment. (Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter) And you are so filled, you're so filled with the blessings that you don't know what to do. It's such a beautiful life. I wish all of you will have it and enjoy it, it is just at your doorsteps.

So I think we should have the session of Self Realization, because yesterday nobody asked any questions and today there are no questions either.

Some of you are still sick and if you can come to Sahaja Yoga I am sure gradually you'll all improve in health. You must have little patience with yourself. That's all is needed. And everything will work out. Allow this Divine power to do everything. You surrender your ego to this Divine power and it takes over. And you'll be amazed how your problems are solved. Yesterday only one lady came and told Me she had cancer and now she is cured. I'm not surprised. But it's difficult for people to believe that they are born in an era, which is just on the borderline of the Golden Age. Also they think that, "What have we done to achieve this?" Have faith in yourself. Have faith in yourself. You have come here because you are something. So I just want you to have faith in yourself and everything will work out.

May God bless you all!

So now, if you agree we'll have the session of Realization. I have to say at the very outset that I cannot force on you Self Realization. And so those who do not want Self Realization should leave the hall. That would be very kind. And also you should not look at other people but work it out for yourself. Because now the time is there for you to look at yourself. And you will know how beautiful you are, how glorified. It's like this, if you take a television set in a remote village of India and tell them that you can see all kinds of pictures, they will never believe. But when you put the connection to the mains, they will see the films and they'll think, "Look at this, it was just a little box and how wonderful is this world." In the same way you do not know about yourself. But once you get your Realization and you start using your powers you'll be amazed how great you are. And how much you have within yourself of which you were never aware.

I have to make a humble request that we'll have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth also helps us.

You should have no fears at all. Kundalini is your individual Mother. She is the power of pure desire. And the pure desire is to become one with the Divine. She is not going to trouble you at all. As your mother took all the pains upon herself when she created you or she gave you birth, in the same way this Kundalini looks after you.

So you have to understand that there is a left side and a right side, there are two powers. So, we have to put our both the feet apart from each other. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right, they shouldn't worry. Now, we have to use both our hands in such a manner that we use left hand like this - symbolizing our desire to have Self Realization. And we use the right hand in such a manner that it's an action to nourish our centers on the left hand side. But before anything else I must tell you that there are two conditions you have to fulfil, which are very important. The first condition is that you are not to think of your past at this moment, but of the present. That means you forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you might have committed and don't feel guilty at all. So, not to feel guilty for the past that is very important. It's a very important thing because it catches - if you feel guilty - at this center here on the left side, left Vishuddhi and it's difficult for Kundalini to rise. But otherwise also you can develop diseases like angina and also spondylitis with feeling guilty. Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. To forgive everyone because it is a myth whether you forgive or don't forgive. Whether you forgive or don't forgive you do not do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. The most constricted center in your central path is the Agnya on the optic chiasma. And it is completely constricted like this in a cross. Unless and until you forgive it won't open out like that for the Kundalini to pass. Yesterday so many people did not feel because they did not forgive, and I had to work on them, "Forgive, forgive, forgive," then they felt it. Are we going to miss our Self Realization because we want to play into the wrong hands? So today I request you again and again, please forgive everyone in general, not to think in particular.

All right, so now you have to be placed towards yourself very pleasantly. And must have faith and self confidence in yourself that you are going to get your Self Realization and that you are going to get it in a big way. So now, please put your left hand towards Me like this - symbolizing your desire to get Self Realization. Open it out fully. And now we have to use the right hand to give nourishment to our centers, but we work it only on the left hand side. So, first we'll show you how to do it and then you'll have to close your eyes and then the Kundalini awakening will take place. So now, first of all we have to put left hand towards Me like this and right hand on our heart. Here resides the Spirit. Then we bring our right hand on the left hand side in the upper part of our abdomen and press it hard. Now, this is the center of our mastery.

Now we take down our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen and press it hard. This is the center of pure knowledge. This pure knowledge manifests on your central nervous system. Now we take back our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. Then we take our right hand on our heart. Now we take our right hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder and put it as back as possible. And turn your head to your right. This is the center catches when you feel guilty. Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head and press it on both the sides. Now please remember that this is the center to forgive everyone in general. Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head and slowly push back your head as far as possible. And here for your own satisfaction, without counting your mistakes and your so-called sins you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine Power.

Now stretch your hand fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now this is very important. So put down your head and stretch your fingers as far as possible backwards so there's a very good pressure on your scalp. Put down your head properly and press it hard and push back your fingers. Now here you have to move your scalp, slowly - scalp, not your hands, scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

Now that's all we have to do.

Now, please close your eyes. Those who are sitting on a chair please keep both your feet apart from each other. Now please put the left hand towards Me on your lap. And right hand on the heart. Now please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

Now here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, you may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother. You can ask the question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

Now if you are the Spirit you are your master, you are your guru, you are your guide. So now take down your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here now you have to ask another question, "Mother, am I my own master?" Three times.

I've already told you that I cannot force anything on you and I respect your freedom. So I cannot force Self Realization on you. So now please take your hand down into the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So please ask seven times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Say it six times because this center has got six petals.

As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts moving upward. So we have to nourish the higher centers with our self confidence. So now raise your right hand and put it in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Now here with full confidence please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

I've already told you that the greatest truth about you is that you are not this body, you are not this mind. You are not these emotions and you are not these conditionings and you are not this ego. But you are pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart. And here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

The Divine Power is the source of knowledge. It is the source of joy and Ocean of Blessings. It is the Ocean of Love and Compassion. But above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you commit can be dissolved completely by this great power of forgiveness. So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, take it as far back as you could. Now turn your head to your right. And here you have to say with full confidence 16 times, please believe what I say, 16 times, "Mother, I'm not guilty at all."

I've already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So it is a myth that you cannot forgive. So now raise your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head and press it on both the sides. Now here say it with full confidence, "Mother, I forgive everyone." From your heart - not how many times.

Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push your head on it as far as possible upward. Here for your satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to say, "Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes please forgive me." Also say it from your heart - not how many times.

Now stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now press your scalp well by pushing out your fingers. And please bend your head as much as possible. Now, here again I cannot cross over your freedom and cannot force Self Realization on you. So now move your right hand with a great pressure on your scalp. So in such a manner that you move the scalp slowly clockwise seven times saying, "Mother, please give me my Self Realization." Push back your fingers, push back your fingers, put a proper pressure first.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into the microphone)

Now please take down your hands and open your eyes. Now put the right hand towards Me like this, and bend your head and put the left hand on top to see if there's a Cool Breeze coming out. Don't keep it on top of your head, but away - sometimes you get it very much away. And sometimes you get heat coming - doesn't matter.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me and the right hand, you bend your head again and see if with your right hand if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head, even if there's a hot Breeze - doesn't matter. See if there is Cool Breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

Now again put your right hand towards Me, bend your head and see for yourself if there's a Cool Breeze coming out of your head. See it with your left hand.

Now raise both your hands, put your hands up towards the sky and put your head towards the sky. And ask anyone of these questions three times, "Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the All pervading power of Divine Love? Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions three times. Don't doubt that, if there's a Cool Breeze coming, don't doubt that it is air-conditioning and all that, suddenly how can it be?

Now take down your hands please. Put your hands towards Me like this. Take down your hands. Put both your hands towards Me like this. And don't think - you can do it. You have reached the state of thoughtless awareness. All those who have felt the Cool Breeze or hot Breeze out of their fontanel bone area or on their fingertips or on their hands please raise your both the hands. Those who have felt please raise them higher, I would like to see. Practically I think everybody has felt. (Shri Mataji laughing) So I bow to all the saints of Austria.

Now you have felt it, but you must know how to use it. you must know all about it, don't waste it. Whenever I come there are lots of people, but once I go they do not go to the follow on and develop themselves. You have faith in Me but I say, "Have faith in yourself." You all can become like Me. Work it out, we have to transform this world. It is the most important thing today. And you all also have to help Me.

We cannot discuss about it, it is beyond our mental activity. You'll enjoy it I know, you'll feel very nice, but you must establish it fully. I hope all of you will make it a point to develop yourselves into great trees. I will come next year again. Till that you have to really grow into great Sahaja Yogis. So respect your Self Realization and you can achieve everything within one months' time. For which you don't have to pay anything - only some time to be given. We save the time, we have watches to save the time - to waste it. So, little time is to be given. So much Cool Breeze that I'm getting Breeze from you. (Shri Mataji laughing)

So, thank you very much! Thank you!
