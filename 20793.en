[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: In Delhi, Sahaja Yoga is growing with a very great force. And when something starts to grow, it should be remembered that, while it is spreading more, its most precious aspect, its quality, should not go down. If its quality falls, then such spreading out will not gain anything. That is why the quality of Sahaja Yogis should remain good. 

Now, an appeal has to be made to you about one thing. That, from your perspective, the three things that were asked from God Almighty - those have been granted. One of them is ‘salokhya’ which is, we can see God Almighty. ‘Sanidhya’ - that we can be with God Almighty. Companionship. ‘Samitya’, meaning we can be close to God Almighty. Three things you have attained. And there are many other things happening by which you can understand that, I am, in reality, Bhagwati.

Now a photo can come from France, where you can see, there is great light right over My Heart. Standing at the seashore. So, many such things have happened. My photos have appeared over the clouds in the sky. In a variety of such ways, you can prove it. But, I have given you one more thing that is greater than all. Which is called ‘tadatyma’. And this is the most difficult thing. For Me also and through which this work has taken place. Tadatmya means I have taken you inside My Body. You all reside in My Being.

Which is why, whenever you remember Me - then the work gets done, everyone benefits. The moment you remember Me, that information reaches all parts of My Being. That this one is in need. Like, if a finger gets slightly hurt, there is an injury - the whole body rushes to help the hand. So all the ganas, devdoots (angels) of God, they all rush to protect you. That you receive happiness. That whatever you desire should be fulfilled.

But if you develop any shortcoming, then I have to bear it. Earlier, I never had bad health. But now My health is worsening because Sahaja Yoga is spreading. And when it spreads, it collects some rubbish with it. Like yesterday, My health was really bad. That is why I had spoken about dharma at length. It means that we have not yet understood Sahaja dharma. We have come into Sahaja dharma. Now, what is Sahaja dharma? That we have attained a special thing which is to understand chaitanya (vibrations). We have vibrational awareness. We can perceive what chaitanya is. And what it is saying.

But the majority of people, by people I mean Sahaja Yogis - whenever they embark on something, they do not know vibrations, they do not recognise vibrations, they do not ask the vibrations, do not rely on vibrations. Meaning, do not depend on vibrations. They continue to stick to and go as per their old ways. And that is why their behaviour becomes asahaja (anti). If each and every time you think that, we should go by the vibrations and go by the indications of the vibrations, then you will come into Sahaja dharma. And when you come into Sahaja dharma, then My troubles will recede on their own.

Because, as soon as you get into some trouble, immediately My chakras start moving with great force. And they move with such a great force that I get troubled. Although, I do not fall sick ever - but My chakras move with force. And it is futile. Because you have no indication of it. You do not even know it sometimes. You cannot even benefit from it. Because, with your mind, heart, and intellect, you should think. You should be alert as to, ‘whether I am in Sahaja dharma or not’.

Now, in Sahaja dharma, a person cannot compromise with anything. Because ‘I am a Sahaja dharmi’. You try to compromise. You will face trouble and I will be troubled also. ‘Now what can we do, Mother? This needs some compromise’. So then, I have to bear it. What can I do? In so many affairs, the Sahaja way is not understood. Like, one gentleman said yesterday that to print Nirmala Yoga here, You please get this machine and that machine. So I said at first, ‘Alright. Get it'. Because, not to displease anyone. Because just saying no outright would have worsened the situation.

But there is a gentleman I know, who is a printer and he was asked to come today morning. Because, as per the vibrations, it did not feel alright. So I thought that telling them outright would hurt their feelings. But based on the vibrations it seemed nothing was required. Alright. Called him. Talked to the printer and he said, ‘Every three months you are coming out with a small newsletter. What is the necessity to spend so much money on it?’ He laughed at it. He told him, ‘Even a person who writes books upon books will not invest so much, then why are you spending on such a small thing?’

I said I felt the same and so I thought I should ask you. He said, ‘My friend has a printing outfit and he will give you half price for whatever you need. He has one machine better than another. And if you want to print a small book, once in three months, and if you want to buy an entire printing house - what can be said about that?’ So this is not Sahaja. If I say it outright that, don’t do this, then there will be hurt feelings. And if I say it after some time, then they say somebody has poisoned Mother’s ears. Someone said something. This is very common.

The one who can poison Me has not been born till now (yogis laugh). No one can influence Me. I am simple. But I am not so simple that anyone can sway Me. Because the big difference between you and Me is that, within Me, there is only Sahaja dharma and nothing else. I go only by Sahaja dharma.

One gentleman - I do not remember if I told you this the last time or not. In Rahuri, some big, what we call the ‘Barabai karasthan’ [name of a secret alliance in Maharashtra history] came over. They started to explain to Me. That this person, who you think so highly of, is into politics. And he is here for political reasons. And you better be careful about him. And we have come to make You understand’. I said, ‘Alright. Anything else about him?’ ‘No Mother. He is a politician. He will try to influence you. ‘Is that right? He will influence Me? Is that all you know?’ Said, ‘Yes. Do not listen to anything he says. He is highly political.’

I said, ‘Now, can I tell you? This man’s wife is not his real wife. She is the wife of some brahmin. He has eloped with her. Because the child that was born to her is not even his child. It is the brahmin’s child. And he eloped with her and is living with her.’ Told them a multitude of such things and their faces just changed (yogis laugh). And they said, ‘Mother, you know all this about him?’ I said, ‘Yes. I know all of this. Now you say.’

[Aside] This is very cold. Please remove it. Here, some...Yes, please put on the shawl. Now, this is also an example of a sahaja thing. If you keep a cushion there, anyone can climb over it and then the whole thing will get pulled. Now on a hot day, if someone keeps silk down there, then it’s all gone for a toss. You all are sitting comfortably. And by seating Me on this silk. you are cooling Me [yogis laugh]. You are comfortable and have seated Me on this silk. It's alright now. I am joking. No, no, I have no problem like that. I am just joking. No, no, I am fine.

Now this is about Sahaja. It is about being Sahaja. Now, if someone does it the Sahaja way, then the work is so well integrated, so beautifully done that I immediately understand who has done it. Overthinking with your brains leads to a mess. That’s one thing. Second, we feel that we are Sahaja Yogis, so we can do anything that we want. No, that is not the case. You cannot do whatever you want.

Now, in My house, there are so many accountants. There are so many who have learnt accounting and I do not know a word of accounting. And, in My house, there are so many lawyers that I do not know at all what human laws are. Never. But the day before, Gagan brought over someone, and I said to him you have made this mistake here. He said, “Mother, I forgot to write it here” and I said that it was alright. Then he was astonished. How did I know? ‘Mother, how do you know this? You do not know accounts.’ Vibrations! Immediately My attention went there, the vibrations were not right over there.

Because the one who is in Sahaja - he keeps getting all the information from a humongous organisation. This is wrong; this is right; this is alright; this is bad. This is nice, etc. Instantly. For Me, there is no need to think. My computer is such that it is instantaneous, at that very moment. Now, whether I show it or not, that is My astuteness [yogis laugh]. But I know everything. And all of you come into Sahaja Yoga. Then you will benefit and I will also benefit.

In everything, one should be sahaja. And to be sahaja, we must remember that we have now been reborn. And that we have come into this like an infant. There is still a lot to be learnt. And whatever is the Sahaja marg (path/road) by which Mother takes us, we will only follow that. We are making a lot of mistakes. And mistakes will be made. If you do not make mistakes, then what is the point of My coming? But we must admit that we are making mistakes. And as much as possible, make use of vibrations.

Like, there is now one gentleman. He had a fight with his wife. So I said, ‘Have you checked the vibrations?’ He said no. So I said, ‘Alright’. Suppose someone tells you that, ‘Sir, your wife is very bad’, and you accept; it means you accept hearsay. See your vibrations. Even if you accept hearsay but be sound with vibrations.

Now suppose I tell you that I cannot come tomorrow. ‘No, you have come’. Then the one who insisted will himself not reach on time. There will be some problems in his house. Because I can see - forward, back, up, down - everything. So there should be no coercion. Like yesterday, I had not called anyone to My house. I said come over. But I did not say I would meet with anyone. Not with anyone. I had just one girl [to meet] but not anyone else. I said come over. There may be some confusion in what I said. I had said to come over. But by no means, it meant that you would find Me or I would meet you or hug You. That I would sit and chat with you. Who has time to spare?

‘Come over’ means you may come and meditate there. It does not mean anything else. ‘Oh, we were sitting there waiting for You.’ But why did you keep waiting? They could have meditated and left. Even Warren got a fright from the Delhiwallas. He is running back to Maharashtra. Better catch his tail or he will escape. He has been telling Me from the start - I am saying this plainly - he is saying that, in Maharashtra, ten thousand people will pass in front of You. Not one will touch Your Feet; not one will offer a flower at Your Feet.

If they come to meet anytime - say, someplace, sometimes it can happen [Mother says], ‘Come over’ - so there, I have a small flat. All of them cannot sit inside. Then they remain seated on the lawn outside and return from there. But they will never say, ‘You should arrange a meeting, you never let me meet, you have to arrange a meeting. I had come to meet Her. Why does Mataji not see us? Not like this. Not like that.’ Because, in sahaja feeling, we know that we have no right over Mother’s time. No one in this universe has the right. That is correct.

Now, the first time I was in Delhi, I saw that some sindoor was kept in a plastic container. And they got a plastic mug from some bathroom to wash My Feet. And a plastic container for My feet. Now I, if you have seen My photo from that time, I had a fright. ‘Oh God, I wonder what calamity is going to befall them’. Slowly, the sahaja protocol came into being that no, this is not the way; this is the way.

In the same way, now, with Sahaja gravity, it should be taken to heart. It was why, yesterday, [I] spoke about sahaja dharma, that you love Me, I know. Too much love. And that you have faith in Me. That also I know. You feel like giving everything you have to Mother; that also I know. I know it all. That you love Me very much. But this devotion has to be brought into practice. And practice? What has Mother to do with it? You give something to Mother or not; it makes no difference to Mother.

How much of a Sahaja Yogi are we becoming? How much of Sahaja dharma is growing within us? How much of the Sahaja attitude do we adopt in life? That should be observed. In the Sahaja buddhi (intellect), first of all, there should be ‘nirakepshita’ (no expectation, also means detachment). Nirakepshita means this - ‘Sir, my house, my wife, my children. My ashram. Or my centre. ‘Mother, you must come to My centre.’ Before that, ‘Come to my house’; this used to happen very frequently. Now tell Me, if I go on visiting everyone’s homes, then what remains of Me?

‘Alright, if not at home, please come to the centre.’ Now going to the centre is also not so simple. ‘Alright. If not the centre, can you at least come to the street corner over there?’ [yogis laugh]. Why? Because people see that, means everyone comes to know that - It is ‘I’. ‘I’ was the one who called Mataji and She came over to the street corner. This is the subtle thing. The subtlety here is - ‘I’ told Mother, and Mother came. Mother respects ‘me’ and so you should all respect me as well. That is its subtle thing.

When this is understood - that I am there for Mother, my house is for Mother, everything is for Mother only - then Mother may or may not come. Does anyone invite themselves into their own house? Like, I am inviting Myself into My home. ‘Is Your home’ - then why do you invite Me?  And if all your money is Mine, then why do you give it? Speaking in everyday terms, if I say I am going to gift My kada (bangle) to Myself, you will say how is that even possible? Or if I invite Myself to My house [you will say], ‘Did you fight with Your husband?’

In the same way, in expressing sahaja, one must not think that this is my house, these are my children. They are all Mother’s. So wherever Mother is, it is Hers. And then I put you into confusion; that is another problem. And then they say, ‘Mother, we don't know what happened. We went there with so much affection.’ Alright. But bring it into practice. That should be understood. In Sahaja Yoga, the first thing is nirapekshita. The habit of being bound should start going away. For some it may be, ‘My wife; this [problem] of my wife should be made alright.’ That should be detached immediately.

One should be very attentive towards one’s own self. You may very well think, ‘My son, he should go to Mother’. First, detach from that. Your son will be completely alright. Detachment is the solution to everything; you will be surprised. Yesterday someone had come. She was saying, ‘Mother, I had paralysis. I had this sickness, that sickness.’ I could even remember her face. Had met only once. And she is now in first-class condition. She started saying, ‘I just used to sit with the photo. And my faith in that did the rest’.

What happens is that when you take the photo and work hard with it, then you have to increase your faith. Because I am not in front [of you]. You have to increase your faith, increase your depth. And when you reach the depth, that is when you get results. That is why, those who have got their Self-realisation using the photo, they are sometimes much more [in quality] than those who are right now in front of Me. It is quite surprising.

Or sometimes I see if Modi has given Self-realisation to someone - they do a lot to serve Me compared to those whom I gave Self-realisation directly. Because he has already drilled into them - this is Mother, you should understand it. She is Mahamaya. Do not come under Her illusion. Observe all protocols with Her. He explains it to them. But, if I give realisation to someone directly, they sit on My Head. Then, ‘I had come. I had especially come to meet You.’ Who told you to come especially? What kind of an especial person are you? Why did you come? So this ‘I’ness has to reduce. ‘Me’, ‘mine’. That should be finished.

Just like Kabirdas has said so beautifully, that when a goat roams about, she keeps saying [bleats], ‘mein, mein, mein’, ‘mein’. All this which we say, what he meant was this ‘mein’, ‘mein’ [‘me’ is pronounced ‘mein’ in Hindi] - means we are all goats. ‘Mein, mein, mein, mein’. But when she loses her goat form, meaning when the goat dies. Her intestines are pulled out, washed, and dried. When they go on the road, pulling the strings [intestines made into a one-string instrument], then it says, ‘tuhi, tuhi, tuhi’ (only you). What a marvellous concept. He was a ‘julahe’ (weaver) and how he could see God Almighty in all his things. He would  say, ‘tuhi, tuhi, tuhi’. This idea will not enter our heads.

So, when you become nirapeksha, then in everything you will see only Him, you will know only Him, you will understand only Him. And it will be surprising how, from all directions, it is all coming together. How this matter is coming together. Like, one girl arranged flowers for Me, on the ground. She said, ‘Mother, look, I have made Ganeshji. I just arranged it, how did Ganeshji get formed?’ He guided your heart, your hand in the way needed to make Ganeshji. Which is very dear to Me. Just that was made, the one that is dearest [to Me], she made that. Because she had a surrendered heart, it [flower arrangement] became Ganeshji all on its own.

The moment I saw it, I was in tears. ‘How did you make My Shri Ganesh?’ So we must keep the example of Shri Ganesh in front of us. Just like His devotion, so are His actions. One must follow the dharma of Shri Ganesha. For him, ‘tuhi, tuhi, tuhi’; besides that nothing else matters. He is ready on one leg. No need to say anything. No need to even desire. Someone just says something and He is gone after it, all the ganas running after Him and resolved it. And if you are useless, then He is also standing with the ‘parash’ (axe) in the other hand. Will fix it. Why did they go and say such a thing to Mother?  Keeping [the ideal] of such Ganeshji in front of you, you should also get into Sahaja dharma.

By coming into Sahaja dharma, you will experience such peace within. Because with Sahaja dharma all the insecurity that is inside, insecurities - they just are finished. We are playing in the lap of God Almighty; what do we care? Insecurity or anything else. So there is security, complete security. In a Sahaja person, that is a different type of attitude and we have to accept that attitude. Stubbornness goes away, speech changes, natures change. Diamonds have to be chiselled out. Sahaja Yogis are themselves diamonds - as the diamond of the Spirit within comes forward - the diamond’s different facets appear by themselves. And as I watch it, I keep feeling happier, ‘Splendid. How this diamond is shining.’

Be alert to oneself and remain in Sahaja expression and Sahaja dharma. I am Sahaja dharmi. One gentleman started saying, ‘Mother, I am Sahaja dharmi.’ ‘Alright? What do you do?’ ‘I worship you every day. Offer flowers. Etc.’ Later found out that the police arrested him. [yogis laugh]. Great. What kind of Sahaja dharma were you following? Then came a message, ‘Tell Mother, that the police have arrested me.’ ‘So what did you do?’ All types of asahaj things. Not one or two. Where could I go to save him? And why save him?

In the same way, Sahaja Yogis think they are Sahaja Yogis. But yoga has to be of two types - bhakti and karma. Unless and until there is a yoga of bhakti and karma, you will not settle into Sahaja dharma. And only after settling into Sahaja dharma will you be established into the guru tattva. The one who is not alright, how can they lecture others?

Specially in the matter of money, I see that Delhiwallas have a peculiar condition. Just do not stick to money and money will come and touch your feet, I tell you. This I tell you is the first key. Now I do not understand money. It is the truth, I tell you. When I have to go to the bank, I take someone with Me - Warren or someone else. Rajesh or someone. I will just sign, that’s all. But you have to fill in the cheque. It’s true I tell you. I still do not know how to write out a cheque. I do not know why I go to the bank.

But, because there is nirapekshita in it. And who keeps track of the accounts and balances? Now Mr Modi was saying, Mother, don’t know what is happening. The account is not balanced - there is an extra thirteen, fourteen thousand in it. I said, ‘Let it be. God has given it. Leave it. Now that  God has provided the fourteen thousand extra, let it be. They will be required somewhere.’ What is there in it? Nirakepsh.

Nirapekshita means just that we have left everything to God Almighty. ‘Jaise rakhu raise rahu’ (The state you keep me in, I will abide). Leave it. In this Sahaja dharma one must be settled. You should leave money worries or any other worry. Just bring your actions into Sahaja. The man who says, ‘Mother, I am in great distress’; that man is not Sahaja. Cannot be Sahaja. ‘I have this trouble, I have that trouble.’ Day and night, ‘I have this trouble, I have that trouble. I don’t have a house. I have a house but don’t have a wife. I have a wife, but the children’....etc. Anytime you meet he has some problem.

But that should not be the case. The one who is Sahaja is, ‘How are you?’ ‘How meaning? I am swimming in the sea.’ ‘What sea?’ ‘The sea of bliss, what are you asking?’ That is the thing. Is it not? That is the law. Or the one who keeps complaining of troubles all the time - in the end, he will be trapped in such a problem that no one can help him.

Specially, Indians have this practice that if someone asks, ‘How are you?’ ‘I am fine’. ‘How is everything?’, ‘Let my enemies be in a bad way, I am well’. Although he may have cancer. He may have cancer but he will never say I have this trouble. This is our Hindustani, Bhartiya culture. ‘Oh, I heard your child is not well’. ‘I have ten children, one or other may fall sick. What’s great about that?’ This is the Hindustani way. And ‘problem’ is also a modern word. Earlier we knew the word ‘problem’ when studying Geometry only. [yogis laugh] No, it is true.

Now, ‘I have this problem, I have that problem’ is a common thing. I am old now, but in our time no one used the word ‘problem’.  That, ‘I have this problem’. We used the word ‘problem’ in Geometry only. And when we learned Geometry in Marathi, when everything was proved, it was ‘iti siddham’ (it is proved). Proved. That problem is solved. Or people would fail you. Now whomever you see, they have a problem.

Sahaja Yogi can never have a problem. Because the One who is giving the problem is also the One who has to solve it. So how will you have a problem? This word has to get out of Sahaja. Problem. Get rid of it completely. The English left it on our heads perhaps. But they also never said it. ‘Problem’. I have never; the English during our time never said, ‘I have some problem’.

And on top of that, in Sahaja, it should never be that you come and tell Mother the problems with others. That is even lower. If you have faith then all will be well. If someone comes to you, ‘My son is sick’; ‘Come along, let’s make use of the photograph. Come along’. But as soon as a man gets realisation, he first thinks, most surprisingly - ‘How many relatives of mine are sick?’ Heal all of them. Daily. A list is made. Daily. Heal all of them. Pay for their journey to come and meet. When Mother is coming to visit, then for Her reception, at least fifteen lepers, twenty lame, twenty-four sightless - all such should be standing there. Otherwise, Mother has not been honoured. Without the disabled being there. [yogis laugh]

Then [I] have to ask, ‘Is there at least one able-bodied among you? Or is everyone like this?’ [yogis laugh]. So, in Sahaja, a person thinks that, ‘I have to give something for Mother. Please let there be a beautiful flower for Mother. A nice flower. How many flowers can I present to Mother?’ Instead of that, they have put up a line of twenty-five people. This is not any kind of honour, gentlemen. Maybe that is why there is this tradition - when a guard of honour was presented, they held up very strong batons - they must have had it so that only able-bodied people could do this. That is why they made the guard of honour. So that only able-bodied persons could be presented. But now, if we do it, then all the blows will rain on Me [yogis laugh].

So the organisation of Sahaja is ‘swastha’ (fit). It is a fit organisation. Beautiful. Exceedingly beautiful. In bloom. Joy giving. Incomparable. That is the Sahaja organisation. I look at all things minutely. And feel happy in My mind. Like, the way you have made arrangements on the stage. Each and everything you made, the elephant, fish that you made; I know even the colours of all of them. My love overflows towards the one who made them. But if you put up a bhut in front of Me, as soon as I arrive, then My face will show it. That is what happens.

So, in a sahaja attitude, whatever pleases Mother should be offered to Her. And what pleases Mother? Our ‘prasanna’ (full of joy) faces and all the things in the world that are joy-giving. Means children and flowers. I get great joy from them. Children and flowers are those beautiful things that God Almighty has made, that are full of joy. The flower will wither tomorrow or maybe in two hours. But when it is in front of Me, it is joyful. And I have seen that when a flower is kept in My room, it grows automatically; its size increases. It feels so much joy.

In the same manner, you should also understand that when you come in front of Me in joy, then the boon of that very joy you will find in your well-being, in whatever ‘problems’ you have [laughter], only that will solve it. The joy with which you face Me. Crying will never work. If you bear it and face Me with joy -  then, as soon as you stand in front of Me - it will work out just like that. So we have to take to Sahaja attitude; we have to take to Sahaja dharma. And to attain Sahaja joy, first one must remain in joy.

Earlier, there used to be a word ‘manhoosiyat’ (wretchedness). Nowadays it is hard to hear it because it seems like all the wretched are roaming around. And if someone is not wretched then they say he is not handsome. One gentleman was very wretched and people there used to appreciate him a lot. I asked why and they started saying he is very handsome. I said, ‘This one, who is like a skeleton, is in such bad shape. His eyes sunk in. As if he is coming out of some graveyard.’ ‘He is very handsome.’ Everything of theirs is wrong side up. [Because], their heads are on the wrong side. So everything is seen in the wrong way.

I could not understand it in any way earlier. Now I am beginning to understand why they consider him handsome. Women who are, what is called ‘chidimaar’ (slang - like a twig) in Hindi; they like them. Don’t know. One puff and they will go and fall somewhere. They started saying that this is beautiful. How? From what angle? [yogis laugh].

There is a gentleman there, a Punjabi. Punjabis are not like that; it's not so bad with them. Right? He married a woman there. He left his first wife. So when we saw his first wife - his [new] wife is such a ‘khoosat’ (mean) woman - we felt, why did his first wife who is like a goddess? So he says to me that, ‘She is much better looking than my wife.’ [yogis laugh]. So My son-in-law says that better change his glasses. [yogis laugh]. So, people’s mindsets are going the other way and, if we follow the English, then I do not know who we will consider as beautiful. Sometimes there is someone who repels one at sight, yet people start calling the same person beautiful.

Not able to understand, someone leaning at an obtuse angle [yogis laugh] - how do they see everything the wrong way? In Sahaja, a man can see right through. In and out. The one who can see the beauty within; only he is a Sahaja Yogi. Not outer [beauty]. What’s there about outer? Now if you want, you just pay some money. You put up a ‘Dalda’ (a popular vegetable oil brand) tin on top of your head if you like and tie your hair around it - you are now fashionable, modern. It is called bouffant or something like that. [yogis laugh]. Nowadays Dalda tin has gone away. Out of fashion. Or you show off like this, then you are very fashionable. How strange it is.

And what should our thoughts be, what we should think about others - we do not understand. The one who is beautiful inside and the one who can recognise that is a Sahaja Yogi. Because they themselves are beautiful within. The one who has such beauty inside; only he can recognise such a person. It is not necessary that such a person is going around in a car or a bullock cart. Nor if they are on foot and their feet have blisters. Even then it is felt that, let us massage their feet with some oil. So that they feel better. Such a love develops even for the feet of the one who has a beautiful heart working within.

Unless and until you are able to recognise such a heart, you are not in Sahaja dharma. In that, there is no expectation, no greed or lust.  Just the beauty of such a person feels like a radiance of our own beauty. It just appeals by a look, by thinking, ‘Wah re wah. What a human being.’ This is Sahaja. One can talk so much about Sahaja dharma. This is not an outer; it is a dharma attained through inner yoga.

We can know it in many ways. Like, in Sahaja dharma, speaking ill of someone, criticising any religion is a sin. A sin. It is considered a sin. Criticising a realised soul is considered the greatest sin.  Not only that, but even considering any country’s saint or incarnation as less than another’s is also considered a sin. All are alike. Just like our one eye and the other, one hand and the other - we do not differentiate. In the same manner, we fully respect all religions. There is no need to go in front of a mosque and start singing songs like some monkeys. As it is, you are no kind of melodious singers. Ordinary, decent people will get up from their sleep and run away.

And those with mosques - just going about anywhere and constructing mosques. So that Ramachandrachaji’s bhoomi (Shri Rama’s kingdom, Ayodhya) - it is not possible to attain it. It will get destroyed tomorrow. Yes, even the mosque that is made is Ramachandraji’s. Who was Ramchandraji? He is the one you are remembering when you say, ‘Allah O Akbar’. Who else are you remembering? Even if Mohammad Saab did not say, I am saying it. He was Shri Rama. Whether you make a temple there or a mosque. Or a church. The prayers are being offered to Shri Rama only.

Call Him Rama or call Him Rahim. Then what is the quarrel about? Alright, there is a mosque. Alright, we will come to your mosque. And we will offer namaz there. But not from the mullahs; we will offer it in our way. What will the quarrel remain about then? This is not a mandir-masjid quarrel. It is the quarrel between the mullah and the priest. Because it is a matter of the stomach [income]. Whether the masjidwallahs earn or the mandirwallahs earn; it is just that.

In Sahaja dharma, because money has no importance - this quarrel is no more. This quarrel is just no more. In Sahaja, the greatest thing is, that we must understand that we are the religion of the Spirit. We are Atmaja (the Spirit). Placed in the Spirit. We are of the caste of the Spirit. It is the one and only - to know, to attain, to give importance to - the sole means and the sole object. And the rest is futile. That is why, there is no question of fights or quarrels in Sahaja dharma. Because the Spirit is the same in everyone.

And when I see love and friendship between all of you, I am filled with joy. Nowadays there is friendship between Dr. Warren and Dr. Talwar. Let it endure. Because both of them are ‘roaring’ [probably vocal] people. It is decreasing; the ‘roaring’. But it is pleasing to see such a friendship has developed. How many friends you have, Venugopalan?

Venugopalan: All are friends.

Shri Mataji: All are. No, one - you tell Me. No, no. I don’t believe you. First start with one friend. Then two. Then with three. All means it is lost. ‘Let us see; there is one friend of mine.’ Start it like that. This is just a crowd then. All are your friends. Who is your friend, Subramanian?

Subramanian: You.

Shri Mataji: No, no. Me? Forget about Me. I am just a bubble. Let us see. How many friends have you got here?

Subramian: [unclear/I have no enemies here].

Shri Mataji: No, no enemies. Friends? Mr Verma, who is your friend? Name one friend. No, no you have to tell this [laughs]. ‘Everybody’ - that has no meaning.

A Sahaja Yogi: I have got one - Yogi Mahajan.

Shri Mataji: I don’t think so there. I wouldn’t say that. I wouldn’t say that. That is not friendship. So many foreigners have come. How many have you made friends with? They remain untouched [separate]. Become friends with one and show. One friend first. Let us see. But one thing I will say is that the foreigners are great friends among themselves.

[Shri Mataji speaks in English]

What is the criteria, let us see. The criteria of the friend is this - that even I am challenged.

In the sense, that I try to test you - suppose. I will tell you something against, say your friend Yogi Mahajan. And if you support that, then you are not his friend. Alright? And that’s what I find. But supposing I tell something to Warren or to Doctor [Talwar]; they will support each other. Thick and thin. That sort of a friendship. I just test you. And I like people who support the Sahaja Yogis. Who come forward and say, ‘Mother, please forgive him. I know he did some mistake. But please forgive him’. I feel very happy. That’s how we correct each other. Through friendship.

But most of you will say one thing, ‘My wife is my friend’. Or ‘my husband is my friend’. But there also I would like to say, I am not very sure [laughs]. Then what will happen? Imagine that all of you are cells in My body. And nobody is friendly. How am I to carry on this message? How am I to carry on this Body of Mine?

So, in Sahaja dharma, we are collective beings, and we stand by each other. Even if we face our Mother. That’s friendship. You have to support each other. Help each other. ‘Please forgive, Mother. He might have done a mistake. Please help him, Mother’. That I love the most.

[In Hindi]Doctor Chugh, who is your wife? Do you have any friend other than her or is she the only one? Are you two sitting together? She is over there, at least. So make each of you make at least one friend. We have Rakhi Bandhan over here. But we should have ‘Bhai Bandhan’ (bond of brothers) also. Organise one ‘Bhai Bandhan’. What is the objection to that? There is Rakhi Bandhan, now we will have Bhai Bandhan also.

[In English]Venugopalan, you find out your friend. And now we will have Bhai Bandhan. Yogi Mahajan, you too. Rakhi bandhan is alright. That is for the safe married life. But what about Bhai Bandhan? So today we decide, that in Sahaja Yoga, we all will have a Bhai Bandhan to begin with. Then how many ‘bhais’ (friends/brothers) you have is not the point. Start with one. You don’t have eleven children all together, do you? So you can have one brother. Then another brother. I can’t have all the brothers together. So, if that has to happen, you must have one friend, to begin with. Then a second friend. Then a third friend. Alright?

[In Hindi]So today, we have learned that in Sahaja dharma, that brotherhood should start with one and then extend out to everyone. And as you ascend you will find that brotherhood will increase. Those who have reached high, you will find that they have great friendships with one another. Like Gregoire is in Switzerland, Warren is here, and James is in Australia. All of them will give their life for one another. That is right. These people have attained brotherhood more than us because they had not known it. 

Right at this moment, My brother has also come, see. Come. So, this has to be known. That we should have one firm friend. Among Sahaja Yogis.

Alright, now let us have the puja. I was waiting for them only. Before we start the puja - have you made the list? Is it made? It’s not sisterhood, is it?[laughs]. [yogis laugh]. Else the list will be made of all sisters. It's not that, is it?

Now I am also feeling well. Because you are happy, so I am also happy.
