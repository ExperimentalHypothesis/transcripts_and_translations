Talk to  Yogis, 1996-07-14, Hotel Sofitel Victoria Warszawa, Warsaw, Poland

May God bless you. Please, be seated.

[UNCLEAR]
I am so happy to see all of you [UNCLEAR there/here]. I've never expected so many of you there [UNCLEAR there/here], really.
I've never knew Sahaja Yoga has grown so much. It is such a pleasure to see you all there [UNCLEAR].

Now we have to know that we have to grow in Sahaja Yoga. For that we must meditate.

You see, some people say this is wrong with me, that is wrong with me, everything will disappear if you really meditate. That is the most important thing we don't understand sometimes.

If you meditate and your problems are not solved, you can tell me. But it should be done very regular. It should be done very regular. We [UNCLEAR not/don't] have a fix time, whenever you want, but every day. Then you will see your growth. How you go into spirituality, in such a deep way. Very much you need in this country. Yesterday I saw some people suffering very much because they went for a catholic church. And they're just trembling before me like this, they're just trembling. I don't know what they do to you. I don't understand what they do to you. But I think this religion is based on fear. And that makes you feel so guilty.  And when you feel guilty all problems start [UNCLEAR]. Christ never said these things, that they are doing. You [UNCLEAR see] their own ideas. How can [UNCLEAR He] put fear into you?

Islamic religion is even worst. Nobody can say [UNCLEAR] that they don't want to be islamic.

They are just killed. They are just killed. They are punished very [UNCLEAR heavily]. Their hands are cut. They are put in the Mother Earth and finished. Their necks are cut. I mean it's absolutely inhuman, absolutely. So all this can only end if they also know what is reality. They don't know the reality. They are blind. So you feel really a kind of a great sympathy for them, but what can you do.

Here the Christians belive if they don't follow Christianity, they'll go to hell. [UNCLEAR] Muslims are really frightened. Another is buddhism, where you have to give lots of money and the [UNCLEAR] this and that. This is not religion. Religion has to come from within. And in Sahaja Yoga you become religious, you become righteous. They don't like us because we are so moral. Because we are so good. What can you do? So it's all right, don't worry about any opposition.

But I was telling him that you should go and tell the party which is in power nowadays, [UNCLEAR] which is against this catholic church, that we are with you.

Communism did one thing good. Communism has done one thing good, that is surely stoped all the religions first of all.

But this catholic church will not leave your necks, I tell you. So, I 'm working it out, but somehow you 'll be very careful. You have to tell all the catholics what they are up to. That the last judgement has come. And everything about catholicism as you know is horrible. That is how you should understand you are here for such a great event and somehow you have now entered into the Kingdom of God. Don't have any fear, no guilt and compassion [UNCLEAR learn/but] to forgive everything, that's all.

I'm sorry I couldn't come yesterday and I won't be able to spend so much time with you. But the first time I'm talking to Sahaja yogis [UNCLEAR], normally I don't.

Because your leader was so anxious that I must talk to you. Now you have to go for this work and I will be there and I hope you will get more people, many more. All right?

[UNCLEAR] miraculous photographs. [UNCLEAR]

We have so many [UNCLEAR]. So many. In the sky also. This is the sign of  last judgement.

All right.

May God bless you all.
