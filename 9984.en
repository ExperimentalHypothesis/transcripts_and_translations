Talk to Sahaja Yogis, 1996-07-14, Hotel Sofitel Victoria Warszawa, Warsaw, Poland

May God bless you. Please, be seated.

Just allow it to be there [unsure; about the mike]
So, now.

I was so happy to see all of you there. I never expected so many of you there, really.
I never knew Sahaja Yoga has grown so much. It is such a pleasure to see you all there in such a pretty [Inaudible].
Now we have to know that we have to grow in Sahaja Yoga. For that, we must meditate.
You see, some people say, “This is wrong with me, that is wrong with me”. Everything will disappear if you really meditate. That is the most important thing; we don’t understand sometimes. If you meditate and your problems are not solved, you can tell Me. But it should be done very regularly. It should be done very regularly. Need not have a fixed time, whenever you want, but every day. Then you will see your growth. How you go into spirituality in such a deep way. Very much, you need in this country. 

Yesterday, I saw some people suffering very much because they went for a Catholic church. And they’re just trembling before Me like this gesture. I don’t know what they do to you. I don’t understand what they do to you. But I think this religion is based on fear. And that makes you feel so guilty. And when you feel guilty, all problems start in a being. Christ never said these things, that they are doing. This is their own ideas. How can He put fear into you?

Islamic religion is even worst. Nobody can say, “No”, that they don’t want to be Islamic.
They are just killed. They are just killed. They are punished very heavily. Their hands are cut. They are put in the Mother Earth and finished. Their necks are cut. I mean, it’s absolutely inhuman, absolutely! So, all this can only end if they also know what is reality. They don’t know the reality. They are blind. So, you feel really a kind of a great sympathy for them, but what can you do?

Here the Christians believe, if they don’t follow Christianity, they’ll go to Hell. All Hells, the Muslims are really frightened.

Another is Buddhism, where you have to give lots of money and the penances and this and that. This is not religion. Religion has to come from within. And in Sahaja Yoga, you become religious. You become righteous. They don’t like us because we are so moral. Because we are so good. What can you do? So, it’s all right, don’t worry about any opposition. But I was telling him that you should go and tell the party which is in power nowadays, the one which is against this Catholic church, that we are with you. Communism did one thing good.

[Applause]
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Communism has done one thing good, that it finished off all the religions, first of all.
[Applause]
But this Catholic church will not leave your necks, I tell you. So, I ‘m working it out, but somehow, you’ll be very careful. You have to tell all the Catholics what they are up to. That the Last Judgement has come. And everything about Catholicism, as you know, is horrible. That is how you should understand it. You are here for such a great event and somehow you have now entered into the Kingdom of God. Don’t have any fear, no guilt and compassion. You have to forgive everyone, that’s all.

I’m sorry I couldn’t come yesterday and I won’t now be able to spend much time with you. But it’s the first time I’m talking to Sahaja Yogis, so can you please survive at that? [Laughter] Because your leader was so anxious that I must talk to you.
Sahaja Yogini: Thank you.
Shri Mataji: Now you have to go for this work and I will be there. And I hope today we will get more people, many more.
All right?
Sahaja Yogis: Yes.
Speaker: Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: [unclear] I’ll get it.

[To the photographer] You could ask one miraculous photograph.

Speaker: Mother you didn’t bring those two photographs that you showed me upstairs?
Sahaja Yogini: I’ll send it.
Speaker: Please bring, I’ll show them.

Speaker [to shri Mataji]: I say- Shri Mataji we would like to see, all of us, those photographs you just showed us upstairs. So, they will wait for the photographs, I’ll try and show them.
Shri Mataji: Which ones?
Speaker: The miraculous photographs that I saw.
Shri Mataji: [Laughter] All right. I’ll send it to her. You can show them.
Speaker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Now, we have so many of them. So many! In the sky also. This is the sign of Last Judgement.
All right.
May God bless you all.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, our collectivity has a small souvenir, that’s some Polish nature, this is type of the Polish nature. There are pictures of our Mother Land, different. We have a very, very nice country side, very nice nature in Poland. Yes.
Shri Mataji: They are all so blissful [unsure]
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Some landscape.
Shri Mataji: Oh! All these are there?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they are here.
Shri Mataji: Still?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they are [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Oh! Woah! What a photograph! Who has done the photographs?
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, that’s company.

Shri Mataji: You employed a photographer.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Sahaja Yogi: It looks like a picture.
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Sahaja Yogi: It looks like a picture but this is a photograph.
Shri Mataji: And what is there?
Sahaja Yogi: It is a piece of land.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful.

Sahaja Yogi: This is grass.
You see, this is forest, nearby. Nearby forest, very deep forest.
Shri Mataji: Autumn.
Sahaja Yogi: Autumn, yes.

Shri Mataji: Oh, you have all been there?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: I’ve never seen one like this.
Sahaja Yogi: But this is done by spiders.
Shri Mataji: Spider but do you have-
Sahaja Yogi: Water, this is water, You know, it’s probably in the morning or in the evening.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Morning time.
Sahaja Yogi: Morning time, yes.

This is winter already.

Shri Mataji: This is in the north?
Sahaja Yogi: No, it’s in the whole country.
What I want to say is this is in our winter time. So, it’s already snowing.

Shri Mataji: No time has blamed you. Winter is the best. Yours has [unclear].
It’s for Me, this book?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear].
All right. Thank you very much.
Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Let’s go.

Child: It’s all right? Do you like chocolate?]
Shri Mataji: What is this?
Alganesh: Chocolate?
Child: Chocolate.
Shri Mataji: Chocolate. All right. Very kind of you. Thank you.

We have to go now.

[Question inaudible]
Shri Mataji: You’d better cut it down.
Sahaja Yogi: Ok Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: That’s very important. So, when it will come back again, poor child has to suffer because she can’t eat this, she can’t eat that.
Sahaja Yogi: Ok Shri Mataji
Shri Mataji: With that is all right. It’s normal there.
