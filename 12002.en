I am grateful for what all you have done for me. I would be glad if you all grow deeper into Sahajayoga. Many of you are good Sahajis.

You must remember that you have to become ideal yogis because you have to transform the whole world. That is what your Mother expects from you, that is my only desire. Everything else is futile, of no value. Then only you enjoy being in the Kingdom of the Divine.

You must meditate everyday, that is the only way to mature in Sahajyoga. You have to save all those unfortunate drug addicts also. Let your heart emit love, compassion and generosity.

May God bless you all.
