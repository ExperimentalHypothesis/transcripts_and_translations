 (England)
Thank you for taking the time for this session on the times that you spent with Her Holiness Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi on the various properties that she had in England, Italy, and India—Pratisthan. It had been foretold by William Blake; he called them the "golden builders." So it's really a privilege to have some of Shri Mataji's golden builders here.

I'd like to start with Pat, if you could tell us—and this question is for everyone. Briefly, how did you get your realisation? Where were you at that point in time? If you could put a timeline, that'd be great. And what was your first experience of meeting Shri Mataji like? Pat, please.

Pat: Well, I went through it in the other interview. We went through that already. By the time the golden builders type of stuff started, we'd already been with Mother for quite a while, years even.

The other thing about the golden builder setup, which is quite different from most things that took place with Shri Mataji, is that it was a very rough, tough, chaotic atmosphere. Lots of stuff was flying about—rubble, noise, dust, and walls falling down and being knocked down. So the way we interacted with Mother wasn't quite the same. Mostly, it would be very... you'd be lost in awe of Mother, in meditation, and listening to her. And it would be an extraordinary atmosphere. When Mother was there and we were doing building work, it was kind of different, and Mother would get quite involved in it all. She'd be around all the time.

I remember in Brompton Square when someone put a nail through a pipe and there was a water leak. I jumped up and yelled, "There's a leak!" at the top of my voice, turned my head around, and found myself facing Shri Mataji about two feet away from her. I felt like a complete idiot. But this is the sort of thing that went on and Mother would be mixed up in it. So it's kind of different.

Interviewer: So what's your first memory of working on a Sahaj property of Shri Mataji? Was it Chelsham Road?

Pat: No, it was actually Mother's house. She decided when she was going to sell it that she wanted it to be decorated. It was me and this chap called Gus there, and we had no experience in decorating work at all. We had no idea what we were doing. There were these tiny cracks in places, and we kind of gouged them all out into these huge chasms and then tried to fill them with plaster. It looked like they were just bodged up with chewing gum, and then we painted them. It looked like a film set for a film about earthquakes. Sir CP never said anything; he used to give it extraordinary looks. We just did our best. The people who came to look at the house to buy it stared at it as well. The house ended up getting sold. So that was my first experience.

After that, nothing much happened until, I suppose, about Brompton Square, it must have been. Although, at some point around then, we had all these housing co-op properties all around London where we used to do all kinds of work. We used to get them to rent, or rent-free actually, for periods of six months or a year for this housing co-op that was organized. We had to do all kinds of odd jobs to clean them up and get them okay. In a couple of them, I did work on the gas and central heating and stuff like that.

Brompton Square started in 1981, so they were around that time. Brompton Square was probably the one where we did the most work. But I did work in Chelsham Road probably before that, before we got married in 1980, because I was working there with another yogi. When we got married, there was no roof on the meditation room at Chelsham Road. We had to put polythene sheeting over it with balloons and things. So, I did some work there on the meditation room, and then it was probably Brompton Square.

Interviewer: We've had the privilege of looking at some of the photographs of Brompton Square. And the other day, the housewarming at Brompton Square was shared on one of the evening meditations. It was really a beautiful house with so many handcrafted things and effects done to it.

Can I address this question to Laurent? Greshna, John, Fergie, Derek, and Alan, you've kindly told us about how you got your realization in previous interviews. So, if we could have Laurent, please.

Laurent: I started in 1980 at a program in Zurich. My mom's aunt was the seeker in the family who tried and experienced everything. She was working with Gregoire's sister in Switzerland. So, when she discovered Shri Mataji, she gave me a call and said, "Forget everything I ever told you about anything. Now, just drop everything and come." She was like a guru of the family in a way. So I quit my part-time job, dropped everything, and within a day, I was on the road to Zurich, across France and Switzerland. I met my aunt there and got realization in the evening.

I didn't quite understand much of the speech; it was translated for the Swiss Germans. My English wasn't that good at the time either. But for the first time in my life, I didn't think anymore. I didn't need to think. I was just enjoying myself in the present like never before. There were no more problems, no more worries. Ideally, I would have liked to stay on that chair for the rest of my life, just sitting and enjoying the moment. There was nothing else to be asked for. It was quite amazing.

Following that—that was a Friday evening—we spent Saturday in the apartment of Arnaud de Calbomartin in Zurich. And on Sunday morning, I had a minivan; I was sleeping in a little white van that all the colleagues here know about. I rang the bell of the apartment to join them again, and Shri Mataji had called the yogis for puja, which I didn't know, obviously. The yogini at the door wasn't going to let me in at first. I said, "Okay, what's happening?" And she said, "Wait here." She went to ask Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji said, "Oh, the new guy is here. Let him come." So, I had my realization on Friday, and I was washing Shri Mataji's feet on Sunday. I was so blissed out that nothing mattered. I was just on a cloud and everything was wonderful.

It was a bit of a start. I came to England in, I think, 1981. Shri Mataji came to France for a seminar, and she actually asked my mom for her permission for me to come to England for a month or so to help her with the house. I was supposed to go to England for a month, but I didn't know it was going to turn into four years at the time. I was meant to fix the kitchen doors in the kitchen. So I said, "Great, I'll go." We bought the doors in France, and I brought them to England. For the first time, customs didn't look in my van when I drove through with it full of oak doors and tools.

When I arrived and saw Brompton Square for the first time, I said, "Okay, where's the kitchen?" He said, "Oh, that's this room." There was no concrete floor in that room. "I'm just here for a month to fix the kitchen doors. Who's doing the kitchen?" He said, "Oh, you are." I said, "What do you mean, I am? I'm just here to fix the doors."

When Pat mentioned we broke down the walls in Brompton Square, I think what got broken down the most were all the egos and conditionings we had. Shri Mataji worked quite strongly on knocking down all the big walls we had in ourselves. It was quite challenging. I don't think there's a single one of us who didn't have a moment where we thought, "I'd like to be miles away from this place. It's just getting to be too much." But we have great memories.

You mentioned the housewarming party in Brompton Square. That's where I met Alan for the first time. We were squeezed in the room, really tight with each other. I was sitting next to Alan, and that's how we got to know each other.

There was also a house in Victoria, Ashley Gardens. Shri Mataji would ask you to come for something, and then she'd order McDonald's for everyone. Beautiful.

Interviewer: Thank you very much, Laurent. Could we ask John to tell us about the times with Shri Mataji? What was the first property that you worked on?

John: That would have been Ashley Gardens. Well, I say "work." I offered to wash all the carpets in the flat, which Shri Mataji kindly agreed to because I wanted to make all the carpets soft and springy for her feet. That was difficult because as soon as I started working, it was just a bombardment of thoughts as the negativity was coming out.

As Pat was saying, the early days of Brompton Square were very messy—walls being knocked down and a lot of soot and dust. I think a lot of yogis were wearing balaclavas and things. I remember Shri Mataji saying, "I can't recognise any of you, but I know you by your vibrations," because we'd all have these weird costumes on.

I think Brompton Square was the most intimate with Shri Mataji. As Pat was saying, she would be around all the time. In the very early times, she had the same shoes, same sari, and headscarf because she was hands-on herself. She was showing us how to stain varnish, and I remember she told some yogis off for putting the filler on the walls. It was very rough, and she was showing them how to do it in a very smooth way, so there was very limited sanding down.

It was cold at times, and there was the midnight shop down the road. Yogis took great delight in buying Shri Mataji sausages because she said that she liked sausages. So she'd get a never-ending supply of sausages. But Brompton Square was very, very beautiful. It was like a jewellery box. As soon as you entered, it had the beautiful screen on the left, and everything was just real art and craft, with all her beautiful things within it. And once Shri Mataji was there, of course, then it was complete. Brompton Square was a very special place.

Interviewer: In front of Ashley Gardens, the vibrations were beautiful. And we went and visited the McDonald's, which supplied the endless burgers and the strawberry milkshake, apparently.

John: There used to be a Wimpy bar, I think, in those days.

Interviewer: Okay, brilliant. Thank you for sharing that. Could I ask Fergie to briefly tell us where his journey started?

Fergie: Housing-wise? Okay. I discovered that Shri Mataji was going to leave England because Sir CP only had a four-year term. I had just gotten my realisation and didn't know much. So, because I was a qualified plasterer, I thought I might as well move down to London and find out more. I discovered Chelsham Road and moved in there. Later on, Shri Mataji said to me, "I'm buying a new house. You can come and work on it."

In the meantime, she had the house in Ashley Gardens. I remember she asked me to go there to move some boxes. There were lots of other Sahaja Yogis there. While I was there, the phone rang, and somebody was making some complaints about me. I was like, "Oh my God." I was behind Shri Mataji's bed, so I couldn't move. She was saying, "Oh, really? Is that true? Fergie this, Fergie that." And I was like, "Oh my God." Then she put the phone down and said, "Don't worry. I know everything." We're all involved with dramas, but Shri Mataji had us there to see things. So sometimes we're there in a house for other reasons.

Then I started work on Brompton Square. One day, the builder was ripping off Sir CP. He took out the main staircase, or rather, he didn't put it in, so Shri Mataji couldn't walk around the house to see what was going on. One day, a Sahaja Yogi named Danny went out, bought a brand new staircase, fitted it himself, and then Shri Mataji walked around the whole house and vibrated it. That changed a lot of things. With building workers, they have their tea room with all sorts of things in it, so every few weeks, Shri Mataji would get us to do something in those rooms so their negative vibrations wouldn't stay too long.

One day, the builder came to the house, but he was a kleptomaniac. Shri Mataji had asked him to come in to tell him off. He was big and really arrogant because he was taking all the money. As he came in, on the left, there was a cabinet with little trinkets. He picked up one of the trinkets and put it in his pocket while waiting for Shri Mataji to come out of her room. I saw that and thought, "Wow." Then I thought I needed to say something. I said to one of his workers, "Can you tell your boss to put that thing back he just stole from the cabinet?" He was completely oblivious that he'd put it in his pocket. I took it from him and put it back, so he was on the back foot.

Then Shri Mataji came out, and—not many people have seen Shri Mataji in 'wrath of God' mode—she just blasted him. Normally Sir CP was dealing with the builder, but he never... I don't think he'd seen Shri Mataji like that. She was usually quiet. She just blasted him, and he was completely finished after that. He made sure the workers did the work properly, and everything went much better.

The builders had a hard time because the Sahaja Yogis didn't have any tools, so they kept taking the builders' tools. A man would say, "Where's my hammer?" and it would be at the top of the house. I was the only one with tools, so I was chasing after my tools all day. By the time I went to the top floor and found one, I'd go back down and the next one was missing. So tools were definitely an issue there.

After the builder left, one of the workers enjoyed our company so much that he asked if he could carry on working there, which he did. But he complained that every morning, his whole body would come out in a rash because he used to drink gin. When he came into the house, because of the vibrations, he would come out with a rash. We were telling him that he needed to get his realization and do Sahaja Yoga. So, every room there was a drama. That was my first initial time.

Interviewer: Great, thank you. Could we ask Alan, was Brompton Square your first experience working at Shri Mataji's house?

Alan: Yes, it was. I can't remember whether at that time I was living at Chelsham Road or at Nightingale Lane, probably Nightingale Lane. I can just remember walking into Brompton Square, and it was like walking into the universe, with all the yogis trying to sort out all the problems of the universe. Shri Mataji was basically clearing us out. I don't think it had anything to do with the building work; it was more to do with us cleansing ourselves through the work we were doing.

Like I think it was John who was saying, everybody was dressed in balaclavas and bobble hats and weird outfits. I thought, "Blimey, this is really weird." They were all stripping wallpaper off the walls, causing destruction. Nobody had an idea of what they were doing, but it was great fun.

I think Sir CP contracted the builders in the beginning to do a lot of the main work, laying the concrete floor in the basement and all that. But in the end, she got yogis to take over. What I remember was that Sir CP paid the builders, and the first batch of builders ran away after he paid them. This was the way Shri Mataji arranged it so the yogis could come in and do the work. Of course, Sir CP was very grateful and very nice to everyone.

I must have arrived in between the builders when it was just the Sahaja Yogis in there, and I was just amazed at what havoc there was everywhere. But Mother didn't mind; she was joyful about everything. I also remember later on when the builders did arrive, this thing of the tools. I think they used to call the Sahaja Yogis "the loonies" or something. "What have the loonies done with our tools?" They'd get a tool back, and then ten minutes later it would disappear again. They really didn't know how to handle it.

Apart from some laboring on building sites, I hadn't done any building work. Shri Mataji said, "Oh, you're going to do the carpentry." I think Laurent was the carpenter. She started me doing little jobs around the house. When she used to meet people, she would say, "I taught Alan carpentry." And it was true; she taught me everything I knew about it.

Interviewer: How old were you at that point, Alan, if I may ask?

Alan: I got my realization when I was 23, in 1979. So we're talking '81, '82.

Interviewer: So how was your journey from Bristol into the thick of things in London?

Alan: Fergie got his realization in Bristol and very quickly realized he wasn't going to get the information he required, so he decided he was off to London. After he'd done that, I'd been in Cheltenham on my own for a year, just giving people realization and telling them about Sahaja Yoga. It was great, actually. When we came to Sahaja Yoga in those early days, we didn't have any information. Now we have so much. I think we had one sheet of paper, "A Unique Discovery." We had that and a chakra chart, and off I went, giving realization. I had no fear about it. I'd had such a transformation within myself and such a faith in Shri Mataji. All those crazy things happening around with Sahaja Yogis didn't matter. I just knew who she was. I would just approach everybody, anywhere.

I decided I would go to London, so I moved up and went straight into the Chelsham Road ashram. That was an experience. There was a girls' dorm and a men's dorm. There must have been about 10 to 15 of us in the men's room in our sleeping bags, like sardines. It was my first night there, and I got into my sleeping bag on the floor—no mattress, just a sleeping bag, head on the floor—thinking, "This is all a bit strange."

All of a sudden, I felt this warm sensation in my ear. It was one of the yogis—I don't know whether he was called "the monk" or something because he always had massive scarves around his neck, even in mid-summer. He was pouring warm mustard oil into my ear. He knew it was my first time in an ashram, didn't ask me, didn't tell me he was going to do it, and just poured this oil into my ear. My whole faith was in Shri Mataji, but the Sahaja Yogis, as far as I was concerned, they all seemed like complete mad people.

You just sort of went into this witness state. There were so many things going on. In the men's room, everybody had their different routines. Everybody would have an alarm clock, all set for different times. The first alarm would go off at about 2:00 or 2:30 in the morning, and the person would start doing all their ceremony, whatever they were doing. Then, one by one, the alarms would go off. We also had another yogi in the room that would sleepwalk. He would do the most extraordinary things, like build brick walls or have fights with his pillow. One morning, he woke me up at about three in the morning, shaking me, saying, "Meditation time, meditation time!" Then he woke up in the middle of that and said, "Oh, I was asleep," and went back to bed. It was a very interesting time.

Greshna: In Chelsham Road, we only had one bathroom and about 30 people living there. Everyone had to set their alarm during the night to go and have a bath.

Alan: This is the thing, isn't it? Chelsham Road was a building site. It remained a building site for many years. It was only really when it was bought by another yogi that the work eventually got done. It was an interesting place to live.

Greshna: Until I got married on December 5th, 1980, I was living there, and everything was falling apart. You couldn't really fix anything. You'd fix one thing, and something else would disintegrate. In the kitchen, it was a similar situation. Lots of people were living there, but there was this tiny kitchen with just a couple of ladies, and we were just cooking and washing up. I was very new at the time and thinking, "Is this my life?" I remember there was a little mouse living in the kitchen that had been named Roderick. It used to come out every now and then.

Alan: I was just going to say, John was such fun. When I was in Chelsham Road, he was a joy because he was the one I felt was really sane. He was very devoted to Mother.

John: The person they were talking about, the one with the scarf, he was quite good with me. One time I kept kicking my left big toe on upturned pavements. I said to him, "Oh, I keep kicking my left toe." He said, "Oh, that's left Nabhi." He said, "There are no such things as accidents." I completely understood what he was saying and how to resolve the issue.

Alan: Saying that about no such thing as an accident, Shri Mataji used to say if anything happened, if you dropped a cup or knocked something over, "Put yourself into bandhan and say Shri Ganesha's mantra." The tiniest thing would come back to your subtle condition.

I was just about to tell you this thing about John. When you worked on John, it was a full-on thing—lots of beating, lots of massage. On this particular occasion, I had a real pain in my Hamsa chakra. It was really painful. John started working on me, and there was a lot of beating involved, lots of fun for him. But this pain just wouldn't go away. Eventually, when John had gotten fed up because everything he was doing didn't get rid of this pain, I decided I was going to shoe-beat it. I went into the garden and said to myself, "I'm going to shoe-beat this until it goes." I was beating away, and on the 3,000th beat on the ground, it suddenly went inside my head like that and completely disappeared.

Laurent: I remember a case where I was sitting alone with her in a room. She was drinking tea and telling me that nothing happened by accident. Even a drop of water falls on a specific spot on the ground—even that's not an accident. As she was saying that, a bit of tea leaked and went down her neck. She said, "When you see this drop of tea coming down here, it's just to point out that you have a problem if you..." It was just to put my attention on the issue right now.

She had this amazing trick she played on me to switch off my brain. I had a tendency to think, obviously, like a few others. There was a case where I was working in the corridor on a skirting board. She arrived in the house, I said, "Namaskar," and gave her a flower. As she walked away, she said in French, "Merci." My brain couldn't take it. You're French, you're in England, she might speak English, but a French word... My brain totally disjuncted from this French word coming from Shri Mataji, and my brain just went pop. I was like this, and I looked over at Shri Mataji, and she looked around with a little look like, "Got you, huh?" She totally pulled the switch.

Interviewer: We should ask Hade his first experience working in Shri Mataji's houses. There's a little bit of a lag on the line. At this point, can we welcome Hade, who's driven all the way from Cabella to Vienna and actually made this session. Thank you so much for joining us. Would you please share your journey in Sahaja Yoga and the first property that you worked on as a golden builder for Shri Mataji?

Hade: Yes. I got my realization in '85, in October '85. I deepened into my realization then in Edinburgh, where the collective was maybe 20-fold at that time. I got my realization out in the sticks in Cupar in Fife. Even though at that time we were still drinking and smoking pot, every time our conversation turned to God, I always felt this feeling of the Kundalini coming up, until I finally went to the first meeting where I met the yogis. For me, it was just obvious that that was it. That was the answer.

The first time I came down to Shudy Camps, it was for the Shri Adi Bhumi Devi Puja. That was quite an experience. We'd already arranged that we'd come down, but I missed the bus they'd rented. I said, "No, I have to go." So I jumped into my car, filled it up with petrol, and started driving down the motorway. Heading down from Scotland to Cambridge, there are about three different ways you could come, but for me, it was like I just started driving. Within about an hour of driving down the motorway, my Kundalini just started getting stronger and stronger. Then all of a sudden, I saw the bus that they'd rented with the yogis inside. They were driving so slow on the motorway. We stopped off at the next lay-by, and then I drove all the way down until we arrived at Shudy Camps around three or four o'clock in the morning.

My Kundalini was soaring. Apparently, they were working on me the whole time I was driving. I thought, "Okay, I'm just going to go for a little walk and have a puff of my cigarette." I was walking down the drive, lit the cigarette, took a puff, and the vibrations went. I looked at the cigarette, knew what it was, threw it away, and that was my last cigarette ever.

Interviewer: What was the first meeting with Shri Mataji like?

Hade: The first time I met Shri Mataji was down in Shudy Camps at the puja. I was just so engrossed and fascinated with the children, because the vibrations from the children were just fantastic. I just found myself playing with the children.

The first time I actually met Shri Mataji was when I came down to work at Shudy Camps. I'd taken two weeks holiday and ended up staying four weeks. I remember just before I left that first time, John telling me, "If you don't come back, I'm going to come and get you." It was his humor, I think we just connected somehow. I was very shy in those days.

The first time really speaking to Shri Mataji, I think, was when she had given out a whole load of presents to yogis. A lot of yogis got a present and I didn't get anything. I was thinking, "Okay, it's not my time." Then Shri Mataji came back from India and she had presents for yogis. She called me and she gave me a watch. At that time, it was one of these Seiko, gold-plated watches she was giving everybody else, and I was just so touched. We didn't really have much of a conversation at Shudy Camps; I wasn't really much of a talker. I was just very happy being there and in the collectivity.

I find the celebrations just held everything together. There were always problems, but there was also fun. We had so much fun being together that the problems were less than the fun we had. The problems became less and less as we grew together.

Greshna: You were wondering how you could cut your hair so your mum doesn't get upset. I remember this. You knew you wanted to cut your hair, but your mum wasn't happy about it.

John: I cut his hair.

Greshna: He had very strong hair. Very long. When it was cut, it was like a really springy bush. I remember it well.

John: There were wonderful times we had together, really. There were always times where the laughter would be out of control.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji used to make everybody laugh. The feeling of joy and tranquility that was there at the same time, it was a different atmosphere in her presence. Would you like to share some of those moments with Shri Mataji when you were working in different properties? Pat, if you'd like to start?

Pat: I remember in Brompton Square, that was the bathroom wall. The builder finished it and said to Shri Mataji, "What do you think?" And she said, "Yes, I like it quite a lot. It's pretty good. But could you just move it about 18 inches that way?"

Interviewer: That's brilliant.

Pat: It was a wooden wall, so we had to take those enormous nails out and demolish the whole thing.

John: Shri Mataji loved it when we were having fun together, and she'd create situations where it would obviously end up being fun. There was myself, Alan, and I'm not sure if it was Laurent or one other person. She got us to put oil on our heads.

Pat: Oh, God.

John: She really got us to put a lot on. That was in Pratisthan.

Pat: That was with you, John. Three of us, sitting together with our heads really oiled. And she was just looking at us and laughing. She said, "Looking like royal family."

Laurent: I remember we walked into Shri Mataji's room in Pratisthan, John and I, to ask a question about the work we had to do. We walked in there and we ended up getting an oil massage each from Shri Mataji. We came out totally blissed out. We had forgotten about the question.

John: Shri Mataji would get us to move furniture around quite a lot. It would often end up as it originally started. But there was one time she was getting us to move lots of mattresses around, and she wanted the mattress from her bed swapped for the mattress at the very top of the house. With the vibrations, we were charging around with these big mattresses. We came charging back into her bedroom where she was waiting, and the other yogi sort of pushed it in a way that made me fall. I fell and the mattress fell on top of me right at Shri Mataji's feet. She absolutely roared with laughter. She really enjoyed the fun. She loved it when we were all having fun. She'd take on these different aspects, like one of the boys, laughing and joking. And the next thing, she'd be Mrs. Srivastava making sweets for Sir CP's diplomatic guests.

Alan: John was actually laughing because we were together. Roaring, we were. And Shri Mataji walked into the room, and just like two naughty schoolboys, we stopped. We said, "Oh, sorry, Mother." And she said, "No, no, I love to see you."

Laurent: Shri Mataji's sense of humor... one time in the little room downstairs in Brompton Square that was used as a workshop, she came down and started working on my Vishuddhi. She was cracking my neck the way she does it, which is very quickly to shock you out of it a little bit. Then the rest of the scene was like out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. We were next to the workbench, and Shri Mataji saw this big claw hammer. She grabbed the hammer and turned to me. I thought, "I'm going to run now." I started running, and she was running after me with the hammer all the way down the corridor. At the end, we both laughed and she said, "Okay, next time we catch a Vishuddhi, I'll treat you like this." I still have the hammer, by the way.

Alan: I just wanted to say about Shri Mataji's creativity. You remember, John, you were doing the plaster moulds for Shri Mataji's bedroom. She used a chocolate box, the top of the chocolate box, as a design.

John: It was an Indian carved table. There were two things: one was a tin and one was a table.

Alan: At that time, I was making the moulds and John was putting them up.

John: That tin, it was a biscuit tin with embossed roses. We cut it out, laid it out, and made a mould from it. It was incredible. We used them all around Mother's bedroom. The roses were painted in gold and pink.

Greshna: Also, she wanted something in the hallway on the ceiling. She asked us to put pieces of glass on the Persian carpets and paint the design of the carpets with glass paint. All these designs of the Persian carpets were up on the ceiling as well.

Laurent: She often made us do things we had absolutely zero idea about. At some point, me and Danny were supposed to make these plaster lines in the big dining room downstairs. We had this wooden thing with a metal profile, and we'd throw the plaster on the wall and run this thing to make the line. Of course, we had no idea about plaster. It would set within seconds. We would throw away two huge buckets of plaster per day and do 30 centimetres on the wall. We tried to put some salt with it, so we mixed salt with the plaster. It started to work, but then the plaster would never dry because it was always so wet from the salt. It was probably one of the worst moments we had, struggling from early morning to late evening.

Pat: The other thing is that she'd come up with completely original ideas. I've got some silk here that Mother got us to use as wallpaper in Brompton Square. It's silk cloth. It's really hard to hang because it moves; it's not stiff. So we had to devise a method to get it on. In Mother's bedroom, the walls were silk, and there would be ornamental plasterwork around the edges and mirrors alternated with this silk wallpaper and the embossed rose design.

John: Incredibly, I managed to do that without putting glue on the silk. You just put the glue on the walls. I'd never done any wallpaper hanging or anything. Everything was learned there. I just used to go into a room and literally guess how many metres. It got to a point where Shri Mataji was telling me off for anything and everything, even things I hadn't done. The negativity was on the run, and it was getting worse and worse.

It came to one of the final rooms, and it suddenly dawned on me while I was putting this silk up that there wasn't going to be enough. I'd been told off so much, I was really thinking I was going to be turned into ashes. I was terrified. I went to Shri Mataji, and she had the usual entourage of people following her around. She said, "Yes, John?" And I really spluttered it out that there wasn't going to be enough silk. But instead of blasting me, she said, "That man in the shop must have cheated me." Everything was all right after that because I was so terrified. It must have driven something out. The telling off stopped, and everything was fine.

Interviewer: There was a wallpaper miracle where Lewis, one of the yogis, had wallpapered to surprise Shri Mataji. But because of wallpaper shrinkage, there was this gap. The next day, Shri Mataji worked on those wallpaper bundles and was saying how we should believe in the vibrations because they do the work. Does that bring any memory?

John: No, but I have heard she pushed the wallpaper together.

Greshna: I just want to mention Shri Mataji's ingenious use of mirrors in her house. The corridor in the entrance was quite small, and she put mirrors facing each other. The corridor looked huge, and you could look into infinity. Also, in the basement where the dining room was, Shri Mataji put mirrors up on the ceiling. The room was quite low, so it suddenly became really tall.

Alan: The dining room was beneath Shri Mataji's bedroom, and like Greshna says, it was quite a low ceiling, but the mirrors made it feel higher. We spent many pleasant times in there with Shri Mataji around the table. After lunch, Shri Mataji used to go to sleep in the afternoon, and we used to go into the dining room and lie on the floor and go to sleep as well. I remember one time, I laid with my head underneath a cabinet and gone to sleep. We were all asleep on the floor, and Shri Mataji walked into the room. We all woke up with a start, and I banged my head on this cabinet. Mother was very amused by it.

John: I remember watching a horror film with Shri Mataji at Brompton Square. You get involved in the movie, but watching it with Shri Mataji, it was tenfold. I was absolutely terrified. There was one part that made us all jump, including Shri Mataji. We all shot back in our chairs, and Shri Mataji was saying, "Baap re!" and all this. She was commenting on everything, saying, "This person is super-conscious. See the way he's doing this," and, "See, nothing's growing there... negativity."

The most Maya-ish situation was watching a video of Shri Mataji with Shri Mataji. She was agreeing with herself and saying, "Such a good actress," and things like that. It got to the point where it was like there were two Shri Matajis—the one in the video and the one in the room. It was a really weird sensation, but it was interesting how she was enjoying her own talk.

Fergie: Do you remember what Shri Mataji said at the end of this vampire film? She said, "The Sahaja Yogis need to watch this film. They have to watch this. That's what will happen to them if they don't make it."

Alan: I've got my hand up because it's so hard to get a word in! Greshna was mentioning the chandeliers. We were in Brompton Square, all in our own little dramas, with Mother untangling the knots within us. Eighty chandeliers had arrived from India, the pink ones. They were being distributed in boxes into the particular rooms. I'd been given the job with the clipboard, noting where each box was supposed to go.

One chandelier went missing; 79 were accounted for. The Sahaja Yogi distributing them came down and said, "Shri Mataji, I can't find this chandelier." She started getting cross with him—it was just a drama, she wasn't really cross, she was working something out in him, but also in me at the same time. She was sending him all over the house, up and down, getting more and more cross. I was standing there with my clipboard, and it slowly dawned on me that there wasn't a chandelier missing. It was my fault. I'd never been blasted, and I was trying to pluck up the courage to say something in preparation for the blasting I was going to get.

Anyway, he'd gone scurrying upstairs. I said, "Shri Mataji, I've just realised that there isn't a missing chandelier. It's my fault on here." She just stopped, looked at me with this beautiful, radiant look, and this smile came across her face. She said, "Yes, I know. But whatever you do, don't tell Richard." I felt very relieved to not get a blasting.

John: We had this very long scaffolding board we called "the plank." Shri Mataji sent me to the very top of the house. Another yogi had two planks, but he was very hot-tempered and blasted me out of the room when I asked for one. So we had to carry this really long one from the basement all the way up, sticking it out of windows to get it around corners. When we got to the top, it got stuck in the loft hatch. Shri Mataji was coming up the stairs with her entourage. She said, "What's going on here?" I said, "We're just trying to get this plank into this room, Shri Mataji."

Next thing I know, Shri Mataji got hold of this plank with me, and we were both moving it backwards and forwards together. All the yogis were just standing there with their hands out, making suggestions. She looked over and said, "Why don't you take one of his planks?" I said, "Well, I did ask, Shri Mataji. He wasn't very keen." Suddenly she just threw it down and shouted this yogi's name very loudly, "Come here!" He came out and she said, "Look at this plank. It's just like you—obstinate. Give him one of your planks." He gave us a plank. Coming back up, I met Shri Mataji on the stairs and she just burst out laughing. It was just a play she created for this guy.

John: When Shri Mataji tells somebody off, it's maximum vibrations. There were about five of us, and one by one she was blasting us. She was in a complete fury with one yogi; she threatened to throw him out of evolution. But I've never felt such strong vibrations. I couldn't move. Everything cleared out.

Pat: We would be working 12-hour days, seven days a week, and getting blasted by Shri Mataji for all kinds of things all the time. Then a puja would come, and someone would do a little dance in front of her for five minutes and get praised to the skies.

Also, we'd be working really late, sometimes through the night, and we'd all stagger off to bed. Just as we were about to nod off, the door would fly open and someone would enthusiastically say, "Shri Mataji has invited us all to watch a movie!" And instead of saying, "Great!" we'd all go, "Oh no..."

I just couldn't face it one night. I said, "I can't do it." Then I thought, "Oh, I'll have to go." I staggered upstairs and stuck my head in the door. Shri Mataji gave me a big smile and said, "I hear you're very tired, Pat." Then we would remember watching hours of films in Marathi with laughing rakshasas with big moustaches. We'd all be sitting there with our heads nodding.

Interviewer: It was a very significant time in laying the foundation for the new Jerusalem. Was there any other aspect Shri Mataji took care of for design and auspicious purposes?

Pat: In Pratisthan, she designed everything from beginning to end and was incredibly creative. The architects who were there were completely bamboozled. She designed these pillars made of bricks; she just worked it out by building it up with her hands. The stonework at the front of Pratisthan, she bought from some palace in Rajasthan, I think, and had it all reassembled. The whole thing was just designed from beginning to end.

They built the main staircase, but Mother didn't like it. She kept telling them to knock it down and start again. As soon as she was driving away on another tour, the architects would start arguing, "Mother surely couldn't mean that we should take them down." The last time she came back and said, "What do I have to do? Take a hammer and break it myself?" She got them to knock it all down and rebuild it.

John: In Cabella, she actually designed all those pillars on the stairs. It got to the point where she didn't say anything; she knew I knew which coving went in which room. In Ealing, I was given free rein. While I was putting the three angels up above the reception in Cabella, I had all these people coming up to me saying, "Did she actually ask you to put them up?" But I just carried on. When she came back, she looked up and said, "Wow." It was a glorious entrance to Shri Mataji's apartment.

In Ealing, I put all Shri Ganeshas within the coving in her bathroom. She was calling Sir CP to come and see it. We were very, very lucky.

Fergie: The Ganesha which John was talking about, I found it in a shop in Fulham called Ganesh. I saw this little Ganesh, bought it, and then we took a mould of that. We've since made casts and gave it as a puja present one year. So things are still going on now.

Interviewer: As much as Shri Mataji encouraged us to use handmade and natural things, at the same time, she was very practical. Is there any instance that comes to mind?

Laurent: There is a story about the kitchen. We had all these oak doors for the kitchen with this arched shape at the top. When the kitchen was coming to an end, there were two cabinets which were open because we didn't have doors that fit. We had two doors which would have fit in the width, but one was longer and one was shorter. I said to Shri Mataji, "We could leave it open, put a glass front or something." She said, "No, turn the doors around." So you have the rounded bits at the top. I said, "I'll turn the door like this and then cut them to length." But I said, "You can't put this rounded shape on the side; that doesn't belong to the style." She said, "No, it's Nirmala style. You do it."

So I had to fix the doors sideways like that which, for my conditioned ego coming from a carpentry school... And she said, "No, that's Nirmala style." And if it wasn't enough to tickle my ego, every time a yogi came in the house, they would look at the door and say, "Oh, you put the door the wrong way around!" I'd say, "It wasn't me!" Every single time.

Alan: I was doing some work in Shri Mataji's bathroom and I remember finding lots of her hair. I didn't know it at the time, but Shri Mataji has to give permission for you to have her hair. Anyway, I gathered up this hair and put it in a little wooden box. I had it for years. Then somebody said, "You shouldn't have Shri Mataji's hair unless she gives it to you." I started to get really panicky about this box of hair I had.

So we took this box of hair... In Bristol, we have the triangular dock, which is the Kundalini of Bristol. We went down there to the middle of the Kundalini of Bristol, sang Shri Ganesha's names and Shri Mataji's mantras, and offered the little box of hair into the water. It was a day when the sky was absolutely blue, not a cloud in the sky. As we got to the end of Shri Mataji's mantra, the vibrations were really strong. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we got this little shower of rain on our heads. In this clear blue sky, there was one tiny cloud just above our heads, as though it was a sort of confirmation that we'd done the right thing.

Laurent: There were moments she'd talk about more spiritual things. One time she was explaining to me that you can combine mantras, up to three names together, and you don't put "Shri" before each one. The example was "Nirmala Vidya Gwalakshmi Vishnu Maya."

And there was a funny story. At the beginning, I was very new. I'd heard of foot soak, but that's as far as it went. One day, I was sitting with Shri Mataji alone, and she was telling me about a yogi who got an epileptic fit. I could really see, wow, Shri Mataji really sees and knows everything. Then she looked at me with big eyes and said, "And just imagine, he wasn't even doing foot soak every day." I was shaking inside. After Shri Mataji left, I went straight to the shop, bought a bucket, and put my feet in it. She had a very subtle way to tell you very directly.

Hade: At one point in Cabella, Shri Mataji said to me that I should do more candle treatment than foot soak. She told me I shouldn't foot soak every day. Everyone's different. There's nothing set in stone.

John: I took seven lemons and seven chillies to Shri Mataji to vibrate. I said, "Shri Mataji, can you vibrate these for me, please?" She said, "What are you going to do with these?" I said, "I'm going to put them under my pillow." She said, "No, no, no. You've got to eat them."

Pat: At Pratisthan, the geometry created out of the bricks for the pillars was amazing. I was there in April, May, June of '87.

Interviewer: It must have been something very challenging for all of you.

Laurent: John and I were probably each other's favorite enemy within Sahaja Yoga. There was a sort of love-hate relationship. One time in Pratisthan, John became sick; he had jaundice, something quite severe. Shri Mataji told me, "Go and work on John." I didn't really want to come near him, to be honest. But I went to him, worked on him, and I remember that ever since, he's been my best friend. I don't remember ever having a bad feeling for him since that moment. Shri Mataji fixed that nicely.

Pat: A little bit about Pratisthan. After I'd been there a short time, these Indian mafia people were trying to get hold of the land. They persuaded the local collector to stop the building work. There was no law describing what kind of building you could have on agricultural land, and Mother used that loophole to build that huge palace. Anyway, they got the police to come and serve a warrant saying we had to stop work. The guy Mother had given power of attorney to signed a form agreeing to knock it down. When Mother came back, she found out all this was going on. She said, "No, if you stop work, it'll never start again." She got a psychiatrist yogi to write a thing saying the guy had lost his mind, so his authority to sign the form was removed. That is typical of her amazing way of finding ways out of problems.

Greshna: I can tell you a story from Brompton Square. Once I came, and Shri Mataji came downstairs looking very unwell. I was quite worried. She was complaining about the human body, saying, "This annoying, sticky thing." I suppose for a goddess to fit into a human body, it's not easy. She came down, touched the ground floor, and suddenly she changed into a young girl, completely different. She was gliding over the surface of the floor. We were working together all day in complete harmony. At the end of the day, Shri Mataji looked at me and said, "You have done a lot of work today, haven't you?" It was an amazing experience to see her transform from one aspect to another.

Alan: It's in the early days of my carpentry lessons with Shri Mataji. She asked me to build a cupboard in her bathroom. It involved wood. I spent a couple of hours trying to find the perfect piece of wood. I measured the space, measured the wood, checked again, marked the wood, and cut it. I offered it into the space, and to my horror, it was an inch short. I thought, "Oh, no." At that very moment, Shri Mataji walked into the bathroom. She could see I was a bit upset. She said, "Is everything all right, Alan?" I said, "Mother, I spent ages looking for this piece of wood, I've measured it, I've cut it, and now it's an inch too short." She just gave me that knowing look and said, "Are you sure?" I said, "Yes, Mother, I measured it twice." She said, "Just try it. Put it in the space." I put it into the space, and it fit perfectly. She sort of smiled and walked off, looking very satisfied.

Fergie: When you come in the front door at Brompton Square, that first staircase there, I remember being there and looking around. Shri Mataji was at the bottom of the stairs. I turned around, and when I turned back, she was already at the top. I was flabbergasted. She said, "Oh, it's Shri Hanuman. He carries me everywhere," and she just carried on walking.

Hade: I'd go back to Pratisthan, '88. I had a very long train ride from my family in North India and arrived at Pratisthan. My glasses were broken, so Fergie and I went to Pune to find an optician. We didn't know Shri Mataji was waiting for me. When we came back, she was angry and wanted to see me. She sort of blasted me and said, "If you carry on like this, then you might as well leave." I said, "No, if you want me to work, I'll work. I'm here to work." It was a shock, but then you automatically have to decide why you're here, what you're doing. She got me doing the plumbing in the house. I'd never really done plumbing. In the end, I ended up doing all the main runs of all the steel piping up to the swimming pool on the roof.

Most nights, Shri Mataji invited us into her apartment, and we either watched movies with her or had spontaneous pujas. We were allowed to offer kumkum to her feet. Other days, she would just sit there and talk to us. It was very elevating. You'd work hard the whole day, sit with Shri Mataji until one or two in the morning, then be up again at six o'clock. It was a very special stay.

Interviewer: Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you first and foremost to Shri Mataji for giving us this opportunity to remember these times with her. Thank you all for joining us.
