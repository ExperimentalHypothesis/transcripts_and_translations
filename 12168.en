3rd Day of Navaratri

So many powers Mother has to have to protect her children and to look after them. These powers are all there, working relentlessly all the time-24 hours. So anybody who surrenders to Mother, these powers express themselves and try to help you out of your problems. But first thing is surrendering. If you are not surrendered, if you are not in the kingdom of the God, then this is not the responsibility of the Mother. Then it might be hat some negative force might take over and may destroy you.
