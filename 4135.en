Then you wont feel the strain, because going back I know what it is to travel. So how was the experience here were you happy— and all the married couples are they happy, you look so nice and so beautiful, now i’ve given quite a big lecture this morning I think and I didn’t talk much about it, but we have to develop personality that’s important. That personality which is of course inside, you are growing very much, but in relationship with that personality, you have to develop a personality which is, dignified, which is impressive, which makes feel, other’s happy, because from you they will judge, if you are frivolous and if you are cheapish type, even because of may be your age whatever it is, still people will start thinking that something wrong with these people.

So, we have to develop personality, a personality which is inside us, is that of your spirit and that is so dignified, so beautiful and so natural, but naturalness never means frivolity or stupidity it doesn’t means that.
Naturally a human being, even an animal is sensible thing, so human beings are naturally very sensible, very loving, happy, joyous and good creation of God, but it is not yet known to Sahaja Yogi’s that your personality impresses others much more than your talk about Sahaja Yoga. 

Like Dhumal went a office of collector and the way he was talking, the way he was handling, the way he was so natural and so good and kind, the people in the collector’s office asked him who is your Guru, how you are talking like this, how do you know application so well, how can you solve the problems like this, and he said I have no Guru but one Mother only, they said everyone has Mother. He said. There’s a special Mother I have got, and the whole thing worked out so well that in that collector’s office now. Poor collector doesn’t know how to stand against me because everybody is with me, so that is very important, what sort of personality you are, some of you people look as you are blasted with worries, troubles on your head, as if something terrible has happened and some of you look has if you are not bothered about anything in the world. You are not aware of what is happening in the world, or that you have to do something about it, so to be responsible to be conscious of yourself. Yesterday Shivaji’s lecture was about his own son, he got dejected and he felt depressed and he felt that he has not been able to look after his family people,to put them right and that he failed them and then again he came out, and he said no that’s not the thing.

I am here to do a job and my son whatever he has done, he’s done because he’s a frivolous person. He is not the one who is of my time, I’m different type of a person, I’m the one who tried always to become a saviour for the Marathas here and how can I give up, how can I forget it, for one son of mine if he has given up doesn’t matter, so he came up on his own style, he saw for himself, sometime as I told you I also feel little dejected sometimes too, now because I love you so much, and when I find there something very wrong with the people who am I love so much, I Get upset, but then then again start thinking. Oh no. I am Adi Shakti, I can’t be upset. I can not give up just I can’t give up, I have to continue, I have to love them, I have to correct them, I have to look after them and I have to go ahead with it, that’s keeps you alright, that’s what you have to always suggest yourself I’m Sahaja Yogini, I’m Sahaja Yogi how can I feel depressed about it, how can I behave like this, always if you remember you are a Yogi, you are a special type of a person, you are very, very, rare, compared to the population of this world. How many we are very few, very rare, very rare species of people and very rare type of people, we have to be very proud of ourselves and we have to always be very aware that we are this and we are this, and we have to be this and we have to be different.

We shouldn’t worry about people who are not like us, pity them, their fate is sleeping somewhere, something has gone wrong with their fate, they didn’t do good work in their last life perhaps, may be that they are not yet blessed but they are after all, can be they are our relations and they are connected people doesn’t matter. We have to lift them up, somebody has to stand up like Shivaji stood up all his family people were funny, he stood up, he said no I have to do it. In the same way one should not get dissolved or disturbed by anything that’s happening around. You have to dissolve other people, you are not to get dissolved into them, this is what it is and that can come with full confidence in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga and in the love of your Mother.

May God Bless You!

Part2.
Today, I would like to announce one thing that I have thought of having two senior Sahaja Yogi leaders like James and Guido, to be selected among us spontaneously, not to any election or anything, to be consulted for anything that you want to be done, instead of consulting me because sometimes it happens that I’m not available, sometimes may be that you don’t feel like talking to me about certain things. 

So these two persons are there whom you can always contact, ask their advice and they are in charge about all the affairs of the leaders and the people who are around them, and then I can consult them, I can talk to them, they can save out whatever they don’t want to tell me and tell me whatever is to be told to me and what argue the part they want to know, though I know everything. Even if you don’t tell me anything, even if you do it behind seven curtains, of seven countries I know everything. I must say, I just know, and how do I know that I can’t tell you, and I think if you love someone you know everything about that person, but I know about Sahaja Yoga and I know what’s happening where.

Nobody should ever believe that somebody told me something against someone, or things like that. If no one can tell me, you see they might tell me, but I don’t listen, they are free to tell me but I know what it is. I know much more then he knows, I’ll give an example: there was an one fellow who was very active and he was trying to help us to have some programmes in the nearby the village. I said, “That’s a good idea”. And some of the Sahaja Yogis, local Sahaja Yogis felt that Mother don’t know about this fellow better go and tell him. So they came to me with very serious faces all of them, five or six of them drove on motor cycles came all the way to that guest house, and sat down around it very seriously. He said, “Mother do you know this fellow is a politician he will play around with you, and he will try to trouble”. I said, “Really?” They said, “Yes”. They were very seriously, and they said now all the wrong things about that fellow you know that he is capable of a debacle, or he may try to create a problem for Sahaja Yoga. I said, “That’s all you know?” I said, “All right, I’ll tell you what I know about, that this man has a wife, who is not his wife he has eloped with that lady and the child he has got from her, that’s why he is staying there, he is of this caste and his wife is of another caste”. All those thing they were just looking. I said, “Have you got more to tell me?” They took their motor cycles and ran away.

So, you are not to be afraid of that if somebody is supposed to be a very bad man, or something evil, or any thing like, they are like frogs for me just like a manage them without any difficulty. I just try to do the things in a way that looks human and simple, but I am quite complicated and I can manage thing so well, you won’t even know how I manage, so under these circumstances you must give up all fears that anybody can put something into my head and tell me against somebody, or that my mind can be spoiled against somebody, nothing of the kind, have faith in me, in the system. Now some of you might be wanting, somebody might be wanting, say to marry an Indian or somebody might be wanting to marry an American, whatever was wanting may be. But on vibrations I have judged your couples and I thought this should work out well, but you must co-operative with me, from the very beginning if you start finding faults with another person for small small things, then you are not co-operative, of course nobody is made to order you see, that now this is one person ‘A’, so another is made to order for ‘B’.

Now the eight things that other person should make to order, according to the needs of ‘A’ and the ‘B’ things that the ‘A’ should make to order for the person that is ‘B’. So ‘A & B’ have two thoughts about each other, one wants this kind and another wants that kind, now both are wanting that, that person himself is important and another person has to be complementary, you could be, you could be, if you understand that there’s nothing basically wrong between Sahaja Yogi’s basically alright. There could be little bit differences, there could be little bit disparities, something could be there, has to be. After all God has created this universe with variety to create joy and happiness, supposing if you see only your image in the mirror all the time, not your wife and then you say what is this Mother has married me to myself or what? so that the woman has to be different, the man has to be different, some chance of knowing each other, otherwise if you are exactly replica of yourself you are married, you say i’ve had enough of it now. So one has to agree and accept with joy, happiness and also with curiosity, to know why Mother has married her to me, there must be something, this is how you can make your life much more interesting and happy, you have to learn, you have to learn, you have to see things, seeing is the point, you must see why this has come up.

But immediately as soon as you are married you pounce upon each other and try to find faults with each other, that person is like this, that person like this, what is about yourself you see and another person, if you are they tell you the same defect you have. So, this habit of giving certificate another to another person is not very good because there’s no end to it, it’s only your mind playing around with you, befouling you. There’s nothing to certify other, now think about me, if I thought like this, first of all I never have come to this earth, because human being you know they have horns, they have funny, funny things with them you see to come among them you don’t know where you will land, it’s not an easy thing to be with human being you know they’re quite funny stuffs, easy to be with dogs, animals you know, where they stand because they have definite temperaments you know, you know the dog will bark, but a human being will bark and shout and kick like a donkey and do anything, because it has passed through many lives of these animals, It has all acquired all the bad qualities, as well as good qualities of those animals, is a bundle of all these things and you don’t know what is the dominant on one person, what is dominant on another, so not easy thing, but I just thought out of curiosity, let’s have a look, may be I might be able to manage and it has worked. In the same fashion if you can look at your married life, I think you can do well don’t take that seriously because my wife’s hair like this, because she was not wearing her spectacles properly or she was clumsy in this way isn’t it, nothing so great, human being is a much bigger thing then all these small little things and that’s how if you can look at other people with that kind of graciousness with that feeling of companionship, we’ll all enjoy each other and also enjoy your wives or your husband whatever may be the case, alright. So now we have appointed two person as the leaders, we should say but I will not call international leaders all that I don’t know what’s goes wrong with that, so now they are to be consulted, then I would say that Engelbert can now take to studies and he has to really study very hard and we will appoint Marcus as the leader for Austria.
Anybody as who wants to give up the leadership just now can suggest Now, who thinks that it is too much because like Engelbert’s case he Has to work very hard, he has to study now, he has to devote his Time and he should not diverted from his work in the same way if ...

Anybody feels that way time comes know and say that and we can Manage, which your marriage, be courageous there’s nothing to worry, Its an adventure, it’s an adventure as you see, if you take aAdventure, if you take.Iwill tell you easiest adventure is to get Married easiest.You don’t have to climb a mountain, you don’t have To cross a river, you don’t have even climb a tree, it is so simple As that,

Shri Mataji: How many have you to report at 10 o’clock on the 17th night – 16th night?
Sahaja Yogi: 10pm at the airport, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ten o’clock.
Sahaja Yogi: First flight for Swiss and French.
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Other Sahaja Yogi: What time?
Sahaja Yogi: First flight for Swiss and French.
Shri Mataji: So, how? What time?
Sahaja Yogi: The flight is at about one o’clock.
Shri Mataji: What time you have to report?
Sahaja Yogi: Two hours before.
Shri Mataji: That’s the first flight.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: You have lot of time then! Then you need not go, you see, that early. You can go about say five o’clock or so, will be all right. But better is four (o’clock)... [Interruption in video]... don’t take eight hours as such, but you can have some nice rest there and then you won’t feel the strain, because going back I know how, what it is to travel.
So, how was the experience here, were you happy?
Sahaja Yogis: Yes! (Applause)
Shri Mataji: And all the married couples are they happy?
Sahaja Yogis: Yes! (Applause)
Shri Mataji: You all look so nice and so beautiful. Now, I’ve given quite a big lecture this morning I think, and I need not talk much about it – but we have to develop a personality. That’s important. That personality which is – of course inside you are growing very much, but in relationship with that personality you have to develop a personality which is dignified, which is impressive, which makes feel others happy.
Because from you they will judge. If you are frivolous, and if you are cheapish type, even because of maybe your age or whatever it is, still people will start thinking that there’s something wrong with these people.
So we have to develop a personality – a personality which is inside us, is that of your Spirit, and that is so dignified, so beautiful and so natural.
But naturalness never means frivolity, or stupidity. It doesn’t mean that. Naturally a human being, even an animal, is a sensible thing. So human beings are naturally very sensible, very loving, happy, joyous, and good creation of God.
But it is not yet known to Sahaja Yogis, that your personality impresses others much more than your talk about Sahaja Yoga.
Like Dhumal went to a office of collector. And the way he was talking, the way he was handling, the way he was so natural and so good and kind, the people in the collectorate asked him : “Who is your Guru? How you are talking like this, how do you know everything so well? How can you solve problems like this?”
Then he said, “I’ve no Guru, I’ve one Mother only”. He said: “Everybody has mother”. But he said: “There’s a special Mother I’ve got”. [Laughter] And the whole thing [Shri Mataji laughs] worked out so well that in that collectorate office now, poor collector doesn’t know how to stand against Me, because everybody is with Me! [Laughter]
So that is very important what sort of a personality you have.
Now, some of you people look as if you are blasted with worries, troubles on your head, as if something terrible has happened. And some of you look as if you are not bothered about anything in the world, you are not aware of what is happening in the world, or that you have to do something about it. So to be responsible, to be conscious of yourself.
Yesterday Shivaji’s lecture was about his own son: he got dejected and he felt depressed.
And he felt that he has not been able to look after his family people, to put them right, and that he has failed there. And then again he came up, he said : “No. That’s not the thing, I’m here to do a job! And my son, whatever he’s done, he’s done because he’s a frivolous person.
He’s not the one who is of my type. I’m a different type of a person. And I’m the one who has tried always to become a savior for the Marathas here, and how can I give up? How can I forget it ? For one son of mine, if he has given up, doesn’t matter”. And so he came up on his own style he’s offered himself.
Sometimes as I told you I also feel little dejected sometimes, too I, now, because I love you so much and when I find there’s something very wrong with the people whom I love so much I get upset. But then again I just start thinking “Oh no, I’m Adi Shakti, I can’t be upset! [Laughter and applause].
I cannot give up, just I can’t give up, I have to continue, I have to love them, I’ve to correct them, I’ve to look after them, and I have to go ahead with it”. That keeps Me alright. That’s what you have to always suggest yourself: “I’m a Sahaja Yogini, I’m a Sahaja Yogi.
How can I feel depressed about it? How can I behave like this?”
Always if you remember, you are a Yogi, you are a special type of a person, you are very, very rare compared to the population of this world. How many we are? Very few, very rare, very rare species of people and very rare type of people. We have to be very proud of ourselves, and we have to always be very aware that we are this, and we are this and we have to be this, and we have to be different. We shouldn’t worry about people who are not like us; pity them. Their fate is sleeping somewhere, something has gone wrong with their fate, they didn’t do good work in their last life perhaps, maybe that they are not yet blessed. But they are after all, can be, they are our relations, and they are our connected people, doesn’t matter. We have to lift them up. Somebody has to stand up like Shivaji stood up. All his family people were funny, he stood up, he said: “No, I have to do it”.
In the same way, one should not get dissolved or disturbed by anything that’s happening around. You have to dissolve other people, you are not to get dissolved into them.
This is what it is and that can come with full confidence in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga and in the love of your Mother.
May God bless you.

Today I would like to announce one thing, that I’ve thought of having two senior Sahaja Yogi leaders, like James and Guido, to be selected among us – spontaneously, not through any election or anything – to be consulted for anything that you want to be done. Instead of consulting Me, because sometimes it happens that I’m not available. Sometimes may be that you don’t feel like talking to Me about certain things, so these two persons are there whom you can always contact, ask their advice and they are in charge about all the affairs of the leaders and the people who are around them.
And then I can consult them, I can talk to them, they can sieve out whatever they don’t want to tell Me, and tell Me whatever is to be told to Me [Shri Mataji laughs] and whatever part they want to know. Though I know everything! [Laughter and applause. Shri Mataji laughs].
Even if you don’t tell Me anything, even if you do it behind seven curtains of seven countries, I know everything – I must say! [Laughter and applause. Shri Mataji laughs.] I just know!
And how do I know that I can’t tell you. [Shri Mataji laughs heartily]. And I think if you love someone you know everything about that person, but I know about Sahaja Yoga and I know what’s happening where.
Nobody should ever believe that somebody has told Me something against someone or things like that. It nobody can tell Me. You see, they might tell Me but I don’t listen [laughter]. They are free to tell Me, but I know what it is. I know much more than he knows.
I’ll give you an example. There was one fellow who was very active and he was trying to help us to have some programs in the nearby village. I said: “That’s a good idea”. And some of the Sahaja Yogis, local Sahaja Yogis felt that: “Mother doesn’t know about this fellow, we’d better go and tell him”. So they came to Me with very serious faces, all of them, five-six of them, drove on motorcycles, came all the way to that guest-house and sat down around Me.
Very seriously. They said: “Mother, do you know this fellow, he’s a politician. He’ll play around with You, and he’ll try to trouble You”. I said: “Really?”. [laughter] They said “Yes”. They were very serious. And they said: “Now, all the wrong things about that fellow, we know that he is capable of a debacle or he may try to create a problem for Sahaja Yoga”.
I said: “That’s all you know? – I said – Alright, I’ll tell you what I know about him. That this man has a wife who is not his wife, he has eloped with that lady, and the child he’s got from her – that’s why he’s staying there – is of this caste and his wife is of another caste”. All those things, and they were just looking like that. [Shri Mataji open Her eyes widely]. They said – I said: “Have you got more to tell Me?”. They took their motorcycles and ran away. [Big laughter].
So you are not to be afraid of, that if somebody is supposed to be a very bad man, or something evil, or anything like that. They are like frogs for Me, just like I manage them without any difficulties. I just try to do things in a way that looks human and simple, but I’m quite complicated [Big laughter]. And I can manage things so well that you won’t even know how I managed.
So, under these circumstances, you must give up all fears that anybody can put something into My head and tell Me against somebody, or that My mind can be spoiled against somebody, nothing of the kind. Have faith in Me in this respect.

Now, some of you might be wanting, somebody might be wanting say, to marry an Indian, or somebody might be wanting to marry an American, whatever was wanting, maybe. But on vibrations I’ve judged your couples and I thought this should work out well.
But you must co-operate with Me. From the very beginning if you start finding faults with the another person, for small, small things, then you are not co-operating. Of course nobody is made-to-order, you see, that now this is one person, A, so another is made-to-order for B. Now, the A thinks that another person should be made-to-order according to the needs of A. And the B thinks that the A should be made-to-order for the person that is B. So A and B have two thoughts about each other. One wants this kind and another wants that kind. Now, both are wanting that that person himself is important and the another person has to be complementary.
You could be, you could be if you understand that there’s nothing basically wrong, between Sahaja Yogis, basically. Alright, there could be little bit differences, there could be little bit of disparities, something could be there. Has to be! After all God has created this universe with variety to create joy and happiness. Supposing if you see only your image in the mirror all the time, not your wife, then you’ll say: “What is this? Mother has married me to myself or what?”. [Laughter]
So the woman has to be different, the man has to be different, there’s some chance of knowing each other, otherwise if you are exactly the replica of yourself you have married, you’ll say “I’ve had enough of it now!” So, one has to agree, and accept with joy, happiness and also with curiosity, to know “Why Mother has married her to me, there must be some reason”. This is how you can make your lives much more interesting and happy. You have to learn, you have to learn, you have to see things, see is the point – you must see why this has come up. But immediately as soon as you are married, you prounce upon each other and try to find faults with each other. “That person is like this, that person is like that”. What about yourself, you see? And the another person if you ask they’ll tell you the same defects that you have. So this habit of giving certificates to another person is not very good. Because there’s no end to it. It’s only your mind playing around with you, befooling you. There’s nothing to certify other – now think about Me: if I thought like this first of all I would never have come to this Earth, because human beings you know they have horns and they have funny, funny things with them, you see?
To come among them you don’t know where You will land (laughter). It’s not a easy thing to be with human beings, you know, they are quite funny stuffs. Easy to be with dogs, animals, you know where they stand, because they have definite temperaments, you know, you know a dog will bark. But a human being can bark, can shout, can kick like a donkey – can do anything! Because it has passed through many lives of these animals, so it has all acquired all the bad qualities, as well as good qualities of those animals, is a bundle of all these things, and you don’t know what is dominant on one person, or what is dominant in another. [Shri Mataji laughs].

So it’s not a easy thing; but I just thought out of curiosity “Just have a look.” [Laughter].
Maybe I might be able to manage them”. And it has worked! In the same fashion if you can look at your married life, I think you can do well. Don’t take that seriously: “Because my wife had a hair like this, because she was not wearing her spectacles properly, or she was clumsy in this way.” It’s nothing! Nothing so great. Human being is a much bigger thing than all these small little things. And that’s how if you can look at other people with that kind of graciousness, with that feeling of companionship, you’ll all enjoy each other and also enjoy your wives or your husband whatever may be the case.

Alright. So now we have appointed two persons as the leaders, we should say, but I’ll not call international leaders and all that, I don’t know what goes wrong with them. So now, they are to be consulted.
Then I would say that Engelbert can now take to his studies because he has to really study very hard, and we’ll appoint Marcus as the leader for Austria. (Applause)
Anybody else who wants to give up the leadership just now can suggest now. Who thinks that it is too much. Because you see, like Engelbert’s case he has to study very hard, he has to study now, he has to devote his time, and he should not be diverted from his work.
In the same way, if anybody feels that way can come now and say that, and we can manage.

Are you happy now with Spanish leadership? Jose Antonio? You are. And with your marriage? (Laughter) Good. Be courageous! There’s nothing to worry. It’s a venture, it’s a venture, you see, as you take any venture you should take – actually the easiest venture is to get married (laughter). Easiest.
You don’t have to climb a mountain, you don’t have to cross a river, you don’t even to climb a tree (laughter)!
It is so simple as that! Now, how are you Pearson, are you alright? May God bless you. And Jason, are you alright?
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What about the other part of Jason (laughter)? Is she alright? Good! And Pearson – who is the lady?
Yogi: Ingrid.
Shri Mataji: Ingrid.
Yogi: She’s at the back, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Are you alright? Good! You are - your name is so sweet, isn’t it, Ingrid – there’s a very nice actress with that name, and I always enjoyed her acting. Because she was always sort of lost in the acting very well, as if she was a realized soul, I felt, Ingrid Bergman. She was very good actress.

MEDITATION ON RIGHT SIDE

So. Now what is the suggestion?
(Shri Mataji first rubs Her right thigh. Then She shows right thumb to people:)
Everyone. Still. So I would suggest put your right hand towards Me and left hand up. Right hand towards Me – and left hand up.

[Shri Mataji keeps right hand on Her lap and left hand up for some seconds. Then She starts blowing into the microphone twice.
After She has finished, some sort of wind noise is heard from the microphone. Shri Mataji smiles, yogis laugh]
Shri Mataji: (laughing) See – did you hear that?
Yogi: Yes...
[Shri Mataji blows again into the microphone then seems to say: “Just see”. Then She blows 5 times into the microphone. Then conversation in Hindi where Vishuddhi is mentioned.

Some Indian yogi says: “...right Vishuddhi...”. Then She starts shaking right hand towards the floor]
Shri Mataji: Just do it yourself.
Right Vishuddhi, right (thumb) (She shakes again right hand and blows on right thumb).
[She blows again into the microphone seven times, then shakes again right hand towards the floor, and rubs Her right hand with left hand. Then She blows several times on Her right thumb]
Shri Mataji: I think put your left hand on your liver. [Shri Mataji puts Her right hand on Her liver and left hand forward with palm upwards.] Left hand on your liver.

[Then She shakes again right hand, She blows again on Her right thumb, then blows again into the microphone twice. Then blows again on right thumb, then into the microphone five times]
Now just watch Me without thinking. And forgive, forgive, forgive. Forgive everyone, forgive everyone. Best is to say once “Lord’s Prayer”.
Yogis: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
(Hindi... “music”...) (Shri Mataji touches Her bindi with right ring finger)
Forgive, forgive (She traces a cross several times near Her Agnya). Forgive.
... music.
Yogis: Can you arrange your music program, singing program?
Shri Mataji: Watch Me here. Put your attention to My red spot here.
It’s better.
You don’t have a harmonium? Harmonium... (hindi)?
Yogi: Before that we will sing the three Mantras.
Yogis: Om twameva Sakshat Shri Mahalakshmi Mahasaraswati Mahakali Trigunatmika Kundalini Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.
Om twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.
Om twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Sahasrara Swamini Moksha Pradayini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha. Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

[Conversation with yogis continues]
Are you leaving all your mattresses with some people here, in Bombay, or where? The mattresses you’ve got. Alright, please leave them here. Whatever things you want to leave, sleeping bags or anything, you leave it here.
(Musicians get ready to play)
Now. He’s trying to play the tabla.
[Music begins, yogis sing “He Adi Ma”]

Shri Mataji: (Shri Mataji starts singing together with the sahaja yogis) Wah.
Wah! Beautiful! (She continues singing).

He has really picked up our Indian style of playing, I must say. Just see this! (Shri Mataji laughs, seeing one Indian yogi who offers money to the violinist to keep playing)

Really, you see, this is called as kanas, which is in between you see, how to tilt the notes, is a speciality, is a - and ours is a melody – may God bless you – ours is a melody, it doesn’t go kikikikikikikiki like that (Laughter). Not at all. It’s a melody, you see, it goes in a melodious way, it’s a continuous thing – it’s not like that, you see, that three person (going?) kekekeke kekekeke (laughter), it doesn’t move like that!

It’s a melody, you see? Just this is the difference between the two.
And once Ravi Shankar was to play with Yehudi Menuhin. Poor fellow, he was playing with him like a child, you know, with another – he didn’t know what to do, because he is so good and so versatile.
And the way he seats and everything he has picked up is very easy to play that way, this is Indian devices (Shri Mataji laughs) than to stand up, you see?
The melody is a melody after all, we don’t believe in all that: we believe in the melody part, that it should be continuous, flowing continuously. It’s beautiful. Now, which one you are going to sing?

[Yogis start singing Raghupati Ram. Shri Mataji starts singing with them. Shri Mataji: “I know the song”, and She hands back the song book to a yogini]

Shri Mataji: So now, which one?
[Guido and Italians start singing Ciuri Ciuri]

Shri Mataji: (Laughing) Italians are. They are like Indians!

[An Indian yogi offers money to the Italian singers.
Shri Mataji says some words – but they are inaudible. Short video interruption.
Then music program continues]
