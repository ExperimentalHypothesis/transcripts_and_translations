...for many flowers to become fruits.

So this happening doesn't take much time, it’s just [a] split of a second in many people. But about the growth I was talking last time, I ended up at Self-realisation, what is Self-realisation is and what do we expect from Self-realisation. The first thing that happens to you, as you know, when the Kundalini rises, [is] that you start feeling physically better, your health improves also. Though the Kundalini rises from the centre most nadi, called as Brahma Nadi, inside the Sushumna, in the central part. And first thing that happens it the physical being which is helped. That is not the innermost core of every centre. The innermost core of every centre is the spiritual. But how is it [that] first the physical being is helped? Is very interesting to see. The Kundalini rises through many centres, passes through Agya, pierces through fontanelle, and becomes one with the All-pervading Power. So first thing that receives the information is the seat of Sadashiva, is the seat of your Atma, your Spirit, on top of your head. But the Spirit is in your heart.

So the first awakening takes place, or enlightenment takes place in your brain. It’s a very important point to be seen. In your brain resides the conscious mind, that means the present, and when it is enlightened that means your awareness is enlightened, you get enlightenment in your awareness, in your attention. As I told you last time that attention is enlightened first. So through your attention you can find out what is the matter with other persons, you can find out what centres are catching, what your centres are catching. So on the physical level you know what’s happening. That’s the, we should say, the present. We feel our gross (physical) being enlightened, we can feel them on our fingers. But when the Kundalini is rising in your being, She goes straight on to the fontanelle bone area. Of course, if there is a hurdle or anything then She stops and tries to indicate. At that time if She is not successful, for example you have got a liver problem, then She will come and throb at liver problem, informing you that there’s something wrong with the liver. That’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to give vibration from outside.

When the Kundalini rises above the Agya, She goes up to this fontanelle and pierces, but when She cannot go beyond Agya, She spreads out here. She can spread out here also. And then She starts trickling down, the grace on the…or you can say She starts relaxing this area which is called as murdha (brain) and that’s how She makes more space in the Agya. And this relaxation works out the outer side of the physical being.

Also when She pierces through in anyone who has a simpler personality, who is not so complicated, first thing that happens is that the grace starts falling through from the sides, and the Grace starts falling into the Ida and Pingala and then She comes down by which She supplies Ida and Pingala. The Grace, not the Kundalini, we should not confuse these two. Because of Her piercing, there’s an opening made and the Grace starts coming down, and She, I should say the Grace Herself, feeds all the centres from outside. So the first, the physical being is gross.

The second one, I’m now going from outside inside. The second one is the mental being. Now the mental being relates to our awareness as well, also to our sense of understanding, intellect and all those things. When the Grace starts flowing more and more within us, then our mental being gets enlightened. When the mental being gets enlightened then you start feeling centres of other persons. Some people you know just get cured. They don’t feel vibrations nothing, just they feel cured. They get cured of cancer, this, that, all sorts of things but they do not get vibrations, they do not get a feeling, they cannot make out whether it is this chakra or that chakra, they do not feel anything.

So the first thing that could happen to anyone is the physical being, the physical being improves. That’s the Grace of God. Because if you are not well, if you have some pains and some problems and some diseases how are you going to pay attention to God and Spirit? That’s very important. But before it comes to the mental self, something else happens also, that, when the Kundalini pierces, the falling of Grace first comes down to the lower centres starting from Nabhi downwards. And Nabhi is a great sucker, Nabhi starts sucking the vibrations or you can say the Grace, and Nabhi starts getting awakened first of all. From Nabhi rises the Swadhishthana which goes round and round, which is connected with Nabhi, so it flows to Swadhishthana and then Swadhishthana also starts working out to self. Swadhishthana sucks in as much as possible and then works out all the centres, I mean all the organs, which are supplied by it.

But Nabhi, when it receives surplus Grace, then it starts opening, and its opening helps us in very gross material life also - you are helped materially. Supposing if you are materially absolutely hopeless, then you are not going to pay attention to God also. So it’s the responsibility of God to first give you a little material well-being. Like I received a letter and also on the tape they have mentioned about somebody who wanted to come to India, from Australia. She got her realisation, she felt very much better, and she wanted to come to India but she had no money to come, and that desire was there. Because of that desire in her she may not have put full attention to her Spirit. And that’s how our material desires get satisfied. And her daughter discovered, she had a bracelet, many bracelets she had and she went to a jumble sale, for selling them for some sort of a programme they had for children. And they discovered that one of the bracelets that she had which she thought to be a junk was of gold, surprisingly, and she sold it for $1500. She was going to sell it for 20c, you see, (laughing) and that was exactly the amount needed for their travel, for both of them.

Now one would say that - how it works out? It is miraculous, that’s all I can say, because the machinery is such, the pouring of the Grace within you informs the Lakshmi Principle in the Nabhi, Nabhi just show them where it is, somebody has to get up and show them, Douglas? Or someone. Douglas (Fry) come here. This is the one and this has the deity of Lakshmi, She is the deity of your well-being. And this is what Krishna has said, “Yoga Kshema vahamyam” When the yoga takes place, means when the Kundalini pierces through fontanelle bone area, I look after your well-being. How does he look after? Through Lakshmi. Now this is a universal deity. She’s present in human beings and also she is present in material things. It is such a fantastic thing that you cannot explain these things on human level, really it is difficult. Only thing you can see for yourself how it works out. It’s so tremendous. Like if you have to explain about human civilisation to an ant it’s going to be difficult. In the same way it’s so difficult you see. And human beings they are so proud of their rationality and I find it impossible how to explain but it does work that way. You can only see the working of it. But if you are proud of your rationality you go ahead with it, what can you do? But you just see for yourself how it works.

So the second layer that really is improved is your material being. So many people have been helped, who are here, materially. The well-being has come. Actual well-being, apart from satisfaction. But as I said, it does not cross the limit, like you do not become Mr. Ford, because that’s some sort of a behaviour which is asahaja, to be so rich, I mean it’s ridiculous, vulgar! You become better than what you are, but not the best because you have to be in the centre at a satisfied point. And everybody has to enjoy you and you have to enjoy everybody. But supposing if you are in dire necessities and problematic things then you cannot pay attention to God and that’s what we understand now, that you cannot.

If you have physical problem, you see, if you have cancer, how can you say that you pay attention to your Spirit when you have cancer? I mean, such a body! After all if this whole house is going to collapse you cannot meditate here. So first the physical stability is established and second the material one. And there are many factors which work out material stability, automatically. First of them is that, once you find your Spirit, you just automatically give up your habits. Most of these habits come from your Nabhi, because from Nabhi you get your seeking. And you think, when you have a habit [that] you are seeking your joy. I mean, many people have said, “Mother, but I enjoy my glass of whiskey,” they have said to me, many a times. Or, “I enjoy a little ride here and there,” some people have said to me that, “Mother, I enjoy some Kensington ladies” you see, sort of thing. But once you start enjoying your Spirit, it drops out. All your attention, you see, becomes enlightened and your priorities change. You don’t enjoy these things that you have been enjoying before so you just don’t do it, I mean, I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t drink!” you just don’t do it. I don’t have to tell you that you don’t smoke, you just don’t do it.

But there are some very weak people, extremely weak, I mean, very, very weak people. They take time, I know, they plod and sort of they are very slow moving creatures, but not all. I would say quite a small number and most of the people, they just give up things. You just give up. So you start saving money, automatically, because the money goes to the races or the pubs or to other habits which are useless, you know they are useless. Smoking, drugs: any such foolish things that you are wasting money on, and you start channelising this money for something better, something that gives you more joy, more happiness and of an eternal nature, not a temporary one that you take the drink previous night and in the morning you are finished! You get a drink which never finishes which you enjoy all the time. You get drunken. Because in my own life I have seen it’s such a so-called sophisticated elite life. People drink much more, you see, than normal people drink. And they ask me, “Why don’t you drink?” I say, “I am already drunk! The day I was born I was so drunk that if I have to drink more I’ll fall off so better not ask me!” They are quite frightened at my, this thing, I said, “I am really fully drunk already” So they start looking at me! And they never find me anyway less in spirit as they are, actually I’m always little more than they are, so they never force me to do that. But these things drop out automatically. I don’t have to tell you that you have to drop out. Because most of the things you have done [are] because you have been seeking something. You know, there are people, I asked them, “Why do you do this?” They said, “We are seeking love,” I said “How? How can you find love like this?” Or somebody will say that, “I am seeking God.” There are many people who are taking drugs, I mean, genuinely, just for seeking. But when they have found it, what they were seeking, they will not take drugs. But this is one of the side issues, I was just trying to make it little lighter.

But mainly what happens is the principle of Lakshmi, the principle of well-being within you is awakened. And if you listen to one of my tapes where I’ve described what a Lakshmi is, and how She is symbolised: it’s a very beautiful picture of Lakshmi, that the great seers have put before us, that, She is after all a Mother, She is a mother. A person who is a rich man has to be a motherly person. But here you find, in the whole world I have seen [that] those who have even little money their nose goes up like that and if you see them from down below they look like wolves, you see, not like mothers, [it’s] most surprising. And this Lakshmi is a Mother who wears a white saree, very elegant, with a gold border. That represents that he doesn’t put people into awe by his pomp and show and this. She’s standing on a lotus. Imagine any human being standing on a lotus! That means that She’s so light in Her behaviour towards others, She’s so delicate, She touches people with such delicacy, that people don’t feel hurt, they are not in any way pressurised by the riches of people. But you know it’s just the opposite, with the so-called rich you feel horrible! If somebody’s coming in here I would like to get out of that way. They try to pressurise because they have money. You see, if somebody starts talking big, you just find out, 99% must have won some horse race! This pressurising is a sign that he is not a lakshmipati, he has nothing to do with Lakshmi. So he’s so gracious. I have seen such people I have seen some people like that. I have seen one in England you may be surprised to know, I have just seen him once. He was a gentleman who was some lord or something and later on he came to India, he was Viceroy (Lord Mountbatten) and there was a gentleman who was very well known to us, he once met him in a train which was delayed or something happened and they had to get down at another station and somehow or other they were put together. And he was so simple and so good and so sensible that this gentleman was taken by him. He said, “Now better you come to my house because there’s not going to be any train you come to my house.” and he went to his house he was surprised the house was like a palace and then he told he who he was and he was amazed. And he even carried his bag, such a simple man. And then when this person told me that such a person is there then he re-visited India, then he brought him to see me. But he’s no more now he’s dead this gentleman (killed by IRA bomb).  But he was a very big man in India and a very big person but such a simple man! Such a simple person.

So that’s the significance of well-being. So when a Sahaja Yogi becomes well-being, gets well-being then he has all these qualities in him that, he doesn’t impress on others that he has a property or he has got money and he should pressurise. If he’s really a good Sahaja Yogi he would be the humblest of all and he would be very generous because in Her hand, one hand is like this. The left hand is like this, means She’s generous, giving. All the time She’s giving. She’s not taking anything, She’s giving. And that’s how such a person is all the time giving.

I have seen people who, after Sahaja Yoga, receive a lot of blessings and are miserly or try to oppress others, lose their properties and lose their money and really suffer a little bit, because otherwise there’s no way of teaching them. So the generosity flows from a hand and another hand is like this which means that She gives protection to people. There have to be some people who are ashritas, are dependents, who just depend, from whom such a person doesn’t take any money, he just lives. These systems are still in India. Those people who are well off always have about two, three people being supported by them. Is a system still working in India, in many places. I mean, in my father’s house we always remember we had people like that. They were educated and given higher education by my father free, just free. But never did they feel that they were anybody else, treated with same respect and with same dignity as we were treated. But that was a part of life, one had to do it. This is the ashraya, is that there should be some people depending on you. England also I’ve seen people have cats, dogs, things like that, you see, little bit they do spend on cats and dogs, but better to spend on human beings. What am I going to do with cats and dogs? Can I give them realisation? (laughter) It’s better to look after human beings than to look after cats and dogs so much, I mean. But I have seen that when they are dealing with cats and dogs they are very happy people, but with human beings they are very unhappy. I don’t know why. If you must have seen in the BBC and all that, when they have these advertisements I’ve seen in television sometimes, you see a person having a cat, she’ll always smile and joke and this. And anybody having children, she looks so miserable! (laughter) That should not be so. There should be somebody dependent.

It’s not important to measure every money, ask for “2p (£0.02) I gave you yesterday, will you return 2p to me?” It’s not, it doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to be like that. If it comes to that, alright, give some money - forget about it. It helps you such a lot, it helps you such a lot. To be meticulously so observant about how much money you lent. It’s better to be more worried about how much you have taken than to be how much you have given. It helps a lot. It’s a thing one has to realise in life, how much it helps you. I have seen in My own life it has helped so many times. I mean you really have people then around you. Matter of 5 Rupees and 10 Rupees is so important then to some people at a [certain] point and it works wonders! I mean, you can have a human worth millions by paying sometimes 5 Rupees, it can work out that way. So try to be more giving and then you’ll receive more as a Sahaja Yogi.  Remember that now you are connected with Lakshmi. The more generous you are the more you get. When you are small minded you do no receive Her blessings. You have to give, you have to give. Once you give, it starts flowing, the stagnation is over and the flow starts coming in. Otherwise you are stagnated when your hand is, you see, tight fisted as you call it. English language has so many good words, though they are now losing their meaning! They call it you are very, I don’t know there must be some new words for being very, very miserly, some good word, you know, which doesn’t mean miserly but must be some ‘economical’ or something fantastic. But actually miserliness is miserliness, give it whatever name you like, it’s horrible. And one should not take to miserliness, that is a curse I tell you, it’s a disease, it’s like leprosy. Try to be generous.

Now the generosity of maybe, I don’t know, but maybe of money, is not difficult for some people, but generosity of saying something good to others is rare. You see somebody in a good dress, you should be generous enough to say, “Oh, it looks fantastic, it’s beautiful.” what’s wrong? But jealousy, that goes against Lakshmi completely. It’s better that others are wearing it you see, you don’t pay for it and you enjoy it! (laughter) It’s very logical you just see it. If you have, you see, if you own this hall, it will be a headache for you isn’t it, to keep it alright. I mean imagine the people who own it, and to put it right because everybody will come and criticise, “This is not good, that’s not good,” but it’s nice to be here, when it doesn’t belong to you, to enjoy. It’s very simple. Just try to be generous with people, be kind to them. And this generosity is lacking. When this starts, then the inner core of emotional being starts settling in you.

Go to the subtler side of material well-being and you start getting into emotional well-being. Small, small things work out, very small. It’s very sweet. We have so many examples of this little sweetness. And this generosity should come to all the Sahaja Yogis, of saying good things to others. Doesn’t matter [that] it is exaggeration, doesn’t matter, because it acts as a buffer, you see. Then the fright of the strangers, fright of the neighbours, fright of other human beings, you know. Every human being has become, he sees another human being, he recoils back. Imagine! First, I mean, say about 50 years back it was like dogs; if any human being saw another human being they used to bark! Now it is another way round. So, the fear of your brother, of your own kith and kin, of your part and parcel. They are your own, you don’t know, they are part and parcel of your being, you can feel it, after Sahaja Yoga you can feel it, I don’t have to tell you. You can feel them within yourself, they are within you. And then the sweetness of saying something sweet, of saying something sweet is so nice, is so rewarding. Itself, itself is so rewarding.

The movement of Shakti is always this way. If I give you love, love comes back to me, if I give you hatred, hatred comes back to me, and double fold everything. If I give you love, say 1 unit, I may get 7 units of love [returned], but if I give you hatred of 1, that too, 7 units of hatred comes to you. The mathematics is complete. So try to understand that, emotionally, you have to understand your material well-being. How to express emotionally your material well-being is a very sweet thing. I would give you an example of Gavin because I can’t forget that very sweet incident: One day we had called some people, you see, I didn’t know there would be so many coming, in his house. And he has a house but, I mean, not so big like this. So there were about fifty people, around. And I told him prepare some food for all of them, but I thought for fifty people he could not have prepared, at the most for ten people you see, so I was quite embarrassed  and I was waiting for people to go away, I didn’t insist to stay on for dinner or anything, I thought, “Poor Gavin, how could he have cooked for fifty people” you see. And when they disappeared, you see, about five, six were remained I said, “Now let’s have dinner”. He was very unhappy and he was looking this side and that side, I said, “What happened?” but he didn’t say anything. So I slept that night in his house, next morning I got up, still he was very angry. Next day I said, “What’s the matter? What’s playing on your mind?” He said, “Mother why did you ask all of them to go away? I had prepared [dinner] for fifty of them?” you see.  This filled me with such joy you can’t imagine, tremendous joy, tremendous joy. I mean that I cannot get over such things you know.

And I have just seen so many Sahaja Yogis like that, very very much. Another is Gregoire, another very sweet person the way he does things for others, you know. Sometimes the way he works it out is so sweet, and how he really knows how to express himself sweetly in small ways. It’s surprising, how people are very beautiful and how they are working out these material things to express their emotional being. Material is for emotions only, you see. My mother had a principal that, if she had six sarees, the seventh one she’ll present out.  She had kept six. Not more [are] needed, you see. And she was a woman of great principle I must say because she used to spin her own sarees. Can you imagine! And that’s what she used to wear, herself. And she was the wife of a very rich man, I mean, she had no problem of money but this was her principle, she used to live like that. And she said that, “What? I need six, more than [that] I don’t need,” because it’s cotton sarees, you see, so one saree you wash and next you wear and you can just press (iron) it. We had people in the house who could do that for her. She said, “There’s no need to have more than six.”  And one she would keep for some occasion, you see, expensive one, if she has to go for a wedding and all that, that’s all. So the seventh was kept (to give away) and out of the six, if she got one more she would donate that to somebody. She would only keep up to six you see.  That was her principle and she managed her life very well and I was also bit too much of a generous person and she always supported my generosity. Always she supported it. And she was very happy when she found that  I would just give away lots of things to people who came to my house and she was that way. Everybody used to say that, “That should be done”. Always used to encourage me for such things that I did.

But I found [that] all things have only value if I can give them away otherwise they have no value. And I keep only the things that are being presented to me all the rest pass out of my hands very easily into people. Anybody who says, “I like this,” “Alright, have it!” You see, I feel so happy to give it to them and it’s really rewarding. Now that person thinks, “What should I give you back?” I said, “Now please! That’s not to be done because you know already, come and see, this house is filled with things, and I don’t know how to get rid of it.”

If I buy anything myself, of course I don’t earn anything so it’s from my husband’s money, I try to give them . It’s very nice. It’s really extremely nice, after all what’s the use of these things in the house? What are you going to do [with them]? I mean, if you have got to have a personal archives, you can have! Or something like that, putting up pictures which you got there or got there. But normally what do you do? So this kind of a generosity is to be developed within us.

The aesthetics of generosity is to be seen. How you give things to others and how you express your emotional thing. For people who are emotionally dry because of ego orientation, should learn these things, is very important. That will give them some emotional side. [It’s] very much necessary for people who do not feel their feelings much, their joy much; they should try to do, they will start feeling it much more. Then the emotional side is enlightened within us, the grace starts flowing up to emotional side. In emotional side, first of all the purification takes place. That’s very important.

To lead a very beautiful emotional life you must have pure ideals, otherwise you can never be emotionally alright. You see,  like in a tree you have to have leaves you have to have fruits, you have to have fruits, you have to have flowers at it’s proper places. Like in your house you have to have a drawing room, you have to have a bedroom, you have to have a bathroom; everything separated. You do not put them into a complete, what do you call a…what do you call that? A mixer. You do not make it like that, isn’t it? You don’t put your bathroom in the drawing room do you?  I mean some people may start it with the kind of confusion they have these days! But normally you didn’t. In our own emotional life we must have pure sense. Purity of a sisterly love, purity of a brotherly love, purity of a wife’s love. For example infidelity, infidelity is impurity, infidelity comes when there is impurity. Without fidelity the marriage life cannot be happy. That’s the basis of married life. You see, “I like…”  this “I like” business is impurity. The impurity in you likes it. Gradually, after realisation, you start developing that purity within you, you start understanding these are your brothers and sisters. As soon as your emotional life starts improving, your innocence starts awakening. You see? It is connected with your innocence, the left side is connected with your innocence. And then it starts flowering, you really become innocent.

Now see the practical side of it. You go to somebody’s house, the gentleman has a beautiful wife, while you have your bad eyes on the wife, how can you enjoy? You cannot enjoy, the husband cannot enjoy, the wife cannot enjoy, all the time there’s a fear. Maybe the wife may run away with you or something may happen: the whole house will be finished, I mean, you are so destructive! So-called ‘charming’ men and ‘charming’ women are just destroying each others lives. What do they do to the love? All in the orphanages! A woman marries seven times, a husband marries eight times. All these old people are in the orphanage (old peoples home) and children are in another orphanage. You see, you are just creating orphanages by this kind of impurity in your being. But by telling you, these things, you are not going to believe me, nor you can do it, but just when it happens. When this happens, the innocence, the joy of pure love, where there is no other impurity but just pure love of brothers, sisters. I mean, here, I have seen people don’t even sort of embrace each other - men. It’s most surprising, I mean, for us it’s something one can’t understand, you see.

So much impurity has gone into our brain that every man, you see is that is he that way gone? When we came here my husband used to embrace every man. I told him, “Don’t do it, people will laugh at you!” He said, “Really?” He said, “But everyone is not like that, maybe one person.” I said, “No, they think everybody is like that.” You see, whatever they found pathological in one person, they think everybody is like that. These psychologists, whatever they read in one abnormal person, they try to see in everyone! Everybody is not like that! I mean there is no harm in understanding that there is only 1% people are psychologically like that, who go to these psychologists! The other’s who are spoilt are because of psychologists themselves! They put ideas, “You have a guilt, you have a guilt, you have a guilt.” Even if you don’t have, you will have it! (laughter) They go on putting ideas into your heads. All this is supposed to be intellectual expansion, whatever you may call it, it’s all nonsense you see. A person who doesn’t commit sin you say, “Now you must have committed sin,” now he doesn’t know what to do he says, “Alright baba, I have committed sin, now I have to confess. So I have to confess, yes I have committed sin.” They play about like this. They just try to build you up and all that and then they break you, shatter you completely and then you think, “Oh I am the most sinful person [who] ever lived!” If you were that sinful, do you think you would have got realisation, first of all? First ask yourself the question, “How did I get realisation? How did I feel vibrations? If I was that sinful, how could I get?” Throw away all these ideas of these psychologists and tell them that we don’t believe!

You see, this is very few people who are really basically sinful, I tell you, very, very rarely. I have not seen anyone so much. Except for these horrible gurus who are well known! After all they are the people who are rakshasas, they are not human beings, you see, so that’s a different category. But, otherwise, I have not seen basically a person who has nothing good in him because everybody has the Spirit. And definitely Spirit is superior much more dynamic than all the sins put together. What are these little, little sins here and there? What are you doing? And there’s nothing to feel so diffident about it. After all you are realised people, you are saints. You are to be respected. You have to respect yourself first of all. You are all saints, do you realise that?

Once you realise you are saints you start acting like saints, how the saints act. You will put yourself onto that pedestal of understanding that you are really saints, otherwise you won’t get vibrations. Go and ask anyone of these! They will tell you that the vibrations, only people who are saints get it. In India all the people are burnt when they die [but] not the [realised] souls, realised souls are not. They are respected. They say when the saints come to your house, that’s the day, is the day of festival. And all of you are that so don’t think that you cannot do this, and you have this guilt and you have these things - nothing of the kind! You are pure Spirit. Be very lavish about it! Of course, I mean, too much indulgences into these things, emotional life also, can lead you to (?). Like I hear people saying that, “There’s a lot of love between us.” But one has to be discreet in that also: does it make you universal or it makes you localised? You see, like Britishers for British, Indians for Indians, finished! If that love makes you universal, by which you say kindly things, by which you enjoy the love of other people, their vibrations. Whatever creed, race, it is, whatever part of the world they come from, they are Sahaja Yogis. If you start enjoying them, then know that that is love. It should not be localised, no! If there is any group forming, then must know that it is not love, it’s not divinity, it’s not. Divinity is universal, it embraces everything, everything, it has no discrimination of any kind. It only discriminates between evil and good, unrighteous and righteous, Christ and anti-Christ, God and …(break in recording)

..the approach or mental development or emotional expressions. Some people are emotionally very expressive. I would say English are less expressive by temperament maybe, that’s their temperament. Indians are extremely expressive. If you go to India, to a village, say, you go to Rahuri (Maharashtra), they will just take you in their embrace and would start weeping and crying at you. You will be amazed the way they will love you, I mean, imagine! And for them it would be like, they wouldn’t mind even if they have to, sort of, spread themselves on the ground for you to walk smoothly so that you don’t feel the horrible roads of India. That kind of tremendous emotional expression you will be surprised. You will be overwhelmed and sometimes shocked, you know, the way they are. But that doesn’t mean that English don’t love. They love very well also. They understand them. So that’s how it should be that it is all embracing, all shades, all types, all permutations, combinations. Because this variety is created by God to create beauty and all the varieties must be accepted. Imagine you all looking just the same! How would it look? Horrible and boring! Every leaf is different, then what about human beings? But in that difference there’s a unity of Spirit and if you can feel that unity then you are emotionally absolutely correct and you are a realised soul.

And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit, Spirit that resides in your heart. All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit, otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy. Spirit is the one which is the dynamic, which shines on this beautiful ring of your body, your mind and your emotions. That’s the most important state. That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being. That state should be achieved by all of you but the growth, if the outside is not alright then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside. It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing. It’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful. Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely. I mean, I have to control myself. The love just shoots out of the being and just I want to give it, but I wonder whether you’ll be able to bear it, so I have to control it a little bit, that flood may not be there.

So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty; and the more you enrich it, the more you make it strong, the more it will shine. Because one must understand that Spirit is God, his all attention, his all awareness. And it knows your problem it slowly says, “Let’s see how far you can bear? How far you can go?” Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside, the inside starts shining by itself.  But attention should be towards your Spirit. All the outside qualities are so joy-giving to the Spirit, you can’t imagine. Try it! You will enjoy yourself. We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much, if we could we would not [even] shun the jails, I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you because I can enjoy myself there better! But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself much when you cannot share it with others also very much. It becomes like that. Without sharing with others also very much. It becomes like that: without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself. And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis. At that level you should go. You should be at that level. Try to keep your level that high, is important. Sometimes you come down, you start criticising others. Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees somebody who’s filthy, dirty, something. The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt. But that person should be treated. At least he should be clean. I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum. But instead of that if you start criticising that person, you also become filthy in your language, filthy in your mind, I mean, so why? Leave it! Let that person improve by himself, to see that he has to be clean, he has to be good, he has to be sensible. This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you. Where is your attention? It’s a habit in India, all the parents will ask the children when they are there, “Where is your attention?” You see “Where is my attention?” alright. Then again you are standing there, “Where is your attention?” again you have to be on the watch [out], “Where is my attention?” We have to look after our attention, that’s what, “Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

Next time I’ll tell you more about the Spirit, very much. I hope you have understood how necessary it is to develop your inner being. In your mental being, egoistical nature is to be controlled very much.

I have seen people who go from left to right, they become a bhoot, those who go from right to left, they become like that. All these side movements must be brought to the centre. You have to understand that from basics you have to rise higher. People have explanation for everything. No explanation is needed. Whom are you explaining? You are explaining to yourself, you are judging yourself. You have to judge yourself, [to] whom are you explaining? Mataji? She doesn’t need any explanation, I know, perhaps, everything, perhaps. But I don’t condemn you and in any way I do not want that you should be condemned by any chance at all. Why should I? You are all saints after all. For me it’s the greatest satisfaction. But for your own growth I want you to understand that you are saints and you have to come up to that level. Saints have to be self-disciplined, nobody has to tell them. Discipline yourself, tell yourself and face it. What an opportunity! What an opportunity!  And people are only going to believe in you when you are really a saint within and saint without. In Sahaja Yoga, people become saints within and not saints without easily. But in other systems they are first made outside, you see, they are made to work for 25 years just washing the temple - finished! Then they are made to do something else for 25 years. By the time they are about to [be] dead they’ll say, “Alright, next year I promise, next time we’ll give you realisation.”  It’s like that. But here, from inside you really receive your realisation no doubt, and you have greater chances of improving. This is what I thought, that, this lifetime I am just going to give realisation to all the people who come to me this time. And you are going to do full justice to my (?) because now you’ve got it. It is going to work out much faster. It has to work out. Because the only way it could have worked out faster would be to make you first of all wash yourself every day, get up at 4 o’clock and make you (unclear) .

Then the self-discipline has started. And must try to improve your life. If you could just ? to make it a beautiful life, clean life and generous giving light, the light of God. It will work out I am sure.

Keep your standards high. Do not fall down. Put your attention into proper care. It’s all prophesised as you know, Blake has prophesised it. The more I read the book the more I am convinced that England is going to be the Jerusalem. Now think of that. No lethargy allowed. While I find Australians are coming up much faster. You have to fulfil Blake’s prophesies.

May God bless you. All of you.
