Grand Vena Recital Chitti Babu, 27-01-1986

Actually, the music is divine and you feel you are in paradise, the way it was rendered.

The Adivadaya is played before you. I have no words to describe My joy. I'm only sorry that people have no sense of understanding this great music that is in our country. If they listen to this music, they'll have no diseases, no heart attacks, nothing. This is absolutely divine and people should take to it in such a way that it's a blessing of God that we have such great artists in our country existing. My heart binds to see such great artists not being properly recognized, appreciated and worshipped. I'm sure one day they will come and they will go all over the world and play this beautiful praise of Saraswati. You must know that the only way we can keep healthy is through our music, our talas, our dancing. This is the blessing of our ancient gurus and we should not try to go to these Adogati people of the West and spoil ourselves. On the contrary, they will appreciate it thousand times more than we can appreciate.

May God bless them all and bless you all that you are appreciating. It's tremendous. I have no words to express. The greatest joy I have felt today with this beautiful music rendering.

May God bless you all.
