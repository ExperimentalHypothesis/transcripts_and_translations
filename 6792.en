Radio Interview
October 8th, 1982
Wellington, UK

Reporter: This is Phil Malone for the County Show at the Victoria Centre in Park Road in Wellingborough. With me is Mataji, who teaches Sahaja Yoga. Now, Mataji, what exactly does this yoga involve?
Shri Mataji: Sahaja means: “saha” means with, “ja” is born. So whatever is born with you means spontaneous. It is a living process of the living force, which is surrounding us, which is everywhere, which pulsates in everything. And this happening is the breakthrough, the ultimate breakthrough into our unconscious; can be described psychologically.
Reporter: So some people call this self-realization.
Shri Mataji: Same.
Reporter: Now, Your background is from a Christian family in India. 
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Reporter: Is Your teaching involved with Christianity or not?
Shri Mataji: It is, of course, because Christ is very important for Sahaja Yoga, no doubt. But the way we understand Christ out of the text of Bible is very limited. We have to see to other texts about Him, and expand, and explain Him, what He meant, because Bible is not sufficient to explain Him.
Reporter: So, is Your message one of peace and that’s, in that case, peace in the rest of the world or peace within people?
Shri Mataji: Absolutely. Peace within will only bring the peace outside. Whatever we are inside is expressed outside.
Reporter: Now, You have had some successes in curing people or healing people in the past. Is this because You work from the inside out or how do You do it?
Shri Mataji: It’s just very simple because you have the vitality, that Force is vitality itself. And once you have that flowing through you, if you give that vitality to someone, that person is revitalized. In simple words you can say like that. But actually it is a happening within you which takes place. There is a residual force, the germinating force you can call it, or the ascending force within you, which rises and gives you the experience of your Spirit. Means your Spirit comes into your attention, means you can feel it on your central nervous system. So you receive the information or, we can say, you become enlightened by the Spirit, which is the Absolute. Once you receive the Absolute, as a by-product of that all these things drop out, all your maladjustments and everything.
Reporter: Now, tonight You’re appearing in Northampton at the Guildhall.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Reporter: If people went along, what would You have to say to them tonight?
Shri Mataji: I’ll have to explain to them what actually they are. Actually they are the Spirit, and this body, mind and all these things are just the covering. Now our attention is at our body level, at the level of our mind, or emotions. But you have to go beyond, and with this happening it happens. When it happens, you become the twice-born, as they call it, like an egg becoming a bird the transformation takes place.
Reporter: So this second birth coming, some people perhaps they believe this would happen when they die.
Shri Mataji: It’s not possible. How can that be? That’s a misunderstanding. There are lots of misunderstandings we have about these things, which can be removed. First logically we have to reach certain conclusions, logically. So that we don’t put our brain a complete stop, we see through our logical understanding that what we have to achieve, if it’s a living force. Then we achieve it. Once we achieve it, then we have to verify it if it is so or not. It’s all absolutely open.
Reporter: So, are Your followers then... how do they practice this form of yoga? I mean, do they do it in conjunction with other religions, for example?
Shri Mataji: You see, these religions that you see, outside they look like different religions but actually they are one. All these are flowers out of one tree of life. They are different flowers to look at, but they are not. They are living on the same truth, there’s no difference at all between them. But when you pluck them and call them “this is mine, this is mine,” they become dead, ugly, and funny. That’s how fanaticism has come. All religions are born out of truth and here you find the integration of them, complete integration.
Reporter: Well, You’ll be meeting with people from Northampton and from the rest of the county in the Guildhall tonight and thank You very much for speaking with us.
Shri Mataji: The address is: Guildhall, St. Giles’ Square, Northampton.
Reporter: And it starts at about half past seven.
Shri Mataji: Yes, half past seven it will start. I hope to see-
Reporter: Thank You very much. This is Phil Malone for the County Show at the Victoria Centre, Palk Road, in Wellingborough.
Shri Mataji: Was that good?
Reporter: That’s great, that’s fine, yes, thanks very much. ...take these flowers with You, all right.
Shri Mataji: You should have asked about gurus, I think that’s important.
Reporter: [unclear].
Shri Mataji: That’s very important, you know, because all the people are misled by gurus and all this hypnotic stuff, and black magic. You must save all these people. That’s very important. R: Yes, they get confused, do they?
Shri Mataji: Very much confused, you see, the confusion is so much. That’s the sign of modern times also. You must know what to expect.
Reporter: Mm, yes. Anyway all the best, Thanks very much indeed.
Reporter: Thank You, OK, [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.
Reporter: OK, Thank You, [UNCLEAR].
Shri Mataji: Sorry I was late, but yesterday was such a funny experience. We came down running out forty miles, and nothing happened. Thank you very much, thank you. Good-bye.
