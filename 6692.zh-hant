你是神聖存有的一部分

1980年12月1日 英國倫敦卡克斯頓大廳

我的房子容納不下你們所有人,因此我想最好來這兒,這裡適合所有人。今天是留給我們霎哈嘉瑜伽士的最後一天(母親去印度的旅程前)。

我們必須瞭解關於我們自己和我們組織的一些非常非常重要的事情,那就是神聖。

現在,我可以告訴你們,從整體上,而不是從個體的問題或事情上,因為你們現在不再是個體。你們都變成了神聖存有的一部分,你們都是覺醒的細胞,因此在整體的層面上,我們必須理解為此我們要做些什麼。

首要的,我們必須要知道我們是得自覺的靈,你們得到了自覺,你們是聖人,你們擁有聖人所能具有的所有力量。沒有一位聖人比你們擁有更多的力量,事實上,這一切正在顯現之中。沒有聖人擁有你們今天所擁有的知識。

你們將會感到驚訝:迄今為止沒有一本書能講述你們內在的靈性存有,通過霎哈嘉瑜伽,你們才開始認識這個部分。你們必須接受這個事實,事實就是如此。那些聖人中的任何一位,不管誰寫了多少書——即使是商揭羅,他也不能解釋像你們所知道的這麼多的事情。然而商揭羅的素質是極高的——或者說他這類型的人,如摩根迪亞,或者佛陀。他們的素質是極高的,因為他們是極之純潔的人們——純淨。他們在非常高的程度上得到了個人救贖。然而你們更好地達到了集體的救贖。但就個體來講,他們的素質極高。他們對神聖的力量沒有疑惑,他們對神毫無疑惑。他們從沒有任何疑惑,他們非常尊貴。他們從不為生活的瑣事而煩惱。對他們而言,去思考這些事情太微不足道了。任何瑣碎之事,我們在上面花費太多時間。我知道我們得處理它,因為畢竟我們是人類,我們帶著人類的意識來到了霎哈嘉瑜伽,然後我們得到了自覺。因此,你們淨化的時間非常非常短暫。而他們有如此多的時間來淨化自己。

現在,舉個例子,摩西是降世神祇,具有非常純淨的品格,或者,耶穌是降世神祇,絕對純淨的化身。但是祂們是我們的典範,而我們要做的是從人類變成先知。

因此你們對這兩方面(靈性&人性)都很瞭解,人類的弱點是什麼,他們有什麼問題,他們如何逃離實相,他們如何受到迷惑。但是,我們仍然沒有好好使用我們應該使用的生命能量的力量。這點就是我想告訴你們的——你們都有生命能量的力量。當我們開始使用生命能量的力量時,我們也不知道,為了應用這力量,我們應該抱有什麼樣的尊嚴和禮儀。這是我們內在神祇的力量,這是一種儀式,通過它,我們讓神祇的力量在我們內在運作。

就如你們所知道的,古時候的人們通過這種力量創造了許多奇跡,但是他們是非常有尊嚴的人,他們的性格中沒有輕浮,他們的內在沒有無用的,或完全沒有靈性價值的問題存在。當你使用你的生命能量的覺知時,你不應該將它們用在無用的事上,比如,去電影院有交通堵塞,然後你覺得這有交通問題,所以你必須用你生命能量的力量來到達那地方。這是輕佻的,它根本不重要。在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,你是否去到電影院無關緊要。緊要的是:什麼是你靈性的力量,你在你的靈性上走了多遠。電影院一點也不重要。你是聖人,你內在所能達到的聖潔程度才是主要的問題。否則,你其他的所有事情都是沒意義的。或者說所有這些問題在靈性中都是毫無意義的。

因此,所有的霎哈嘉瑜伽士必須認識到,你們現在是新生兒,你們有新的覺知,你們必須擁有那種尊嚴。

我舉個例子,因為今天我剛好在跟人討論這個。當你給某人班丹時,你只是像這樣或那樣轉動你的手,不應該這樣做。你們的手本身就要受到尊重,因為這是一位聖人的手。所有的神祇都居住在你的手上和手指上,因此,當你必須給班丹或任何事時,你必須恰當地使用手和手指,以一種有尊嚴的方式去使用它們。應該絕對避免任何侮辱或低俗的行為方式。

然後關於對待彼此,你們必須知道:你們現在都在神聖力量的流通中。你們必須互相尊重,相親相愛。你們必須互相尊重,因為你們都是聖人。每位聖人都必須尊重其他聖人,這是最低限度。如果你們不互相尊重,你們的輪穴將會失調,尤其是喉輪,因為這是集體的聯繫。同樣母親的輪穴也會失調,因為你們的安全感就是你們的集體性。彼此之間的愛不僅要得到照顧,而且要得到滋養,受到崇拜,這應該是一種美德。你們對待彼此不應該像普通人一樣。不要!這是一種很珍貴的關係。即使在對任何一位非常親密的人談話時——比如你兄弟,姐妹,丈夫,妻子——你都必須要尊重,你必須要尊重,要不然,就毫無意義。

當你們的父母成為霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你們必須比以前更加尊重他們,因為他們是聖人,也是你們的父母。首先,相互尊重是彼此關係的基調。沒有愛意的尊重則沒有意義。彼此尊重,還要相親相愛。一個人在生活中地位高低,在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,都無關緊要。你們掙了多少錢,你們在生活中地位如何,你們住在哪兒都不重要。重要的是我們是一體的,我們是那些已成為先知的人,我們是那些得到力量能夠提升他人昆達裡尼的人,這樣的一種力量進入我們,是因為我們的母親非常愛我們,因此我們的義務是彼此相愛。

我是如何尊重你的?其實我不需要如此,因為你知道在你我之間有一個巨大的鴻溝。但是我仍然尊重你們,因為你是聖人。任何聖人不受尊重的地方,那個國家就會墮落。

因此,首先你們必須學會如何互相尊重。這是我們應該進行的非常非常重要的訓練。不管他是你的丈夫還是妻子,不管他是你的兄弟還是姐妹,父親,母親,或者孩子,因為他是一位聖人——請尊重他!

但我不知道你們會對此如何反應,馬上地,你開始想及那些不尊重你的人。想到有多少人你沒有尊重。這是典型的自我導向的反應,我們馬上開始思考,“噢,那個人不尊重我了!那個男的不尊重我!”但只是想想有多少人你沒有尊重。

當我不在這兒時,其實我在這兒的時間更多。我還沒去過澳大利亞,但你們知道那裡的人有多了不起——那麼純潔,那麼善良,那麼出色。但是這裡,這種情況並不多見,因此我必須在這裡工作,真的很辛苦。這並不是說英國有那麼糟糕。但是一直有種感受,“母親在這裡,我們將把我們所有的問題留給她,然後她能夠解決。”你們帶給我多是雞毛蒜皮的事——這無所謂——但是現在你們有能力去解決你們的問題,也有能力去解決他人的問題。

除非是一些根本的事,否則你們沒必要麻煩我,也不需要問我。你們可以去做。但是你們必須從霎哈嘉瑜伽的角度來思考每樣事——你們為霎哈嘉瑜伽做了多少?你們為霎哈嘉瑜伽成就了多少?這才是如今的霎哈嘉瑜伽士聚在一起(所要做的事情)。

我們必須要從根本上理解一件事:那就是我們必須要成長,我們得讓別人和我們一起成長。他人的成長並非通過抑制我們的成長來實現,而是與我們共同成長。

只有當你讓其他人與你一起成長時,你才會成長。否則,就不會真正地成長。現在,不管我說什麼,都會寫進書裡,有時候能進入人們的腦子裡——它應進入人們的心裡

整個霎哈嘉瑜伽系統都是在心靈的層面上工作:那裡即是靈。靈才是我所談論的。靈由此而感到喜樂。

我聽說,有一些人像使用武器一樣使用他們的雙手。這是非常危險的。你們不應為了你自己而做這一切。你們只是聖人,還不是神。所以不要嘗試這類事情。有一些人有像這樣用手打人的習慣。當我在場,要你這樣做的時候,是沒問題的。但除此之外,你不應該這樣做。

你必須要(學會)尊重。使用所有溫柔溫和的方法,不要對聖人做任何不敬之事。當然,我知道你在打擊另外一個人身上的負面能量。但是你沒必要那樣做(打人),或去拋棄任何人,或排擠某人做某事。你會下降得非常厲害。這是一件你們必須要明白的,非常嚴肅的事情。你擁有所有的力量,知道自己能去到多遠,因此你必須要保持份際。不要越界,因為這類事情給你自我,而自我是我們一直面對的非常危險的東西。盡力去改善你的語言表達,儘量和善,彼此要非常和善。

我希望下次再來的時候你們會有更多的人。我對你們寄予厚望。我不知道是否應當如此,但我給予你們的東西如此美妙、如此宏大,這是令人難以置信的。無疑,我希望你們能做到,因為你們是被特別揀選的。我與你們一起工作了許多年。你們有英語錄音帶。法國人,可憐的傢伙,他們沒有法語錄音帶,錄音帶必須被翻譯。他們沒有法語的書,他們很難理解我(所說過的話)。然而他們是多麼專注、多麼深入。他們每一個人都說,“母親,我是如此愛您,我愛您。”“我有很多缺點,但我把自己奉獻給您,您能接受我嗎?”他們所有人都這樣說。只是想像一下!我很驚訝他們對我說這些事情的方式,以及他們理解自己內在缺陷的方式。

現在,我們必須改變我們對待金錢、物質、情感、身體和所有這些事情的行為方式。比如說,一個人結婚了——婚姻應當是成功的。如果你的婚姻不成功,也不幸福,你就不會受到祝福,一點都不會。嘗試讓你的婚姻非常幸福和成功。這是非常重要的。婚姻是由太初之母所建立的體制。你們不能令它蒙羞。不要草率地對待你們的婚姻。

然後你們必須允許孩子出生,這樣你們便能使偉大的靈降生在這地球上,如此我們給予他們一個機會,一個非常好的機會,來過非常幸福的生活。但是,如果夫妻之間不開心,那麼即使自覺的靈出生了,他們也會給你們添麻煩,他們不能很好地成長,他們會有問題。

因此,首要的,(你們要)創造一個幸福喜樂的家庭。有些人認為,如果他們遠離霎哈嘉瑜伽士,他們將會過上幸福美滿的婚姻生活。這是絕對錯誤的,完全錯誤。如果你不能在靈舍中創造一個美滿的婚姻生活,你在任何其他地方也都不能。首先在靈舍中嘗試,值得一試。否則,你們不能成就它。因為這樣你就會明白如何與他人分享你的生活和你的婚姻生活。

任何物質上的東西,比如買了一個房子或買了這個東西、那個東西,都不那麼重要。你內在的房屋、你心的聖殿應該是潔淨的。我們在這世上不是為了建造房屋,不是為了掙錢攢錢。我們在此是要建立內在的聖殿,生生不息的真正的聖殿,它充滿生機,是我們內在的活生生的神所安住之處。因此,這些物質性的東西在一定程度上是重要的,但不要超過那個度。最重要的,不是你如何得到霎哈嘉瑜伽的驗證,而是霎哈嘉瑜伽通過你得到了多少證明。

很多人認為,“我們應該得到一個好房子,因為我們來到了瑪塔吉這裡了。”是的,你確實得到了。你得到了好工作。沒錯。你得到了它。你的財政狀況得到了改善。沒錯。每件事情都在你身上發生了。但是你給了霎哈嘉瑜伽多少?以這樣的方式,對於霎哈嘉瑜伽你證實了多少?

人們有時候認為,如果他們捐款就足夠了——這不夠。用你的心、你的愛、你的友誼、你們彼此間甜蜜的理解、以最純潔的形式享受彼此間的陪伴來豐富它,不帶有任何目的,不像某個自我傾向或性傾向的人得到的那些低級的享樂或者低級的快樂。而是純潔的喜樂,純粹的喜樂。純潔是我們必須要面對的主題。我們必須試著更純潔一些、更純潔一些。然後那純潔會燦爛地閃耀在你們的臉上、體現在你們的行為中、彰顯在你們將成為的整體存有中。

你的存在本身就會顯示出你是一名霎哈嘉瑜伽士。你不需要去證明。你不需要去穿著某些特別的衣著來表現,但是人們會從你的臉上和行為中就知道你是聖人。你得站在隊伍的最後。你應該是那種旁觀事情的人:你不應該去爭第一個,也不需要搶先排到隊伍最前面,不!你是在最後的,因為你與你自己在一起。他們不是,他們沒有得到自己的安全感,所以嘗試在這些事物中尋找它。而你們有自己的安全感。

基於靈,來改變你們所有的優先次序,然後喜樂就變成你們自己的了。我真的期待你們能做出美妙的事情來,我希望你們都能一起努力,創造出美妙的東西。我不知道如何來單獨講述這些事情,但事實上,我已經在巴黎和這些霎哈嘉瑜伽士講過了,我告訴他們,霎哈嘉瑜伽會有非常迅速的發展,而且極為迅速。這麼快的迅速以至於如果你跟不上霎哈嘉瑜伽的速度,那麼你將會被拋棄。你必須保持霎哈嘉瑜伽的速度。那些不能通過某種方式來保持此速度的,或那些被某些事情或某些錯誤的認同所禁錮的人,將會掉隊。

只有保持與霎哈嘉瑜伽的速度同步,你們才能夠成長。霎哈嘉瑜在印度的發展將會是非常驚人的。我知道這五年在澳大利亞,也將會是極好的。英國的話也有可能,這取決於你們這些人的速度。霎哈嘉瑜伽將會飛速前進,你們必須理解——要放下你們所有的枷鎖,放下所有錯誤的認同,所有荒謬的狂熱或所有諸如你是英國人,這啊那的一些錯誤的認同。只是成為霎哈嘉瑜伽士,成為宇宙的存有。這是非常重要的。時代已經來臨。明年將要開始。

我祝福你們新年快樂,有一個非常非常幸福和愉悅的耶誕節!

願神祝福你們!

Now we have to await for other people who will be coming now but [if] any Sahaja Yogis have any problems or any questions should ask now till other programme will start.

Can you have some chair nearby to talk to them? I think a simple one will do, it’s too elaborate to more. Douglas wants to move the whole big thing? Just an ordinary chair, Douglas, is alright for me.

He wants to move the big one.

Ask me questions, very important, on to small, small things. Later on, “Mother said so,” or, “Mother said so,” should not be there. Sahaja Yogis should ask because new people who have come, who have not got yet Realisation should wait for a while because I am just dealing with the Sahaja Yogis. And then we'll start our programme  after just, say, ten minutes. Is it all right for new people?

Just put it (the chair) here.

Douglas Fry: Should we bring it further forward?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. I am alright. Just bring it nearer here.

Now, I want Sahaja Yogis to ask me questions. It is important. Sahaja yogis should ask me questions. Please. You have to do everything with consultation with each other. No group should be formed separately.

Ask me questions. Come along! What's the matter?

Don. You’re getting thoughtless. Then, “Mother said like this,” and “Mother says like this,” and “Mother has told..” - this should be stopped. You see, actually we think outside going, outside doing is the way. No! Inside! Grow inside.

Certain things I am going to write it down so that there's no confusion about things but, till I come back, the ashram system should go as it is today. Then when I come back we'll change it. But just now it's all right as it is. Nobody should take new steps. If you get a house or something, all right, you take a house. But better thing is to stick on to ashram for the time being, look after it and substantiate. I mean [if] somebody is allotting you a house, it’s all right. But you need not take a house on rent or something to get out of ashram. That's the escape.

Ray Harris: I often find that it’s better to - after telling them the basics of Sahaja Yoga - to wait for them to tell you. And in what they say and their vibrations, what is it that they want to know, rather than really telling them everything.

Shri Mataji: No, no. You should be very discreet. As I have told you in one of My lectures that there are three groups of Sahaja Yogis. One are the people who are in the inner circle. Most of you are here. You need not tell them many things. Everything need not be told. That is being not dishonest but that you are discreet. I mean, you need not tell everything. That's a wrong thing. Discretion is to be used. Then the second type are the people who are Sahaja Yogis but yet not there. Still [who] are doubting and still are not so developed. Their Kundalini is not up there. They are still [a] funny type. These are the people you have to be careful about. You need not tell them everything because they can't bear the Truth. They are not yet ready. Unless and until the Kundalini has reached a certain stage they cannot bear it. The sooner you start doing that, the worse they will become. Their doubts will be more because this is too much for them to bear. So you have to wait, wait and see for yourself. That should not be done. Just talk about Sahaja Yoga, direct. You need not talk about me. Now how will they understand me? I mean, you cannot understand me, how can they understand?

The other day somebody asked me that, “Kundalini rises with such difficulties, and they had to purify yourself and all that, and here how my Kundalini has risen like this. Mother? How could it be?” I said, “It has risen or not?” He said, “Yes.” “You feel it?” “Yes, yes, I have. It is risen.” Then I said, “There must be something with me. All right?” He said, “That's what I was wondering that must be something about Mother. How is it that She's done it?” I said, "There is something. All right. So just now you need not find out. Just now you find out about yourself. Let it grow. Because I do not want to shock you. There is something about me, no doubt.”

And one of them was saying that, “It's such a miraculous thing that my sinus has gone, I am feeling so much better. My drugs I have given up. I'm so much better and so fantastic that I can't believe it. How can it be? I tried all kinds of medicines, I went to the hospital, I did this, I did that, I had an operation. Nothing worked out. And how is it this simple thing like Sahaja Yoga has worked out?” I said, “It is too simple but it is to the point. It's so precise. It acts. It is something that acts.” “But how is it?” I said, “It does!” Like we were going to Paris. They announced that the temperature of Paris is zero degrees. So, Christine was sitting next to me rather worried. I said, “Don't you worry! It is going to improve.” Within fifteen days they said, “Suddenly the temperature has gone up five degrees!” Today London's temperature has gone up after my coming here. It works but they are surprised how it is working.

After all, all these things are promised. The time has come. But you need not tell them! No, don't shock. It's correct, Ray, what you say. It’s very discreet. Ray is a very discreet person. No doubt about it. He has tremendous discretion. And that's what you should use: What to say to anyone and how far to say. It’s a very discreet method. And you must know how to compromise also. You should not be something like a cynic. You must learn to compromise. You must learn to compromise. And understand [that] they are people who are not yet Realised. You are Realised, you are grown into it, you are much more matured. So you have to be much more gentle with them and not to show off to them [that] they feel small. Like somebody is asking a question, maybe stupid, may be, possibly. Doesn't matter, he's not Realised. And if you laugh at him sarcastically or make fun of him, naturally you lose him. You are not to lose these people. You have to get them in, and that is their right, they are seekers. They are seekers. We have to really understand this with great compassion and love for them. They are seekers. We have to work it on them, not to just laugh at them or make fun of them or in any way to put them down. On the contrary, show them due respect because they are seekers as you were. Before that what we were? What sort of people we were? How many arguments we have had with Mother? How stupid we have been? We just forget all that and suddenly we become very wise. No! Wisdom lies in understanding that they have to have their enlightenment. They haven't got it as yet. They have to grow in that light. This is the problem.

Now you have to use your discretion. There's no need to ask me. I will know from your mistakes, where you have done mistakes. But consult each other, consult each other. Talk to each other absolutely freely. There's nothing to be hidden amongst Sahaja Yogis. Nothing to be hidden among Sahaja Yogis. But with elders, with other people, be respectful. Maybe you being young are more active in Sahaja Yoga. Maybe children are still not so developed in it. We have to take all of them together, not to be unkind by any kind of sarcasm because I have told you a hundred times and hundred and eight times now: sarcasm has no place in Sahaja Yoga. This is no way of joking! It's a very sly method. Nobody should beat also, in the same way. It's just the same, other side of the coin. Beating or shouting or putting up your head like this on other people, like this. Many people have a habit of putting their heads like this when they talk to others. Or French people have a very bad habit of putting their face like this. I was surprised. Anybody you talk to ... means nothing goes into his head. I said, “What's happening here?” Is he like a duck? And you say anything, again they will say another thing. I mean, everything has a tail coming out. So is that these are our tails? We should understand that. We should not put up ourselves to such barriers but accept things as they are. And those who have, who come to you, don't get angry with them because by talking or argument you are not going to convince them but by only by Sahaja Yoga. Try to give them Realisation. Do not argue!

Some people think, “If you talk to them sweetly, if you are sympathetic.” No! Also that doesn't work out. You go on wasting your time with them, and they'll go away. They’ll not be there. Where is their Kundalini? How far is it rising? That's the point you should see. Instead of just trying to be very nice to them, then discussion, then this. No use! Waste of time. In the same way if you are angry with that person and argue; it's also wrong. Both are a waste of time. But be gentle and kind and see where is the Kundalini.

Best is to use photographs. And please do not start curing people. Otherwise, I'll find all the sick patients in Sahaja Yoga. They are not to cure. It's finished now. Better not do it. What's the use of curing these people? They are so ungrateful. They have no sense at all and they don't want to do Sahaja Yoga. We are not interested in such useless people. Those who come to Sahaja Yoga will improve in their health automatically. You don't have to give them any treatment. They can work it out on the photograph, that’s all. That's the end of it.

Sit down!

Now, what any other? Maureen? Mark [Rossi], ask some sensible questions. You are good. They have been a very good husband and wife, I must say. Very happy with them. They are a good, ideal couple and I hope they keep it up.

Also there are some people I know who are very much interested in getting everyone married. Now stop it! Till I come back you don't have all these things. Otherwise the mind, it becomes a marriage bureau. Some people have a specialty about it. Instead of loving others' children, also create your own children.

Some people like to play with others' children. It's also not good. Better have your own children. That doesn't mean you just love your own children. But that's how they get that thing satisfied and they don't want to have children and then who's going to bear the children who want to come on this earth? That's a big responsibility.

What else? Ask one or two questions. Gavin, please ask some questions. It's two minutes more.

Gavin Brown: How do we prevent Sahaja Yoga from becoming a cult?

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Gavin Brown: How do we prevent Sahaja Yoga from becoming a cult?

Shri Mataji: Yes, it's possible. Because, you see, you think, “I'm catching. I'm catching.” This madness has come also in Sahaja Yogis. This will become really cultish stuff! It will really become a cult. Nonsense! What are you catching? You are pure vibrations. You give Realisation to anyone - none of your chakras catch anybody else. Everybody thinks, “I'm pure,” - what it is they say?  Holier than holy! What is catching? What? All such dainty darlings are no good. “I am catching. I ! You have to be brave warriors. What is catching? “I don't want to give vibrations with this catching. I don't want to do it.” All right, use the photograph to begin with. But if you have to do it, you should not be frightened. You are swords!

It is true, Gavin, what you said. It's very true. But you look after that part - that none of them should become that, “I am catching this and I am catching that.” And “I don't like this and I don't like Sahaja Yogis doing this.” This is all wrong. This will make a big cult out of it. Of course, that's not possible. You try such tricks and you will know what it means! That won't be possible though. But be careful; you will go out of gear. Nobody has to form a cult. Everybody who is coming to Sahaja Yoga has to be absolutely with both the arms stretched out, “Come along!” Just like your Mother. I should be the greatest cult myself. Why should I bother about anybody else?

This catching business should drop out from your mouth. Everybody comes and says, “I caught it from him.” “I caught up from them.” I am amazed! How can you catch up from anyone? What are you? A dainty darling or what? Now no more it is going to be tolerated! “I caught up from that.” Go and beat yourself with shoes. If you are such a dainty darling that’s what you deserve! You know how to do it! (laughing)

Nobody should say, “I am catching.” Also neglect these things completely. The more your attention you pay them, the more they will sit on your head. Just neglect and go ahead.

What Paul has pointed out is true. This is very common in England, not in India. Nobody says that, nobody. I've not heard one person saying, “I am catching from that person.” Never! They say, “This is my weakness so I must have felt for that.” They never say like that. This is [your] speciality - putting the blame on others. This is typical ego style business. Put the blame on others! As if you are pure and you have caught up from another. It's your weakness. That's all what you should think about.

You are brave people. You have to be very, very brave. Without bravery how are we going to do Sahaja Yoga? Just tell me. You have to love with bravery. In love you don't think and consider and all these things - you just go ahead. Such a powerful thing to love someone.

That “Such person should not be there and such person should not do that" - nothing! Now those people who come for the first time, or are not so much - they may not have proper protocol - that doesn't mean that you get after their heads. Otherwise, it will become a cult.

The first thing is consideration of others! And understanding that they are not Realised, they are not enlightened. This is very important. You must understand this. They are not enlightened as yet. They have not got their vibrations. They haven't got their vibratory awareness. To get angry with them is wrong, absolutely wrong.

What else now? That's a good point. One more point you can ask me because some people are coming.

Also do not allow your weaknesses to sit on your heads. For example, some people have a habit of telling me, “Mother I had this, I was this, I went there and still that is lingering into me.” Then you are absolutely useless! Why don't you take it out? Finish off. Like that. “Still I have been to this yogi, I've been to that yogi. I have done this, I have done that.” It’s done! Finished! In the present time you are pure Spirit. Become that.

What is there to be proud of these nonsensical things? They are no parallel to Spirit. When the Spirit shines the darkness has to go away.

If there is still darkness that means something wrong with you, and if you are wrong, then what are you boasting about? I mean, people have a habit of boasting! Try to be alert and loving; loving and alert. You have to be really alert.

What else?

Yogini: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: It's a little personal question, isn't it? I'll tell you separately, all right? Because this is not the problem of many, all right? General problems should be solved. This is very personal. It's pertaining to you.

What else?

Man: If I follow you, do I have to give up friends who...?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, not at all. Why should you? On the contrary you’ll want all your friends to come and join us. You don't follow me; you follow your Self only.

It's a question of not giving up but your priorities change because your awareness changes. Like I could say that if you take a horse through the streets of Paris, he would not notice anything. For him any dirty place, filthy place, is the same as the any street. If you take a man or a woman, she will notice prostitutes standing on the street. He may be repelled towards them, may not be repelled also, possibly. Mostly he would not be repelled. But if you take a saint or a Sahaja Yogi, he'll have compassion for a prostitute but he will know that she has to learn herself. And he won't go near her. When she will come to him, he can pardon her and look after her. But there is no involvement in her, in no way.

So the awareness changes. You start giving up things which are not spontaneous, which are not living, which are dead. You start living a living life. It automatically works out. You don't give-up. On the contrary you get new friends, lots of. They are all your friends and brothers once you get it. Because the language changes, the style changes. You have the light; they are dark and black. They are still in darkness. So they are fumbling, while you see the things straight. You can help them. But if they are fumbling and trying pull you down, you will say, “No, I can't come that way. Now I'm changed.” You are changed, and they are not yet changed - that's the point.

It's transformation, actual, that happens within us. You don't have to give up, not at all. On the contrary, you must meet other people, you must talk to other people. But, for example, if you have other friends who are anti-God, you won't be able to tolerate their company and they won't be friends anymore. I will think, “They are not my friends. They are anti-God. They are anti-love.” You would not like to waste your time with them, having a whisky party or something. You would not like. What a waste! You would not like. But you may be with them but you may not like.

Many people do like that, I have seen. Many people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga try to spend their time with other people. Some of them do it because they have to do it. I know, I have a double life myself. But My life is such that wherever I am, I am with myself. But Sahaja Yogis try to change, I have seen. They spend more time with Sahaja Yogis than with other people like brothers, sisters, cousins. They start changing that. Either the brothers, sisters, cousins try taking more interest in Sahaja Yoga, or they don't enjoy their company. It's just they may go just to visit or to see someone but they don't like their company, they don't enjoy their company so much. It happens like that, because you are enlightened people. Like drunkards: they don't like non-drinking people. And non-drinking people don't like drunkards. If you go with the drunkards, you are frightened.  And mad people like mad people. It's like that.

So then the company changes. And if you don't change, you really don't enjoy Sahaja Yoga really into its fullest extent. But there's no cult as such. You are saintly people. You are saints. So saints talk in different language. Yes, they are much more congenial and happy with the saints. But they would like to meet people and talk to them and try to bring them, because we have to bring such a lot of people to Sahaja Yoga. But you should not waste your energies with people who do not matter in God's work. You don't feel like. I mean, I don't say that “You don’t!”If you have to go to see somebody, I don't say, “You don’t!” But it happens with some people. And such people can go down because they have influences on these people, and it happens like that. Your priorities change. You only then start enjoying whatever is God's style. You don't like something which is anti-God. Like I don't say, “Don't drink!” I don't say Ten Commandments, nothing. But it happens to you.

There were so many people who were drug addicts who came to Sahaja Yoga. They gave up drugs. Now, how can they be with people who are taking drugs? So they started going to them and talking to them and they said, “We have given up drugs.” All right? There's somebody in Paris whose husband is drinking such a lot, and he is still a drug addict, and she is a Sahaja Yogini. But he comes to My programme, and I told that she should be very kind to him and gentle because he wants to give up. But a person who is dragging her, “You must also take a drug!” Then you don't like that aggression. I mean, you should be allowed to be non-smoking also, if you don't want to smoke. But they don't allow! For them it is difficult. They'll force you, “You must drink. You must smoke!” I mean, you must be knowing this that, if you go to any party, and if you don't drink, they think you are mad! And they'll go on asking, “Why don't you drink? At least take this, at least take this.” If you tell them even once, “Why do you drink?” “Oh, you don't drink?” - finished. Then you are the most anti-social person, you have no manners, nothing. I mean you are telling something nice but they'll go on forcing on you. You have to go on telling them that, “Oh, we don't drink. I don't drink. I don't like it. The Doctor has told me.” All sorts of lies you tell them but they'll go on forcing you. But even if you say once that, “Why do you drink?” or “Please don't drink.” - finished. You are the worst person in the whole world. This is such an aggression! Such an aggression. It's a very subtle aggression of these people who are licentious.

It's funny sometimes, I tell you. Like we went to a party, and at that party there was a funny couple came in - that was a woman who was a keep and this and that, and it was a party of married women and married men. And the way the woman was on with everyone, I mean, nobody liked it, neither the women nor the men. And we didn't like that the man - why should he bring his keep there because it was not a party of keeps? But it's aggression. And she was so aggressive! She was saying, “What's the use of being married to a man after all?” She was just saying all kinds of things against us, those who were married women. “There's no use marrying men. I am very happy. I am a keep. He looks after me better. You better give up your husband and live as a keep with them.” She was just giving us a lecture on her status! And we could not say anything to her. But if we say that it's nice to be a married woman and to be virtuous, “Oh, they are the worst women. You are victorian! You are  old-fashioned hag!” and all sorts of things will come on you!

There's a very big aggression on saints. They can't talk. They can't say anything. While even your own brothers and sisters and mother and father and children will do that, “Oh, you are very old-fashioned. It's nonsense!” Like that. It's not easy to exist with virtue in this country especially, and in the Western countries because now I know what it is.

My husband also doesn't drink so they tell him, “Oh, is it your wife who has forced you not to drink?” I mean, he said, “She doesn't say anything like that. Why do you blame Her?” Immediately [they say]. I mean, there's no shame about it of saying such a dirty thing! I mean, there is shamelessness, complete shamelessness about it. And not only drinking - all sorts of shamelessness goes about. You ask a lady, “Are you married?” “No! Why should I? I am not a fool like you!” It’s a typical answer. I mean, because you are married you have to look like a criminal! Because you are virtuous you should be crucified immediately. When you change that, with these people, you give up, naturally. I mean, you don't want to meet such people. And then they might say that you are cultish but it doesn't matter. I mean, we have to save ourselves. I mean, we do not want certificates from them! The certificate has to come from God, not from these people. They are incapable of giving us certificates. That you know very well.

So should we start? Something else?

Who are the new people today, for the first time? You? I am sorry I had to say all these things because today was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis in the beginning. And we are all going to enter into the same Realm and it will be handy for you to know what is expected of Sahaja Yogis, and with that expectation I request you not to pay attention to what I have said, much. You should not be frightened. It's not that frightening. You'll like it later on very much! What I have said it, you see.

So come forward. Those who have come for the first time, please come forward. You come for the first time? All right. Come forward! Will be better idea.

No, no, here, on the chair. On the first row of chairs. Will be a good idea. Yes.

Actually, it happens that your religion gets enlightened. You become that. Then you can't help it. What to do? I mean you don't have to tell, “Don't do! Don't do!” It just happens. You just can't do it. It's so helpful, isn't it? You just can't do it. You don't feel like doing it! Because if you are enjoying your Spirit you don't feel like doing nonsensical things.

It is better to get it and see for yourself what happens. All right?

That's the best way to give it a full chance.

Those who have come for the first time do come forward. You’ve come for the first time? Please come forward.

No! You are not for the first time!

Let her come forward here.

You are all for the first time here? No. You can go one step backward, is a good idea. You see, you can receive my vibrations even from there where Kingsley is. Isn’t it Kingsley? Aren’t you receiving my vibrations?

Much more! Yes that’s it.

Now this is a system which is built within us. That's why it is called as ‘Sahaja’. This is what is the system within us that exists. ‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’. This is all born with you. You have achieved it. It's all within you. It's a system that is built into this or built into that. In the same way it's a system built into you. You are just ready. You are to be put to the mains. That's all is the job is. For putting to the mains also there’s something built into you. If you see the triangular bone called as ‘sacrum’, means ‘sacred bone’, this Kundalini is there. This is the one that gives you your rebirth. By rebirth what happens [is] that your awareness, which is human awareness, becomes enlightened by your Spirit. Your Spirit comes into your awareness. So far your Spirit is not. Your Spirit knows all about you. It is in your heart. But you do not know about It.

So what happens [is] this Spirit, which is enjoying itself, enlightens your awareness and you get a new awareness by which you start feeling a cool breeze in your hand, a cool breeze in your hand. And this cool breeze, for the first time, on your central nervous system starts flowing. So you feel it, actually you feel it.

Now the enlightenment takes place of all these centres which are within you, which are there because of our evolutionary process. And these enlightened centres are on your fingers. They get enlightened too and you start feeling them within you. You start feeling your own centres and you start feeling the centres of others.

Now this happening takes place within you of the Kundalini awakening just to attract your attention inside. Because your attention is outside, you cannot take it in. You know many people think, “You put your attention here, you put your attention there.”  - it’s all wrong. It has to be spontaneously attracted inside and it's done by this Kundalini, and Kundalini is just like a germinating primule within us, a seed. It just rises spontaneously. And when it rises it breaks through here. And this is what is the real Baptism. You really feel it here coming out. You can feel the cool breeze coming out. You can feel the cool breeze from your hands. This is real Baptism that John the Baptist wanted people to have, and that Christ talked about.

All the religions have taught us to be in the centre. When they said, “Don't do this, don't do that,” they did not want to condition us but to tell us that how we are going to be in the centre. And when we are in the centre then what happens to us [is] that you get the desire to know your Spirit. And this desire is fulfilled through the awakening of the Kundalini. Now the Sahaja Yoga at this stage is really a Maha Yoga in the sense [that] it is the Great Yoga because many people can get Realisation. Thousands of people can get it because the blossom time has come. But even if they get Realisation, they are to be looked after, they are to be nourished, they are to be told about it. Everything should be decoded. You will be amazed - everything becomes so logical. Gradually you start understanding it. Your complete freedom is established.

Nobody says that, “Don't do this!” Nothing is said. But you just don't do it - yourself! I will not tell you as Moses had to tell, poor thing. He had to face all the mad people. But no, after Realisation it just happens and you just don't do it. You will not do it. It just happens to you. It is nothing to be told. It just happens. It works out. This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

In the beginning you have to be really ardent Sahaja Yogis. In the beginning you have to be. It's the beginning of Sahaja Yoga still in England, I would say. Really ardently attached to it by which you develop yourself very well and develop this tree of Sahaja Yoga in your own country. Because you have to save so many. The Last Judgment has started. It's started. Through Kundalini awakening only you judge yourself. You know what are the centres you are catching, what are your problems. You know what are the centres others are catching. You judge yourself.

Supposing a person comes and tell me, “Mother, my Agnya is very bad.” Do you know what it means? That, “My ego has developed.” But [if] you tell somebody, “You have got an ego.” - you will have a punch on your head! But the person himself comes and says, “Mother, I see my ego.” You start seeing yourself. You start seeing your problems, because you are out of it. And then you can cure it also and make it better. You improve it and you are better. You judge yourself and you judge yourself with love and understanding. You don't hate yourself by that. It's only you, yourself. You are going to judge. Within you is the power of God that judges you, is the Spirit which tells you. A rapport is established with the Spirit. The Spirit itself will tell you, “This is the mistake, this is the problem.” We don't need anybody to tell us. It's only you who will know. It’s only you who will judge yourself. It’s only you who will grow yourself. It's your own freedom. It's your own Self.

Your entire personality changes, entire personality changes. I have never told anybody not to take drugs as such, except for one or two people who were still carrying on. But also very mildly. And I told them how to get rid of it. But you just don't want to take them, just don't like it. You find it very filthy. You feel like vomiting. Just like that, the religion is enlightened in your stomach. That the time has come now for you to do it. That was the time when it was not so [then] they taught you how to do it. But today the time has come, it can work out. You are all just there.

The completion of the whole creation has to come this way. It has to work out. But you cannot reason it out. But once you get it - because it’s beyond reason, it happens beyond reason; the Kundalini awakens not by reason, spontaneously, by master only - once it happens then the whole thing becomes logical. You see, there's a microscope, then you can see through it. But if there is not a microscope, you cannot understand.  The ‘microscope’ is your Spirit.

It's very simple.

Now, I do not want to go into details about it. I think these people have been given... Gavin have you given them the papers and things?

Let them see for themselves. Have you all got the papers? Have you got? No? Let her have. Let this lady have. You sit a little erect, all right? Straight, sit little straight. All right.

You have to sit a little erect, not much, but a little erect. Not slouchy. Neither like this. Just sit straight.

Put your hands like this, all of you. Just put your hands.

Now close your eyes. Put your feet like this, little straight, on the ground. Not pressing much but they should be on the ground properly.

Come in! Come! There are three, four seats. Here, in front. Yes.

After Realisation you have to go very fast and try to understand it, otherwise you may lose your vibrations. That happens with some people. So be careful! It's a very, very delicate thing; it's very subtle. And because we are gross - suddenly we become subtle - if we do not catch up to it, we lose it also. So for one month after Realisation you have to be very, very careful and get hold of another Sahaja Yogis here and we also have an ashram here. We have to work it out.

Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. It just works. Just close your eyes. Don't think about it. Don't think. It will work out without thinking.

Put both the hands towards me, please. Both the hands like this.

One of the centres that is catching in most of you is that you all feel guilty for nothing at all, for nothing at all. It's a fashion to feel guilty. So everybody starts feeling guilty for nothing at all. Or maybe we confess and this and that. Now I have to tell you that not to feel guilty at all. Say that, “I am not guilty.”

Thrice you say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

This is also a myth that you feel guilty. That will help you a lot.

Once you get your Realisation you have to also have the spiritual education to know how to handle this, how to handle this power. You are getting it because this is your own right, but you must know what you are getting.

They've got it, all of them.

All the Sahaja Yogis should receive vibrations and expose completely with their heart, absolutely. Just put it. Be meditative today. And you have to promise in your heart. You have to be much more active and ardent about Sahaja Yoga if you have to save your brothers and sisters. Only your heart can be binding, nothing else. Nothing else. It's only your heart. As you are attached to someone you love, you should be attached to your Spirit. Spirit you should love the most. Nobody is more important than your Spirit.

Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands? Not yet? Close your eyes. Have patience with yourself. One has to have patience.

Close your eyes. Have patience! Just don't think. It will work out. Have patience with yourself! You put both the hands towards me, not meeting each other but towards me, separate. Put both the hands separately, not towards each other but towards me. Please put them towards me. Yes.

Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And just leave it. Don't think about it. Don't worry about it. It will work. It's like just a flower becoming a fruit - spontaneously.

Just close your eyes and put your hands towards me. Put your attention to your heart. Catch the joy part of it.

Just heart. Just put your both the hands towards me only and just pay attention to your heart. It will work out.

Are you feeling cool breeze? It's good, great. Just enjoy it. Just enjoy. Do not pay attention in one particular direction. Just leave it free. Just leave it free. Do not fix your attention anywhere. Just leave it free. It will work out.

Gavin, organise for these people behind. Ask people to slowly come along.

Keep your eyes shut. All new people please keep your eyes shut. They are going to check you.

One by one, yes move on. Jill, come forward.

Start moving in the centre. Yes. Good.

Those Sahaja Yogis who want to get themselves also checked up, ask other Sahaja Yogis to do it.

Magda, I think these three people are for the first time or what?

Just see them, their vibrations. They haven’t felt it yet.

Can you move a little coming up here. Marcus? Or who is there?

Those who want to be checked. Also ask others to be checked.

Douglas, go and check Dinesh.

All of you must get checking! Those of you who want checking should raise your hands. Ask people to check you.

Check her.

Vishuddhi, Left Vishuddhis are horrible. I don’t know what to say.

Hester [Spiro], you ask somebody to check you also. Peter [Pearce], you sit down.

David [Spiro] you sit down! Get yourself checked! Linda [Pearce], Peter, all of you. Please. Because I am going away. Let everybody be checked - better is. Marcus? You be checked also.

Better to get it done once for all. Get them checked.

Who can check her? Ray [Harris]? Where is he? Go and check Hester.

He’s got it?

Kingsley you check Hester, it’s better. He (Ray) is a Jew (also) so it would be better! (laughing) Somebody else should do it it’s better.

May God bless you!

But everybody gets checked it’s better!

John, you sit down. You get yourself checked. Sit down.

Marcus? Is he checked? How are they?

Now those who are checking should get themselves checked also, is a better idea. There should be nothing.

‘Prana’ - say the mantra for him. For her, Malcolm [Murdoch], ‘Prana’ is the mantra for her.

Haa! Done. Just broken through. Haaa!

Now this is to be judged a little by yourself. You should know. These are the small things that one should know.

This gentleman? Why don’t you see this gentleman?

Can you check John. John, put your left hand towards me and right hand outside.

Felicity [Payment]. Somebody should check Felicity also.

Brighton people should again get themselves rechecked afterwards.

Everybody should get themselves rechecked. Somehow or other get yourself cleared out. Every one of you. Gavin you also get yourself checked. Everybody should get yourself checked. That's the best way. And we should be thankful to people for checking us and giving us vibrations. Instead of getting angry and upset.

How are the children?  Jane [Brown] bring her. Is she alright? Bring her here.

How is it? Let everybody check today and give bandhans.

What about this gentleman? He’s got it? He’s Ray’s father, he should get it. Tell him not to feel guilty about anything! You are facing Mother who loves you! Just say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

Just say that. What guilt can you people have?

Jill? Coming?

Haaa! Alright Jill? It’s come up.

How is she?

Don’t talk. Just raise the Kundalini. Just raise the Kundalini.

You give him a bandhan.

Chaya, tumse karab dekho. Regis, you also get yourself checked and others should check and you check others. Every one of you.

John, please put yourself into a bandhan. Now check other people. Come along.

Those who have been checking sit down and those who have to be checked.

You’ve done it? Have you done? You’ve got it? Have you felt anything? Did you feel any cool breeze?  Good, great. Now close your eyes. Enjoy your Self. Now don’t stop at that!

What do you say Malcolm? Better?

What about this child?
