Subtlety. Dollis Hill, London (UK), 8 June 1980.

And it is only possible for people who are of a subtler nature to understand the value of Sahaja Yoga, to hold to the values of Sahaja Yoga, and to retain it in this fragmented world.

The world is fragmented and everybody is acting towards one's own destruction. All the values which people follow are gross values. Most of the values are absolutely gross. So for Sahaja Yoga we have to have people who are trying to justify their subtleties. Such subtle people have always been a little different from the mundane crowd. These people always express themselves in such a manner that their existence itself suggests that they are trying to cement the whole world. Sort of, you can feel that those who can feel that there is an element within us which makes us laugh at the stupidity of others who may appear to themselves very seriously doing things but to us it seems as if its rather stupid to waste their life. This is the calibre of different people. First these people, with that calibre, with that dynamism within them, will be settled in Sahaja Yoga. Not the ordinary or gross type.

But because our doors are open to everyone, because there is no charge or anything, for anything, all sorts of people come in. And when they come in, they do not know what they want. Out of them some could be the grossest of all. Some might be just walking in to take out something, just to steal something, possibly. I have seen all kinds of people come to Sahaja Yoga. Such people when they find there is something available, come in and go away. Another kind may be which is coming here, is the one which is extremely gross, can think that he can make some living out of our work here by having connections with different people, he can exploit it and make some money out of it. So money-mindedness is a very gross thing. It is very gross thing. If people are money-minded then Sahaja Yoga does not work out well with them.

If you always think about money, of your insurance, about how the carpet is spoilt, this has happened, that happened; such people are very difficult. But lower than this are the people who come here to have some sort of an exploitation out of Sahaja Yoga. Such gross people also come in and when they find that they cannot work out their plans, they walk out. Now the third type of people who come here come for some material gain from Sahaja Yoga. May be physical gain also. Like somebody is sick so they come for their sickness. A very gross way of looking at things is to come to Sahaja Yoga for getting cured. So when they get cured they disappear. Quite stupid isn't it ? Then some people come with the idea that may be with Mother's blessings our financial problems will be solved; only with that idea. Then they also get their financial problems solved and they get out. But some of them do not. Some of them cannot manage to get what they want and they get upset.

Now the best calibre of the subtlest form is that, which is just seeking "Sahaja Yoga", which is just seeking "Union with God" Nothing    else. That is the best calibre. That calibre works hard, it has very concentrated effort. It understands Sahaja Yoga very quickly. Only thing is that because o - f western habit of thinking some of the people, though they have a calibre, circulate around themselves. They go on thinking about it, discussing about it, arguing about it and then they become stationed at a point, otherwise it goes little round and round itself. They have a calibre, they have a height, they definitely have. As we call they have that 'weight'. They can feel their element, but still they go on as a habit, you see, because they are used to it they go on encircling round and round They have to steady themselves. But calibre of a person who just wants to 'be', to 'become', can never be deterred by anything. Because he is subtle in a way. In his life-time he feels the subtleties of the Unconscious. He has felt his archetype images of these deities. He has known them. He has these eruptions within him. He identifies and he recognizes the subtleties he has felt and he tallies them with Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga gets him like that. Now these subtleties which I am describing to you, come to you, not through your mental effort of this lifetime. But comes to you from the experiences of many lives you have gone through. And as soon as you come near Sahaja Yoga you start sucking. That is the best calibre.

But because the door is open ajar, the grossest of the grossest also come. But sometimes they come this way and go back the same way. Some of them, come half way and rush back. Some of them come this side and get out from the otherside. But those who stay are people who are subtler by nature. It is a very subtle happening. If you have lost your subtleties, say some people, as I said, even doing hard work with your fingers, you become insensitive, even physical disrespect to your fingers you become little bit insensitive. Even when you get your realization, you may not feel your vibrations that good. But that is not important. Of course, vibrations you must feel for realization. But may be due to some external reasons also, or may be due to some physical problem you may get a situation where you may not feet vibrations so much. But doubts would not rise in your minds because there are not vibrations. You would just think that 'the vibrations are not there. I must get my Vishuddhi Chakra all right. But it is there'. And even if the doubts come in, a subtle person will fight it, will argue it out, but a gross person would not.

The subtle person is a brave man, and his bravery comes from his built in capacity of these subtleties. He does not succumb to doubts. He just sees it, he fights it. He does not succumb to it. But Sahaja Yoga is such a wonderful thing that even those people who at one time looked very gross, suddenly came out with such beautiful manifestation of subtleties that it is surprising I But that is exceptional.

The mind in the human brain Is subtle on certain points and gross on some points. It's most surprising ! May be the background. It is a very subtle subject you see. Please pay attention.

If a genius is created. Now we can say we call it a prodigy. But I would call it a genius. There is a difference between a prodigy and a genius. Prodigy is a person who, for a short time of their life span, suddenly become very talented and after some time the talent goes away. And a prodigious person may be mentally absolutely very-very low, low very low. So it is done by some sort of a spirit possession. But a person who is a genius is a person who has those sensitivities. The mind which is covered with thoughts, which is thickened, which is gross can be thinned out at certain points and can be very sensitive at certain points. For example, some people could be very sensitive to music. Some could be to art. Some could be to human beings. Some    could be to other things which might make them something of rare people. But these subtler things which create your personality always indicate in your being that there is something of the beyond which is throwing some images within you. Such people are conscious of that-that there are some images which are throwing these subtle ideas within you, they are erupting some new commotion within you and once you start seeing them you are compelled to put them down somewhere. That's how the poets are created, musicians are created, great masters are created.

Now, the fashioning of these subtle ideas is another job. But the beauty of these subtle ideas is that they are universal in nature. If they were not, they would not be so much appealing to every one. So there is something universal in these. And that universality when manifested or fashioned into some expression then it is absorbed universally. Now it depends on the person how much he is closer to those images and the images of his Spirit. If such a person is a realized soul, then the expression is 'heavenly'. The fashioning of his expression is of course determinist by the surroundings, the different atmosphere, the traditions and all that in which the people have lived. That is the fashioning part of it, but the universal essence of it, that element which is universal is manifested in a particular fashion. The more a person is nearer to his Self even the fashioning is universal in nature, Then such a person does not try to be moulded by tradition so much. But tradition which have come through meditativeness or through realized souls definitely give him a better chance of expression So the fashioning also evolves gradually in every country, in every place, till it reaches the point where people start understanding them in meditation.

Now there are two types of fashioning. One is the fashioning that comes from outside, the other from inside. The fashioning that comes from inside could be the teachings of the "Great Masters", who are realized souls and your own understanding of the work of these Great Masters. The another style, type, could be, you see what the people have been producing all of them and you gather out of that and fashion your manifestation accordingly. In the second type of thing they may be realized, they may not be realized.

Now when we go to Sahaja Yoga even a person who is not a genius, who has never been a genius, who had no idea of any special expression in life can get realization and of the highest type. May be much more than a genius, because the genius may have become a geni-ass by now. You see his ego must have bloated out and he might be a geni-ass instead of a genius.

But a Sahaja Yogi when he gets his realization, this realization is a sign not of his subtleties but of his Kundalini-in what condition She is. If the Kundalini is absolutely frozen that means the person has no desire to have realization. He is coming to Sahaja Yoga to make some money out of it or to make some name out of it or he could be a burglar coming as a Sahaja Yogi to burgle away, say, My shoes. Such a person can be very difficult for realization, but may be with some people who have some basic problems also can have their Kundalini completely frozen up.

But people of very ordinary appearances, of very ordinary life, could be very subtle. Much more , than these geni-asses and geniuses put together. Because they can feel this Self Such people do not cheat themselves or others, no question. Their whole attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is like a person who is dying and gasping for air, they are, just struggling to get the Truth. They have no other interest in life, but to get to the Truth.

Such people could be very strong headed, could be very different from normal. They may think many things stupid. Even, you see, just to have a wife, and children, and family, is quite stupid, isn't it ? That's not the end of life. That's quite a stupid thing to do. I don't say you give up that. But is not the    end of life. It's all right, it's a part of it. You are not to be lost in it.

We believe that marriage is important. We believe that in the marriage husband and wife should be very much understanding of each other. There should be love between the two, there should be enjoyment so that children also feel the security of the family so the society improves--all this is all right. But that's not the end of it. In India you will find many families like that. Husband, wife are carrying on nicely, children are nice and money is in the bank. When they die money goes to the children. Then the children are married nicely, then they have their children. Money goes to the bank. When they die the money goes to the children ... Goes on day in and day out. Nothing. It is so mundane. That does not mean I believe in divorces. Of course, that is something nonsensical. But to be married means you have entered into life. At least you should enter into life. That is important. As far as entering is concerned -basic. But that's just the basic. That's not the end of the life.

If you are a subtler person, you will not think what is your advantage monetarily or what you are doing, what is the thing, what gains you have got. Of course you will see that, as Yoga is established, Kshema will be established, your well-being will be established. You will see that clearly. It is to be seen, to be thankful. And the Kshema is alright because you should not have worry, Kshema. But you should have free time to devote yourself to meditation and to Sahaja Yoga. So that you do not have too much worry. That is how the Kshema comes in. But when the Kshema comes in also one may start going into the same circle of greediness having more and more money, more and more this, better clothes, better house, how to get this ? This circle may start. There is no end to it. So you have to cut it down ' I am not saying that you just have one dress and all your life you end up with one dress. It doesn't mean that. Because you know if I say anything people will shoot off to the other end. I am trying to keep it in the centre. That not too much attention would be required on one side or the other of indulgences or of asceticism None of these. You are not to announce anything, neither you have to indulge into anything.

But feel your subtleties, Feed them, nourish them. Look after them. You should be proud of your subtleties, that you have these subtler values while others don't have. And that itself will be so self-sustaining, that you can withhold all these values which you get from your subtleties against the whole world. Because the world is so fragmented, so cut off, that everybody feels lonely. But that does not by any chance mean that you should be arrogant to others, you should be fighting with others. No. But in darkness a light shines. The whole is darkness. If the light accepts darkness then it becomes dark. The light must accept that, "] am the light. I am the path," and should stand. That does not in any way mean any arrogance to others, any showing off to others. But it is the light and the light by itself emits.

When this happens to you, you will not hate yourself, first of all, but you will laugh and respect yourself and respect the virtues in you and not your grossness. Kundalini itself makes you subtler and subtler. But if you area stone what can Kundalini do ? Now it is for you to see where you are stone. There should be a lot of heart searching ... The greatest 'stone-age' is now a-days 1 Heart is like a stone. Doesn't move. When talking to others it does not move. It has no ripple in it. There isnt any joy in it. It is like stone. Sitting there to hate everyone. If any one sees you-'Oh baba I he's coming; go from the other road. Ooh 1 that fellow with the stone heart!' And you feel you are all right, you are a very good person because you are stone hearted. You think you can dominate the whole world because you are stone-hearted. You can give psychological treatment to others,-'keep quiet, don't talk to anyone,' shout at others, do whatever you please, because you have a stone heart. Nothing happens to a stone there. Now this stone heartedness is the sign that you should not be any more in Sahaja Yoga.

You must have a heart as your Mother has. Pulsating with love, with Compassion, with Joy, with Happiness, with Giving. That should be the attitude.

Not rationality. Nothing. It is to feel. Feeling for the pains of others. Feeling for their longing and feeling for their aspirations. Just feel within yourself, 'is there Desire to be the Whole,' to be the Ocean itself is so fulfilling.

We should not have our ideals among ourselves. Like, she does this so why should I do. He does this so why should I do. It's very mediocre. It's a very low-grade business. To see others, to worry about others, to talk about others is extremely low grade.

A person who is of a calibre has his standards much higher that he cannot compare himself with others. It's really true.

So if I start comparing Myself with you, what will be My position ? I can't do it, you see.

Then you say it's all right for you, Mother.

It's perfect, I agree. it is all right for Me as I am, but, you can be like Me also. But if I
start comparing and thinking 'Oh God 1 What is this 1' Then I should give up doing anything, thinking where have I come.

I But when you know that you are not comparing, you are just Giving, question of comparison should not arise al all. At all. It is just 'feeling'. I just feel. In the same way you feel each other.

Not in a artificial courteous way. Some people think that if they have given seat to some one, they have been really the generous people, the greatest generous people. Just be yourself now, Let's see. Just be yourself. And that you are the light 1 What is the comparison ! The comparison exists when our calibre is low. If it is 24 carat gold. What is the comparison ? It's Absolute. If you are at an absolute point there's no comparison. So try to see that your calibre is that. That you are of that calibre. And don't worry about gross people. Gross are gross, will remain gross, you just don't worry about them. You keep your calibre all right and that is the most essential part of Sahaja Yoga.

Thank you very much.

Paul : They always tell me you are actually God. Well I can't see that at all.

Mother : All right. Put your hands towards me. Ask the question, it's simple, like computer. Work out your computer. Just ask the question. Finished.

She (Kundalini) is the one who is the desire of God Almighty. She is the power of God and it is only She who incarnates. If you read the Vedas it is said that She created Her child, and the first sound that was created was the Child and that sound is the sound what we call as Brahma or the Logas as they call I it. So now what is the difference between God and God's desire? What is the difference between Sun and sunlight. What's the difference between Moon and Moonlight. What is the difference between the word and the meaning.

So the God Almighty, Him, who people understand is just a witness. The day these two Things will meet, there won't be any world left. Till they are separated all those things happen. When they meet and merge into each other, there is nothing left, It just becomes the sound, Brahma-nothing.

We cannot understand these things because we have never seen two things that merged together as God and His Power. We cannot understand anything like that because there is no parallel. Now, you can rationally also see things; that people, when they bend before me, their Kundalini starts moving. It is written in the scriptures only at the feet of Adi Shakti this would happen. Not only that, but you people who have not been through any austere life have got your realization and that your own power is giving them realization. Isn't it ? There is no one in the whole world today, there may be some realized souls, who can give the way you give realization. You go and talk to some great Gurus, they are jealous of you. They know who I am. They have told people who I am. But they are jealous that they don't understand why of all the things I have given you these powers while they don't have; they can't give realization the way you give; in a second like this, nobody can. You can go and have a look at them. They are great people no doubt But your Kundalinis work like jets. They move like elephants from one Chakra to another Chakra. The Kundalini does not move that way as it moves, because I have given the Authority. You can go and meet them and they will tell you. There are thousands of people they have got disciples. But they do not send them to me. They say 'Mother' you will find your calibre! These gross people you leave it to us. We will manage them, We will send them later on, just now you find your subtle people.

Why Sahaja Yogis are few is because there are very few subtle people in this world of that calibre. That is why I am always requesting you, do not divert your attention here and there. Settle down. Become good Sahaja Yogis. Unless and until you really become good Sahaja Yogis I cannot move to the second strata because the first strata is not yet settled down, they are worrying about nonsensical things I mean I just sometimes feel very unhappy to see you fight amongst yourselves, I mean this is something so painful; that you say harsh words to each other, I mean you are the cream for Me. You go and ask any one of the Gurus if they can move the Kundalini on their fingers as you do it.

These powers cannot be given by an ordinary person. I look ordinary no doubt, I have to, but also you have seen Me in other forms-that's not important. The important thing is you should see your own transformation and how many powers are manifesting. If you go and tell somebody that I have started giving realization and raising Kundalini they will say 'You are mad, How can this be ? Impossible.' Nobody is going to believe you at all. You see, you have got it so easily. Why ? Because I recognize that subtleties in you. These Gurus recognize Me. They know about Me. They know who I am. They are telling others. They're so many of them like that.

First of all know that you have these powers within you. Then know that you have got them because I have Chosen you. All right. Good, see now.

Only thing you get rid of your egos which give you ideas. Sometimes they come like big balloons, so tell yourself, "Mr. Ego, Please get out. These powers I have got because Mother has chosen me, has loved me, has nourished me and has accepted me as Her child."

It is a fact. Nobody can believe that you give realization, I tell you. You go and tell anybody. You should; but they are not going to believe you. If this flower says that I can become the lamp in a light house, nobody is going to believe it, because the light in the lighthouse is made in a special factory. But supposing this flower says, or if this flower says that I can cure your diseases, then nobody will believe you, but it may! When some thing fantastic happens, we have to believe that there is Divine acting and acting so dynamically! Only thing, do not waste your energies in gross hankerings and gross wanderings and ramblings. Try to be subtler and subtler.

There is nothing that I have to ask for. Now you think it from God's point of view. You are to be given realization, first job. Its a headache, you know. Somebody has to take up the headache of Giving Realization. It's much easier to be crucified once but to be giving realization a hundred times, to all kinds of funny Kundalinis to be raised, you cannot imagine. And then after giving realization to tell you all about it. To decode all chakras, to show you all the chakras to tell you all about Deities, these archetypes and everything. And every word of it is true and Acts and Works. You have experimented and found out Somebody has to come down.

It has been My lot to come. I don't mind and as I told the other day, one of you takes my seat I'll be very happy to be a Sahaja Yogi sitting down there. I will be the happiest person. I will give you fine garlands like this and all the flowers from the market, I will bring for you-if you could sit here and do the job for Me.

It is very easy to doubt, but can you do the job ? You can not. This is the trouble with the western mind, is -that it doubts. What are you doubting about ? What is there to doubt ? I cannot doubt Myself. That's very difficult. When you know that this is the Truth how can you doubt ?

Now if you doubt what can I do ? How to prove it ? Best way is to understand My Love, through that you will understand Me better. Its much easier to understand Me through your heart than through your brains. Because I am very good at blasting them., and I play about with you lots of things by which I really give you a very difficult time Because if you start thinking, I make you think more. If you start doubting I make you doubt more. So best thing is to see. As I told the other day that whatever is in the next room, better to go in and see, than to sit down here and doubt. Or to accept it and sit down here. No. Go and see for yourself.

You have seen it yourself. But just think how Tremendous It is ! Just sit down and think how great 11 is, how Dynamic 11 is, that you have seen It with your Own eyes. Just think that you have Felt it, that You are the people who have got it. You are the first few who have known It. They may be thousands and thousands later, the whole Universe may take it up bus you are the first few. You prove your calibre.
Come up.

May God bless you.
