 July Aug Volume XI issue : 7 & 8 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze Shivratri Puja '99 Delhi, 14/02/99 It is a very long lecture I have given in others, to have envy for others, all these Hindi Language because there are very reactions within us act and our heart become like a stone. It cannot reflect. You telling them was that the principle of Shiva have to reflect the quality of Shiva, which is in your heart and that reflection is not is very important today in this Kaliyuga on a Chakra but like a mirror. Now There are very few people who are really whatever is visible of you is this mirror. reflecting the image of Shiva in their own In this mirror what reflection you have? character So. it is important to watch Do you have a reflection which is clear, yourself and see for yourself as to what clean ? Have you cleansed your heart? is wrong with you. Where is my attention Have you cleansed your mirror that is going? Where am I going? What am I doing? Go on judging yourself and not others. One of the Western things is that Now what I told them at length was this they think they have a right to criticise that how there are six enemies we have others, everybody. I like it. I do not like got and all these six enemies, one after it Who are you? Why do you say that? another try to corrupt us. Out of that I Somebody has made a beautiful, say, have told them about five. The sixth does arrangement for you. you sit in his house few Sahajayogis from abroad. What I was reflecting? That is what one has to see. not exist much in India which we call as nicely and say I do not like it, to hurt that lust. It is much l√®ss but for foreign countries one has to know that it is one you think of yourself? Who are you to of the major things that they have in the judge? For Sahajayogis it is prohibited to West because they think that lustful life say, I like and I do not like. It is prohibited. is the only life worth living. person. After all, who are you? What do Look at Shiva. He likes everything. What he wears, also snakes. He likes all kinds of animals, every type of thing that we think is not good, but for him they are not. For example in his Wedding he took with him, in his Baraat, people who were all infirm. Some people had one leg, some Bevond that is Shiva and that is why we have to understand that in our heart the reflection of Shiva is only possible, in complete form. when we have cleansed our heart. To have malice for others, to have lust for others, to have anger for

 July Aug 1999 Volume : XI Issue : 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze beings into selfhood, into self awareness, into the spirit. This has to be done and the time has come. This evolutionary process has started. There are so many of them who have got it. people had limbs broken down, some had only one eye. All such people he carried with him. To him these people were very dear and he looked after them. Because he is the source of joy. He is the one who gives us joy and the one that makes us Now the old saints and people who were Gurus, real Gurus, they used to really test joyous. The real joy is only possible if in your the disciples by making them stand on hearn his reflection is there, but if your their heads for years together. Sometimes heart is full of all these things, then, once put them in the water, do all kinds of I described, it becomes a dirty, very very things. They used to beat them and they were very harsh testing all of them and then only one of them used to get realisation. Now what I thought of is, that it takes too much time to cleanse them, dirty mirror. Very surprising. I told them also that compared to Indians, Westerners are not so particular, Western Sahajayogis are not so particular about their comforts. Though they come from a very materialistic surroundings, they are not so much bothered. They can live anywhere. They can be happy anywhere. to put them into all kinds of dresses, this, that, send them to Himalayas or to Gobi Desert. I thought it will take too much time. I said why not first enlighten, give them the light? In that light they can see their problems and they will themselves That is a very good stage they have reached and that is what the Indians must try to follow, and do not pay attention to nonsensical things. It is not necessary to waste your energy on nonsensical things. correct themselves. They will be their own Guru and it was successful, it was good. Now you can see for yourself what you are doing, what is your problem, what makes you so much different from others Then only you can have real Bhakti for your Self, for your Atma and that is what Shiva's place is above the head, above is needed today that your spirit should your thoughts, above your mind, above shine in your character, in your behaviour your emotions. It is here and you have to and in your personality. If that happens then you have achieved what Sahajayoga wanted to do for you. It is important Only when you do not react to things and today, very important. If you read the and what will elevate you because Sada cross this limit. also to you, nothing is more important than Shiva, then only it will work out. newspaper you cannot read it and what you need is to change, the transformation So, in somethings Indians have to learn and in somethings you foreigners have to as we in Hindi call it Parivartan of human Lrank

 July - Aug Volume XI Issue : 7 & 8 1999 666 The Divine Cool Breeze learn. So many things you have done I to contribute for N.G.O, you are allowed must thank you very much People used to think that I cannot do anything. You of people who want to work it out This have given up drinking, you have given up all kinds of bad habits. You are not our attention for people who are in great womanisers. Your attention is so clean. trouble around us. to contribute. We have a very good team is something I thought that we must have So many things you have done which is really praiseworthy but still you must learn that still there are certain things lingering which must be cleared out and must be absolutely finished. So, this N.G.O. will work for women who are left by their husbands, by their families, who have nobody to be looked after by, and also their children. Still I have not made the whole plan but before starting Sahajayoga I used to do lots of things like that. So I have quite a lot of experience. Our attention should be really towards people who are in trouble now, You do not have very much politics but sometimes there is also politics. Group forming is there. All these has to go away because for Shiva what is this. The as we are now blessed with Divine Power. Universe is at his feet. To have one group here and one group there, all that does not matter to Him. It does not come into his head, you see. For a person, like very big ocean, it touches many shores but in itself it is a big ocean. In the same way is Shiva principle and you all should develop that principle of Shiva and then see the joy, the joy of this great ocean of love. May God bless you. We should look after those who really deserve our attention. You will be very happy to know about women who are destitutes, recommended by Sahajayogis will be a better idea and it can be worked out very well. So far we have not got any application of women who want to have protection. Also we are going to teach them different arts and crafts and things so that within two years they will be able to stand on their legs and there would not be any more beggars on the street. Talk on NG0-Delhi - 13-2-99 We have started one N.G.O. for destitute Firstly we will make them Sahajayogis. women and children, plus we will be Then we will work it out and I am sure having a hospital here. As you know we you will like the idea of having one have been rumning a good hospital in Belapur near Vashi, New Bombay and this hospital will be in Noida. Today. you will be happy to know that we have now taken the land in Noida, and we are going to start our work there. Whatever you want N.G.O. here. Then the second one will be starting near Bombay, Vaitarna That I had planned before, about fifteen years back but they would not give us permission. Now it has

 1999 Volume : XI Issue : 7 & 8 July Aug The Divine Cool Breeze been finalised. We have got the permission. So, I want to start an organization where to educate boys and girls but mostly first boys we are trying. Those boys who have failed in 8th class and 9th class, to learn some vocational for writing that book which I did fifteen years back but the Government was so bad, it would not give me permission. Luckily now with this BJP Government I have been able to get the permission and we are going to do it in a very big way and there are many people who are coming forward to help me in that venture. So now Sahajayoga is spreading outward to give sustenance and help to people who require real help from people. This is a new movement of Sahajayoga and I hope it will be successful. things like small small things. We do not have good electricians, good plumbers, all kinds of things like that. So they will also stand on their legs because after failing in the 9th class or 8th class, they have nothing to do. They are absolutely in trouble. This I started 15 years back. Now Mr. Amartya Sen has written it now, I mean not in such good details. But he has written and he got now a Noble Prize Thank you.

 July Aug Volume XI Issue : 7& 8 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze DIWALI PUJA - CABELLA 25-10-98 Talk by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Diwali Puja is a very small Puja but starting I went to the waiting room andI extremely significant. Firstly, in Diwali, was surprised, she was sitting in the the first day they buy something for the waiting room there! I said, "What are you family. May be some cooking utensil, doing here? They are all waiting for you could be an ornament for the wife or outside." So she said, they asked me to something else, because that is the day of sit here. So, I went out and I told them housewife and that day is to be celebrated that now she is sitting there. Why don't as the housewife's, I should say, homage you call her to sit in her seat? "Is she the to her. As a result you know in India, even wife?" I said, of course, "she is the wife." now, housewives are very much We thought she was some secretary! respected. Actually they are respected all said what made you think? This lady, you over. You will be amazed that even in the see, was wearing modern ideas, wearing protocol of the Government Receptions a very modern silk dress and all that and anywhere, the wife is very important., everybody thought that this lady must be Where she is sitting, what is her position, the secretary at the most. So they made is very important. Even today, in the most her sit in the waiting room. So, it is modern and advanced countries also they expected of a housewife to be decently have a special respect for the housewife. dressed, honourably dressed and not to Housewife may not be educated, she may dress up like a secretary or somebody be a very simple woman, she may not be who is just in the office because she is regarded as the highest whether you like it or not. But she had combed her hair There was an experience for me. In and she has been to & very expensive place London we had a Programme where we for all decorations and everything, and all were invited and the wife of the head poor thing when she arrived, they put her of the delegation was missing. So they in the waiting room near the bath room. very modern. asked me where is she because there is a That is what it is. seat for her. She has to sit there. I said, I So, for a housewife, she is the dignity of the house. Not only that but she is don't know. I did not see her. She must be somewhere here. So just before

 July Aug 1999 Volume : XI Issue : 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze responsible for the complete culture of kind of a great collectivity of housewives that country, complete culture of that that has to work out. They have common country. They represent the culture. Like problems, they have to face their children, in India now they have started, in the they have to look after the households, films, showing all kinds of things, funny everything. I mean there are so many funny dresses but I have not seen any common problems with the housewives housewife wearing that. I have not seen and the housewife also knows all little anybody. It is not in reality. It is only in the films, because the society is so strong little things. Men, atleast in India, do not know much because they live in the air, I think. So, and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person. She has to be decent. She the women have more sense in this has to be very dignified and she has to behave in a dignified manner. respect for small small things. They are quite aware. It is very interesting. On the contrary, I would say, we had a Sometimes the men commit mistakes of Prime Minister called Lal Bahadur such a great humour because they do not deal with day to day life, with all the problems of daily life. On one side, the Shastri. His wife was absolutely uneducated because Shastriji went to jail woman housewife has to deal with the and she could not take her education. daily life, on the other side she has to look after her family, her children. Also, poor thing, she is responsible for the society, she has to maintain the society. In a Very simple ordinary woman. She went to France. That time there was this Mr. Degol. He was the President and his wife was another very simple woman. So country where women are sensible and Shastriji told her that you are not to cry when we are leaving Mrs Dogol. Now are matured, you will be amazed that they we have become great friends. God become extremely good families, good knows, she did not know French, she did societies and good children. That is why not know Hindi but somehow both of Imust say India is a very good country, a them became great friends, on the level very good society. This has come out of of housewives. He warned her not to cry. the housewives, the Gruhalaxmis of the What happened that they started crying house, who have done all the work. That when they had to leave. So Shastriji said, is important as far as the culture is I told you not to cry. She said that it is concerned. This kind of thing is very much she, this French Lady started crying, what in India and with that what you find that can I do? I had to cry. So you see it is the people respect, respect the housewives.

 July Aug 1999 Valume: XI lssue: 7 & B The Divine Cool Breeze So, respecting the housewife is the most important thing in our Sahaja culture but if they do not show any respect, the children can never respect the mother. It is something criminal to do to women that does not mean that the women should try to dominate and trouble and fight with who are in the household, doing all the the husbands but it means a very work for you, looking after you, your important position in the society of a family, not demanding anything housewife. She is treated as something Only if you want to understand how they can be troublesome, see them in the like a Devi but she too has to be a Devi If you treat her like a doormat then children will never respect her. If you do Ppolitics. When they go in the politics, they put all men upside down and one woman can put all of them in their proper senses not pay proper respect to her, the children will not respect the mother and there will be no impact of the mother on the because their field is their house, their children. As a result the children get family. If they are not respected in the waivered That is why in the society or in family, they get out of the family and the countries where the mother is not behave in such a manner that you can't respected, you will find the children imagine. Though she has to bear a lot, become extremely dominating, hot she has to suffer a lot, but in the family. tempered and horribly uncollective. she must be respected. That is a very very important message of Gruhalaxmi. So, it is very important that on this day. Then the second day is the one where this we call it Dhan Teras, the 13th day, you horrible Rakshsa called as Narkasura was have to buy something for vour wife and killed. Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti. This Narkasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people and had turned lots of cunning stuff. He was a very treacherous cunning you have to give her something as a present. Atleast you should buy a little pot or something that can be used in the kitchen to show your respect to her. In the families where mother is not man and it was impossible to kill him. But then, somehow e the other, with the advent of a special power that this Narkasura was killed. That was the respected, children become extremely troublesome and the whole of their family also sutfers, wherever they are married, whatever happens to them. Men have to realise it is their mistake that they have another day, fourth day when Narkasura was killed. They say that when he was killed the door of hell was closed. So reople should take their baths early in the never respected their wives as they should have In the presence of the children if they shout, in the presence ofthe children

 10 July Aug 1999 : 7 & 8 Volume : XI issue The Divine Cool Breeze morning, but I am of the opinion that, that day if the door is opened, better not to take bath. Be in your beds till this fellow he was crowned also as the King. So it is long time back, thousands of years back, this thing has happened. That jubilation is very significant, that the right king gets is put fully into Narak. You should not his own throne and he rules and all bother about him. Narak means Hell and injustice and all kinds of atrocities he has from the Hell they extracted him and killed him. gone through, has to be completely finished from his life and that is why Diwali is important. The last one is the best where they have the meeting of Sri Rama and his brother Bharata. Shri Rama went to jungle obeying his father and for 14 years he was in the forest. It was a kind of a jail only because from palaces he was sent to the forest by his father. His wife and also the brother, they went into great sufferings and you know the whole story of So the last day they worship the Goddess Laxmi because it is her blessings that brought forth all these beautiful meetings and that is why they worship Laxmi, as I said. But there are nine types of Laxmis now within us which I think 1 have told you sometimes back. Now in that Laxmi Puja, is this that you worship the Laxmi herself. It does not mean money, not at all. To worship money is wrong. What it means that Laxmi is the money which is with us or whatever prosperity is with us should be very carefully spent because she is very mobile and the money can slip out. Ramayana. The child that lived in the palaces had to go in the forest and live in terrible conditions when he was to be the King. It was too much but Sita went with him and she supported him and ultimately it so happened that Ravana came and took away Sita. Shri Rama fought Ravana, On the contrary you should not be at all miserly. With a miserly people, Laxmi is not happy, but if you want to spend, you must spend it in the right way otherwise killed him and brought back his wife. When they came back to their own capital in Ayodhya, there was a big jubilation, and Bharat, his brother, he was very much the money is spent in the wrong way. Now when the Laxmi was created, must be out attached to his brother and he ruled that country with the 'Paduka', they say, is a kind of Sandalwood Chappals they used, of the churning of the Sea she came out. of his brother. He put it on the throne She had four hands. One hand was to and ruled. So that is how the Bharat give, she is generous. She gives, like this she gives and with one hand she blesses. Milap, the meeting of Bharat with Shri These are her two hands, one is to give Ram, is celebrated and that was the time

 July Aug 1999 11 Volume : XI issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze and to bless the person. Very important it inside and sleeps very nicely and is that when you give to somebody comfortably. Even the beetle, is something you forget about it and you undisturbed. That is how one should treat, bless that person. Now only you give if you have money. But here, what I find money but also you bless that person. in the world now, if your have money you Other two hands have got two lotuses of become yourself like a beetle. It is so full of thorns and horrible ideas, so insulting and think no end of yourself. Just surprising that money we should give them, the form of Laxmi, Laxmi Sarupa they become like Devils and the way they pink colour. Pink is the colour of love and a person who has money should have a house which is full of love. Any guest who comes in the house should be respected. He should be treated just like God. treat other people is even worst than that. So this is the significance of the form of the Goddess but the best is she is just standing on the lotus. That means no In India, you have noticed how they think of foreigners Foreigners means God to them. Here foreigner is a bad word but in India it is very respectable. If you are foreigner means you are God. How they have looked after, you know that, in India! This is the reason. This is the basic pressure on anyone. She exists on her own. No pressure. She does not put any pressure on any one. Just on her own she stands and all her weight and all balance TH culture of India that anybody who is a guest, he may be anything, if he is a guest, then he is to be treated like God. In other on her own dignity. This is the way a Laxmi should be and that is how if it happens, in the countries countries it is just the other way round, where people are now having financial crises and all kinds of crises, things will improve. People will enjoy. They do not enjoy their money, nothing. They do not enjoy. This is just aggressiveness and also funny ideas of ha ving something very expensie thing when whst you call the deslgners. Nowv I think these designers are anti Laxcmi that they have come you know. If vou are a foreigner then people think that it is not even proper to talk to them. I do not know how the mentality is like that, but not in Sahajayoga. Sahajayogis are not like that. They treat the guests very well. I have heard, they look after each other and they are beautifully collective. So this is what is the meaning of the Lotuses, is the house full of love. Like a beetle which has got because they are extracting all your money nicely and all your money goes to even thorns, when it comes to the lotus, waste. If not that, then people take to the lotus opens out and the beetle goes

 July Aug Volume : XI Issue : 7 & 8 12 The Divine Cool Breeze 1999 dresser. I said I did not know this, they womanising or to drinking, such wasteful habits. They do not do anything which you can call as really the blessings of the do not go to the hair dressers. That is why they think that you are from the royal family. Just imagine what ideas people have about hair dressing and all that. But in India or these places a woman must be Laxmi. So one has to remember that when you want to give something to someone, do properly combed up. She should not look it with the full heart. Such full heart that it forms that Laxmi Prasada. So that should happen, otherwise what is the use like a hippy going around, because we have many people who still believe in a kind of a hyppism and they wear their hair of giving presents to any one? They are very funny people, you know, who give presents out of their very narrow outlook but they try to give presents. Like in Japan, if you go, they will give you such a big present. You go on opening and opening and opening and opening, till you come to a point where you will get a match box. In the match box inside you will take to, you can say, two doll like things made out of small little match sticks. Start looking at it, what it is. Why such a big design and very surprising. But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple. When we went there they told us wherever we went, you know, even in a shop, when it was raining, they would give us a present. I said, what is this. Why are they giving us a present like this? So the lady who was translating, she said they think you are from a royal family. I said what makes them feel we are from dress like that. Now woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you. Whatever way she wears, whatever she goes about also, the children become much more, from the mother than from the father. Sometimes could be much more from the father also. But actually all the fine things are picked up from the mother. So it is more for the ladies to understand how they dress up, how they live. I went to London and asked one Indian Sahajayogini what is the fashion now. So she said, 'Jhipria' in Marathi. Jhipria,' means if you put your hair like this. See in India if you have hair like this, the mother will say now remove your Jhiprias because if you put your hair like that, your eyes can become squint. But that is the fashion to put the hair like this, you see, very much, sometimes on the eyes also. So that is the 'Jhipria' fashion and this now is quite common, I find, everybody, dignified ladies also, except for Mrs. Thatcher, everybody puts a royal family? Because you do not go to hair dressers. I said, really. Yes, in Japan royal family people never go to a hair

 July Aug Volume: XI Issue : 7& 8 The Divine Cool Breeze 1999 (13 his character. It is alright. You must know that he does not mean it because he really does not know anything. Also in art, I do on this kind of a thing. I do not know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it? But anybody who does anything that should not be followed by women, it is very not think men know much about art Also their one side is missing, that is aesthetics. Poor things they make one type of dress. wear all throughout. Just one type of dress they will make and that they will make and wear throughout. They do not have any demand. But women are artistic. If our Indian women give up wearing sarees and take to jeens where will the slavish Because this is the fashion that is why they do, that is the fashion, so they do. It is absolutely stupid to do that way and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions. You are independent, must stand on your own character, must stand on your own understanding of things. Instead of ruining your faces, you villagers go, because they live with the sarees that they make during holidays and should try to improve them by your dignity, by your understanding. Now it is things like that. So, in India, it is not possible to introduce all these dresses. In more on the women, I am sorry to say, Laxmi Puja is more on the women, That is why they have to understand, what they have to be, how they should do. the school, may be, but later on they all give up because they like sarees. So the sarees are still on and will be on because it is so artistic, it is so beautiful. One saree does not look like another saree. So the idea of beauty and the idea of art is much 1 have already told you that it is necessary for a woman to be dignified, very much more than the man. Men can be stupid, does not matter, you see, does not matter so much but women have to be dignified and sensible. And men as it is do not know much as you know very well. Poor things. more with the women not with the men and so one should see that if men do not know, does not matter but you make your houses absolutely artistic. Make it comfortable like the lotus as I said, that should be such. But some of the ladies you know: They are educated only in Universities but as far as the practical side is concerned, they do not know anything. So. one should not feel bad about it.I in the household, very dictating. It should can be very much like a Hitler, you know, mean it is very enjoyable to see the way men make mistakes and then they go on be like this, that should be like that, making the life of men absolutely saying, No, No, I know this, I know that. They do not know anything. But men will never say I do not know, you see. That is miserable. I have known a person who used to carry a newspaper in his house. I said, why you carry this all the time. He

 1999 14 Volume : XI Issue : 7 & 8 July Aug The Divine Cool Breeze were sixteen thousand people. So, how could we give these presents. So, the women took out their chains and they said alright we will give it to men. Alright, we will give them our ear tops, alright, and they were making fun of men who were feeling bad that they could not get said, whenever I sit, I put the newspaper first and then I will sit. Why, because if it is spoiled a little bit, my wife will shout at me. I said, why. Because she does not like anything to be spoiled. So she is so particular. I carry a newspaper always with me wherever I have to sit I put the anything. Such fun, you know, much understanding because they are not so money oriented, I think, and they are very spiritual men. So a spiritual woman should not bother about other things like this and will keep a dignity of her own and will show by her every gesture that newspaper. I said, it is too much.

Whatever you give, should be auspicious. Like sometimes I have seen little children out of mischief will bring a lizard and try to give me. I mean it is very inauspicious to do that but they are not told, you see, that it is inauspicious. So, they are doing like that. They are to be told that it is not auspicious, it will not please the Goddess.

So I have tasted them with my teeth. I have put my teeth on to them and that you should not try to insult the Laxmi by giving something which is wrong. If you do not know, you should find out and do it properly. I have tasted. So please have them. Immediately he took it.

It is a unique knowledge with which I was born. It was not so easy to reveal it and I People said that he cannot talk. It has to be experienced. So very few people got to swallow it. Nobody could actualise the experience by feeling on their finger tips, wanted to find out how to reveal it, or feel it on their senses, or on their minds, or even understand it with their intellect. so it was a big problem. They all tried and prepared a ground for it. First of all I thought that the seventh chakra must be opened, which I did, on Sth of May 1970, It is a secret in a way. Formerly, the Brahma Chaitanaya was Avvakta. It was not manifested. It was Now I have come as the Incarnation of the Brahma-Chaitanya As a Whole. The sea of the Nirakar has now become a big cloud (Saakar). It has taken a form. Those who came before were all a part-and not expressed by itself, and so the people who managed to reach Brahma Chaitanya somehow, by attaining Realisation", said - It was Nirakar Ka Guna. You are like a drop that gets dissolved in the ocean parcel of it. Now the whole has come No one could say, explain or tell people This cloud has rain water. The rain water anything more about it.

They managed to talk about Chaitanya Lahiri This was so because of its-Avyakta form. It was only a state. A state to be enjoved, only in that state with got dissolved in it.

are left by their husbands, by their
families, who have nobody to be looked

not made the whole plan but before
starting Sahajayoga I used to do lots of
things like that. So I have quite a lot of

of giving presents to any one? They are
very funny people, you know, who give
presents out of their very narrow outlook
but they try to give presents. Like in
Japan, if you go, they will give you such
a big present. You go on opening and
opening and opening and opening, till you
come to a point where you will get a
match box. In the match box inside you
will take to, you can say, two doll like
things made out of small little match

this. Why are they giving us a present like
this? So the lady who was translating, she
said they think you are from a royal family.
I said what makes them feel we are from
dress like that.
Now woman plays a very big part in the
society as I told you. Whatever way she
wears, whatever she goes about also, the
children become much more, from the
mother than from the father. Sometimes
could be much more from the father also.
But actually all the fine things are picked
up from the mother. So it is more for the
ladies to understand how they dress up,
how they live. I went to London and
asked one Indian Sahajayogini what is the
fashion now. So she said, 'Jhipria' in
Marathi. Jhipria,' means if you put your
hair like this. See in India if you have hair
like this, the mother will say now remove
your Jhiprias because if you put your hair
like that, your eyes can become squint.
But that is the fashion to put the hair like
this, you see, very much, sometimes on
the eyes also. So that is the 'Jhipria'
fashion and this now is quite common, I
find, everybody, dignified ladies also,
except for Mrs. Thatcher, everybody puts
