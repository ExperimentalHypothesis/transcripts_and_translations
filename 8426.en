You must pray to God and ask what you want.  Ask for complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my hear, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful.  Give me love, love that I could love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.  Give salvation to this humanity which is suffering.  Take me to Your feet.  Cleanse me with Thy love.

You’ll see if there is God or not.  You can feel it within yourself.  He hears you; He understands you.  He’s the glory of all the glory.  He loves you, He protects you, He guides you.  He’s created you to reveal His love, but accept it.  Any time any thought is coming, you pray and you will be moving in the wave of that ocean which is unconscious mind, He starts with thoughtless awareness.  

If you cannot become thoughtless, pray to it.  Forgive me for what I’ve done and forgive those who have done harm to me.
