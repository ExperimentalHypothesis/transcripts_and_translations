霎哈嘉瑜伽公開講座

1990年11月5日 曼谷

我向所有真理的追求者致敬。開首之先,你們要知道,真理是如其所如的。你們不能將真理概念化,亦不能組織真理。同時以人類的知覺,你們不能感知真理。你們要成為更精微的存有。真相是:你們不是這個身體,不是這個思維,不是這個情緒,你們都是永恆的靈。另一個真相是,有一個無所不在的、上天浩愛的力量存在。所有經典都描述過這個力量,靈性上昇進的目的,是要找到永恆的靈。你們要成為真我,除非你們成為真我,否則你們會感到某種空虛,你會覺得十分不安。

這個無所不在的力量,造就所有關乎生命的工作。看這些美麗的花朵,我們視之為理所當然。我們不會去想這些花朵,如何從一顆種子生長出來。我們內在也有一個系統,是能夠生長起來的,使我們得到重生。這些你們不能用錢來買,就好像我們不能給錢大地之母,來償付她給我們孕育的萬物,我們不能用錢來買這一切。但人們忘記了,這些都是無價的。而且有許多假導師出來,招攬門徒,賺他們的錢。

所有宗教都是由那些降世的神祇和先知所開創的。但現在都變成人為的宗教,如果我們是聰明的話,便應知道那些人不能為我們做些甚麼。所有這些先知和降世神祇,都是來自同一棵生命之樹的,都是來自同一棵靈性之樹的。只是人們摘下那些花朵,然後說這是他自己的,他們執著那些死去的花朵,互相鬥爭。因此那些先知和降世神祇並沒有錯,我們要看清楚每一樣事物的本質,每一個宗教的本質都是追求永恆,知道物質界的有限。物質界是過渡性的,因此我們要明白這一點,才去利用物質。

現在到了人類這個時刻,有一點很重要,你們必須知道,就是有一個新時代已經開始了,這是個集體得到自覺的時代。我很抱歉很遲才來到曼谷,我想好像這是近來我最後才到訪的國家。現在已經在56個國家有霎哈嘉瑜伽在發展,那些人不斷在令其他人獲得自覺,就好像只有已經點亮的蠟燭,才能燃點起另一支蠟燭一樣。所以這時代真正算得上是全世界得到光明啟發(enlightenment)的時代。這並非一種人為、虛假的信仰,這轉化必須由你內在的真我自己去進行。

今天是第一天,我希望大家先向我發問。首先我要說明,今天我所講的,你們不能盲目地相信。你必須像個科學家那樣開放的思想,自己去判斷這個假設。如果假設給證實,那麼作為誠實的人,你就要接受它,因為那不只是為了你們的好處。正如這麥克風,若不是接上了總機,它就沒有甚麼意思,同樣,若我們不是連接上了生命的大源,我們的生命就沒有甚麼意義了。

所以佛陀曾說,你要「皈依佛」「佛」的意思是覺醒、開悟(enlightenment),但那不是指一個思維概念,而是一個狀態。另方面,他又說要皈依「法」,法(正法dharma),是存在於我們內裡的,就像我們內在的十個原子價(valency)一樣。你可以屬於任何宗教,基督教、印度教、回教,卻可以作出任何罪來。人類可以有任何種族,但都是一樣的,因為他們都沒有內在得到喚醒的「正法」。那就是要「皈依法」的意思了。佛陀又說要「皈依僧」,「僧」的意思就是「集體」,當你得到自覺之後,你就成為了整體的一部分。這不是一個證書,你可以藉中央神經系統,從指掌上感應得到。亦可感到你自己,和他人的能量中心狀況。若你懂得怎樣去糾正那些能量中心,你就可以醫治自己和其他人了。你就可以在精神、肉身的醫治上面,去幫助別人了。但最重要的,卻是在為他人流露出靈性的喜樂。

明天我會講述靈體的性質,和潛伏在三角骨,或叫聖骨內的靈量(Kundalini)。但今天我希望你們問一些合適的問題。

問:Sahaja Yoga(霎哈嘉瑜伽)這名詞怎解?

答:霎哈嘉(Sahaja)的意思是與生俱來,你是與生俱來有這權利去達至瑜伽(Yoga)。瑜伽的意思是「與上天的力量合一」。簡單地說,Sahaja的意思是「自然而然」,即如生命過程一樣。

問:可否用兩天就學會這技術?

答:不必多久,不必多久。「覺醒」(awakening)不必多久,但你要完全鞏固自己,有些人只用上幾天,有些人約一個月就可做到。但你不必付錢,你卻必須對生命有價值觀。而且,你是不能被勉強的。你必須通過自由意志去渴求。

問:你說的enlightenment(覺醒)是甚麼意思?

答:覺醒的意思是你能用中央神經系統,去感應一切過去進化的成就。就即如狗可走入污穢地方,人就艱難了。原因是進化過程使我們達到有感覺污穢的能力。但得到醒覺後,處於心裡面,本來只是作靜觀的靈(spirit),就開始啟發你的注意力。我告訴過你們,在你們的中央神經系統,你是可以感應他人,和自己的能量中心的狀況的。而且你知道絕對的真理,因為你可以感應到這涼風,任何事情你去問,都有「是」、「否」的答案,像部電腦。假如有個男人裝扮成賽峇峇(Sai Baba),又說自己是聖人,我們怎去判別他是真是偽呢?假如你找來十個已是得自覺的靈的小孩,蒙上他們的眼睛,他們可以立刻回答出,他是真還是假導師。如果一個人在黑暗之中,手裡拿著一條蛇。你告訴他是蛇,他未必會相信,直至給蛇咬為止。但即使那裡只有少許光,他也會把蛇拋掉。我見過有霎哈嘉瑜伽練習者,一夜之間戒除毒癮和惡習。那時,你知道絕對真理,你了解自己和他人,你的注意力變得十分純潔。純潔得連一個眼神,都能創造奇蹟。眼神內亦再沒有貪婪,你變成一個聖人。你過普通人的生活,你變得極為有活力,但你亦十分有愛心。要描述下去就要講一堂課,所以最好先自己去親身經驗這個無所不在的力量。還有其他問題嗎?

 That’s good. I think if you all sit on one side, it will be a better idea. All of you. One should not feel...I think that people are a little upset because of a few people, but one should not be upset because, in the beginning, it's always so. See there is no end to knowledge and I must have given thousands and thousands of lectures only in the English language. But when you come to this hall, I had just to tell you that you put on the one switch and all light is coming. But it is all built-in within you; the system is all built-in just like as if this is built-in. So if I go on telling about the history of electricity, how it came to Bangkok, it is quite boring. Best thing would be to get the experience. Now, there are three conditions for our ascent. First one is that you have to forget the past and not to feel guilty at all. People might have told you that it's a sin and all those things that you are sinners, so don't believe that. After all, you are human beings. You are not gods. You are the only ones who can make mistakes. So please, do not feel guilty. Now if you feel guilty then the centre here, on the left-hand side, catches very badly. It's a very dangerous thing also because it gives you diseases like angina and all the diseases which are caused by lethargic organs. Moreover, spondylitis is another disease you can get with this feeling guilty. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Most of the people say it is very difficult to forgive; but whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you torture yourself and play into the wrong hands. That means you live with a myth. So, in general, you have to forgive, it means don't think of each and every person, just say I forgive everyone. You feel much lighter immediately. Then the third condition is that you all have to be extremely self-confident. You are not to doubt yourself. You are all capable of getting Self-realization. So, please don't be diffident, don't count your mistakes. Now you feel guilty and forgive everyone in general. This will help us a lot to raise the Kundalini. If you do not forgive then the centre on the optic chiasma is like this, very tight and it won't open; it has to open out like that; otherwise, the Kundalini won't rise. So, all your life you tortured yourself, now at least at this time you should forgive everyone. I mean to say you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Because you do not know what Glory awaits you. You will only know your meaning and your greatness once you get your Self-realization. 

All right, now very simple things we have to do; [Yogi's name/UNCLEAR], can you come here, please? You can show them, come along. Now, he will show you how we are going to nourish our centres ourselves. 
First, you see that, and then we will have to close our eyes; it will take hardly 10 minutes altogether. I'd be happy if you could take out your shoes because this mother Earth helps us a lot. And both the feet have to be apart from each other because these are two powers which work within us. Please, keep the shoes behind, it would be better. Now, please put both your feet away from each other. Left side is the power of Desire; the right side is the power of Action. So you please put your left hand like this on your lap very comfortably. You have to sit comfortably, not bending too much or bending backwards, but you are comfortable. The left hand towards me like this suggests that it is your desire to have Self-realization; it's symbolic. The right hand we will use for nourishing our centres on the left-hand side. All right; so now -he will show you also, you can have a look- put your right hand on your heart. On your heart. Here resides the Spirit; but the seed of the Spirit is in the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in our childhood. Then we take our right hand on the upper portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your master. This is created by great incarnations of great masters, like prophets. Now, this right hand you have to take it in the low portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. This is the centre of pure knowledge. Pure knowledge is that which manifests on your central nervous system. This is what Buddha is. From where the word Buddha has come. That means it is not mental, but you feel it on the central nervous system; also from Vidyâ, Vidyâ is meaning the same thing. Now, raise your right hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard with your fingers. Again, raise your hand on your heart. Now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And turn your head to your right, fully. I've already told you that this centre is in jeopardy when you feel guilty. Please do not feel guilty about anything. Now put your right hand on your forehead across and now put down your head. This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness, you have to forgive everyone. Forgive everyone in general. Now you have to take your hand back on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading power, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. Now the last centre, which is important: stretch your hand palm fully, bend your head down and put the centre of your palm exactly on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now press it hard, push back your fingers; important is to push back your fingers so there's good pressure. Good pressure on your scalp; now please move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise, slowly seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do. There's one thing you have to bend your head, that's better. Then you can pressurize it better. And don't move the hand, move the scalp, please. All right, that's very simple now. 

Now, we close our eyes; you may take out your spectacles. If there's something tight on your neck or on your waist, you can loosen it a little bit. Close your eyes please; keep both the feet away from each other and left hand towards me. Now please put your right hand on your heart; nowhere you have to ask a question to me. You may call me Sri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like. Now ask a very fundamental question: "Mother, am I the Spirit?". Ask this question three times. Please ask this question three times. Now if you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your master. So now please take down your hand on the left-hand side in the upper portion of your abdomen. And here you ask a question again three times: "Mother, am I my own master?". Ask this question three times. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and as you have to attain the complete freedom, I have to respect your freedom. So I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here, you asked six times because this centre has six petals: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge". Say it six times. As you start asking for pure knowledge, this Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the upper centres with our self-confidence. So please now raise your right hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. And here you have to say with full confidence ten times: "Mother, I am my own master". I have already told you that the truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not your conditioning, your ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand on your heart and here with full confidence say twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit". This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss. It is the ocean of Joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you commit, this ocean of forgiveness is very powerful and he can dissolve all of them. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And now put your head towards the right, fully. Here you have to say again with full confidence, 16 times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all". I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. It is a myth that we do not forgive and as a result, we torture ourselves and play into wrong hands. So now please raise your right hand on your forehead across; and please fully put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general". Please send your head, please bend it. I forgive everyone in general, please is very important. Say from your heart. Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and hold it tight. Push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say from your heart again, not how many times: "O Divine power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me". Please put your hand on the back side of your head, push back your head. Now, the last centre; now stretch your palm, put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone. Now again I cannot cross over your freedom. I respect it and I cannot force Self-realization on you; you have to ask for it. So now press your scalp fully and move it seven times slowly saying "Mother, please give me Self-realization". Bend your head. Move your skull clockwise with full pressure.

Now take down your hands please; please put both your hands towards me like that and watch me without thinking; now put your right hand like this and bend your head and see with the left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now don't put your hand on top of your head, please; away from it, some people get much further. You might get also a hot breeze, it doesn't matter because you are not forgiven. Now please put your left hand towards me and now bend again your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of...now do not doubt...maybe hot breeze. Now please put your right hand towards me; again bend your head and see for yourself again if there's a cool breeze coming up. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this and fully bend back and ask a question three times: Mother, is this the power of God's Love? Other: is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost; Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Now please bring down your hands, please. All those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze out of your head or on your fingertips and hands, please raise both your hands; both your hands, please. It's good. May God bless you. You all felt it? Then, good. 
Tomorrow again those who have not felt it will feel it tomorrow and I'll meet all of you individually. Also, you can telephone to your friends and ask them to come. Isn't it? And or maybe they are feeling guilty? So tomorrow it will work out. I am sure it will. Thank you very much. Hope to see you tomorrow with all your friends, and I hope to be here very early. And I'll explain to you everything. (The white skin doesn't get it). There, they all got it. Good, we hope to see you tomorrow again and get more friends. Now you should not discuss around you because this is beyond mind. You can't think about it. If you start thinking you lose again the vibrations. So thank you very much. It's a very good beginning. 

Yogini: You will give us course?
Sri Mataji: Yes.
Yogini: When?
Sri Mataji: Tomorrow. We'll be having a follow-on here later on. Tomorrow, I'll tell you all about this, everything, and then they will have a follow-on. I will tell you everything. All right, tomorrow; and also we are having here some people who are staying over there come all the way from Switzerland and they want to have a follow-on program.
Yogini: [UNCLEAR] We are very late.
Sri Mataji: What happened is that today there was some sort of flooding on the way and for this, we were stuck at the airport. Do you come from what part of India?
Yogini: I live here for 20 years. I'm Jaïn. 
Sri Mataji: Jaïn is the thing I'm teaching you. What Parshwanath has done, you see. Jaïn is to know.
Yogini: Yes, I know.
Sri Mataji: So now this is what it is you have to have, all right? All right; May God bless you. I'm very happy. 

A yogini, leading another yogini to Sri Mataji: She has a problem in the back.
