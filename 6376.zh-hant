俄國聖彼得堡霎哈嘉瑜伽醫學會議

1995年9月20日

〔是次會議由Petrovskaya俄國科學及文學研究院主辦,錫呂‧瑪塔吉女士是該研究院唯一的女性名譽會員。〕

錫呂‧瑪塔吉女士:我向所有從心中追求平安的人致敬,如果人們只是表面的追求和平,那我也沒有辦法。但我們看見這些戰爭為我們的國家及有關的國家帶來如此災難,我們便應該認真的思考一下和平。

我不反對任何宗教。所有宗教來到世上,都是同一棵靈性樹上的花朵。但人們摘下那些花朵,然後為那些死去的花朵而爭鬥,說..「這是我的,這是我的。」在第二次世界大戰以後,開始了一種以神的名義發動的新型戰爭。如果你相信只有一個神,怎可能去戰鬥?因此他們所有的只是一種思想上的理念,而不是在心中有真正的信心。沒有宗教教導仇恨,但現實卻往往相反。據我所知,在開始時所有宗教都是以最純潔的形式來到世上,希望為這個世界帶來愛心、平安和團結。但漸漸有些人「執掌」了這些宗教。開始時他們也是好好的,但漸漸地他們各自分開。不僅宗教之間分崩離析,甚至在每一宗教內部,也分成許多不同的派別。無論他們實際怎樣,但至少他們在人間創造了一種道德感。他們談道德,也談愛心與慈悲。他們成立了許多機構,來鼓吹這種想法,但都只是表面的。你們看那些自稱為基督徒、回教徒相印度教徒的人,他們是真的嗎?他們是真正的基督徒嗎?耶穌基督說:「你們不要有淫邪的眼睛。」你們見過基督徒沒有或從沒有淫邪的眼睛的嗎?穆罕默德說:「除非你知道自己的真我,否則你不能知道神。」真我(Self)的意思是永恆的靈(Spirit)。他們有多少人曾經嘗試追尋?所有這些回教徒,他們是否有嘗試追求靈性。他們只是在鬥爭,到處鬥爭。我很為他們難過,因為成千上萬的人、就這樣被殺掉。他們被推動去戰爭,被鼓勵去戰爭,許多都愚蠢地死去,他們被徹底的屠殺。

我問一個俄國人:「為甚麼你們有車臣的戰爭?」他說:「我們是一個民主國家,在一個民主國家裡,怎可能有一個邦是建立在宗教之上的呢?」聽起來合情合理,十分合乎邏輯。但你們知道英國也只有一個宗教嗎?那便是英國的聖公會。據說天主教的大女兒是法國,而在西班牙,除了天主教會外,別無其地。而在這裡,除了正統教會以外,就沒有其他。無論他們做了多少好事,都給他們的所作所為扯平了,因為他們都不跟從宗教所要求的那樣做。

如果你想知道那些回教徒是怎樣的,問那些猶太教教徒吧。如果你想知道那些猶太教教徒是怎樣的,問那些基督徒吧。如果你想知道那些基督徒是怎樣的,你最好到美洲去,看看他們曾經做過些甚麼。那些基督徒是公然地極之不道德的人。今天我偶然看見一段俄國的電影,比美國電影還要壞。片中有個近乎全裸的女郎,就好像美國的女孩子一樣,不知羞恥,完全沒有道德。耶穌基督有教人不道德嗎?祂有談到娼妓嗎?在西方,甚至連家庭主婦也表現得像娼妓一樣,這是我親眼看見的,她們完全不尊重自己的貞潔。現在所有那些美國的破爛貨都到了這裏來,因為他們在本土賣不出去,而你們則不假思索便買下那些破爛貨。你們被吸引到西方那種不道德的生活方式,你們如何作基督徒?

回教徒也一樣,他們宣稱回教是一個偉大的,教導道德的宗教。穆罕默德甚至有談到基督和他母親的貞潔。但如果你看那些回教徒,他們有時比基督徒更壞。有一次我從印度維也特(Riyadh)到倫敦去,途中睡著了。我醒來的時候,發現本來穿著亞拉伯服飾的男女,都換了新鮮時尚的衣服。那些無恥的女子穿著可恥的衣服,像個美國女郎,而那些男子也穿上可怕的服裝,像個小丑。他們都飲酒、抽煙,在飛機上大跳的士高舞。於是我問那位戴著面紗的空中小姐:「飛機中途有停過站嗎?」她說:「沒有。」於是我說:「他們是同一班人嗎?為甚麼會變成這樣?」他們說:「你到倫敦去看看,便曾明白。」他們飲酒,比蘇格蘭人還厲害。由於我丈夫的工作,我們經常參加派對,我丈夫從不飲酒,他們便稱他為「回教徒」,其他人則飲酒如故。

基督教失敗了、回教失敗了,這是毫無疑問的。用勉強的方法,不可能帶來道德。這是我所看見的。我碰見過一些英國人,我問他們說:「為甚麼你們經常這樣看女人?」他們說:「我們很享受。」我說:「那耶穌基督呢?」他們說:「我們甚至在教堂也這樣做。我們要將眼睛固定在某物之上嗎?」我說:「那是可以辦到的。你們都不是基督徒,不是回教徒,不是猶太教徒。你們都是些沒有希望的壞蛋。」他們說:「母親,我們應該怎麼辦?」:我問他們說:「你們是真理的追求者嗎?抑或你們只想依循你們那些舊有的固定觀念,抱著某些東西不放,然後認為我們是基督徒,我們已經得救,我們是回教徒,我們已經得救,我們是猶太教徒,我們已經得救。坦白說,你們大多數人都會落入地獄。他們說:「為甚麼?」我說:「因為你們都是些偽君子。現實上你們從不追隨自己的宗教,你們只是戴著一些標簽。」

我曾經看人們在基督教的教堂打架,在回教的聖殿打架,在猶太教的聖堂打架。試想從亞伯拉罕到摩西,從摩西到耶穌基督,然後到穆罕默德,這是一步一步前進的過程。甚至回教徒的戒律也不是屬於他們的,因為它不是來自可蘭經,而是來自聖經,在耶利米書,摩西頒佈給猶太人的。但猶太人說不,我們不會接受,那是太多了。然後那些基督徒說,不,我們也不能接受。但那些回教徒說可以,我們可以接受。由此可見摩西時代的猶太人是如何徹底的腐敗。但接受了這些,對任何人有幫助嗎?如果他們相信一個抽象無形的神,尤其是那些回教徒,為甚麼他們要為任何國家或土地而爭鬥?神是無所不在的。有一點很重要,在任何國家,如俄國,任何人,你要先知道自己是俄國人,如果有誰先想自己是回教徒或基督教徒,他們便會鬥爭。因為他們都運用政治的頭腦,而不是靈性上的頭腦。你們要有靈性上的頭腦,否則你要承認你不相信神。如果你相信神,便應該有靈性上的取向。我所見過的也許比你們為多。

現在爭論的雙方是西方文化和原教旨主義(fundamentalist)的文化。原教旨主義者認為應該有很嚴厲的文化。他們使用強逼的辦法。在阿爾及利亞,成千上萬的人只因穿著像個西方人而被殺。那些原教旨主義者在巴黎放置炸彈,他們參予各種暴力活動。穆罕默德有談到”rohem”,”rohamad”(愛心),但在回教徒之中卻沒有平等,他們都不善待女性。婦女往往生下八個到十個孩子,然後被丈夫拋棄,成為棄婦。在印度我們有數以千計這樣的婦女和兒童,他們成為國家中最貧窮的一群。穆罕默德說:「你們可以和四個女子結婚,好使她們不變成娼妓。那是當時的情況。但現在他們大多變成妓女,她們怎樣生活下去呢?他們要以伊斯蘭的名義捱飢受凍嗎?還要殺害他們的孩子嗎?

基督教、回教和猶太教,他們做過甚麼好事?我認識一些執掌宗教的人,他們已盡了努力做到最好,但他們必須面對事實。他們並沒有達到耶穌基督、穆罕默德或摩西所要求的。相反因為他們的盲目,他們為那些偉大的宗教的開創人帶來壞名聲,那些偉大的宗教本來是由同一棵靈性之樹而來的。

你們都知道,今時今日,美國成為領導者,因為金錢已經成為了上帝。於是美國的文化成為上帝的文化。他們正在剝削你們的國家,但你們卻不知道,你們都不明白。我在你們電視上看見那些舶來品的廣告,你們瘋了嗎?你們所有的錢都用來買那些破爛貨,那些貨物在西方任何一處或美國都是賣不出的。你們那些飽學之士都到西方去洗碗碟。完全沒有一點愛國心和犧牲精神。在我的國家,我感到自豪的說,你甚至無法買到一條入口的領帶,那是甘地先生的功勞。他說:「不要買任何外國貨,你可以買手織的布,比較粗,但不要緊。」我父母為國家犧牲一切,因為他們有愛國心。我也是個愛國的人,我希望你們也這樣做。只有通過霎哈嘉瑜伽,才有可能做到。不是靠宣稱我是回教徒,我是基督徒,不是這樣的。你們要首先說你們是俄國人。你們可以走自己喜歡的道路,但首先要知道自己希望得到甚麼。

還有一樣事物是充滿罪惡和非法的,卻被接受,那便是瑞士銀行。沒有人有甚麼批評,他們接受它的存在。我們國家四分之三的錢是鎖在裡面的,我不知道有多少俄國的黑手黨和其他國家的黑手黨在裡面活動。你們必須用合法的力量攻擊他們,因為他們是不合法的。那些錢本來是要給那些貧窮、有病和患了痲瘋病的病人的。他們把錢都存進瑞士銀行去。我在聯合國婦女大會發言時曾呼籲群起攻擊瑞士銀行,它並沒有合法權利存在。

我舉我的國家為例,印度是個潛力很大的國家,但三百年來,英國人沒有任何入境證便前來,並且定居。他們大肆掠奪,目前的情況是,如果有個印度人要到英國去,他們會仔細檢查他。他們奪去我們所有的黃金、鑽石、銀器和所有有價值的東西,就好像強盜一樣。他們自稱為基督徒,那也罷了,他們離去時還製造出回教徒和印度人(不單只是印度教徒,因為還有佛教徒、耆那教徒及其他人等之間的問題。那些回教徒說要有他們自己的土地,一如往常那樣。他們太執著於土地,回教徒都十分執著,我也不知道為甚麼。因此他們奪去了巴基斯坦和孟加拉。孟加拉是全世界最貧窮的國家,甚至比烏克蘭還要壞得多。現在那些人都偷渡回印度,他們都通過某些方法回到印度。但中國卻給予巴基斯坦武器來攻打我們。巴基斯坦的情況是更壞的,因為那些離開印度到巴基斯坦的人,原以為有高官厚祿等著他們,但實際發生的是他們被視為奴隸。印度人是很聰明很狡滑的,巴基斯坦的人發現他們附近有個叫Karachi的港口非常重要。於是他們說要得到這片土地,因為他們在該處已是多數。在一次訪問中,那位帶頭的領袖說,印度的總理就好像希特勒,她每天要殺十四至十六人來減少他們的多數。因此現在是回教徒與回教徒戰爭。侯賽因和有錢的回教國家戰爭。庫爾德族人和土耳其人戰爭。這就是回教嗎?這就是他們敬奉穆罕默德的方式?那是因為他們沒有找到自己的真我,他們還沒有知道神。

霎哈嘉瑜伽是唯一可以令你得到自覺(Self-Realization),得到對真我的知識(Slf-Knowledge)的方法。我們有人來自不同宗教、不同的種族,他們許多到過不同的假導師那裡去。他們全部都說霎哈嘉瑜伽是唯一可以令他們得到平安的方法。如果你內在沒有平安,你怎能將平安給予別人?有些得過和平獎的人脾氣很大,十分可怕。他們從來不笑,就好像後面有支鎗指著他們那樣。他們也很緊張,這樣他們如何將平安給予別人呢?因此第一樣要做到的是,必須在內在建立平安。我過去二十五年便是做這樣的工作。你不僅得到平安,還可以得到天國的戶籍。我上次來俄國時正值政變,但我看見那些霎哈嘉瑜伽的修習者卻絕對的平安。我問其中一個說:「你不擔心周圍所發生的事嗎?他們說:「母親,我們已在天國之中,為甚麼還要擔心呢?世上的政府常有改換,但我們已經進入了永恆的生命。」你可以從他們的臉上看出,他們沒有半點虛偽。

唯有霎哈嘉瑜伽可以給你絕對的知識,而不是相對的知識。相對的知識就好像說:我是個基督徒,因此我高於回教徒,或者說我是個回教徒,因此我高於基督徒。你們看見嗎?這是互相競爭的。那是一些僵化的觀念,因為你生長在回教家庭,又或者你生長在基督教家庭,這些都是僵化的觀念。希特勒便是這方面的表表者。他說他們是一個優秀的種族,真的是一個優秀的種族嗎?他們用毒氣殺害兒童,而且樂此不疲,他們怎可能是個優秀的種族呢?我們認為比較優秀的是充滿慈悲與愛心的聖人。由於我們有頑固的思想在腦袋中,因此我們沒有自由,沒有勇氣去超越那些桎梏我們的思想。同時人類的能量是有限的,思想的能量也是有限的。

如果我說有一個無所不能的能量,為甚麼我們不嘗試得到它?為甚麼我們老是認為自己是基督徒、回教徒或其他甚麼的,為甚麼我們不追求穆罕默德、耶穌和摩西所描述過的力量?有甚麼傷害呢?如果你能得到甚麼,為甚麼不去得到?而且那是免費的,你毋須付錢。事實上我不需要你們任何東西,我自己已很滿足,我也不需要霎哈嘉瑜伽。但我為甚麼要東奔西跑呢?那是因為在我之中的那種愛、那種慈悲,使我做這一切事情。因為眾人是盲目的,他們不能看見。我不需要有更多的基督教堂,更多的回教寺,更多的猶太教聖殿。我們不需要這類的建築物。但在人心處是他們永恆的靈。在心中我們要創造平安。神創造了整個靈量的系統,不是我。為甚麼神要創造這個系統?是為了最後的突破。靈量是你們每個人的母親,她要發動起來,她就在那裡。這靈量是你們自己的力量。靈量是你們自己的母親。你們有權利去獲得自覺。你們有完全的權利與上天的力量合一,使這個力量流通於你。我們都有這個機制,假如神將我們造成一些工具,但我們卻不願連接至總機去,那你們會變成甚麼呢?你們還有甚麼去認同呢?我們為甚麼要生在世上呢?

現在談到科學,科學有它的限制。無論他們發現甚麼都是科學的範圍,但他們能說明為甚麼人要生在世上嗎?他們能說明進化為甚麼會發生嗎?他們能說明人類的目的嗎?許多問題他們都不能回答。例如你問那些醫生,誰使我們的心臟跳動?他們會說是自動神經系統。但這自動者是誰呢?他們就沒有答案。我們身體內有acetylcholine和腎上腺。這兩種化學物,一增加,一放緩,一增加,一減少。但在身體內,則顯得隨意,沒有人知道為甚麼。那些化學物增加、收緊、放鬆,為甚麼?他們能夠解釋嗎?我們知道身體會排斥外來的東西,但當胚胎形成時,卻不會被排斥。身體會保留它、養育它,直到適當的時間才把它分娩出來。誰去作出這種分辨呢?那些醫生能回答這些問題嗎?我們不能說明生命的目的。現在這些科學每天都有新的假設、新的發現。科學家之間競爭得很劇烈。他們互相競爭,但結果造出甚麼來呢?是原子彈、氫氣彈。因為科學是不談道德的。科學家都沒有道德。他們可以成為間諜,他們可以殺人。他們是科學家,但也可以是醉酒漢,可以是犯了奸淫的人,就好像那些教士一樣,毫無分別。他們受到高度尊祟,但卻出了甚麼問題?他們得過許多獎狀,但你卻發現他們在道德上很低。這是因為他們不尊重自己。他們不尊重自己是因為他們不知道自己是甚麼。他們不知道自己的偉大。這是所有人類的問題,他們不知道自己是誰。我們不是這個身體、這個思維,我們不是這個頭腦和情緒。我們不是這個自我、宗教的制約或其他甚麼,我們都是純潔的靈。

我現在要告訴你們,成為純潔的靈之後會怎樣。我想沒有人會反對,因為這是為了你們的好處,為了你們家庭的好處,為了你們國家的好處,也是為了全世界的好處。因此請仔細的聽我說。我們內在都有這個靈性的力量(Kundalini)。這是印度很古老的科學。在古蘭經稱為阿薩斯(Asas)。聖經說:「我將如火舌般在你面前顯現。」真實是你們必須自己經驗的,你們不必對我有盲目的信心。盲目的信仰已引起夠多的問題。你們要去經驗它,經驗這個靈量昇起並穿透你們的頭蓋骨。於是你們便連接到無所不在的,上天浩愛的力量去。這不是演講,不是傳道,這是真正實現你的洗禮。

如果你是聰明的,你會明白我們不是生活在一個很和平的世界。得到自覺後,第一樣發生在你身上的是你進入無思無慮的覺醒狀態。當我們思考時,我們不是想著將來,便是過去,無法處於現在。現在才是真實。過去已經完結,將來並不存在。可是我們卻不能處於現在,這是個事實。一個思潮昇起,然後降下,另一個思潮昇起,然後降下,而我們則處於過去和現在這些思潮起伏中間。但當靈量昇起以後,她拉開了這些思想,在中間創造了一個空隙,那便是當下此刻,在當下此刻,你沒有了那種反射的思維,你得到徹底的平安。你是有知覺的,絕對有知覺,但你沒有思想。心理學家容格也談過一點點,我不能稱他是個全面的霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者,但他確曾反對那個可怕的佛洛依德。得到自覺以後,你變得絕對的平安。當你連接上這個無所不在的力量,它是完全平安的,完全沒有衝突,喜樂便開始流進你的心,而你向周圍散播平安。你使他人獲得平安,你會拋棄那些不是真實的觀念。你知道了一件事:神是平安的泉源。這樣你才能散播平安。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你會在成千上萬坐在一起的人中間找到這種平安。他們可以屬於任何國家,可以屬於任何種族,但當他們在一起時,就好像一個海洋一樣。這不是憑空想像,因為你們變成是整體的一個部分,滴水變成了汪洋。他們互相欣賞,他們從不爭鬥,因為他們都是純潔的靈。

另一樣發生在你身上的好事,是你的注意力變得受到啟發。你們可能全都比我年輕,今年我七十三,快七十四歲了。大多數到了這個年紀的人都會變得精神疲弱,因為他們的注意力變得如此。要改變他們也很困難。但你們的注意力會受到啟發。通過受啟發的注意力,首先你會看見萬物的一體。而且你的注意力會受到愛和慈悲的啟發,你會看見他人的好處,而且樂意幫助那些需要你幫助的人。我必須告訴你們我初來俄國的經驗,我不懂得俄國任何一種語言,誰來幫助我呢?是德國人,是二十五個德國人,那些德國的霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者初次來幫助我時,眼淚從他們的眼睛流出來。我說:「你們怎樣來到這裡?」他們說:「母親,德國人曾殺過那麼多俄國人,殺了那麼多人,我們不是有責任來到這裡嗎?」你們看這種愛心,只有你成為純潔的靈才有可能。這不是一場演講,或是傳道。

第二樣發生在你注意力之上的是,你的注意力給你正確的途徑。一夜之間,許多人拋棄了毒品、酒精和各種毀滅性的事物。通過霎哈嘉瑜伽,你能享受一切而不會自我毀滅。你享受自然界的一切,你享受所有人。你享受所有內在的宗教,我再次強調,是內在的,而不是表面的。所有這些你都可以得到,是屬於你自己的,你應該要去得到。

這個注意力是很有力量的。昨天他們對我說:「母親,列寧格勒將會很冷很冷。」我告訴那些霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者說:「儘管運用你們的注意力,太陽會為你們服務。」結果昨天陽光普照。你們可以命令大自然這樣做,整個自然界都在你們蓮足之下,因為你們已經與上天的力量合一。這個上天的力量創造了季節,創造了一切。這個力量創造了你,這個力量創造了你們全體。有甚麼對你好的,這個力量都會為你去做,不會做對你不好的事。當然,如果你想某人應該死掉,這個力量不會幫你,但在得到自覺,成為純潔的靈以後,你也不會想那些壞事情。

另一樣十分重要發生在你們身上的是,無論你將注意力放在甚麼人身上,你甚至可以給他們自覺。就好像一枝點亮了的蠟燭,可以點亮其他許多成千上萬的蠟燭一樣。我還沒有到過非洲,但在南非喀墨隆及其他許多地方,已經有許多霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者。我還沒有到過西伯利亞,但那裡已經有許多霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者。

現在霎哈嘉瑜伽正在傳播,那些反對它的人很快會離開。人們會知道他們是偽君子,我們不必擔心,他們會自動地暴露出來。我們不要對任何人有偏見,我們不要咒詛任何人。我們不要殺害任何人,霎哈嘉修習者不要殺害任何人。在巴西那裡的人告訴我,霎哈嘉瑜伽練習者都極之誠實。

跟著你會開始將自覺給予別人...另一階段是無疑惑的知覺狀態。你對霎哈嘉瑜伽沒有懷疑,對我沒有懷疑,對霎哈嘉瑜伽的運作沒有懷疑,對自己沒有懷疑。你們都要達到那個階段。你們國家有許多已經達到那個階段。在西方人或者白皮膚的人當中,俄國人對靈性是最敏感的。他們不像那些美國人,我發現那些美國人都是十分愚蠢的。我的意思是你們不可能明白他們,他們真的十分愚蠢。

我給你們舉個例子,有個容格學會的主席,他至少大我二十年。那時我差不多六十歲。我告訴他們容格犯了甚麼錯誤,他們都認為很對。這位主席來見我,拿著手杖不斷抖顫。他說:「我有個私人的問題。」我說:「有甚麼問題?」他說:「我是個天主教徒,有一個情婦。由於我是天主教徒,我不能跟她結婚,也不能離婚。」他說:「天主教徒不能有情婦,也不能離婚。」他也沒有將事情告訴現在已經死去的太太。現在他很希望跟那位情婦結婚。我問他:「那你的情婦多大哪?」他說:「只有三十五歲。」我十分震驚,她的年紀當得他的孫女。我說:「那你想我怎樣幫你忙呢?」他說:「你最好能在她心中放入一種感覺,讓她認為應該要嫁給我,這個年紀八十,混身抖顫的老先生竟然向我要求這樣的祝福。我對他說:「先生,對不起,我不能為你這樣做。」他是國際容格學曾的主席,卻要求這樣愚蠢的事情。因此有甚麼老人要見我,我都說不,對不起。年青人比較好些,因為那些老人家腦袋裡還有許多愚蠢的念頭,他們想我幫他們做那些愚蠢的事。我告訴你們,如果他們到耶穌基督那裡去,耶穌基督肯定曾狠狠教訓他們,如果他們到穆罕默德那裡去,穆罕默德也會教訓他們。這些愚蠢的人想要統冶全世界,如何可能呢?

你們俄羅斯人都是有智慧的人。你們有偉大的傳統。印度一直以來沒有侵略過其他國家。成吉思汗來到侵略我們,我們飽受侵略。但在靈性上印度人所知很多,他們知道靈量(kundalini)。他們沒有追求物質,他們希望得到解脫(Moksha),得到自覺。當然我們也有一些壞分子,但人人都清楚他們是甚麼。我十分尊重俄羅斯人,並愛他們。因為他們從來沒有聽過靈量,他們如何能這樣即時接受呢?在他們裡面所追求的是甚麼?對這微妙的東西懷有甚麼愛和暸解?世上很少人像你們這樣。

現在是最後的審判,那些人要錯失的,始終也會錯失。耶穌基督曾說:「你們呼我基督,基督,但我不會承認你們。」要明白你們要成為永恆的靈,正如基督所說:「你們要得到重生。」你們才能對我有信心,或沒有信心。這並不要緊。首先你們要對自己的真我有信心,當你在靈性上昇進以後,便會更好。我不會告訴你們我是誰。我絕不會告訴你們我是誰。耶穌基督是神的兒子,你們可能會否認,但他確實是。但當耶穌基督這樣說時,那些愚蠢的人便把他釘上十字架,因此我不會告訴你們我是誰,當然我不是個普通人。無論我是甚麼,我就是我,對我毫無分別。但我不會告訴你們。你們先要在靈性上昇進,才能知道,才能明白。為甚麼?因為你們要為他人的好處著想:由於你們的無知,你們可能會妨礙其他人的進步。這是一項多大的責任,你們要肩負多麼美麗的責任。

最後你們進入上帝的國,沉浸在喜樂的海洋之中。喜樂並沒有二重性,像快樂或不快樂,喜樂是一元的。你拋棄了你的慾念與貪婪,變得無所執著,並且開始看見自己的真我。你們不必成為苦行僧;你們不必到喜瑪拉雅山去,你們不必禁食。這是內在的,在外面沒有甚麼需要改變。我知道很快會有一個全球性的改變。甚至你們的遺傳基因庫也開始改變了。各式各樣的人都來到霎哈嘉瑜伽,得到改變。有許多人的病都被治好了,連那些不治之症,不用付錢也被治好了,而且是通過他們自己的力量,一切都是很容易的,自然而然的。甚至給那些動物也可以,如果你將能量給予那些植物,它們會長得好十倍。因此在這最後審判的日子,一種新的人類會被創造。這是屬於你自己的,這是你自己的力量。你不僅知道知己的光榮,你自己的偉大。你變得絕對自由,因為你得到那最高的智慧。在靈性之光下,你知道甚麼是對你好,你知道絕對的知識。

在這次短短的演講,有許多事情不能告訴你們。有一件事我想請求那些執掌宗教的人,他們已將人類帶到一定的高度,他們已通過不同的階段,但這是為了甚麼呢?為甚麼要有宗教呢?那是為了人類的昇進,他們必須向上昇進,要有宗教來建立那種平衡。就好像飛機要進入不同的工場修理,才得到平衡,然後才能起飛。如果只是平衡卻不起飛,那有甚麼用?因此你們都要起飛。純潔的靈是自由的,你不必說不要這樣,不要那樣。你們都要起飛,享受完全的自由。在這次短短的演講,無論我說甚麼都是從心而發的。所有人都認為霎哈嘉瑜伽在這個國家的發展是個奇蹟。霎哈嘉瑜伽解決了他們各種各樣的問題,甚至是物質的問題。

願神祝福你們。

What about asking the questions?

[speaks aside]

I’m also a communist.

[Question: “Are you the Holy Spirit?”]

Write it down and give it Me please.

[.Are you Holy Spirit...?]

Now, I’ve already told you that I’m not going to say anything about it. I’ve already told. Now, if I say, why should you believe – blind faith? After Realization you’ll know everything. I don’t want to get crucified.

[aside]

You see, let them discover, it’s the point. You can not force anything. Only thing you have to be honest people.

[aside]

Thank you, thank you very much.

[aside]

There was one question, “What is the purpose of human life?” The purpose of human life is to enter into the Kingdom of God. Is to enjoy the bounties of God Almighty. The purpose is to become the Spirit so that there is complete peace, harmony and pure joy. That is the role of God also. This another question.

Mr. Roerich [a famous Russian painter who lived in India] went to, definitely he went to this gentleman to get some kind of a Buddhism. He was, himself, a very good man, but I don’t know why he got allurement with this kind of a Buddhism. Is another kind of religion, which has not helped anyone. Buddha has talked about compassion, compassion and compassion. And the Japanese are the greatest Buddhists. So you can see what sense is it. Compassion – Japanese are only doing their business. Buddhism has not entered into their mind. Like any other religion, only after knowing yourself it will happen. We have horrible cults in Japan under the name of Buddha.

I went to Canada and there was one fellow who came in the orange dress and I asked him, “Why are you wearing this orange dress?” So he said that “This is the only dress left now to me. I was a very rich man. All other money, everything is gone to Mr. Dalai Lama.” He’s a great beggar and I was surprised that in the West people like if you beg money from them. In Boston they asked. “Many, how many Rolls Royces I had?” I said, “I have none. I only have one car that my husband has.” So they said, “You are not in the business?” I said, “No.” They said, “We don’t care for you. Get out.” That’s American style. So this Dalai Lama has accumulated so much money. He has come in our country. No one likes him, but he is sitting on our heads. He’s very fond of gold. He tells people, “You take sanyasa. You become ascetic. Give all your money to me”, like all other false gurus.

Buddha has failed, Christ has failed, Mohammed-sahib has failed because people never understood them. They were too great for human mind. So the first thing I did was to study human beings for about forty-seven years of My age and I saw how complicated they were and then I found out this method of en masse Realization. There were many Sufis who got Realization. There were many Saints in India who got Realization, but very, very few. Also, among Christians, there were some who got Realization – Kahlil Gibran. But they were all tortured.

So we have to say now, to understand them also, you have to have your self knowledge. They’re all making money in the name of these great founders of religion or they’re spreading poison. In Mecca there were thousands and thousands of Muslims and there was one fellow from Sudan. He was black, absolutely jet black, and he was spreading poison in the name of Mohammed-sahib. I had somebody close to Me who knew Arabic and I was shocked. And just after that, there was a stampede and thirty-two people, innocent people who had gone for Haj, died in the stampede. You can’t spread a poison in the name of divine people. It is sinful.

Also this gentleman, this painter and his wife, both suffered a lot from physical health.

[“How can achieve good attention?]

You don’t have to do anything because whatever you will do, you’ll do through your mental activity. Mental activity is linear. There’s no truth in it. It goes up to a point, recoils back on it. But the power of Spirit spreads on all sides. [speaks aside] Now they’re asking about attention. It’s very simple, when the Kundalini rises, the attention which is spread out here goes up like this, up. It is brought in the centre. And, at this Sahasrara, it breaks. When it breaks, you see, this whole attention is filled with enlightenment. You don’t have to do anything, but you have to go on raising your Kundalini like this yourself. That’s all. When you watch something, watch something without thinking. Can you watch Me without thinking? Now you can feel the all pervading power in your hands, you’ll see that. This is the namaz, but Muslims don’t know anything. You will feel the cool breeze. This is the all pervading power and on your fingertips you will know about your centers and about the centers of others. All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on their hands or out of their fontanelle bone area raise your hands. So, all of you have felt it. So simple because you are ready and because you’re Russians. May God bless you.

Now we have centers here and we have doctors and we have people here who know how to cure you. You can go to these centers [tell them] and get cured and you can also cure others. One thing I’ve seen, Russians in a huge crowd of sixteen, eighteen thousand people, they told Me they got cured in the program. Only possible in Russia, not even in India. I respect you very much. I don’t know of what metal you are made.

[“There is a central charity Christian Orthodox fund, Shri Mataji. They want to cooperate with Sahaja Yoga.]

Oh, I’m very happy. Now Central Charity Christian Orthodox Fund wants to cooperate with Sahaja Yoga. Thank you very much. Thank you. That’s what I said they are wise. They are very wise people in this country. They will not stand in the way where they see that people are helped. For no rhyme and reason they will object to Sahaja Yoga. Thank you very much. I would like to thank.

[aside]

Some Sahaja Yogini has written to Me. ‘llI go home and read the whole thing and I’ll answer them.... answer them in the program, all right. It’s a very big question.

[“Shri Mataji, do you have a good opinion about Mikhail Gorbachev? What do you think about him now?]

It’s all again political business. I don’t want to say anything about Gorbachev. I think he fell into the trap of these Americans or something. I don’t know what to say. I have all respect for him. But somehow he never wanted to meet Me. I tried. It’s all right.

[“What is the attitude to the husband?”]

The question is there about the women, they want to know my attitude towards the husband.

[“Sorry, Shri Mataji, Moonies” – unclear]

What a question. My goodness. You please don’t ask Me about devils.

[“If each and every person could be a Sahaja Yogi?”]

The question is if each and every person could be a Sahaja Yogi. Yes, of course. But say he’s an idiot. He’s stupid. He has fixed ideas. What else – who’s arrogant. You see if your one foot is in the mouth of the crocodile and put one foot in the boat, what should we do?

[“Shri Mataji, please say how to tell about sects, about false gurus. How we Sahaja Yogis have to talk about sects?”]

Sahaja Yogis have to talk about how they should talk about the false gurus. You see those people who have been to false gurus are already suffering. They could be even quite mad. For example, I went to Chicago and there was one fellow of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna. He was the Chairman of Chicago Hare Rama Hare Krishna. It was very cold and he was wearing the dhoti you know this common in India, very thin. And he had shaved his hair and with a pony tail, a little bit like that coming out. I said, “Sir, I’m a Mother, why are you wearing this dhoti in this cold weather? It’s very cold you know, I’m shivering.” He said, “My guru has told me that if you wear a dhoti, you’ll get moksha, nirvana.” I said, “What? In My country eighty percent wear this thing, so they’d be there already.” He had shaved his hair.

I said, “Why did you shave your hair?” He said, “That my guru has told me that that’s the station to get into the heaven.” He was American, you see. I said, “There is Kabir, a great poet in India, said that by shaving your head if you can get your place in heavens, then what about the sheep that is shaved two times every year. Those sheep must be already there. Where will you have the place?” So he got very angry with Me. “You’re talking against my guru.” I said, “See, you need not be angry with Me. Do what you like, your guru has said, but tomorrow if you get sick with this dhoti don’t come to Me.” This “Hare Rama Hare Krishna” we say everyday in India. We don’t say good morning like the English. We say, “Hare Ram,” just like the Muslims say something, “Allah.” So we say the same way. It’s just a lip service. How can you go to heaven. He got angry but then he developed varicose veins. Next year he came to Me. So, to deal with them, you have to be careful. Firstly, they are slaves of their gurus. They have fixed ideas. Some of them just start shaking before Me. They fall in the ground. But most of them now are finished.

First thing they mesmerize. We have one in India who used to mesmerize and bring out Swiss watches to give to people. Lastly, there were very great people from India went to see him. There were four cameras. He could not mesmerize the camera. So the cameras clearly showed how he brought a necklace and passed it on. And also our rich people in India are so stupid – rich not the poor. They used to go to him to get diamonds, can you imagine. I mean all kinds of tricks he did. But he was exposed by newspapers now. They’re all getting exposed by God’s grace. All falsehood will get exposed. Firstly if you tell them that you don’t have to pay any money to the guru, all the gurus will jump in the sea.

[“Is it possible for people who are not realized to feel the vibrations in your presence?”]

You see those who are not realized can not feel any vibrations, even in My presence.

[Answering a written question:] Then she’s saying that how is it that the people do not accept or recognize that it is You and only You who is the Holy Ghost? They are asking Me again and again the same question. But I must tell you about Russians. First time, when I came to Leningrad nobody had heard about Me. Nobody had seen Me. There were only some advertisements in the newspaper with My face. I also look like Russians sometimes and, you know, they saw only My face in the newspaper and when I went for the program the whole place was filled already, two thousand people and two thousand were waiting outside. I was surprised. I went inside and people got their Realization and when I came out they were still sitting. They said, “Mother, what about us?” I said, “All right, you come tomorrow. We’ll sit outside in the open.” It was very sunny and there were two thousand from outside and two thousand from inside and two thousand more, six thousand people. I was amazed. They all got their Realization. I said, “How did you come to My program?” They were not realized souls. They said, “Mother, Your face, it’s absolutely evident. We know who You are.” I was surprised. That’s why I praise Russians very much. They are sensitive to truth. They are sensitive to spirituality. Maybe last lives they must have done lot of good things. I just don’t know, but I find Russians extremely sensitive.

Another are Romanians, compared to all other Western countries. I’ll tell you a joke. In Tagliatti there was a joke that a Tagliatti fellow asked an American, “How many Sahaj Yogis you have in America?” So he said, “Fifty-six.” He said, “You have Fifty-six thousand. We have only twenty-one thousand in Tagliatti.” We had to hold the meeting in jungles near Volga River, because there were so many. Very sweet, very sweet, very sweet, I don’t know how to express Myself for your love and understanding. Here I talked to scientists. There were two hundred fifty scientists sitting. They said, “Don’t tell us about science. Tell us about God’s science. We have had enough of science.” Just think of it, such beautiful people like the flowers about to become the fruits. No credit for Me. I go to all the countries, sixty-five countries. Among all of them, you are so special. I don’t know, when I leave you I feel somebody is wrenching My Heart. May God bless you.

[“If there are chakras above Sahasrara?”]

There are chakras above Sahasrara, but first of all establish yourself. Gradually everything will work out.

[“What is to be attitude to the members of the family who are not Sahaja Yogis?”]

My family members were not Sahaja Yogis to begin with. My husband used to say, “I know You are a Saint, but You can not transform others. You are moral, but You can’t make others moral.” Now he’s changed. He said, “I’ve seen all this happening. You’ve made them into angels. I have to be honest that You have done the job.” Even now, My daughters, My grandchildren, everyone in My family, husband’s family, My mother’s family, they believe in Sahaja Yoga. But I would say that I showed all compassion, love and patience. But I would say they are not great Sahaja Yogis like Russians, but they will be. Also it’s better to keep them out because Sahaja Yogis make such a fuss out of them which will spoil their chances. They should come to Sahaja Yoga like ordinary people, otherwise it will be like nepotism I don’t want that.

[“Mother, please tell us how to overcome the daily suffering of how making enough money to pay for the food.”]

Now she’s asking how to make sufficient money to have the food. After coming to Sahaja Yoga, many people have solved their financial problems completely. How? First their attention becomes so good, that they can do many things which they could never do before and the blessings of the Divine start pouring on them. You have to have faith in yourself that you are Sahaja Yogis and you’ll be amazed so many things will happen. Such coincidences that you’ll be amazed at yourself.

I give you two examples of a miracle. There was a girl, young girl, who got frustrated because she didn’t do well or something and she shot herself on the stomach on the left hand side and the bullet came out from here from the right arm. Also there was some blood, but she was quite conscious. So they took her to the hospital. Doctors were surprised. They x-rayed her, did everything and found that the bullet did not touch any nerve, any muscle, anything. Doctors said as if the bullet had a stroll around. Nobody could explain it. She came out of hospital second day.

Another miracle, recent, I mean recent one, there was a lady who’s son was in America and who got into a horrible disease which is in her family at a very young age. Normally, they get it in the old age. She was working in the UN. She wrote to Me three letters praying that, “Mother, please cure my son. He’s so young and he’ll die within a month’s time.” And the fourth letter came from her, that he’s all right, nothing is wrong with him. I didn’t do anything – this All Pervading Power.

Another is another Sahaja Yogini in Turkey was thinking that her husband is not well employed in Turkey as a pilot and just out of the blue he got a job in Germany and now in America, a very big job. I don’t do anything. I am the laziest person.

[“What can save Russia?”]

I’ve already told you, you have to be patriotic. This is another revolution. You have to sacrifice and you have to understand not to waste your money on these Western nonsensical things. And Divine help will come to you. So many Sahaja Yogis who dare touch you, you’re all protected by the Divine. What else?

[“Shri Mataji, one of the symbols with Denmark is the elephant. Will Sahaja Yoga be established in Denmark?”]

If they’re asking if Sahaja Yoga will go to Denmark because the symbol is the, what you call, the elephant. Sahaja Yoga in Denmark will move likes elephant only, I think.

[“Will there be other incarnations on the Earth?”]

They’re asking about incarnations, will there be incarnations and all of that. Why do you worry about all these things. I can’t tell you.

[“I want to know about these big problems .... China”

He wants to know about China? You shouldn’t mind if I say that we couldn’t start Sahaja Yoga there in that way because still they’re communists. But I’m sure the government of China will accept it very soon and then we can start Sahaja Yoga in a big way. Chinese are other very ancient people, very wise. Culturally, they are like Indians. They have morality in them. One thing I noticed, they were extremely hospitable, kind and gentle. You saw people there who were from Germany, from Africa, from America. They looked so gross. But Chinese, you know, they had arranged, through their students, the volunteers, very well trained girls and boys and so gentle. They were paid nothing. They are very patriotic people one has to learn from them. I wish Indians were like that. They are very dignified, very well mannered. Of course, if you insult them, they don’t like. I must admit that Indians did that, insult them. And art, what art they have. Their government doesn’t allow much to come inside China. They also don’t care much for the Western culture. They dress up just like Chinese, most of them.

Moreover, they’re very learned. They had two great philosophers, but the greatest was Lao Tze, who talked about Kundalini, Realization, everything. Confucius talked about humanity. So they believe in Confucius because it suits communism. In Hong Kong there are many Chinese and I asked them what will you do when the Hong Kong goes to the China, mainland China? They said, “We are Chinese and we’ll be with mainland China. What does it matter? We’re not going to run away.” And do you know how they became rich? So many Chinese have gone abroad. And after this episode of killing the young students they were angry, but when it was explained that how can you suddenly give freedom to these young boys, students. One can do it gradually.

Otherwise, like Russia, there will be problem of mafia. They are very wise. So the Chinese who are abroad understood and the Chinese abroad send fifty to sixty percent of their income to their government. They are not attached to money. That’s how they have become rich, very dedicated. Thousands and thousands of people are there, but the system that they have built, so beautiful that nobody will start playing. I was amazed that while working nobody drank anything, even a drop, so very alert. But when we were coming by that plane first class all the ladies and men were drinking vodka, vodka, bottles after bottles. I got a headache. Chinese are ashamed to do such a thing. Also they have told Me that the Chinese men marry Russian women and then give it up and call the Chinese women. I tell you, Chinese women are really very sweet. They don’t compete with men. They are very sweet and they win over men with their sweetness. I also know they are very sensitive to spirituality. Even their prime minister asked Me about spirituality when I went with my husband. And I’m sure one day you’ll find your brothers and sister very closely in China.

I hope I’ve been able to answer most of your questions. I thank the organizers of this conference from My Heart.

[“Many questions about how to give up drinking Shri Mataji?”]

When you get your Self-Realization, in the light of Spirit, you give up everything which is destructive. How? I’ll give an example. Supposing I’m very obstinate and I have a snake in my hand and there is darkness and you tell Me there is snake in your hand. I will say, “No, it’s a rope.” But when the light will come, immediately I will throw it away. In the same way, not only you give up drinking, that’s not the only thing you do, but you give up everything that is bad for you. Because you also become very strong and free. Nothing can attack you, no habits. All drop out.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
