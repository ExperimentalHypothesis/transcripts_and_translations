Public Program Day 1 at Audimax University. Vienna (Austria), 12 October 1987.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. The truth is beyond human awareness. Whatever we know about this world, what we see, what we feel, is a very wee bit. The truth is that in your evolutionary process you have not yet touched the Absolute. And the truth has to be absolute. Now you see those plants here, everybody sees the plants and everybody knows it is the plants. But everybody asks Me why there are so many ideologies and philosophies about reality. Reality has to be one and absolute. And is seen, felt by everyone.

Now what you have seen here, what he has told you I would say is the knowledge of the roots. In the West we have grown outside like a tree, but in the East, people had time to find out the roots. As Indians had to learn a lot about science, I think it's important that all of us should know also about the science of the roots. A scientific mind has to be an open mind; it should not be a closed mind, which does not want to see the other side of it. If a hypothesis is put before a scientist, he works it out and if it is proved correct he accepts it as laws. So the hypothesis is first to be listened to, then if it is proved that it is absolutely correct then we have to accept that there is a science of the roots.

This is not a new science in India. Fourteen thousand years back somebody called Markandeya wrote about it. But it was not available to every person. We can say that it was a secret science. And was only bestowed upon very, very few people at that time. As we can see the Tree of Life has few flowers to become fruits in those days, but today is the blossom time, where people are trying to find out something beyond. They sometimes see the futility of their lives and want to know what is beyond, that is of permanent nature. So there is no harm in turning to our saints and great prophets and great incarnations who have talked about this knowledge. It is mentioned in all the scriptures that, "You have to be born again." But that does not mean that you just put a certificate on your head saying "I'm born again." Nor to form a club of saying "We are born again." When you are born again, means if you have jumped into new awareness, into new dimension of awareness, you should be able to feel the All-pervading Power of Divine all round you. Minimum of minimum that should happen to you, because your nerves get new dimension. And when you get your Self-realization or your second birth you become entitled to an awareness by which you can find out the roots of everything. You can find out the roots why people get sick, you can find out why there are incurable diseases, you can find out why there are psychological problems, you can find out why there are moral crisises, you can find out why there are political problems, why there are economic problems: because the tree has grown too big and has paid no attention to its roots.

All these problems are shockingly - standing in danger of destruction. You can see clearly people are announcing that we are all going to die or something is going to happen. Recently, just now, before coming to this hall, on My advertisement these people had put up there was another red caption put "Vienna is dying." But it is necessary at this juncture of modern times to look into the roots, the problems, why they have come and how they can be eradicated. The way we are confused, the way people do not know how to balance their ideologies one starts thinking that there is something wrong in the whole understanding. And we have to think what have we achieved for the benevolence of the whole humanity? We have big, big organizations, which talk of peace, but the people have no peace within themselves. We see governments who arrest thieves - they themselves are thieves. They talk of something and do another thing. So they have missed the point somewhere.

That point is very simple. The truth is: you are the Spirit. You are not this body, not this ego, nor these conditionings, nor Austrians, nor Indians, but you are the Spirit. Above all that you are a human being, you are the Spirit.

Now, English language is again confusing. The Spirit means the Atma, the reflection of God Almighty within us. Also it means alcohol, also it means a dead body. But I mean the Atma, the Spirit. We have to be the Spirit. That means our attention, which is outside, which we can understand through our senses, has to go inside. You're paying attention to Me. If I say, "Pay attention to your Self," you can't do it. So something has to happen.

And that happening is called as the awakening of the residual force within you. This residual force is called as Kundalini, because Kundala means coils in Sanskrit language. And also in so many other languages, like Koran it's called as 'asas' [base, foundation]. In the Bible, it is said, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames". These are the centers which look like tongues of flames burning. But it is called in the Bible as the Holy Ghost. But they cannot explain what is Holy Ghost. Again the English language seems funny - holy and ghost, one can't understand. But in Sanskrit language it's called as Adi Shakti, means the Primordial Mother. They say of the Father and the Son, and not of the Mother. How can you have a father and a son without a mother? It is illogical. This Mother is the Primordial Mother. And this Mother is reflected within you as Kundalini, as the pure desire. This pure desire is to be one with the divine All-pervading Power. And all the rest of the desires are impure. Because whatever we desire gets satisfied, but in general desires are not satiable.

So, the pure desire that is within us is the fourth power lying within us, in three and a half coils. Can be also seen in some people pulsating in the triangular bone of sacrum. If there is any obstruction in the higher centers then you can see that pulsation very clearly, like a heart. And then it rises like a - we can say, like a serpent, as they say, because it moves, the energy moves like that. It passes through six centers and when pierces through this fontanel bone area you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your own head. And you start feeling it all around you - the cool breeze, very gentle and soothing cool breeze.

This is something has to happen to all of us. That is the epitome of our evolution. But if you are identified with falsehood, if you belong to certain ideologies and philosophies and organizations and stick on to them, it creates problem for the ascent of Kundalini. And even if you are sick, mentally deranged, also the Kundalini stops at that point to get you all right.

It's such a remarkable thing and it's such a wonderful thing is to be a human being. Human being is made with great care and love. But in their freedom they try to go to extremes. Like now they are sitting in the sun burning their skins. Why? Or they are running on the streets ...

Aside: what do you call that, when they run on the streets?

Jogging! I'm rather out of date - jogging. Running like mad. They get heart attacks. If they start in a romantic way they just cross all limits, go on crying, weeping for something nonsensical. Then they get attached to things and possessions and waste so much energy on those things which we are going to leave everything here on this earth. The whole exhaustion works on the being, and it makes you very weak and fragile for your ascent. Then any new fashion starts, any new idea starts, it is regarded as something religious to take to something new. Like when I was criticizing Freud one day and praising Jung, an ambassador told Me that "You see, after all, Freud gave us something new. And Jung gave us something traditional".

I said, "The thought is a living process and it doesn't hang from air, it starts like a little seed, grows and then becomes something like a flower, then a fruit. It has to have a base."

Still more.

Yes, see, it works on the traditions which are good and which are bad, it goes away and grows into a tree. But everything new need not be all right.

He said, "But we should try."

I said, "All right."

We were on a dinner table. I said, "We had all this dinner before, but we never ate the table. So why not have a new taste of the table?"

It was undiplomatic, of course, but that's a fact. There is no logic in accepting everything that is new and jumping into everything that is dangerous.

To make this beautiful body that God has created into a shell of funny ventures. Perhaps we do not realize how many years have taken to make this body and to create this human atmosphere. Even how many human beings have worked genuinely to give benevolence to humanity? If we can really respect ourselves and understand ourselves, then it's the best way we will see ourselves ascended to that absolute Spirit. But if we do not think much about ourselves, if we do not understand ourselves, and if we want to degrade ourselves and feel guilty all the time for nothing at all, then it gives problems.

Tomorrow I'm going to tell you about all the funny problems we have due to our funny ideas. All the diseases of cancer to AIDS, and schizophrenia to madness. You'll be surprised, in Sahaja Yoga those people who have come are very wonderful people. They don't get any diseases, they don't have to be that protective, they don't get mad or schizophrenic, they are healthy, wise, peaceful people. They enjoy their virtues, they love their righteousness, they are full of courage and they are extremely humble. They are the ones now whom William Blake* has called "Men of God."

You are a special category, because you are seeking something special. And once you achieve it, you become entitled with the powers to give Realizations to others, to cure others, to be dynamically creative, to be healthy and to be the citizens of God's realm. That is what human beings are to be. That is where we have to enter into. That should be our hope. The world that is created with such care cannot be destroyed, whatever human beings may try, they cannot destroy. Partly they may, little bit here and there, but nothing dies. They'll be all revived, and a beautiful world has to be created by creating great individuals among yourselves and making them understand that they are part and parcel of the whole. It's not just a mental process by which you understand, but it is a innate knowledge that is born within you. On your central nervous system you can feel what's wrong with another person and what's wrong with you. And if you know simple ways and methods of correcting those problems on the centers, on the roots, you can solve your problems and problems of others.

May God bless you!

Tomorrow I will explain to you at length how do we get into troubles and how we have to get out of it. Thank you very much.

Question: May I ask you a question?

Shri Mataji: Now. Just a minute, not in such a hurry, I have not yet asked you to ask the questions. Now the time is such that we can have about ten, fifteen minutes for some questioning and please stand up and say loudly so that I could be ...

Aside to translator: Can you come here just to tell Me the questions what they have to ask?

Now just a minute, just here.

All right, now you can ask the questions. Come along, now. Loudly. It's all right - from there.

Question: If you are afraid of English language, he can switch to Marathi or Hindi.

Shri Mataji: This is not your suggestion, is it?

Question: Which language do You prefer to talk to him, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: To you I'll talk to in some Sanskrit, would be better, but or in Marathi or Hindi. But you know, English language has its own problems. Worse is French. We cannot explain so well in French so many things. But still if you say that this is the problem people understand. All right? May God bless you!

Please be seated. Now let others talk. That's not so important. That's not so important. Ah, now, what is it?

Question: Because it's written Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, is it a new religion?

Shri Mataji: Yes it is. It is, I'll tell you tomorrow about it.

Question: If it's - like Rajneesh - a new religion?

Shri Mataji: I tell you, this gentleman has come from somewhere. Do I look like Rajneesh, by any chance? I don't take any money from you, all right? Sit down now, will you, please? You are an Indian. You have come here to attack Me here? Then why are you asking such silly questions? You know I'm against Rajneesh and all the false fake gurus, I've said it a hundred times. You don't know anything about Me? Then you better find out, you better find out.

You are the authority, are you? All right, so you ... Ilme Rouhani is different. I said, I understand Ilme Rouhani is different. Ilme Rouhani means the knowledge of the Divine. No, not at all. You see, we have - all right, sit down, you are the Muslim. What the Muslims are fighting among themselves. Why are they fighting? If they were so much with the Koran, they are not supposed. But I'm not a Hindu or a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim. Yes, now, I'll tell you.

He is really off his head, a fanatic. He's a fanatic. (Applause) You see, I must explain, because it's better to explain these things, you see. Fanaticism leads you nowhere. As we have in Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, everywhere we have fanatics. And they have got blinds on their eyes. They can't see anything else. Now what Dharma he's talking is about the valency within us, of ten valencies we have got in our being, which as human beings we should have. And they are to be awakened within us. When it is not awakened - I mean, Mohammed Sahib was a great exponent of Sahaja Yoga, because He told us to do Namas, which is nothing but Kundalini awakening. Absolutely a Kundalini, but Muslims don't understand anything. They don't understand that they have to become the Pir as He has said it. They are not Pirs. That's why they are fighting - same with Hindus, same with Christians, with everyone. And that's why bad name comes to God. God Almighty is all right, but the fanaticism has led to this kind of struggle, fight, quarrelling - everywhere.

Now when he is talking about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma - means the Universal Pure Religion within yourself. Is a religion which is not just professed, "I'm such and such" and all that, but it's enlightened within you. You become the religion. Like Mohammed Sahib Himself, He would not do something that was wrong. In the same way, when you become that you don't do anything wrong. It's not a fanaticism and fanatics have nothing to do with ascent, they can never ascend, any fanaticism. Any idea of fanaticism is not going to help.

You see, there are so many Muslims, you can go and fight with them, why do you want to fight with Me? I've not come here to fight. If you don't want to listen to Me, you can go ahead. Go ahead, you can go away, it's all right. If you don't want to listen to Me, it's all right. There are many like you, you are not the only one. Many like you. All right, you can go away, there's no need to be here. All right, what else? Some sensible questions.

Question: How do You awake the Kundalini? What are You doing when You....

Shri Mataji: That's a good question. Where is it coming from? That's a real good question - how the Kundalini is to be awakened. Now, it's a living process in a human being. And acts spontaneously. It's a living process, it is not a process of some sort of a mechanical thing. It's a living process, just like sprouting the seed. And it automatically works within you. Only thing is like a seed you have to put in the Mother Earth, and She sprouts it. So those who have got the authority to do it from the Divine - not from any theological college or anything like that - but from the Divine, they also can raise your Kundalini. Then, once you get enlightened you can enlighten another person. Just in the presence of that person it can happen.

Question: How much time does it take?

Shri Mataji: Just a split of a second. Just a split of a second, really. But, if there are problems in between in the rising of the Kundalini it takes more time. And in some persons it does not rise.

Question: Has everyone got problems?

Shri Mataji: Doesn't matter, those problems are all right. Serious problems like fanaticism and all that - it doesn't work out, Kundalini doesn't rise. You have to be a balanced person. Little problems here and there - doesn't matter.

All right, now translate it. Not this fanatic fellow.

Question: If there is an operation, does it harm the process of Kundalini awakening ?

Shri Mataji: Not at all. It does not harm at all. It is your Mother. And a Mother never harms the child when she gives the birth to the child. It's your Mother and it's a very gentle happening. In some people you do feel little heat coming out of your head, because there is lot of heat in the body that comes out, actually. But once the heat is out then you start feeling the cool breeze. But apart from that there is no harm at all.

Question: Value - according to Sahaja Yoga - of the thoughts and of our whole culture? If you become thoughtless what about logic and books and our culture, does it not have any value?

Shri Mataji: You see, it's a - one should understand in its right sense. You see, when we are thoughtless - not that we cannot have thoughts, but thoughts do not invade us, we are free people. If we want to think we can think, but if we don't want to think we can stop thinking. That is thoughtless awareness, first of all. The secondly, the inspiration comes to us only in thoughtless awareness. Then the third thing is the culture is of the Spirit, which comes in us, which is a universal culture.

Question: He is saying that there are lot of other methods which turned out to be very harmful to people. They got schizophrenic, he is a doctor. How we could help such people to cure schizophrenics?

Shri Mataji: Oh, now schizophrenia disease comes with the movement of our attention towards the left-hand side, you see, that is called as the channel of the moon. Or, you are a doctor, you will understand the - doctors don't differentiate between the left sympathetic and the right sympathetic, but it's the left sympathetic nervous system, which looks after the emotional side of it. Now, out of fear or some sort of an emotional outburst or a kind of a mental stress, or ...

Aside: You translate, I am sorry.

All right, now what happens that through the Kundalini awakening now, see this is a chakra, say, this is the spinal chord and this is the chakra inside it. Now, what happens if you move too much to the left or to the right this breaks and the connection with the whole is broken. Now, when the Kundalini passes through that, you see, when it passes through that then it brings it back to its normal condition. So the attention which has moved to the left comes in the center and people become all right in schizophrenia.

It's worth trying. You'll be surprised, we have so many people who have been cured.

Question: If it's also possible to regenerate degeneration of the brain cells, atrostrophy of the brain. Alzheimer-disease.

Shri Mataji: Yes, in a way it is. In some cases it does not work out. If something in the organ is dead then one cannot work out, but if it is still living one can work out. Say, for example if you have put a steel bar in the leg for somebody then we cannot do anything about it. But if it is still living then we can manage. Another thing like a cataract if it is formed in the eyes we have seen it doesn't work out. But most of the things can be worked out, but if there are very gone cases then it is difficult, because the people also don't have willpower.

Question: Why we have mass marriages.

Shri Mataji: She knows that. We don't have actually mass marriages. First of all, you see, marriages are to be done after Realization, when the people have lived at least two years with Self Realization. That's important. Because there are many great souls who want to take birth on this earth. But we give full chance for these people to know each other and everybody cannot just get into it. They are nicely scrutinized and found out whether they are capable of a good marriage or not. As a result of that ninety nine percent marriages have proved extremely successful. Very happy relations and also very beautiful children. You cannot force anything or anyone. They have to offer themselves and then we have to scrutinize the person, because we don't want to have marriages which are of no use. And these marriages are also performed with a very cheap price - a very cheap price and they get very expensive presents, because so many give them presents. (Shri Mataji laughing) It's a good business. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter from the audience.)

Question: When we are a realized person we are more sensible and negativity can attack us more. How we can protect ourselves? Are those persons who are not realized attacked as well or they just don't realize it?

Shri Mataji: You see, when you are a realized soul you can feel the negativity much more than others can. For example, if it's a clean cloth then anything black on this shows clearly. And as soon as you see an attack, you know it and you know how to protect. Then there is no problem for you. But the normal people, even if they get cancer or they get mad, they don't know. When it happens to them they are not at all aware. You become very sensitive about your centers and anything goes wrong with your centers, immediately you discover.

Translator: He is meditating for years.

Shri Mataji: With somebody else?

Translator: Yes, and now something again new. Should he stop the other thing? It is difficult to make a decision?

Shri Mataji: First let us see if you get your Realization, that's important. First you must get your Realization then you will be able to decide, because if you don't get your Realization then we'll have to find out where is the problem. Actually you do not meditate; you are in meditation. Like this instrument. When it is connected only you can use it. Without connection, whatever you may do is useless. It is true about every religion, about everything. Unless and until you are connected with the Divine, whatever you do is artificial.

Question: Is it the one way - Sahaja! Is it the fastest way, or are there many other ways?

Shri Mataji: There's only one way. Now the only way to connect this instrument [ed. note: microphone] is through this, isn't it? In the same way. But it's spontaneous; it's living process. And it changes. When there is a problem then it stops, it sometimes it doesn't go ahead. There is a possibility. So one can't guarantee everyone. If it works, well and good. You cannot pay for it, you cannot order it. It's like a living process. Supposing a seed is not sprouting what's the use of paying money to the Mother Earth? She doesn't understand money. Nor if you stand on your heads also, the seed won't sprout. If it has to sprout it will sprout. All right?

Question: Does it mean now that other forms of yoga are not as good, not as fast?

Shri Mataji: No, other forms of yoga, like Hatha Yoga is used also in Sahaja Yoga later on, but in scientific way. It's like taking the medicine wherever it is needed. Now, supposing, your Kundalini has not started, how are we to know where it has stopped? Supposing it has stopped on your stomach and you are doing the exercises of your neck. What's the use? It is very practical. These days the people, the way they do their Hatha Yoga they take all the medicines together from the medicine box without any discrimination.

Question: Regarding movements like vegetarianism, is there a rule how we should eat?

Shri Mataji: No, in Sahaja Yoga you have to eat a balanced diet. Supposing you are a right- sided person, then you must take to vegetarian food more. If you are a left-sided person then you have to take to more right-sided food. It is a very balanced, open, fair understanding of the whole thing. It's not hard and fast rule for something.

Now it's time.

Question: Are there no limitations to eat animals in Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: No, only thing you yourself will judge, you will know what problems you have and accordingly you will eat your food.

All right, now I think, Doctor, you can come and see Me personally. What is the question? Last - you can come and see Me, it's better. I'll tell you all about it. You see, I also have done medicine, so I think I can talk to you better.

Now there has been a research done in Delhi University that about - we have done a research on physical aspect of Sahaja Yoga. It's been proved that a Sahaja Yogi is physically much more fit. And the doctor has got a degree of Ph.D. There's another research now going on in India about the liver and angina on these two, three subjects. But in London, with the help of Cambridge University we are going to start a proper recording of the patients whom we have cured of various diseases like cancer, blood-cancer, all that - because we have no record of it. Because it requires no money, no - I mean, you don't have to enroll in a organization or anything, it's your own. Is your own property. And just you have to know how to use it.

Thank you very much.

Question: What is Your opinion about Mantra Yoga?

Shri Mataji: You have to know what mantras are to be said, again, in different centers. Any mantra given can be very stupid also. You have to know your Self. All these Shastras, understand them, verify them on your Kundalini, on the Kundalini of others. And then you have to believe into it. Not just like this: I give you some mantra. It's nonsense.

One question? All right, tomorrow. We can have it tomorrow. You can give it in writing tomorrow morning, all the questions and I will answer it.

Actually, anxiety should be to get Self Realization. See, when we are blind what's the use of knowing about colors? We have to become awakened. And then automatically we know all about it.

Now, it's a very simple thing which we have to do. If you do not want to do it, please leave the hall. Be civil and you have not to sit here to be aggressive with others. Those who want to do it will take about ten minutes at the most. If you want to do it, then please sit down for about ten minutes more. But those who want to leave should leave and should not try to be here and not to do what I tell them. As I told you, I don't take any money, nothing, you don't have to give Me anything. It's your own for which I have come here to give you. If you want to have it then have it. It cannot be forced, it cannot be branded on you. I cannot call you, like a Christian, Hindu, Muslim or anything, like a 'Yogi' - you have to be, it's the becoming. So, only such people who want to become the higher personality should offer. Otherwise, sorry, I do not want to force on anyone.

There is one thing we have to do is to take out our shoes, because we have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

You also try, you might get it, please try, you're trying. All right? Better try.

All right, try to learn, if not you can go. But if you want to learn you can learn it. All right? This was done to Mohammed Sahib, is done to Me also, it's nothing new. To Me, I know, it is always like that. But if you want to see something that is there then you do it. There are so many Muslims who are Sahaja Yogis. All right, so then I would say that you should see for yourself if I'm doing the work of Mohammed Sahib or not. All right? How do you know from outside? You are not even realized soul, you are not a Pir, are you? Are you a Pir? Then, how do you say? Only a Pir can understand Me, you are not a Pir. You better become a Pir at least. You try to become a Pir, then I'll talk to you, not at this level. All right, now, if you want to go you can go. Then you can't sit here, I am sorry.

No, I will not allow you to do that, it's not here some sort of a show going on, you can go out, you are not here to see anything. Will you please go now? Thank you.

(Audience asks the man to leave the hall.)

Just send him out, that's all. Let him go, you see, it's all right. There are so many who come to Sahaja Yoga later on, you have to forgive, because they are still under the influence of fanaticism. You must forgive them. That's very sad. The whole world is like that today. So many are fighting, such problems, how to take them out of that fanaticism is a big problem.

So first of all I have to tell you that you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Not to be angry with you. Not to be guilty. Not to count all the mistakes you have committed. And don't believe that you have committed any sins. That is one promise to Me. Then it's much easier. Now, both the feet are to be put onto the Mother Earth, parallel to each other.

Now this left hand, as I told you, represents the power of desire and the right hand is the power of action. So when you place your left hand towards Me like this, then you express your desire to get your Realization. Now you have to put your right hand on your heart. This is the abode of the reflection of God Almighty. And the Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother. So, in the heart resides the Primordial Father and in the Kundalini resides the Primordial Mother. And here the reflection within us is the Spirit.

Now you have to put this right hand - we have to work only on the left-hand side, so put the right hand in the upper part of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. Now, this is the center of your mastery. And so then we go down in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now this is the center of the divine work. So you have to have the pure knowledge. This is in your consciousness, it should work. Now, again you go back on the upper part of the abdomen. Now, then take your hand to your heart again, please do it. Yes, yes, inside, inside your coat, it's very good. Now, you have to place your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder - from the front, not from the back, from this side. And turn your head to the right.

This is the center is caught up when you feel guilty. Now please take your hand on top of your head and press it on both the sides. Then you have to take this hand on the back side and put your head resting on your hand. Now, stretch your hand, push back your fingers. The center of your hand has to be put on top of your head. And you have to press it and move it seven times slowly clockwise.

Now take down the hand. We start it again, you have to close your eyes. And not to open them till I tell you. Please put your left hand towards Me. Both the feet on the ground and close your eyes. Now put your right hand on the heart, keep your eyes shut. You may take out also your spectacles because sometimes it will help your eyesight.

Now put your hand on your heart and here you say, a question to be asked, a fundamental question. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suits you, saying here, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times. Ask this question three times.

Now the second question follows. If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So put your right hand on the upper part of the abdomen, on the left-hand side. At this center you ask Me another question, "Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guide? Mother, am I my own Guru?" Ask this question three times.

Now put your hand in the lower part of the abdomen on the left-hand side and ask a question, or I would say, you have to request. I cannot force on you this pure knowledge, the consciousness of this pure knowledge. So you have to say, "Please, Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?" Please say this six times, because this center has got six petals.

As you say this your Kundalini starts getting awakened and is going to higher centers. Now it moves up to the higher center, in the upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side. To facilitate it better you put your hand on the upper part of the abdomen on the left-hand side. And with full confidence say ten times, "Mother, I am my master." Ten times. With full confidence.

Now please raise your right hand to your heart again. Now here, with full confidence, say twelve times the greatest truth about yourself, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

"Mother, I am the Spirit."

Now you have to know that the Divine is the Ocean of love and grace. But above all it is the Ocean of forgiveness. And you cannot do anything that Divine cannot forgive. So, please forgive yourself completely. Now, put your right hand on the shoulder, on the left-hand side between the corner of the neck and the shoulder. And turn your head right, on the right-hand side, absolutely on the right-hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence in the forgiveness of God, "Mother, I am not guilty." Please say it sixteen times.

"Mother, I'm not guilty." Sixteen times. Say it from your heart.

Now raise your hand to your forehead and press it on both the sides. Here, put the left hand towards Me, and here you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." How many times is not the point. The point is: to forgive or not to forgive is a myth. Whether you forgive someone or do not forgive, you do not do anything. But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So just say, "Forgive, I forgive everyone," from your heart. Now take this right hand on to the back side of your head and put your head, load of your head, on that hand. Put it upward. And now you have to say, for your own satisfaction, "Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive." But don't feel guilty at all. Now, not to count your mistakes.

Now stretch your hand, stretch your fingers backwards and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft area on your head. Now, here, sit straight, put left hand towards Me, put both the feet on the ground and press your scalp slowly seven times, very slowly saying, "Mother, please give me Realization," because I cannot force on you. Press back your fingers and press hard.

Shri Mataji blows into microphone.

Now take down your hand please, and open your eyes slowly, slowly. Take down your hand. And open your eyes please. Put your hands like this please. Just watch Me without thinking. Now put the right hand like this and the left hand on top of your head, on top. Not here - over your head. Left hand, left hand here, right hand towards Me. You can bend your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming.

Now put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the head, but bend your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming, or a hot is coming.

Again put your right hand towards Me, please. And left hand again on the head and see if there is cool or hot coming out of your head. Now both hands to be put up - like that. And push back your head. And ask a question, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the Brahma Shakti? Is this the all-pervading Power of God's love?" Ask this question, please. Now bring down your hands.

Now, those who have felt...
