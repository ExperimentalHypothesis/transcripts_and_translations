The self-realisation, which we know by the name of Kundalini, does not awaken through external factors such as one's practice, effort, money, labour, influence. In different religions, different arrangements have been made for Kundalini Jagran (awakening). Like in Muslims in the Namaaz, there is a complete arrangement for Kundalini Jagran. Putting hands like this, bending, lowering the head, holding ears, putting fingers in ears, etc. are all for Kundalini awakening. But it is all mechanical, artificial. Like every part of any machine can't function without power, in the same way, the subtle vibration inside us, which we know by the name of Kundalini, this also can't be awakened, with any human effort or through any artificial instrument. In the same way, in the prayers of Christians, there is an arrangement for Kundalini awakening. Like from the beginning, they give initiation which.is called 'Baptising'. Before Christ, whenever they were giving initiation into religion, they were made to take a dip in the rivers. You are aware of how much relief you get when you get into a river after your realisation. Those who were making people take a dip were not realised souls. Those who told them about religion were not accomplished people. They were doing it in an artificial manner. Brought someone, drowned them, brought them out and baptised them and have done dharmic things and given baptism. Even in this, there is a ritual called 'ablution', in which wine is used. Actually, it should not be wine, but grape juice, but they have made it wine and they give two things for everyone to eat. You know that we also give for clearing Nabhi chakra, water, and chana (a type of legume). This is the arrangement for clearing Nabhi Chakra. In Hindu dharma for ages people have made arrangements only for Kundalini Jagran. But we saw it in the most beautiful form in the incarnation of Shri Krishna. 

Stealing of butter, tying people up around himself by Shri Krishna- His idea was that if they were all tied to his Nabhi chakra, their Nabhis will also be cleared. Radha Ji going into river Yamuna and filling water, it meant that the water of Yamuna river gets vibrated, and when she carries a pitcher on her head and when Krishna Ji makes a hole in it by throwing a stone at it, the water will again trickle into the river and the river water gets doubly vibrated and when going through her Kundalini, the entire earth gets vibrated. So much calculation, planning was done. Only Radha Ji could do it, no one else was capable of doing it. Gopikas (playmates and devotees of Krishna) going to the panghat (Waterway) has a lot of significance for that in our place. In the incarnation of Krishna, they used to do many chores, but getting water from panghat was considered important. Its Prateek-symbol is that Radha Ji has to sit with her legs in the river. With that water used to get vibrated and gopikas filled their pitchers with this water and took it home and this cleared their Nabhi chakras, etc. Ras Leela is also nothing but Sahaja Yoga. You have seen that they all sit holding each other's hands. This is not a mechanical thing; in Sahaja Yoga, many people turn mechanical. They start doing things mechanically. It is not all a mechanical thing. Every action has to be understood carefully and you should know the meaning of every action and which chakra is getting relief due to that. Whatever chakras we have in our body, in all those chakras My powers are inbuilt. And when we bring them into use, those chakras become weak, their powers get reduced. There is only one power in Sushumna Nadi, which becomes Kundalini and gets hidden. We don't bring it into use. And presiding deities of all the chakras are only seated on that Nadi. When we spend the energies of these chakras, go on exhausting them, you will reach a state where you will exhaust all the power and presiding deities there will become tired, etc. In such a state, diseases like cancer start. Only when you bring abnormal usage on a chakra, the area surrounding the chakra which it flushes with its energy, the organs of the body will become diseased. But this Shakti has to be used. In all circumstances, this power has to be used. When you use them for religious purposes, our dharmic power gets exhausted. When we use it for dharmic (religious) purposes, the dharmic shakti gets exhausted. That is why, for dharmic people, there is a lot of pressure, especially on the Vishuddhi Chakra. Like reciting mantras. Reciting mantras harms 'vikhari', because the voice comes out of here. When we take the mantras in a very mechanical way, this power becomes weak and you will be surprised that at this place of Krishna at the Vishuddhi chakra, for those who chant the names of Radhakrishna day and night, their chakra becomes weak. It is very surprising that you take the name of Radhakrishna and your Vishuddhi chakra gets damaged! Many people chant the name of Shiv Ji in all possible ways, I have not seen so far, he who takes the name of Shiv JI before realisation, will not have catches in two chakras; the Heart chakra because it is His place and  Vishuddhi chakra because you take His name through vikhari; Vishuddhi chakra will be caught up and also the Heart chakra will be caught up. This way we keep committing all types of mistakes, because when a blind man....

That is the same condition for all efforts like Pranayam. Those who do Hatha Yoga, those who think they are doing Hatha Yoga, in reality, you can't do Hatha Yoga, because Hatha Yoga means, 'Ha' and 'Tha' are two Nadis; 'Ha' is what we call 'Surya Nadi' . Whatever they do, they do on Surya Nadi, because doing it on 'Tha Nadi' is very difficult ( and 'Tha' is what we call 'Chandra Nadi') and it is difficult because that means you have to go beyond your mind. Those who are only on Chandra nadi they learn 'Bhoot vidya' and those who are on Surya Nadi they become 'Egoistic demons' or 'Egoistic saints', whom we may call stunning, but they can't love anyone or uplift anyone, they can only curse. That is why even in the matters of religion, many mistakes have been committed, keep happening. That is why a person who looks outwardly very dharmic, he does not get realisation easily and he who looks very adharmic he will get his realisation in a split second. What is 'Tatva'? It is not that, is it different or less of this? What is the difference between the two, one should understand this; one person's attention is complicated and another person's attention is light. One person's attention is on doing fasting on Saturday and if he does not fast on Saturday, he will not sleep at least the whole week. Such a person will never get his realisation. Whether you do it on Saturday or Sunday, how does it matter for God? Has God given you birth for fasting? But he has also not given birth just for eating. A person's attention is on food because he has to fast, or he has to think of food all the time, the attention of both is gone. For many people, they are bent on getting up at 4 am, even if the world goes upside down. On a day when they can't get up at 4 am from 5 am, they will trouble everyone. What is there? We will get up at whatever time when we feel like we get up, otherwise we will not get up. On any issue, having a resolution of this type, our attention sticks like data. Some are like this and some are lazy and neglectful. He also has thoughts of when he can sleep peacefully. All the thinking is about sleeping. The cot has to be like this, this arrangement has to be there. I need this comfort, I need that comfort. I need a dress like this. If I don't get a dress like that, I won't wear it'. He will sit like that. If his suit is not ironed one day, he will lift the whole house on his head, but his suit has to be ironed first. If her sari does not match, gone, if the skin colour does not match, whether she is matching with the world or not, whether she is in harmony or not that is not important. The sari not matching she will make everyone's life miserable, from mother-in-law to father-in-law. 

This the hold of attention. If attention takes away so much time on any issue, that person will not get his realisation. If the attention of anyone sticks on anything, his attention will get caught up in such a way that he is lost from the world. No one cannot tell him why he is caught up like this and then it becomes a mania, he gets into madness as if troubled by an insect that got into his brain. If you ask him if an insect got into your brain, he will not admit it. But if he does not get his realisation, he will ask. 'Why am I not getting my realisation?' 'Look, it is because an insect has got into your brain'. We can call it obsessiveness, but sometimes it becomes so big that it cracks up. Like some people are obsessed with cleanliness, especially Maharashtrian women. Shri Mataji says something in Marathi. ......They make men's lives miserable in the matter of cleanliness. They want cleanliness. This type of madness must be surprising to you. You must have heard about this. Some people come to me for treatment for this. Recently a lady came. I asked, 'What is her problem?' She washes her hands very frequently and if she goes to the bathroom, she spends hours there. She scratches her hair, she does like them. It is madness. And the other extreme is to remain unclean, whatever may happen, whether you feel itchy or any other thing may happen. They keep snatching.  One is in extravagance, the other is in extreme extravagance and because of this, the attention wavers from one place to another. It is like an intoxication with Alcohol. Slowly he will land in extravagance. He thinks that it is my birthright to be extravagant and the entire world will say,' Let us keep him cool'. God save us from him. God takes care of him'. Becoming extravagant is not the way to get into Sahaja Yoga. 

Sahaja Yoga is on the Middle path. If someone wants to make money, he will keep on making money. It is madness. They are not satisfied, even though they are earning throughout their lives. Some are after positions and they run after positions, they are not satisfied. The other side is .....They have written a poem on helplessness! Sahaja Yoga is not for those who live in slums or mahals. Sahaja Yoga is not for him, he has one mahal and he wants to build ten mahals. Sahaja Yoga is only for such a person, who has contentment in him. One who thinks, I have enough food and enough earnings, a little more for carrying on day to day life is all that I need; One should have contentment. He who lives in mahals but is content is okay for Sahaja Yoga; he who lives in slums, if he has contentment, he is also okay for Sahaja yoga. Contentment is the middle path. When the man is contended, his chakras do not open much and there is no pressure on them. We have a lot of fantasies about our responsibilities in our minds. Being extravagant on this count is against Sahaja Yoga. There is no excess of anything in Sahaja Yoga. That means that whatever is there, you should be frank about it. I am not against anything. Those who want to earn money like mad people, let them earn. Those who want to beg, let them beg. Because they will not have faith anyway. But those who want to come into Sahaja Yoga, they should understand that some satisfaction is required. Another thing, those who are very vindictive, like I can express it very well in Marathi...Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi. Those who say, I do not like this at all, who are you to say that. I don't like this, I don't like that, one who uses such language is not any good for Sahaja Yoga. If someone is vindictive, if he tries to be overbearing, I don't care. Where do I have time for talking to such beggars? Where do I have time for talking to such useless people? Only when this comes, there will be Sahaja Yoga, because Sahaja Yoga is a revolutionary path in the center. Such people, I told you earlier, will be called missing links. When you live in that kingdom, they will be called missing links, who are extreme. That is why a cure for this is inbuilt for a human. First, you should have contentment and second thing if you can forgive people, half your energy is saved. Supposing you abuse Me. And if I keep thinking, what I abuse should I use, I don't know how to abuse. And if I want to take someone's advice, I was given this abuse, what abuse should I give? I keep on thinking, I run here, I run here. Instead, if someone abuses, if I forgive, it's all over. That chapter is over! Nothing further! As soon as you forgive, the other person will also change. There is no bigger weapon than this, there is no bigger missile than this if you know how to forgive. The day you know the mantra of forgiveness, the same day your Kundalini will cross your Sahastrar. 

Let us look at Agnya chakra, where the Kundalini stops a lot. If the Kundalini stops there,  if you have a problem with your Agnya chakra, the first thing you should learn is to forgive. If you get any thoughts against anyone in your mind, you should tell yourself, 'Beware, forgive'. Whoever comes to trouble you, forgive. Another person comes, 'You came to beat me the other day, forgive'. He will go. Now comes the third person, 'you abused me, I forgive'.  'He has insulted you, forgive'. If at Agnya chakra, one can't forgive, it is very difficult to keep Agnya chakra in proper condition. It is not that you try to show me. Not for Me. You for your own sake, in your mind and with a clean heart say, 'I have forgiven everyone'. If you don't forgive, all your energy will be spent in planning revenge,' Hit him, Beat him, do this, do that, abuse him, if he has hurled 4 abuses against you, you hurl 10 abuses, take an army from here, take an army from there. Just by taking the word 'Forgive', all your Agnya chakras have cleared. 

The other thing which is very essential for Sahaj yogis is that they should have love in their hearts. The heart should be clean. There should be a cleansing of the heart. Those who deceive, carry tales, tell lies, say this here, say that there, tell bad things behind the backs, such people will never get their realisation. Even if they get it, they will have catches on their chakras very frequently. Those carry tales against one another, their heart will catch and also surely Agnya Chakra will also catch. Because they will lose their ability to forgive. God forgives such people with great difficulty. 

Someone who deceives, cheats, pretends, lies and who without realisation gives discourses for money, he is committing a very big crime, God will never forgive such people. Whoever does any religious work without getting his self-realisation, he will be a big criminal in the eyes of Paramatma (God) and that is why God will never forgive. One who makes money in the name of religion in the society, Temple or Mosque, there will be a no bigger unholy and evil person than him. I told you that I went to Mathura, I had noticed that all the commanders of the cults, demons have taken birth in kaliyug and are working there as 'Pandas' (religious persons performing rituals). It is like this in all religions.  All the demons are wearing religious masks. But their crimes will not be forgiven. You are daring to cheat in the court of Paramatma; there can't be a bigger aphorism than this. To be in the righteous path, the important quality that should be there in a human being is purity, you call it innocence. Keeping oneself pure, not talking ill of others, not allowing any impure thought to come into the mind, this is the big YAgnya (sacrifice), which happens after Sahaja Yoga. That is why small children get their realisation very quickly and get it. The 'Tatva' of all things flows from the feet of Shri Ganesha, which we know by the name of auspiciousness. The one who has created the universe, the one who will also finish this universe and the one whose creation brings a new type of man can also be made whom Sahaja Yoga is establishing. A person who does not have any aspect of the auspiciousness, he is not a human but....( Audio abruptly cut)
