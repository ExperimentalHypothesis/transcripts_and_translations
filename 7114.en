Public Program. India, 31 December 1977.

So when you get your Realization, first and foremost thing you must know about your physical Self, which is not known to you so far. As soon as you jump into the unconscious you have witnessed that you come to know about your physical being, first about yourself. You come to know what is your physical problem, where are you suffering. Automatically you know that this is what you are suffering from. You don't have to go to a doctor to ask him what are you suffering from. Supposing your Nabhi Chakra is catching, you know that there is trouble in the stomach. If you progress a little more with the frequencies of that immediately you will know that it is in this part. Even on the finger, on the right hand side if you get burning more on the left hand side of the finger then you must know that the trouble is more on the left hand side than on the right hand side. By practice you understand exactly what kind of a trouble it is. But after some time you just say that it is the trouble, and that [it?] is what it is. It is like a computer you become. 

So the Self Knowledge, which is first experienced, becomes the actualization. This we can say is the second stage. But definitely in the first stage you get the experience of your physical being. Now see the beauty of it, how it is beautifully done. When you put your hands towards Me you understand your position, first of all. You do not realize Me, but you realize your Self. Immediately you feel the burning or you feel the cooling, or you feel the smarting, or tingling, or whatever it is. All that it is not indicative of Me but is all [indicative OR indicating] of you. Then by the vibrations that are flowing through My [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - being?] they are corrected. All these problems are corrected. Then when your machine is corrected, then the same [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - wash?] machine that Myself emits the vibrations or you receive the vibrations which are really Me. But that to an extent... to that extent, which you have achieved the clarity and the sensitivity.

On the other hand, when you want to know about the health of other people, then your machine does not feel your problems but feels more the problems of another person. And once you have corrected the problems of the another person then you start feeling your own problems. How beautifully it is arranged, you see, so that you [are to OR have to] you are compelled to cure another person. If you do not cure the other person you cannot feel yourself. That is how the unconscious is trying to guide you, how to be universally aware. This is the beauty. 

Now, to know about our autonomous nervous system, about sympathetic nervous system, even the doctors have to use at least hundred days to take your cardiogram, to take your blood pressures and to pass you through all pathological tests, and this test, and that test, and you have to do all kinds of things and lots of money is to be spent, still one [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - does not?] knows if they can really say this is this. But the Self Knowledge is so correct, that even a child can say this is the thing. Now it's not only the knowledge... For example now if you have eyes, if we can see something - is not that we can see it, but by seeing it, we can correct our movement, we can correct our vision. Supposing something is lying there and we have got the light in our eyes - we can see it. So we will not topple down over that. In the same way, in Sahaja Yoga, when you come to know about your physical elements and physical troubles you also have a power to correct it. You can correct it only by paying attention to that part, because your attention is now enlightened by God's love. You just pay your attention to that and you can do it. This maybe at a later stage, you can say. But in the earlier stages, even if you move your fingers in clockwise manner in that part, if you try to take out that trouble you can, by various methods of putting that trouble into the matter, which is created out of five elements. And the trouble also your obstruction is also out of that. When all these elements are in balance there is no problem. But when the balance is lost in them you get into trouble. So when in your body that the balances is lost whatever it is a trouble is thrown out into that element, and that's how the balance is established and you feel quite all right. So you have the knowledge of your physical being, for which you do not need a doctor or you do not need to go to a laboratory to be a guinea pig. 

Secondly you know about your mental being. Mentally you understand that you like someone or you hate someone. But you do not know why. But after Realization you can say by vibrations that you somehow [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - rather?] cannot stand that another person. Why? Because he's giving you heat vibrations. In the beginning the dislike was in such an abstract form that you could not understand why you just can't stand that person, though he is a nice person. But you don't like that person because that person is emitting such and such vibrations, which are against the divine vibrations, if you had any. Or if you were of the same type you would like. So mentally also you understand [UNRECOGNIZED WORD  - emotionally?] that why you somehow from inside - intuitively you call it - you don't like a person. Or you go to some house... You don't like that house at all. You feel terrible in that house, but you don't know why you feel outside like that when the house is so beautiful. Then through vibrations you can immediately find out what is the reason and you'll find out on your hands that [there is OR theirs] Agnya is burning. So you know what's the problem there. Now... now you can correct that. If the person is cooperative, you can tell that person that such and such thing is there let's just get rid of it. And if you become an expert, even without telling him you can get rid of the trouble.
 

So the knowledge of your behavior outside emotional behavior or emotional outburst for anything is understood through Self Realization, that you understand why yourself, you are behaving in a particular manner. Moreover, supposing you are a possessed person, you get a possessed feeling. You go outside, you get headache, you feel funny, you get [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - fainting?], you start fighting, you become horrid, people don't understand, you don't understand, you get confused. But with Self Realization you know that you have been invaded by some sort of spirit and you know how to take it out. And once you take it out you feel completely relieved and that's how you know your emotional Self if it is being attacked. 

In the hand, for example, after Realization, you get more vibrations on the right hand side and less on the left hand side. Immediately you understand that Mr. Ego is trying to press the Superego. So you can balance it by putting your Ego hand on your head and putting the left hand towards the Divine force that you give more force into this and you can balance it. So you understand your Ego and Superego more. That's how you understand your inner being. This is still in the gross form, still in the gross form you are understanding yourself physically and mentally. 

Now [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - intellect?] also is charmed or we shall say enlightened by Self Realization. Whatever you read before Self Realization you get a very superficial idea of the whole thing. But once you are Self Realized you think "oh, this is the thing that they were saying about" and that you must have noticed yourself that whatever you read you know which is to be accepted and which is to be discarded as false. You laugh at foolish statements and you accept those things, which are regarded [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - as naive and foolish?] as the absolute truths. Your priorities change, your [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - proprieties?] change and you become a person absolutely one with the absolute reality. Because if you try to accept anything falsehood you immediately start getting burning in your hand. [to what extent OR to an extent?] It helps you to an extent, because it has to maintain your freedom. So Self Realization helps you to a very great extent. Unless and until, deliberately, you [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - want?] refusing all the messages from the reality, it goes on helping you. But still you go on, sort of defying it, then naturally it disappears, you lose the power of getting the messages. But this is why it is Self Realization because not only the Self Knowledge you get, but you know how to correct yourself. 

Now, people create. They create things, they think they are great artists... They cannot explain how it happens. And there are people who appreciate also - they don't understand why they appreciate a particular art or why they do not, a particular type of thing. But when you see [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - universally?] when the greatest [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - cognizers?] sit down and appreciate an art, then an ordinary sahaja yogi can go and see and tell exactly if the art is esthetically rich or not, because the vibrations will immediately tell you. If there was even the slightest thing from that part [you'll OR we'll] find terrible vibrations coming. If it is completely harmonious, absolutely in tune with reality, which is joy, complete joy giving quality if it has got in its perfection, then you get the vibrations that are congenial to you - not only congenial, but are overpoweringly joy-giving. Sometimes you feel the flood of joy coming over you, dropping throughout and flowing over your being, completely cooling and soothing. And that's how we decide about an art, artist or an art piece that whether it is real creativity or not.

So you understand the art created by others. But supposing you want to create... If you already have the technique, well and good... Then the artist will find that he starts creating some fantastics things which he could never have dreamt of and continuously he will go on creating. So he taps or we can say reaches that source. Because if you find even the greatest of greatest artists, they will create about, say, ten pieces nicely, but at his thirty will be useless. But if he becomes a sahaja yogi not even one he will be creating that will be useless. All of them would be first class, the reason being that he is one with the source, so no question of making any mistakes. But the people who just get a glimpse, once, twice, trice, might be misguided and so they can make mistakes. 

But an artist who is a sahaja yogi is there at the source and full with the technique. In doing any work outside, say in your business, through Self Realization you get that confidence of your being. You feel confident because you are part of that life, light, and you feel so relaxed because you are just a drop on the ocean. So you are not thinking of cheating others. You are not thinking of bluffing. You are not thinking of all these useless activities into which people indulge and ruin their health and ruin the health of other people who come in contact with them. They have never a very healthy relationship between such people. You may cheat a person for one day, you may cheat him for three days, but later on the relationship becomes very unhealthy. So even in your business relationship you find that you understand the power of Self. You experience the power of Self and because of that experience you rise in your Dharma, in your sustenance. And when a person stands on his sustenance, you see, such a man has a very powerful personality. And he, when he tries to do business, then people depend on him, rely on him, and he is the best businessman because he is not only helped by his own powers, but at the time all the powers of the unconscious are at his disposal. So by knowing yourself, you develop your confidence and you know others and dealing with them. Even if you are cheated, say, once and twice, you will know that you are never cheated. On the other hand, the other person who tries to cheat you gets cheated. It works out like that, that's the magic of unconscious!

Now, what is the knowledge in a business? That you get the knowledge of creating wealth out of nothing. This is the beauty of Self Realization - that you can create wealth out of nothing, like an artist does. By little [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - tilting?], here and there, suddenly you find the same thing, which could not have materialized into wealth, is working wonders. In India there was one gentleman who got his Realization and he found out somehow that we make small little baskets - in India they worth nothing - and he thought that in America they will be selling like hot cakes. [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - Somehow or other?], you see, it came into his head, and when he started exporting them, today he is one of the richest men in India and he started with very ordinary things. Because of Self Realization, you see, you can penetrate into your own being and see at a thing as others would appreciate. For example, by Self Realization now I, though I am an Indian born, I can become an Englishman through collective consciousness. I can know what an Englishman wants, but normally an Indian can't. Now the [plight OR pride] of Indian export is that they are exporting things to England, thinking you are all Indians. [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - Even?] they could be English by any chance, they [can OR can't?] export the things that you really need here. So they will send you [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - six yard] saris [are useless OR unuseless?] with such horrid colors, which you think horrid, which Indians thinks are great. So you can identify yourself with another person, with his ideologies, with his ideas, and can handle the needs of other nations, other people much better. You see, we sell something, when others need something. Normally people sell it because they think this is to be sold. But by Sahaja Yoga only you can do this kind of a thing even to the material side of it. How Sahaja Yoga helps is an example [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - that you?] how you understand your surroundings, which formerly you were not able to understand, but now with Self Realization you understand, because you can identify yourself with [the?] another personality. And that's once you start understanding others outside, then you start understanding the outside life - so called outside - that is not yourself, but it is actually part and parcel of your being. And that is how the whole thing becomes a homogenous thing. 

Now, the greatest advantage of Sahaja Yoga is - the greatest of all - is that you know the techniques of correction. People are realized in this world, many are born realized but they do not know the technique. How to correct themselves, how to use their vibrations... They don't even know that they have vibrations, so many of them. So, the Sahaja Yoga gives you all the technique how to use those vibrations, how to correct yourself. Because of this a person who is a sahaja yogi can become dharmic. I do not mean any particular religion, [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - which you now?] understand very well, but your sustenance power by which you sustain yourself to be... yourself. Because unless and until [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - you know?] what is wrong and what is good, what is absurd and what is congenial for Divine, how will you be able to decide? And that deciding power is dawned upon you, You see, these people don't understand what I mean by "dawned upon you", but you people understand that, that you can feel it, that this is not proper, is not to be done. If you do it, you know you have done wrong, because immediately you know through your vibrations that you have lost it. Or something has happened to your vibrations, or you are a little confused and you find it out. So this is the greatest thing that can happen, that you know what is good and what is not.  Is not question of matter of opinion [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - with you anymore?] but it is a fact. That is why it is Self Realization. Because [itself OR it's sense] is a part of the Absolute you must get the values of absolute-ness in you. And if you can really evaluate everything in relation to Absolute you have no problems, that is what is Self Realization. What a technique! What an advancement! That so far everything is a confusion. You don't know whether this is right, that is right, this part of the culture is all right, or that part of the culture all right, [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - whether?] this what they say is all right, or what these people say all right - all kinds of ideas, confused ideas have come up... Everybody has written books, anybody who felt like writing, anybody who have five [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - pounds?] can write a book. Now what to believe, what not to believe, where to go, what to do? All the confusion gets sorted out, because you are now on a pedestal to see the confusion very clearly and your own pedestal, too. That is why it is Self Knowledge because you know what is your sustaining power. 

So you know the beginning of your spiritual life. Then also you know what others are doing to harm their dharmic life. Sometimes they are really troublesome to you. But gradually you start sympathizing with them, that they do not know what is Dharma, they're angry with you because they are suffering from an unconscious inferiority complex. They think: "Look at this people, they are saving their money, they are not wasting their money into these things", so they are angry with you. Sometimes they think "They have got their family life quite intact", so they are angry with you. Sometimes they find you're very happy people, so they are angry with you. What Christ have done? Did He do any wrong to anyone. He only cured people, what else did He do that He was crucified so badly and so brutally along with the thieves? Only thing that He did was [INAUDIBLE] all their ego was hurt. He just said: "Because I am the Light, I am the Path". Only for saying that much, He was crucified, because they couldn't bear anybody saying that to them. When such a great incarnation comes in also so far in the history of this world and universe nobody recognized them and they were just a waste, and all were misused by all the people. When they died, of course, they were so-called, you see, sort of worshipped, without any connection being established when they lived. But only through Sahaja Yoga and your Self Realization through Sahaja Yoga now you can make out who is the person who is really an incarnation and who is really a realized soul. This is the first time you can recognize Christ. Anybody who says "I'm Christ" you are not going to believe him, because you can recognize. Because the instrument that is your Self, that light is now burning within you, and you can see through that. Because you are really enlightened. That's why it is Self Realization. Otherwise so far, you see, anywhere great men were born. Socrates - just what happened to him? And what did he do? I mean, just think of it! He did not do anything wrong!  Galileo, anybody... because never truth was accepted by people who were not realized. They cannot, because they do not have the power to bear the truth. And that's why always, who propounded the truth was killed by people who really did not want to commit a sin, but out of ignorance they did it. So now you are enlightened, you are wiser and your ignorance is removed. Now you have the light. That's why it is Self Realization. 

Now through your Self Realization you can feel the pain of others. Supposing now you are born an Englishman. The average Englishman will feel unhappy because some Englishman is punished [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - somewhere?]. But a sahaja yogi Englishman will not, if he knows that he was a brute and he should have been... Because he detaches himself from that misidentification, as far as a particular nationality is concerned, because somebody [if?] is an Englishman or an Indian he should be excused... It is a very limited view of the whole thing. Why? Because after all we are all human beings. Anywhere in the whole world, wherever anybody tries to dominate and destroy the innocent human beings that are created by God is to be punished, whether he is an Indian, Englishman or anyone... Such a generous light enlightens your [path OR heart], and you become a different person. For example we can say [of?] Abraham Lincoln, a man we call him very great. What was the thing about him? He was very big. Why? Because he could see that when I do not want to be enslaved, why should I have a slave? 

So you [have reached OR are placed] higher only because you have stepped into the realm of Self. Otherwise you cannot, otherwise you are misidentified all the time: I am this, I am that, but you are not Self. If you become Self then universally you accept whatever is the truth, then you do not misidentify, your Self [INAUDIBLE FRAGMENT]

BREAK DUE TO SPLITTING THE TALK INTO TWO FILES 

...actually you are not satisfied. On the contrary, when you try to do something you feel all these three forces [ARE] very beautifully balanced are helping you. And you're doing the whole thing, as you say, with all your heart, with all your mind and with all your body. All integrated so beautifully and balanced, that there is no problem for you doing that. You do not feel hesitant about it if once you are established in your Self power. So by Self Realization you feel the power of Self. 

Now power doesn't mean domination by any chance, but it means the balancing power. Gradually you start discovering around you how you help others by your balanced personality. Then you also discover that you [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - heal?] help the atmosphere, help the nature, after the light of Self has come into you. You find that you become a vehicle for the unconscious, which flows into the matter. This [was OR has?] never done by human beings before, that they could flow the unconscious into matter. Now you do, because you can see that by your giving vibrations you can make some flowers so very fragrant, so very beautiful, some trees giving so much of fruits, some cows giving more milk, that you're surprised how you have given this power of Divine Love from the unconscious to the nature. So far man has been only [abstracting OR obstructing] power, or getting, gaining something from that. But no one has ever been able to give it any power to the nature that surrounds them. By giving power you mean that you give the vibrations to those which are other things, not human beings - like all other living things, like plants and animals. And you find that they also change in their productivity, in their beauty, in their taste, in their color, in their glow... That is how you enrich this Mother Earth from whom you have got [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - so much?]. 

When there are sahaja yogis together, if they live together, when they recite mantras and when they sing the praise of God, when they say prayer to God, the atmosphere itself changes. There is a change in the metabolism of the whole atmosphere that you can feel by the working of it. If you try that - supposing some sahaja yogis go and visit a country where there is a lot of strife is going on, problems are going on - immediately you'll find there will be a balance established, there will be peace established only by the presence of the sahaja yogis. That is how you realize how in so many ways the Self manifests itself when we become identified [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - with it?]. Why is it that so far the Self has not identified? Because it had no vehicle. You provide the vehicle, and that's how the Self becomes knowledgeable to you, you get the knowledge of the Self and you give that knowledge as vibrations to others. 

There are so many things one can say about Self Realization, which you can tell from your own experience, how you have been able to know and verify [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS -  various things?]. Now take the case of [UNRECOGNIZED PROPER NAME - Bart?] he didn't know much of Indian music, he had never studied them, had never heard it, but now he's understanding the beauty of that music and he knows what is going on in that music. In the same way, an Indian who has never heard English music, say your symphonies, he doesn't understand what is the beauty in it, because that has come from the unconscious, and now once he becomes Self Realized he immediately recognizes the unconscious, the joy giving unconscious which is hidden in those beautiful notes, which are beautifully [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - powered?] and integrated through the instrument of that artist [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - who has created it?]. Now whether he's an Indian, whether he's an German or an English makes no difference. But the unconscious has used that [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - creator?] but that has been used partially. Sahaja yogi can immediately make out which note is not good, which is striking, which is too much heavy, which is not in balance, which is creating a disharmony, because he is now an instrument which records, judges and also emits that what is reality, which is joy giving. 

I have to again stress one more very important aspect of Self Realization. Self exists in the heart of human beings. I mean, it is reflected in the heart. So a sahaja yogi who is realized and is depending on his heart or is trying to enrich his heart is definitely a more sensitive person. By rationality, by intellectual pursuits, of course you can accept Sahaja Yoga better. But a person who can feel it through the heart, the feeling of oneness with your heart, surrendering yourself to your heart, humbling down your intellect before your heart - that's the temple of the Self, where the Self when it enlightens the heart, the heart is reflected in the brain. When the integration between [the?] heart and the brain is completely established, then a complete integration between your intellect and the Self takes place. That is when you start getting the knowledge from the Self. This is at a latter stage, when you start receiving knowledge from [the?] Self. Not only the discriminatory knowledge, but knowledge of all the things. Whatever you want to know will be there. You just become a sort of a panoramic screen and you are surprised how the unconscious is throwing everything on your brain and you are surprised what knowledge... "Oh Lord, such a lot I haven't [UNRECOGNIZED WORD  - known?] just through this", and when you start seeing it you are not afraid of ignorance or of ignorant people, because you see that so clearly thrown before your vision of awareness that you start recording it and seeing it, telling it, verifying it and using it with all the confidence. And that is a time I feel that sahaja yogi understands much more. 

Today is the day when [the OR a] Mother is being worshipped as a Guru and is a very unique thing. So far mostly the gurus have been men. [I?] too has a Guru and his name is Dattatreya. And this Guru is also created by Adi Shakti Herself. It's a very funny relationship that exists because He is the father, He is the son, He is the brother - all the sublime relationships that can exist between a guru and a disciple who is a lady, who is a woman. 

Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - we one?] had to create a guru before the world was created in Vaikunta stage only. But then He did incarnated many a times. At the time of Rama, very early, even before Rama came into this world, much earlier then that, He was created by Satya [SOUNDS LIKE -Muslya?]. She was Herself a part of the Adi Shakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. There's a [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - legend?] about it which I will tell you some time. And She created Him, actually She created Him so She is the Mother. But then, She becomes the Guru. When She is born as Sita, He becomes the Father. So Father is her Guru. Then, when Raja Janaka is born as [Mohammed sahib], then She becomes again the daughter. But when He is born as Nanaka, then She becomes his sister. So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born in a way that, you see, that relationship is kept as a blind relationship. I [need OR mean] to say that they are never born as husband and wife. 

But this is the first time I would say that I become a Guru. I've never been a Guru in my previous lives. Guru means a person who tries to help the evolving souls to evolve. Helps the people who are trying to swim ashore the shore of Kingdom of God by their guidance. This is a Guru. This time only a Mother had to become a Guru. Because they being men, they were a bit too harsh and when it has to be an en-masse movement, it was necessary that a Mother had to represent the Guru.

So, I had to come as a Guru to human beings and talk to you and tell you in a motherly way. But a Mother's position is the worst when She becomes the Guru. Because children take Mother for granted. And they take always a great advantage of the Mother. They can talk quite rudely to a Mother but not to a teacher. They can be quite arrogant and can be quite quarreling with the Mother, because that is the relationship of the Mother. But before a Guru you don't even raise your eyes. So, this is a more difficult Guru [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - job?] than a normal one - to be a Mother and to give you birth and to guide you, because [is?] the most hateful thing for Mother is to hurt the child. Even when he's doing wrong, She feels hurt. But a Guru does not. He won't mind [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - scratching] you out in case you are doing wrong. He [won't mind OR he even don't mind] throwing you down from a hill if you have done wrong. He don't mind slapping you if you have done wrong. But for a Mother it is a very difficult task. But a Mother [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - does it?] to understand the children whom She has given Realization. So I am the Guru and also a Mother. 

Today is the day peoples, this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Purnima. Because as God has created days of [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - their advent?], human beings have created days of their surrendering. So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru. And Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say what you are going to give, what you are going to do for your Guru. Because so far the Guru has been giving. If you are in meditation supposing you say we'll meditate because Guru Purnima is there. That's not the way the Guru Purnima is to be celebrated, because if you meditate you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured you are taking from Me. So now what can you do for Me? Is the point you have to think about. What can you do? Now I have sent the same question to India, [INAUDIBLE] I asked them to find out what can you do for Me. You will say: Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we? That's a way of evading the issue. But if you really want to see, you can do a lot and that is what it is that you are My witness. You are My publicity.

So today you have to take some vows. And you have to say that we are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it and what may come we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother even if She's, supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our own good and we are not going to get confused. And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaja Yoga to help others, to emancipate and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation for that [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - full, full?] day when you will say that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this earth.   

So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce. For example if [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - you see?] there is somebody who is in India, I do not know his position here, but supposing there is someone you want to celebrate or you want to reciprocate, then what they do: they write in the newspaper that such and such man has done so much for us, so, we thank him very much for this. In the paper you see, you get a complete [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - threefold?] newspapers put together. You will find all the such advertisement appear all like that. You see, so this is how you do it that you tell people, talk to them and do it in this way, so that the publicity for Sahaja Yoga spreads, that you surrender yourself as a vehicle of this machine, of this great work. This is what God wants you to do.        

So today is the day of certain determinations that by such and such deed, or such and such time we will have these things, and we will do these things. This is what you have today [to?] decide and think about and this is what you have to manage and this is what you have to give. This is the only thing that you can give to God - is to become the instruments of God, complete surrendering yourselves to Him, so that this world of yours, this universe of yours, because I do not belong to any universe or any creation whatsoever. It doesn't matter with Me if this creation is gone or lives. It is for you people. It is only for you that you have to have this creation and so only thing that you can do is to give Me the assurance that I should feel that by creating this universe and by this world God has not gone wrong and by giving you Realization I have not gone wrong, because you are going to help in the complete emancipation of humanity. 

This is what Guru Purnima is. When you think on those [UNRECOGNIZED WORD - days?], immediately you will know what you should do for next Guru Purnima you have to plan it now. So maybe I don't know what in India they will do. They may have a big lecture, arranging [UNRECOGNIZED WORDS - my absence?], may arrange some big people to come and speak about Me, and talk about Me. I do not know what they will be doing. Of course I do not like you to take out the procession as these people are taking out. But there may be some methods, which you can think of, by which you can announce the advent of a Guru as a Mother, who is trying to help the people to find what they are seeking.
