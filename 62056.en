'Shri Mahalakshmi Puja', Kolkata, India, 26 March, 1989

Today the great festival of Easter is celebrated all over the world, but mostly people areunaware about it.In Sahaja Yoga we have learnt, that the resurrection of Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation ofChristian religion, which means that the resurrection of human beings must also take place, andon the basis of this foundation, we Sahaja Yogis also believe that without the resurrection ofhuman beings, without their transformation, we cannot follow any religion.His power was his wife who was in the Mahalakshmi form. As she was born from the ocean, shewas named after the ocean because Lord Jesus Christ was the incarnation of Shri Mahavishnu.And if you read Devi Mahatmyam, it is all described there, but we are unable to connect boththe things and see them separately.Today we are going to worship Shri Mahalakshmi. The principle of Shri Mahalakshmi isconsidered very important here, because this principle exists in the very middle of SushumnaChannel. Kundalini also rises from the Sushumna Channel. We must understand that till nowwhatever we have become, from amoeba to human beings, it is the gift of Sushumna Channelwithin us and our Parasympathetic system also works due to Sushumna Channel.When our Lakshmi principle is complete or we become satisfied with it, when Shri Lakshmiprinciple fully settles within us, at that point we move towards Mahalakshmi principle where wesearch for that absolute wealth which is imperishable.Now we see that in Bengal, both Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi principles exist to a great extent.First the Lakshmi principle has to be established. Unless and until Lakshmi principle is fullyestablished, Mahalakshmi principle will not be established. To establish the Lakshmi principle,we need to understand many things, and if we act wisely the Lakshmi principle will getestablished here very easily.We have seen many statues of Shri Lakshmi. We also have photos of Shri Lakshmi and we alsoworship Shri Lakshmi, but if you see closely, she has Lotuses in both of her hands, that too ofpink colour. It means that the person who is a Lakshmipati, like Shri Lakshmi has pink Lotusesin her hands, he too should have a heart that is pink in colour, meaning the one which invites (tohis home), the one who is always inviting, calling everyone in the manner a lotus gives place toa beetle which has thorns, whose body is covered with thorns, which is made of thorn. To sucha difficult creature it gives place in its core, (Shri Mataji addressing someone in crowd - notalking during the lecture, do not talk in the lecture, alright?) So it gives place in that core that

even a beetle can sleep comfortably, that's the specialty of the lotus. So, people who arevisitors, to invite them with that kind of heart and give them all the comfort, is the sign of aLakshmipati.Secondly, Lotus is also a symbol of beauty. Such a person is beauty- oriented . He keeps hishouse beautiful, keeps it decorated and his behaviour is also beautiful. To talk rudely tosomeone and getting angry is not the sign of a Lakshmipati.But we see in our society, that those people whom we consider as Lakshmipatis, do not havesuch qualities in them. They do not believe in them. And due to that Goddess Lakahmi getsdispleased by such Lakshmipatis, because they don't have the power of the Lotus that it floatsabove the water. It rises above everything, stands alone and makes everything fragrant from itsfragrance.So you can understand that the flower of Lotus is a very great Capitalist. It has got fragranceand beauty. It has got comfort to offer, it has got everything, but it stands alone and standing insolitude, it makes everything fragrant all around. And it's the biggest communist as well,because it can't rest without giving off its fragrance. Whatever it has, it is always ready, desirousto distribute to others. It is like the description of an enlightened person. Only he can bedescribed as a Lakshmipati. That's a Lakshmipati!But a person who is only worried about himself and only about his children cannot beconsidered as a Lakshmipati. For people around him, Lakshmi Ji's hand is always like this (ShriMataji is showing her hand is a blessing position). This hand shows shelter, that people who aredependent on you, you give shelter to them. You look after them. You take care of them andbehave in a very good manner with them. In your shelter means they are under your protection.They should feel protected in you. If any calamity befalls them, then you must look after thosedependents.Now when any calamity befalls a person, if you keep this kind of behaviour towards him, keephim like a family and he always feels that in case of any difficulty my master is standing with mejust like my father. If they get such feelings within, then you will notice that people who are inyour shelter will never trouble you and never hurt you.Atleast, in my life I have seen, wherever I found such a situation, I told them, 'Make everyoneyour family! Treat everyone like family!' What is our concern and what are we going to get?Except perhaps if you want to achieve fame, then you must treat everyone like family. Ifsomeone comes, you must serve refreshments and give food! It costs nothing!Those people who are miserly can never run their business successfully. It will run forsometime, and will close down soon because it hasn't got the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi.Miserly people are never blessed by her. Similarly, people who are not experts, who do not usewisdom, their business also never run successfully. Means those who are foolish cannot run abusiness.

So between the two, the central path is of Sushumna Channel, in which human beings can dothis work. How to make articles that reach the people? How to make articles that are of verygood quality? Now, if people say that they have to only make money, then they can sellanything by adulterating it, there is no end to it. If one has to do wrong, there is no end to it.Nowadays, what we see is that, you buy anything. Like you buy chilly powder from the market. Isaid, 'How can it be adulterated?' They said, 'People mix (Geru) Ochre into it (inaudible) It'sexactly the same colour.' Mix mud into it, mix Ochre into it, mix that into it. It's the greatest sin!By committing sin gradually the impact comes on your body. Here on one side you save somuch money and there you get cancer, you lose all the money.This is a great sin! To betray people like this is the greatest sin!Similarly, people do many such things like drug dealing and cheating people, and to give themarticles which are not proper but they do not understand that in subtle ways there are suchkarmas, due to which they get into trouble, they have to suffer a lot. They get bankrupt, thishappens, they go to jails, all kinds of problems.If you take the right path and remain satisfied you can nicely exist as a Lakshmipati and you cando your work nicely. Not only that you get fame, that this is one person who makes everything ina proper way, because today one item is made, then second item, then third one is made, so it'sbetter that anything you create, make it in a manner that you get goodwill. This is the sign of aLakshmipati, that whatever he creates, whatever he does, he puts a lot of mind into it, keepingin mind about the future, what will he put before his children? Even if you give them money,what will they do? They will have alcohol and will indulge in dirty things, but if you leave behindfame for them, then the children will be afraid of doing wrong things, word will come out! Wecannot do anything wrong! How our father was!And the world will say, 'Is this his son? He was a great man. He was very gentle and how muchgood did he do to so many people, and how nice things he created,' and like that the famecontinues. Do you know that in this world things are sold at very high prices just because ofgoodwill? Now, you may do wrong things by using your goodwill but it won't last long. Peoplewill know that now it's not the same quality, there is nothing left.It's a sign of a Lakshmipati, that he works for the benevolence of everyone. If he runs a factory,then for what? So that it will do good to all, and for his betterment as well. He will keepmaryadas (boundaries) in that too, because everything is perishable in this world. So, in thisworld everything is perishable, and whatever is (inaudible) is indestructible but whatever isdestructible, remains alright only in its proper boundaries. Everything should be done withinboundaries. A proper decorum should be maintained in whatever we do.Like if you love something, it should have boundaries of decorum. If you are fond of something,that too should be within boundaries. If a person becomes undignified, then those perishable

things destroy you only, because they have the power of destruction. If you over indulge intothem, they are definitely going to destroy you. (Inaudible)You know money is very fickle. Today you have it, tomorrow you don't have it. And if you have ittomorrow, then you can not say where to invest this money. The reason for this is that thebalance of Lakshmi is not accomplished. If this balance can be accomplished, then there is nogreater thing a human being can do, than to accomplish balance of all the four aspects of ShriLakshmi.The fourth aspect of Shri Lakshmi is alms. She gives alms. Such people should give alms. Butdonation does not mean that you donate to the unworthy. I do not mean donation to unworthyDonate to the one who is worthy of it. You should see where to donate, give alms. Means, If youfeel it from your heart that this should be like this and it should be corrected, then you shouldbetter find out if these people are not corrupt, because when our house was sold, we thought ofdonating it to someone. So the Sahaja yogis said that we will not take money from you (ShriMataji), not at all!So we thought of donating it to any organization. So nobody was recommending it for anyorganisation. They said, 'No, no, no this organisation, it is bribable! That organisation is alsobribable!' So I said, 'What should we do now?' So then I thought, what to do! I thought aboutwhat should be done, so I thought of making a building, making a house which has some art,because nowadays the type of houses that are being made, they last only around ten to fifteenyears. So, I thought of making a house which has art, in which the contemporary things shouldbe kept. So people will see the artistic things of this time, because nowadays nobody neitherthinks about them nor creates them. So this is how we made a vaastu.It is difficult that you cannot even donate to anyone but if you donate secretly. It's alright if youmake a secret donation, you give something to someone you get a lot of joy, but it should not beshown off.It's the habit of people to show that they have given something, as if we have done this greatwork, we have done this favor. Like American people, if they give you something they will giveyou something funny with that, by which (inaudible). If they will give you rice, such a big(inaudible) will come out and they will show off that we have helped you this much, helped youthat much. So it's better not to help If you show it while helping. It is better that you do not helpat all, because that pisses off the person more and it may happen, that he might come at youwith a knife!Whatever you have to do should be such, that the other person's heart feels happy, satisfiedand he remembers you. If you give alms in this manner, then a kind of joy is settled in your heartand the person to whom you have shown kindness will consider you like a deity. These are thequalities of Shri Lakshmi that have been described.

The greatest quality of hers is that she doesn't put her burden on anyone. She is standing on aLotus. It means that if you are a Lakshmipati it's not correct for you to put your burden onothers that I am this, I am that! Where this 'I' starts you should understand that your days arecoming to an end. First this 'I' must end. I am this! I am so special! I have done this! I haveachieved this! All this should be removed from your mind.Secondly you should work in detachment. Only after Sahaja Yoga, a person can be really aLakshmipati, till he stands in detachment. Money comes. It is coming, it's going, so what? Youhave nothing to do with that. All the business is running with that. You get and put it back. Againyou give, you get and put it back. But when you get the feeling we have got a lot of money, thisis my money. That's what messes up everything!But there is a man who is detached. Now suppose it's lying here (Shri Mataji is pointing towardsthe carpet lying before her) If I say this is my belonging, it's gonna be a headache. What if athief takes it away? It should be insured! So, if it belongs to others then it's very good. No oneeven sees it. (Laughter) Otherwise it's a headache! Handle this, handle that, handle that!Somebody else handles it, which is a very good thing!But it's difficult to be detached. We take unnecessary headache. By getting a headache we getinto trouble, that is how we handle it. How to manage? In Sahaja yoga you becomethoughtlessly aware. Means that now this big carpet is spread out. You simply keep watching it,whosoever has created this, has created this unique artistic thing. You feel all the joy coming toyou. You will not think about how much money it was purchased for. From where? Belongs towhom? No jealousy, nothing! But just on seeing it you feel, just like River Ganges flow you feelthe Ganges of joy start flowing over you. Then you don't think about how much the price is. Youare getting so much joy by seeing it, why should I worry unnecessarily? That is why, whateveryou do for others is a very good thing. The fact is that you enjoy giving all the things of this worldto others. Its utility is in giving to others whatever they like.It's very surprising that in love when you give something, people tell me, 'Mother, I didn't have asari like this!' 'Mother, that's what I needed!' or'Mother, I was thinking about it, this is what I wanted and I got it!' Now, how did it happen? Thereason is that it's Love, isn't it? And in love you can know everything about that person, whenyou come to Sahaja Yoga. When you are in love you know about everything that a personneeds,you know in what manner that should be given and how to express our love, not becauseone has to get any job done from that person, but expressing love itself is a very great thing.If you can express your love, I am always facing this difficulty, how to express my love!Sometimes eyes get filled with tears, sometimes heart fills with emotions, sometimes I try toexpress in words, but it's very difficult to express.Yesterday these people were singing, so much love was bubbling inside, how should I express?I didn't know what to say, how to say it! I couldn't understand how to express my love to them.There was no way to express it. Such questions arise. You get such questions after getting your

self realisation (inaudible). And things keep happening, business continues. Everything is goinggreat!Everybody tells me that, Mother, you go anywhere, how do you get everything so cheap? I say,'It was just kept there. I picked it up.' (inaudible) Where everybody takes bribe.Recently I went to Patna and bought silk for Rs.30 a yard. They said one can not get silk forRs.30 per yard. I said, 'See, here it is!'In this way you will get all the things, according to your desire. You have not caused losses toanyone, you have not harmed anyone, you have not quarreled with anyone, you got everythingbefore you! You have to give, isn't it? All the things are ready for giving.But in selfishness, if you have to keep them just for yourself then the price rises. Then the priceswill go up, and you will have to pay more (inaudible). When selfishness grows,then the prices will also go up. Then people say we have purchased such an expensive thing.We got cheated!But when we do it selflessly we really enjoy it!The prices are the same, whether you keep things or somebody else does. What's thedifference? In any case you have to go from here one day, leaving everything behind.When this is the feeling you have inside, it's a state within. In that state something comes, goes,it's all happening, it's all in process, everything is working out and you keep enjoying that. Whichthings belong to others, which things are yours, you don't bother. And this state when youachieve you stand like the lotus, you stand in your majesty in your glory. Just standing! Youdon't need outside glory. In your own glory you stand.Similarly when the Lakshmi principle awakens in a person and it settles in him, then theMahalakshmi principle awakens in that person. Then the seeking starts - What after this? All thisis going on. Now what after this? Then self realization comes into picture.Now, if a person doesn't even have anything to eat, if you go and talk to him about self-realisation. It won't work! By coming to Sahaja Yoga Lakshmi principle can be awakened. How, Iwill tell you.There was a fisherman patil with us. Everytime he came for the puja he brought a garland. Helives in (inaudible) come from there go there. He had children with him. I said, (inaudible) 'Whyare you bringing garlands everytime. I am already feeling bad about your up & down. You arespending so much money.' He started telling, 'No, no Mother! I don't need money.' I asked,'Whathappened?' He said that near his house he has a small farm. 'I meditate there and stroll there.One Sindhi person came and said I want to take clay from you.' I asked, 'Why?' So, he told methat a man has taken some clay from here and he used them to make bricks. Those bricks were

so good, they turned out to be such good quality that he had never seen bricks like that. So nowI want to buy clay from your place in kilos.So he said, 'I have become rich just like that, simply because of this clay.' He used to walk on it,so it got vibrated, and now the clay became like that. Clay turns into gold - it's the same saying(in Hindi language मिट्टी का सोना होना)- to be so lucky that clay turns into gold. Similarly, in somany ways it happens.I have seen in London there is so much unemployment. Any Sahaja yogi comes, there is somuch unemployment. Jobless people are moving about, because the Lakshmi principle is notawakened.There was one gentleman who was very poor. I told him that you should go for interiordecoration. He said, Mother, (inaudible) I said at least come for the programme. He came to myprogramme and got his realization. (inaudible) I said check the vibrations and see if it's good orbad. That's how everyone's work gets done.There was this son of a fisherman. Suddenly he got knowledge of art. He started making artisticthings. You will be surprised that he appeared for the art exam, afterwards he got selected andhe started (inaudible) in JJ School of Arts (inaudible). He started getting a scholarship.Therefore even the children, there are such children, don't know what happens to themsuddenly they become so great and famous and many children get scholarships.Lakshmi principle can be totally corrected if people take to Sahaja Yoga, then poverty can beremoved if Lakshmi principle will come. And after awakening of Lakshmi principle andKundalini awakening man gets in the position of (inaudible). It so happens that many peoplewho are philanthropic feel that we should improve the conditions of people, build schools forthem, arrange clothes, do this, do that! By doing so all good things will happen.There is a place called Vaarna here, where there was a man who worked really hard andcreated a lot of things and a lot of affluence came. When I reached there he fell at my feet andstarted crying. So I asked what had happened, at least tell me. He sat crying for a long time. Iasked, 'Why?' He said, 'I must have done a lot of sins in my previous lives.' So, I asked, 'Tell mewhat's the matter?'He got composed after some time and said, 'I made this Vaarna here. I made this (inaudible).Everyone got affected by that. I made a departmental store there. As a result of that whathappened- as a result of that (Shri Mataji addressing someone in particular- 'Please keep theattention here, you should be with concentration' ) So, as a result of that the condition in Vaarnais such that the liquor shops came into existence, prostitution started, every man has kept twowives, plight of children, all sorts of things.'

It's because they don't even know how to handle money! You should also know how to handlemoney. If you give money to someone, he goes straight to a liquor shop. One should have thepower to handle money and for that it's necessary that first you give them realization. By givingrealization, whatever excess money you will give them, whatever help you will provide them, itsresult will be good and as a result of that more affluence will come.But Very few people know how to handle money and enjoy it. If they knew, then there wouldn'tbe so many unhappy people in this world!Mostly the condition is such that the one who has more wealth is more unhappy. and they're inso much misery, that I get into trouble due to them. Someone told me that a rich man is coming,so I left through the back door. They will have all sorts of problems. There will be physicaldistress, there will be mental distress, there will be distress of the children. This will happen, thatwill happen, something or the other. All these hardships are like punishment.So, I went to visit my daughter's in-laws. They are all rich, very rich people in Bihar, very wealthyof all kinds. They were so rich that they gave me a lot of trouble. Could not even talk to mydaughter's in-laws (inaudible). They all had health issues. Somebody has some health problem,someone had some other health issues, someone had some problem, someone had anotherproblem. Everyone had problems. That means that human beings do not enjoy wealth. Theyare not the (भोक्ता) enjoyers. This is all mental, only an ego that I am so rich, but from inside ahollowness has come. There is no fun at all.It means that the Mahalakshmi principle should be awakened within you and that you shouldachieve your Spirit. Then everything gets illuminated by the light of the Spirit and you canjoyfully utilize everything.Whether it's a little thing or big, it's light does not come within. That's why religion is alsoarranged in a manner, that whatever religion you may follow, in every religion you can commitany sin. So, what is the use whether you have achieved Shri Lakshmi or Shri Saraswati.Like there are many educated people, but this depravity has come into them too. Like if youhave achieved Shri Mahakali, still what great thing have you achieved? You should achieve thespirit. Once you achieve the spirit all these three dimensions (sattva guna, rajo guna, tamoguna) shine in their beauty and you can enjoy them. If you really want to enjoy everything, youmust first achieve the Spirit, because the spirit is satisfied with itself alone. The one whichactually gets satisfied is the spirit and the rest of satisfaction which seems so outwardly is Egoor Conditionings. There is no truth in either of them . It's only your spirit which is the Truth whichshould be enjoyed.

And the land of Bengal is satisfied, quite satisfied in a way, but it is flawed by someimperfection. Also there is black magic here and people have taken the wrong path. Due towhich a lot of problems have come, but with Sahaja Yoga you can fully get rid of them. Andwhen these will clear out, first of all the Lakshmi principle will awaken in many people and thenthey will achieve the Mahalakshmi principle.And those people who are already fulfilled with Lakshmi principle, who have properly handledLakshmi principle completely and have kept its beauty intact and living with that beauty only, tosuch balanced people, Mahalakshmi principle blesses them with many kinds of boons. After thatyou go into the realm of God. There is no deficiency of anything in that realm! You say it and it'sall ready! You say something and it is done! You don't even have to think. Sitting here you getwhat you need.Then your desires also become different. Your desire will be, like a Sahaja Yogiis coming, you will become very happy. You will go and embrace him. You will enjoy spendingtime with him.In Ganpatipule people live in great difficulty. If you see, in reality all the people arriving fromforeign countries live a very comfortable life there, but in Ganpatipule a tent is put up and theysettle there and get so much joy that one cannot understand.There is no other comfort except the comfort of the spirit. That joy of the spirit works inside themand then everything seems like why waste time on useless things. Let's enjoy it here! After all,everything is for enjoyment! Everything is for enjoyment, and if it brings you joy, then why notaccept it and why not get settled into it?When such a kind of joy settles within, then one reaches that state where man has everythingdespite having nothing. Now the same state should come, my blessings to all of you on this dayof Shri Mahalakshmi.The other thing is the manner in which Lord Christ has done a great work of his resurrection, soit's very important for us to get our resurrection and it's really necessary to achieve it.So today on this auspicious occasion we all should decide that we will fully establish ourresurrection within ourselves and that we shall be fully immersed in its joy and knowledge.
