 (England)
I just remembered something from when Mother came to stay at our house. I was at schoolâ€”a middle school, a Church of England school. I went to school one day and, I think in a religious class, I told the teacher that God was staying at my house. I was 10 or 11, whatever age it was. We had talked about God, and I said, "Well, it's okay because She's at my house."

My mum was obviously summoned to the school; they wanted to know what their child was saying. She went along, probably with Kingsley or someone like that, and the pair of them explained that I wasn't crazy. "She's not there now, she's left, but she was there last week."

He just thought they were absolutely crazy and wasn't convinced at all when he left. But Mum was absolutely sure that God was staying there, so he was wrong and she was right.

Children say such funny things. My daughter brought one of her friends...
