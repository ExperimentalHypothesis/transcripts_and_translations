Public Program, "Mahakali Shakti". 8 February 1980.

As I said yesterday, today we are going to start from the very beginning, since when Sahaja Yoga started.
When I talk to you, I have to again request that, as a scientist, you must keep your mind absolutely open and do not hang on to any point which comes up in your mind; but try to understand that whatever I am telling you is today, maybe, a hypothesis for you, but tomorrow it will become a complete scientific for you to understand the science of God's Love.
Perhaps people cannot understand that all the sciences are come from God Almighty Himself.
To understand God's Love and Divinity, one has to open oneself to that absolute position from where all the relativity disappears. You are living in the atmosphere of relativity, we have to find out our absolute. Unless and until we find out our absolute, we are always in confusion, and we think that "this is maybe all right, that is maybe all right" "this could be all right, that could be all right", we try to decide everything through our rationality. As Gregoire has already told you, rationality is a limited means and I am talking of the unlimited. So if you have to go to unlimited, it has to be beyond the rationality.

So with an open mind, I hope you will listen to Me, after realisation when the power starts flowing through you, then you will be able to know how to manoeuvre it, how to understand it, and how to keep it cool.
Like one would explain about electricity first, then give you an experiment with the electricity flowing and explain to you how to use it; by using the electricity you will be convinced that it is a scientific proof.

I could have started the lecture from Creation, but that would be too much, to begin with. I would start it from your own being. When you are a human being, you are not aware as of what you are inside. As far as your physical body is concerned, doctors only see the outside of your being. The inner subtle forces which are creating you, which are looking after you and which are making you exist, you are absolutely unaware of.
In our being, there is first of all is the power which enters into our being from right hand side and goes to the left hand side which we call as Mahakali Shakti, is the power of Mahakali.
This Mahakali Shakti manifests within us a power which runs through the Ida Nadi. Now this Nadi or this subtle channel is inside the brain and inside the spinal cord. This being the energy you cannot see it when it is dissects. For example if you dissect this you will not find the electricity
This Ida Nadi on the left hand side gives our existence and at the [..] in the gross manifests as our left sympathetic nervous system. We exist because of this Ida Nadi. This is also manifesting all our emotional side of life which comes from our past, so it has all the past that is within us.
So Ida Nadi manifests, or - we can say - accumulates all that is our past [..]. This is our existence. We take it for granted that we exist, we do whatever we please in our ahankara; in our own understanding we try our level best to destroy ourselves and we reach a point where we have to give up.

This is all decided for you, how long you have to exist, which is all predestined. If you have to die at a point, you will die. There is no one who is going to stop that. So, some people who come and tell Me "Mother, somebody is dying or dead, can you make him live?" If you ask to live, you will definitely live. Only the miracle of God makes you believe in Him, but your time of birth and death are absolutely destined, which must be accepted.

It is not the way it is described here in the, your [kundalis], in your horoscopes. In the horoscope, for example, a gentleman was to die about 5-6 years back and he came to me, he got his self-realistion and he lived much longer after that, he is still living. So he went to his pandit, he asked him "How is it that you predicted that I am going to die this year and still I am living". Then he saw into the horoscope and said "By the way, did you meet any great spiritual personality?". He said "I did meet someone!" He said "That's the reason! I should have told you that if you have met, if you meet this Lady then this will be avoided". And it was to be avoided and he [..].
In a way there is [san-joga] always. Because you are here, you should think that you have deliberated something, but it was to be that you should be here.
Now if you do not take the advantage of this san-yoga, that freedom is [..]. But san-yoga was created by God, He organizes and arranges that you meet the right person, that you get the right thing; but it is left to your freedom that you choose the right or the wrong. Mostly we go according on our own whims and undestanding.
Even then, if supposing our understanding was a pure understanding and a simple understanding, we would know, we would very sensitive to know who is a real person and who is not. But normally when we live, we plays with our existence, why try to minimize our sensitivity.

This left side can be described also as a destructive side, because if it does not exist it is destructive, it destroys you. That is how is called also a destroying power, that by this power you can be destroyed. If you are not to be existing any more, the same power can destroy you.

Now this left side power is very important and is very very [.vital.] for our country especially where we have traditions within us. 
Left sided people, those who are indulging into left side too much, are very emotional, and they take to bhakti. If they take to bhakti, they go on calling God and working on that and doing all kind of emotional expressions to get... this bhakti kal developing to our country, God knows how many years back, but has been working and there are many people who have been getting into this bhakti kal.
But when you cross a certain limit of this left side, you enter into collective subconscious. This is the subconsious when you go beyond that. If you go into collective subconsious, then you might find yourself attacked by people who you do not know or maybe you know and that is how we get people who are get possessed.
All your emotional problems, all your mental problems - which are called as lunacy and all that - are coming because of the defective behaviour in this area.
If you go into the left side area, as I told you, by any means; like someone if very fond going through cemeteries - I do not know why but there are some funny people like that; we had a doctor in London, he is a Russian doctor, but now he is in Australia; he came to Me and he had a problem on this left had side, Ida Nadi. And I was amazed, I said, "How can this doctor from Russia and living in Australia, now in London can have such a problem like that" and asked him several questions "Do you live near a cemetery? or do you have somebody dead in your family? have you wept for someone? somebody has shocked you? or what has happened that this left side is so weak in you? or have you been indulging too much of drug taking or something like that?". He said "None, Mother, I have not done anything like that, neither I have been this way", I said "Try to remember" and he remembered that his grandmother was very fond of going to cemetery and his childhood, she used to take him in the pram, when she was walking also she used to take him; until he was quite old, she always used to take him to that cemetery. Just imagine, it is such a funny thing that we do not know in our past how we were indulging in this left hand side activity.

Now, in our country, whatever tradition we have had, all of them mostly come from the great saints who were meditating. Not most of them, but I would say quite a lot of them. But we cannot say there is not a single tradition which is wrong in India. But the traditions can get perverted later on. But basically - if you see - our traditions are very sensible. Like when a person dies, whatever ritual we have, it's a very very sensible ritual. We Indians are not aware of the rituals that we do; of course in that when Brahmins started taking money, that was the perversion. Nobody should take money if somebody [dies]. It is very sinful to do that, because he will be affected by the left hand side attacks.
Those people who do all this kind of work and earn money out of the death of others are very dangerously placed.
Moreover when you also [strain] that somebody is dead in your family... so many people, when they come to Me, I find that left hand side is a problem [within them]. The reason is that if somebody is dead - say the father is died early, or the mother has died early - then people start worrying about that person. If father has died at a very early age, supposing in the case of a girl, she is very insecure; all the time she is thinking about him; then that kind of a mind can create problem on the left hand side and we have to clear it out.
That is why is very important what we do [..]. Those people have died, have gone to another world, they had to go, they are not to hang around here; and we are not to keep them back and keep them under our bondage of emotions, this we should understand. You see, in modern times, just we give up everything that was old, this is a very wrong thing because whatever they have discovered is of [..]. I have seen people that even if you tell them that you forget, forget about it, now do not worry about it, they will not listen and then you will find them getting into serious disease like epilespy, into lunacy and other mental troubles. Specially among women we find hysteria develops if this kind of a problem is there.

Now it is not easy to believe into a thing that there is something like dead bodies hanging around; is very very difficult for a very educated man to believe in such a nonsense, but they do. You have to know that they do exist. Now that does not mean that you believe in their powers, but you must know that they exist and that is why you have to keep in your maryadas, you have to keep in the centre and do not go too much on one side.
In bhakti also, when people overdo it, like if they start weeping and crying and sayng that "Oh Lord, you must come and give us a darshan or something like that." Unilt evening they fast and they say that "Unless or until you appear before us you are going to die." All these things when you try this emotional style of working it out. 
You cannot achieve it, because this is your manas, this is your mind. Through your mind you cannot achieve God. By crying or weeping you are going to [..], you will do all kind of nonsensical things that people might think that you are mad. They might think that you are just acting, I do not know what they will think. But you do not achieve anything by this kind of crying.
For example now we have in India - I mean it started here I think, this Hare Rama Hare Krishna. These people are so funny in Oxford street (if you go in London) you will find them wearing those dhotis and saris. They do not know how to wear and how to carry on with them. They are taking a [.dhoti.] in a hand
