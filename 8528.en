Puja on the shores of Vaitarna river, India Tour, December 15th, 1985

English Transcript

We have come to the land of Yoga and in Yoga one has to receive the blessings of peace and truth. So this land is the land where peace must reside. And you are the one who are going to create that atmosphere of peace, here and abroad.

The nature in this land, or in any land, is very congenial to the divine happenings. First they told me that in this place it will be very cold and all of you will have to wear sweaters, but when I came here I was really perspiring. So how nature has also welcomed Me!

In India, it being a very unsophisticated, simple and ancient country, the vibrations are felt with great ease and it has maintained its holiness. But the people from this country, who believed in the holiness of the atmosphere, by leading a holy life, have taken to many things which may not keep the same level of holiness.

Never, in the history of this country also, so many saints have opted on this holy land.Today you all have come here to enjoy the gift, the warmth of the love of the Divine, and also to emit and manifest that love in your own country.

I have to request you for one thing, that the culture of this country is bound by the spiritual consideration, by the consideration that ultimately, we have to ascend. Of course, now we have a lot of hypocrites, many more than the real [UNCLEAR], but still, the culture as such aims like that, it respects all the other cultures, as long as it respects the Spirit.

So when you come to this country, you must also respect the culture of this country and try to understand why a thing has still been carried on traditionally for so many years. Thanks to heavens that we haven’t become that affluence to forget God, but still we have many many many people in this country, who think that getting money, getting affluence, is the only way to be happy. It is you who can fight it out to them that when you got all your affluence also you have to come to God to get to your happiness and to enjoy.

As you must have seen now, in the course of Sahaja Yoga, that it is a very very deep feeling within us, it is not what you discuss or argue or think. That is the process we followed earlier, when we were not realized souls, when we had not entered into the Kingdom of God, that we could discuss, talk, argue, or we could aggress and we could manipulate, manufacture. But when you become, then the best quality is to be, to absorb, more and more of divine knowledge. It is not a mental thing nor a mental absorption, because, so far, you have used only mental projection. But now, the whole process has to be changed and you have to use your own growth, through the awakening of your Kundalini, through the raising of your Kundalini, through the maintaining of your kundalini at that level.

The transformation has taken place no doubt. But to go further, you cannot use your mental capacity, but to use your spiritual capacity. This is what we forget, that the process that we used, so far, doesn’t work out. Once you realize this point, I’m sure during your tour, you will definitely enjoy the absorption and the love of God. At the very outset, I must say, I expect a lot from this trip. I expect that a very good quality Sahaja Yogis have come from abroad, and they are going to fully establish themselves in this tour. If we have another tour, well and good, even if not, let us accomplish it in its full way.

Now this land has a very good blessing point for us which has been actually in a way donated by the Divine. It is along the river Vaitarna, and in Sanskrit language “Vaitarna” means the ocean of illusion. “Vai” means whatever is perverted or which is not the right thing, which is improper, the illusion. When you see the illusion you do not see the right image. So this is the river which takes you across the ocean of illusion. “Tarana” means the one which salvages, is the one which gives you salvation.Along this river, to have our school would be a great blessing I think and it’s a great thing that we can do.

Here, now, as you see it’s a very large area, we can even have ten schools here. But in any case, for the Sahaja Yogi children, now we find, there is a big solution, that they could study in a proper atmosphere, in the company of beautiful nature and simple villages, so they develop a temperament that is peaceful, that is glorifying or glorious and the one that is full of hope for the whole universe.

With that hope, we have taken this land here and I hope the day will come when we’ll have very beautiful little little houses for the little children to stay here.

Marathi translation

Now my blessings to all in this village of Vaitarna, and many many thanks to you all on behalf of all Sahaja Yogi's, you have taken efforts in providing the land so when the school gets built the growth should be for all and in all aspects and the importance of this land Vaitarna should spread universally, i feel this place has some special importance and the people from this place should also understand that in this place God has given us this task which is God's work, this is a big task, we cannot make any mistakes in God's work, you should desire on how and where to contribute effectively in God's work.

When will you get opportunity to do God's work? During my father's time, when Gandhiji started the movement for Freedom fight at that time people sold houses and belongings along with family and children to participate in it, we were well off, we sold our belongings and started living in hut, but in today's age when Sahaja Yoga is an art of attaining complete self independence in which a person attains complete independence and is not affected by the 6 enemies of the soul; till such time that you attain this state you should as at least little bit as much as possible, whenever possible continue practicing.

So one who has decided to do God's work should know its prime and very big work, its not about money, you don't have to do anything as such, only prepare mentally, through body, mind, money is not needed, with all this you should serve God. God has given us so much, What have we given in return? Sahaja Yoga is also gifted to us, so what are our contributions to Sahaja Yoga we should introspect, have we done any sacrifices, just giving up a piece of land is not going to suffice, keeping me rest assured, you should take up the responsibility and complete the project properly, with this intention and desire you can achieve it.

Now this is just the start, everyone should ensure this project is focused and completed properly till end. People from places like Mumbai (Mumbaikar), Varshi, surroundings and likewise people from Maharashtra all have contributed to make this happen, and this will be the best school internationally and from this school beautiful children will be groomed, so we should be proud of it, this is a matter of big pride and for this to happen, we need to think of what efforts we have to put in, what contributions or sacrifices is needed to materalise it.

You only need to desire and vocalize it you will get the blessings of Shri Saraswati and your desires will be fulfilled, as prophesied by Saint Dnyaneshwar and that will happen, all my infinite blessings to all Sahaja Yogi's.

In the path of progress there should not be petty and internal conflicts, its not about individual prosperity , its collective work to be done together with cooperation,love,friendship and benevolence for all.

In a society where task is to be done, there is complete awareness about it, in our country the fight for freedom is done, so how can we server God, it has to come from within and executed by you. Although building the school was my idea and it was practically made possible by foreigners, you need to desire on how you can make it possible or contribute towards it, your desires will be fulfilled, so desire such thatthe auspiciousness and blessings are for all.

May God give you a good intellect.
