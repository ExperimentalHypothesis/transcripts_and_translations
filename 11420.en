Public Program Day 1, Hotel Grande Bretagne, Athens (Greece)

500 years before Christ, the great master Socrates [UNCLEAR in your country] told the whole world that we have to know ourselves. And he was wisdom personified. But he was killed. He didn’t do any harm. He just told everyone for their benevolence. He didn’t live for himself. And he lived for others. He did not take any money from anyone for his knowledge nor did he punish anyone but he was punished. 500 years later Christ came in. He said also, “Know thyself”. Every scripture is saying that “Know thyself.” Like Buddha did not even talk of God because he did not want to put attention of people away so he said, “First know thyself.” Maybe they were not given any chance to tell how to know themselves. But the time has come now. We can say that on the tree of life there were one or two flowers in the beginning but today it is the blossom time and so many are seeking the truth. Socrates could not have got so many people to listen to him in Greece. But today is the time that human awareness has evolved to that state that it wants to know the truth beyond this mundane life. Maybe one can say the situation is such today because we are waiting for a kind of a shock of our destruction or maybe we are confused and that we want to know the absolute. This knowledge which I am going to tell you is the knowledge of the roots. Now in the world we have the knowledge of the tree. Tree which has grown, outgrown itself without any balance. Without any balance, the tree which has grown. And if it does not look after its roots it will suffer and will be destroyed. It is inevitable. So this knowledge whatever I’m going to tell you has to be taken with an open mind of a scientist. It’s like...sorry...it’s like a hypothesis that I put forward before you and if it is proved then as honest people you have to accept it. You’ve been already told about the chakras, the centers we have. As you call them kendra we too call kendra in Sanskrit language. Now the word Athena...sorry...

Translator: No it’s okay [UNCLEAR I couldn’t understand]

...The word Athena is the word comes in Sanskrit language like aatha means the Primordial - the Primordial Mother. So it was discovered that there was the Father, there was the Child and there was also the Mother. And the one whom we call Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother - the Athena. And the snake she carries in herself is significant with the same Kundalini we talk about. That’s her symbol. So it was known to Greeks I think at that time about Kundalini. This power which I call as Kundalini is the reflection of that Primordial Mother or the Holy Ghost within ourselves. She resides in the triangular bone called sacrum. Sacrum is the word given by I think Greeks meaning sacred perhaps.

Translator: Yes, exactly

That’s...they knew this was a sacred bone. And also they knew there was something sacred energy in it. So when this energy rises within you with the living force it pierces through your fontanelle bone area. The soft bone of your head. And you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your own head. This is the real baptism. It’s not artificial. It’s a living process of your evolution - the last breakthrough. And this breakthrough is into collective unconscious which becomes conscious within you. So for the first time you start feeling around yourself this subtle energy of Divine love which does all living work. Like see now the roses the rose bush will produce only roses. Every tree produces it’s own style. [It] is a is a fact by medical science that anything that goes into your body is thrown out. But when a child is conceived it is not thrown out at all on the contrary it [is] looked after, nurtured and at the right time it is thrown out. Who does this? These flowers are miracles but we say [see] them everyday. We don’t want to know also how they have come up because this is the living process. In the same way Kundalini rises through your limbic process. When it rises, it touches your fontanelle bone area and pierces through there is this is the seat of your Spirit.

Translator: The [UNCLEAR seek, sick, sea?]

The seat

Translator: Seat

...pitha, the seat. But normally the Spirit resides in your heart. But when the Kundalini reaches the seat, the Spirit starts emitting light into our attention. So far the Spirit though reflected in the heart is just a witness but when the light of the Spirit comes in our consciousness then we know about our own centres and about the centres of others. This is the first thing that happens. On your fingertips you know because these are sympathetic endings and they become sensitive and they tell you what’s wrong with your centres. So now if you know how to decode and how to cure those centers you can cure yourself and you can cure others. But as this Kundalini rises through these centers all the centers get enriched. And when it gets enriched all the centers also get corrected. So physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually you are nourished. As a result you get cured of your physical troubles and also you get rid of all your habits which are enslaved. Once Sahaja Yoga spreads and people become realised they don’t have to put military to stop drugs. Automatically Sahaja Yogies don’t drink don’t smoke don’t take drugs, they don’t even have match boxes with them. If such a different life of complete compassion and enjoyment. You become so dynamic in your creativity and in understanding and in your awareness. For example most of the musicians are English and Swiss and French they are, plus Greece Greek. Now English were lived in India for three hundred years they could not speak one sentence of any one of our language. They tried they tried but were not successful. They thought it was very difficult and I haven’t met one French gentleman who knows even a word about Indian language. And Swiss are the worst because they know only bad thing. And we have Germans imagine Germans, so beautiful they have become and so loving with each other. All this happens only when you get your self realisation. You become a very powerful peaceful person and all your Karmas and all your conditionings drop. For example one could be a Christian, could be a Hindu could be a Muslim could be anything but can commit any sin. There is no difference in that. I mean nobody says, because I’m this I cannot commit a sin but does it. Supposing you go in the jail you’ll find murderers are universally living there from every religion.

Translator: What Shri Mataji?
In the jail.

Translator: In the jail?

There is no way of differentiation till they die and have different cemeteries. Otherwise there is nothing gained within themselves. But when Kundalini rises you become a universal being. And every human being who has got ten valencies, they all get awakened. And they become saintly godly people. Now they don’t have to leave their houses. They have very [UNCLEAR sane, saint] marriages and they married very happily and have very beautiful realized souls as their children. They become steady parents and they produce beautiful children. They whole thing sounds very fantastic but supposing we take a little television to an Indian village and tell them that this box can show you all kinds of pictures from all over the world they wouldn’t accept.

Translator: Sorry Shri Mataji [UNCLEAR]

In the village, Indian village...

Translator: Yes

...if you take a television and show them then they won’t accept that it will show all the pictures but when you put it to the mains they see the wonders of television. In the same way human beings are put to the mains, to this all pervading power like the connection here. And then one realises how great you are, how glorified you are and how capable you are and a real transformation takes place. So this is the time, so this is the time for our transformation and for the emancipation of human beings. Today we’ll have the programme which will take about ten fifteen minutes of Kundalini awakening. You won’t have to do anything about it. It is spontaneous, without any effort. Just like a seed can sprout, it will happen to you also. If it doesn’t happen, it will happen tomorrow but has to happen to all of you because it’s your right as human beings - the epitome of evolution - to have this. Of course you cannot pay for it, you cannot organize it, you cannot order it. It just works because it is built-in within you so I think let us now have little questions from new people and then we’ll have this programme but don’t ask too many questions. Even I mean answer your questions is all right but these are webs of words. That’s not going to give you Realization. Webs of words. Best is to have the experience of your own [UNCLEAR being, meaning] and then better to talk about it. May God bless you all.

...I think you all are in a very right mood. I think that speaks; is to understand that you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God and you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. And at the very outset I would suggest another thing is not to feel guilty at all. Forget the past and don’t count your mistakes. Forgive everyone. It’s a myth to say that you can’t forgive because you don’t do anything whether you forgive or you don’t forgive. So you should not play into the wrong hands so be pleasantly placed towards yourself. After all we are human beings and if we make mistakes it’s all right. It’s okay. We’re not God so please don’t feel guilty. I feel everybody has problem [UNCLEAR in us.] And that that causes problem so why feel guilty? All right, so it’s a very easy thing that we’ll have. Only things you may have to help your centres a little bit and also in your house you can always practise it. So I’ll tell you how to do it by first put your left hand towards me, like this, comfortably. If it does not; yes take out your shoes please. If he doesn’t want it you can go, you see. [UNCLEAR Whoever doesn’t want to]...yeah yeah, it’s better yeah. Or else you do it. It’s very simple. So you cannot force anyone. Your freedom is respected. I cannot force [UNCLEAR but] I cannot force her. Your freedom is respected. To achieve the absolute freedom, I have to respect your freedom. [UNCLEAR All right] so now with your left hand towards me it means symbolically this is the power of desire, about which I’ll tell you tomorrow, that you want your Self Realization. And the right hand has got the power of action so we have to use the right hand on our different chakras which I’ll show you on the centres on different centres which I’ll show you one by one. And both the feet should be apart from each other because these are two powers we have to work separately. And you have to be comfortably seated. There should be no discomfort. Supposing something is tied; you can make yourself comfortable is the point. So and also that there should not be any tension in the body or slouching but just in the normal way straight as we sit. All right so please put left hand towards me it’s very relaxing to begin with. All right so put the right hand on your heart. Now in your heart resides as I told you the Spirit. On the left hand side on the upper part of the portion of your stomach we have to press it here is the centre of your mastery. We you need not write. We have got books and you can take them home and can understand everything. They need not write about it. We have got books. We can, you get your Realization. There are books. Now, then we have to put our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of Pure Knowledge which manifest on your central nervous system. [UNCLEAR For] Sanskrit it’s called as bodha bodhaa and that’s why he’s called as Buddha. To know it on your central nervous system. Like a feeling. Like cold and hot. All right, now we take back our hand on to the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Now we take our right hand then on to our heart again. Now we have to take our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder and turn our head to the right. Now this is the centre is caught up when we feel guilty and it’s very dangerous because this gives you diseases like spondylitis and angina and so many others.

Translator:...angina?

It’s the heart. Now so don’t feel guilty at all for anything whatsoever. All right now this hand has to go on top of your forehead and you have to press it on both the sides. This is the centre where you have to forgive. Now this centre also on the backside you put your right hand on it and push your head back to rest on it like this. Now stretch your hand and the center of your palm please put it on top of your fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone like this and push back your fingers. Now press it hard your scalp and you have to move it seven times clockwise, your scalp slowly. Seven times. Push back, push back your fingers. Push back your fingers otherwise there’s no pressure. Now we have to now close our eyes and we have to take out our spectacles also if possible. And please please don’t open your eyes till I tell you because the attention is drawn inside better. Now so please put your left hand towards me and right hand on your heart and please close your eyes. Here now you have to ask me a very fundamental question. You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother whichever you like. “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this question three times. Now if you are the Spirit, your are your master so please take your right hand upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Now please ask me a question again three times, “Mother, am I my own master?” Now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Press it hard. Here again I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge upon you. So here you have to ask for Pure Knowledge so please say, “Shri Mataji, give me pure knowledge.” You have to say this six times because this centre has got six petals. When you say this your Kundalini starts moving upward so now you have to help the higher centres with your self-confidence...

...So now please raise your right hand [UNCLEAR, in] the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Press it hard and here with full confidence you have to say to open this centre fully, “Shri Mataji, I am my own master.” Say this ten times. Now the greatest truth about you is that you are the Spirit, not this body not this mind not this ego not the conditionings. So now raise your right hand on your heart again and here you say with full confidence, “Mother” or “Shri Mataji, I am the Spirit.” Twelve times. Say it with full confidence. Say it twelve times. Now one has to know that the Divine is the ocean of bliss and joy. It is the ocean of peace but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness so you cannot do any mistakes which this ocean cannot dissolve. So you can raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck as back as possible and put your neck to your head towards the right side. Here you have to say with full confidence in yourself, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Say it sixteen times please. If you still feel guilty then you punish yourself by saying it 108 times. I’ve told you you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself and respect yourself. Now raise your hand onto your forehead across and bend your head and press it on both the sides. Here from your heart you have to say not how many times from your heart you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Everywhere I go I find people have not forgiven so they don’t feel the cool breeze. Then I have to go on asking them again and again and then it works. I have to work very hard for them so I would request you all from your heart to say “Mother I forgive everyone.” Now say it from your heart. Now take your right hand on the back-side of your head and put your head on top of it. Here you have to say for your own satisfaction, not feeling guilty not counting your mistakes “Oh Divine if we have done any mistakes please forgive.” Say it from your heart. Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm on top of your head and bend your head. Here also I cannot force self-realisation on you so you have to say seven times, “Mother, please give me self-realisation”, while moving your hand slowly on your scalp and your fingers stretched outward....

...stretch, stretch back...

...stretch...

...but stretch the fingers and press it hard...and move it clockwise.

(Shri Mataji blows air on the microphone)

Now take down your hands please. Slowly open your eyes. Please put both the hands towards me. Please open your eyes slowly. Now put the right hand towards me and bend your head and see for yourself there’s a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone. Some might get hot but after some time it will cool down. Some might get it much away from their heads. Now put your left hand, right hand, left hand towards me like this and put the right hand on top of your head and see again bending your head. Now again with the right hand towards me [unclear] and the left hand you see if there’s a cool breeze. You should have bent your head. Now raise both your hands and push back your head and ask the question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the Divine power of God? Mother is this the Brahmachaitanya?”. Ask this question three times. Now take down your hands....Now...watch me without thinking. You can do it. All those who have felt cool breeze in their hands or out of their head please raise both your hands. [UNCLEAR, The whole of it, The whole lot].

I knew the Greeks. So may God bless you. We’ll meet again tomorrow and also you will find when you go home a twinkle in your eye, a light in your eyes. And you can feel each other’s, you can feel each other’s, each other’s. Those who have not felt it will feel tomorrow....or...or can come this side.
