Evening Program Guru Puja, Cabella Italy 18th July 1997.

Sorry, we started the program late and My watch was one hour late because I didn't change from London. So, whatever is there, we must accept it in Sahaja manner.

Now today, Babamama has already told you about Rahul, son of [UNCLEAR Nargita] but also I have to tell you a boy from Canada, who is the son of Dr. Mishra, who stood first in the whole world in GMAT exam, which is a very difficult exam. Since we started our school, people have been after our lives and have troubled us a lot. But in the final exam of ICSE, which is the highest exam, you have to appear before going to college. In India, in the whole of India, the girl who stood first is from our school, Radha. And there are, there were eight candidates for this exam from our school, all of them got first class. It has happened to many people that they have achieved a lot of success in Sahaja Yoga and also in their lives.

Now, there are some people who can tell you how they have got better jobs and better jobs and higher jobs. You know our Dave from America, he's got a very big job now in Singapore, where he is going to be a partner of that company. I don't know what has done that good to them, but as far as Dave is concerned, I know he's a very humble, dedicated Sahaja Yogi. And the first day I met him, he was just crying. I said, why are you crying? He said, why didn't I meet you before this? And throughout I've seen him such a humble and such an effective leader, such a good person. But how now he's blessed one after another. Before him there was a leader who was not so good. I didn't like him very much, but what to do, there was nobody to take up, so I said, all right, go ahead. But suddenly that fellow turned out to be even more rude than before and we didn't know what to do with him. And luckily that the moment Dave got transferred and he came to Los Angeles and that's how he could become the leader. Just imagine how Sahaja works out things for me also and solves my problems also. So I don't know how many more successful people are here sitting.I think we must make a list of these and have to put them in the cool breeze so everybody will know what they have achieved by coming to Sahaja Yoga.

May God bless you all.
