Interviewer [speaks in French]: She is known in India as the greatest woman of these days. She comes to propose to Westerners as well as to Orientals a new stage in their conscience which was promised by Jesus-Christ himself. We can ask Shri Mataji how to achieve this new state of conscience and what will it bring to us? 
Marie: The question is how to reach this new state of consciousness and what will t bring us? 
Shri Mataji: This new state of consciousness, to begin with, should be called as Collective Consciousness and I should be achieved spontaneously. 
You don’t have to exert, you don’t have to pay for it, it is spontaneously happening, f there is somebody who knows how to awaken the residual power called Kundalini within you. 

Interviewer [speaks in French]: Très bien, on peut aussi se poser la question de savoir comment se manifeste ce nouvel état de conscience si, dans le passé déjà,  des personnes en ont parlé dans notre civilisation, aussi bien que dans d’autres civilisations. 
Marie: Now, how does this awareness manifest itself, and what have been the manifestations of awareness in the past, now, as there have been people who have manifested this awareness.
Shri Mataji: In the tradition of spirituality, it has been happening for thousands of years. But in the beginning of time, the tree of life had few flowers which became the fruits. But I called this time the blossom time where many flowers have to become the fruits. 

The manifestation of this new awareness takes place because the Spirit, that is the reflection of the Divine with you, starts manifesting in your attention. Firstly you become, again I say you become collectively conscious, means you start feeling the other people on your fingertips, their centres, the subtle centres, and you start feeling your subtle centres also on your fingertips.

Now the collective consciousness of attention is so powerful that sitting down here, you can feel the vibrations or the state of another person anywhere in the world and also you should get the power to cure the problems of the other person who is far away. Like through ether we can hear the radio anywhere, with just the subtler of the ether by which we know about anyone in the whole world any person, but not only that we can know about that person, but we can become effective, we can help this person thought the subtle side of the ether. As you start growing in the experience of the Spirit, you become so powerful that you can overcome all your problems, physical, mental, emotional, you get rid of all your temptations ad get rid of your bad habits.
