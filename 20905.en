Interview on Radio Enghien, Marie Rouger’s flat, Enghien, suburbs of Paris (France), Septembre 29th, 1984
29/09/1984

Interviewer [speaks in French]: She is known in India as the greatest woman of these days. She comes to propose to Westerners as well as to Orientals a new stage in their conscience which was promised by Jesus-Christ himself. We can ask Shri Mataji how to achieve this new state of conscience and what will it bring to us? 
Marie: The question is how to reach this new state of consciousness and what will t bring us? 
Shri Mataji: This new state of consciousness, to begin with, should be called as Collective Consciousness and I should be achieved spontaneously. 
You don’t have to exert, you don’t have to pay for it, it is spontaneously happening, f there is somebody who knows how to awaken the residual power called Kundalini within you. 

Interviewer [speaks in French]: Très bien, on peut aussi se poser la question de savoir comment se manifeste ce nouvel état de conscience si, dans le passé déjà,  des personnes en ont parlé dans notre civilisation, aussi bien que dans d’autres civilisations. 
Marie: Now, how does this awareness manifest itself, and what have been the manifestations of awareness in the past, now, as there have been people who have manifested this awareness.
Shri Mataji: In the tradition of spirituality, it has been happening for thousands of years. But in the beginning of time, the tree of life had few flowers which became the fruits. But I called this time the blossom time where many flowers have to become the fruits. 

The manifestation of this new awareness takes place because the Spirit, that is the reflection of the Divine with you, starts manifesting in your attention. Firstly you become, again I say you become collectively conscious, means you start feeling the other people on your fingertips, their centres, the subtle centres, and you start feeling your subtle centres also on your fingertips.

Now the collective consciousness of attention is so powerful that sitting down here, you can feel the vibrations or the state of another person anywhere in the world and also you should get the power to cure the problems of the other person who is far away. Like through ether we can hear the radio anywhere, with just the subtler of the ether by which we know about anyone in the whole world any person, but not only that we can know about that person, but we can become effective, we can help this person thought the subtle side of the ether. As you start growing in the experience of the Spirit, you become so powerful that you can overcome all your problems, physical, mental, emotional, you get rid of all your temptations and get rid of your bad habits. 

But this is the power of compassion and love of the Divine. So, though you become very powerful, you become very sublime, very righteous and virtuous.  You do not have a mental projection about compassion but through you, you achieve compassionate acts, as if when you are with other people, they feel the peace and the bliss. And also, you can cure other people without difficulties. 
You start feeling the joy and the peace of the Spirit. And then gradually you grow into a being who becomes the source of joy and peace. In short, this is the epitome of our evolutionary process which is living. Because it is a living process, it happens spontaneously. It is beyond all imaginary, mental processes. 
You become very dynamic and also very knowledgeable because the Spirit is the source of all the real knowledge. Human being is a fantastic instrument and this fantastic instrument has to be worked out so that we can know how and why a human being has been created. And also through this process of evolution, one can find meaning to many things which are being denied by mental processes. Only thing is, by this happening, the instrument is connected to the mains.

Interviewer [speaks in French]: It looks really fascinating but how to believe it? It looks really quite incredible. It is true that since thousands of years, all the great personalities of humanity, the Christ, Muhammad, every one has talked about this Advent, of a new state of awareness, of perfection, but how to know, to believe that it is the event that you are talking about? That it is the truth, the achievement. How to believe it, what are the proofs of it? 
Marie: It’s true that every body has spoken about this coming, this Realization. Mohamed and Christ have spoken and said that there was a new opening that something was coming, but how to believe that it’s really this, this is it? 
Shri Mataji: Whatever happens to you on your central nervous system is what you achieve in your evolution. For example if there’s a dog, and if you ask the dog to go through a dirty lane, it can go but a human being cannot go because on our central nervous system we can feel the filth. 
With this transformation you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area, you can feel it actually. Ad then from your hands, you can feel the cool breeze flowing and all around you, you can feel the existence of the Power of Divine as cool breeze, you can feel it on your central nervous system. And many people, overnight, get transformed into sublime and good people. It is not possible, unless and until there is something like the transformation of an egg into a bird has taken place. 

Interviewer [speaks in French]: It is interesting to know that Shri Mataji will give 2 public program on Friday, September the 28th and Saturday 29th, means tonight, 5 rue Lascase Paris 07, à 20h, metro Station: Solférino.

Another interviewer [speaks in French]: Shri Mataji, is it possible for everyone, for each one of us, to get access to this Yoga or is it for a special elite? 
Marie: The question is: is this Yoga accessible for every body or is it only for an elite? 
Shri Mataji: It is for everyone.
