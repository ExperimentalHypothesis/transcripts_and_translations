Public Program Day 1. New York (USA), 19 September 1981.

It’s nice to come back to America. I know there are lots of seekers in this country; lost. They are frantically seeking, no doubt. The are genuine seekers, I have no doubt about it. I came back after 9 years; it was unfortunate because I was busy with other parts of the world and I knew I’d find them again when I came back.

It is for us to know first of all that if you are seeking reality, if you are seeking the truth, we have to be very honest about it; extremely honest. You have to know that unless and until you find it, you should not believe anyone., You should nbot accept any surface anything. People may say anything. I may tell you that you have to have your realization. That doesn’t mean that you have to believe me – it doesn’t mean that at all. But you should not also deny me.

Now, first of all we should know what we are seeking. There has been never on this earth such an urge to seek. So many seekers! I don’t know if you understand that a really different type of category of people – I call them men of God – are born who are seekers. And they will go on seeking until they find the truth. But one has to know what we are seeking. What are we to seek? It is said you have to become. You have to be. What do we have to be?

We have to be our Spirit. Now we do not know what our Spirit is. The Spirit exists, no doubt. It watches us. We know there is a Spirit. But how to bring that Spirit into our conscious mind – into our central nervous system – is the point. And when people know that there are such demands, the market also gets filled with enterprise . . . is very common. Americans have the worst hit because you have worse . . . you have money. That is the worst part of it. And that’s how all of them are different down here and they have exploited you.

I’m sorry for all that. But I must tell you that you cannot pay for your realization. It’s an insult of God. How can you pay? How can you p[ay for His love? Do you pay to a tree when it gives you fruit? You do not. Maybe a merchant might take a fruit and settle. It’s much more than that. “How can we pay for it?” Is a simple question we should ask ourselves; honestly.

Then second point is, you cannot have courses in God realization. What university did Christ go? He was a simple man. Did he go to any university? There is no understanding for us. That God is for everyone, whether you are rich people or not. Whether you understand this language or that language, God’s language is of love and it’s for everyone… every person….for every case. It cannot be for one person or one type of people or of one category. But one category is there and they are the seekers. Seekers is a special category; but only trouble is they do not know what they are seeking.

For this we have to divert to some authentic people. For example, we should see now Christ. Christ said that you are to be born again. Last time, when I came to America, they were taping my speeches and all that in Los Angeles. And I was amazed, you see, that poeple objected to it; felt they should not tape. I said, “Let them tape. What does it matter?” They said, “No Mother, they will publish it.” I said, “Let them publish it. It’s a fact. They should get it. They should get their relization. They are to be born again.”

But I was amazed! Then, they write books as if that was their knowledge. I don’t mind that either. But saying that you are to be born again and they got a certificate – a sales certificate – that we are born again. How can you certify yourslf you are born again? You have to be honest about it. If you are born again something special has to happen to us. Like Jung has said that you have to become – become collectively conscious. Not that I say we are all brothers and sisters and we are all one. No, you have to become that part and parcel of the whole – as you say the microcosm. You have to become this microcosm . . . has to become that. That means in evolution, your awareness has to become something more. As an animal you see, for example, for an animal. He doesn’t see any colors. He doesn’t see whether is filthy or good. But you do. I’m the same way, if you have to rise higher, the change has to come in your awareness. That is one thing one should know . . . that the transformation has to take place in your awareness. And that is what one should see. Is there any transformation in awareness? For example, there is some lady who starts jumping on the seat. I’ve seen some poeple who come to me. They just start jumping and they think they have got realization. How can that be? You are not in possession of yourself. You have to be your own master. Here somebody is making you jump. Maybe you are possessed.You have not have authority over yourself. You do not know how to control yourself. And how do you say that you have got realization? If you become self realized, you are not going to be enslaved. You are going to get over all

kinds of slavery. You have to be a master. This should be the test of anything that you are seeking. What have you got, you say? Are you emitting your own powers? I may say (as he has said it, I mean, I don’t know why Warren said this because I seldom start with this kind of a thing); but if you wanted to see who said it. Now to say that I am such and such and such and such is nonsense. I may be anything. So what? What did you get is the point! Did you feel yourself any more than before? Did you get anthing more than you have had before? Not that you become crazy people or recluses. That’s not the way. You are going to become most normal person . . . has to be extremely normal. And above all, you have to have complete control of yourself. That is the minimum of minimums one should know. But our idea about self realization is so much spoiled and so many psuedo people have written., even about Kundalini. I was amazed when I found out that such big, big books are written about Kundalini. . . saying it is in the stomache, some say it is in the nose. . . it is here and there. It is not there! It is in the sacrum bone. You can see it yourself with your own eyes. When the Kundalini rises you can see the pulsation just like a heart. . . not in everyone, of course. But in some poeple who have had an obstruction, you can see with your naked eyes. You should be able to see it – happily – and you can also feel the pulsation coming to the head. I mean so many pleople have said it.

There are people now, I am told, who are converting people into Shikhism and this and that. And what is Shikhism? If you need , read Kabir (sp ?) who is the basis of Shikhism. He has said that you have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. He says . . . . (Mother quotes in another language). This means, on the head first of all, there is the sound of Anahada, is this thub-dub of the heart and then you feel the cool breeze coming out. Is so clearly said, but who reads those people? Those people who talk even of Hinduism and all that, do they read Adi Shankaracharia? What Adi Shankaracharin has said? He has written books after books on Kundalini; and not only, but on this Chaintanyita (sp?) he has written a complete book. But people don’t read that. You get these – I don’t know – extracts and some sort of a – I don’t know how they are not afraid of God? They are not afraid – just to make some money – I don’t know. Are they going to carry this money with them? It’s very, very wrong! It’s very sinful. I don’t mind what ever they do. It’s alright if they want to be smugglers and all. There are many like that. But they spoil your Kundalini. You are damaged. And this is the thing which I am concernd about. It’s a very sad thing.

Coming to America is a real _____? for me because I did send some of the people who were really realized sould and they came here. They ran away within 3 days. They said they will never recognize us . . . there is a barrier . . . there is a barrier. They will never recognize Mother. They rushed back. They stayed in New York, one of them stayed. He ran away. He couldn’t stand it. He said, “They just want something else. They don’t want Ìod. They don’t want their spirit.” Of course, I don’t believe that. These barriers are created to us because we read about it. We try to understand through reading. It’s good, but you must come to a right conclusion through logical, logical understanding; not rationality. Rationality is something which can take you anywhere. Rationality can give you . . . (you can) rationalize even a murder . . . anything! But, logically, you must understnd. Where should we reach? What should happen to us? As seekers, what are we expecting? This is a very, very precarious and important time . . . is more to say. The Last Judgement has started. That has started. That’s how you are all here and you are seeking. The way it will judge, is the Kundalini has to rise. Your have to become self realized. Then you start feeling your centers on your fingers.

Tomorrow I will give you all the information about the centers and all that and I will tell you how He will judge you. What are your centers that are catching? And then you will judge that and you will know what is the problem. . . how to get it done . . . how to get it alright. There is no technique for _____? . Like if you sow a seed it becomes a tree. There is no technique. If you have flowers, they become a fruit. It’s a living thing. And living things don’t have any technique. But once you get connected, then you must know the Divine laws and you must know the Divine technique. But first you must be realized. Unless and until you are put to the Mains, how can you use this machine¿ You are not yet put to the Mains. How can you do anything? It’s like telephoning somewhere without having connection. You must be connected., first of all to the Divine.( but this is not a difficult thing.). In modern times is very easy. Formerly, it was, like you can say, a tree. In the beginning you get only one or two flowers. But the time has come. The blossom time has come.

Already today, I went to see William Blake’s drawing exhibition. And he said, “All your sins and blasphemy and everything will be forgiven. All your sins will be forgiven.” He has said about these days. He said that the God of _____? will become prophets and they will have power to convert and transform others into prophets. He has clearly prophesized about Sahaja Yoga. Every word he has said about it. But people don’t read Blake. If you go

and see his exhibition, you’ll be surprised how in the “Pilgrim’s Progress” only he has given clearly how you face life. And there are some Sahjaja Yogis here sitting down at your back here. And they have come from London and some of them from Australia. And they could see. This is how you face it. But to get realization is the easiest thing; to maintain it . . . rather difficult. But also that is possible.

Now we have in London (you will be surprised) a hall at least one and one-half times bigger than this. And the hall was completely filled. And they rose up to sing a song of Jeruseleum which was a great experience for me to see that. But( you won’t believe) I started the work in England because my husband got elected to a post there. That’s how we were there. And in the beginning, I was working with seven people – seven hippies, I should say . . . seven people for four years. And now of course, in the whole of England we have many centers and lots of people have got realization and they are working it out. It’s working out very well.

We have some people here from there who have come. Dr. David is here and Hesta is a barrister. Then we have these two from Australia – Dr. Warren, who was a diplomat. And these two are American girls – both of them – ah Christine – has been with me since long and Marcia who got her realization only two months back, but she was so upright and so straight forward. And you should know that it is you who should decide. If you say I am your Guru, alright I accept it for the time being. But a Mother is always a guru. If you say that your mother had to teach you so many things – also I have to teach you some things. But actually, it is you who is your own guru. You have to become it. Unless and until you are connected, how will you judge? Once you get connected, you will be able to check. But you don’t think it is a mental activity that is going to bring you your realization. No, God has placed everything beautifully within us ; everything. You have got your Kundalini very nicely placed in the sacrum bone. Now, see this bone. Sacrum is a triangular bone called “sacrum” so that Greeks know about this bone. They knew it was a sacred bone. Sacrum means sacred in Greek. When I went to Greece, I was surprised. They have the complete idea of kundalini; complete idea. And they have this Athena also . . . means the Primordial Mother. In Sanskrit language, Athena – Athens comes from that and the way She was holding a serpent in her hand and everything – absolutely She is the Primordial Kundalini. And the whole concept was there and when I went into the study of that I tried to find out what it was. . . how did they know? They said we had some Indo-Aryian groups coming down here and they told us these things and that’s how they know about it. But, that was all lost

because they brought all the Gods to the level of human beings and made alot of mess out of it.

Now we have to know that how Christ was such an important incarnation on this earth. We have really made a mess of the whole thing. He said that you are to be born again. Actually, he came on this center where you see this red mark. You see – it is placed in the optic chiasma. In the center is a subtle center called as Agnya chakra. In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Mahavishnu. But I will tell about His advent when He came on this earth. We say, He is the gate; he is the door. He is the door below the limbic area. And the limbic area is the Kingdom of God. Where one has to center, the attention has to enter. How you enter into it ? Not bodily, but your attention has to enter it. Your attention is apread out in this area. But not there – it has to enter through that area into the limbic area and ultimately, is the fontanel area. It becomes soft and the kundalini has to come out and with the cool breeze, this is your actual baptism. Is not the baptism you go to some theological college to learn and say alright – I baptize – it’s all artifical. It’s absolutely artificial. That’s not the way you can baptize. You have to be a realized soul to do that. John the Baptist was a realized soul. He was the one who knew how to do it. And he did it for all of them. And that’s how it should happen to you. The kundalini has to rise and give you realization. Now the Christ advent came at this point. It’s a very important one because today we have brought the charts and all that but tomorrow we’ll be giving you, in a full way, how the ego and super-ego are sucked. They create a barrier here. Our ego and super-ego gives us our I-ness. We get seperated. When He’s awakened, this portion gets opened out and then the kundalini can rise. That’s why it is said, Christ is to be awakened within you. But it can be only done by a person with Divine authority. And such a person cannot live on your money. He cannot be a parasite. Such a person has nothing to do wioth money. How can you purchase such a person.? Such a person is beyond. . . beyond your purchase . . . beyond your money. You cannot do anything for such a person. Such a person just gives. He just gives. He emits. It cannot take anything. It cannot receive. It cannot! You may try, but doesn’t. One day I was walking a little bit, my foot was a little twisted and one of the doctors she said, “Alright Mother, I’ll try to massage it.” Yet she was relaxing that side and I was saying, “What’s happening to you?” She said, “Mother, what is this? Lots of vibrations are coming and I am just massaging yourself and I am massaging myself. . . the way it is cooling down and soothing.” So, such a person cannot take anythging from you.

Now, the most important point which I would like to reach you is this: that we don’t realize hos precariously we are placed otherwise, also. There are equal and opposite forces working on us. For example, a disease like cancer. I was surprised to hear at this country, theere are patients . . . one among four . . . of cancer disease. I have told this ten years back, that cancer can only be cured through Sahaja Yoga. There’s no other way out. I have cured many cancer patients and you can also cure once you get realized. How it happens . . . how you cure cancer . . . all this knowledte you can have . . . free of charge. Free of this thing. Actually, first you must get your realization. Without that, there is no use telling you because you come into this room; it is all dark; you are blind; you cannot see anything. What’s the use telling you the size of the room, and color of the chairs, and color of all this? No use telling you. Best thing is to open the lights and open your eyes so that you can see for yourself. And the complete knowledge becomes your own. Then is better to talk. Otherwise supposing even though when you can’t see, I go on giving you the complete history about electricity and about everything. You’ll be bored and stiff. And its of no use. First thing is you must get your realization. That is the first thing. Cancer can easily be cured by Sahaja Yoga. Absolustely there is no doubt. And there cannot be another doubt that it cannot be cured by anything else.

In our body, we have a particular system called as a sympathetic nervous system. How this sympathetic nervous system goes into a terrible tension when we go to extremes of any kind. Say smoking, for example. Now smoking is a very interesting thing. According to me, this America is the Visshuddi chakra. . . is the center of this çenter. This center gets spoiked when we smoke and the smoking is the maximum here. Like the Europe is the liver and there people drink. And they are so much in it and their lives are the worst of all in Europe. England is the heart. It (England) is lethargic. I mean the whole thing is in such a mess that I don’t know what I have to face. But I was happy to know that now the smoking is going down. But with realization, smoking just disappears. You don’t have to work at it. Marsha herself used to smoke alot. She told me. I was amazed. But she has biven up completely. Drugs and all those things drop out just like something unnecessary because a transformation takes place. And the transmutation starts . . . when the transmutation starts, all these things drop out. You enjoy the best of health . . . best of your heart . . . best of your miond. . . and your emotions come out. The best part of it is that this is what one has to achieve. . . the whole humanity has to achieve. But the few who are the seekers have to do it first. They have to do it first; they are the foundation. Like in every evolution, only a few fishes had to come out; then many came

out. In the same way, few people have to do it. I’m happy there are a few today. Though others are disappointed, I am not. I am happy because I’ll have to work harder. If there are too many, maybe difficult. As he said, it’s true that I gave realization to six thousand people in a village in India. But they are not complicated. See, they aren’t so complicated. They don’t live with the sorrows (word?) you have here or the tensions you have. . . or the litigations you have. . . the problems you have. I have seen Indians who have come here to earn money. They have all gone off their heads. I mean really, they have become half crazy.

The gentleman with whom I am now putting up, he told me already so many Indians have been under litigation. This happened, that happened and all kinds of tensions are building up. Here, despite all our modern vest(word?) we also have landed ourselves into terrible tensions of this machinery; this machinate and all that. The villagers in India are extremely simple people. They lead an extremely simple life. They have no complications. I won’t say that it would be so easy here as the way they have got realization. Of course, one has to work hard. Like we had about seven people. I had all of them . It took about three hours to get realization. So, it could be that way also. It cannot be guaranteed; it cannot be promised. It cannot be certified. It has to happen . . . is the main point . . . is the happening . . . is the happening. You have to become. It has to be actualized. It is not to be believed. That’s what you should know. If you are honest, you are to prove. And, you want to have it, you’ll get it. I’ll work very hard. It’s you who has to have patience with yourself. I have all the patience and love. No doubt about it. But you all have to have patience. I told you seven people I was working for four years. Suppose its not going to be that bad, because with them I worked out many permutations and combinations. Now, I know all the permutations and combinations that are really harmful to people and how they are eradicated. But still I would say I would still have to study some American complications which I do not know.

Nine years back, people were simpler people here and they are all mostly have gone away or also at that time the same thing is that I could not contact and everything works on money. You see you have to give them money so they publisize you. Then they publisize you , then you get more money. Here there is no question of money, you see. You see my whole basic thing is you have to get real people so the real thing, without money. And then, you cannot have a big circus; you cannot have a big thing and it has to be started in a genuine way . . . in a real way. They asked me that there is, there are agencies who work out all these tings. I said to begin with I don’t think that

this is important. We should work it out. Let’s see. There will be some people who feel attracted and come. And let’s work it out this way. Still, I would like your advice as to where we can go, when, and in a decent manner whenever we can advertise. Just now a lady told us that if you go to these shops it will be good idea.

We would like to invite people for this experience. This is your right. You are seekers and just like a bank, you have got your bank accounts and you just cash it. And these are lots of places also. And whatever mistakes are done, don’t worry about it. One of the big problems I faced in Englad is that they all suffer from a center or left visshuddi which comes out of guilt. You see, they are guilty all the time. Maybe Catholicism that makes them feel guilty, but it’s a very, very common trouble with them. They all the time feel guilty. Now, what are you feeling guilty for? We must suffer. Why? Why should you suffer? Christ has suffered for you. Did he leave anything for you to suffer? We whould be guilty about what? Why are you guilty? I’m talking of ocean of compassion . . . ocean of love. Now what guilt can you have? And is a very big mistake to think that we have done little mistake here and little mistake there. God has to save this creation. It is He who has to come in compassion and has to do something about it. If He doesn’t save you, his creation is lost. You shouldn’t feel like that inb a small way. It’s all very childish, I would say, like a child to feel “Oow” after this mistake. But no . . . your Father is so great, is so full of love you have to just look at Him and He’ll work it out. You should forgive yourself; that is one of the things I would request of you. First of all, before forgiving anybody else, you must forgive yourself. That is the first thing you have to do before realization. Of course, in one lecture, I cannot tell you much about it. This is just an introductory lecture. And we haven’t got our charts and all that because first day, if you start seeing the charts, you (word?) mechanical and you think it’s some sort of a computer. You work it out. Actually, you are a computer, you become a Divine computer. But that’s a different system and so it’s better that we talk about it just now. And you get your realization; work it out. We are going to be here for some time and I hope you’ll be able to follow my lectures and follow the whole thing. It’s such a tremendous thing. I must tell you about this in five hundred ( 500 ) lectures in London . . . at least . . . minimum. I say that every time I speak. They say, “Mother, you are speaking something now.” So, you can imagine how much knowledge there is there. But you are knowledge; you become knowledge yourself. In Australia, the newspaper people were very good to me because there was some happening. A lady was very seriously ill

and she had some sort of a very serious stroke and a friend of hers was a big man at the newspapers and one of the Sahaja Yoginis there gave my photograph to her. And she did get well from that . . . from the photograph only. So, this man started thinking about it and then they did a big publicity for me. So, it was lucky ,I should say, for Australians and I was there for about one month or so . . . three weeks. And we got thousands there now . . . thousands. There are seven cities where we have seven centers. It has worked. I must say, Australians are very good for realization. It was surprising because certain people got realization and settled down and they knew it was the trugh. That was the thing. YTou have to be intelligent enough to see what i8s the truth. Don’t allow your intelligence to cheat you. Be careful about your intelligence . . . also, it can cheat you. But you should be really sharp about it to see what is the truth. And wise. And that is what you are going to have.

Now, I would request you to ask me questions because you see you all must be having lots of questions. You have your mind and you should better ask because I don’t want whild we are giving you realization that you should feel that, “Oh, I didn’t ask this question to Mother,” . . . ‘though this makes no difference whether you ask me questions or not. It is a very different thing. It is beyond your mind. You go beyond your mind. You go beyond your mind; beyond your ego; beyond your super-ego. You become something else. So if you have any questions, you can ask.

Question: There are many people who come offering realization. You come offering realization. I would like to know something about this. In other words, you have something unique to offer, is that right?

Yes, of course I would say I don’t know how many have come here and how many have been thugs and how many have been real. But, actually most of them have been thugs only because what they offer you . . . I don’t know . . . I have had people from other gurus . . . all kinds of gurus you see. And there are one or two sitting here. All of them have been to someone or something like that. Now as I told you, the uniqueness of Sahaja Yoga is this: Sahaja means . . . “Saha” is with; “ja” is born . . . is born with you. . . is your own. . . within you. Now the uniqueness about it is this: that it is what you are seeking. That’s what you are going to get. . . is your spirit. . . is that you become that . . . is the uniqueness. It’s not that I can say there is a course of

ten days . . . you go through the course or you pay for say a jumping course or a so-called flying course or something like that. It is what you are. You become that. The uniqueness of it is that it’s a happening which is a living happening. You see, we don’t do anything that is a living work. What we do is a dead work. Like a tree died; we make chairs; we think we have achieved alot. You see this wall is all made of dead things, isn’t it? We have just changed the form. And these forms actually try to dominate us. This chair becomes a sort of an obsession for us because we can’t sit on the ground. . . this . . . we have to use a chair like that.

Now, anything that we do is all dead. Supposing somebody has to jump. Anybody can jump., What is there to be jumping? People pay money to jump. Can you imagine? . . . to take off clothes? . . . people pay money. How can that be? What is so great about it? We must understand: what do we become? What powers do we become? You see, there’s a guru. He says, “Alright, I give you some knowledge.” Now, what knowledge has he got?

One gentleman came. He said, “I’ve already got knowledge.” I said, “What knowledge do you have?” For example, Warren can tell you where is your chakra catching. Where is your kundalini; where it is obstructed; how to raise it; how to bring it us; how to take it down. The he can cure patients. He must have cured . . . I don’t know how many. You all can cure patientes and knowingly . . . what it is. What chakra is catching . . . what is happening . . . what is the mental process. Everything, you know in your awareness. You become a different person . . . is a transformation that takes place. You become master of yourself. To explain, I will tell you a very simple anology. Say we are traveling by. . . we are trying to learn how to drive. Now you have got an accelerator and you have got a brake. You’re working it out. You see one, then another. ( We have two centers . . . two channels within us which I show tomorrow . . . one for our actions.) So we start working both of these and start managing. We go to extremes. . . this way . . . that way . . . and make all kinds of mistakes . . . whatever it is . . . but we try to balance ourselves. When do we learn the car driving? When we learn it. Once you have done that there the Master is . . . sitting at the back. And once He sees you have balanced it, He gives you your place. You become the master of your being. This is what has to happen. . . the breakthrough! The breakthrough has to take place. Is not just a make believe that, “Oh, we have become like this.” I mean there are people who believe they are self realized. There are many like that, you see, that believe that they are that. They are not. Because they should be able to tell. They should become collectively conscious. They should be able to tell where is the kundalini; where is the problem. Now, for

example, you are sitting. . . alright, now you do not know about the gentleman next to you . . . where is the problem? Where is his kundalini? You cannot give him realization. But the people who are realized souls – even the small children – can do it . . . very small children. They will immediately say, “This is the center catching. Here . . . the finger . . . little children will show the same finger. For example, if you have a problem, say on this center. Alright. All the children you put some sort of a thing to close their eyes. And ask them, “Which center is catching?” They’ll all say this. All will say the same thing. And they also know how to correct this. Little, little children know how to correct this. They are born realized and born realized children are dynamic. And they know . . . so many born-realized children are born these days. How will you know whether they are born realized children? You do not know who is a false guru and who is a real guru. You don’t know anything! There’s no discrimination power. But, if you want to know also about that, you can just put the hands towards them and they can find out. Your vibrations will vanish completely. You’ll have heat coming from horrible gurus. If you see any horrible guru, you’ll find very bad vibrations coming in that . . . all burning and some of them just stop the vibrations. You just don’t get any vibrations from them. You can make it out from everyone what sort of a person he is.
