頂輪 Sahasrara Chakra

1983年2月4日 德里

 Today is the last day in this pendal and today I’ll be telling you about the last centre of Sahasrara.
They are all coming. If I come late it is better, I think [Laughing]. Still I was quite late I was thinking. Do you think this is needed on the eyes so much or are you not getting my picture just? This one if you could little bit push it the other way. This one is too much. That’s thank you. 

今天我會講關於最後一個輪穴­_____頂輪。頂輪在大腦邊緣系統處。我們的頭腦像一個椰子。椰子有鬚毛、跟著是硬殼,然後是黑色包裹,內層是白肉。這是椰子的外殼,內裡是椰水。人腦同樣是這樣構造,故人腦稱為“Shriphal”,椰子是生果中的“Shri”力量,Shri 的力量是右邊的力量,左邊的力量是 Lalita。我們有兩個輪穴,左邊是月輪 Lalita,右邊是日輪 Shri Chakra。這兩個輪穴的工作在右邊是摩訶莎維德麗(Mahasawasrati)的力量,左邊是摩訶迦利(Mahakali)的力量。中間的力量則是靈量。靈量要在中脈上昇,昇到大腦的邊緣系統,然後啟發在其下面的所有輪穴。靈量穿越六個輪穴,然後啟發大腦的七個輪穴的寶座(Pithas)。寶座在大腦邊緣系統(limbic area)中部,大腦後部代表根輪的部分先受啟發,跟著是真知輪、臍輪、心輪、喉輪、額輪,最後這六個輪穴連成一起,成為頂輪。這是十分重要的,日輪在右邊工作,月輪在左邊工作。若靈量不上昇,我們的腦袋只能作用於右邊的肉身及心智活動。我們的大腦作用於右邊,此所以人腦稱為 Shripal。

頂輪實際上是整合了下面的六個輪穴,頂輪上有一千條經脈(神經線),當光穿進邊緣系統,這些經脈就會得到啟發,你可看見經脈像火燄,十分柔和地燃燒,這些光燄有七種顏色,最後像水晶般清澈。我們頂輪有一千塊花瓣。若我們將大腦橫切或縱切,會看到在邊緣系統的經脈有如花瓣狀,以及一束束的經脈。故若得到啟發,你會看見頂輪一束束的火燄。若大腦裡的靈量得到啟發,大腦便能領悟真理,大腦看見並進入真理。一直以來,我們頭腦所認識的都不是真理,所見的只是表面。例如顏色,你們可看見顏色之美,物件的質素,但你不能知道這張地毯是否曾有聖人用過,你不能知這地毯是由惡魔製造的,還是上天聖人製造的,你不能知道這人是好人還是邪惡的人,你不能知道這神祇是否從大地之母處來,你不能知道這人是好人還是壞人。你不能知道你的親友是好是壞,不知道他和好人交往還是和壞人交往。是連接到邪惡的一面,還是美好的一面。好是指屬於上天,但你不能知道一切屬於上天的,除非你的靈量昇到大腦邊緣系統並啟發了你,否則你不能知道上天的一切。因為上天是不能透過腦袋去理解的,除非靈體的光照亮了大腦。靈體(the Spirit)是表現在心,靈體的中心在心。但其實靈體的位置是在心之上,頭之上,而這個永恆的靈我們稱之為全能的神,或Parvardigar,或稱 Sadashiva,Rahim,或任何對全能的神的稱呼,Niranjan,Nirankar,任何名字是以Nir或Nihi為開頭的。現在,在身體的不同中心,你得到不同的喜樂。不同的中心有不同的喜樂,亦有名字稱呼這不同的喜樂,若靈量上昇,你便得到,但靈量昇上頂輪,你便會得到Niranand,即無邊的喜樂。Ni即沒有其他,只是喜樂。我的名字叫Neera,在家中我被稱為Neera。而“Neera”的意思是瑪利亞(Mary,Marium),因為這意思是汪洋,而Neera是水,Neer在梵文的意思是水。在大腦中稱為Niranand。

這個階段最後被打開,首先你會知道真理(Satya)。那人有什麼問題,你會從自己的手指頭上知道。透過注意力,你會從手指頭知道那個輪穴受到感染。因為若你手指有刺痛,你不知道這是代表喉輪,但你的腦袋能說給你知這是喉輪,於是你便知道喉輪出現問題。但這是理性層面,因為你看到手指的反應才這樣說。若頂輪打開得更多,你就不用去想,你就能說出來。這樣注意力(Chitta)和真理(Sat)便合二為一。受啟發的注意力與受啟發的頭腦成為一體。這個人什麼問題也沒有。你們便不用從手指感應,從大腦便知道那裡出現問題。你們在霎哈嘉瑜伽學到的,如果額頭有問題,就表示額輪,你完全不需要感應。你單說是額輪,就表示那裡出了問題。

然後,頂輪打開更多,首先是與注意力整合,跟著與永恆的靈整合,那時你說什麼都是真理。於是大腦開展了三個新的向度。在第一階段是通過邏輯推理去知道真理。比如食指有阻塞,你便知道是喉輪。你問那人喉部是否有問題,他說是,你便會信我,同時知道是喉輪的問題。這是邏輯推理。你有切身經驗,但仍有疑惑,不知母親所說的是否屬實。然後你開始相信,「真是喉輪有問題」,這樣你的大腦開始相信。但這個過程還是在很粗糙的層面。

在第二階段,你肯定地知道是喉輪,沒有疑惑。這時無疑惑的知覺狀態便開始。你不再懷疑我或霎哈嘉瑜伽,同時在內裡展開新的面向。要使你的注意力溶入受啟發的頭腦,你首先要非常誠實,要順服於霎哈嘉瑜伽。

得到能量以後怎樣呢?不同的人有不同的反應。有些人不明白能量的價值,有些人則嘗試去了解。另外有些人想:我現在已是覺醒的靈,可以給予他人自覺,可以這樣那樣,沒完沒了。他們的自我膨脹。但最後都失敗及回過頭來,從新開始。就好像玩跳棋,打回頭重新來過。因此我們在能量之前要謙卑下來。

我告訴過你們大腦中有你們的天父在,如果你對天父犯下任何罪惡,便要一段時間才能打開大腦。例如,這些人不斷看書,儘管旁人提醒他們先有感應,才好去看書。但這些人會說:有什麼不對,不可以讀其他書嗎?這樣的人會向下降。他們認為靜坐沒有甚麼用,他們沒有時間,有這些事要辦,那些事要辦,這種人不能進步。

另一點要說的也非常粗糙。在霎哈伽瑜伽,有許多非常粗糙的人也跑進來。這不要緊,但首先你們要非常誠實,在霎哈嘉瑜伽要非常誠實。好像我看見某些人,如果有什麼宴會,他一定潛身進去,一點也不尊重自己,也不考慮誰最後要付款。他們甚至帶同家人,大吃一頓。有些人老是逃避付款。好像有些人在外旅行,他們要付旅行和食物的費用。你們知道有時我要付很多錢。這並不要緊,我不會介意。但這對你不好,這才重要。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你怎樣看待錢是十分重要的,雖然這些看起來很粗鄙。但如果臍輪有阻塞,便會妨礙整個能量系統的開展。臍輪的阻塞會漫延至幻海,如果幻海阻塞,那十一個毀滅力量便會發生作用,這十一個毀滅力量在髮際,是潛伏在我們內部的。

有些人愛吝嗇,有些人則借霎哈嘉瑜伽賺錢,有些人愛不交費用。這都是作弊的行為,這些人都會很快離開霎哈嘉瑜伽。他們開始時可能像個領袖,但許多都是這樣離開了。有些人問為甚麼不設立賬簿。但在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我不會設立甚麼賬戶,因為我的會計師都是霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者。如果你有作弊,便會立即被趕出去,你的知覺,你的臍輪會懲罰你。比如你在這裡賺到幾千盧比,你會在其他地方失去這幾千盧比,同時會有麻煩。你會有許多的不能盡說的問題,你也不知道為甚麼要發生在你身上。如果在求道途中你不誠實,臍輪便會阻塞。求道的真誠不單是有求道的欲望,同時亦指你的行為,你怎樣對待自己和對待他人。你要對自己誠實。當靜坐時,要讓自己進入無思慮的知覺狀態,並擴得更大。要達到那境界。誠實是有報償的。你可以昇得更高,進入更深的靜坐。開始時,你要依賴我,讓母親為你做一切事情。你來見母親時,頂輪便打開。並且發生許多事情。但你自己有沒有做些事情,讓頂輪打開呢?打開頂輪是很重要的。

頂輪處是梵穴(Brahmarandhra)之所在,這裡也是心輪的位置。梵穴是連接心臟的。若不是從心裡發生效用,表面的練習霎哈嘉瑜伽,你不能有長足的進步。你們要全心擺上,這是最主要的。好像有些人來到霎哈嘉瑜伽,但他們在背後喋喋不休,說長道短。這類人便是耶穌基督所說的喃喃終日的靈魂。他們在背後喃喃終日,看準時機拿好處,還裝著去拯救他人般。所有這些人都會受很大的苦,因為他們在玩雙重的把戲,若你要進入上天的國度,玩這些把戲是十分危險的。任何國家的成員,若是出賣了國家,便要受到懲罰。但在神的國度裡,是多麼的喜樂,絕對的喜樂,完全的喜樂注滿每樣事物。健康、財富、心智、情緒,一切的豐盛都會在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡得到。你如此受到祝福,你亦得到寬恕,一再的寬恕。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,有很長的繩索給你,但弄不好你便會吊死自己。

有些人以為可以對霎哈嘉瑜伽不誠實,要當心,不要這樣。若你不想成為霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者,那麼請離開,對你對我們都有好處。因為如果你不誠實,嘗試玩把戲,欺騙別人,你便會受苦,變得行為乖謬,滑稽可笑。跟著人們會說,霎哈嘉瑜伽出了甚麼問題?那時我們便會受不必要的苦。因為我們不能在鏡子中給別人看事情的經過,證明這人是如何的不忠誠。故此,最初這人會帶給我們壞名聲。你要對霎哈嘉瑜伽及你的追求誠實,你不知道神多麼照顧你。任何人嘗試傷害你,他先會受到極大的傷害。神保護你,用祂完全的注意力和關懷去保護你。祂如此充滿愛,祂的慈愛不能言喻,只可去感受,去明白。

現在,問題是這樣,那些不誠實的人,是由於他們的背景,有時是出於他的教育,他的成長,有時是因為他懦弱。但還有一樣東西會令你不誠實,就是你的前生,這決定你如何出生,你的靈量會變得怎樣。

但得到覺醒後,那些勇敢無懼,具有巨大力量昇進的人,一切問題,包括星座的問題,都會消失。你會變成霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者,得到重生。成為完全不同的人。你的出身完全不能作用於你,就像一隻蛋變成美麗的鳥兒。

故此當靈量上昇,到達大腦,進入頂輪,首先要通過的是Ekadasha rudra,那裡有十一種毀滅的力量,每邊五個,中間一個。這是我們裡頭的障礙,是由我們犯下的兩類罪惡造成。若我們拜假導師,把自己投入他們那裡,便會在右邊出現rudra的問題,右邊那五個便完了。若你曾拜過那些錯誤的人,敵對神的人,問題便在右邊出現。若你曾以為可以照顧自己,是自己的導師,沒有人可以教你,不聽任何人說話,不相信神,不關心有沒有神,如果你有這些想法的話,你右邊不會感染,但左邊卻會受感染,因為右邊移向左邊,左邊移向右邊。這裡是十個力量,還有一個是 Virata Vishnu。因為在我們的胃部是十大宗師的所在,再加上一位是毗濕奴。故此,若追求錯誤,那十大宗師的部位便完了,於是你出現Ekadasharudra的問題。若這些在你裡面已形成,一個在左邊,另一個在右邊,那些人崇拜錯誤的人,便會發展出一種性向及人格,很容易染上癌症或其他不治之症。

有些人以為自己比任何人都好,對神莫不關心,不想有神,什麼也不想做,他們會出現左邊的Ekadasha的問題。左邊的Ekadasha十分危險,因為這些人會出現右邊的問題,有心臟病及一切右邊的毛病。靈量上昇至頂輪,其中一個最大的障礙是Ekadasha-rudra,這是來自幻海的,同時覆蓋著大腦,於是靈量便不能進入邊緣系統。即使有些人曾相信假導師,但如果他們順服於霎哈嘉瑜伽,承認以前的過錯,並說「我是自己的導師」,這樣他們便得到醫治。而那些曾以為自己在一切之上,不相信神,不相信任何先知的人會出現問題。但若他們謙卑下來,接受霎哈嘉瑜伽是唯一通往超越意識的途徑,他便會得到醫治。

我看過那些到過瑜伽術士去的人得到治療,我看過做盡錯事的人都得到治療,那些曾是古怪滑稽團體成員的人,都能得救。但要使人們知道自己以前所做的乃屬錯誤,返回正道,卻十分困難。

有一顆星與冥王星的作用相反,是會帶來癌症的。冥王星可以醫治癌症及一切不治之症。那些人不斷走錯路,出現古怪的心臟病、發抖、失眠、嘔吐、頭暈等等。到假導師那裡去是十分嚴重的。有些人反對霎哈嘉瑜伽,他們的頂輪變得十分硬,有如硬殼果,你不能穿越頂輪,即使有大鐵鎚也打不開。

現在時刻已到,你們要認出霎哈嘉瑜伽。你們一定要這樣。以往你們認不出任何聖人、先知,任何降世神衹。但現在,唯一的條件是你們能承認,若你們不承認,頂輪便不能打開。頂輪打開,你便得到自覺。這是十分重要的,你一定要認出霎哈嘉瑜伽。有很多人說:「為甚麼要這樣相信霎哈嘉瑜伽?我們只需稱你為母親,這樣便好了」。這樣你們便得不到自覺。即使得到,也不能鞏固。你們要認出,承認是霎哈嘉瑜伽唯一的崇拜方式。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你要認識神。所有的左部仙眾(ganas)、右部仙眾(devas)、神衹、女神,在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡都是一體的。任何人認不出霎哈嘉瑜伽,祂們也不會理會你。例如有個崇拜濕婆神的人來到我面前,我發覺他的心輪阻塞。真是十分奇怪。他說:「母親,我崇拜濕婆神,心輪怎會阻塞?」我說:「你要認出霎哈嘉瑜伽,你問濕婆神吧。」他求問於濕婆神,生命能量便開始流通。要知道,頂輪正是掌管那職責,令你認出霎哈嘉瑜伽,令你心悅誠服,向你證明。要是向你證明,你還是認不出,那你就得不到自覺。

但那些認出的,只是部分的認出。他們的自我放任,行為古怪可笑,並不明白誰人在他們面前。許多次我在說話,不少人舞動雙手提昇靈量,有些人更在閒談。我感到驚訝,因為若你們認出我,便應該知道你們面對何人。這對我來說沒有甚麼好處,我不會損失甚麼,只是你們認不出自己的昇進。

同樣,有些人想壟斷我,這是完全錯誤的。你們沒有需要壟斷我。有些人說:「母親,你誤會了。」我從來沒有誤會。有些人告訴我做這個,做那個,這並不需要。你們要開放自己,接受霎哈嘉瑜伽的禮儀,這十分重要。我第一次已向你們說過,現在你們要完全認出。若你們認不出,很抱歉,我不能給你們自覺,即使你們得到,也不能維持。

故此得到昇進的最簡單方法是認出,漸漸地認出。若那人有問題便很難向他們說,甚至沒有可能。練習霎哈嘉瑜伽以後,我可以告訴你,那個輪穴有阻塞。但因為你認識輪穴,你會反過來說:「不是,不是,母親,看,我不是這樣。」我為何要告訴你有阻塞?你要真誠地清潔。但首先你要以謙卑與瞭解去承認。當你承認,漸漸地,你會做應做的,你知道要做甚麼。

頂輪的性質是整合,在頂輪處,所有輪穴都在這裡。所有神衹都得到整合,你亦可感到這整合,即是說,若你們的靈量到達頂輪,你的心智、情緒、靈性都成為一體,你的身體亦會得到整合,你就沒有什麼問題。有些人說:「是的,我愛母親,但我一定要偷錢。」「是的,我認出母親,知道她的偉大,但我不能不向她說謊。」或說:「我一定要做錯事,因為我無能為力。」沒有什麼可妥協,這一定要完全的整合,你的正道一定要正確,你不能做錯事,然後說自己是霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者,不能這樣。

力量是發自內在的,永恆的靈給你力量。且付出意志的力量,讓永恆的靈工作,然後根據永恆的靈行事。當你開始按永恆的靈行事,便發覺不會受任何事物奴役。你成為“Samartha”,”Sam”意即等同你的意思,Sam + Artha 是 Samartha,意即強大的人格。你要發展出強大的人格,沒有脾氣,沒有錯誤念頭,沒有阻塞,沒有問題。

自私的人玩弄把戲,只會傷害自己,而不是霎哈嘉瑜伽。霎哈嘉瑜伽已開始確立。即使只有十人得救,神也不會介懷,只有我作為母親才會介懷,我希望更多人能在船上。但不要做種種不誠實的事去跳離這船。

就是這樣簡單,你們被整合。透過整合,你有力量去做你所明白的,你有力量去感受你所明白的快樂。故此你會進入無邊的喜樂(Niranand)這個層次。你會發展出純潔的喜樂,你完全成為永恆的靈。在無邊的喜樂這個層次再沒有二元性,是 Adwaita(即沒有二元性),是一個人格。即是說你完全得到整合,喜樂再不會有缺陷,而是完全的。再沒有喜樂及憂愁兩面,但只是喜樂。那喜樂不是指大笑,也不是指經常微笑。不是。而是寧靜,內裡真我的寧靜,你自身,你靈體的平安,化為你所感受到的生命能量。當你感受到這平安,你好像感受到陽光,整個光線的優美在散播。

頂輪是上天的祝福。它工作得十分好。打開頂輪十分困難。當我打開頂輪時,我真不知道是如此成功的。首先,我想還未到成熟的階段,因為有很多羅剎魔(Rakshasas)在街上,販賣物品;還有很多狂熱主義者稱自己跟隨甚麼宗教,但實質不是靈體的真正宗教。但漸漸地,它開始扎根。現在讓真理透過頂輪在你裡面扎根。當真理絕對成為引導你的光,那光便會滋養你,那光會啟示你,給你有光的人格。跟著你便知道頂輪被你的靈完全啟發。你的面容給人知道在他面前的是一個人格有「光」的人。就是這樣頂輪得到照顧。

要照顧頂輪,重要的是在冬季把頭蓋上。在冬季最好把頭蓋上,這樣腦袋不會被冷壞,因為腦袋是由 medha 即脂肪組成,故不能遇驟凍。而且亦不要令頭上有太多熱力。要保持頭腦良好,不要像西方人那樣坐在太陽下終日曝曬。那樣,你的腦袋溶化,你會成為發狂的人,這是人們走向瘋狂的顯示,我已向你多次說過,不要令頭上有太多的熱。即使坐在太陽下,也要把頭蓋上,這十分重要。但這只是間中做,不要終日把頭蓋上,因為你會令頭腦終日沉重,這樣血液流通便差,你也會出現血液循環不良。故此有時要打開頭腦接觸太陽或月亮。否則你便會瘋癲,住進精神病院裡。任何我告訴你們的,你們要知道,在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡不要走向極端。即使在水中做足浴,有人會坐上三小時。我從沒有叫人這樣做。你只須坐上十分鐘,但要全心的。若我告訴他們甚麼,他們會連續這樣做上四小時,這是沒有需要的。只做十分鐘。給你的身體不同的治療法,不要終日只做一種。你的身體會悶透了,會完全負荷過重。若你對人說,這是你的口訣(mantra),好吧!你便這樣做,直至輪穴好了。假設有個螺絲是放在這裡的,好了,你就把螺絲鑽進上。鑽上了便不要繼續鑽下去。你是否要繼續不停鑽下來,直至一切都完全破壞?最好你們要用智慧。為了那智慧,要知道格涅沙(Shri Ganesha)及耶穌基督是在兩邊的位置。這裡是摩訶格涅沙(Mahaganesha)(後部),這裡是耶穌(前部)。兩者都幫助你改正你的視野,理解,並給你智慧。故此智慧不是要幹某種事情。霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者不是頑固的人。若他們固執,就得不到進步。你不是要去固執於一些念頭或執著於某些人。你要時常在流通,這不是說你要在那裡跌下,而人們說:「啊!你很快學會,因為你要跌下去。」你一定要昇進,而不是跌落。

故此,若你在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡成就甚麼,首先你要看出你健康的改進。你的心智是正常的。你應是正常的人。若你們仍然會向別人大聲怒罵,要知道你一定是出現問題。或若你要墮下,生悶氣,並仍然發脾氣,若你仍然是心情不佳,這樣你要知道你還不是霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者。你可判斷你自己。若你覺得自由如小鳥,好吧,但不是要在街上像雀鳥般唱歌,在樹上蹦跳。你要明白,我說的任何比喻,若是愚蠢的人,他們便會愚蠢地去做。若是有智慧的人,他們會明辨甚麽是正確的行為。因此要知道,霎哈嘉瑜伽是給那些謹慎而有智慧的人的。

你只要固守一樣東西,就是你的靈(Atma)。你好像風箏,飛到任何地方去,但仍然連接著你的靈。你要能做到,不要過分憂慮金錢、家庭及其他世俗的事。只要做一個靈體保護,若不成功,便罷了。若成功,也應平常視之。你的意願並不重要。經上說:「願祂的旨意成就」。起初你這樣說,但後來卻要求自己的意願得以成就,於是產生自我。因此要小心。一切都是由女神的力量(shakti)成就,不是你去成就,是你的永恆的靈,不是你。你要成為永恆的靈,當你成為永恆的靈以後,要進入超越善惡(Akarm)的境界,你不知道自己在做事,但事情會成就。

我希望經過這些講授,你們大部分的輪穴都得以打開。這全是我的工作。但你們也有一點家課。你要為自己去做,要保持警覺。嘗試像照鏡那樣看自己,看自己是否誠實,是否清潔,在集體中是否友善,這在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡十分重要。若你不合群,滑稽古怪,不能與人溝通,那一定有地方出問題。你要面對自己,改正自己。你將自己分離出來看自己,然後清潔。好像我脫下紗麗,才能清潔它。同樣你要將自己分離,然後清潔自己。這就是霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者進步的方法。若那個人得到昇進,其餘一切都會昇進。很多這類霎哈瑜伽修習者都能給人深刻的印象。很多人都得到昇進,故此整體昇進得很快。但那些昇得很高的人不是為了自己昇得很高,這是很重要的。那些以為別人比自己好的,也是錯誤,因為事實不是這樣。整體是一起昇進的,任何人都不必覺得比別人差,也不應有任何人感到低下或受侮辱。因為上天不是這樣看問題的。這些細微的事你們都要注意。在這過渡期(Krita Yuga)是十分容易得到自覺(Atma Sakshatkar)的。今天我說了不少關於頂輪的知識。

I think today I have told you quite a lot about Sahasrara but if you have any problem about Sahasrara you may ask Me now but only about Sahasrara and nothing else. It’s better to ask Me questions about Sahasrara instead of all other things.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi aside: Do like this, keep them both, keep this on top of the other.] 
 You can ask Me questions.
 [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi: Spread it like this. Just spread one and see. It’s better now. The chair is not comfortable. The seat is... Ok, let it be. These plastic things...
 What is the question? What is he saying?]
 [The question in Hindi is about "samadha" and "bindu"].

Shri Mataji: Yes, this is the trouble with you. You read some nonsensical books "samadhi", "bindu", this, that, all that. Now please forget it, please forget all these things. "Sama-dhi", "samadhi" means, first is the nirvichara samadhi [thoughtless awareness]. First is nirvichara samadhi that you achieve and the Kundalini just comes out of your head. "Sama-dhi" means, the "dhi" means the "buddhi" [intellect in a large sense]. And when it has got enlightenment it means Samadhi. So, first of all, the buddhi gets enlightened – just now I told you about that only, the first enlightenment. 
 Now, the Bindu and this and that are higher stages [Shri Mataji puts her hand above Sahasrara]. Ardha Bindu, then Bindu and then Valaya. But you should not be futuristic, just now if you have read some book no use trying to show off that. That’s not a good thing. Just try to see what you are. Why do you want to talk about things which – which do not concern at this stage?
 Just now, supposing you are going by bullock cart, why do you want to ask about the aeroplane? Just now you go by bullock cart, then you get into the train, then you get into the airplane. All right? One by one, not like this. Because you have read the book, it’s not -doesn’t mean that you are supposed to know everything. All these books are written by some sort of prankish fellows who have read something here and there and have put it down. But you must experience. I’m your Mother, so I don’t want to give you big ideas, this and that. I want you to do the way we have to move. As a mother would say, “Now, this is the way you are. Now you are in the first class, so pass your first exam. Then you’ll go into the second class, then pass your exam”. Everybody has to go that way to mature properly; there should be no immaturity in a personality. So, all these books that you have read you better throw them away, it’s no good. But if it is by some Realized souls you can keep them and think that they are higher people and we have to be at their stage. Only by reading the book you don’t become those personalities, do you?

[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi: What next?
 Sahaja Yogi: Similar question.
 Shri Mataji: Similar questions.]

Shri Mataji: All such questions are there, one better than the other. I’ll tell you it is such a empty thing, how can you be satisfied with empty things? You haven’t got anything.

First of all, achieve a state. First of all, settle down, gradually you will know about it. By reading books you do not become anyway Realized soul, do you?

According to Mr. Kulkarni all questions are of this type, they are of no use. That only means that you have read some books, that’s all, finished, nothing more there. And it’s true. If you have just read some books you are just coming and quoting here, no use. Gradually come up. If you are honest and if you want to have it, then come up gradually. Just don’t try to show off anything.

You better give him writing. [The questions will be written and a Sahaja Yogi will read them]

Sahaja Yogi: There are request that, You please give a part of your lecture in Hindi, because some people cannot understand English, they find it difficult.
 Shri Mataji: All right. You see, now I’ve given My lecture in English. But I give my lectures in Hindi also in different places. Here I’m giving in English. So those who want to hear Me in Hindustani can come to other programs.

[Shri Mataji conversing in Hindi:
 Where is it on the 7th?
 Sahaja Yogi: 7th in Delhi University Mother, Gandhi Bhavan
 Shri Mataji: Ah?
 Sahaja Yogi: Delhi University – Gandhi Bhavan
 Shri Mataji: Gandhi Bhavan in Delhi I’ll speak in Hindi. 
 After that?
 Sahaja Yogi: 7th evening. 7th evening.
 Shri Mataji: Ah?
 Sahaja Yogi: 7th in the evening
 Shri Mataji: 7th in the evening, you come there. Will tell you in Hindi. I speak in all languages. Will tell you in Hindi. Then we are going to Kalkaji on the 10th. Then where are we going? Where are we going on the 9th?
 Sahaja Yogi: On 9th Mother, Jangpura. Jangpura
 Shri Mataji: On 9th we are going to Jangpura. There all speak in Hindi. Had recently gone to a temple and spoken in Hindi there. 
 Sahaja Yogi: On 8th Safdarjung Enclave
 Shri Mataji: On 8th at Safdarjung Enclave. You take all the addresses. You come there. I will speak in Hindi there. And then these poor English people who have come, they just sit in meditation. They never say, “You speak in English. We have come from so far, spending so much of money”. No one says like that.]
 Sahaja Yogi: One question is there – pustaki [bookish].
 Shri Mataji: Ah?
 Sahaja Yogi: There is a bookish question.
 Shri Mataji: Pustaki?] 
 [Shri Mataji is laughing].

Shri Mataji: He calls it pustaki [bookish], pustaki questions, pustaki. You see, it is nothing Divine, it’s all pustaki. This is true. That’s why I used to wonder why Kabirdasa said, “Padi padi pandita moorakha whai” [on reading, the learned become stupid]. Now I know why he said it, because by reading people really become funny and they just try to test Me, my knowledge, or trying to show off their own knowledge. Ka pustaki? What bookish?

Sahaja Yogi: What is relation between Kundalini, prana and astral body and soul. Are they same, but different forms?

Shri Mataji: Astral body, prana...

Question: Kundalini and soul.

Shri Mataji: Soul. Now this gentleman who has asked the question perhaps has come only today. Otherwise, I’ve explained most of these things. But for your benefit I’ll tell you.

First is Kundalini. Kundalini is the pure desire to be one with God and this energy is placed in the sacrum bone, which is awakened when some authorized person from God can raise it. This is Kundalini, is pure desire. Now, prana is the Shakti, expression of the Shakti of the right-side, that is Mahasaraswati Shakti, is created out of five elements, called prana. 

Astral – what – Astral body?

Sahaja Yogi: Astral bodies. 

Shri Mataji: Astral bodies are in simple Hindi language are "bhoots" and they are the people who just come into your being and take your soul out. Never try these tricks, never. These tricks are tried in America very much. And I’ve told them not to try such tricks and horrible things are happening because a person living in Geneva had a child and in are you know English people don’t keep their children sleeping with them. So, the child used to sleep in another room and the lady, her grandmother, who was fond of this child wanted to talk to the child through this astral body business. And every night she used to talk to the child. 

Ultimately, so happened, that the soul of the child which she used to call out, could not return back to the body and got lost and the child died. It has so many problems, astral body things have, that it is nothing but a dead soul from the left or the right can come into you and can carry your soul outside your body and you can be lost, you can be dead. So, this is something going just the other way round than the Kundalini awakening. By Kundalini awakening, your Prana Shakti and your Mana Shakti [left-side] are integrated and you become one with the Divine so your Super Consciousness is awakened.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

Sahaja Yogi: I can feel the Kundalini reaching my head, but I can’t feel it come out and I can’t feel the cool vibrations.
 Shri Mataji: That is good. Somebody is feeling the Kundalini on their head, that is what Kabirdasa has clearly said: "Shunnya shikhara para anahada baje re". So, the "anadahatha" is hitting the fontanel bone, but it is not coming out, that’s it. Then, means it has not broken the Brahmarandra, as simple as that. Till it has not broken the Brahmarandra you cannot feel the cool breeze, it’s absolutely spontaneous, it has to work out that way. So is correct, your Brahmarandra is not broken, that is your stage. So, it has to break and the reason for that is something wrong with your heart. If your heart is clean it will break, if your heart is strong it will break, but if you have a weak heart also it will not break, if you’re suffering from heart trouble it will not break. It has something to do with your heart. If you are a seeker of other things than Spirit also it may not break. So, there are many reasons various reasons why this Brahmarandra won’t break. But what is a reason that we have to find out – yourself, you can face yourself and find out what’s the matter.

[Conversation in Hindi.
 Shri Mataji: Give them, give it to them.
 Lady: About the vibrations, I wrote.
 Shri Mataji: What about vibrations you wrote child?
 Lady: Just now they told.]
 Shri Mataji: Brahmarandra. We’ll work it out; we’ll work it out for you, all right?
 Sit down, doesn’t matter. We’ll work it out, don’t you worry, it will work out. It takes sometimes little time, doesn’t matter. Why should you have fear about it? Just it will work out. 
 Lady: I have a headache, right away.
 Shri Mataji: Yes, we’ll work it out. All right? It will work out. 

Who else, what else is there?

Sahaja Yogi: One man says he had met Muktananda, now he finally wants to be closely with your Sahaja Yoga meditation centre: "I fully believe that we will be able to achieve the main aim of life by this Realization. Mother please advise and awaken our Kundalini so as to get rid of all physical and mental ailments."

Shri Mataji: Ah! This Muktananda! "Are baap re baap"! [Oh God! God gracious!] Terrible fellow. Hum. There is a mantra for him. Who are the people of Muktananda? Just raise your hands please. Those who have written this letter about Muktananda, raise your hands please.
 So now, we’ll tell you the mantra how to get rid of the problems, all right? There’s a mantra for that who he was in the past life and all that, I know and we know how to get rid of it. But you have to religiously do it, religiously do it and you’ll get rid of. I know it has it has done lot of harm to many people. But if those who are not anymore into the clutches, we can work it out, alright? So, all those who are wanting to know about it you will know in our centres or if you can come on the sides, I’ll ask somebody to help you, all of those of that kind. Now, what else is there?

[Conversation in Hindi. 
 Question: 10-year-old kid has given. 
 Shri Mataji: Ah?
 Question: A 10-year-old kid has written. There is a 10-year-old kid. “I am a 10-year-old kid and I study in class 4. Can I be awakened Mother? If yes, then kindly awaken me”.
 Shri Mataji: Yes, yes definitely. If he is 10 years old, he will get Realization first.
 Question: I am first in studies. Respect my mother and father. Let me be good in Sahaja Yoga. I am in front of you. Many salutations.
 Shri Mataji: Ok you come this side. Everyone will get Realization.]

Those who have not got Realization should come on this side and that side and all of them should be worked out. We have lots of Sahaja Yogis from all over the world and everybody must get Realization, no doubt about it.

Question: Physically I am fit, no heart problems. My problem is that I think too much about myself. Result is that I have become a psychic case.

Shri Mataji: All right, those who are a psychic case also should come this side, I will tell them how it arises, from where, all right?

Sahaja Yogi: Kindly advise: “Being a new Sahaja Yogi, may I practice meditation in office keeping Your photo before me? During office hours some time we have spare time gossiping, taking tea etc. I want that time to be utilized in Sahaja Yoga meditation in office. Although I started doing meditation in my house before going to sleep, kindly advise and give all alternatives.

Shri Mataji: No, not in the office, you cannot do meditation in the office at all. You see, you have to be very careful. Actually, you see, office people are so gross and they will never understand Sahaja Yoga. So, best thing is first to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga, not about Me, don’t even show them my photograph, because it’s very funny that some people who see my photograph are frightened, they can’t see Me. If they are possessed, they even shake before Me. So, it’s better not to tell them about Me, but about Sahaja Yoga, how you are helped. Gradually with great care, like a nice mother you must bring them to the position where they can receive Realization. And then gradually open the thing, but not in the office, please, no, not in the office. You have to do it at home and you have to do it in the group where you meet in the centres. That you must do every week, that is very important. And once a month in the ashram, once a month in the ashram.

Question: Man says should one do yogic asanas and pranayamas? Should one do transcendental meditation, second question?
 Shri Mataji: Cha transcendental kakya? [What transcendental, what?]
 Seeker: Transcendental Meditation. 
 Shri Mataji: Should we do? 
 Seeker: TM.
 Shri Mataji: He’s done. [Laughter]. He’s done all that? 
 Now, about pranayama and about, I’ve already talked about it, but you might come now. Pranayam and all these physical exercises of Hatha Yoga now I’ve already told that in Sahaja Yoga we too do some exercises, it’s quite a lot. For physical fitness sometimes, sometimes for adjusting our Chakras and all that and for improving the back bone, we do exercises. But we have to know what chakra is catching, there’s a science. It’s not done that your throat is bad and you are doing all the asanas for the stomach. All the asanas are not done. Like taking all the medicines at the same time. One is for cold, one is for heat, it’s like that, all the medicines we don’t take. So, according to need of the person we do pranayama also we do according to the need of the person. Gradually we understand what is wrong with us and that’s how we do the asana. Not blindfolded. First thing. Then about transcendental meditation less said the better. You have to see for yourself what others have achieved, you see. When you go to guru you must first find out how much money he takes. If he takes the money, just don’t go, first thing.

Secondly, how does he live, what is his style of life. Thirdly what others have achieved, what is their condition. Most of the disciples of transcendental meditations are now beggars on the street. And some of them are epileptic patients, I have seen so many getting epilepsy. So, if you have done transcendental meditation, it is not meditation but it is anti-God thing.

So you have to first neutralize yourself, come down to normal conditions and then you receive your Realization. We have a lady here who was a granddaughter of a Duke. She lost all her money and her husband was the director of one of these “flying squads” that he was having. He lost all his money and became bankrupt, this lady got epilepsy, he got epilepsy, her child got epilepsy, all of them got epilepsy. They came to Sahaja Yoga when they had nothing with them. Today, they are all right, all corrected and they are doing well. But we do not take a guarantee on anything because you have to also decide in your mind that you are not going to have these funny ideas, because some of the TM people who come are so arrogant so egoistical, that it is impossible to manage them. So, it is your need, not our need and that’s how you should come to a doctor as a patient comes. Then only it will work out. Otherwise don’t waste our time, please.

That? Now all the questions are over and for the last time, let us go into meditation here in this hall.

[The seat where Shri Mataji is sitting is being adjusted.
 Sahaja Yogi in Hindi: “There is a cushion under You also, that’s why you are feeling uncomfortable” “There is a cushion under you also that’s why you are uncomfortable” ... 
 Shri Mataji – “But, no I wanted that. It’s a very, very – ‘put it at the back’, it’s a very uncomfortable seat you see. Just sitting for such a long time, is impossible. [In Hindi] Have to raise all the Kundalini from the back. Need to put a lot of pressure from the back. Not able to put pressure”.]

Please close your eyes.
 [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi: All of you close your eyes. In Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to understand the language. Because for this work, it does not involve your brain. It happens with the movement of your hand. You completely close your eyes. But you don’t have to close it tightly. Just close it normally.]
 Keep yourself steady.
 [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi:
 Steady yourself a bit. On steading yourself, keeping the eyes closed, put your hands towards Me. And don’t bend your neck backwards or forwards. Just sit steadily. Look towards yourself, don’t think about others. Keeping your eyes closed, look at yourself. This is your physical state. The mental state should be such that it is not a very serious thing. It is a play to your mind – a game. That is why maintain a pleasant attention, pleasant attention. It does not mean that you laugh and sit. But be in joyous state. Don’t be in troubled state. There will be no problem. You will not be troubled. Very easily the Kundalini can be awakened. That’s why without any tension, sit very comfortably. Absolutely no tension. 
 Don’t hang your head backwards or bend it downward. Keep your neck in the centre.]

There should be no shaking, nothing, be steady, be steady.
 [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi:
 Stay still. No moving. The bodily gestures, nothing needs to be done. Be calm. It is a happening within. This is ‘antar yog’. It happens on the inside.]

Keep your attention towards the fontanel bone area, towards the Brahmarandra. Keep both the hands strait towards Me, strait. Not towards yourself, but keep both the hands strait towards Me.
 Now. Now see for yourself from your head with your right hand on top of your head, if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi:
 Hold it on top. Hold it on top, without touching. All of you can see. All of you see, not that some people are seeing and some are not. Now raise both your hands to the top towards Me, raise both your hands. Now ask one question, “Mother, is this the Brahma Shakti?” Ask in your mind. First time your will feel the Brahma Shakti on your hands. First time this subtle Shakti you have felt. Because you are subtle. Now bring your hands down. Now remain calm. Don’t do too much of arguments. Because this cannot be taught through an argument and neither can it be understood by arguing. That’s why all those who have felt it stay calm. And for those it did not work out, for them, if they wish to achieve it, then come to the centre. If you wish you can come this side. These people will see them.
 After this there are three more programs. You should definitely come there. And next year I will come here again. Every year I come. Every year, you should be progressing more. You should grow. Slowly everything is growing.
 Those people who did not feel the cool breeze, if they come this side or this side, these people will see them.]
 Shri Mataji: Gavin? Gavin?
 Sahaja Yogi: There is a small announcement...
