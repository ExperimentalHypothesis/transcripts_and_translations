Star TV Interview, Istanbul (Turkey) April 1999.

Yogini [pointing to the bouquet of flowers offered to Shri Mataji]: They are from garden Mother. Collected for You.

SM: What's the name of the flower?

Interviewer: I don't know.

SM to the interviewer: All right. Thank you very much. Please be seated.

Yogini [interviewer’s questions/comments are being translated by a yogini in the video]: He feels himself different here, different atmosphere... Maybe because of the mystic looking... He feels very relaxed and comfortable.

SM: Very good. That's a very good idea.

Yogini translating: He is wondering whether You are coming from the bottom of the Indian Ocean, or are You coming from the top of the Himalayas.

SM: I am from the centre of India. Just, you see, on the Tropic of Cancer. Mecca is also on the Tropic of Cancer. That's the only [sounds like 'thing']

Yogini: Tropic of Cancer?

SM: What you call that? Equator. And above that 23 and half degrees is called as the...

Interviewer: In fact, I wanted to make a joke. As She is a very deep person and at the same time She is at the top of the world's affairs. That is, coming from such a big depth, with such a developed inner world, and at the same time being at the top level... I wanted to make such joke.

Yogini translating: Actually, it came from his heart. He wanted to express that the depth is coming from inside of You, he felt like this.

SM: That's true. India has a very deep spiritual culture. As you had sufis here, we had many saints in our country.

Yogini translating: What is the meaning of suffering in daily life?

SM: It comes out of ignorance. Because of ignorance and you are so much involved in the worldly life, you see, that's why you feel the suffering. But if you can rise above that, you don't feel the sufferings at all.

Yogini translating: In modern times, with technology, people are getting more and more far from inside and from God and they are not connected...

SM: They feel the suffering sometimes. They feel the suffering of this modern times much more.

Yogini translating: There are coincidences in life. Are these coincidences given as a message to the people?

SM: Of course, of course. They are messages. They are messages for us, to guide.

Yogini translating: Do You mean when people get these messages then they can go on the direction to the God, to be closer and closer if they get the signs right?

SM: Specially if they get the desire - the desire to know why all these problems... Desire to know the truth you see. When that starts coming up then you take to the path of seeking.

Yogini translating: God is always inside us, but the distance between God and us is upto what we do in our life. Is that right?

SM: Because you cannot feel your spirit, that's why. If you can feel your spirit, if you know yourself, then you are absolutely close to God Almighty.

Yogini translating: In this case, praising to God means that the way how we live our life, how we do the things... And even then we are before we go to sleep to open our hands and to pray is the real praising to God

SM: Is true, but your heart must be clean. If your heart is not clean and if you are just praying to God, God knows everything.

Yogini translating: We should know only [that] God knows everything, inside us

SM: Yes, He knows everything about us and He loves us. God loves us very much, He guides us. But if we do not want to listen to Him and want to listen to our own whims, then He says, “All right. Go ahead.”

Yogini translating: Do You like to watch movies?

SM: Sometimes. Yes, I do, if they are good.

Yogini translating: Did You see the movie ‘Titanic’?

SM: I did. I did.

Yogini translating: From the movie Titanic, he [the interviewer] was very impressed with one part. When the Titanic was under the water, they were just holding some wooden sticks and all, but it was very cold in the night. While he was in the water, girl was sitting on it. In the morning boy was frozen and until this time they couldn’t make other people hear that they need help. At the end, just at the last moment, they come near and at that moment they could hear she was still alive. Only one person was alive. Is this a blessing from God?

SM: Everything is a blessing from God. And, you see, the way we pay more attention to things which are not important - then you suffer also.

Yogini translating: Have You ever sinned?

SM: I can’t, very difficult.

Yogini translating: He says he is sorry to ask such a question to You. But, because all the [sounds like ‘luck’] is created by God, we can make mistakes. That’s why he ask You if You have ever made mistake?

SM: I have not. I mean, from the worldly point of view, maybe. But from God’s point of view, not.

Yogini translating: For example football – are you interested in football and is there any team which you are supporting?

SM: I never support any team anywhere. Because if you support, you cannot enjoy. You must keep a balance, then both parties are just the same. I can never take sides.

Yogini translating: He heard a saying which he likes very much. There are Armenians, Turks, Christians, all the kinds, but the rain always falls to all of them equally.

SM: They are all equal. This is all a man-made differences, God has not made that. Because the thing that works out your realization is the Kundalini, is in all of you.

Yogini translating: God created us equally. Only we are making the difference between God and us personally.

SM: That’s right. In a garden you have all kinds of flowers but they grow out of the same Mother Earth, you see. So there is no difference at all. But in their own variety... To create a variety, the beauty of variety, there are different flowers.

Yogini translating: Some black, pink, red, different different colors, the humans...

SM: Yes, that’s what it is. We are like that also. There is no difference basically. They are all flowers. In the same way, we are all human beings – there is no difference.

Yogini translating: Are people preparing their future according to what they have done today?

SM: They are. They are looking for... Lots of people are looking for truth, or looking for reality, no doubt.

Yogini translating: Whatever we do in this life also it affects the future. Our children and other...

SM: Whole society.

Yogini translating: What kind of music You like? Now we are listening, this must be an Indian music.

SM: I like every kind. I like Mozart. I like Vivaldi. And I like every kind of music. Music is more [not audible], you see. There are different kinds, that’s all. I don’t like very loud ones, that breaks My ear.

Yogini translating: Actually, he says the music should enter from the ear to the heart. Some of the music are just remaining in the ear, not going to heart.

SM: It blasts your heart.

Yogini translating: What is Your message for the human beings?

SM: Message is that all of you have within yourself a Power, in the triangular bone known as Sacrum, which is responsible for your further evolution. And this gives a new awareness within you. When it is awakened, you get collectively conscious. Kundalini is like a connection you have. You have to be connected to the Divine Power of Love, which is Ruh.

Yogini translating: Can we say for Sahaja Yoga that it is the answer and meaning for everything?

SM: Of course, of course that’s the solution. Because all problems are because of human beings who are ignorant. Once they become one with the Divine, all problems are solved.

Yogini translating: He would like to ask what do you like to eat in Turkey. Normally, he says all the foreigners like to eat Doner Shish Kebab.

SM: I like all kinds. Turkish food is the best, I think, in the whole world.

Yogini translating: He says it is not up to us to obtain the timing when how everything should happen. There is a power who does everything. In his life until he was 45, everything was very difficult, struggling on the ground he says. When he was 45, he felt that something was changed. And he says in his new life, this moment – the moment when he meets You – is a most special moment. This is a blessing from God. That is why he is thanking You.

SM: Thank you very much. Thank you very much to think like that. The way you have [sounds like ‘told’], it’s a great pleasure to meet you because you are a very sensitive person.

[Shri Mataji gives Self-realization to the interviewer who feels a very strong cool breeze on top of his head.]

Yogini translating: Very strongly he feels the breeze on his head.

SM: Oh Good. [Sounds like ‘This’] is the Power of Divine Love.

[Shri Mataji then briefly explains what has happened by referring to a chakra chart depicted in the pamphlet.]

SM: This is the triangular bone. This [energy] rises through six centres. Ultimately pierces through the sixth one. And that’s how what he felt... You can have this [pamphlet] and you can see this.

Shri Mataji then autographs the pamphlet with the message: “With My love and blessings. Mataji Nirmala Devi”]

Yogini translating: I will keep it on my heart.

Yogini (to the interviewer): Ataturk was a realized soul.

Yogini: He is asking if the cameraman can also get his realization.

SM: Yes, why not. He is carrying something heavy on his shoulder. Can he keep it down for a while?

SM: (explaining a miracle photograph): That was [taken] on a boat, on a ride. That was the day, the 5th of May it was. There were all people sitting here around Me. That was the day long time back – was the 5th of May 1970 – when the Sahasrara was opened in India. This [the miracle photo] happened much later. We were in [name of place not audible, sounds like ‘Ischia’] and we were going by boat. At that same time this photo [sounds like ‘was taken’].

Yogini: 5th of May?

SM: Yes, 5th of May. But much later – 10 years later.

Yogini translating: There are a lot of people sitting around?

SM: Yes but you can’t see them. They have all disappeared on the sides.

SM: This is the last photograph. But there are other photographs that show people first. And gradually they disappear.

SM: Now this [another miracle photo] is another one. With the white saree, standing in the sea. And this light appeared in the heart, on My heart.

SM: There are thousands of such photographs. Thousands of them.

SM: [explaining another miracle photo] My whole face was covered with the light, very strong light. But the flowers are all right there, nothing happens to them.
