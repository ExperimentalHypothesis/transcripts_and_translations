Shri Mataji, Star TV Interview, Turkey, Shashidhar, 01-04-1999

Yogini [pointing to the bouquet offered to Shri Mataji]: They are from the garden Mother. Collected for You.

Shri Mataji: What's the name of the flower?

Interviewer: I don't know.

Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you very much. Please be seated.

Yogini [interviewer’s questions/comments are being translated by a yogini in the video]: He feels different here. The atmosphere feels mystic... He feels very relaxed and comfortable.

Shri Mataji: Very good. That's a very good idea.

Yogini translating: He is wondering whether You are coming from the bottom of the Indian Ocean, or are You coming from the top of the Himalayas.

Shri Mataji: I am from the centre of India. Just, you see, on the Tropic of Cancer. Mecca is also on the Tropic of Cancer. That's the only [sounds like 'thing']

Yogini: Tropic of Cancer?

Shri Mataji: What you call that? [The] Equator. And above that 23 and a half degrees is called as the [Tropic of Cancer].

Interviewer: In fact, I meant it as a joke. Because She is a very deep person, and at the same time She has reached a great height. That is, a combination of a deep inner state and tremendous heights of achievement... I wanted my question to reflect this.

Yogini translating: Actually, it came from his heart. He wanted to express that You are a deep personality.

Shri Mataji: That's true. India has a very deep spiritual culture. As you had Sufis here, we had many saints in our country.

Yogini translating: What is the meaning of suffering in daily life?

Shri Mataji: It comes out of ignorance. Because of ignorance and you are so much involved in the worldly life, you see, that's why you feel the suffering. But if you can rise above that, you don't feel the sufferings at all.

Yogini translating: In modern times, with increasing use of technology, people are drifting away from their inner world and from God. They are not connected...

Shri Mataji: They feel the suffering sometimes. They feel the suffering of these modern times much more.

Yogini translating: There are coincidences in life. Are these coincidences a message to the people?

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. They are messages. They are messages for us, to guide.

Yogini translating: Do You mean when people get these messages then they can progress towards God, to be closer and closer if they understand the messages right?

Shri Mataji: Especially if they get the desire - the desire to know why all these problems... Desire to know the truth, you see. When that starts coming up then you take to the path of seeking.

Yogini translating: God is always inside us, but the distance between God and us depends on what we do in our life. Is that right?

Shri Mataji: Because you cannot feel your spirit, that's why. If you can feel your spirit, if you know yourself, then you are absolutely close to God Almighty.

Yogini translating: In this case, praising God means the way how we live our life, how we do the things... And we open our hands and pray before we go to sleep. And to pray is the real praising of God.

Shri Mataji: [That] is true, but your heart must be clean. If your heart is not clean and if you are just praying to God... God knows everything.

Yogini translating: We should know [that] God knows everything that is within us.

Shri Mataji: Yes, He knows everything about us and He loves us. God loves us very much, He guides us. But if we do not want to listen to Him and want to listen to our own whims, then He says, “All right. Go ahead.”

Yogini translating: Do You like to watch movies?

Shri Mataji: Sometimes. Yes, I do, if they are good.

Yogini translating: Did You see the movie ‘Titanic’?

Shri Mataji: I did. I did.

Yogini translating: In the movie Titanic, he [the interviewer] was very impressed with one part. When the Titanic was under the water, they were just holding on to some wooden planks and it was very cold in the night. While the boy was in the water, the girl was sitting on the plank. In the morning, the boy was frozen and until this time, they couldn’t make other people hear their cries for help. In the end, just at the last moment, they came close and they could hear that she was still alive. Only one person was alive. Is this a blessing from God?

Shri Mataji: Everything is a blessing from God. And, you see, the way we pay more attention to things which are not important - then you suffer also.

Yogini translating: Have You ever sinned?

Shri Mataji: I can’t, very difficult.

Yogini translating: He says he is sorry to ask You such a question. But, because all the [sounds like ‘luck’] is created by God, we can make mistakes. That’s why he’s asking if You have ever made a mistake?

Shri Mataji: I have not. I mean, from the worldly point of view, maybe. But from God’s point of view, not.

Yogini translating: Are You interested in (for example) football and is there any team which You are supporting?

Shri Mataji: I never support any team anywhere. Because if you support, you cannot enjoy [the game]. You must keep a balance, then both parties are just the same. I can never take sides.

Yogini translating: He heard a saying which he likes very much. There are Armenians, Turks, Christians etc. but the rain always falls equally on all of them.

Shri Mataji: They are all equal. This is all a man-made difference; God has not made that. Because the thing that works out your realization is the Kundalini, is in all of you.

Yogini translating: God has created us equal. Only we are making the difference between God and us personally.

Shri Mataji: That’s right. In a garden you have all kinds of flowers but they grow out of the same Mother Earth, you see. So there is no difference at all. But in their own variety... To create a variety, the beauty of variety, there are different flowers.

Yogini translating: Some black, pink, red, different colours, the humans...

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what it is. We are like that also. There is no difference. Basically they are all flowers. In the same way, we are all human beings – there is no difference.

Yogini translating: Are people preparing their future according to what they have done today?

Shri Mataji: They are. They are looking for... Lots of people are looking for truth or looking for reality, no doubt.

Yogini translating: Whatever we do in this life also affects the future. Our children and other...

Shri Mataji: Whole society.

Yogini translating: What kind of music do You like? The music we are listening to now must be Indian music.

Shri Mataji: I like every kind. I like Mozart. I like Vivaldi. And I like every kind of music. Music is more [not audible], you see. There are different kinds, that’s all. I don’t like very loud ones, that breaks My ear.

Yogini translating: Actually, he says the music that enters the ear should reach the heart. Some of the music are just remaining in the ear, not going to heart.

Shri Mataji: It blasts your heart.

Yogini translating: What is Your message for human beings?

Shri Mataji: Message is that all of you have within yourself a Power, in the triangular bone known as Sacrum, which is responsible for your further evolution. And this gives a new awareness within you. When it is awakened, you get collectively conscious. Kundalini is like a connection you have. You have to be connected to the Divine Power of Love, which is Ruh.

Yogini translating: Can we say that Sahaja Yoga is the answer and meaning for everything?

Shri Mataji: Of course. Of course that’s the solution. Because all problems are because of human beings who are ignorant. Once they become one with the Divine, all problems are solved.

Yogini translating: He would like to ask what You like to eat in Turkey. Normally, he says all the foreigners like to eat Doner Shish Kebab.

Shri Mataji: I like all kinds. Turkish food is the best, I think, in the whole world.

Yogini translating: He says it is not up to us to decide when and how everything should happen. There is a power that does everything. Everything was very difficult in his life until he was 45, he says. When he was 45, he felt that something had changed for the better. And he says that the moment he met You is the most special moment of his life. This is a blessing from God. That is why he is thanking You.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Thank you very much to think like that. The way you have [sounds like ‘told’], it’s a great pleasure to meet you because you are a very sensitive person.

[Shri Mataji gives Self-realization to the interviewer who feels a very strong cool breeze on top of his head.]

Yogini translating: Very strongly he feels the breeze on his head.

Shri Mataji: Oh Good. [Sounds like ‘This’] is the Power of Divine Love.

[Shri Mataji then briefly explains what has happened by referring to a chakra chart depicted in the pamphlet.]

Shri Mataji: This is the triangular bone. This [energy] rises through six centres. Ultimately pierces through the sixth one. And that’s how what he felt... You can have this [pamphlet] and you can see this.

Shri Mataji then autographs the pamphlet with the message: “With My love and blessings. Mataji Nirmala Devi”]

Yogini translating: I will keep it on my heart.

Yogini (to the interviewer): Ataturk was a realized soul.

Yogini: He is asking if the cameraman can also get his realization.

Shri Mataji: Yes, why not. He is carrying something heavy on his shoulder. Can he keep it down for a while?

Shri Mataji: (explaining a miracle photograph): That was [taken] on a boat, on a ride. That was the day, the 5th of May it was. There were all people sitting here around Me. That was the day (long time back) – was the 5th of May 1970 – when the Sahasrara was opened in India. This [the miracle photo] happened much later. We were in [name of place not audible, sounds like ‘Ischia’] and we were going by boat. At that same time this photo [sounds like ‘was taken’].

Yogini: The 5th of May?

Shri Mataji: Yes, [the] 5th of May. But much later – 10 years later.

Yogini translating: There are a lot of people sitting around You?

Shri Mataji: Yes, but you can’t see them. They have all disappeared on the sides.

Shri Mataji: This is the last photograph. But there are other photographs that show people first. And gradually they disappear.

Shri Mataji: Now this [another miracle photo] is another one. With the white saree, standing in the sea. And this light appeared in the heart, on My heart.

Shri Mataji: There are thousands of such photographs. Thousands of them.

Shri Mataji: [explaining another miracle photo] My whole face was covered with the light, very strong light. But the flowers are all right there, nothing happens to them.
