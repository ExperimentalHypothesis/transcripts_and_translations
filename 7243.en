[Note: One Yogini did a live translation into English, but the questions are different from the original questions of the journalist in Turkish language. So, in the subtitles, only the original Turkish questions are translated. Some of the Turkish questions are not heard in the video, just the English tranlations can be heard.]

Correspondent: They are picked from a garden, not bought from the florist.

Yogini [pointing to the bouquet offered to Shri Mataji]: They are from garden Mother! They are from garden. Collected for You.

Shri Mataji: Thank you, very kind of you. What‘s the name? What’s the name of these flowers?

Sahaja Yogini: She is asking what the name of the flower is?

Correspondent: I don`t know

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. Please sit down.

Correspondent: Here, the atmosphere here is talismanic as feeling like inside a lantern, for maybe this is psychologic or the natural ambiance of the environment.

Sahaja Yogini (translates): He feels himself different here, different atmosphere maybe because of the mystic looking, he feels very relaxed and comfortable, very.

Shri Mataji: Very good, absolutely good idea.

Sahaja Yogini. This is a very good thing that you feel this!

Correspondent: I wonder where Madame is coming from either the depths of Indian Ocean or pinnacles of Himalayas.

Sahaja Yogini: He is wondering whether if You are coming from the bottom of the Indian Ocean, or are You coming from the top of the Himalayas.

Shri Mataji: I am from the centre of India, just on the Tropic of Cancer. You see, tropic of cancer. Mecca is also on the Tropic of Cancer. That’s the only [sounds like ‘thing’]

Sahaja Yogini: Tropic of Cancer?

Shri Mataji: Yes, Cancer, what do you call - about 23 and a half degrees is called as the [Tropic of Cancer].

Sahaja Yogini: Turkish of cancer ....

Shri Mataji: What do you call and about that, at ....... came down

Correspondent: In fact, I intend to make a compliment. As She is very deep and a person in heights, I would like to compliment as how deep She is, how developed her inner being and how She is sitting ever highest peaks. I intended to make a compliment.

Sahaja Yogini: Actually, it came from his heart! He wanted to make an esprit. He said you are coming from depth, the depth is coming from inside of you. He says like this.

Shri Mataji: That’s true. India has a very deep culture, very deep spiritual culture. As you had Sufis here, we had many saints in our country.

Correspondent: What is the content of sorrow and patience? Indeed, how sorrow and patience is described in this context?

Sahaja Yogini translating: What is the state of suffering in the daily life? What is the meaning in life of suffering?

Shri Mataji: It comes out of ignorance. Because of ignorance and you are so much involved in the worldly life, you see, that’s why you feel the suffering. But if you can rise above that, you don’t feel the sufferings at all.

Sahaja Yogini: After these modern times, with the technology, people are getting more and more far from inside and from God and they are not connected.

Shri Mataji: They feel the suffering sometimes. They feel the suffering of these modern times much more.

Correspondent: There are coincidences in life important coincidences, are these coincidences in fact messages for human beings?

Sahaja Yogini: There are coincidences in life. Are these coincidences giving a message to the people?

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. They are messages. They are messages for us, to guide.

Sahaja Yogini: Do You mean when people get these messages, then they can progress towards God, to be closer and closer if they get the messages right?

Shri Mataji: Especially if they get the desire – the desire to know why all these problems, desire to know the truth, you see. When that starts coming up, then you take to the path of seeking.

Sahaja Yogini translating: God is always inside us, but the distance between God and us depends on what we do in our life. Is that right?

Shri Mataji: Because you cannot feel your Spirit, that’s why. If you can feel your Self, if you know your Self, then you are absolutely close to God Almighty.

Correspondent: Then in reality, worshipping is when a person set forth  from his/her house, is his/her conducts towards human beings, attitude towards life, when arriving at home praying with open palms in fact the whole daily life is worshipping to the God. Is it not?

Sahaja Yogini: In this case, praising to God means the way how we live our life, how we do the things... And even before go to bed, we open our hands and pray before we go to sleep. And to pray is the real praising of God.

Shri Mataji: It's true, but your heart must be clean. If your heart is not clean and if you are just praying to God, God knows everything.

Correspondent: We have to know that God knows. We must know that God knows. Human beings must feel that they are all the time under Gods governance

Sahaja Yogini: We should know [that] God knows everything is inside us.

Shri Mataji: Yes, He knows everything about us and He loves us. God loves us very much, He guides us. But if we do not want to listen to Him and want to listen to our own whims, then He says, “All right. Go ahead.”

Correspondent: Does Madame like to watch movies?

Sahaja Yogini: Do You like to watch movies?

Shri Mataji: Do you like to?

Sahaja Yogini: Do You like to watch movies, films?

Shri Mataji: Sometimes, yes I do, if there is a good one.

Sahaja Yogini: If there is beautiful films.

Correspondent: For instance, did she watch the “Titanic” movie?

Yogini translating: Did You see the movie ‘Titanic’?

Shri Mataji: I did. I did.

Correspondent: I would like to tell about a coincidence by the way, it was a film but a film that reflect the reality. As you know Titanic sank and there were two lovers. At that time, Rose was on the raft on ocean.

Sahaja Yogini: From the movie Titanic, he was very impressed for one part when the Titanic was under the water, they were just holding some wooden sticks and so on, but it was very cold in the night while he was in the water and girl was sitting on it and in the morning time boy was frozen and then, until that time they couldn’t make other people hear that they need help. At the end, just at last moment, just from the near, at that moment they could hear that she was alive, there is just one person who is alive. Is this a blessing from God­­?

Shri Mataji: Everything is a blessing from God and see the way He pay attention to things which are not important, then you suffer.

Correspondent: Did you commit a sin ever?

Sahaja Yogini: Do you have sins?

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogini: Have you ever made sins?

Shri Mataji: (just looks at them)

Sahaja Yogi: Sin, have you ever sinned?

Shri Mataji:  I can’t, very difficult!

Sahaja Yogini: Not possible for me. I can't.

Correspondent: I apoligise asking a question like this, but all of us are beings created by God. Sometimes it may happen that we commit sins. Audience may wonder, that's why I ask.

Sahaja Yogini: He says he is sorry to ask such a question to you but because all of us are created by God, we can make mistakes. That’s why he asked you if you ever made mistake.

Shri Mataji: I have not. I mean, from the worldly point of view, maybe. But from God’s point of view, not.

Correspondent: How She evaluates football? Is there any team that She supports in any country?

Sahaja Yogini: For example, football. Are you interested in football? Is there any team which you are supporting?

Shri Mataji: (Laughing) I never support any team, anywhere, because if you support, You cannot enjoy. You can keep a balance. When both parties are different things, I can never take .........??.

Correspondent: I heard a sentence in a song, a singer said so, there is Armenian, Greek, Muslim, Christian but the rain falling above us, wets all of us.

Sahaja Yogini: He heard a saying which he likes very much. There are Armenians, Turks and Christians, all the kinds but the rain always falls on all of them equally.

Shri Mataji: They are always equal. This is all man-made differences. God has not made that.  Because the thing that works out is your Realization, is the Kundalini, it's in all of you.

Correspondent:  We are all one for God but with our attitudes I am little away from God or I am a little closer to you or I am far away. We determine our proximity to God in fact. God is in equal distance to all of us.

Sahaja Yogini: God has created us equally. Only we are making the difference between God and us, personally.

Shri Mataji: That’s right. In a garden, you have all kinds of flowers but they grow out of the same Mother Earth, you see. So, there is no difference at all but in their own variety. To create a variety, the beauty of variety, there are different flowers.

Sahaja Yogini: Some black, some pink, some of them pink, black, red, different, different colors, the humans.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it is what it is, We are all like that also. There is no difference of each. They are all flowers, in the same way, we are only human beings, there is no difference.

Correspondent: Sorry, Does the humans are establishing tomorrow with the actions of today?

Sahaja Yogini: Are people preparing their future according to what they have done today?

Shri Mataji: They are. They are looking for, lots of people are looking for truth or looking for reality, no doubt.

Sahaja Yogini: What ever we do in this life, it also effects our children and whole society.

Shri Mataji: Also society.

Correspondent : Which kind of music Madame listens to? Now I am hearing a tune, this is probably Indian Music.

Sahaja Yogini: What kind of music you like? Now we are listening. This must be Indian music.

Shri Mataji: Every kind, I like Mozart, I like Vivaldi, I like every kind of music. Music is more beautiful, you see. There are different kinds, that’s all. I don’t like crazy loud ones. That breaks my ear.

Sahaja Yogini: Actually he said, the music should enter from ears to the heart, some of the music are just remaining in the ears.

Shri Mataji: No, no.

Sahaja Yogini: Not going to heart.

Shri Mataji: It blasts your heart

Sahaja Yogini: Sorry?

Shri Mataji: Blast, blast your heart

Correspondent: What is your message for the human beings?

Sahaja Yogini: What is your message for the human beings?

Shri Mataji: My message is that all of you have within yourself a power, in the triangular bone known as sacrum,' which is responsible for your further evolution. And this gives you a new awareness within you when it is awakened, you get collectively conscious. This is like a connection you have (pointing out the mike the correspondent has) you see, you have to be connected with Divine Power of love which is 'Ruh'.

Sahaja Yogini: Can we say for your Sahaja Yoga, it is the answer and the meaning of everything?

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. That is the solution. Because all problems are because of human beings who are ignorant. Once you become one with the Divine, all problems are solved.

Correspondent: Does Madame likes Turkish dishes, except those ones or does She likes these ones? What kind of food does She eats?

Sahaja Yogini: He would like to ask what do you like to eat in Turkey? Normally, he says all the foreigners they like to eat döner, sish kebab.

Shri Mataji: I like all kind of Turkish food. I think it is the best in the whole world.

Sahaja Yogini:  He says, it is no to up us to obtain the timing when, how everything should happen. There is a power who does everything. In his life, until he was 45, everything was very difficult, struggling on the ground he says. After when he was 45,  he said something must change and he says in his new life, this moment, the moment when he meets You, is the most special moment. This is a blessing from God and that’s why he is thanking to you.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Thank you very much to hear something like that. To me also, this is a great pleasure to meet you (looking at the yogini) because he is a very sensitive person.

Yogini (to the correspondent): Sit comfortably. Are you comfortable?

Shri Mataji: When you feel the cool breeze

Sahaja Yogini: Admit when you feel the cool breeze in your hands?

Correspondent: Cool breeze?

Sahaja Yogini: Breeze of the Sprit. This is the breeze of the Sprit.
