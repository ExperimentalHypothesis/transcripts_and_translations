Shri Mataji: very good, absolutely good idea.

Yogini. It is very good that you feel this.

Correspondent : In fact I intend to make a compliment. As She is very deep and a person in heights, I would like to compliment as  how deep She is, how developed her inner being and how She is sitting ever highest peaks.

Yogini: Actually, it came from his heart! He wanted to make an espri. He said you are coming from depth, the depth is coming from inside of you. He says like this.

Shri Mataji: That’s true. Indıa has a very deep culture, very deep culture, spiritual culturel, as you have Sufis, we have many saints in our country.

Correspondent : What is the content of sorrow and patience. Indeed how sorrow and patience is described in this context?

Yogini: What is the state of ...... suffering in the daily life? What is the meaning in life   .... suffering?

Shri Mataji: That comes out of  ignorance, because of ignorange and you are so much involve in the worldly life, that’s why you feel ignorance but if you can raise above that, you don’t feel suffing at all.

Yogini: After these modern times, with the technology , people are getting more and more far  from inside and from God and they are not connected.

Shri Mataji:They feel the suffering of the modern times much more.

Correspondent : There are coincidences in life, important coincidences, are these coincidinces in fact  messages for human beings?

Yogini: There are coincidence in life! Are these coincidence are given as a message to the people?

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, they are messages. They are messages for us to guide.

Yogini translating: Do you mean, when people get these messages, then they can go on the direction to the God to be closer and closer, if they get the signs rightly.

Shri Mataji: This really? get the desire, desire to know why all these problems, desire to know the truth, you see, When that starts coming up then you get to the path of secrets

Yogini: God is always inside us but the distance between God and us is up to what we do in our life. Is that right?

Shri Mataji: yes, because you cannot feel your spirit and that’s why. If you can feel yourself, if you know yourself, then you are absolutely close to God Almighty. Correspondent : Then, in reality worshipping is when a person set forth  from his/her house, is his/her conducts towards human beings, attitude towards life, when arriving at home praying palms open in fact the whole Daily life is worshipping to the God. Is it not?

Yogini: In this case, praising to God means that the way how we live our life, how we do the things and even when we are before we go to sleep to open our hands and to pray is the real praising to God

Shri Mataji: This is true, but your heart must be clean. If your heart is not clean and if you just pray to God, and God knows everything.

Yogini translating: God knows everything.

Correspondent : We have to know that God knows. We must know that God knows. Human beings must feel that they are all the time under Gods governance

Yogini: We should know always God know everything inside us.

Shri Mataji: Yeah, He knows everything about us, and he loves us. God loves us very much, He guides us, but if you do not want to listen to him and want to listen to your own .....................??  then he says Ok, go ahead.

Correspondent : Does She likes to watch movies.

Yogini: Do You like to watch movies?

Shri Mataji: Sometimes, yes I do, if there is a good one.

Yogini: I like if the movie is nice.

Correspondent : For instance, did She watch the movie “ Titanic” ?

Yogini: Did you see movie Titanic?

Shri Mataji: I did, I did.

Correspondent : I would like to tell about a coincidence by the way, it was a film but a film that reflect the reality. As you know Titatic sank and there were two lovers. At that time Rose was on the raft on ocean.

Yogini translating: From the movie Titanic, he was very impressed for one part when the Titanic was under the water, they were just holding some wooden sticks and so, but it was very cold in the night while he was in the water and girl was sitting on it and in the morning time boy was frozen and then, until that time they couldn’t make other people hear that they need help. At the end, just at last moment, just from the near, at that moment they could hear that there is just one person who is alive. She was alive. Is this a blessing from God­­?

Shri Mataji: Everything is a blessing from God and see the way they pay attention to things which are not important then you suffer.

Correspondent : Did you commit a sin?

Yogini: Do you have sins?

Shri Mataji: What?

Yogini: Have you ever made sin?

Shri Mataji: (just looks at them)

Yogi: Sin, Have you ever sinned?

Shri Mataji:  I can’t, very difficult!

Yogini: Not possible for me. I cant.

Correspondent : I apoligise asking a question like this but all of us are beings created by God. Sometimes it may happen that we commit sins. Audience may wonder thats why I ask.

Yogini: He says he is sorry to ask such a question to you but because all of us is created by God  we can make mistakes. That’s why he asked you if you ever made mistake.

Shri Mataji: I am not, I mean from the worldly point of view me, maybe, but from the God’s point of view, No.

Correspondent : I heard a word from a song a singer said so, there is Armenian, Orthodox, Muslim, Christian but the rain falling above wets all of us.

Yogini: He heard a saying which he likes very much. There are Armenains, Turks, Christians, all the kinds but the rain always falls to all of them equally.

Shri Mataji: They are always equal. This is all man-made differences. God has no .............??  Because the thing that works out in realization is the Kundalini is in all of you.

Correspondent : We are all one for God but with our attitudes I am little away from God or I am a little closer to you or I am far away. We determine our proximity to God in fact. God is in equal distance to all of us.

Yogini: God created us equally. Only we are making the distance between God and us personally.

Shri Mataji: There are flowers, there are all kinds of flowers, but they grow on the same mother  earth. So there is no difference at all. But in their own variety, to create the varity, the  beauty of variety. They have different colors.

Yogini translating: Some black, some pink, some of them pink, black, red, different, different colors, the human.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it is what it is, We are all like that also. there is no difference of each. They are all flowers, in the same way we are only human beings, there is no difference.

Yogini: What kind of music you like? Now we are listening, this must be Indian music

Shri Mataji: Every kind, I like Mozart, I like Vivaldi, I like every kind of music. Music is more beautiful, you see. There are different kinds, that’s all. I don’t like crazy loud music. That breaks my ear.

Yogini translating: Actually he said, the music should enter from ears to the heart, some of the music are just remaining in the ears

Shri Mataji: No,no.

Yogini: not going to heart.

Shri Mataji: it blasts your heart

Yogini: sorry

Shri Mataji: blast, blast your heart

Yogini translating: What is your message for the human beings?

Shri Mataji: Message is that all of you have within yourself a power, in the triangular bone known as sacrum which is responsible for your further evolution. And this gives you a new awareness within you when it is awakened, you get collectively conscious. This is like a connection you have (pointing out the mike the correspondent has) you see, you have to be connected with Divine Power of love which is Ruh.

Yogini translating: Can we say for your Sahaja Yoga, it is the answer and the meaning of everything.

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. That is the solution.  because all problems are because of human being who are ignorant, once you become one with the Divine, all problems are solved.
