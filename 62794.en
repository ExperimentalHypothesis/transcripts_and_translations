Showers, the one which showers, ambrosia and it is in Ektal. Ektal as you know is in twelve beats and he'll tell you, it is always in a slow pace. Ektala is very slow. So first in according to Indian style of our music, first we build up the foundation with a very meticulous method and it is built not in a hurry or a fast or a speedy way. So the first the foundation is made like that, then gradually it is raised as your own being is first grounded properly and then it is gradually built up into a beautiful theme. I mean it's a complete creation, it's a theme, you can call it a complete architecture. You can call it a complete cosmos of the particular raga but I have never heard this raga, I'm very happy that Ajith has decided to sing such a beautiful raga to me. May God bless you and him, all of them.
