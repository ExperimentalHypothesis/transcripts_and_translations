“Going from Swaha to Swadha,” Shri Mataji’s residence, 48 Brompton Square, London (England), 3 March 1986.

This was the last thing I used in my lectures, in Delhi; that Shri Krishna has said that the human awareness goes downward and the roots of the human awareness are in the brain. And when human beings start going downward they move in the opposite direction of the Divine. That’s all He has said. He’s not said more than that. 

Now see, what happens [is] that you are born in the Bhavasagara, at that time. Now, when the human awareness starts growing, what is the essence of Bhavasagara is swaha and the aim is swadha. 

Swaha means consumption: consumption of all the poisons, consumption of everything. 

And swadha is the one [which] means: the swa is the Spirit and dha means the one that sustains. So the dharma of Spirit when it comes into you, then you become a guru.

So in the Bhavasagara it is swaha and swadha. So from swaha you have to move to swadha.

If you come to swadha state then the Mahalakshmi is awakened within you and you start rising higher. So it is called as ‘urdhvagati’ ( ऊर्ध्वगति) : going to the ascent side. 

The descent side is called as ‘adhogati’ (अधोगति). Now adhogati starts because to go down is very easy, first of all. Secondly when you are on the steps, on top, you see the steps very nice, done with nice platforms to go down, but you don’t see the heights. You just go down, easily. 

So the first step you come onto is the Swadishthana. But before that the step of the Nabhi, which is swaha, is the consumption: it starts acting in the awareness. Then you start consuming: attacking other countries, taking those countries and going to them and overpowering them and getting others. So as you say the imperialism, that kind of a thing starts. Thank God Columbus went that side! As I have said many-a-times.

Now, when you have done that, then you start also digging out your Mother Earth and consuming Her things and through your machinery and all that, you start doing it.

Then the second point is that, when you go a little lower, then you go into Swadishthan which is antariksha, which is called as bhurva. Antariksha means all the universe, universes. So you start going to the stars; you start going to that. I mean, it is of no avail, unnecessary. You have to go within. You have to go higher. You have to go urdhvagati. But you start going to these and feeling very happy, “Oh, we are going to moon!” You are going to sun, you are going...what are you going to get out of it, God alone knows!

And when that happens then, after that, you come to Mooladhara. Awareness has to grow. And once you come to Mooladhara then you start [becoming] absolutely depraved, or you become perverted. You start all kinds of funny ideas about sex. I mean, you don’t know what to do with the sex: eat it or dump it or do what you like. And that’s how we become. And one step forward and you are in hell - direct!

So that’s how the decadence of all these [happens]. I mean, if you see the television or anything you don’t know what are these people up to! What’s this? Going from bad to worse! Idiots, I tell you! Idiotic! Like Pelsham marrying his secretary: all this nonsense, is idiotic. This idiocity comes in because of this downward movement. So you go downward and go to hell and finish off.

Now when the human awareness little bit tries to go upward also, without going through the Mahalakshmi process, then it comes to the heart where it is mana - is the heart. And then you start giving your heart to this person and heart to that person and all this romance and all that. So you go like that and again you come down.

But, when you start the steps from downward (below), the first step when you start, what you see is the height [to which] you have to rise. To what? To your innocence, to your chastity. And you rise on that. Then going upwards you see other things. While going down you see other things.

Now then, from there, you go to the other higher level of bhurva, is the creation. Then you become creative. You see to the aesthetics. That’s why they don’t understand aesthetics. I am not surprised! Their aesthetics are becoming bland, nonsensical, funny. Absolutely it has no meaning. It is not connected with any creativity. Human creativity has gone down. It’s all machine creativity. You go to plastics, this, that, and we start appreciating all that is modern. You cannot appreciate anything that has been and which could be better. 

Instead of that you are accepting something so insipid and so horrible. Because of bhurva you come to the prithvi tattwa and you start becoming materialistic; you become materialistic, money-oriented, at the Nabhi Chakra. Absolutely money-oriented, no dharma, nothing. No dharma at all; because swadha is not there. But while going up  you get aesthetics; you become aesthetically rich. You understand aesthetics because you feel the vibrations of the thing. Anything you appreciate. You appreciate this house because you have vibrations. Without vibrations you would like to have something, what you call an insipid place, some funny looking, jazzy, nonsensical disco-like place. I mean, that’s the end of it: a disco-like place. Imagine! Imagine a disco compared to this house!

Then you go higher, you go on to the Nabhi. Then at Nabhi point what it becomes is dharma. You enjoy your virtues. You enjoy it: enjoy to be virtuous. And then you become swadha, and in that way he becomes a guru. 

You go to the heart, then you become compassion. It expands! It expands. While the downward movement makes you smaller, smaller, smaller, till you become a sex point and then to hell. 

Then it expands your heart. When it expands your heart you become compassion and love and generosity.

Then janah: janah is higher. Now the same awareness, human awareness, when it goes on its own, it becomes political orators, political this, political that: is janah, is going to the public. 

Janah is here [at Vishuddhi] because He’s Virata. So you become attached to things where you have a popularity. It’s a very cheap type, there’s nothing deep in it. Like Mrs. Thatcher coming now. And now they’ll call her ‘thatcherite’, then ‘thatcherism’ and all kinds of views are coming up. Then another is this Heath! I mean, not only in this country but Reagan, this, that, all of them are horrible!

So that happens. That is trying to solve some issues. This should not be done; that should not be done. But there’s no peace. Peace has to be established. That cannot be established by this. So that also, such people who are politically motivated, they also go down. Up to Vishuddhi Chakra.

Then here, when you rise, is the people who say, “Oh, we must sacrifice this. We must do this and we must achieve this through sacrifices!” Tapas, tapas they do. Like going to wars, this that, they also fall out.

But here [at Agnya] is tapasya for God.

And then we come to Sahasrara. Sahasrara is satya, is the truth. You discover the truth. You will have to know the truth here, because these are the roots. And that’s what you have got it. You have got the truth, now with you.

And that’s why the people here, the decadence can be understood. They don’t understand colour, you know. Even they said, say for my bathroom, this thing, they are very particular in bathrooms: “Should be white!” “It’s ivory.” What’s wrong with ivory colour? Even that they won’t have.

And now the faces they are painting white, trying to look pale. Just imagine! Like death. Like, walking like deaths. They don’t like colours: how will they have flowers? Nature is full of colours. Don’t do, they don’t like any colour. Even they don’t like transparent things, they want to have it coloured white, ghastly as that is. They look ghastly, don’t they? And why these people appreciate, is because there is decadence. No colour, nothing, just insipid. No designs. It’s terrible. It’s terrible things are happening!

Out of that you all have come out. I must thank you for that. The way you have risen from that low-level atmosphere. Such a low-level atmosphere: think of it. They will die out. Like hippies came, they died out, they finished. The other will come; they will die out. But those who are rising are the people who are important to us.

I mean, imagine, you think of hippies, where would they be? Absolute complete decadence, absolute, finished people! Wearing rags, this, that.

There’s a Hong Kong fellow who is selling jeans. So I said, “What is the speciality about your jeans?” He said, “You see, these are washed in a washing machine, in which there are stones.” So I said, “Then what happens?” “Then it becomes, you know, a little oldish.” They put stones and the stone [washed jeans] are sold in the market. Such idiocity, I tell you! And they are the most expensive jeans! Such decadence, such decadence.

When are you going through your head, to Sahasrara?

So the Sahaj Yog, it is possible through Kundalini; there’s no other way out. Krishna didn’t say about it because He didn’t know whether Arjuna would understand or not. But in a way he did. 

Did you get the book, Geeta Enlightened? It’s nice.

Sahaj Yogi: No, I haven’t seen. This is of Yogi’s (Yogi Mahajan)?

Shri Mataji: Ha. I’ll give you. We inaugurated it. I’ll give you one. It’s come out very well, I’ll give you. I’ve got upstairs in my room.
