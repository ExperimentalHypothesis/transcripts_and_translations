"Give up Misidentifications". Dollis Hill ashram, London (UK). 22 April 1979.

And because of the cleansing of the Feet of Christ, this is why should we make such a lot of [voice?] we can sell it and give it to the poor and Christ said - now see what He said - that Christ Himself has said these words and if they are depicted the same way you just see the meaning [what it should be?].  He said that these poor are forever but I am for a short time. You see? How clearly He has said that there is no philosophic work involved. But people take, you see the other meaning I don't know from where you get the other meaning that you must look after the poor. That's not your job at all. All right, [people?]? That's not your job to look after the poor.  What we have to work out in the middle by which we can put the right and the left both the balance. You have to be in the middle, and then in the middle course - we first of all settle down ourselves nicely and then the left and right can be in [condition?]. The poor and the rich - the over rich are horrid people. They smoke, they drink, I mean they are rich, gambling this, that, all sorts of things they do, they waste their lives, they don't know how to face themselves, they are in the worst possible condition.

And the poor are another style [labor class and all].

So you have to bring them to the center. But how? You yourself have the depth within you. You can pull all of them together. First solution has to come in the second part.. All right? So this is it, and when you start doing your philosophic work you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot be. Of course, I mean poor is all right, in the Indian religions [they OR I] can work it out. But very poor, they will not take to Sahaja Yoga. They'll take to drinking, smoking, or if some time is left, [gambling?] or cheating. They will take to these things. Because for them eating is the main thing. It's just like animals. And for the very rich - they are another type of animals. They are vultures.  They cannot live without sort of [parasites ?]. If you tell them anything they will not understand. So, the upper class [UNCLEAR]. Lower class. [UNCLEAR].  Ours is the middle class .

...It has to settle down in the values of Sahaja Yoga. And then once they see if the river flows, they can be enriched and they become [UNCLEAR] and we have to enrich both the banks. This side or that side. That is important. One side you have to cleanse the upper class and the lower class you have to enrich them. But if you do not have that in yourselves how are you going to do it? Sahaja Yoga is going to work for the middle class. This is the point. Not for the poorer level. And that's a very wrong thing that attention is put to that. That's not our job. We are not creating poor. Are we? We are not. Who has created? The upper class. [UNCLEAR] So they say we have [labor?] government - both are just the same.

That's interesting. They say by denying God, they are challenging God. Deny God then God will fall on their feet. That's why they deny. Otherwise what is the need? What matters, is he standing for any election? You are contesting any election that you are saying you do not believe in God. What does it matter? So that is how we understand, that these are fools.

(One lady from audience asks, "Is there any way, Mother [INAUDIBLE].")

Shri Mataji: That's what I said that the way is that the middle class, see the middle class should be there.

(Someone from the audience talks to Shri Mataji, "But for these people could [UNCLEAR] to say, 'I do not believe, I challenge' [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: Then let it be. You don't make them believe.

(One lady from audience asks, "Is there any way of helping them to make them understand the becoming, to understand you............?")

Shri Mataji: You see, if you think that you can make these people believe, you can't, it's not. They will not. They will not. Because the more you'll try to reach, the more they [INAUDIBLE]. Because, people you see, their ego is hurt.  They are the people whose ego is hurt. Because they find some people rich.  Say, the person on this bank and this bank.  This is [UNCLEAR].  We are somewhere [UNCLEAR] all right? And they are [feeling or FEDING]... each other. So their ego is hurt. Very much.  And here there are people who are egoistical. So both do not believe in God. What does it matter if they believe it or not? There is God.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji.)

Shri Mataji: You see, they just want to say it out. Here it is a big word. I've seen everywhere. I believe. Now, who are you? Everyone, you see it, I believe. I mean, believing, from where it has come? From where did you get this belief? What is your experience? So that's how they do. So they have to say if a politician comes up and gives a lecture. I believe that this is this. So everybody hears that. So they want more. I believe in this. This is [UNCLEAR] one bell, putting into another bell and the resonance stars and everyone whistles I believe. You see, I find in this country, even an ordinary beggar talks like that.

There is no humility of any kind. That's why they talk like that. They lack of humility. They are so aggressive. Just how aggressive they are.  They have aggressed all the cultures of the world. Now today's article, I brought it for you to see especially, you see now, a [UNCLEAR], whatever they have done [THEY HAVE TO BE GENTLE TO EACH OTHER or THEY HAVE HURT EACH OTHER ?]. So an English lady writes about. She said they have made our body... You see now, your attitude towards life, you can say a British attitude or you can say a western attitude is that your body is very beautiful so you must show it. Why, why cheat yourself? It is not because your body is beautiful but you want to catch it. It's simple. It is as simple as that. Face it. But you want all the world, all over the world the women should be like you. It's such a subtle aggression you don't know. They have killed all the cultures of the world with this kind of an understanding that we are the best, you see, the most educated and sophisticated.

But others also must exist. They have their own cultures, understand them and if you do not say, "Please, give me this", then he's uncultured. This, you know, it is such a subtle aggression you could see on everybody's cultures. That's how they have removed all the Indians, from, say, South America, North America, you see. Everywhere where ever these people have gone they have finished the cultures. It's a very, very special type of aggression and aggression has a reaction always. Either the other cultureÂ´s people, those people who have other cultures, would strive to be discultured because this is supposed to be the greatest of all. To say like that, that we should not be afraid of showing, we should not be ashamed of our body.  What is something like privacy within us? Is there nothing like privacy? We should respect our bodies after all.  Now if this is the attitude taken, that everybody, "Ooo, this women is [indigenous?] because she does not show off her body." The showing off of the body is nothing but, means a subtle prostitution. This is on, and on, and on. It's very subtle. Now another suggestion comes in from there, that for 25 years they cannot believe that people can remain celibate. Because in this country people can't. But there are so many countries where they really remain celibate till the age of, till they are married. So many of them. But according to them it is not possible, so, those who remain must be wrong, they are telling lies, and they cause this on others that you become like us, because our noses are cut so you also cut your nose.

Of all types of people you go anywhere, all the western people have got a culture, it's a variety of cultures and such subtle cultures they have used to love it. And by their aggression they have told people that we are sort of the highest of others. English language you must know, French you must know,

So, you see, what I am saying is when we understand we have to change we must know we have to be really humble, not in language, not in behavior, but inside, to know that we do not aggress others. All right? So this labor has this far problem is only of aggression. One community here. Say, now, say, you take an elite person, so called elite. That's why I say [INAUDIBLE] they have made a big [satire?] on all the ladies, the dancing of [it?], they have made a big [satire?] on all the upper classes and all the lower classes and all that [style?] So very good one, I must say. It is a very good [satire?], no doubt.  ItÂ´s a very good [ satire?].

So now, if you have that aggression within you existing, then better take it out. The culture of the spirit has come. That is the [INAUDIBLE]. If that culture doesn't come, you see, then these all cultures are really [aggressive ?] and they can never give any happiness to anyone. Labor people think that they are hurt by the [UNCLEAR] or by the rich or poverty. But what are they aspiring to be? They are aspiring to be the rich people themselves. They are hurt by the rich and they want to be the rich.  It could be like if you are hurt by somebody, should you become [UNCLEAR] yourself. If you are hurt by the rich people then why do you want to be rich? It's a simple question.  For a person like Me, who has no [materialistic ?] I cannot understand.

(Question from the public, "Let me say something about all these thesis. [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: Yes.

(Question: "[UNCLEAR] and then You have the middle subtler and what You are saying is right [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: But I said you liberals also need Realization. They have to be reborn. Otherwise you will have one horrible [genuine ?] thought, "Why did you give him this thing. You gave him a seat, why should we give a seat?". You should have courage to say, "Better not give. He has got a seat."

(From the audience, "He's going back there.")

(From the audience, "He's going back to his seat. He's standing for his seat again.")

Shri Mataji: But I tell you what. You see, unless and until they take to Realization, it will not.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji.)

Shri Mataji: See? What I am telling just by proposing that you are in the center you do not become. Sahaja Sahaja you see? Kabira has said it, "Sahaja Sahaja. [UNCLEAR]" They all said Sahaja, Sahaja.. What they are?  You should be ashamed of such a horrible leader you had for so many days.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji.)

Shri Mataji: No, no, horrible he is. Just see his vibrations. Horrible person. No, no, no. All of them are just the same  to Me all of them are just the same - there is nothing to choose. But if you have a choice, if you ....

Question from the audience: [UNCLEAR] Ours is an aggressive nation. I don't like to say that we are an aggressive nation [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. You are not aggressive when it comes to something else. But when it comes to cultures, you are aggressive.

(Question from the audience, "I admit when we came to India we didn't know what we were doing, so we cut off from it and we wouldn't have anything to do with it.")

Shri Mataji: What English brought from India? Pajamas, Jodhpurs, verandahs [UNCLEAR]

(Person from audience, "Sandals.")

Shri Mataji:  And what else? So, you are. You see? All these things have to be changed, like Indians must change and they should not accept whatever you give them.

(Person from audience, "Our aim of being in India was not an aggressive one. And we weren't aggressive.")

Shri Mataji: In India?

(Person from audience, "I don't like [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: You did not like it but you have had it, you see? You don't know how they treated us. You have no idea ...

(Person from audience, "[UNCLEAR] India [UNCLEAR] ironic [UNCLEAR]. You. I want to know why in India they say, 'Only one God [is running?] UNCLEAR.'")

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] If you pay money ...

(Person from audience, "[I know?] Indians who like Germans for kicking us out because they say without a second world war.")

Shri Mataji: No, no, I tell you very simple.  Just I will I will. Listen, listen. Actually you will understand it is very simple if you listen to Me. You see? It is support. You give them money, they give, you see, [UNCLEAR] and they give these, you see, we never had these - like they call somebody's seeking. What you call [THIS or THESE] [UNCLEAR] and all that that you have. Titles, they gave titles and they gave this and that. You know, English know how to do it. And they collected some people to say something about it and then [UNCLEAR]. You don't know. You were not there.

(Person from audience, "Have you seen [UNCLEAR] best film made in India?")

Shri Mataji: That's what you people say because he says it is all about our poverty. He doesn't know anything about Indian culture. Not a word. He doesn't know anything about spirituality. Forget it! He is all right, people like him because he sees the saga of communism. That's all. That's what he's. He never represents Indians. It's all right, he is very good at [UNCLEAR]. Very old people have somewhere showing on their [UNCLEAR] stomach.

(Person from audience talking.)

Shri Mataji: That's how he does and people like it, because there is a kind of [UNCLEAR]. You like to see powers.  You like to see some people being tortured because we feel we are tortured.  It's very satisfying I tell you. You are a different person; you cannot understand it [what people are?].  But now you are different. I am not talking about the people who came to India but I am saying today also as the western mind is. You see, with your rationality, with your, what you call - is so called scholarships that you have, the so called - we can say the industrial...

(Person from audience speaking, "Indians [UNCLEAR] over board [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: That's what I am saying. You see, this is what I am saying. The same thing as you, see, I am saying the same thing. You are giving them and they are cheating.   Then it is poison [UNCLEAR] This is what I am saying. They are another type of person. You are one type, they are another type. You see, you aggress and they take it.  If anything goes from India they will accept. If they see something coming, they react. It's a funny thing going on [UNCLEAR].

(Person from the audience, "[UNCLEAR] are always coming out [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: That's what I am saying. You take from them they are another [UNCLEAR].    They are sending some gurus to you, you accept them. And you see, this is the mutual understanding going on.  It is a big fraternity on Earth.

(Person from the audience, "[UNCLEAR] after all, [UNCLEAR] the fantastic [UNCLEAR] for them.")

Shri Mataji: See now, you see the joke. Once you say that we are British or not, finished. Dead. You just say you are human beings then you can see the whole joke. If I say I am an Indian, I'm gone. Finished.   See, it's not politically, it's much higher. You see, you do not identify yourself with any [UNCLEAR].  If you are identified then you cannot.

(Person from the audience, "[UNCLEAR]")

Shri Mataji: If you listen to Me, the whole thing you'll understand very clearly, what I am trying to say. Don't get angry. When I am saying aggression is there, aggression, you see, this, you see, what I do not understand that people do not [study others?]. And just bring about your own idea [on others?]. That's great damage. Now, in My own house, My two daughters are there. I have not told them what is [UNCLEAR]. Can you believe?  Can you believe?  Even not told them what is Kundalini. [UNCLEAR] Even not given Realization..[INAUDIBLE]  If they do not want, I am not going to have.  This is [UNCLEAR].

But that doesn't mean I accept aggression from them. So, when you accept aggression is the same as you give aggression. If you do agree. For Me, both things are the same. So, when we have to change ourselves, we should say, "What do we do? What, where are we? Are we aggressing others or are we taking aggression?" Now, say, I could feel guilty. Then you are taking in aggression. If you feel like egoistical way that this is wrong, that is wrong, then you are aggressing others. All these things must be clear understood from inside, the view of the whole.  So you will understand.  But what happens, we identify ourselves with one part of... we say this is ego and either we aggress others in that case or we take aggression. This is it. This is a kind of... Anytime this happens, sickness starts and this is the cause of sickness of all human beings all over the world. But once you identify yourself with the whole then you start seeing more as a disease thing. And then you feel treating that disease as a doctor. Then you do not identify yourself with any sickness. All right? That is what these are.

So, now if you have somebody sick - all right, so now you understand that by helping that particular sick [UNCLEAR] because you are one with the whole.  But the approach towards that sickness is that... You understand my point? Is one way to help because he's sick, is poor, is different. What I am saying the approach should be that we become absolutely confident of Sahaja Yoga. We establish our own powers. Absolutely. And then we make them also the same because if they fall sick, they'll have all problems unless and until they are [INAUDIBLE]. So that is the primary thing that must work out. Because, one side they are the people whose ego is hurt, the other side are the people who [have something from their ego?].If you have to raise both of them you have to bring them to the center. All right? You understand my point now? Now, to bring them in the center is not true, sort of appease not that. But by developing the center. See, let the center grow first on both sides.  So, it [UNCLEAR].

They will never believe in God because that is the way they can assert their Ego. Indians are another [UNCLEAR], absolutely [UNCLEAR]. Because the way they are following you people I mean you are already in the beach, why you have to [UNCLEAR]. Firstly, they do not have any values about, you see [honesty?]. That's finished. Now if they take otherwise also they [UNCLEAR]. A thief becomes a moral person. Now what will happen? It's like somebody has been bitten by a scorpion and on top of that he [takes wine?]. And what happens?

So aggression is within, which is [UNCLEAR]. For all realized souls it is important to see if we are taking any aggression within us is equally wrong as giving aggression. You see, we have to develop the set of people who have idea of reality. Those who understand what is reality. Those who are going to settle another type of way, which way [sat down ?] this vicious circle. We have to have that kind of mind by which we see the disease of the whole and try to correct it.  That's how it [INAUDIBLE]. But if you start identify, even today, I would say - with anyone of them, you are mistaken. Now you understand My point? You just don't identify with anyone of them. You have to identify yourselves with reality, with your Self - to begin with. When you become that...

(Person from the audience, "Nirguna!")

Shri Mataji: Not necessarily Nirguna. [UNCLEAR]. Because I am in Saguna, what to do? If you do not come in Saguna is with forms, if you do not come in the form, nobody understands, who will talk to you? Nirguna cannot talk to you. So the Saguna had to come, all right. Now you establish within yourself the complete understanding of the Saguna. Now, don't doubt too much, if you are a doubting [UNCLEAR] you'll end up at [UNCLEAR], I can tell you so.  We have had people for years together. There is one gentleman coming for seven years [UNCLEAR] and he's supposed to be [rangular?] in mathematics. So, you can see the people who have understood the Saguna and how far they have got. And if you have to progress you try to understand first.

Secondly, you must also understand that you are going to be the people who are going to lead the whole world into a new awareness, into a new life, into a new dimension. So don't identify with people, who are still blind, who do not see. They'll make you more blind. Identify yourself with people who have seen something. People who have had experiences [UNCLEAR]. Put your attention to them, then only you can see. And that is only possible when you start giving up your misidentifications. You see? As long as you have misidentifications you will be mad. You will not know what to do. That's [easy?]. You got involved into these identifications naturally see because atmosphere is like that, whole surrounding is like that, from all sides you are people who just [linger?] they club you.  They have to [JOLLY WELL COME IN TO or RUN AWAY FROM] you. You feel [UNCLEAR]. You are not free to come out. And that's how you are not free from misidentifications. To begin with you are all right, but gradually you start facing [UNCLEAR] end up identify [UNCLEAR].

How are you responsible for what your forefathers have done in this country, or My forefathers have done in My country? Tell Me. Who are they to you? They might have been born in China with chinky eyes.  Possible. Or could be [UNCLEAR], or could be running away [UNCLEAR] as soldiers. Could be anywhere. We are not responsible for them whatever they have done. All right?  Keep it to that point.

Now, if you feel responsible - say, even for anyone who belongs to your tribe, still is wrong. Because you are decent people.  When you become that you must identify your self with the new tribe. Why, who has known the reality? But you will be identified very easily with something so much illusion like if you are born in England you are English, if you are born in [INAUDIBLE]. You could have been born in Singapore, or any place. These all misidentifications [UNCLEAR]. Then with these identifications also you go into that complete circle. If you are an Indian, you start speaking like an Indian, behave like an Indian or all these [UNCLEAR] everything [UNCLEAR]. You see, why did you start deciding [UNCLEAR]. But you are a pure thing inside. These all impurities come to you. So to free yourself from all these impurities, of any kind, I tell you this is like possession in you. To be free absolutely from all these things [UNCLEAR]. All these ideas when they come into your head, [UNCLEAR] - that all these have come to us because we belong to a particular society, particular race, particular religion. Now, for example the other day you know there was a gentleman.  He said, "I feel very guilty all the time." I said, "Are you a Catholic." He said, "No." I said, "You have no business to feel guilty." Because if you are a Catholic, you are made to feel guilty all the time. [UNCLEAR]. You think you are just from childhood. If somebody gets brain washed all the time, see, a little child doesn't understand. Go on telling, "You are a sinner." He will say, "Oh! Am I a sinner?" Then he goes to the church. Then they tell you, "You are a sinner."

(Person from the audience, "You must confess.")

(Person from the audience, "Repent, repent, repent, repent.")

Shri Mataji: Repent, repent. [UNCLEAR] For what should I repent? So you think about it. He goes to the priest and he tells him that, "I repent for one thing." He said, "What?".  "Because I opened the tap." He said, "What?". "I opened the tap. [INAUDIBLE] I repent for that." It starts from there, you see? And the whole thing starts working out, then poor thing repents for something else. But inside, very innocently building up [UNCLEAR]. And that's how horrible people took [UNCLEAR]. All of them just the same. But I am saying about [UNCLEAR] how they have [UNCLEAR]. One thing [UNCLEAR]. You make somebody feel guilty and you have it. Absolutely satanic. Is there any mention in the Bible that Christ wanted somebody to confess anything? Is there anything mentioned like this?

(Persons from the audience, "No, no.")

Shri Mataji: Then why these people have started these confessions, [INAUDIBLE] who are they compared to Christ that they ask for confession? Appointed by some theological college? Elected by some people that the smoke comes out of the chimney.

All these silly things you digest all thinking about it and then you are misidentified also Maria. All right? So, you must understand. Be happy and joyous that you have found that eternal life. And be one with it. All right. And you tell them off that you are all silly fools. You go ahead with your idiocy and when you are absolutely drowned, then come to you.

(Person from the audience speaking. [UNCLEAR].)

Shri Mataji: Why? You see, spiritually is true [UNCLEAR]. Say, [UNCLEAR] they have all these horrible tantrika, this, that. As long as we [UNCLEAR], you see if they are countries like, you can say, say tantrikas are mostly prevalent in Bengal, in Bihar, in U.P., in Kerala, in Madras, Assam and there you find the [UNCLEAR]. And maximum are in Bihar, with the poorest. It's an absurdity.  There is a place we went to Kovlam.  It is in Kerela.  The people are extremely poor and for the newspaper people, you see, this is a way they should have that poverty.  They want to sort of take advantage of their poverty, as if they are very poor, live like poor. And these people are very [UNCLEAR] in a hall it was carpet or something, I don't know what it is.  So they published that she was living in a [suits of?] with what else, wall-to-wall carpet and this non-sense. I was forcing living with these people. But why? Because they wanted to imply that she lives in luxury or whatever it is. See, I live always in luxury whether [UNCLEAR]. So, this is what is the accent they had.  But why there is poverty, why don't they think? You know in that country such a rigid condition is that Shri Shankaracharya was born and these people told Me that we do not know who he was and also we do not know that he was born in this country.  They should be ashamed of this.

And the second thing that they did that they tortured him because when he came back and his mother was sick, they did not even give him water, they said you are a sanyasi, you have no business to come to your mother. And they would not; when she died they would not burn her. So, he burnt her in the house and then told them, 'banana tree, banana tree', Banhara and then he cursed that country that, "The way I have burnt my mother, you will be doing the same." So now, they cannot burn. So what they do? They dig [UNCLEAR] and put them just in front of the house. Imagine every house is hovered by all the thousands of horrible people who are there. We went to one village and the condition of the house [INAUDIBLE].

It's only one setting in you, you just say go away all of you. That's all. It will work out.

So, you see, for, we had an example of that in Bombay and Delhi. We had those Ramakrishna mission people just tell them. There was a lady who had cancer from the same ashram and she said, "Why I was with the whole cult as I was helping others, I was looking after them?" I said, "Then why did you get cancer?" She said, "Now [UNCLEAR - INDIAN WORDS ALSO] I've got it." So I said, "You enjoy it now. You all wait for it for Upkar [Hindi word - helping others - ed]. You just do it without doing it. You even do not know you are doing it.  It's so simple." All right?

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, otherwise, you see, you think you're doing something - that is pride comes into you and the whole thing is spoiled.

(Person from the audience, "Mother, the more we surrender, the more we have faith, the more it will be all right?")

Shri Mataji: Yes, it will be all right. You see, if you are all right, if you are strong people, in the Virata becomes all right, [INAUDIBLE] you become strong. [UNCLEAR] some part of the body [INAUDIBLE] how many cells [INAUDIBLE].

But we are the fighting cells.  We have to fight them.  My love becoming identified with them. You see, you have to fight with them in such a way that you do not weep for them. Nor shall affected by them. No, you [ARE DETACHED or HAVE TO CATCH]. You just say with your [UNCLEAR]. [INAUDIBLE] [BECAUSE or BUT] once you start weeping for them, power will [UNCLEAR]. It should be done without any [INAUDIBLE]. It's all right. [INAUDIBLE].

If somebody is cured, well and good, - we have not taken everybody's sort of bond, should we? We will do if you want to, if you don't want   [UNCLEAR]. It's in complete freedom that you do. [UNCLEAR] It's an absolute freedom. If I want to do, I will do, other wise I will not do. In the same way, you should surrender [UNCLEAR]. That is complete freedom.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji, "Sometimes, [INAUDIBLE].")

Shri Mataji: I feel that you should say now I understand. That what was that and I have too much feeling for you you become sahaja yogis. You see, they always depended on Me and you have to be. No doubt. [UNCLEAR]. Though Sahaja Yoga you can become [UNCLEAR]. I want you to become that. This is sitting [AROUND or DOWN ] and weeping for somebody. Some people are like this also.

You see, they like to show off. [INAUDIBLE]. But for a person like Me, I am just an ordinary woman, a housewife. Why should I?  I am not that. But then you see, people like [UNCLEAR]. That's not [it?]. [UNCLEAR] You are not [curing them?], you are not feelingless, you are not emotional. But you are emotional. Emotion is [UNCLEAR]. You understand? You are emotional. You generate emotions. And you are the people who [UNCLEAR]. But nobody's emotion should affect you. Even the ocean cannot be.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji, "[UNCLEAR] which was the problem that all the one [UNCLEAR] [detached from?] their emotional side of the body and because of that they would be upset - why they could not attract my attention. You see, my attention was attracted but not to the point that become [UNCLEAR]. That would upset them. That's why I had the problem because they sent very negative vibrations back, which eventually I could not tolerate and [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: You should be tactful about it.  You should be tactful about it.  That is not the thing.  Only thing is see [UNCLEAR] it does not matter as long as it doesn't work inside. It's all outside. ItÂ´s all right. You see, attention when you give to somebody, you should be fully attentive to this.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji, "The attention [Mother, what do they need it?] because of selfish one, [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji:  [UNCLEAR] all kinds of [UNCLEAR]. You see, what I am saying is that as you are realized souls, means you are even [INAUDIBLE]. You are in a different position, and it is from the [UNCLEAR] because they want you the same person. You cannot be. You are different. It was only that you could do something for the time being. That's all. But now, they know that you have curative powers, you can cure [UNCLEAR]. So, you [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: So you need not try to worry about this. Become that [UNCLEAR]. No, no they are Chiranjeevas and great personalities.  So you just [UNCLEAR] and you are not to be guided by them, now. [UNCLEAR]. So first have confidence in yourself. (Shri Mataji is asking persons from the audience.) Are you better [UNCLEAR]? Now, Simon how are you? Are you feeling guilty about something?

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji.)

Shri Mataji: Only [sheep go?] from one-way to another, all right? Just try to keep in the center. [UNCLEAR] and you have read a lot and you know a lot, just call him Nyara [UNCLEAR]. Means your knowledge is not enlightened.  One is to know and the other is to know that the knowledge which is enlightened. [UNCLEAR]. All right.

Shri Mataji: They were asking what is Samadhi?  I told you. It is enlightened awareness. Enlightened awareness. You are aware [UNCLEAR]. Samadhi is [UNCLEAR] In Sahaja Yoga first is Nirvichara Samadhi that is thoughtless enlightened awareness and second is Nirvikalpa Samadhi where is doubtless enlightened awareness. So, to go to that, doubtless condition, [UNCLEAR]  you have to change your style. You see, other thing you might have achieved [UNCLEAR] but Sahaja Yoga you achieve to be strong.

(Person from the audience speaking with Shri Mataji.)

Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] Tell your mind I am not going to fall.  [UNCLEAR]. There is nothing wrong with faith, not the blind faith, please. You have got the vibrations now, now believe in Me. That's the only way. There's no other way out [INAUDIBLE]. So, you have to be loving, never [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] all the time and the time [WILL or MAY] come when My attention is [UNCLEAR]. But blind faith not.  Because you feel the vibrations for yourself.  Either we absolutely have blind faith or [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: The people who are absolutely blind are useless. They like to say, because if they can ask questions to Me that I am [UNCLEAR] if they come to that point.  But those who are rational they can never come [in?]. Because it is like a jumpy, a jumping like a monkey from one branch to another and can never [UNCLEAR]. It's only if you feel Shraddha, surrendering you are going to achieve that state.  And then small ripples here and there.  Nothing [UNCLEAR] You are going to enjoy next state. [UNCLEAR] you know, time is short. You get your Realization and you take so much time after that [UNCLEAR] and that time is finished. [Why?]. Now you have seen [today?] you have Shraddha [UNCLEAR].

So that is very important, that by doubting you are not going to achieve anything. [UNCLEAR] you have to be [UNCLEAR].

(Shri Mataji is talking to the children). Big girls have gone out.  The big girls have gone out to play, you also go and play. All right?

[UNCLEAR]. They are innocent. They have faith in themselves. So stop your rationality. It is not going to take you any way.  You have to learn to develop your Shraddha. Even you get Realization, you cure people, you do anything. You have an example of somebody in [UNCLEAR]. His mother was cured just like that he was cured just like that. He got a job like that. He got it whatever he wanted. And then suddenly he drops out, without any Shraddha.  So, that's what.  How will you help ?  Because if you do not have Shraddha, you will be tired of jumping. All the time you are doubting [UNCLEAR] you like to do circles for a while. ItÂ´s all right, OK.  Now jump into it and get it. Now, what do you loose?

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: Ego. You loose your Ego [UNCLEAR]. What do you do? Nothing. You get all the powers [UNCLEAR]. But the time is too short and you are taking too long. I cannot even [UNCLEAR] [jumping like that all the time if you doubt?]. And what are you doubting? It's all [a play?]. You don't have to do anything about and doubting [UNCLEAR]. They doubt about every nonsensical thing, which has no meaning at all. They see things, which do not exist. Because it's just a - you see, a habit or you can say indulgence, you can say entertainment for people who doubt these things, and doubt those things. They are just jumping like monkeys. It's tough. Anyone of you who goes down into Shraddha and dissolves becomes a great instrument in the hands of God.  Even to say that I doubt it's wrong. These people think, "We are very honest that I doubt, I doubt!" Please, give up such honesty.  Absurd! Ego, which is making you say these things. That, "I doubt." Because by saying that it exists and it is that you are very honest. It's not your doubt [UNCLEAR].

When you realized that, that your Ego is doubting, it's not I, it's like Ego or maybe some possession in you. "Am I play into the hands of some possession or my own Ego?" That's what it is. Hundred percent. Because those who are not doubting have got their heart very simple. You see, [BRITISH NAME SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE - Mike?] never doubts. His own brother, he was helped so much in this, he had no money to eat his food. He had got bad condition because [UNCLEAR] When he came to Sahaja Yoga he couldn't [UNCLEAR]. His child was sick, he was cured; he was sick, he was cured; his wife was sick with something incurable, she was cured. But still he was doubting. He started taking drinks after that. He never used to take drinks. After doubting, he started taking drinks. He did all that was prohibited in Sahaja Yoga just to prove God. [UNCLEAR].

I would say pay attention and not to your doubts. Doubts are coming, from some dark corner of your mind. What are you going to loose is the point to look. Sort it out! Whatever this costs. Those who have doubted, have lost. Lost time. So don't please [do that ?] [UNCLEAR].  Every word I say to you is true and [UNCLEAR]. Every word.  So, don't doubt [UNCLEAR]. I know all these [UNCLEAR] now. I am not going to achieve anything by telling you. It's simple. Accept that [INAUDIBLE].

You are not thinking anything, you have to believe tell your mind to shut up. It is all ready running. [UNCLEAR] You want to get to that state, of complete doubtless awareness and for that are you going to let in doubts into your pockets? [UNCLEAR] they'll all be neutralized; you'll see people who were neutralized. And those who do it [INAUDIBLE].

[UNCLEAR] in your Shraddha, stay. It's important. It's like a kind of a habit. Stay. By your doubts, you are putting pressure and the way it has to face those doubts they are making you suffer. And you have to get it out. You are [UNCLEAR] forget it now. In many lives you have being seeking and now you are not going to play about anymore. All right?  Now, you are going to get [UNCLEAR] now absolutely. All right?

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: All right. All those [UNCLEAR] bring seven more to [Me in?] My house. [UNCLEAR]. More or likely.

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: Oh, any time from about 5. All right? Five, six, anytime. Come to My house and ask [UNCLEAR - NAME OF AS PERSON] to come and see Me also if possible because I talked to her about this.

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: All right? And as I love you try to love yourself. And now. [UNCLEAR]

One more thing I would like to say to you that this night today [UNCLEAR] our certain chakras how to clear them [UNCLEAR] physically in their paths. [UNCLEAR] Vishuddi chakra. Now, for Vishuddi chakra I've got many things but you can try one more thing which will help is to put your head on the ground near a bed [UNCLEAR] [and put your feet on the bed?]  and try to come up the bed more and more; more and more the body pushing on the bed, so remove  [UNCLEAR]  and then keep My photograph [UNCLEAR]. In that stage you [UNCLEAR] [you feel Vishuddi problem?].

In that case, in case you have - say left Vishuddi, then you turn your face towards the right [INAUDIBLE].  If you have the right Vishuddi then turn our face to the left. That's it. You have to make it [UNCLEAR], all of you have Vishuddi problem.

(Person from the audience speaking, "You mean, we lay on the floor?")

Shri Mataji: On the floor, lie down. See now, just like this is the light - it is that side towards you, towards the Vishuddi now. Go, go ahead. I mean, be careful. Ha. Now, go down, go down. And more, more. You see, if we try to break this lower portion on top [UNCLEAR].

(Persons from the audience speaking, "Brings the body strain [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: So that there is much of Hatha Yog.  [UNCLEAR]

(Person from the audience speaking, "[UNCLEAR] [You rest on your shoulder. Pressure more on the head. On Vishuddi.?].")

Shri Mataji: Shoulder. More on the head. Vishuddi. Better now?

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: No, no, you have the photograph whichever your side you do, you see?

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: You turn your photograph with you. See, you must look at the photograph, cause that's your Agnya, always. See, if Agnya is kept clear, then Vishuddi clears out better. That's why. See, that's why you have to move the photograph. Because your Agnya can be cleared out. Otherwise, the Agnya is blocked, you see? Better?

(Person from the audience speaking, "Hmm, it's very [UNCLEAR].")

Shri Mataji: ItÂ´s very good. All of you should try. I have told you about the Swadistana. [UNCLEAR].  What is to be done for Swadistana?

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: Now, for people who have a problem of Mooladhara or say, you cannot sit on the ground, that sort of things, for them, you should practice, would help your [left side this?] [UNCLEAR] See? You cannot stretch too much. Try to stretch it down. Down to the ground. [UNCLEAR]. Try. As much as you can. [UNCLEAR]  [Try, in one shot you cannot do it.?].

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, [UNCLEAR].

(Person from the audience speaking.)

Shri Mataji: try to raise it and push that down. Gradually you have to do it. You do it in a month.  That's very good... You lift this so only your Mooladhara is touching.

(Person from the audience speaking, "Is it possible, it's on the floor Mother?")

Shri Mataji: Put it further, try to do that. No, put this together. Just push that heels, spread the heels [UNCLEAR]. That helps you see? That helps. First you do this exercise. You see? It's working out. Much better. That is. It is working out. It is much better now. See, gradually it will work out. Gradually [if you do it?]. It's good for Mooladhara and all the people who have Mooladhara problem [UNCLEAR]. This would be a good idea.  So gradually, you should see [the change in?] different chakras [UNCLEAR].

Now for Hamsa also, Hamsa, lie on your body.  Like that. On your stomach

(Person asks, "Which chakra?")

Shri Mataji: For Hamsa.  Put your [UNCLEAR] and now ask the Mother Earth to suck in your problem. [UNCLEAR].
