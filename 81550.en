What do you call them? A blowtorch. I got blamed for this in a rather unfortunate way. What actually happened was I was with Mother, and Aurel was there too, and I walked in the door. My job at Brompton Square was always stripping the paint off. It was quite ironic, actually, because I was brought up rather racist, and after Brompton Square, I lived first in India and then in Africa, so that cured my racism good and proper. But it was strange because my job was always stripping the white paint off the doors and then painting them with dark brown varnish.

Anyway, I was pretty good at paint stripping, having done it for eight months, and I'd also done quite a lot before when I was younger as a hobby. I used to buy furniture, strip it, and sell it. That was in my teens. I knew that the one thing you never did was let an oxyacetylene torch just sit. You never, ever left it on because it's extremely dangerous. As I said, I get blamed when Mother says, "Linda left the torch on." And of course, as Mother says, what she says becomes the truth.

But in fact, as far as I remember, I remember walking in that room and the whole floor was covered in chalk dust because John Ewan, I think, was making those cornices in that room. The whole floor was covered in it. And I saw that some idiot—the understatement of the century—had left this oxyacetylene torch on, pointing into the middle of the room. It's something I literally would never have done in a million years. Plus, I wasn't even stripping in that room anyway; I was stripping in another room.

Mother was there. I've actually put this story in the book, and I happened to get a photograph of the sari she was wearing. Mother doesn't usually wear synthetic saris, but that day she was, which made it even more of a miracle. Mother walked in the room and appeared not to see the torch. The blue flame jumped out of the torch and went towards her. The flame went right around the sari in a ring of fire and then went back. By this time, I was lying on the floor because I just thought, "My God, she's going to go up in smoke because it's a nylon sari."

So I just jumped. I landed on my tummy because I thought, "Well, I don't care if I break my wrist or whatever. She's going to burn." I just grabbed the torch to turn it the other way, and I think that's probably why Mother thought it was me who had the torch—because I just dived onto the floor. I remember the whole front of my tummy was just full of chalk dust. And I remember her saying, "The fire cannot burn me. I am the fire." Alison Ravina, I remember talking to her about this story, said she remembers Mother saying, "The fire is just doing arti to me." It was just extraordinary because that was a nylon sari, and you remember that sort of blue flame? It went right around the sari. It was the most extraordinary thing. But as I said, I go down in history as being the one who left the torch lying around.

Interesting. One of my first times going to the airport to see Mother, before I was married and close to her, we were holding bits of her luggage. Mother suddenly turned to me and said, "What were you doing going to my house and doing namaskar on the pavement?" Mother had just recently given a talk about not saying "but Mother." So Carol thought to herself, "Don't say 'but Mother'." And also, Carol was thinking, "But Mother, you are God, you're divine, you know everything, you know I didn't do this." I just said to Mother, "I don't know, Mother." I couldn't think of anything else to say which wouldn't start with "but Mother." So I just stood there, and Mother just turned away and talked to somebody else.

Years later I went to see Mother and she said, "Yes, your wife is very sensible, such a decent, good lady. You should listen to her a lot more. Except, I can't understand why she did that, going to do namaskar there on the floor at that house where I used to live many years ago. That is so unlike her."

"But Mother, it wasn't her. It was someone else."

"What? And you didn't tell me? All these years, I've been very confused because this doesn't go with her personality. You should have told me."

"Well, we thought, Mother, that because of who you are, you know everything."

"Well, you have to tell me," Mother said. "These things you have to tell me. It is confusing for the brain, yes." But there you are. Mother has a memory, she knows our character and personality as well.
