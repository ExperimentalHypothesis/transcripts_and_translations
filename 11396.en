Sahaja Yoga : A Breakthrough In Our Evolutionary Process, Budapest [ Hungary] 1994 – 09 – 06 Public Program, Budapest,65’

At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot describe it and we cannot change it. Unfortunately, at this human awareness, you cannot know the truth. There is still a breakthrough, that has to take place in our evolutionary process. Whatever I am going to tell you...you don’t have to believe me. Blind faith has created all the problems. But please keep your mind open as scientist and if it is true then you have to accept it as honest people. Because it is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your country and the benevolence of the whole world. So the first thing we have to know that, we are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this intellect, ego or the conditionings. But we are the pure spirit, and we have to be reborn to be that. We have in ourselves the whole mechanism already placed and through this mechanism passes this power of kundalini. This power is placed in the Sacrum bone, that means the Greeks knew it’s a scared bone. Most of the world problems come from human beings, and all the human problems come from their centres. When these centres are in problem, we get all kinds of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems. But when this power rises, she enlightens all the centres, nourishes them and integrates them. It is a living process of evolution. You cannot achieve it by reading books, you cannot achieve it by chanting some mantras. You cannot achieve it by thinking about it. On the contrary if you read too much about it, about spirituality you get conditioned. Your mind can only move to the left or right. Thus some people become absolutely mad thinking that they know the truth. They become fundamentalists and they think they have a right to say that they are the people who are chosen ones. And those who get mesmerised go to the left. This happens to the seekers which is a very sorry thing. In these modern times there are many seekers who are born to seek the truth. But they are misled by many wrong people type of people who want to make money, actually it is a living process for which you cannot pay. But we don’t understand that how can we achieve our evolution without paying for it. I say it is a living process. How much did you pay to this Mother earth for creating these beautiful flowers. If you ask a doctor who runs our heart, he will say it is autonomous nervous system, but who is this auto? Science also has its limitations, one of the greatest limitation is that it cannot answer why are you here?  What is the purpose of life? There are many questions which can be answered once you get your enlightenment. Enlightenment is that, there is an all pervading power of Divine love, and that does all the living work. We have never felt the existence of that power. But enlightenment means that this kundalini has to be connected with that all pervading power. The kundal means the coil,because it is coiled up it is called kundalini. It is the reflection of the primordial mother. We have the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. If you have a Father and Son there has to be a Mother. But unfortunately Paul,who entered into Christian area tried not to bring in any feminine power. Perhaps he hated women. So in the west, I find the women have to all the time go on acting in a way that they should always feel attractive and they should keep the men very much pleased. But women are the power. They are potential power and men are the kinetic power. So there is a mutual living together that works out in families. If the families are not all right, the society won’t be all right. And if the society is not all right, the children won’t be all right. So it is very important to understand that there was God al mighty and also there was Primordial Mother, the Divine feminine power. Another thing we have to understand that people like Christ, who were of very highly evolved nature did not understand human beings. Christ has said that if one eye is doing the sign, you take it out. If one hand committing a sign, you cut it out. So half of the people, I think or most of the people would have been with one eye or with one hand. Christ thought that human beings, the Christians are all enlightened people. I think then Mohammad sahab must have thought that Christ has said so much about men then why not say about women also. So he put all kinds of restrictions on women. They never understood human beings at their own level. Both were divine, they could not understand what sort of human beings they are dealing with. So we have to understand that to be that, to be that pure, to be that righteous, something has to happen to us. You may be Christians,Hindu,Muslims anything, any brand, you can commit any signs.

But once we are enlightened you become automatically righteous. Once you are enlightened you become innocent. You don’t have to take out an eye or cut the hand. You become what Christ has expected, people have to be. The trouble is all the religions became power oriented or money oriented, never sprit oriented. So we find that religion has failed human beings, actually the human beings have failed the religions. All the religions were born on the same tree of spirituality. Like flowers on the same tree, but they plucked the flowers and now fighting with the dead flowers. This has been realized by many people, we had Mahatama Gandhi and he realized the same,that once we get Independence in India, we should really propagate this. Actually what happens that once we become one with the Divine power everbody knows the absolute truth. You know the absolute truth on your fingertips. Because this vibrations start coming from your hands and you can feel this all-pervading power. If you want to know, Is there God? You just put ypur hands and ask a question and Immediately you will start getting a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost!

That means there is God! Talking about God has been quite a lot. But now the time has come to prove the existence of God. Now with the enlightenment, when you get to the state where you know the absolute truth, how are you going to fight with each other. There can be no discussion, no argument, such brotherhood of understanding. You transcend all these limitations of race, of religion, of countries and you all become universal being. That’s your nature, because sprit is the universal being. You can feel your own centres because you get self-knowledge, and you can feel the centres of others. Mohhamad Sahab has said, at the time of Kyama, i.e. resurrection, your hand will speak. Also that your hand will give witness against you, means they will tell you what is wrong with you. So, this enlightenment is not just mental but it is felt on the central nervous system. Also you can know about the centres of others. So who is the other? You can feel everybody’s centres so you become collectively conscious. Now if you know how to correct your centres and also the centres of others, you can help yourself and help others also. Your life gets transformed completely. You become a peaceful, joyous person. You become like a witness and watch everything without getting disturbed. You get out of your problems and you can watch them by that you can solve them also. You will be happy to know that in India there are 3 doctors who have got MD in Sahaja yoga for curing incurable diseases. But if you become Sahaj yogis, you never get into any trouble, whether physical, mental or emotional trouble. And also spiritual problems which are caused by going to false gurus and to false lines also get corrected. Actually your attention becomes very innocent and enlightened. Wherever you put your attention, it acts, works. It gives you all the information. Also you become extremely powerful within yourself and extremely compassionate. All destructive habits you give up in no time. People have given up drugs overnight. You can see yourself what’s wrong for you. Supposing I hold a snake in my hand and there is darkness and I am obstinate and anybody tells me, there is a snake, I’ll say no, it’s a rope because I am obstinate. But as soon as there is some light, immediately I throw away the snake. That’s what happens, you become your own guide, you become your own guru. And you get all the knowledge which is absolute. The greatest thing that happens to you is that you jump into the ocean of joy. Joy is a singular experience. It is not like happiness and unhappiness. When your ego is pampered, you feel happy and when it is punctured, you feel unhappy. But joy is such a experience that you just watch everything without being attached to it. You don’t have to give up anything. We respect families very much. And you become very good family people. There are many enlightened souls who want to be born, and once you are enlightened, their children, who are born realized. And marriages also are very successful, most of them, may be one percent sometime they fail. On the whole you become extremely wise. We don’t have to tell you, about how to behave, how to have children or not to have children, you understand everything. That’s a new race already been created all over the world. There are 65 nations, who are following sahaja yoga. On the  eastern side, surprisingly Russia has thousands and thousands of sahaja yogis. I find Russians are not materialistic like Americans. Of course 30 percent are not up to a level, very superficial. But the rest of them are very beautiful and are very introspective. They have thrown away all the false Gurus from Russia. They told them we have no money for you so better get out. This is the treasure of spirituality which you have. You are Divine within yourself. You are glorious and you are beautiful. You are glorious and you are beautiful. You  don’t know yourselves, that’s the problem. You are lost in the wilderness of ignorance, I should say. But if you find yourself then you will be amazed, how great you are! You enter into the kingdom of God. And the life become a bliss. Every time, people get realization, they write to me very beautiful letters as to how they have got blessings and miracles. I told one gentleman, you compile them, within one month he said, they have gone up to my head, what am I to do? So, he said, Mother, you better see to it. I said, I have no time. Actually I travel every day, today I came, tomorrow I am going, so where is the time? I am 71 years of age and still I am working like this. So, this happens to you also. So, this is the power of Divine love. People have never known this. They only know hatred. People talk of peace; they have no peace. There are organizations of peace and people have got awards for peace, but they are so hot tempered. If you have to talk to them then you must keep a barge poll in between. Barge poll is to push the force, you know. I don’t know how they get awards for peace. All this can happen to you all. Now I have to tell you that it’s very easy to get this realization. Sahaj, saha means with you, ja is born with you, is the right to get this union with the Divine power. It is absolutely spontaneous. It will take hardly ten minutes, to work out the process of Kundalini awakening. But you have to know one thing that Kundalini is the power of a pure desire. Whether, you are aware of it, or not but you have only one pure desire is to become one with the Divine power. Other desires are not satiable in general. For  today you want to have a house, then a car, a helicopter, I don’t know  goes on like that. Whatever you desire, never satisfies with it. If you have pure desire to get your realization, it will work out in no time. Of course, you have to be humble, it’s not meant for arrogant people. Of course, not meant also for idiots and stupid people. So, now about ten minutes, I said you will take. Now those who don’t want to have, should leave the hall, I cannot force on you. Because, I respect your freedom. If you want to have, you will have. You have to be comfortably sitting, not to bend too much, not to go back too much, straight. You don’t have to strain yourself in any way. Don’t have to go to Himalayas, to stand on your head. There are three conditions, which are very simple. First condition is that, you have to forgive everyone, without thinking about them. Many people say that it’s very difficult to forgive. But logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. So, when you don’t forgive, you play into wrong hands. It’s a myth, but you torture yourself. The worst thing is that the centre at the Optic chiasma is like this, constricted. And if you don’t forgive, then this centre, won’t open like this. And at this important moment, you will miss your self-realization. So it is very important that we have to forgive everyone and not to think about them, because that is also a headache. The second condition is that; you have to forgive yourself. That means you should not feel guilty at all. That is another weight.  If do some mistakes, you must commit them at that time, what’s the use of carrying on this weight of guilt. As a result of that your centre on the left hand side catches very badly. You get diseases like Spondylitis, like angina, like lethargic [unclear] So, why to get these diseases, for feeling guilty. In short you should be pleasantly face towards your selves. There is no confession in sahaja yoga, no not at all. Your Kundalini knows everything about you. I think they can’t understand [ unclear text] She is your mother, your individual mother your own mother. And she is anxious to give you the second birth. Why will she give you any trouble. When you were born your mother took all the trouble herself. So in short you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. After all you are human beings and you can commit mistakes, you are not Gods. So I hope you will forgive yourself at this moment. The third condition is that you have to take out your shoes. Because this Mother earth helps quiet a lot. In England when I said you have to take out your shoes, half of them walked out. You have to know that we have two powers left and right. And the left power is for the action of desire. And the right one is for the action itself. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right. But otherwise you should put your  both the feet apart from each other. You have to put your left hand towards me like this. Because the left hand is symbolically suggesting that you desire to have your realization. Now, we have to use our right hand for nourishing our centres on the left hand side. First we’ll show you how to do it. Put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit. If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So now, take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side which is the centre of your mastery. This centre has been created by the great prophets in the past. Now please take your right hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of pure Divine Knowledge. Now raise your left hand upper portion of your abdomen. Then raise it on your heart. Now raise this centre on the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here, where you don’t have to feel guilty. Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across. Here it is bend your head and this centre is about forgiving others without thinking about them. Please take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. At this centre, without feeling guilty, without  counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask  for forgiveness from the Divine power. Now stretch your palm fully please put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Push back your fingers and please put down your head. Now here  put pressure on your head and move it seven times clock wise, slowly.

That’s how you have to be, now you have to close your eyes, before that you will have to keep both your feet apart from each other. Put the left hand towards me and put the right hand on your heart. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself. You may call me ‘Mother’ or ‘ Shri Mataji’. Please ask in your heart three times, Mother, “ am I the Spirit”. I have already told you,that if you become the spirit, you become your own master. So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Here you ask me another fundamental question about yourself three times in your heart. Here you ask, “ Mother am I my own master ?” I have told you, that I respect your freedom and cannot force pure Divine Knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So please put your right hand the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals.  So please ask,“ Mother give me pure Divine Knowledge, please”; as soon as you ask for pure Divine knowledge, your kundalini starts getting awakened. So we have to nourish our upper centres with our self confidence, to make the Kundalini pass through. Now please put your right hand the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you ask ten times, “Mother, am I my own Master? “ask with self-confidence. Please don’t open your eyes till I tell you. Now raise your right hand on your upper portion of your abdomen and ask really ten times   [unclear] “ Mother, am I, “ Mother I am my own Guru” I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions, this ego, these conditionings but you are the pure spirit. Now please raise your right on your heart, and here say with full self-confidence, say twelve times, “Mother, I am the pure spirit.” This all-pervading Divine power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever mistakes you have committed, are absolutely dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and raise your right on the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your neck on the right-hand side. Here you have to say again, with full self-confidence, sixteen times “Mother, I am not guilty at all”. Now, I have told you, that if you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and make yourself miserable. Especially at this moment it is important, very important to forgive without thinking about them. Because this centre of agnya is very constricted, will never open and will never allow Kundalini to rise. So now raise your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times with full self-confidence, “Mother I forgive everyone” in general. Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from all this pervading Divine power. So now please take your right on the back of your head and push back your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, “ O, Divine power, if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me” Last centre is very important because the Kundalini pierces through it and joins this subtle power of Divine love. So now you stretch your palm fully and put your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area. Now stretch back your fingers as far as possible and move your scalp seven times slowly, here again I cannot force self-realization on you, so when you are moving your scalp seven times please say, “ Mother, give my self-realization” Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes, now put both the hands, please open your eyes, put both the hands towards me, little higher and watch me without thinking. Now put the right hand towards me like this, put down your head and see from your left hand that if there is cool or hot breeze like vibrations coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Please don’t doubt yourself. Now please put the left hand towards me like this and see with the right hand if there is cool or hot breeze is coming out of your fontanelle bone area. If it is hot then know that you have not forgiven, so please forgive. Again with the right hand. Put your right hands towards me and put your left hand on top of your fontanelle bone area and see if there is cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area.
