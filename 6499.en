I bow to all the seekers of truth.
At the very outset we have to realize that truth is what it is. We cannot think about it, we cannot conceptualize it, we cannot imagine it. And at this human awareness, this state, we cannot know it. We have to become a subtler being; we have to be the Spirit. So it is important to understand what is the truth. Here I am telling you about something which you should listen to with an open mind of a scientist. And if is true and it works out, then as honest people you have to accept it. You should not accept anything blindfolded.

So the first truth is that you have to be the Spirit. Actually you are the Spirit. You have to become the Spirit. And the second truth is that there is All Pervading Power of Divine Love, which does all the living work. We see beautiful flowers and we take them for granted. It's a miracle. (Little louder. People can't hear it. Little louder.) It's a miracle. What about our eyes which is a miracle, it's a wonderful camera? What about our brain which is a miracle, it's a computer. (Tell her not to take my photographs while I'm speaking!). But we take everything for granted. Who runs our heart? We say it is autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto? We all have got this divinity absolutely intact within ourselves. It is in a potential state and it is indestructible. Cannot be destroyed. Whatever you might have done, what your mistakes so called you must have committed your Divinity is absolutely intact.

In the beginning we are aware of it also sometimes. We believe that there is something higher, a force, which is looking after us. But this faith gets challenged. This faith gets challenged. The first challenge may be coming when we discover that the religions, which are talking of higher life are only money oriented or power oriented. We all want to believe in something. Now you have been in a communist regime. At least there is one nice thing has happened that you did not take to fundamentalism. But as soon as you give up your faith in one thing, you'll jump on to another and maybe you might take to fundamentalism. Is a very dangerous thing. All the fundamentalists believe that there cannot be a universal religion. They have to have different religions; they have to have. And as long as there will be different religions, there will be wars, there will be fightings and no end to our struggles.

We have to now understand that there is innate religion within us, which is a universal one, because the Spirit is the universal being within ourselves. As it is universally whatever country we may belong to, whatever race we may belong to, we all laugh the same way, smile the same way, cry the same way. Our whole body is made inside the skin the same way. Also all of us have got... (You don't have a chart here, didn't have a chart. All right. Is this one? There is one. All right.) All of us have these centers within us universally the same thing. All of us, all of us have the same power Kundalini within us. There is no difference in the construction of this universal mechanism within us.

But when you become the Spirit, then you realize that all the religions are born out of one tree of spirituality. They were born at different times, were created by great Incarnations and prophets. These religions have the same principle behind it that we all have to become the Spirit. Otherwise we do not get into our ascent. The second challenge comes to us from science. But the science is not conclusive. Up to a point is all right, but when we go to extremes it boomerangs on us. It cannot give us our ascent, it cannot give us truth, it cannot give us reality. Please listen to what I'm saying. That is much more important than photographs.

And the third one is a challenge from intellectuals, like Freud. Now they have discovered that Freud was a fraud. Freud was a fraud. And that it has created such a malignant effect on the culture and thought of the Western people. By his stupid ideas he has given us AIDS and so many other diseases, which are secret. Actually he has created a very complex personality, devoid of any wisdom. But people worshipped him more than they worshipped Christ. This might be because of the Catholic Church, which talked of the original sin. So people from that austerity jumped into another mess of Mr. Freud. William Blake*, a great poet in London has said that this idea of original sin has come from some Satan. And they discussed and discussed about the sin of Mother Mary. And also then we find a kind of a reaction to it. That means all other prophets, all other incarnations were sinners.

Once when you get your Self Knowledge, you will know that none of you are sinners. The eternal quality of spirituality is quite intact within you. All these dogmas and all these theories are, I think for frightening people, and also for making money out of them. Our ascent is a natural process of evolution for which you cannot pay. You cannot put in an effort. As a seed sprouts by itself you get your ascent, absolutely spontaneously. You don't have to stand on your head, or you don't have to starve and fast and go to Himalayas.

And tonight we are going to, all of us, going to receive Self Realization. As a result of this happening the Kundalini, which passes through these six centers, nourishes them. All the world problems are because of human beings. And all the human problems are because their centers are not all right. If these centers could be put right, all problems can be solved. But with this happening you achieve a state by which you become powerful yourself and you can give Realizations to others. As one enlightened light can enlighten many, once you get your enlightenment, you can enlighten many.

This is the age of Blossoming Times. This is the age that we call it as the Last Judgment. You will have to judge between the truth and untruth. You'll have to find out who are the false people and who are the real people. Even in Koran it is said that at the time of Resurrection, Kiyama, your hands will speak. Is exactly what happens to you, that you can feel your own centers and the centers of others.

Now, if you know how to correct these centers, you solve the problems. This Kundalini is like this connection, which is connected to the mains. Unless and until you are connected to this All Pervading Power we have no meaning, no identity to ourselves. You may call yourself by any name, but it is all artificial, for you may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim. You can commit any sin, you can do any wrong. So, all these stamps that we are carrying has no meaning at all inside.

Something has to work out inside. And this is what is what we call as Self Knowledge. But once you get Self Knowledge, you also get the knowledge about others. So, you develop a new dimension in your awareness called as collective consciousness. Also when Kundalini rises, you become thoughtlessly aware. The thoughts are coming from the past or the future and we are jumping on the cusp of the thought. There is a little space in between these thoughts, which is the present. And when the Kundalini rises, you stand in the present. At that time you become absolutely thoughtless. But you are absolutely aware. And then inspiration start coming to you.

As you know very well and I also admire the art and the aesthetics of Czechoslovakian people. This beautiful creation of this say hall or anything in your country is coming from some, definitely from some realized souls. After Realization you'll be surprised how creative you become, in every field of art. You become a very peaceful personality. You become extremely dynamic but at the same time you are extremely compassionate. In the light of the Spirit you become your own master. These are all your own qualities, which start manifesting.

This is not a sermon or a lecture, but it is the actualization of the spirithood, is the experience of the All Pervading Power you get as cool breeze on your hands. Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Bible they are ambiguous about Holy Ghost. They have the Father and the Son, but no Mother. And the Mother is the Holy Ghost. She is the Primordial Mother. In the Greek mythology they call Her Athena; in India they call Her Adi Shakti. Even Mohamed Saab has said that there is paradise at the Lotus Feet of the Mother. In the Gospel of Thomas, He tells about Christ who said, "This is my Mother who bore me, but I have another Mother with the M capital who is the Mother of the whole world". So now this Primordial Mother is reflected in you as the Kundalini in the sacrum bone. And God Almighty is reflected in your heart as the Spirit. You may not believe in God, but once you feel the experience of the truth, then you can easily find out if there is God or not.

So now we will have the experience. (Loudly, they can't hear. That's why so many are going out). It will take hardly ten to fifteen minutes. You can't pay for it, you can't think about it. It's a spontaneous happening, without any trouble to you. First you will feel thoughtlessly aware and then you will feel this All Pervading Power for the first time. You'll also feel the Kundalini coming out of your fontanel bone area. You can feel It, as cool breeze. Is very simple. I know some people have some questions in their mind. I would say there are so many of My lectures about it, because it's the ocean of knowledge. In this short time I cannot explain to you everything. But first, best is to get your Enlightenment and then you can think about It. Before we start I must tell you that it cannot be forced on anyone. I respect your freedom.

Only those who really want Self Realization should be in the hall, otherwise they should leave the hall. No doubt all of you can get Realization, but as Christ has said that humble in heart will inherit the Earth. So, we have to be humble about it. If you are arrogant, the Kundalini won't rise. You have to ask for it, because Kundalini is the power of pure desire. So, you should have pure desire to ascent. There are three conditions before we started. The first one is that you all have to be absolutely self-confident that you all are going to get your Self Realization tonight. But you have to be little attentive. The second condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all. If you have committed mistakes, it's all right. After all you are human beings, you are not Gods. If you have committed mistakes, then just face them and don't put them as guilt in you. Because if you feel guilty, this center on the left side gets absolutely into trouble and then you can get diseases like angina, or spondylitis, or lethargic organs. So, why feel guilty? Forget the past! In short you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself, if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God. Forgive yourself.

Now, the third condition is to forgive everyone in general. Many people say it is difficult to forgive. But logically, whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do? You do not do anything. On the contrary when you don't forgive, you play into wrong hands. Those who have tortured you, those who have troubled you are nicely enjoying themselves. And you are torturing yourself on their behalf. Also the center on the optic chiasm is like this, very constricted. If you do not forgive, it won't open. And the Kundalini won't get through and you'll miss your Self Realization. As it is you're torture yourself all your life, and now are you going to miss your Self Realization? So if you forgive, it opens like this.

These are the three simple conditions which if you fulfill I'm sure you all will get your Realization tonight. All of you should be sited, would be better not to stand, but please be sited. You all have to be comfortable. You shouldn't bend, nor you should stretch yourself too much, but sit comfortably. Those who want to go and don't want to do should leave the hall, now, and should not disturb later on. Now we'll show you first how you are going to nourish your own centers. As it is there are two powers, one is on the left, one on the right. So, will you please put both your feet away from each other? But before that, please take out your shoes because this Mother Earth is going to suck our problems. Please put both the feet apart from each other. Is very simple. All right.

Please put your left hand towards Me, like this. This is symbolically suggesting that you want to have your Self Realization because left side is the power of desire. And the power of pure desire is Kundalini. Now, right side is the power of action. So we'll put our left hand on our lap comfortably and with the right hand we'll nourish our centers. So, now please put your right hand on your heart. Left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart. You don't have to do this again. In the heart resides the Spirit as I told you. So if you become the Spirit, you also become your master, your guide. So, you take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. We work on the left hand side.

This is the center of your mastery. Then you take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the center of pure knowledge, Pure Divine Knowledge. Now, you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Again on your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and put your head to your right. I've already told you that when you feel guilty this center goes into trouble. Now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head. This is the center for forgiving everyone in general.

Now, please take your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the center for asking forgiveness from the Divine Power, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction. Now the last center: stretch your palm fully. Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now press back your fingers. Please put down your head as far as possible. Stretch back your fingers because there should be a sufficient pressure on your scalp. Now, please move your scalp seven times clock-wise slowly. Press back your fingers otherwise there won't be any pressure. That's all we have to do.

Now we start again and we close our eyes. Please close your eyes. Here you ask Me a fundamental question about you, three times. You may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji. Now ask a question in your heart three times: "Mother, am I the Spirit?" I've already told you that if you are the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So, now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side; press it hard. Here you have to ask another fundamental question, three times: "Mother, am I my own master?" I've told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force the Pure Divine Knowledge on you. You have to ask for It. So, now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here, now ask six times, because this center has got six petals: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge", six times. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising.

So now we have to nourish our upper centers with our self-confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here with full confidence you have to say ten times: "Mother, I am my own master." (Loudly) I've told you that the fundamental truth about you is that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So, now please raise your right hand on your heart and with full confidence say twelve times: "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." This Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge, compassion and bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by the Power of this ocean of forgiveness.

So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right and say it sixteen times with full confidence: "Mother, I am not guilty at all." I've already told you whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. You do not have to think about these people, but raise now your hand on top of your forehead and bend your forehead. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Now please take your right hand the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction: "Oh, Divine Power please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly". Say it from your heart, not how many times. Now, the last center, please stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now push back your fingers as far as possible. Now please bend your head. You have to, now, know that I respect your freedom and I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now please bend your head and push back your fingers and move your scalp slowly seven times saying: "Mother, please give me my Self Realization."

Now please take down your hands. Put both the hands towards Me, like this. Watch Me without thinking. You can do it. Now put the right hand towards Me like this and put your head down and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze like waves coming out of your fontanel bone area. Don't put your hand on the head, away from it. Some people get it far away. Do not doubt it. It's coming from your head. Now please put your left hand towards Me and again put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area by the right hand. If it is hot that means you have not forgiven. So, please forgive everyone. Now, take your right hand and put down your head. Please put down your head. Like this right hand and put down your head again and see with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like wave coming out of your own fontanel bone area.

Now raise both your hands towards the sky, like this and push back your head. Here you ask a question three times, anyone of these. Ask a question three times: "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Or you can ask three times: "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?" Or you can ask a question three times:" Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Now please take down your hands. Put your hands towards Me like this and don't think. It is beyond thinking. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips, or on their palm, or through the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. Everybody [does?] do it please.

I bow to you all. Your saintly life has started. Very few people did not get it, but all of them can have it. There is never a doubt about it. You must know that this is a collective happening and only you cannot do it individually, that you become part and parcel of the whole. And you must know your brothers and sisters in fifty-five nations. Please, within one-month time I'm sure you'll be all masters for which you don't have to pay, but you have to give some attention and little time. I hope you'll respect your Self Realization and grow into it. All such Sahaja Yogis who have achieved a certain depth are invited to come to Cabella where I live, in Italy, to celebrate "The Festival of Lights." You don't have to pay for your stay there. So you can meet so many people from other countries. It will be only for three days.

Thank you very much.

This gentleman with the camera didn't get it so you can give him Realization. So thank you very much. I'll come next year again to Prague.
