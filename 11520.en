Avahana on the occasion of the marriage of Catherine and Gregoire, Rahuri, India,  (from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 1, page 1)

In Sahaja Yoga, all the religions are respected because all the incarnations and previous prophets are in us. We know it for definite that they exist within us on our Centres. First, before starting the marriage, we had to ask them to come and be present on this function. This is called "avahana" [invitation; invocation].

Now, they were all there. So, we are now to thank them that you have been here and the marriage has been successful.

In Sahahaj Yoga, we are going to break all the barriers which make religions and people separate. All fanatical nonsense, old ideas which have propped up to make money out of religion, all these we are going to completely abolish and make one religion for all the humanity, which is religion of God, the religion of our evolution.

May God bless you all.
