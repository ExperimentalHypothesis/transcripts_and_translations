Welcome Speech. Vienna (Austria), 7 June 1988.

These flowers should be put in the water, I think. And I have also brought some flowers, they have sent you all flowers from there and best wishes to all of you. All the English Sahaja Yogis came to the airport and send their best wishes to you all.

And there have been miracles and miracles. One of them was, there is, you know Harry Jairam, he's a very ordinary student and he was doing something, I think with electromagnetic work he was doing, and suddenly he discovered a kind of a switch which he does not know how it has come to him, and he doesn't know how it works. So he has been given a very big job and now he has to lecture to people and tell them how it works but he doesn't know how it works. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

I won't have anything, I think, I had mine, all right little bit, little bit. What should I have? Whatever is German. This is German? No, Indian. All right. Thank you.

Sit down, sit down. There is room this side I think for some people.

We all have gathered here from so many countries. It's very heartening to see how Sahaja Yoga is now spreading smoothly into the countries who have different type of ideologies. Sahaja Yoga is a very pleasant beautiful blessing to all of us. You don't have to sacrifice anything, you don't have to become a martyr, you don't have to go to jail or suffer at all. Slowly and steadily it works, works correcting you, helping you, making you sensitive to enjoy the joy of the Spirit. But there must be something difficult in Sahaja Yoga because we do not get so many people as other false gurus have got it. And there is a drawback, one can say, that Sahaja Yoga cannot spread very fast. By its very nature it cannot spread, because it is a living process. One has to become a Sahaja Yogi. It is not easy because you cannot just change your dress and become a Sahaja Yogi, you cannot just put a sort of a brand and become a Sahaja Yogi or it is not that you just start combing your hair in a particular style that you become a Sahaja Yogi. (Shri Mataji laughing)

You do not have to, of course, pay any money, put in any effort, it works spontaneously, automatically. But I understand that it is difficult for human beings to accept anything that grows by itself. They want to have something which they can themselves achieve. Some people told Me, "Mother, at the first meeting never give Realization, and one by one chakra You open. (Shri Mataji laughing) And after 7 days or 7 months or 7 years You give Realization." (Shri Mataji laughing)

What to do? This is a jet-Kundalini in jet-age. (Laughter) It works so fast that it's impossible to control it. This is one of the drawbacks is that it works spontaneously, that's why people don't want to come to Sahaja Yoga. They want to pay for their guru, they want to pay for their Realization. In short, they want to purchase everything. They have asked Me, "What is the economic value of Sahaja Yoga?" So this is the situation in which we are and we shouldn't mind if it doesn't spread very fast.

The another very subtle point is there in Sahaja Yoga and which I think I'll ask you the question. So why Sahaja Yoga does not progress in you, what is an essential compulsory condition? Who can answer? They're all thoughtless, that's the problem. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) So now let's have it, what is the compulsion, that's important. Which was never for any incarnation nor for any prophet nor for any gurus or anyone.

Sahaja Yogi: It's the combination of the Brahma Shakti Herself and it has never been before that the Brahma Shakti Herself has incarnated.

Shri Mataji: That's it, but what is the compulsion?

Sahaja Yogi: It's the conditioning.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no what is the condition for you? There is one compulsion for you Sahaja Yogis.

Sahaja Yogi: That we have not our ideal behaviour.

Shri Mataji: No, no, not at all. There are many with ideal behaviours, yes.

Sahaja Yogi: We think too much, he says.

Shri Mataji: No, that's not, what I'm trying to say, that's not the point, I'm saying there is one little compulsion in Sahaja Yoga.

Sahaja Yogi: Dedication.

Shri Mataji: Yes, little closer, but still.

Sahaja Yogi: Obedience.

Shri Mataji: That's not. Obedience anybody can have for anyone.

Sahaja Yogi: Love and enjoyment.

Shri Mataji: Enjoyment is the result but what is the compulsion? What do you have to pay?

Sahaja Yogis: Devotion, love, dedication.

Shri Mataji: Love, love you have for everyone. What is so great? (Laughter) Still, still, little, little closer. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Sahaja Yogis: Recognition, open heart.

Shri Mataji: What is the compulsion, what is the fees you have to pay, let us see, what is the position you have to come to? What is the need? What is she saying?

Sahaja Yogi: We have to surrender, she says, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: No, that's all right, surrender, but still. (Laughter) You're there but not there inside.

Sahaja Yogini: Recognize You as Adi Shakti.

Shri Mataji: Correct. That's it. That's it, that's the important point. Unless and until you recognize Me spiritual progress is not possible. As you progress the recognition increases, it goes hand in hand, sort of thing. And this is the most difficult, very difficult problem of modern times, very difficult. Because we cannot recognize anyone unless and until he is elected or put in a position or branded. But from your heart to recognize you have to have a very sensitive spiritual attainment. It's not a mental recognition, it's an integrated recognition. Some may recognize Me from their hearts but will not recognize Me from their intelligence - so they'll be fighting. Or they do not accept Me physically that one has to do certain things physically. But this recognition itself is joy giving. Just you think, and if I have to think that, "I'm sitting before the Adi Shakti, I would be so very happy, and I'll bless my soul, that oh God, this is what has happened to me, what have I done so great?" So that recognition when it comes in it disciplines you in Sahaja Yoga, completely.

Like say, you know somebody is the, say, queen of England, mental recognition, then immediately you observe a kind of a protocol with her. But all disciplining in Sahaja Yoga comes from within, from the Spirit. So now it is, whether you can ask Me this way that, "Mother, is it the egg first or the hen?" A sort of a process it is. Whether the hen came first or the egg came first.

Yes, so in that way we can say: "Mother, is it that first our spiritual awakening should take place or should we recognize You?" So then the question is, that if I say that it is when the light, the candle goes up the light spreads. It's like simultaneous. So you may start at that time asking a question, "Then Mother, how to keep the light, how to increase the light?" Now can I ask you again, what should we do?

Sahaja Yogi: Meditation, meditation, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That's one thing. (Laughter) But people do it mechanically.

Sahaja Yogi: With the right desire.

Shri Mataji: No. But the best thing is, I think, the attitude, all the time in the beginning to witness everything, as if it's Mother who is doing it. And then you will see so many miracles happening. So mentally you will start understanding that there's something special about our Mother. Then also in the heart you have to put Me there in the heart all the time, so you will see your emotions, how beautiful emotions you'll have, such beautiful joyous ripples of different kinds of thrills, I can call it.

Like say, now you go in the sea - sea you go, you don't love the sea, do you, but the sea loves you. And the waves of sea, the waves of sea they give you thrills itself. So just to pray that, "Lead me deeper into this ocean of love." And then you will feel the ripples coming out of your heart like a fountain and just bathing you. And such joy is flowing that people will look at your faces, they said, "What's happening inside you? The way the eyes are glistening and the way that your faces are shining, we can't believe it, what's happening?" And you'll be just witnessing that joy within yourself and you'll enjoy it because there are no words to describe it. As they say at Sahasrara you get Nirananda, means "only joy", Kewal Ananda, absolute joy, there's nothing second to it.

In happiness and unhappiness are two sides of a coin, but joy has no another side. It's the ascending force which slowly, slowly takes you to that beautiful realm of enjoyment.

I felt very happy and really joyous to see you all there. And like the ocean, you see, that strikes all the shores and then all the ripples go back and weave a pattern, that's how the whole of My life I could see as a beautiful pattern. And that beautiful lacing you cannot describe in words.

So I would say now good night to you and enjoy in your dreams also the same joy.

May God bless you all!

I would like to know what's the program is like.
