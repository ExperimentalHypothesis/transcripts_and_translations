Today is the day for us to celebrate in India very much. Because the Sun is now in Capricorn and from Capricorn it then comes to Tropic of Cancer. When the Sun comes back to this Earth then all the creativity of mother earth starts acting and she creates such beautiful things like flowers, nice nourishing things and fulfilling things like fruits and she makes our eyes cool down with the greenery she has and the way she blesses us is manifold with the advent of the Sun.

In the same way now that the Sun of Sahaj Yoga is rising and is coming to the zenith and it has definitely shown you the result on the first principal that is your Mooladhara and your creative power of that Mooladhara which is the Kundalini has been rising and rising and opening your being, and showing the results in your life. It has made your lives very beautiful. It has made your life very joyous and very happy. Now we are at a point where we have to trigger a new jump, a new flight. And for this flight we have to see that we become very light in our Ideas, thoughts and in our Conditionings. You are so much full of conditionings. All types of Conditionings are on us. I don't understand how we get struck to things which are of no value, which are of no sense. And they get lost.....

In this higher jump, which you are going to take many will be left behind as a result, those who will not be able to come out of that. So at this stage I have to request you that you should realy fully dedicate yourself to meditation and surrender yourself to collectivity. Everyday, you must ask yourself, "what have I done for Sahaj Yoga?", " what have I done for myself?" Please try to understand that there is a very big Jump we have to undertake. It has to be triggered and for that I would like you to be ready. To be absolutely prepared because in this jump you might be lost, and many might be left because they could not get over their Conditionings. The conditionings are of various types of ignorance, blind faith, and all other things that we have gone through, also we have conditionings of our country, of our race, of our styles and so many other things by which we judge others.But we have to judge ourselves, that are we in Sahaj culture? Otherwise it’s going to be very difficult that you will board the ship which is going to take us off. I have just warned you that later on if you say that: “Mother so many were left behind”. If you find anybody left behind, please try to help that person. Please try to correct that person and with clear idea and clear voice and clear cut instruction. If you really find that somebody is going wrong, you better warn him. I am telling you all today that this is a vary crucial time and none of should just take for granted Sahaj Yoga.

All other things are just a kind of an illusion that you feel that your worldly things are all right and worldly things you can manage. God doesn’t care for those people who are rich and well off or people who are poor. What He sees is what richness you have got of spirituality. He doesn’t bother about your education, of your degrees, of pompousness etc. What He sees is how innocent you are. How much have you worked for Sahaja Yoga? What have you done for God’s work. So all these priorities you must change. I must tell you that Sahaj Yoga judges you on a very subtle point. So in this last judgement now as you people have been judged as good people. But still for the second jump that you are going to have, you have to be very careful that those of you who think you are Sahaj Yogis in you heart but are not nay be left behind in this big jump we are going to take.So it is important that Sun has risen and gone to the zenith and at the time of its zenith, one has to be very careful because the same Sun which has started making its beautiful greenery all around us may scorch with its heat. So be careful and one has to be aware and all the time under the guidance of sahaj yoga. What is wrong with us?, what is making us so heavy?, what is making us so difficult?. So far I am very happy that whatever I have been telling you and whatever I had been guiding you, you have accepted it very calmly and sweetly. And that you have tried to imbibe it in your lifestyle.Actually, after sometime, I don't think I'll have to tell you anything. You will get your own light to see for yourself what is right and what is wrong. But still I would say that you must open your heart in the pooja, in the music, in everything. Just you see that you open your heart. If you cannot open your heart, it wont work. Because it works through spirit which resides in our heart.All your Conditiongs, all your Ego will disappear when you decide that I have to open my heart for Sahaja Yoga.

May God bless you !!
