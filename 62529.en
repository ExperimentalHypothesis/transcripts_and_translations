This is the most important occasion for you all.

Of course, self-realisation was the first most important step. And now that you all want to marry, you must understand that it's a responsibility as Sahaja Yogini's. Much greater responsibilities than normal brides have. As I have already told you, that to make the marriages successful, you will have to be extremely sensible, mature. You shouldn't behave childishly in any way. Now the childhood is over and now you are becoming Gruha Lakshmi's. So you have to behave in a way a Gruha Lakshmi has to behave. I've also told you that you are like the Mother Earth, that you have to give as much love as you can, as the Mother Earth does, and that she has power to bear lots of things and to make the married life happy. It's important for you to say things which are congenial for your marriage. So try to forgive, try to be kind and sweet, because men have to work outside and they suffer a lot. When they come home, you are the one who has to pacify them, to look after them. Because it's not question of your married life, it's question of the collective living society of Sahaja Yoga.

In that society we have to be very sensible and mature. I think it's the brides who will make the family happy, who will look after them. Forgive all the shortcomings of your husband, they are men after all, and you have to be one of the mothers of your children. So it's a very enjoyable time. If you don't think about it and enjoy your husband, don't criticize them, don't try to sort of find out faults with them. As you are not perfect, they are also not perfect. But you should try to be complementary and take the life in a way that you are Sahaja Yogi's. I think the more responsibility is on wife. Actually, ninety-five percent responsibility is on the wives. And they have to look after the husbands, the family, the children, the in-laws, everyone. It is for them to make the life of your society happy. Social life is to be maintained by the housewives. So now anybody Sahaja Yogi's come to your house, you should be very happy to entertain them, to look after them, and not to show any kind of selfishness and self-centredness. And should know that you are part and parcel of one family, and you have to look after all the people who are your part and parcel.

You have to be very gentle and kind. There's no need to be harsh. And it for that sort of nonsense is not needed, because you are not the same as your husband is. You have much more powers to bear and to understand. You have to be matured people. That's the main thing, you must know that you have to be matured. In maturity you should see how things work out. It is you who has to manage, you are responsible for it. So once you understand your responsibility, I'm sure, you'll do very well. It's not the responsibility of the husband, but it's your responsibility to look after the social side of Sahaja Yoga. And as a part of that, your family, wherever you are, whether you are in the ashrams or you are outside, you have to be extremely kind to each other, forgiving and giving. And I should hear very good news about the brides of 1990. I hope so. You will not let me down. I have chosen all of you, I have chosen your husbands also, and I'm sure they have to say that such beautiful wives we have got. You are looking so beautiful in the same way. Make your family also very beautiful, your children beautiful, and the whole of our society should be very beautiful. So remember the responsibility of having a beautiful society depends on you. We should give up all the pettiness, all the jealousies, all the stupidities of our young age. Now we are entering into new era.

May God bless you all.
