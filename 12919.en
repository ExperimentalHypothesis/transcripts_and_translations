[Laughter]
Bring them to the airport and they must be thinking, "What to do with this and what to do with that?"
[Laughter]
Once, we went to the airport with my granddaughter, and very small, to the [unclear]. Pulling this side. I said, "What are you doing?" She said, "In this airport, everybody seems to be mad. I'm trying to tie them up properly". Going on like this, very fast, to tie them up.

I beg your pardon? What does she say?
Sahaja Yogi: She said she's got a ribbon.
Shri Mataji: Oh! I see. That's a good one. And you are wearing a very beautiful necklace also. That's a beautiful one. Yes, that's very beautiful, isn't it? You all should have one. I'll have to send some.
When you go to India, you can pick up something nice for them also. And you get lots of things for children in India, quite cheap and quite nice.

That's it. I can see that. That's really good.

For me? [the little child gives a biscuit to Shri Mataji] All right. With the hand, now you have it. Woah! Also, have some more. Thank you.
Good!
Baby: Nana.
Shri Mataji: Nana. She is Nana? All right. So, for Nana, what do you want to give her? Nana. What do you want to give her? Nana.
Baby: Kumkum.

Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Mother of baby: Do you think he could have a name [unsure]

Shri Mataji: Abraham is such a nice name, you see.
What is a better name than Abraham?
All right. You are having some more.
[Laughter]
So happy!
Really, these small, small children are so sweet.

Imagine.
His name is Abraham. What is a better name than Abraham? I don’t think there is anything.

You can just call him Adi Guru, that's all. Abraham was Adi Guru, isn't it? Better to say that way. Direct!
It’s good! You don't have much teeth, aren’t you?
[Laughter]

That's why, you see, the children want something to be done. They understand that they cannot take the biscuit that way. So
It’s food. More? More, I’ll give you. I'll give you more.

Biscuit is over?
Children are so entertaining. They keep you busy all the time. They bring forth so many joys and apart from that, they’ll find how to play out of everything. "Now there's a chair, if I make it into some sort of a playground", you see. Anything they find, they will do it. While – OK? ‘Atcha’ [all right], what do you want? You want more?
