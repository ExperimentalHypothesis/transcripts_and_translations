Miracle

Note: This where the 'Miracle of the Biscuit' took place. Shri Mataji was waiting for Her flight at Melbourne airport at the end of Her Visit, Abraham (the youngest one) offered Her his partly eaten biscuit. Shri Mataji then gave a piece of the biscuit to each of the children and returned the biscuit to Abraham in exactly the same partly eaten form in which he had given it. https://sahaj-az.blogspot.com/p/memories.html
