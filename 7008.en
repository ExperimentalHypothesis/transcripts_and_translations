Talk yo yogis. Ganapatipule (India), 27 December 1988.

You all have been very kind to Me, but I am very happy that you have been so kind to My husband and My family as well and you have appreciated the way they have been supporting Me in Sahaja Yoga. 


I did say that the bureaucrats are the ones who always go to wrong gurus because their attention is different. They don't want to have Self Realization, they don't want to have something subtler, say they are worried about their jobs and things like that.
So naturally they go to wrong gurus and try to get into troubles and invariably I have seen most of the bureaucrat's have been to all kinds of funny gurus and they have come to Me and said that, "We've got cancer, we've got this, we've got this trouble." 


But I didn't mean that they will go to hell, but I did say it's rather difficult for them to enter into the Kingdom of God because they believe in another kingdom, they do not believe in the Kingdom of God. But I must say I have lived like a bureaucrat's wife, also, and I have also seen what sort of people they are. Whatever it is they get very much touched by your love.


Throughout in our lives I have been taking very active part in his official things in the sense that, I would prepare breakfast for his union leaders, who came from Calcutta, or I would go to his ships and get them decorated and I would speak to all the people in the office, I mean, it was quite an intimate relationship and everybody now even says that whenever we travel they want to know about you, they want to ask about you, even in the United Nations when he's working as Secretary General there with the I.M.O. I think the people somehow or other, look forward to something that is love and that is serene, very surprising it is, that people understand these things even when they are so much in the gross. 


But now the whole Cosmos is working it out for us. I think the attention which goes to these things always helps, the whole Cosmos is working it out, we have so many hopes now before us, as far as Gregoire is concerned and Rajesh is concerned, these people first came to Sahaja Yoga they were very brilliant-intelligent people of course it took some time for Me to put them right. But once they saw the point of Sahaja Yoga they were first concerned because they are very socialistic people, concerned about other people. Gregoire would bother Me so much about everybody else, "Mother, what's going to happen to them, what's going to happen to this side, what is going to?" 


So I just told him that "Don't worry about all of them."  There's not much place in God's Kingdom, so you don't worry. First of all you establish yourself, you just don't worry about these people that they should be all right, they should be transformed, why don't you do it this way, also they thought I was little shy of publicity and things like that. I said, "I will do the way it has to be done, the living process has to work out slowly," and gradually it started working out properly.  We got the right type of people, who grew up in the most mature manner and they are mature today and they can now work it out. 


So now what about the Kingdom of God? We have to bring the Kingdom of God on this Earth. But to manifest it it's important that all the Sahaja Yogis have to be honestly Sahaja Yogis. Now regarding Mr. Srivastava I have to say one thing that he's an extremely honest man, he's so honest that if he finds Me doing something wrong he'll put Me to the jail. His sense of honesty really beats Me. But there's one thing good about the honesty part of it, even if people are honest and they know what is right, they may not do it, they may not accept it, and they may not use it as a life style, but his is a case where honesty is his life style. For him honesty and discipline is life style, so now once he has accepted Sahaja Yoga as something honestly, as he told Me, "I cannot be dishonest any more about Sahaja Yog, I see people being transformed, I can see it, so how can I be dishonest about it."


So now once this happens then all such people, Ayruss used to say there's some kink in these honest people in the government and they are the ones who are so honest compared to all others that sometimes it used to surprise Me. But now this honesty is going to play the part- with the bureaucrats, with the people who are in higher positions, who are at the helm of affairs, its going to work out, this honesty and this honesty if they want to make it into a life style they all have to go or dissolve into the Ocean of Sahaj. There's no way out. 


Because if you believe this is the honest thing and the truth, and if you are honest, it's just like you put the diamond in the proper platinum. It's cannot be anything else, that's why I have great hopes now. Like Gorbachev has come, he's a very honest man and he believes in his honesty of his faith and everything. Like that we have many other people also who are coming up and you will be surprised one day we'll come in their honesty, they will understand that peace is important and secondly transformation of human beings, and that point if it breaks through then Sahaja Yoga is there.


So as you know that Sahaja Yoga is not meant for few or for very few individuals, it is collective. But it is made for the whole of the collective and it has to work out that way, but as you know I have never contradicted Myself, but gradually I have opened you all to the truth because I didn't want to blast you, but it is now you can see the future of this world, so beautiful and I am sure in our life's time we'll see that beautiful time coming.


May God bless you.
