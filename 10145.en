Three Yuktis for the Progress in Sahajayoga.

         

          Today is the fourth day of Navratri. To dispel darkness it is important that we bring in the light at night. Today is also special because you are celebrating my birthday. On this day Shree Gauri had created Ganesha. Shree Ganesha is the epitome of Purity and Holiness. The first thing that was spread in this world was purity, by which all born things and all humans be protected and may keep away from unholy things. After that only the rest of creation was created. So the most important work for us is to make purity the highest thing within ourselves. Purity does not mean that we bathe, wash and keep ourselves clean. We should keep our heart clean. The greatest malady of the heart is anger. When anger enters a person then all purity gets destroyed. Because the other name of purity is love which is completely clean and straight forward, that love that flows eternally and wants nothing-Nirvajya. It’s satisfaction is in the fact that it keeps flowing and when it cannot flow it becomes disturbed. Purity means that you fill your heart with love and not anger.

           Anger is our enemy and also the enemy of the world. All the wars of this world, the failures have been due to this collective anger. There can be many excuses for anger. Even the terrible things like war comes from anger. If there is love in the heart, then anger cannot arise. And if one has to make a show of anger then even that is for love. Whenever any evil person or Rakshasa is killed, that is also done by the power of love because he was worthy of being destroyed, by which he may not commit more acts of sins. But this job is not for humans. It is the job of the Devi who had destroyed them during this Navratris.

           So expand your heart and think whom do we love with this clean, straightforward and honest love. (Nirvajya) by which we do not think that this is my son, my sister, my house, and my things. You have risen to a very much higher level than the level of human beings. Because you are Sahaja Yogies, so your union is with the subtle power of God’s love. That power is flowing constantly though you. and it is strengthening and coloring you with its power. It is looking after you. It is feeling you with joy and sweet love. You have got united to such a beautiful power. We have to see how much place we have in our hearts for it. You have love for your Mother, but you should have the two types of love also, then only can the love for your Mother be complete.

          One type of love should be for yourself, that you are Sahaja Yogoes. We have got these powers in a Sahaj way. Now we have to see how to increase it. Many people do a lot of work for spreading Sahajayoga.It is a horizontal movement. Such people do not look within themselves. So they are not able to get the vertical movement. On the outside they can do a lot, run around, do this work or that, meet people. But they do not increase the power within.Now there are many people who pay more attention to the power within but neglect the outward Shakti. So the balance does not come to them. When people start developing on the outside only then the power within starts diminishing. And then ultimately they get drowned in the Ego, that we have done so much for Sahaja Yoga, we have worked so hard. Then a new life starts for them which is not at all Sahaja. But within they are empty. Then they get sick, go crazy or some great misfortune befalls them. Then they say 'But Mother, we had surrendered to you completely.Then how didi this happen.' The responsibility lies with you, that you kept on getting lost. Such a person gets off to one side and he is not able to associate with others. If they associate with others then it is only to bully others and show their superiority. They must always be in the front  and they must be given all the importance. Then they have forget that they must do something for Mother. I have seen people who came up at once.Then they started feeling superior and self important. Then there was no aarti performed there, nor wiping my photograph. They were full of themselves, and never consulted anyone. Then groups started and quarrels started.

          The thread by which you tied is your Mother's thread. You must always remain tied to that thread and remember that we are the children of Shree Mataji. No one is superior or inferior. Nor we do anything. This Param Chaitanya is doing everything. When this feelings comes that we did, we will do this for that, we are very great, then the Param Chaitanya lets you do what you want. You can go to hell or destroy yourself. It won't stop you because it respect your freedom. Then is another fault with Sahaja Yogies. We are a collective being. A one collective Virat Shakti. We are all one body. We are not by ourselves. In that body if one person or a few persons starts making their own group, then like the malignancy of cancer, where one cell starts growing separately, in the same way one such person can grow and devour the whole of Sahaja Yoga. And all my efforts will go to waste.

          We should learn from the ocean, which is the lowest and which gathers all the rivers into itself, heats itself and becomes vapour and gives the blessing of rain to the whole world. Its the humbleness is the sign of the depth. When we will become extremely humble and loving then only we will become large like the ocean. But if you think only your self importance and superiority then the problem will be that the Param Chaitanya will cut off, and you will get thrown aside which very painful to me. People who think I have done this or I have done that should immediately step into the background and see whether we meditate or not?

Are we able to meditate? How deep are we? Whom all do we love and how many do we love, with how many are we enemies? With in Sahaja Yoga some people have gone very deep. And there are many who are still hanging on the edge. When they can be thrown out cannot be said.

          I have said before that 1990 is a year which will open a new dimensions. You have to take a great leap, by which you come out of these surroundings and grasp the new thing. The progress of Sahaja Yoga is about to complete twenty years. To survive the first thing we have to imbibe within ourselves is purity, which is called with humbleness. If you are completely clean and pure then you can touch anyone and you will never become impure, because you will purify everything. Your nature becomes that of purifying. Whomsoever you meet, you will purify that person. What is there to be frightened of or to condemn anyone. If your purity is absolute then that purity has power and brilliance and such a person is so powerful that he can suck any impurity.

          Now some other people think only of their own progress. They think what have we got to do with others. We sit within our four walls and worship and follow Mother and we have nothing to do with the world. They remain cut off from others. But you are part and parcel of the whole one, then how can such question arise? If mother has said, it's alright. We are a part of Mother and how van we say no. Then you not got that sameness (Tadakari) with me.So the next Yukti is "Mother please come into my head, please come into my heart, please come into my thoughts, please come into each drop of my life." Whenever you say I will come. But you will have to say from your heart and without any other motive.

          When the thoughts comes I am doing this work, I have done so much for Sahajayoga, I have done this decoration, I put this alright, 'I did' then know that you are not a Sahaja Yogi. In Sahaja Yoga,all your Karmas become Akarma. (non doing). Then you will see that do I think like this? Why do I think that I am doing? Then it means that my union is not complete. When the union is complete then you become a non non-doer. Then you start saying 'it is getting done.' Only then you get the Yukti of complete sameness with me.

          The next Yukti you should understand is that I am not doing. Till you keep identifying with your body (are) doing something, because the Ego within you. When you come into the collectivity then you stop doing anything . You are the part and parcel and that work is being done.

          I am telling you these Yuktis  because you have to take a leap. Always assess yourself in this manner. Look towards yourself and see what do I think. Do I think about others that they are better than me, so I must learn from them? Do I see the good points or the bad points in others? We must understand this Yukti that if you are still half baked then it is due to your own self. Sahaja Yoga is a very great thing. But if something is wrong within us or we cannot enjoy it fully then the reason is that there is some defect within us. If you correct this Yukti then there is only joy. The pure joy-Neerananda and nothing else. Then what more do you want? Your whole countenance will change. Then is another fault with Sahaja Yogies. We are a collective being. A one collective Virat Shakti. We are all one body. We are not by ourselves. In that body if one person or a few persons starts making their own group, then like the malignancy of cancer, where one cell starts growing separately, in the same way one such person can grow and devour the whole of Sahaja Yoga.

           I want that on my birthday, your Birthday should also be celebrated that you may understand these Yuktis, and may you fill your life with purity and holiness like Shree Ganesha. With purity comes wisdom. Because purity is the same of love, and wisdom means love. If you cannot get wisdom and you cannot love, then it is no use of wasting your time in Sahajayoga. Now such a time is coming that everyone has to become firmly settled and you have to change yourself, and must change. We have a lot of faults. We have to make ourselves completely pure. After this change you have the blessings of a life that cannot even be described. Kabir has said "When you are completely blissful then what more can you say." You all should now come into that bliss (masti). And attain that state where you become blissful in that.

May God Bless You.
