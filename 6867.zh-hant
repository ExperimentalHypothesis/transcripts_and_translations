公開講座:違背了神的旨意

1983年3月31日 英國,漢普斯特城演講廳

從一開始我就很抱歉,今天這麼晚.我知道當某件事在神的眼中是非常重要的時候,所有的負面力量便開始計畫著如何拖延、如何阻攔、如何使其脫離正軌、如何妨礙。真是非常令人驚訝!今天,最好是由我來告訴你們有關於神的旨意,以及我們人類如何無時不刻企圖違背祂的旨意。

神的旨意其實是很單純的。祂是神聖的愛、祂是慈悲的、祂是慈愛之海洋。祂創造了這世界,然後創造人類,只為了要給他們生命裡最高的事--就是喜悅。喜悅是單純的,不像短暫的快樂一般有二元性。但我們是如何違背神、違背喜悅的,這又為什麼會發生呢?

我們的意識,就如你所知,經過我們的頭腦向下成長。而這向下生長讓我們遠離神。最終我們是要達到神。但是首先我們稍稍地偏離那與神合一的意識,是為了要瞭解自由必須被適度地使用。沒有經由訓練、教育,給予人類自由是無用的。你看過自由的國家。他們在自由之中建立了什麼?毀滅我們自己的原子彈!這是愚蠢的,這是愚昧。這是荒謬。但是我們已經都這麼做了。我們還以它為榮,我們仍然忙著讓我們的處境越來越糟。這就是我們做的事。這意識,我們人類自己的意識,被賜與給我們,好讓我們的自由被試探、實驗、觀察。到最後,擁有終極的自由,藉此你變成靈。

最終,你必須變成靈。

但當我們開始發展我們所謂的意識時,我們關注的不是靈。我會說,我們像樹木一般紮根於泥土中好站直生長;我們腦中也有像這樣的根。然後我們開始向上生長,向上生長直到長出葉子、花朵盛開、結實累累。但相反地,在達到結實的階段之前,發生在我們身上的是,我們開始製造出人造的葉子,並享受它們,我們喜歡人造物。一旦開始認同人造物,我們便開始偏離真實,走向負面的想法,或走向過度積極的想法,這些實際上是違背神的,就是因為這些讓我們製造原子彈以及這一切。

因此,確實有兩條使我們走偏的岔路。有些人喜歡走向左邊,或是負面的態度。他們毀滅自己、困擾自己、做各式各樣的事情,借著這些會讓他們用最悲慘的方式死去。他們自己患上各式各樣的疾病。他們折磨他們的身體;他們折磨他們所有的一切。然後另一條是右邊,在這邊是他們去折磨別人,去毀滅別人,去擊敗別人。這兩邊都遠離了神,遠離祂的慈悲與恩典。關鍵是從頭到尾都要走向靈性。唯有如此,才是朝正確的方向前進。但這個關鍵很容易地被人類破壞,因為他們有自由去這麼做。在他們的自我中,他們大量地破壞,當你們發展出人工化的輕鬆生活時,那麼已失去神的意識,祂的存在,祂就是那位導演這整出戲的。我們變得如此地意識到我們自己,然而我們覺得什麼都沒有錯。我們做這、做那、陷入各式各樣的問題之中。我們所做所為正是違反我們自己,而我們自己意味著神,因為神創造我們,並且祂愛我們。我們不愛自己。如果我們愛惜自己,我們不會濫用我們的身體、我們自己的系統、以及我們所擁有的一切,說著:「有什麼不對?為什麼不這麼做?」你必須愛你的身體、你的心靈、以及這個社會。你必須愛你所擁有的一切,因為神在祂的愛中創造了你。但愛本身已變成一個嚴重扭曲的字眼。

現在,濫交有什麼不對?這是愛嗎?如果我跟你說這不是愛,因為這是違反自然,會給你帶來麻煩,你會陷入混亂。人們也許會覺得這位女士很嚴肅,她很保守、很維多利亞式。聽著。這是事實。我們為何要做些會造成毀滅的事情?你不能創造你自己。你甚至不能為自己創造一朵玫瑰花,更別說整個身體了。那麼為什麼我們要違背我們自己?為什麼我們要違背這個我們所創造的社會呢?或違背我們所創造的整個國家或眾多國家?時下這些政客——他們在做些什麼?爭鬥。為著什麼?去看看他們。我不能瞭解爭鬥是為了什麼,是為了創造更多毀滅性的力量,創造更多恐怖的事物好去毀滅無辜的人嗎?那些無辜的人們只被簡單地警告。他們不知道該做些什麼。他們不瞭解為什麼明天他們就將要死去就因為一些人發了瘋!而那些瘋子坐在我們的事務指揮著。負面就是這樣在我們內在成長。使我們變得負面。這兩者都是負面的態度,因為他們否定了神。

否定神是我們犯下第一個罪。我們不畏懼神。祂是慈悲;祂是仁慈;祂是一切。但在祂的慈悲中,祂會毀滅這世界。祂不會容許更多違背祂的罪行再被犯下。甚至不惜毀滅。癌症是什麼?所有這些找上我們身體的疾病是什麼?它們不是別的,正是我們自己內在建造的毀滅力量。無須懼怕任何來自我們外在的攻擊,或是任何外星攻擊、外太空入侵也都不用害怕。不,沒有這些。我們應該知道這些攻擊都是在我們內在造成的。以自由之名我們已在自己內在積聚所有毀滅性的微生物。它是一個這樣的內建程式,我們甚至不知道這些攻擊即將到來,它們已經就位。而我們太滿足於我們自己,我們人工化的生活、繁文縟節以及膚淺的習性。

與生俱來的,在我們內在,存在著靈體,祂想要啟發你,想賜予我們自身平安、祝福與喜悅。你的這盞美麗的燈被創造是有其目的性。它必須被點燃。尊重你自己。在今日的字典中「尊重」這詞已經不復存在!尊重你自己。我們要尊重這盞有著靈體之光的燈,它應該要被點亮。讓我們也成為那盞光輝燦爛的燈。神已經為我們創造如此美麗的世界,但我們在我們的無知裡,在我們所謂的自由之中,已經毀滅了這麼多的東西。

看見人們直接地朝向地獄前進,這真令人驚愕。對一個母親而言這是她非常關心的事。如何才能止住這種墮落?如何把他們拯救出來?如何讓他們瞭解他們的價值、他們的可貴?你不應該把人類生命視為理所當然。這是非常珍貴的生命,由許許多多的過程所創造。它的創造是極度困難。不要忘了你必須變成靈,要不然你的生命就白費了。不只如此,整個的創造都白費了,因為你是創造物裡最高的,你是那個創造的縮影。

然而你要怎麼做呢?我們必須成為公開談論神的核心份子。我很驚訝地發現,這個國家的人不喜歡談論神。你不能談論神。你能想像這是怎樣的處境:你不能談論你的創造者,或這樣的信仰毫無意義?你們要不就是形成某種秘密組織,加入其中的每個人都不能說「現在我們屬於某個宗教」。神怎麼會有這些不同的宗教?只要去想想,祂怎麼會有分別的教堂、分別的廟宇、與分別的清真寺?我們怎麼能以神之名變得狂熱!你能夠想像嗎?這就是我們對神所做的事!我們已經變得狂熱。神點石成金,祂所碰觸的任何東西都變成金。但是得先有石頭,當祂碰觸人類,他們變成像囚犯一樣。這就是為什麼會有這麼多的宗教狂熱份子。因此,如何傳達「你是靈,你必須成為靈」這新聞、這訊息是個難題。

我的母語是馬拉蒂語,感謝神,我出生在馬哈拉斯特拉邦。因為這是聖人的國度。成千上萬的聖人住在這國家。這是傳統,它的靈性非常高。崇尚靈性是我出生地的傳統。「馬哈(Maha)」的意思是偉大,「拉斯特拉(rashtra)」的意思是國家。這裡的傳統是靈性而非酗酒、濫用藥物或是任何其他的「主義」。靈性是這國家的傳統,一位非常單純的詩人誕生于此,他的名字叫納德夫(Namdev)。他是位裁縫師,只是位平凡的裁縫師。但他寫下許多甜美的詩句——我會解釋他所說的。「小男孩正放著風箏。他看著天空,和朋友聊天;他跑來跑去四處談笑。但是他的注意力一直在風箏上。」然後他說:「一位女士正背著她的小男孩做家事——她倒水給丈夫喝、與孩子坐下、煮飯,然後起身清洗。孩子在她的腰上,正在休息。她的注意力一直在孩子身上。」「一位婦女在頭上優美平衡的頂著一壺水,與其他婦女一同行走。她們邊走邊談天說笑,但是她們的注意力一直在水壺上。同樣地,我們的注意力要保持在靈上。」

同樣地,我們在這生活著,這是荒謬的,我們並沒有將我們的注意力放在靈上而祂是生命中最根本的給予者。但每當你談及靈,人們認為這些都是廢話、不值得一聽。他們想要一次又一次地聽著那些俗事。如果是像保守黨或工黨的廣播節目,他們可以一連聽數小時——這類的世俗事務。年復一年你們都在聽。但如果有人說:「不,這全都是人為做作,你們內在有更值得你們去傾聽的東西。」他們認為他們還沒有要去聆聽這些事:「這位母親正在告訴我們的是什麼?」但現在,醒醒吧!在不同的層面上,我們要去瞭解這些人迄今所做的,而我們已接受。這麼多年來我們視為理所當然的一切已超過了界線。一顆星星在我們的內在閃耀著,那是我們的靈。

人們談論祂,談論神,然後又創造一個宣稱他們在執行神的工作的宗教。在「神的工作」中,女性綁起她們的大腿和拋光自己的肉體。想像一下!以神之名做出這麼恐怖的事情,理由是,「你必須要苦行。」你為何要讓自己受苦?「因為基督這樣做。」你是基督嗎?而這意味著基督所做的一切都白費了,所以你們之中一小部分人也得受苦!之前基督經歷過的一切早已遠遠足夠,因為基督是聖子。如果聖子必須遭受苦行,那又有什麼好偉大的?祂早已完成了這一切,祂為了我們工作。祂要在我們內在被啟發,這就是為什麼我們必須得到自覺。

坐下來問問題是最簡單的事,但最好是你們都得到自覺。這是今天最重要的事。當然,現況下人們是如此,所以這不會很快地成就。我非常肯定。我已盡我所能。提升靈量就像舉起崇山峻嶺一般。這真的像舉起萬山峻嶺。你覺得非常累、精疲力竭。但之後他們又不想珍惜。所以不要覺得失望,不要對此感到受傷。

我確信,慢慢地、逐漸地,在你的雙眼裡,人們會看見你的生命如何被轉化為喜悅、祝福與諒解。他們會看見你變得多麼地有愛心以及喜樂,然後,他們會相信你有著更為美好的生命。有些人處在這種不良的狀態裡,他們每件事都只看到黑暗的那一面。他們失望透頂、徹底放棄。他們就是放棄了。他們會說:「現在我們會隨之完結。我們已經做了所有一切,而我們現在一點也不想再多做些什麼了。」我曾在法國目睹。他們討論著世界的崩潰與近在眉睫的毀滅。他們談論著:「讓我們現在就死去吧。我們已經受夠了。讓我們遭遇最終的毀滅,無論是原子彈或是什麼的。毀了我們吧。」多麼地絕望!我可以瞭解會這樣想的人的絕望,會這樣關心的人的絕望。我也為此煩惱。我毫不懷疑人們會為此感到絕望。甚至霎哈嘉瑜伽士有時會非常沮喪,變得極度絕望,說:「放棄了,母親。我們已經隨之完結,我們再也無法承受。」不過我不知道如何把我的注意力從靈體上移開。你可以試試看,盡你最大的努力去移開注意力。你做不到,因為你就在那兒。因此,無論如何,你會奮力盡可能去拯救更多的人。所有這些在一定的間隔就感到挫敗的霎哈嘉瑜伽士,我必須說,你不應該感到沮喪。你要去維持你的勇氣以及諒解,如果你關心別人,如果你對別人關懷,他們會瞭解你,而你能夠讓更多更多的人得到拯救、解放,他們將得以進入神的國度。如同你正在享受的,他們也將會享受。

唯一的隱憂是你會覺得有這麼多人仍舊迷失。沒關係。你要努力工作。我們必須瞭解有諸多負面力量正在把他們往下拉。他們是無明的,他們不知道有超越這世俗鬥爭之外的生命。那美麗輝煌的永恆生命。但是逐漸地,我確信,這將會成就。特別是對這次會議而言。他們遭受許多的起起伏伏,而整件事令人喪志。

但我們仍必須瞭解,神的工作是被神所祝福的。祂將賜予你祂所有的祝福與協助,讓你能擔起你想要的責任。時間分秒流逝;現在只剩下很少的時間。時間即將用罄,這就是為什麼絕望逐漸增加。絕望本身把霎哈嘉瑜伽帶到這個地球上。你應該要感到更為堅強,去與周遭那些你所察覺到的阻礙奮鬥,成就這個創造的終極目標。

願神祝福你!

Now, ask Me questions if you have any, without any fear, but not irrelevant, stupid questions, you understand that. It’s not good. I would not like to waste time of people who have come to seek the Truth. So, please ask Me questions if you have any or we will go in for the Realisation.

No questions? Wonderful people! No questions at all? Yes, yes please....

Seeker: It’s not really a question it’s just I find it hard to hear what you are saying. Is there a way of adjusting the microphone or something?

Douglas Fry: He can’t hear at the back but unfortunately the microphone is at maximum so we’re not able to get...

Shri Mataji: You can’t hear?

Seeker: No. It seems to distort.

Shri Mataji: It’s not alright? What did he say? I didn’t follow.

Shri Mataji: You couldn’t get any words to yourself, did you say that? Same with Me, I can’t hear you. (laughter) It’s mutual but doesn’t matter. You see, even if you have not heard Me, makes no difference, nothing. Love has no language, and this Divine Power has no language, alright? Did you understand that much?

Seeker: Not that much.

Shri Mataji: Did you follow Me even that? I am saying that love does not require any language. It is an all-pervading power which is everywhere and, whatever may be the language, it makes no difference. It is a silent language which will work it out.

I was surprised some of the Sahaja Yogis who went to India were very silently meditating when I was speaking in Marathi or Hindi. And, I was amazed how they were so attentive. They said, “Thank God! We did not understand, Mother, what You were saying, so we were not putting out mind into it and we were just enjoying the vibrations.” Isn’t it surprising that they would sit for an hour or so just listening to Me in some foreign language? Alright, doesn’t matter, alright!

What’s wrong with your thing, you see? Acoustics are wrong? What’s wrong? They can’t hear Me.

Douglas Fry: The microphone is as loud as it can be and I think there’s probably a problem with the loud speakers themselves. Unfortunately we’re not able to get to the controls. We can’t get to the controls Mother like we can at Caxton Hall.

Shri Mataji: Alright? Sorry, for this, some sort of a mechanical problem. But doesn’t matter, the mechanics in you are perfect. I don’t know a word about this electricity business that you people have created, not a word. I don’t know how it works, but as far as your Kundalini is concerned, I’ll work it out. (laughter) There’s no problem on that!

Alright. The acoustics of this town hall may be wrong. Alright. Now, what should I do if they can’t hear Me? Can you hear Me now, the gentleman, alright?

Seeker: I think [Shri] Mataji, one of the things is you have a soft voice and at the end of the sentence the voice disappears.

Shri Mataji: What about Sahaja Yogis, you heard Me fully?

Sahaja Yogis: Yes.

Shri Mataji: There’s a little difference, I’ll tell you. I must confess to you very humbly, that when a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me I find it difficult to understand, but if a Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me, is easier. I must confess it’s a little deficiency with Me, is that. That’s why if anybody asks Me question, even in the first row, I’ll ask some Sahaja Yogi to tell Me what’s there, because My ears are, I think, little bit not so alright. So it is with you people also may be that once you get your realisation. Now, the Sahaja Yogis are sitting at the back and they can hear Me every word. So there’s something wrong with this voice of Mine, because it doesn’t adjust to your ears, for the frequencies, I think. Doesn’t matter, it will work out. Alright?

Seeker: The only thing is it’s difficult to understand if you don’t hear. Are You saying it’s not important to understand?

Shri Mataji: No, it is important to understand, but not to think about it. Forget it. Forget it. Don’t think too much. Whatever you don’t to have to understand, you better not understand because sometimes, you know, talking becomes a barrier, and listening is another barrier, and then thinking is the worst. Alright? (laughing) So, let us see how it works out. Alright? Let us see how it works out within. You will gradually understand what purpose My speech serves, gradually, alright? I have to speak with a purpose, but what is the purpose? That you will understand little later if you don’t mind, but just now you must understand the purpose of your life, that is your Spirit and get to it. Now is it clear what I said?

Seeker: That sentence, yes.

Shri Mataji: Yes, alright. Thank you (laughing). Now, let us put our hands towards Me, and Me towards you. Now, I think, you see, this also slips out. You see, I’m very bad at electrical things. I never know even how to open My radio. I am so hopelessly bad. So, if I’m making mistakes, you should not mind because I am nothing so mechanical, you know. I don’t understand.

So, what you have to do is to be relaxed in the sense that don’t put any strain on your neck or on your body. But sit straight, and no strain on the neck at all. Neck, we have strained too much. So, leave it in the centre, not too much at the back, nor too much in front, but keep it in the centre because this neck has a problem. Alright?

Now, you have to stretch you hands straight like this towards Me and close your eyes. That’s all. You have to take out your spectacles, if possible, because it helps also your eyes. And, take out your shoes, if possible. One should not have anything tight on the waist or in the neck, little bit loosen. If it is not uncomfortable, that’s alright. If it is comfortable then it’s alright. First thing is you should be comfortable and not disturbed. That is the main thing and not to have any fears nor any guilt. That is very important not to have any guilt. Whatever I have said I have not said for you, so you don’t have any guilt built in you. Just say, first and foremost thing, after closing your eyes that, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Say it thrice with full confidence. I request you to say that. Please say that, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please! This is how you respect yourself. You have no business to condemn yourself because you are the temple of God.

Seeker: Mother I am not guilty

Shri Mataji: Just say it in your heart, but with full confidence, not doubting yourself at all. For My sake, please don’t doubt yourself. Just say, “Mother, I am not guilty.” And, forget about what you have done or anything, forget the past. I am talking about the present, at this moment. So, just please say, “Mother, I am not guilty.” It’s a very important thing.

Now, keep your eyes shut, please don’t open them, because once the Kundalini starts rising, you have to keep your eyes closed, and the attention will be attracted inside and after it reaches the Agnya Chakra then you will become thoughtlessly aware. There won’t be any thoughts but you will be fully aware. So, please don’t open your eyes till I tell you. This is one thing you have to do. That’s all. Not to open your eyes till I tell you.

Now, the left hand should be towards Me, throughout. Left hand is symbolically indicative of your desire. And, the right hand is your action. So we have to use the right hand to express our action. The first thing, as I told you not to feel guilty but I know you are all feeling still guilty because I can feel on your chakras. Now will you please again say it three times, otherwise you’ll be punished for thirty-two times or sixty-four times. That’s the only punishment you have to have is to say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

Now, put the right hand on your heart. Heart. Here resides the Spirit, in the heart. So with the left hand towards Me, open towards Me, you have to say, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

Now, you must know when you are the Spirit you don’t need anybody to guide you because you will be enlightened by your Spirit and the Spirit will guide you, because after realisation, you develop a new awareness by which you are guided through your vibrations. So you have to put your hand down on the left hand side of your stomach where to say, “Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide? Am I my own guru?” Anyone of these questions you can ask ten times. Establish your confidence first, that you are the Spirit which is above, detached and is the source of joy, complete source of joy. With confidence you have to ask these questions. I am here to answer them. So, please ask the question in your heart saying, “Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

Put your hand on the left hand side stomach. Here is the centre for the establishment of your guru principle, your masters principle. You are the master, as I say, of your body, of your mind, of your intellect. You are not to play into them, but you become the master. You don’t need any guru. You become your own guru. That’s better now.

Now, raise your hand again to your heart. And now, with full confidence you say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.” This you have to say twelve times, because the centre of the heart has got 12 petals. So you have to say 12 times, “Mother, I am the Spirit,” with full confidence and respect of yourself, which you are. You are the Spirit, no doubt, but just assert!

That is how we are clearing our centres.

Now, raise your right hand to your left side at the base of your neck. This is another centre which gets caught up when we feel guilty. Now, those who have said that, “I am the Spirit,” you must know that Spirit can never be guilty of anything. It is a sinless, beautiful, brilliant diamond within you. It cannot get contaminated by any guilt. So, you have to say now here eight times, “Mother, I am not guilty.” For those who have always felt guilty can say sixteen times.

Now, raise this hand on top of your head, and put it at the fontanel bone area which was a soft part in your childhood and put your palm on top of it, on top of it, let it rest. And now move the head in a clockwise manner, pressing it down with your palm. Just press it down and move it in a clockwise manner. If you do it from the side you’ll do it better. Hold it from the sides, put your hand sideways, not from front, [then] you do it better. And now turn it, little bit pressing it down with your palm. Turn your hand, not your head. At this point, again, your freedom is to be respected. I cannot cross over it. So you have to say that you want your realisation. You can say, “Mother, I want my realisation. Please, may I have the realisation.” Please say it seven times, just pressing it. You must touch your head. It’s all hot, you can see that, the heat is coming out. You must touch it and press it down, and see such a lot of heat is coming out. Now, seven times you have to say it.

After that you can raise your hand and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in. This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So you can ask a question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Every one of you, you can change your hands now. You can use the left hand. Put the right hand towards Me, keep your eyes shut and ask the question, “Mother, is this the breeze...?”

All of you should get it, it’s possible! Change your hands again, if you want to. You go on changing, and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out. It has to be cool breeze. First the heat will come also is a good sign that the heat is going out, all the heat with tension and all that, is going out.

Hmmm! It’s working out. It’s very subtle. We are moving from gross awareness to a subtler awareness of the roots, so naturally one has to pay attention to it.

Little in front, it is not at the back of the head but little bit in the front side. Try one after another and pay attention to it.

It’s very hot today!

Hmmm. Now, without opening the eyes, again put back hands towards Me, like this, and see if there’s a cool breeze coming to your finger tips to begin with. Just put both the hands and see if there’s a cool breeze. Ask again the question, “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Ask thrice. Means the Kundalini, Kundalini is the Holy Ghost.

How is the lady?

It’s alright. Don’t worry, she’ll be alright. She’ll be alright. Don’t worry, don’t worry, she’ll be alright. Don’t worry, she’ll be alright. She’ll be alright. I am looking after her. She’ll come. She’ll be alright.

Now, if you are getting cool breeze in the hand, you can also now see it, if you raise your hand. Open your eyes and raise your hand, slowly open your eyes, slowly. Raise your hands like this. Like this, as much as you can stress, let’s see.

Yes. Are you feeling? Are you feeling the cool breeze? Are you feeling the cool breeze now? Those who are feeling should say, “yes.”

Seekers: Yes

Shri Mataji: Alright. Now just put your hands like that and see now if you are feeling the cool breeze.

Close your eyes and enjoy yourself. Just enjoy yourself. Close your eyes. At this time there are Sahaja Yogis here who will help you to completely establish the experience and to see if there are any obstacles. Sahaja Yogis should do it very carefully without talking and raise the Kundalini in some people if necessary in some people. Don’t talk to them, don’t touch them, just start raising their Kundalini. Slowly try to do it. Keep your eyes shut, they’ll work it out for you. Now those who have come for the first time and have felt the cool breeze raise your hands first of all. First time who have come and felt the cool breeze raise your hands higher. Yah, good. It’s good. So, please put down. Then did you see them? Can you work on them and see. And those who have not felt please raise your hands: at all, the cool breeze. For the first time who have come and have not felt the cool breeze, raise your hand.

Alan, behind you, the gentleman who could not here me. Alright, then it’s alright, he’s done. Now just see the people who have not felt the cool breeze. Please raise your hands please...this one gentleman, this lady, this gentleman...
