Shri Mataji: [Marathi?] Today is the combination of Shri Krishna, this one (is) his face and this is his dress. Ah, I think someone should go and find out from... Joan [Mother calls a Yogi]. Her sweater, her sweater is with ... she said she has given to Olympia her blue sweater. Light blue

Shri Mataji: What are the words, Vishnu’s names, in English. Better take it in English, better. (Mother talks to a baby-child [Marathi?]. Ah, better take her. Take the names. In English they are easy to take I think. Only the first, one should take them. Ah, does somebody has a shawl, [Marathi?] Ne, it’s alright.

Actually we should have Rasaali (?) playing with that, it would be nice, it doesn’t matter.

These are the names of Vishnu, because Vishnu only achieved the status of Shri Krishna who in his own life time expresses his complete form of Virata. Complete form of Virata. And this is a very good understanding, if you know that you are also, start the dharma, establish your Dharma and then you become a witness, and then you become part and parcel of the whole, the Virata. The same pattern takes place in you also, in the evolutionary process.

(silence) Next time you should do (with the English ?) names like that, it’s better, they should understand. You all should read it at home, you see, even if he is reading in Sanskrit, you all can buy one book each, (?), when you come to the program you should bring it so that you will have the meanings and you will know what means. You see, is better to read it in Sanskrit, no doubt, but it takes more time, I want you to do it with understanding, that is very important.

Mother and Yogis: laughing everybody

Yogis: Om Swaha

Shri Mataji: You are all part and parcel of yourself, and if something is wrong you better judge yourself, that’s the best part.

How much do you love?

How much do you respect the discipline, of Sahaj Yog?

You have to sacrifice something for Sahaj Yogis, isn’t it.

Just count how many things have you sacrificed so far for Sahaja Yog. We have gained a lot, but we have to sacrifice.

Yogis: Om Swaha

Yogi: All badhas of loneliness

Yogis: Om Swaha

Shri Mataji: And also those who are organising should not be dominating. They should be understanding and should know they must respect the freedom of everyone.

It should be mutual, it should be no something with a rod. Sahaj Yoga cannot be done through a rod. But if someone is trying that, you better accept it for the time being. But it’s not good for the person who is trying such thing, to use the rod all the time. 

Try to have [a] reasonable attitude for everything; reason it out. There’s nothing to fight, there's nothing to quarrel, there’s nothing to think that somebody is more dear to me and somebody is not. You see, those who look very dear may be at the bottom, so don’t do all that.

Just try to be kind to each other, try to understand, try to help, try to guide. If somebody has some weaknesses, all right, try to help that person. If somebody has weaknesses, he should not capitalise all that. It should be both ways.

But I can see a Golden Age coming now, so I don’t want miss that moment. I can feel it. That’s coming up, no doubt. Somehow I have a feeling now. And I have seldom failed in my feelings. Some Golden Age I can see along the lines. I am sure something great is going to happen.

May God bless you for this day. It was a great day.

And the birth of Shri Krishna, should be within us, within ourselves. So our Vishuddhi should be all right, balanced, witnessing; and control our ego and superego in such a manner that the Kundalini is kept above onto a higher level, the attention onto a higher level.

I think from today I’ll stop scolding you anymore!

I have a feeling [that] now we have to go very fast, and once I start running fast, you will have to run fast. Then you will have no time to quarrel. 

May God bless you all

Yogi: Bolo Shri Jaganmata, Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all! Thank you very much for celebrating this birthday of mine. Thank you very much.

Yogi: Thank you for coming on this Earth

Shri Mataji: You see, according to Indian way, they count even the first day of birth. Like if you have to say how many years you have, according to them I am already 60 and I am going to be 61 and after 61 you can take sanyasa, so it’s a big freedom!

Thank you very much to all.

Yogis: thank you
