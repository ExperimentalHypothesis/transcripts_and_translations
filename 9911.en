Havan on the day of Puja to Shri Krishna as Yogeshwara, 1982-08-15

Bahjan: Govinda Bolo

Child: what's happening? .... Mother is coming.

Bahjan: Govinda Bolo

Indistinct voices of children

Sahaja Children: questioning Shri Mataji [Marathi?]

Shri Mataji: [Marathi?] Her blue sweater, just find out from Olympia's Mother. .... [to the child] please sit there.

Child: Did Olympia's mother come?

Shri Mataji: [Marathi?] Today is the combination of Shri Krishna, this one (is) his face and this is his dress. Ah, I think someone should go and find out from... Joan [Mother calls a Yogi]. Her sweater, her sweater is with ... she said she has given to Olympia her blue sweater. Light blue

Child: Light blue

Shri Mataji: What are the words, Vishnu's names, in English. Better take it in English, better. (Mother talks to a baby-child [Marathi?]. Ah, better take her. Take the names. In English they are easy to take I think. Only the first, one should take them. Ah, does somebody has a shawl, [Marathi?] Ne, it's alright.

Actually we should have Rasaali (?) playing with that, it would be nice, it doesn't matter.

These are the names of Vishnu, because Vishnu only achieved the status of Shri Krishna who in his own life time expresses his complete form of Virata. Complete form of Virata. And this is a very good understanding, if you know that you are also, start the dharma, establish your Dharma and then you become a witness, and then you become part and parcel of the whole, the Virata. The same pattern takes place in you also, in the evolutionary process.

Now lets have (the names).

Yogis: Om Swaha

Shri Mataji: and also those who are organizing should not be dominating. They should be understanding and should know they must respect the freedom of everyone. It should be mutual, it should be no something with a rod. Sahaja Yoga cannot be done through a rod, but if someone is trying that, you better accept it for the time being. Is not good for the person who is trying such thing, to be using the rod all the time. Try to have a reasonable attitude for everything, reasonable, there is nothing to fight, there is nothing to quarrel, there is nothing to ahh... think that somebody is more dear to me and somebody is not. You see, those who look dear maybe they are not. So don't do all that. Just try to be kind to each other, try to understand, try to help, try to guide, somebody has some weaknesses, all right, try to help that person. If somebody has weaknesses, you should not capitalize all that. It should be worthy, but I can see (?) is coming now. So I don't want miss the moment, I can feel it, that's coming, no doubt. Some how I have a feeling now, and I have seldom (felt ?) in my feelings. So some golden (age ?) I can see (along the lines ?). I am sure something great is going to happen. May God bless you for this day. It was a great day and the birth of Shri Krishna, should be within us, within ourselves, so our Vishuddhi should be all right balanced witnessing and control our ego and superego in such a manner that the Kundalini is kept above on to a higher level, attention on to a higher level. I think from today I'll stop calling you anymore. And I have a feeling now we have to go very fast, and once we have started very fast, then you will have to run fast then you will have no time to quarrel. May God bless you

Yogi: Om Shri (Radanna Pratini) Nirmala Devi Ki Jai

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all. Thank you very much for celebrating this birthday of mine. Thank you very much.

Yogi: Thank you for coming on this Earth

Shri Mataji: You see, according to Indian (?), they count even the first day of birth, like if you have to say how many years you have, according to them I am already 60 and I am going to be 61 and after 61 you can take sanyasa, so it's a big freedom.

Thank you very much to all

Yogis: thank you
