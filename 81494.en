That's one time where I was full of sympathy for Pat. That was one of the tests in your life. I think at some point, Shri Mataji told you to pour the water. The bottles... I still remember that because I thought, "Gee, this is going to be tough for him." He was brave from the moment Mother told the people in Gavin's home, "You should drop drugs." The feeling in the group—and you put it in your book—was, "No way." And then Pat said, "Okay, I'll do it." I remember that. When he said, "I will stop," it was like time stopped, because the group was really not taking the message.

I remember you on your knees in front of Mother saying something like, "Forgive them, they know not what they do." It was true, and it was very dramatic. You were the only one taking Her side; none of the others were. That was the only time I saw you, I think, until we went to India. We met in Mumbai first and then went off to Kathmandu, but that was the only time because you stayed with Mother, and we didn't see you.

"Okay. That was the first time. Was this when I had those ridiculous white clothes, or not?"

I was telling friends about this. Shri Mataji told me, "We're going to see the yogis." When I came from the U.S., I had an American army jacket and jeans, and that's how I knocked at the door. The army jacket was torn, so I said, "Oh my God, we're going to meet the yogis." I went and bought a sort of Elvis Presley white outfit, and on top of it—I must have been out of my mind—a red bow. I arrived, we climbed the staircase together, and I looked in the room. I took my bow out; I couldn't take the clothes off, obviously. Mother made fun of me for this for quite some time. That was it... "We're going to meet the yogis, my God, the yogis!"

There were only one or two yogis there, and even they were very new. The whole room was full of the local crowd. I saw them all there and thought, "Oh my God, what's going to happen here?" They were quite a bunch. It was only my second or third time. That was during the trip I came over from America.

"Was that the second trip to see Her, or was it the first trip?" "No, that's not the first trip. It must be the second one. I think it was around the 20th of August 1975." "It was the 15th of September when we first came." "Oh, so it must have been after me?" "Yes." "Oh, I didn't know that. Okay, so that meeting was after that. That was my third time or so."

Because I got lost, you remember? I stopped—well, I put it in the book—because I was trying to help this wretched Ignatius get to Mother's house. He didn't turn up, and I failed to make it. I got lost. So I went off the wagon, spectacularly, that weekend. I remember going 'round there, and you were singing, "What a Difference a Day Makes." It was a bit feeble, but I was in such a state. The thing was, it meant so much to you to miss it. Even then, you understood what you had missed.

But what is sweet, though I cannot tell you when, is that we pretty soon had a few more brothers and sisters.
