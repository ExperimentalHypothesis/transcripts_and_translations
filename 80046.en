I mean fifty percent of people are understanding what Gavin has said. They don't  have problem about it. But those who have come for the first time, today shouldn't  think they have been here for the first time. Perhaps we do not know how many lives we have been seeking. If we were not seeking before, we would not have been  seeking in this life so desperately. And many a times in India, I told people that so  many saints, who were in India once upon a time, seeking in the valleys and in the  mountains, even in the Himalayas are now born in the West and they are seeking.

It’s a fact, but only problem is that when we are seeking in the dark, when there is no  one to guide us, on the contrary there are more to misguide us, those who have an  interest in our faults, in our disturbance, or we can say in our destruction, all such  people now come to misguide us and to take advantage of us. At such a point and  under such circumstances, the saints, the real seekers, the people who are genuine  are attacked first. Because the satanic is all the time on one side it is destroyed and  on the other side it is trying to find out who are the seekers.

It is not today, but since the time of Rama, you can say, even earlier, even much  earlier. You can say eight thousand years was Rama’s time, even much earlier,  everywhere a seeker was tortured. But now in these modern times they have  become very subtle. They’ve learnt methods of subtle invasion. And before we  realise where we are, they attack. They find us. At the time of Rama, the saints... as  there are angels guiding the saints, the satanic forces also gathered together and  tried to exploit the situation.

Thus in these modern times, what we call as Kali Yuga, we are faced today with an  atmosphere of complete confusion. Even a true seeker doesn’t know who is a real  person; to whom to go, whom to approach or where to get it. What should we do? We  are frantic. And in that franticness, a tremendous amount of damage has been done to  your own being, inside.

But, Gavin said about my compassion. I would say, it is a feeling of complete anguish,  when you see real seekers, genuine people; the people who are simple hearted, innocent,  they are my own, dragged into problems. The whole compassion gets into anguish. The  mood of compassion, becomes an anguish. So, instead of getting angry with you or  getting in anyway upset with you, I try to find out how I can really soothe you: how I can  really cure that part that is destroyed in these genuine people.

But you have to be genuine to face the reality. If you are not genuine, you cannot face it.  You cannot face it, neither you can accept it, because it is too much for you. But if you  are genuine, the genuineness gives you the strength to bear the reality. But reality is not a  heavy stuff. It’s the lightest stuff. It make you very light. At the edge it’s just like beautiful  showers. In Sanskrit, there is a word ‘Tushaar.’ I don’t know what you call that in English  language. It’s a beautiful word which means that when you are, say, standing there near  the sea, the waves come and throw all that little, little droplets on you. That’s called as  Tushaar. And that is how it is, ocean of love just breaks near your heart and throws small little drops of its love on your being and the whole thing is beautifully worked out. It has to  be that way for people who are so much injured and all so wounded. The whole awareness has come. Everywhere! But whatever we have been so far thinking  to the truth, is not true. There is something of the beyond, even through the scientific  approach, even through the psychological probing, we have been able to see through,  that there is something beyond.

Now what is that beyond case? Where do we have to go? What are we seeking? Really  what happens to us? It is not known to us, because it is an unknown quality. And  whatever is known to us has been known to us, mostly by people who are not themselves  been there: has been committed by someone or somebody has told them.

Incarnations and the great prophets who came on this Earth to talk about the Kingdom of  Heaven, you know what was their life. Nobody listened to them at all. Leave alone,  nobody became even a little part of them. Nobody got realisation and this was the  biggest problem and this was to be solved. Unless and until you are realised, everything  becomes a mockery.

Yesterday I was very happy to visit Tunbridge Wells. It was a very nice programme. What  surprised me the most, the way people accepted it and it was very interesting the way  people came forward and received it. Now I found there... Some people were doing  acupuncture, some were doing healing, some were doing... in all goodness! They did not  mean... They did not understand, because they are doing it out of love, out of  compassion, out of feeling for others; just a simple feeling like that, but they didn’t know,  that most of them were not realised.

So there was a gentleman, who was very nice person, no doubt. He was very nice person  himself, but he was not a realised soul and he was doing acupuncture. Now this  acupuncture comes to us from Tao. I don’t know if you have heard about Tao, Lao Tse!  Lao Tse was a great saint. He was an incarnation of the Primordial Master, which has  incarnated many a times on this Earth. Even Moses was the same, you can say.  Muhammad Saab was the same. There was one Raja Janaka in India, he was the same.  Nanaka, he was the same. So we had many incarnations of that principle and he, Lao Tse  was also one of them, but Lao Tse was there, high up in the air, you can say or something  very, very much different from normal people here. So for normal people to understand  Lao Tse was an impossiblity.

Now whatever Lao Tse did, long time ago, because we are not authorised; you have to be  authorised to do. For example, now there is this mic, which is working, which is  connected. Or in Sahaja Yoga we can say which is realised. Means it has realised its  utility. It has become what it has to be. It is not yet incomplete. So when I speak in this  mic, you all hear. But supposing it is not, then what is the use of talking on this. It’s not  going to say anything, it does not to do anything, it’s not activated? It is not working.  That’s why when you are not realised, when there is no realisation in you, means when  you have not found the fulfilment of your instrument. Then you have not become fully the  one that you have to be. When the self knowledge has not come to you, then whatever  you do becomes a outside thing, you can call it a mockery sort of thing, but the person  that is in it, does not know.

For example, somebody who comes to telephone and he says that telephone is out of  order. He says, “Alright, then I will not telephone.” But supposing he does not understand what does that mean “telephone out of order!” And he’s a villager, for example, he’s never  seen telephone. So he will still use telephone? You must telephone.

In India there was a village, so our washerman said that “I must work.” I said,”Alright for  whom do you want to work?” He said, “I will go to Jawahar Lal Nehru.” I said, “But he is  not contesting the election from here.” I said, “In India, they said he’s not standing for  election.” He said, “Doesn’t matter I can work for him sitting down.” It is something like  that. You see the activation of your being is expressed through yourself only when you  are connected; that your Self Realisation is one of the most important things.

But say for example when I am making this instrument, when we are preparing it, then  what should the instrument do is to keep quiet and watch? So the way is very [unclear]...  but before it was down, it starts running up and down, here and there. Did all kinds of  things like that, it gets spoiled. In the same way, in your seeking, if there has been a  problem out of ignorance, out of the cunning of others, how do you think I would be upset  with you? Because I understand this is a problem, that makes me much more concerned,  much more involved and much more absolutely dedicated to you, that you have to get it.  It is your birthright and you must have it and that’s how you get it.

Now Self Realisation, this process was not done before at all, in this way, en masse, it  was not done. Some may say,”Why not this? Why was it difficult only one person among  a million used to get it?”

[Break in Recording] 

... minds of seekers that I have seen in the West and it is not surprising. I cannot  understand why should such a person come into your mind at all. This is a thing where I  really fail and that I do no know how to answer you. I mean supposing I say there’s a  diamond. Will you question me? You reject it. To see at least is it a diamond, then how  will it be free? You may jump in at least to see what it is like.

But what happens to people when they see things, that it is just so simple, it acts it takes  no time, it’s just like this. “How can it be?” “We have heard about kundalini, many  [unclear]”. You have to go into rigorous imprisonment for years together and and the guru  has to kill you. I don’t know what they do. Take out your kundalini and put through like  a.... like a training to a [unclear]sort of a thing and this happens and that happens and  people cut their throats, cut their noses, stand on their heads and go round like mad, until  you are actually famished and you never get it. And after that I don’t know whether they  get it or not. And when you read the books of kundalini, you get really frightened and  when I say kundalini happens the people are frightened there and then. Actually I told  them to change the name. Don’t write kundalini because kundalini means serpent’s power  and the serpent power is the one who is [unclear]. All these wrong ideas about kundalini  have corrupted you, because of the people who wanted [unclear]

It would be something like this, some very ingenious people in India. We too have some  geniuses, great geniuses, you see. They used a very ingenious method. They wanted to  smuggle some whisky; Scotch Whisky, from the airport, because it was difficult in those  days of prohibition and they could not do it. So they thought best thing is to have some  books of Gita.They have some books of Gita; boxes made like Gita. So the Gita, being a  scripture in India and made a hollow thing inside and put the whisky bottle nicely. And all  these big, big, big, big Gita books were coming in a great truck, you see and nobody  would object. “This is very nice.” “Very nice whisky coming in and we are having it.”

Doesn’t matter, what is there if we are little bit maligning Gita, doesn’t matter. We will put  so much money to your temple and finished off for good.

So there now so this is what it is, that, you see when, when we want to sell something  that is destroying, some thing that is junk, that tastes horrid, how do we do it? We have  to or [unclear] the holiest of holy?

They walk like this, you see. Who are these people? They are the people who are  planning how to rob the bank. You should find some three people or four people,  seriously walking like this, you see, with their umbrella and a complete English dress.  Instead, in the back must be somebody who is trying to see how they plan to loot you.

They plan all this in such a beautiful manner the whole thing, the whole plan that is very  attractive. They must make it attractive. They have to make it and there are so many ways  and methods. Actually somehow or other the have become [unclear] practice of this  cunning all their lives. So many lives they have become so good at making money and  they loot you. While you people who are simple are just [unclear]. They say, "Mother, how  can it be, kundalini is rising just like this?” On the contrary, if you are wise, you think it  over. How can it be difficult, because it is a living process?

It is a living happening as part of your evolution. What did you do to become a human  being from a monkey? And now what are you going to do to become that transformed  human state? What expertise can you do about it? It has to be a simple step, like your  own brain, like your own face, like your own eyes. You've got your eyes. Why don't you marvel at the miracle of your eyes? If you see there is a complete camera inside them. It’s

such a miracle! We take it for granted the eyes are like this “Oh, oh what beautiful eyes  are these!” We take them for granted. Let us think of a miracle. These eyes from where  have they come?

There's a wonderful book written in (inaudible) in which it says that it is impossible to  believe, that law of chance has worked out human beings, that through law of chance we have evolved to be human beings is an impossibility, because by the law of chance we could be at the most... there could be one amoeba produced from there.

It's such a complicated human mechanism that has come on this Earth. It's impossible to  work out. But all the kundalini knowledge, all the kundalini science so far and I'm really...  I'm amazed! I mean that's your Mother. And a Mother that is a loving Mother, it is the  compassion of God within you, which was made for these days to get Realisation. But  people are doing something I must say. When I say that you do not do anything about it.  It works out. People don't like it. They want to go through all kinds of problems and they  want to do all kinds of wrong things. They want to be hit all the time. Keep hitting! Why?  God never does like that? It is done in the simplest way, in the easiest way, in the most  comfortable way, so that you don't even feel the pinch. But according to Kundalini  Shastras, so called, that these tantrikas have horribly spoilt, you see. You have to burn  yourself and you must see the kundalini rising, burning you and there's a heat in the body.

Actually, it is the cool breeze that you feel. It is written in the scriptures that you get a  wind of the Holy Spirit. You should get it, "the wind of the Holy Spirit.” and Kundalini, if  She is a part of that Holy Spirit, how can you refute this? When you try to do something,  for which you are not authorised, then She punishes you. It is not She who punishes, but  there is a deity who is sitting down there. At the first centre down below , you see, in the  red centre. She is there in the pink centre, She is there and the red centre that is where there is a deity and it is the same deity, who incarnated on this Earth as our Lord Jesus  Christ.

This deity is the embodiment of innocence [unclear] It can, to persuade you, to [unclear]  you, to tell you "Oh God is great!” These people are false they are trying all kinds of  nonsense.” A saint can't exciten sex. [unclear] I mean this is something that is beyond  me to understand, how by doing sex have you become human beings from monkeys?  Can you connect it, in anyway? Thank God, we can see our brain is here, our heart is here  and sex is down there. What is the connection in our awareness if these have anything to  do with sex? Do you find a man who is very sexy, in anyway, much more aware than  others are? I mean this is it; that those who are supposed to be the people who are  awakening and writing all kinds of horrible things, do you find that spiritually they are very divine people? No, I mean would like to know. When they confuse kundalini  with sex, is it in any way sublimated?

When I ask about Christ, because at least you know Christ. I know you say there may not  be [unclear] but Christ who was a celibate person!

Sex has its own path, marriage has its own path, everything is granted, is there and more,  but it has nothing to do with your spiritual life. That's the fact. If you have sanctified sex,  it supports. But how do you confuse these two things is really beyond my small brain. I  cannot understand, that from the way the people are, you must judge their spirituality. I  mean, you have known that people who have been drinking aren’t they stupid? In a way  that’s true. They are not divine by any chance. Then how do you connect, such advanced  spiritual people, with God? In which way do you find them divine? It's a simple common  sense. Apart from anything, whatever is a fact you’ll find out yourself. So the Kundalini is  much higher in the pink triangle, where this Ganesha is sitting down below to protect the  chastity of his Mother.

So the sex and Kundalini has nothing to do, even saying this is wrong. I mean, it would be  something like doing sex with your mind, as Freud believed into it. He might be doing it,  is it not? He was... He had horns, I think, in his head. I don’t understand it at all, but you  people have suddenly accepted just like that? For what? Have you heard anyone person,  any single mad man has cured himself or not, apart from his idle stance. He had a very  unhappy life and if you read his own personal life. It's a scam! I mean when you see their  own lives they have been through. I mean are we going to be like Freud ourselves. This is  verified and qualified. You must see his own life. You must find out what sort of a person  he is. What does he do? How does he live in this world? How has he spent his life? What  has he achieved? And then finally before somebody says something, must we come in?  After all, if somebody says that I have attained some spiritual life, alright, then let see how  he behaves. That is common sense. What does he give?

You should see his own life, or we should see his own feats; how he acts. If you put this  test on all these put together, all these gurus put together; all these fake and false and  horrid people put together [unclear]one worse than another. They must have keeps. I  mean in no scripture, it is described that a divine man should have keeps. There are all  kinds of funny relationships with their disciples. Like an eighty year old guru will be  carrying on with an eighteen year old.

Just now today I asked Janie a very simple question. I said that on the roadside, but not  in India [unclear] but here, that the people, the young people are hugging each other and  loving each other. And what are they doing under these circumstances? Supposing a sixty year old man is carrying on with a sixteen year old girl. Do they do it on the roads?  She said, “No, that they don’t do.” Why? Because you know with your commonsense  that everybody is going to laugh at your silliness and your stupidity of it. But these old  Johnnies who are pampering, I don’t understand [unclear] and the ones who have written  about kundalini also. Have they told you anything about themselves or have they given  anything good to anyone whatsoever? I mean these are the common sense questions if  you ask, then you will know how true they are.

The reality cannot convince you, because mentally it cannot convince you, but it can only  make you understand that this is not reality. This is not reality, it is something else. But  when you face the reality, you start seeing it and it is so tremendously different. But if I  tell you, that sitting down here I am feeling all your kundalinis. It's a fact. Not only me!  Not only me, but all those who are realised can feel your kundalini and say there is  kundalini. And you’ll also feel when you get your realisation.

But this force, this dynamic force is not active only in this room. It is active all over, it has  sprouted. As yesterday the gentleman said, like [unclear] It is there. It flows and acts and  works and how it looks after you. That you have to see for yourself, because you are not  in that yet. You have not yet touched the shores of reality. That's why you think that these  governments and these economic and these, what you call, political institutions and even  spiritual institutions have sucked you in.

They are doing nothing. It’s all a mockery going on and the only One who is the Lord and  the King is God. And the One who really reigns over the whole world and the universe is  He. The One who has all the powers, the telecommunications and all kinds of communications. It is He. All are just, you see, like puppets. He is the One who is using  His strings.

As the prologue, you must have seen the prologue. In the ancient times, even in England  they used to have a person like a puppet, you see. He used to give the prologue and he  used to continue to tell all about how the movements are going to be. In the same way if

the prologue is done by somebody else, while the puppets are gripped and you think it is  the puppets who are the thing. But "God,"he said “Yes, yes we believe in God.” "We have  a picture of Christ.” "Oh we knew do believe in God.” No doubt, and also you see “We  believe in God.” "Yes, yes, we do believe.”

What! Why! Have you found it ? Have you got it? (Inaudible)

You are now at the point that you should get it. You will get it. So many of you have got it,  but you have to little bit settle down with it. Because I have told you that there has been  lots, lots of damage has been done to you by people who have ideas saying "This is  reality.” They don't introduce you to reality. Nothing's happened within you, but they gave  you ideas, "This is reality.” Then somebody gives you ideas; like.... when I was coming to England supposing somebody says "Oh England is great!" and “in England this  happens and in England that thing happens.” But I come here, I find things have not  happened and I am sure that, "This is not reality.” Or if somebody says, “England”...  Some body describes England like say South Africa. When I come here I find, "Oh, so  this is not real.”

Because these ideas have come to you from all these horrible, superficial, cunning, useless, materialistic people. You have accepted their reality, but reality is very different  and very beautiful to be faced. Each one of you should face it and have it and enjoy it. It is  for all of you to get it. Nobody can certify for you. You have to certify yourself.

Now here! You have some chakras as I told you about [unclear]. Innocence is the first  one. Second chakra, which you see on the chart, is the yellow one. In between the pink,  triangular bone in the spinal cord, at the end of the spinal cord is found the Kundalini.  Here sits the Kundalini. Now why is it called as a serpent power? I mean it is something  horrid, because any power, even electricity moves upward. And they thought that these  three coils moves like this. It’s better to call it as serpent’s power. But it is not the power  of a serpent.

You see when the adjective is used before the noun, then it is not true that the adjective  becomes the noun. So once you say it is the power of a serpent everything goes wrong.  Now so that if this is like the power of a serpent. Then he bites you. You might get..., you  see all kinds if dancing poses and you can even take out your clothes, you see, and  everything can happen. Every sort of thing can happen to you, as soon as you change an  adjective for the noun and the noun for an adjective. Only in religion, they do like this  [unclear] but not anywhere else. You will not find this mistake committed anywhere else.  They are very particular. But in this one when they say, “serpent power” that means it is  like a serpent, but at it minimum it has something to do with the serpent. It is [unclear] It  is horrid. It is extremely heating up. It is not [unclear]. It may finish you.

You’ll be surprised that kundalini can never harm you. You know we think that electricity  can be used for good purpose or bad purpose. Atomic energy can be used for good  purpose or bad, but not Sahaja Yoga. Try! You cannot! If you want to kill someone  through Sahaja Yoga you cannot. You can try. All of Sahaja Yogis can try, but you could  not, but be careful because this is divine. Pure! It will be something like saying that  nothing so pure in this world, but I can say if the water,... see you can say, water for  washing and people can say, “No, the water wasn’t washed!” But we can use the same  water for spoiling something [unclear]. We can say that you can remove something.

This is not the quality of divine vibrations. It is not. Why do you think you can use for  both purposes? That’s why I said there is nothing so pure...I’m speaking only for me. As  the divine vibrations which is never soiled and it never, never can be used for any bad  purpose.

As soon as you start thinking about something bad, vibrations will stop immediately. As  soon as you think of harming someone, your vibrations will stop, finished. As soon as  your mind goes to some sort of a destructive plan, vibrations stop. That’s all. You get  convinced and so many things happen that you cannot do, any if you try to do, you lose  your vibrations altogether. It’s very [unclear]. So you cannot use it for any bad purpose  that is absolutely sure and certain. Now see how beautiful you are made.

Now, I’ve told you the red one, then the yellow and the green and then you have got the  blue. This one just like snow and here is the white [unclear] this thing and then on top  [unclear]. These seven chakras are there and all these seven chakras one by one.

If you see in the chart, you have got the full idea about the seven chakras, the deities that  are sitting on them and how they help and what is sympathetic system, what is  parasympathetic,, what is left side, what is right side of the man and what is the lower  side. The lower side of man is the hell part. The left side of the man is the subconscious.

The right side of the man is the supraconcsious; by which you plan for the future: the  ambitious part. And here is the superconsciousness above the mind.

So the attention has to go up, up, up and break this. That is the baptism as you call it.  Break this part and become one with that subtle being which is universally the same.......
