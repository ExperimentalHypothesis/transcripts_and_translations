Puja for the 61° Birthday (Be sweet, loving and peaceful), Juhu, Bombay (India), 22 March 1984.

I have just told them (Indian Sahaja Yogis) that you should not try to copy the western style of ego-oriented society where people use harsh words, because then we think that we have modernized ourselves. To say harsh words to somebody, “What do I care! I hate you!”—All these sentences, we have never used, these are unknown to us. I mean anybody to say like this is unmannerliness. How can you say such a thing: “I hate you!”.

But now I have heard people talking like that in our country. “What is wrong with us?”. “Who are you to say that?”. Like that we do not talk. This is not the way we talk. Any person who comes from a good family would not talk like this because this reflects on the family. But the language is more copied here than in the western countries. I am surprised the way the people talk here in buses, in taxies and the way they use the language that’s something I can’t understand. And so I have asked them that the language should be full of love and with our own traditional style.

We wouldn’t even scold our children. If we have to scold our children, we use language which makes them honourable (Bahumanav): Damle Sahab has put on a kurta pyjama, so “You are looking like Shivaji Maharaj. Welcome Shivaji Maharaj”.

We should speak in such respectful language so that they would not get scared. Correction if it is to be done, we used to do it this way; but the correction of the other side is not proper because it never corrects. That’s why you cannot control your children. All the time you are scolding them, insulting them, insulting others.

Insulting methods and emotional blackmail and all this nonsense is not at all traditional in this country, and those who try to do this will be thrown out. You should not do them, I can tell you, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot do it.

You should not have all these ideas of insulting people, of bringing them into situations where they can be insulted. This is all modern style. So we should not do like that. In Sahaja Yoga, we should behave in such a way that we should be dignified, behoving our style, our tradition. Sahaja Yoga tradition is that we talk to people in the most sophisticated manner, the sweetest manner, in the most affectionate manner and inviting manner. And that is how we should all speak.

So, this is the first thing I ask that in your expression of love there should not be a thing that you shout. I do shout at people who have bhoots in them, but by that the bhoots run away. But if you shout, you get the bhoots; bhoots do not run away, they get attuned, so better not do it. If you have my powers; you can do that. But you don’t have.

So be careful, you don’t try my tricks, you see, I’m different type of a person and I do say things understandingly, which you do not. So when you follow me in things I am the way that I am on the side that I forgive, the way I am loving, I am affectionate and not the way where I am terrible. Because my terrible nature has got an undercurrent of my Love which you don’t have, nor those powers. So don’t try these tricks with anybody else. You have no right to shout or get angry, because if you should, you get back all the bhoots in you. For they are the ones who provoke you.

They provoke you to get caught up into it and you get absolutely ruined, the more you try to do so. Therefore, the best thing is to stand in the centre and to have affection and love, the power that I have given you. That power you have to develop—that power of love. First develop that power of love, then you don’t have to worry, you don’t have to shout or do anything. Your power will become (Krita), (active), it will work out itself and create that beautiful atmosphere that we do not want to have anybody ruined.

But if you shout, people will run away. Specially in a ego-oriented society, you cannot shout at all, it cannot appeal to them. If you shout in ego-oriented society this will distract them and they will run away.

So I have to tell you, that you might be highest of highest, first thing that you have to give me today that in your talk, in your behaviour, in your heart, you will reside one with Love.

The second thing I have to ask is that you be peaceful. Try to have peace with yourself. Now don’t fight with yourself. Now, the western people have one problem that they fight with themselves. “How is this that this is happening to me? I am this! I am so bad! I am no good.” If you go on fighting with yourself then you will not progress. On the contrary, you should say that, “I am so good. What’s wrong with me? I have got my realization, what’s wrong with me? There is nothing wrong with me”. Have that confidence in oneself, and then it will work out. Not that you start shouting at others, but supposing you understand that there is nothing wrong with you. You have to be peaceful. You all have to be very peaceful. You have seen, my peaceful nature has solved so many problems just like that. You have to achieve that peace within you. That peace has not to be lost at any cost, should not be expressed outside. In a way, My peace itself becomes terrible. You don’t have that kind of possibility. Don’t do it, never do it that way, try to be extremely peaceful, keep your forehead relaxed.

Many people come to me with face like that (distorted, twisted face) and I see bhoots sitting in their forehead, then I shout at them, forehead relaxes. “I am not doing anything, “Mother is doing everything.” Relax. If you relax you will find that your heart opens out. Some say that my heart cannot open. Why can’t you open your heart? Because you have no trust in yourself. Try to trust yourself. It will open your Agya, open your Ekadasha, open your Sahastrara, and your heart will open. Once the Sahastrara is open, the heart will open automatically, so you will have a peaceful life.

So today I am asking for two things from you. It is a funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift. The first gift you have to give is that you should express peacefulness through your own character. But it does not mean that you should be people who are timid, or people who are morbid or who tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid of anything. You are not going to bow down to anything, compromise with anything, but you have that sort of a temperament you should develop and express—is very important.

And the second one is that this peace and all this should express your love— Love to others. Like, now, in everywhere in next two-three years you will have Ashrams, I am sure. And in the Ashram, I will like to see Loving, caring, affectionate, patronising beautiful attitude for the people who come there. On the contrary if you do not have this, Ashrams will be reduced to zero. It has happened in many places. You don’t blame me why our Ashrams do not run. It will be your responsibility to see that it is Mother’s House and people are coming to the Mother’s House. How Mother will treat these people, with love, affection. Whatever you do—you can starve, but give to others kindness and sweetness so that the impression on the people, that people will think he is not an arrogant personality. I want top class persons to be in charge of an Ashram. If the person is mediocre, he should not be appointed. By next year you will have all the lands in your hands and Ashrams will start by next year.

May God bless you.

On my birthday today so that you be properly established by the end of next year, but first two conditions should be there. If you are not ready for that, God will never give you an Ashram. He does not want to give Ashram to some funny people. It becomes such that some people have no place anywhere, come in the Ashram. So unless and until you have people of that calibre who remain loving and peaceful then the Ashrams will be established.

You should be able to have Ashrams in every place.

May God Bless You.
