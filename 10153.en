Talk to Sahaja Yogis, translation from Marathi

This is a nice coincidence that I have come to meet you all here in Kharegone. These are ancient coincidences, of lifetimes, and we will not be able to understand how they come to happen because we do not know about our past lives. So these are coincidences from past lives, and that is why today once again in this life have I have got this great opportunity to meet you all.

01:34 I can not express in words to say how so very overjoyed I am to come here. I know that Sahaja yoga will reach the rural areas in a really good way because people who live in the cities think they are very intelligent because they read lots of books (well-read, educated) and if they are not educated then on the basis of having the power or wealth they think they are something very special. They think that they have created this whole world, they have created this sky and think of themselves in the place of God, and there is no such thing as God. Whenever they do some bad things, the thought of God never enters their minds, that we are doing something against the Dharma. 02:39

Even today the people from villages have a sense of the existence of God. Our land of India is a Yogbhumi, and Shri Rama and Shri Sita purified this land by walking bare feet here. In the people of rural areas there is a sense of simplicity and that innocence, and devotion towards God, many people misuse it, means by telling lies they make money, by telling them some kind of made up stories about God they try to create some kind of funny feelings in them to get money out of these innocent people. This is happening in all the villages, it is a very sad thing, but Shri Shankara (Shri Shiva) is sitting behind all these innocent people, and he is protecting them all. God is pleased by the innocence of the people, and he is always standing by their side to help them. But for even a single moment you should not forget about God. All these simple things if we remember that, we can not purchase God, and if someone who believes in God then he will never try to make money from you in a wrong way. If he tries to make money by fooling you then he is not a man of God. For whatever reason he might be asking you for money, you should say, “look, I do not want anything to do with you”.

04:49 Other thing is that in cities there is a lot of diseases as compared to the rural areas, it is very surprising, the reason for that is the atmosphere, pure air and auspicious work. People are very pure-hearted, But our Sahaja yogis have worked very hard to reduce the diseases. And once you have got your self-realisation in Sahaja yoga, then you will not need any medicine or doctors. All kinds of physical or mental troubles disappear for good. You don't have to give any money in Sahaja yoga, you don't even have to work very hard for it. Like a seed can sprout by itself, just like that the seed inside you gets sprouted. You have that seed inside you and the scholars have given it a name as Kundalini. As every seed has the sprouting built-in, you also have to sprout within you. But if some seeds are a bit funny, or not developed properly, then it takes some time to sprout. I only water it with my love, and what else can you do, the seed sprouts by itself, in the same way, the seed which God has placed inside you sprout by itself. But only thing is that if you have a light (candle) which does not get enlightened by itself, it needs to have a candle which is already enlightened to light it. In the same way in Sahaja yoga, only the enlightened lights can enlighten other lights. And when they get enlightened they can go and enlighten other lights. this is how it works, but some wicks in some lamps are not in a proper place, some lamps might be broken, or some lamps do not have enough oil, so even that can be put right, Kundalini is your Mother, who takes birth with you in every life, and stays with you, and you know what a pure thing a Mother is, and this purity is your Mother, and she is waiting for that moment,07:35 to come in contact with someone full of love, and when she sees such a person in front of her, she gets awakened, and you become realised.

07:37 Today we are going to have an experience of that here, and I hope most of you people will feel it. It happens so spontaneously that people find it hard to believe that how could we have got it so quickly because they think normally people have to work very hard for it, they have to do fasting and they have to do this and that, and should need to go in the jungles and do a lot of penance. Now let's say about 50 years ago if someone did not know the way to come to Kalwe, so it would have taken him a very long time, but today we have come by car so it hardly took any time, but before it would have taken him not just hours but many days, today we just set off from there and got here (quickly)

08:37 So in the same way as we have progressed in the outside world, just like that if the tree has grown outside then its roots must have grown also, but you will not understand the growth (progress) of the roots, because you can see the progress of the tree but not of the roots, this is the work of the roots. And when you find the source of a spring, when the roots touch the source itself then there is no question of that tree dying, however big it might get it will always have the water. In the same way in this modern kaliyuga Sahaja yoga has been discovered, and everybody should benefit from it, only thing is that there is no place for shallow people, I mean if they going to make fun of it or call names then even if they feel the vibrations, they will be lost. You have to have faith in God, because if someone does not believe in God then why should God help them? When you say, “Shri Mataji please heal my child”, but you don't have faith then why should I heal him? 09:49 Just think about it, even if out of my love If I say, “OK I will cure you”, still those Deities who is going to cure him, they have to agree to it, Shri Hanumana has to agree to it, Shri Ganesha has to agree to it, Shri Shankara, Shri Krishna has to agree to it. that this person deserves our help otherwise there is no need to help this person. If these people are just very shallow and have only come to get cured then there is no need to help them.

10:31 There are many people has been cured by Sahaja yoga, many diseases have been cured, and so many have got their realisation, and those people who got their realisation they are also helping to cure other people. In Sahaja yoga only thing you have to know that a human being does not know everything about himself. He does not know that what happens to him after he dies, what he was before taking this birth? or what is going to happen in the future, he does not know anything about himself. So you have to follow some rules in Sahaja yoga, one thing that is nobody should let anyone put kumkum on their forehead, you should only allow another realised person to put kumkum on you, and nobody else. So now you will ask that Shri Mataji why it should be like that, so like we say that, someone’s hand is very good for doing this or someone is very good at doing that, somebody is good at farming or somebody is good at medicine, the reason for that is we have vibrations flowing through our hands, if someone has very bad vibrations flowing through his hands and he touches your forehead then you will also get bad thoughts in your head. So you have to look after your forehead (agnya chakra). This is one rule in Sahaja yoga because God has made this forehead (agnya chakra) with great care, and you should not just bow in front of anybody. If you go bowing your head in-front of whoever and if he is a demon (rakshasa) then the bad qualities of that demon will transfer into you. So if you follow these simple rules then you will grasp Sahaja yoga very well. And Sahaja Yoga is a really a very big blessing, you really would not believe if people told you their experiences in Sahaja yoga, once a Sahaja yogi was travelling by train, and the train had an accident, but nobody was injured, there was also a small child who was thrown far away but still he was absolutely fine, people were so surprised that how can that be, so you are saved from accidents.

12:45 So now you will say how does that happen? now we have very big faith in Shri Hanumana, and always taking his name and all that, and there is also a temple of Shri Hanumana, but we do not realise that Shri Hanumana is everywhere, only thing is we are not connected, otherwise with just one call he would be standing before you, not only that but if a Sahaja yogi is going about who has a connection with God then Shri Hanumana is always there to protect him. Shri Ganesha is everywhere, we think that Shri Ganesha is only sitting in the temple, he is existing everywhere to help everyone. If any Sahaja yogi is in trouble then he is always there to help him. We all say that yes there is Shri Hanumana, there is Shri Ganesha, we want to celebrate the birthday of Shri Dattatreya, and Shri Shankara and everything but we do not understand that this body of ours has all of them inside us and they are looking after this body, you will not understand this until you recognize God.

14:03 Like now I am speaking into this microphone and if it is not connected with the mains then you will not be able to hear me at all, just like that unless and until you become one with God, or until you have not got your self-realisation, God will not hear you, despite you keep calling him. We keep calling God day and night, sometimes as if God is just there to serve us, like do this for me do that for me, do this for my father, do this for my son, but what right do you have to ask God? What have you done for God? What connection do you have with God? Let's just say if you wanted to meet your Minister, then you have to send him a letter and ask for permission, but if you just go and say that oh Minister comes here and do this such and such for me then you will be arrested by police isn't it?

15:00 So you have to have the right, and to recognize that you have the right is when someone gets their self-realisation he feels cool breeze blowing through his hands, Shri Adi Shankaracharya has said this, and that is happening today, it is not just talking about God, today we can prove the existence of God, you can prove it. So this path, They say that it is not for lousy people. To walk on this path you have to have that devotion, simplicity, and innocence, and the desire to know God then you will reach tremendous heights. Nobody is going to become a saint by wearing orange clothes and shaving their hair, the sheep get their hair sheared every day do they become saints because of that? Nobody is going to become saints by wearing orange cloths, or doing anything outwardly. We have had so many saints in this country, take Saint Tukaram, he did not take to sannyasa. No Saints has to take to sannyasa, because a saint becomes a sanyasi from inside. 15:58 You change from inside, your nature changes from inside, so you don't have to show anything outside to show that you have changed. Whatever has to happen, happen from inside, you feel that within.

16:23 Now some people might feel that they have started feeling the cool vibrations in their hands, but some of them might not feel, ten people might feel it but four people might not feel it, so those four who didn't feel the vibrations will start saying that, “oh this is just some false things”, so then these ten people who actually felt the vibrations will also go away with them. Because human beings are like that like they have half of a brain. This is a very new experience, and you need to give it time. You might say that it should happen just like that, and it does, but to get the real experience you need to give it time, you need to work at it. You have to work at it after getting your self-realisation and not before.

17:10 They have asked me to come here to Kalwe, and I don't know what other programs they have arranged, but I would have liked us to go into meditation, and get your self-realisation. And then if you have people with any problems (diseases), I would see to them also. Now if you have any questions, you can ask me, I will be very happy, do you have any questions?

(someone asks a question, but not quite clear)

Shri Mataji: Now the cremation ground, normally it should be out of towns, but people think that there is space here then why not have it here (in town). Here in Mumbai, there is a cremation ground and where they have made a playground for little children, so these small children are going to suffer or not? All these graves are there, human being do not even think about these things, the modern man does not have this kind of intelligence, and in the same way, they have built the colonies, so you should take some kumkum and things to protect yourself, later on when you will find out that what kind of a thing you were saved from, you will be really surprised. This is why people become mad, they get ill, they die but they don't understand how, and why they got all these troubles. Even the small children, because you do not have any idea about yourself, then how you are you going to know about anybody else?

18:41 Now take a simple example like a Temple, now you go to a temple, you bow down before God, and that is all very well, and it is all-important, but if there is a Pujari who is a crooked person (corrupt), let's say, and if he is doing some bad things, or he is into black magic and things, and if gives you the prasad, then that is going to affect your stomach isn't it, so how are you going to know that? If you are just an ordinary people then you are not going to know that, but if you are a Sahaja yogi then you will start to vomit straight away, you won't be able to keep that in, and then when you come home you will have pain in the stomach, having to go to the hospital and all that, so they will say we don't know what has happened. And you are only going to know about these things when you get to know yourself first, and then you will know others also. You have not recognized yourself yet, you have to find out about this amazing power you have inside yourself, and as soon as you recognize that, you will be able to know straight away that how corrupt, bad somebody is, also you could save yourself from such person. But how are you going to know all this? So first you have to find out about it.

19:56 Shri Mataji talking to the seeker who asked the question in Hindi: So you can go there and learn all about it, all these people (Sahaja yogis) are all masters of Kundalini.

Shri Mataji pointing towards some yogi, saying: this person has cured thousands of people, his son is a doctor and he has cured so many people. And these people tell me that since they got their realisation they have never taken any medication for anything what-so-ever, now you take your realisation and try to understand it properly and work at it. So as I said that in Sahaja yoga it is not like that you take your realisation and then you forget about it, no, you have to find out everything about it, to know how it works. Because let's say if I provide electricity but do not tell you how to switch it on then how would you know? You have to find out the complete thing. So you will have to learn about a couple of things like how to give yourself a bandhan and foot soak, just small things like that, you don't have to do much to keep yourself alright. Maybe you only came once and haven't been for a long time, so you have not learnt much.

In Hindi

(person saying that he has not been for a while)

Shri Mataji: That is why, but it won't do, you have to make some effort, this is Gods work. Now people take years to make (unclear) years, then this is Gods work, you have to at least learn something about it, things like which fingers we use to do what in the Puja, how we offer the flowers because everything has a meaning, all these little things, but you don't have to know so much just now, but you have to learn some of the things.

21:40 Shri Mataji: do you have any more questions? So does some young people want to ask questions?

Shri Mataji: Now about drinking alcohol, we don’t say that you don't drink, but after coming to Sahaja yoga you won't be able to drink alcohol if you drink you will vomit straight-away, you won't be able to drink. Also if you smoke, you will have trouble. If you smoke a cigarette after coming to Sahaja yoga you will be in trouble. You will not feel like smoking. I do not tell anyone to give up smoking, but it just happens automatically.

22:18 There was one person in Singapore, his wife brought him to me and she said please help him to give up his drinking habit, and he got his realisation, I don't know-how. After that whenever he tried to drink he use to smell some fragrance, so he just uses to enjoy the fragrance and forgot about his drinking. 22:35
