As Anand says, one of the things that I think people will be really interested to hear about from your experiences is not just when and where you got your Self-Realization, but the circumstances. Quite briefly, where was your head, if you like? What were your circumstances at the time when you found Shri Mataji and found Sahaja Yoga? So perhaps if I start with Chris, and then we'll just work around. When you started, how was the inception?

Chris: Were you just wandering around and suddenly you saw a poster, or were you desperate? It's quite an interesting story. It would take me a couple of minutes to tell you, but I was seeking. I'd been seeking for a long time in a sort of intellectual way. I hadn't identified with any particular cult or anything like that. And one day I saw in the NME, the New Musical Express, a little advertisement saying that on such and such a day—it was June 5th, 1978—Shri Mataji would grant en masse Self-Realization at Caxton Hall. It didn't mention Sahaja Yoga at all, just said this.

I was fascinated by this because of this idea of collective, en masse, but Self-Realization, the individuation. It aligned with all my kind of mental conclusions that this is what we need to change the world—something that is collective, yet also individual at the same time.

So it so happened, because I had no money in those days and I lived a very lazy sort of life, that some friends were moving up to London that day to Holland Park. I got a lift with them, and I went along to Caxton Hall. The guy who was moving was a guitarist, and he had a band. They needed a name for this band; it was a kind of acoustic jazz band, very nice music, actually. An old school friend of mine had come up with this name, which he'd found in a book about medieval Indian religion. And the name was Sahaja.

When I got to Caxton Hall, I was a very self-conscious, shy kind of person. I had a dread that I would be invited in, and it would all be sort of happy-clappy, hugging each other. So I came to Caxton Hall, and on the outside, there was this big poster, and it said, "Sahaja Yoga." I thought, well, this is a sign, if ever there was one.

So I went in. There were some leaflets on the chairs before the meeting actually began, and they said something about who Shri Mataji was—that she had been married, for example. I was of a very skeptical turn of mind, but I just did not doubt this somehow. And Gregoire gave the introduction, which was a very strong one, calling on the deities to support what he was saying. Then Shri Mataji spoke, and I couldn't actually make out everything she was saying, though she spoke perfectly distinctly.

Then there were some questions, and she turned to me. I was sitting in the middle. I thought, if I sit at the back of the room, then they might say, "Everyone at the back move to the front." If I sit at the front, I'll already be in the firing line. This is my intellectual way of thinking. So, I sat in the middle.

And she looked at me and she said, "Ah, an intellectual." I had very, very long, thick hair and some John Lennon specs. And she said, "You won't find the answer in books." I heard myself saying—because as I said, I was very shy—but in front of all these people I said, "Yes, I know that." She said something else; she actually told me I should get my hair cut, because entities can get in hair like this.

I think she kind of knew I wasn't going to run away. The people worked on me, and they said some things about what they felt which were astonishing to me. How could they know this? I just felt that this is a matter of destiny. I'd always felt that I was in this world for some purpose, something to do with the better. And so I never looked back, although I didn't feel very much myself for a long time.

Interviewer: Pam, was your experience similar?
