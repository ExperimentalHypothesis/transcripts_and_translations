Shri Mataji: Now what music?

Guido: I think Patrick has organised something. [Unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: We have a professional, Shri Mataji. So, I let Jean-Louis tell us the program for tonight.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi aside]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, let us start with a few songs written in French and dedicated to our Holy Mother.Shri Mataji: We can start, I think, first of all, we can start with Shri Adi Shankaracharya to begin with. And then we can start. Because that sets in the vibrations and everything well. It would be good.Guido: Adi Shankaracharya.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi about music]

All right. You arrange first of all, all the musicians to come this side [towards the left side of the stage] And- it’s all right, it’s all right. After all, we have so many musicians from so many countries.Sahaja Yogi: Every body wants to sing now.Shri Mataji: It’s all right, come along. You could move a little bit this side, some people [towards he right], so the musicians could all stand that side [left]. We have a huge choir I must say. Come along, come along.

Sahaja Yogi: Let’s have the musicians this side and the singers the other side. Please.[Shri Mataji is laughing because of the big mess]Gregoire: Shri Mataji, he is fantastic. [Name] ask for an hour now.

Shri Mataji: Move on, move on. Let them move that side. Can you move this side? You are all musicians? All right, all right. Come along. Now I think some of you have to come that side. Most of them are musicians, you see, that’s the problem.Sahaja Yogi: The singers, on that side please.
