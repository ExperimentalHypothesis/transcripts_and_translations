Please be seated

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, before starting his performance, we have a surprise for mister CP and Yourself.Shri Mataji: Oh.Sahaja Yogi: Because you are traveling both on each side of the world, and I heard that mister CP has not been in Pune for quite a long time. And we have sent our photograph reporter to Puna and he is getting a surprise for You. Christian!

Shri Mataji: You have already surprised me with so many things, now what’s that.[Christian gives a photo album]Thank you very much, thank you. Ah! That’s it!

The limit. Oh, I never knew. You are a surprise. [Hindi]Sir CP: For me it is a real surprise, I’ve not seen it before.Shri Mataji: Look at that. See the ‘makandu’ [unsure]![Hindi]Sahaja Yogi: Wandana just got her visa in time. Her pictures of Shri Mataji’s house being built in Puna.[Applause]Shri Mataji: This one is a real surprise, I tell you, because mister Shrivastava has not seen even the land. [Laughter]And he says, "When it will be all ready, everything fixed, I’ll just go with the key". [Laughter]Sir CP: When the creator is there, why should I worry.Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. He says, "When the creator is there, why should I worry". [Applause]

Sir CP: Thank you very much. That’s a very, very wonderful surprise from him. It’s first time I’m seeing my own house. [Laughter][Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Now what music?

Guido: I think Patrick has organised something. [Unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: We have a professional, Shri Mataji. So, I let Jean-Louis tell us the program for tonight.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi aside]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, let us start with a few songs written in French and dedicated to our Holy Mother.Shri Mataji: We can start, I think, first of all, we can start with Shri Adi Shankaracharya to begin with. And then we can start. Because that sets in the vibrations and everything well. It would be good.Guido: Adi Shankaracharya.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi about music]

All right. You arrange first of all, all the musicians to come this side [towards the left side of the stage] And- it’s all right, it’s all right. After all, we have so many musicians from so many countries.Sahaja Yogi: Every body wants to sing now.Shri Mataji: It’s all right, come along. You could move a little bit this side, some people [towards he right], so the musicians could all stand that side [left]. We have a huge choir I must say. Come along, come along.

Sahaja Yogi: Let’s have the musicians this side and the singers the other side. Please.[Shri Mataji is laughing because of the big mess]Gregoire: Shri Mataji, he is fantastic. [Name] ask for an hour now.

Shri Mataji: Move on, move on. Let them move that side. Can you move this side? You are all musicians? All right, all right. Come along. Now I think some of you have to come that side. Most of them are musicians, you see, that’s the problem.Sahaja Yogi: The singers, on that side please.

Shri Mataji: I think some people can move this side, those who are not going to sing.Sahaja Yogi: Shh, please.Shri Mataji: There’s no- somebody has to arrange. Nick, can you arrange for their sitting? Some people who are sitting next to this side can move on that side, a little bit. Now, won’t you sit down? Just there, if you can move a little backword, all of you, a little bit. All of you move a little backward so that they can be seated. Let’s do this fast.[Arnaud is giving instructions in French so that people move backward]

Shri Mataji: Now, better be seated, I think. Better be seated. All right. Sit down, sit down.[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Nick, please, see there are some wires there and I don’t want the children to touch that. Next to that, yes please, as there are certain wires and things. Just tell somebody to look after that part.

This is Shankarcharya? Give them one [a sheet on which there are the lyrics of the song "Adi Giri Nandini" by Shri Adi Shankaracharya]. [Hindi]

Then, in this one, when he says, "I am Shiva, I am Shiva, I am Shiva", he is meaning that, "I am the Spirit. I’m not this body. I am not this intelligence. I am Shiva". Throughout it is like this that, "I am the Spirit". And as you know now, you all have become the Spirit.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.] [Sahaja Yogis sing an English version of this.]

May God bless you. Beautifully done, very good.[Applause]Guido: "Adi Giri Nandini", Adi Shankaracharya.Shri Mataji: Ganesha? Or you can, I think that "Nandini" one is good because that creates this [movement of Shri Mataji's hands meaning vibrations] then we can start with anything else, all right?

Where is Akbar, I don’t see him? Akbar? He comes? Oh.Sahaja Yogi: He has got his Italian passport but he’s not yet arrived.

Sahaja Yogi: He is following me Shri Mataji. [Laughter].

[Sahaja Yogis sing "Adi Giri Nandini", Sanskrit.]

38:46Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. It’s beautiful. It clears you out completely.

I think that you can sing some Hindi song that they can understand. For their sake, some Hindi song. One of those, once- I don’t know which one you could sing.Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]Shri Mataji: Which ever you sing proper, a Hindi song.[Conversation in Hindi.]

No, no, no, this one. Because we have had a fast one, so let’s have a little slow one now. Which page? What page it is?Sahaja Yogi: Page 2, Hindi songs.Shri Mataji: Page 2.These are, non, non, no. On page 2? Sorry, sorry. Ah, yes, it’s there.

[Conversation in Hindi.]

[Hindi bhajan]

[Conversation in Hindi.]

Shri Mataji: He is saying that it’s all my blessing that has made them so much congenial to Indian music. And [Applause]Now, which one you’ll sing?Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]Shri Mataji: Jogawa, tike? You see this is, [Shri Mataji explains in Hindi the meaning of this Marathi song, sung in the villages of Maharashtra.]

You don’t have ‘Jogawa’ with you?Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Mother.Shri Mataji: All of you?Sahaja Yogi: Children know Jogawa.Another Sahaja Yogi: The children know, learned it, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Children know it?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: That’s good! You all children know, good, good. That’s very good.You know by heart. Melania? Melania? Hello, Melania, you know this Jogawa? All right. Sit down, sit down, all of you should sing.Sahaja Yogi: They learned the song during the camp.Shri Mataji: Atcha.Sit down, sit down, sit down. Give a room. Give a room.Sahaja Yogi: Let the children sing.Shri Mataji: Non, no. I mean, you have to support them. Start it, all right. Let’s see.

Shri Mataji: This is the rhythm.

[Bhajan Jogawa, ancient version]

Shri Mataji: You already have got this Jogawa. You’ve got your Yoga, isn’t it? So, now you are asking it that means: what else?Sahaja Yogi: Deeper and deeper.Shri Mataji: Deeper and deeper. [Hindi]Now any one of your songs, we can have some French songs?What has happened to your piano?Sahaja Yogi: He is sleeping, full of vibrations.Shri Mataji: Full of vibrations.

Sahaja Yogi: The first song Shri Mataji, the name in French is, "Tu es la Mère" "You are the Mother"."For the one who goes ahead on your way,For the one who receives the love and the joy of the Divine,For the tree, that the rain grew up,For the day and the night which can in You be united,You are the Mother, the truth,You are the playAnd You are God

For the sky and the earth,For the water, the Sun and the fireFor those who are sincere and seek peace in themselvesYou are the Mother, the truth,You are the playAnd You are God

For those whom by your light are rejoicedFor those who, though in war, have faith in your law and smileFor the sacred beauty, the freedom,For the signs of time, the joy that history has hiddenYou are the Mother, the truth,You are the playAnd You are God

Finally, for those by whom the world will soon be saved,For those who have chosen to love You, to adore YouYou are the life, the Kundalini, the Holy Ghost and the Adi Shakti"

Shri Mataji: Beautiful.[Conversation in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Very well done. How children spontaneously organise among themselves! [Laughter].You don’t have to teach them. They just pick it up and how they manage it.[Conversation in Hindi]
