[6:35]Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Thank you very much, thank you.

[Conversation in Hindi]

They can come here [on the stage]. It would be better. [Shri Mataji asked the musicians to come on the stage in Hindi]Would you like him to play tabla?Sahaja Yogis: Oh, yes. [Laughter, applause]Shri Mataji: Ah, what is this?Sahaja Yogi: This is the list of the children, who would like to get a name.This is the list of the children, but they are twenty years old.Shri Mataji: Ah. Today, we have to do it.Sahaja Yogi: Some of very same age but some are quite old.Shri Mataji: So, I can do it quick, otherwise,Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: And we can inform. Now we have so many children here. He has given me a big list of children.Sahaja Yogi: But some are very old children Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: They start from two months.Sahaja Yogi: Two weeks.Shri Mataji: Two weeks to seventeen.Sahaja Yogi: Twenty-one. I saw one of twenty-one Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: One is twenty-one. Yes![Laughter]All right. So, it’s a very big list and I’ll try to give them nice names.[Hindi]Please be seated, all of you. Please be seated

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, before starting his performance, we have a surprise for mister CP and Yourself.Shri Mataji: Oh.Sahaja Yogi: Because you are traveling both on each side of the world, and I heard that mister CP has not been in Pune for quite a long time. And we have sent our photograph reporter to Puna and he is getting a surprise for You. Christian!

Shri Mataji: You have already surprised me with so many things, now what’s that.[Christian gives a photo album]Thank you very much, thank you. Ah! That’s it!

The limit. Oh, I never knew. You are a surprise. [Hindi]Sir CP: For me it is a real surprise, I’ve not seen it before.Shri Mataji: Look at that. See the ‘makandu’ [unsure]![Hindi]Sahaja Yogi: Wandana just got her visa in time. Her pictures of Shri Mataji’s house being built in Puna.[Applause]Shri Mataji: This one is a real surprise, I tell you, because mister Shrivastava has not seen even the land. [Laughter]And he says, "When it will be all ready, everything fixed, I’ll just go with the key". [Laughter]Sir CP: When the creator is there, why should I worry.Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. He says, "When the creator is there, why should I worry". [Applause]

Sir CP: Thank you very much. That’s a very, very wonderful surprise from him. It’s first time I’m seeing my own house. [Laughter][Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Now what music?

Guido: I think Patrick has organised something. [Unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: We have a professional, Shri Mataji. So, I let Jean-Louis tell us the program for tonight.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi aside]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, let us start with a few songs written in French and dedicated to our Holy Mother.Shri Mataji: We can start, I think, first of all, we can start with Shri Adi Shankaracharya to begin with. And then we can start. Because that sets in the vibrations and everything well. It would be good.Guido: Adi Shankaracharya.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi about music]

All right. You arrange first of all, all the musicians to come this side [towards the left side of the stage] And- it’s all right, it’s all right. After all, we have so many musicians from so many countries.Sahaja Yogi: Every body wants to sing now.Shri Mataji: It’s all right, come along. You could move a little bit this side, some people [towards he right], so the musicians could all stand that side [left]. We have a huge choir I must say. Come along, come along.

Sahaja Yogi: Let’s have the musicians this side and the singers the other side. Please.[Shri Mataji is laughing because of the big mess]Gregoire: Shri Mataji, he is fantastic. [Name?] ask for an hour now.

Shri Mataji: Move on, move on. Let them move that side. Can you move this side? You are all musicians? All right, all right. Come along. Now I think some of you have to come that side. Most of them are musicians, you see, that’s the problem.Sahaja Yogi: The singers, on that side please.

Shri Mataji: I think some people can move this side, those who are not going to sing.Sahaja Yogi: Shh, please.Shri Mataji: There’s no- somebody has to arrange. Nick, can you arrange for their sitting? Some people who are sitting next to this side can move on that side, a little bit. Now, won’t you sit down? Just there, if you can move a little backword, all of you, a little bit. All of you move a little backward so that they can be seated. Let’s do this fast.[Arnaud is giving instructions in French so that people move backward]

Shri Mataji: Now, better be seated, I think. Better be seated. All right. Sit down, sit down.[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Nick, please, see there are some wires there and I don’t want the children to touch that. Next to that, yes please, as there are certain wires and things. Just tell somebody to look after that part.

This is Shankarcharya? Give them one [a sheet on which there are the lyrics of the song "Adi Giri Nandini" by Shri Adi Shankaracharya]. [Hindi]

Then, in this one, when he says, "I am Shiva, I am Shiva, I am Shiva", he is meaning that, "I am the Spirit. I’m not this body. I am not this intelligence. I am Shiva". Throughout it is like this that, "I am the Spirit". And as you know now, you all have become the Spirit.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.] [Sahaja Yogis sing an English version of this.]

May God bless you. Beautifully done, very good.[Applause]Guido: "Adi Giri Nandini", Adi Shankaracharya.Shri Mataji: Ganesha? Or you can, I think that "Nandini" one is good because that creates this [movement of Shri Mataji's hands meaning vibrations] then we can start with anything else, all right?

Where is Akbar, I don’t see him? Akbar? He comes? Oh.Sahaja Yogi: He has got his Italian passport but he’s not yet arrived.

Sahaja Yogi: He is following me Shri Mataji. [Laughter].

[Sahaja Yogis sing "Adi Giri Nandini", Sanskrit.]

[38:46]Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. It’s beautiful. It clears you out completely.

I think that you can sing some Hindi song that they can understand. For their sake, some Hindi song. One of those, once- I don’t know which one you could sing.Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]Shri Mataji: Which ever you sing proper, a Hindi song.[Conversation in Hindi.]

No, no, no, this one. Because we have had a fast one, so let’s have a little slow one now. Which page? What page it is?Sahaja Yogi: Page 2, Hindi songs.Shri Mataji: Page 2.These are, non, non, no. On page 2? Sorry, sorry. Ah, yes, it’s there.

[Conversation in Hindi.]

[Hindi bhajan]

[Conversation in Hindi.]

Shri Mataji: He is saying that it’s all my blessing that has made them so much congenial to Indian music. And [Applause]Now, which one you’ll sing?Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]Shri Mataji: Jogawa, tike? You see this is, [Shri Mataji explains in Hindi the meaning of this Marathi song, sung in the villages of Maharashtra.]

You don’t have ‘Jogawa’ with you?Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Mother.Shri Mataji: All of you?Sahaja Yogi: Children know Jogawa.Another Sahaja Yogi: The children know, learned it, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Children know it?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: That’s good! You all children know, good, good. That’s very good.You know by heart. Melania? Melania? Hello, Melania, you know this Jogawa? All right. Sit down, sit down, all of you should sing.Sahaja Yogi: They learned the song during the camp.Shri Mataji: Atcha.Sit down, sit down, sit down. Give a room. Give a room.Sahaja Yogi: Let the children sing.Shri Mataji: Non, no. I mean, you have to support them. Start it, all right. Let’s see.

Shri Mataji: This is the rhythm.

[Bhajan Jogawa, ancient version]

Shri Mataji: You already have got this Jogawa. You’ve got your Yoga, isn’t it? So, now you are asking it that means: what else?Sahaja Yogi: Deeper and deeper.Shri Mataji: Deeper and deeper. [Hindi]Now any one of your songs, we can have some French songs?What has happened to your piano?Sahaja Yogi: He is sleeping, full of vibrations.Shri Mataji: Full of vibrations.

Sahaja Yogi: The first song Shri Mataji, the name in French is, "Tu es la Mère" "You are the Mother"."For the one who goes ahead on your way,For the one who receives the love and the joy of the Divine,For the tree, that the rain grew up,For the day and the night which can in You be united,You are the Mother, the truth,You are the playAnd You are God

For the sky and the earth,For the water, the Sun and the fireFor those who are sincere and seek peace in themselvesYou are the Mother, the truth,You are the playAnd You are God

For those whom by your light are rejoicedFor those who, though in war, have faith in your law and smileFor the sacred beauty, the freedom,For the signs of time, the joy that history has hiddenYou are the Mother, the truth,You are the playAnd You are God

Finally, for those by whom the world will soon be saved,For those who have chosen to love You, to adore YouYou are the life, the Kundalini, the Holy Ghost and the Adi Shakti"

Shri Mataji: Beautiful.[Conversation in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Very well done. How children spontaneously organise among themselves! [Laughter].You don’t have to teach them. They just pick it up and how they manage it.[Conversation in Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: Let’s have Jericho. This one is in English.Shri Mataji: All right.

Shri Mataji: What’s a-Hello? What’s Jericho? Jericho is a –Sahaja Yogi: The battle of Jericho. The trumpets of Jericho. The trumpets were playing and all the walls fall down.Shri Mataji: Yes, so [inaudible]. It’s a place. Yes.Let them see for themselves.[Hindi]

This was a real, a real Martin ‘s song I think and all the negativity must have run away already from France. [Laughter][Hindi]Now with this, Nirmala is also a good song if you know that one, onward.All right. Let’s have the other one.

Patrick: A thousand glance.A thousand flashing glance flow the gladearound Nirmala Devi our MotherFrom Her loving eyes, the day will be reborn[Unclear] her children, time will be restored.

The Sun, the love and the wind will return.Lotuses will bloom again early May.In the entire world, all hearts will open.The days of the coming darkness will taste of honey.

Born on your loving and tendre breath,For ever, straight ahead,Our heart full of delight with TheeMataji Nirmala DeviTo win the battle, leading to eternity

The Sun, the love and the wind will return.Lotuses will bloom again early May.In the entire world, all hearts will open.The days of the coming darkness will taste of honey.[English translation is very different from the French song]

Shri Mataji: Now, which one you want to do?What has happened to the English?Sahaja Yogi: We have one song for Shri Ganesha.Shri Mataji: Shri Ganesha? That you sung in the morning.Sahaja Yogis: Another one. Different.Shri Mataji: Another one? All right, another one, let’s have of Shri Ganesha.[Conversation in Hindi]

[Musicians are leaving. Applause][Conversation in Hindi][Aside] Now, which one?French Sahaja Yogi: We have another one.Shri Mataji: Another? But I said, if you [switch] then it’s better.Now let the English come.Where are the English?French Sahaja Yogi: English are coming.Shri Mataji: It’s the Battle of Trafalgar! [Shri Mataji is laughing] Napoleon defeated! Napoleon was defeated by Nelson. [Shri Mataji is laughing]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Michel bought two bed covers [unsure].Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.[Conversation in Hindi]

Also, [Hindi].Come forward. Get him something to sit down. Come in, come in. Give him a chair or something to sit down. That’s a good idea.[Conversation in Hindi]

[Musicians sing:]Sumukha, EkadantaKapila, GajakarnakaGanesha, Ganesha, Ganesha, GaneshaJai, jai Shri GaneshaLambodar, VikataVighnanasha GanadhipGanesha, Ganesha, Ganesha, GaneshaJai, jai Shri GaneshaDhoomraketu, GanadhykshaBhalachandra, GajananahGanesha, Ganesha, Ganesha, GaneshaJai, jai Shri Ganesha[Sung for the first time here, this bhajan (Sanskrit 13) has changed with time]

Shri Mataji: Ah! This is good!Thank you very much for this new tune. But it is something, you can use it for POP music sometimes, you see. And we can, really! That’s the way you can popularize Sahaja Yoga. It’s quite in tune with that, I think. And as they don’t understand any meaning of it, they will think it’s some sort of a "ramba, ramba" going on. And it will have the effect of the mantra. It will be a very good idea, that’s a very good one, very good composition, that way. You must make something on POP style and in Sanskrit. So, it’s all right.[Laughter and applause][To Patrick] Hello? Yes, that’s how it could be. Tell them in French what I said.

Sahaja Yogi: Patrick, could you pass this to Shri Mataji, please?Shri Mataji: [In Hindi].Patrick: This song they are singing, Shri Mataji.Do you want a cup of tea?Shri Mataji: No. All right, if it is available.

[Musicians sing:]Across the Red sea You lead usto the promised land.With your love you feed usThe blessings from your hands.Oh, Mother, you know we want to be closer to youOnly you can show the wayAnd help us make it throughLeading us back to you.

Shri Mataji, inside we feel your touch.Shri Mataji, we love you so much.

And from the mountain you bring usYour sacred laws to teach.Within them you keep usTo keep us in your reach.May we stay inside the truthAnd please you every day.In our heart eternal youth and drive up is away.Listening to us,You say.

Shri Mataji, inside we feel your touch.Shri Mataji, we love you so much.

Jerusalem is where you take usAbove Sahasrara is your seat.When we sleep you wake usTo raise us to your feet

Every time you took your birth the children came to youEvery time upon the earth you taught the world anewYou are our one Guru.

Shri Mataji, inside we feel your touch.Shri Mataji, we love you so much.

Shri Mataji: Ah! Beautiful! How beautiful, very touching, hum?[Applause]

Sahaja Yogi: Just have, there’s one more song we would like to sing Mother, please.Shri Mataji: Yes, please, please. Then we’ll have the French and then we’ll have Italians.Sahaja Yogi: It’s on page 19, Shri Mataji. Page 19, Patrick.

[Musicians sing:]Holy Mother Durga, protecting us,May we sing this song for youMay be with loveFor you are Shri Chandika ever in our heartsPlease raise your children now the battle starts ...

Shri Mataji: Beautiful, very nice. Thank you, beautiful. Is there one more? All right, let’s have it. Yes, please.[Conversation in Hindi]

[A senior Sahaja Yogi sing a song, "Thy be the glory".]

Shri Mataji: Well done, well done. [Applause]Very well done, very well sung. So, we could have a French song.Patrick: Bill, with his nice law voice will read the translation.Shri Mataji: [Laughing]. All right.Bill: The song is called, "We thank you Shri Mataji".Mother, they are the breadMother, they are the sourceThey are the way and the goal of the courseWe thank Thee, Shri Mataji.For all this, we thank Thee.

Mother, they are the timeMother, they are the spaceThey are the moment and the season that go by.We thank Thee, Shri Mataji.For all this, we thank Thee.

Mother, they are the arisenMother, they are the lifeMother, they are the vibrations and the sweet harmonyWe thank Thee, Shri Mataji.For all this, we thank Thee.

Mother, they are the skyMother, there are the earthThey are the Sun and the whole universeWe thank Thee, Shri Mataji.For all this, we thank Thee.

Shri Mataji: Nice.My shoes should be there.[Musicians sing, some children too.]

[Applause]Shri Mataji: Ah, very beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you, wonderful! Beautiful song. It’s a beautiful little [unclear] there. There’s one hymn written on, about the same tune like, "Once to every man and nation, a moment comes to decide". It’s a beautiful song. I don’t know if you people have ever come across it, but it’s a very beautiful tune, same style. It’s very nice. It’s more Arabic [unclear] in it. Thank you very much. May God bless you.[Patrick translates into French].Shri Mataji: You have already done your decision.[Laughter, applause]Patrick: You already spoke this morning about the little tricks. But one of yours was to offer to France a nice painting last year, at the last Krishna Puja. And on this painting, it was instruments, music, papers and songs. So, it has been improving. Thank you, Mother.Shri Mataji: Oh, wonderful! French have come out on their own beauties, you see. You can see how beautifully they have arranged all the music and everything. It’s so beautiful! Thank you for this, really, thank you very much. Because without music, we can’t have Sahaja Yoga.

Patrick: The next song, Shri Mataji, we associated Armenia and Iran.Shri Mataji: All right, good. We must sing for them. May God give them sense.Patrick: I just mention to everybody, but as a very strange happening, the hotel we found for Shri Mataji is in Neauphle-le-Château. And Neauphle-le-Château is well known for another personality who is acting [Ayatollah Khomeini, Iranian fundamentalist who fled the Shah and took refuge in France]. And [unclear] love Mother with all the Deities are fighting what is wrong, you know, where it has been conceived. Jai Shri Mataji.

[Patrick reads the translation of the song:]Little start of live, twinkle in the nightFor my heart in Thy delightsShine upon our loveFor it to sew on and onKeeping life beautiful and carefreeShining stars shine whose sparkless in the skyPurest of flames, eternal fireYour love like a riverDrenches us with joy divineWhen the lights dwell upon the worldJai Shri Mataji Nirmala DeviGlory to Thee who has given us life.

[Musicians sing in Armenian and in French:The Armenian part of Bhajan:1 Siroon e eem myre [Beautiful is my Mother],2 Hamest e eem myre [dignified and modest is my Mother],3 Neman e anmeghe yeghnigee [She is like an innocent deer; in Middle Eastern literature, the deer is a symbol of innocence and tender beauty]4 Oozoom e inz bahel [She wants to take care of me],5 Oozoom e inz pergel [She wants to save me],6 Yev na siroom e Asdzov abrel [ And she loves to live with God],7 Aynkan em siroom Nirmala Myreen [I love so much Mother Nirmala),8 Garogh em haydnel bolorin [I can announce it to everyone],9 Aynkan em siroom yes eem mayreen [I love my mother so much]

Petite étoile de vieScintille dans la nuitCar pour toi mon coeur se réjouitBrille sur notre amour pour qu'il s'élève toujoursEt que la vie soit belle et sans soucis.Astre brillant, soleilTu brilles dans le cielD’une flamme pure, feu éternel.Ton amour comme l’ondeDivine joie nous inondeQuand ta lumière se pose sur le monde.Jai Shri Mataji Nirmala DeviGloire à toi qui nous a donné la vieJai Shri Mataji Nirmala DeviGloire à toi qui nous a donné l’Esprit.]

Shri Mataji: Today, we are all celebrating Holi, I think. [Shri Mataji is laughing]. Today, it’s his birthday. Plus, on this Holi, also we have brought the Holi day here for his birthday. It’s so joyous, so beautiful. And this is what he wanted. Shri Krishna wanted you to enjoy, every rhythm, every note, every beauty of the nature. May God bless you all.

Patrick: One more song?Shri Mataji: One more, all right. Last one.Sahaja Yogi: The last one?Shri Mataji: Yes.What about Italians? Are they satisfied?Sahaja Yogis: Italian!Shri Mataji: Italian? All right, one Italian and one French. All right, one Italian."Hame ma se pyar kitane" [Hindi,12] That’s a good one. That’s a small and nice one, they sing it very well."Hame ma se pyar kitane".Guido: All right.Shri Mataji: All right, be seated. All the children should sit down now. Please, be seated. They are singing a Hindi song to begin with.Sahaja Yogi: Would you like this song, Shri Mataji?Shri Mataji: Ah, this song. They sing very well. And then we’ll have, after this Hindi song, we’ll have an Italian song.Sahaja Yogini: Mother, would you like a fan [unsure]?Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.

Guido: Antonio?[Musicians sing.]

[Applause]

Shri Mataji: I hope you understand the meaning of this song, it’s very nice. Do you understand the meaning? All right. So, who can translate?Sahaja Yogi: Only the “refrain” [chorus] Shri Mataji, we know. It’s that: "I don't know how much our Mother loves us, but whatever I know is that we cannot live without Sahaja Yoga."Shri Mataji: That’s it. Further?Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know further.Sir CP: I think, you go beyond that.Shri Mataji: It’s very a nicely written song which says that, "Why don't you join all of us, in the great festival of 'nirananda'? Today, we are celebrating the great festival of 'nirananda' which is the 'ananda' of the Sahasrara. So, why don't you join us?" They are calling other people. "Why don't you join us for this festival of 'nirananda'?" It’s the joy of - absolute joy. Also, my name is ‘Nira’, as you know. So, it combines with the two.

All right, what else. Now, is there anyone more left from the French?Patrick: We are one more.Shri Mataji: All right, one more.Patrick: We have one which name is Kundalini.Shri Mataji: Kundalini. So, now what about the Italians? Must have a chance.

[Applause][Hindi]Guido: So, this is a song composed by a Sahaja Yogi from Milano, his name is Marco.Shri Mataji: Composed by whom?Guido: A Sahaja Yogi from Milano, Marco.[Applause]

So, You asked before for a POP music, that’s it.Shri Mataji: Yes, you must make some of that. That’s attractive in these days, in modern times, “samayachar” [according to time].Guido: I tried to make the translation."Jai, Jai, Shri Mataji Jai!In this world, nobody can bother me.Nobody can give me any problem anymore.You are existing only You for me.But a little of Maya is enough to create confusion in me. [Laughter]I know, with a foot-soak, it will go [Laughter]And then I will know how to raise a little bit more until tomorrow. [Laughter]You are still waiting since longBut you will see tomorrowWe will not have any more troubleAnd we will be all with You, higher and higher

But after that, so now I am in hurryI think about and I know what to doSo, I do a madka.[Shri Mataji is laughing very much]Shri Mataji: Now, that stage is over, I hope, for all of you.

Guido: But, that’s not enoughI will try to shoe-beat.[Shri Mataji is laughing very much]

Shri Mataji: You see, in America, there was one gentleman quite elderly. His son is a Sahaja Yogi, his wife, daughter-in-law- I mean, everybody is a Sahaja Yogi. He came and he said, "I must say one thing: the great secret". I said, "What is it?" "The shoe-beat is the greatest mantra". [Shri Mataji is laughing.] "Mother, who has told you?" I said, "Mohamed Sahib has told us that shoe-beating is the best to make the Satan run away". So, he said, "It’s a real mantra, I must say, because it has worked on all kinds of people". All right.Guido: So, we try to shoe-beat our Left Vishudhi.[Laugher] I’m sorry and I start perspiring.So now havan can wait.I surrender I don’t know what to do.Shri Mataji: Good!Guido: "Jai, Jai, Shri Mataji Jai!I surrender, I can’t help it anymore.Nothing better than go back and meditate".

Patrick: We make Guido translate it in FrenchShri Mataji: All right. You translate in French also, because you know French also.

[Guido translates in French up to Left Vishudhi][Shri Mataji is laughing very much]Shri Mataji: Really, it was so painful this morning.All right good. [Applause]

Patrick: This song, we should know by heart, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Yes. Patrick is saying: this song, we should know by heart. [Laughter]I mean, you are all out of it and you might have forgotten also many of those things, you see.Very simple methods, aren’t they?

Guido: Jai Shri Mataji!Shri Mataji: It’s such a humorous side of Sahaja Yoga!So, is there anymore, anyone wants to sing?Sahaja Yogi: Spain.Shri Mataji: Spain? Yes. Spanish, yes.

[Conversation in Hindi or in Marathi with Sir CP]Spanish, Latin American music.

You think they can come to the stage? I saw Antonio, call him to the stage. Better is, you see because – will you be able to manage it here?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: All right. Yes?

Guido: Mamata, Mamata. Amata.Shri Mataji: Who’s that?Ah, so many Spanish are here. I didn’t know so many Spanish have come.Patrick: Sorry.Shri Mataji: So many Spanish have come. Remarkable.[Conversation in Hindi or in Marathi with Sir CP]

[Shri Mataji reads the translation of the song]

[Musicians sing and play]

[Applause]Shri Mataji: Thank you very much! Thank you. Beautifully sung, I must say. What a rhythm! It’s a new rhythm of two bits, so beautifully done. I hope all of you learn these songs, you see. Spanish is easy to learn. French is difficult though.[Laughter][Shri Mataji opens both the hands]: French style. All right.So, I think everybody is satisfied. We can-Sahaja Yogis: French!Shri Mataji: All right. The last one will be by the French to thank you very much for coming over, for celebrating the birthday of Shri Krishna. [Shri Mataji looks at her watch]. He was born at twelve o’clock in the night.[Applause][Sahaja Yogis sing ‘happy birthday’]Shri Mataji: Well, thank you very much. Now, it’s surprising, we never celebrated the birthday on the day the child is born. But in India, that day is counted as one first birthday. So, like my age is now sixty-five years, because the first birthday is to be counted. So, it’s nice that people sing the song when the child is born. It’s a better idea, isn’t it? To greet the child.It’s in English, is it?

[Musicians sing in English]“You are Kundalini ... You are Shri Mataji....”

[The three great mantras]

Patrick: Shri Mataji, do you want to speak to the French on Monday night?Shri Mataji: All right. In Le Raincy.Patrick: 8 o’clock?Shri Mataji: About 7, 8.May God bless you.

Patrick: For those who are in Paris, Shri Mataji would like to speak to the French Sahaja Yogis who will be in Paris tomorrow night at 7 o’clock. So those who are still there can come, of course. So, don’t forget to get your Ganesha before leaving.Shri Mataji: What’s it? What is it?Patrick: I just remind them to get their Ganeshas.Shri Mataji: Can I?May God bless you all. Vibrations have increased instead of decreasing down.
