Diwali Puja. Sintra, Lisbon (Portugal) - 2 November 1997.

Today, we have gathered here to worship Shri Lakshmi.
In Diwali, in India, they worship Lakshmi because a great rakshasa called Narakasura was killed. Also that Lakshmi came out of the sea, at the same time, long time back. I mean, I should say, this is like Her different appearances on the same XXX. Lakshmi is the Goddess which gives us wealth, gives us prosperity. She is very blissful, no doubt. She gives you protection and also She is very humble because She stands on the lotus. She is very light, means doesn’t put Her pressure on anyone. These are symbols of Shri Lakshmi, but also She is a part of Mahamaya in the modern times. When people get Lakshmi, the money, they don’t understand that She is their Mother and She is to be respected. When this kind of perverse idea of Shri Lakshmi comes in such countries, such people meet their last end and destruction of the worst type. So this Lakshmi has to be used with a big balance, like standing on a lotus and not get into the pond, where there are all kinds of creatures to eat you all. You have to stand on the lotus, that means that you are above all the lures of this Maya. Also in Sanskrit languages, we call Lakshmi as the Maya. If somebody gets lot of money, they will say: "You got lot of Maya."
Now, this Maya plays the tricks. If money, prosperity was the salvation, then, there would have been no problem in this world because those people who have money always get ruined. If they are not ruined, their children, their grandchildren get ruined. This principle of Lakshmi within us is very dubious and the allurement is so much that people see somebody having a good car these days, they say: "Oh, what a man he is..." In any case, he’s not going to give you the car. If somebody is having lots of, what you can call, palaces or buildings, people start admiring! This is Kali Yuga. They start admiring: "See this man, he is so rich!" Even clothes: people see you wearing clothes which are very good tailored, might be from some designers, say. They think knowing of that man. For example in England, there is another befouling place called "Saville Row." So if you want to buy one suit, you have to pay sometimes 3000 pounds. Now, people are so stupid that now if they wear a suit from "Saville Row", they put the brand outside, "Saville Row." All such thorough foolery is going on all over the world. The clothes have no meaning, their life style has no meaning. Ultimately they end up in Swiss bank.
The Lakshmi Tattwa of Swiss bank is also now showing its teeth, and if you read what’s happening to them, I mean, they are shaking, they don’t know. They went to this limit that they took the teeth, golden teeth of the Jews! I mean, it’s going to far! All this thorough foolery has been going on. They have military services. Why? Who’s going to conquer that country? Even Napoleon didn’t do that. And they have made big caves to keep their weapons there. Who’s going to attack them? Stupid people... Suffering from ego. But the attack has come and this attack is so serious that they might be completely shattered and destroyed. Now, who falls for this kind of thing, you should see, are the people who are crooks, who are dishonest, who are absolutely adharmic. They can be Mafia, XXX or they can be some thugs, some black marketers, some smugglers. So, going against the Lakshmi principle, are so many done these days. One fellow who was thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, because he was trying to be very dominating and all that, he said: "That’s better." I said: "Why?" He’s doing now smuggling, making money out of smuggling and he has become very rich, according to him; but it comes to an end and a very tragic, bad end. Money is such a lure for human beings that it kills all sense of decency of higher values, everything. A brother, say, who is very nice and good fellow, if he gets money out of proportion by doing hanky-panky, he neglects his mother, father, brothers, sisters, everything. So I would say, then it comes to that point that Lakshmiji becomes a bhoot then and all Her blessings becomes a sort of a challenge to your dignity.
Now, certain countries, like America which is the area for Shri Krishna, because He is Kubera, they have no money as such. I’ve seen they are all poor, they are all indebted. So many Indians went to America and they can’t come to India now. "Why?" "We are indebted." "Why are you indebted?" "Oh, we get everything free, now, you see, the bank gives us loan, we can have the best life style." So they will have three Mercedes. Is nothing! "Three Mercedes is nothing. You should have Rolls Royce’s, we should have this." "For what? What do you get out of it?" Now of course, little bit they are shaken out with the stock exchange and all that nonsense they have started, all these jokes and all these very big kind of loggerheads. All now are coming out. So, this is no Lakshmi, because Lakshmi must give you dignity, prosperity and respect. I think Americans understood about it, so they become philanthropist, means they are giving money to people. To whom did they give money? All the names these people took from South Africa were all the money given by the philanthropist of America. What has happened to their wisdom? That 16-year old boy, he went there and then all ages went there and made a very big money. All this money making proposition... So what is the matter if there is a blessing of Lakshmi? Why a man who gets the blessing of Lakshmi becomes so funny, so stupid and ultimately ends up his life that people are not there even to pick up his dead body?
What is the difference between money and Lakshmi? She gives you money, alright, agreed, but when She is giving the money, what happens to that money which comes to you? It’s a very subtle thing one should understand. In India if you give 100 rupees to a servant, immediately he’ll go to drink somewhere. First, idea will come, what he should do, he’ll go for a drink. Of the hard one, I mean; your moorka is nowhere near that, such hard one they make in India, you know. It is called as Hatbhatti, made with hands. So in 100 rupees, they are willing to go. I mean, that means any money you give to them, it spoils their life completely. Lakshmi has been given, alright, so what happen to this Lakshmi? She changes Her form and Her form is so bad that you are completely ruined with that.
So, now we have to understand what is the way we can use the Lakshmi. Supposing I get money, supposing. Then I will go to the market, say, and I’ll see something nice: "Ahh! This is very good for this Sahaja Yogi." Or I will say: "This will be very handy for our ashram." Immediately the mind starts working in a very socialistic way, I should say. Not individualistic. For example, I went to Rajasthan and I saw such a lot of sand, just like a big desert, big dunes, everything. And people starving. So I said: "How to get money to these people?" So, I said: "Let Me start a factory, factory with the unbreakable glass, which they make only in France." They make it very cheap and regarded as a very cheap thing, not in India. In India, if you go to some elite’s house, they’ll offer you tea in these unbreakable things, they think it’s very elite, you know, it depends on what you think about. And very proud of it. So, I said, if you make these things in India, these poor people, you know, because there is so much sand and sand is needed by trucks, so I will utilise this to make this beautiful factory here and then give them some support to live well.
Now, when I went to one place called Warana. You all had come also once. There’s a gentleman who was a disciple of Gandhiji and he has organised this Warana company for distributing milk. It became so very rich, so very rich, it’s a co-operative, so he started giving money to all the co-operative people, those who were labour there. Now, this labour had never seen that money, so he came to Me, touched My feet and said: "Mother, You tell me now, what should I do: I’m so unhappy with the development of this Warana, because there are prostitutes who arrived from Bombay, there are all kinds of hard deals which have come from Bombay and these people are smoking like hell, they are taking drugs..." "Hey?" "Yes! Wherever there is money, the drug goes there and the children are becoming absolutely useless, they don’t want to study, they even slap their parents." So he said: "This was not Gandhiji’s ideal, now what has happened?" He says: "This is a curse of money." And he was crying.
Now, how can Lakshmi become a curse? It does! It is in the Nabhi. What a central position it has and when this Nabhi starts working, it is a very remarkable thing that you feel gobbling the food all the time with this Nabhi. You go on eating, go on eating like mad and then some bhoot comes in to eat also with you inside the Nabhi. Then you can eat so much that no human beings can eat like that, except for the people who are rich. Then you start a big science or what you can call etiquette. I don’t want to hurt anybody, I mean, if you are eating well I don’t mind, eat well. But the fuss part is, because today is Diwali, I’m trying to tell you all these interesting stories.
I went many times for dinner with French diplomats. My goodness!! Now, Me and My husband don’t drink, so forty five minutes they were only discussing what they will have today. Then they remember, yesterday they had that, the day before, they had that, so there should be variety. So, then they came down to something, not all of them drinking the same, different, different. So, they came to some point: "Alright, we’ll have this." But some people asked for something which was not available. So they said: "You have to have it!" And they shouted at them. My goodness! They took forty five minutes to decide what they are going to eat. It’s regarded as French etiquette, I think, and we took chief guest Myself and My husband. Looking at this man and looking at that woman, did not know what to do with those etiquette. We were thinking, now better go.
Then came to food. They are so particular: "I like this and I like that." They are worst than Indians, I think, and they took at least, at least eighty minutes to decide what they will eat. Ultimately, they found something nice, each different and the restaurant people were trying to pamper their ego: "Oh, what a thing you have chosen, this is the....Wah, wah, wah..." So they started serving. The cheese was smelling so awful, I tell you. We couldn’t bare it, you know, both of us, so My husband told them: "Today is our fasting day for both of us." He said: "Why is it a fasting day?" He says: "In India, we have, you know, fasting like this, sometimes we have to fast; today is our..." But I told him: "Here, one day you are saying today is our fasting, but we have to go to so many dinners, what will you do?" He says: "Everywhere, better to say that we are fasting." Such a horrible cheese they brought and they started boasting that they have 200 types of cheese, 200 types of the smelly ones. "From where did you get?" They said: "This is French perfection!" I said: "What is this French perfection?" But then, you know, tears came into My eyes. C.P. said: "Why are you crying?" "Not crying, but I think what will happen to these people with their cheese, where will they go? Even if they go to hell, people will throw them away with the smell of the cheese."
Then I read how this cheese came in. So they said that there was a big snow fall and they had put some big, big containers in a cave of milk and people forgot about it. Snow fall was there for 20 days, whatever it was, and they just forgot about it. So, after one year, they got the smell, you see, coming out of it; so they went and saw the cheese being formed, can you imagine? This is the beginning of the hell. Actually, one should never eat anything that is kept overnight, normally. But now they have got fridge, so you can keep it for 2 days, 3 days at the most. Like on the ship they keep it. But this I couldn’t understand that this cheese which they told Me is very old. I said: "Really?" And they sell it by that, what old it is. And their wines, if they are, say, 200 years old it is 200 times more expensive. So, it’s such a bhootish thing to eat all that. So, when the Lakshmi goes into the hands of bhoots on a very less level, I should say, these days, then it goes into the heads of people who want to exploit money, exploit poor people, exploit countries which are downtrodden, go on like this, collecting money, you know, looting, looting, looting.
When English came to India, we did know, they used to take brides. On Diwali day if you went there without any present they say: "Oh, baksheesh, you must give some presents." And what they liked was our country liqueur, I never knew this, but later on I came to know because My husband became a collector of XXX and there where bottles of country liqueurs kept in that house, with that house was itself more than hundred year old. Long time back it was kept but still, some of them, you see and we could have sent them to England to sell, I mean, it would have been a good idea. So, the older it is, it’s better. This Lakshmi I think becomes old and dies and there is alakshmi. Alakshmi means when you have money and you don’t have the qualities of a person who should have money. In that quality of Alakshmi, you become very miserly, you don’t want even to help your brothers and sisters, you don’t want to give any money to anyone and even if you give it, you give it to false gurus and wrong things. This is up to, we can say, is Alakshmi.
The behaviour becomes very arrogant, so arrogant that you behave like horses you know, people look like horses: they walk like horses, but I don’t know if horses have ego. If you see these people, you just don’t understand what has gone wrong with them. There is one gentleman who started an aeroplane business, aeroplane business in India. I won’t take his name but say some Majidya or something like that and my granddaughter met him with my grandson-in-law and they were walking like this, talking like this, you see, they can’t understand these two persons; so, they came and talk to them who you are and all that and then they said: "We are this Majidya." So, my granddaughter said: "Who is Majidya?" "My goodness!", they fell from heavens, "You don’t know who are Majidyas, do you read newspapers or not?" Then her husband came in, he said: "I do." "Now what do you want to say? We are Majidyas!" He said: "Who are Majidyas?" "You don’t know? What sort of business you do, what is this..." Such stupid things they did that these children felt that there is no use having any business; if business means this kind of behaviour, very indecent, very arrogant, they don’t know how to relate to people, they don’t know! And after some time, I heard that their business was completely finished, was a flop, they call it a flop.
So now, we have to realise that this Lakshmi, how it takes us to wrong things. Firstly, She makes you very egoistical. Somehow, if a man has money, he starts behaving like that. One cannot understand how a person who was normal, suddenly becomes like this, starts talking like this. He might earn money, even, in the horse races.
Around the Lakshmi is the valence of Dharma. There is around the Lakshmi, is the Dharma and this Dharma if you cross, that’s the best place where they can cross the Dharma. Then, you can do whatever you like. This adharmi which is irreligious, which is hideous, you have to just cross that limit of that Dharma. We have to just deviate from Dharma.
Now, as I said many a times that ten valences human beings have got, but apart from that, there are many Dharmas which are surrounding everything, like angels. Like first Dharma is your love for humanity, is the first Dharma but if you say from that end when you start, it starts with 3 Dharmas, is the Dharma of the woman, how she should live, how she should get married, how she should look after her children, what should be her behaviour, all is three Dharmas. And then is Patni Dharma, is the wife, wife Dharma, what should be her Dharma. In her Dharma she looks nice. If she gives up her Dharma then she is a prostitute.
So, then is Pati Dharma: how should be a husband, how he should behave towards his family, how should he pay attention towards his wife, about the whole entire family, the whole, you can say parivar, as they call it, all the relations. That is his Dharma but beyond that is the Dharma of Satya Dharma: how much he sticks to truth, then the Dharma for creativity. In creativity as you know very well these days, with money people are standing on their heads or I don’t know what they are doing because the amount of nonsense they are producing all over the world in the name of modernism is no way is Kala Dharma, no way.
Then we have also politics, Rajkaran Dharma. This also Dharma is there, now taking bribes, I mean the kind of things that are going on, corruption, all kinds of things that are going on, competition, fighting and all that. They are falling from their Dharma of Rajkaran. Education, same thing; we call it Shiksha Dharma.
All such things are Dharmas; there is a kind of a principle which we have to keep, otherwise you can topple down from the lotus and that’s what happens. Now we have also Rashtra Dharma. The Rashtra Dharma is that your country, there is a Dharma of your Rashtra. When you have to fight for your country, you should, but you should not be aggressive on other countries, it’s not right to dominate other countries nor you should bring bad name to your country.
It’s very important! Sahaja Yogis have all this intact, absolutely, because you are standing on the lotuses already. You don’t have this problem, normally no. Once in a while there are people who behave like that but mostly Sahaja yogis don’t fall into these traps, that’s why their Lakshmi Tattwa will definitely improve. They’ll have little problems here and there but without problems if you get Lakshmi, you will not value for it. So, with little problems, you get the Lakshmi. But Lakshmi doesn’t give you all this imbalance. Such a man has to be extremely balanced because beyond that is the step of Mahalakshmi where your seeking starts, where you become a seeker. You go beyond Lakshmi principle and this Mahalakshmi principle starts coming into it.
I would say the Western countries this consumerism has started and it’s such a funny one. In America, one lady was married to an Indian and he used to tell Me how this consumerism works. I said: "How?" He said: "I gave my wife money to buy two shirts for me because I had no shirts. So, she went and bought five skirts. So, I said: "You have so many skirts, why did you buy the skirts?" "Because in this money I could buy five skirts instead of two shirts, so I bought five skirts." So he said: "I can’t wear skirts!" "So, how I should correct her?" he said. I said: "You do one thing, tell her you want to buy some skirts for her and go and buy five shirts, then she will realise that if the money was given to her for one purpose should be used for that."
This is a very subtle principle which I follow because I don’t understand money. So, what I do, whatever money I get I put packets: this is for this, this is for this, this is for this, into packets. But I don’t understand, you know and I don’t write accounts. I’m very bad about all that. Somebody else does that. Now, if I spend some money from one pocket for some emergency, then I again fill it back, it’s written there: so much is there, so much is there. So, the money is available at the right time for whatever I want to do and the money is in the packet. It is not in sort of an open thing that I can just want to buy a Mercedes, I want to buy a Rolls Royce, no nothing doing, it is for something, some purpose and there is no need. So, when you go to the shop and you see something, you won’t buy because that money is not kept for that particular thing. For Sahaja Yogis it is very easy to handle their money with respect. So, you go to any shop, you won’t buy anything.

But My nature also is spontaneous. So, I went to Frankfurt, changing. They said: "Mother, there is a very nice watch shop." I just thought I’m going to get three son-in-laws and what am I going to give them? So, I went to that shop and I found such beautiful, beautiful things but I have not kept any money for the watch, but I said I must buy. One of the watches turned out to be a very unique one, I must tell you, which is no more available. Because of My eyes, I saw this something unique and My son-in-law is so... I mean, over wealth, so... quite rich, he has no problems, but he said: "This watch you cannot get it." Then an article came about that particular watch. So he has kept it with him. You see, have something that it should have a value behind it. That is the Dharma part. Value behind it; what is the value? When you want to buy something just don’t buy because you are mad, I mean instead of shirts you buy skirts, not that way. But anything that has an artistic value or some special value, then you should buy that.
Now this sari I’m wearing, it has a special value. Why? Not that it is made with hands is a very beautiful design it has, no. This was made in place called Paithan which was the capital of a kingdom which belongs to My forefathers: Shalivanas and these saris were made there, Paithan and they used to sell it to people. Now they have becoming expensive, in those days they were cheaper. Now, it has that value; they are very honest, very religious, they are called Shalivanas because they used to give shawls to the Goddess. They spread their kingdom very much and also there is a calendar in their name but the kind of life they led: they were just very generous people and they have made beautiful temples, beautiful places for people to rest near the river. I mean, so many beautiful things they have done. Apart from that Rama and Sita, when they went to Dandakaranya, they went to this place and you have the place where Sita took Her bath, Her bathing place. There is a little river flowing there. How it was covered from all the side and how the light was coming, so beautiful. But whatever Rama had done they redecorated it with the Rajput style. Then also there was a very beautiful temple, I saw that they have made. Also, I don’t know how, there was some water flowing and there was Shri Mahadeva, a big thing Pinda and also there was a Parvati statue. So old as that, I don’t know if it was put by Rama or by My own, you can call them great, great, great grandfathers, but the beauty about that place that it shows that Sita used to worship Mahadeva. The water was flowing, somehow by nature inside, up there in a stream and She used to take the water and put it on that pond. How deep these people were; those who built that temple, such a beautiful temple they have made. You see, so many temples are built like this in India by people who had money and they believed that if you spend your money in this kind of work, you are blessed.

I bought a land, near the river Nira; that’s My own name: Nira and this land I just bought it just like that without thinking and what they told that their guru, Shalivanas guru was Shandilya and this place belonged to him long time back which was an ashram of Shandilya, exactly the same. And that land I bought, very surprisingly. Then in the newspaper, it came out everything about that land and this land was the place where a great devotee of Shri Vishnu: Pralada was playing. You must have heard about Pralad. His mother had a husband, long time, Hiranyakashapur was her husband, horrible rakshasa, so she ran away from there and who help her was Indra. He brought this lady to the place of guru Shandilya and Shandilya told him, Indra, that: "You don’t put any effort for her, I’ll look after her. And the child that is going to be born to this lady is going to get the avatar of Narasimha." You know Narasimha is the man and the lion. He said: "How can that be?" He said: "It is so." So Indra left her there. The child was born. Till five years that child used to play in that land which I bought. But I didn’t know about it. I just saw it; I was surprised. But when the child grew up, up to five years he had to go back to his father. I don’t know how many of you read about Pralada? Raise your hand, I would like to know, let me see...who was killed and I mean his father was trying to kill him and torture him but he had certain boons. So Shri Vishnu appeared as Narasimha, means the lion and the human form. And then He killed this Hiranyakashapur, the father.

Now, imagine how much it was that thousands years back, this must have happened and I should purchase that land and there is a very good temple built about 300 years back by Maharashtrians. So, the story is that Pralada came into the dream of the people who wanted to built the temple and told them that: "I already made a statue of Narasimha along the river Nira." Imagine the name of the river is also mine. "And if you can walk along the banks of Nira river very close to the temple, I’ve made the statue in sand." "It’s a miracle!" So, they went there and they saw that statue. They brought it back and installed it in that temple. And it is still there, made of sand. Also they say there’s a kind of a river or a water flow, very small one, just like the finger flows down from the top, God knows how. So, now see the value, the value of money which was collected to built this temple had such an old value. So, the value is not money. This, one should understand what is the value of the thing you want to give something to others, then the feelings you have in your heart is the value and that value is the real Lakshmi. When you are, say, building a house, the plans you make, the things you do, what is the idea behind and what you are trying to express through that house is the value of that house.
Once you understand that, you have to buy with this Lakshmi or you have to use this Lakshmi for certain value and not for showing off or for money. This superficialness that we have about money itself is like an ordinary glass. But if you put behind the glass the mercury you can see the value. So, when you start buying something, what is the purpose? Why are you buying? This will determine the value. Like the last time I came to Portugal and I said we’ll go and buy some terra-cotta. But they are very expensive. I said this is the price, but I wanted to buy terra-cotta from Portugal because it’s very rigid. So, we went to one factory and the factory was quite far away. None of them could find out, but I told them: "It’s here only, just go and see!" And then we bought the terra-cotta. But on our way, I told: "Stop, stop here, stop!" So, they stopped; there was a shop. I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis in India and also for some people in Cabella. And that shop had such beautiful cottons. There were some Sahaja Yogis from here who saw that. Such beautiful clothes. I bought a lot of it. I said: "Thank God, the problem presents are finished now for India." So joy giving it was. Everybody was surprised: "Why suddenly in a place where never have been Mother there, suddenly She finds?" It has a value because I wanted to buy some things for Indians to be given as presents. So, if a Lakshmi is say, this much, once you add to it a value it becomes so.
The sign of a person who is Lakshmi Pati is this: he should have a house like a lotus in the hands of the Goddess, he should protect people who are depending on him and from the left hand, he should give. This is the image of the Lakshmi. This is what the Lakshmi is within you. If you have this four things in balance without conditioning, without ego, then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise, you are not. On a Diwali day, you have to promise ourselves that whatever we are going to get now, as Lakshmi principle or as a Lakshmi’s prasad, should be used in getting things which has value and thus you will learn that you have used your Lakshmi very well and with that, your Mahalakshmi principle will become very strong; you’ll become very strong by which you will ascend very fast.

Today is the day for us to celebrate the Lakshmi Puja but Lakshmi Puja doesn’t mean that you worship money. Money as it is, is the most dangerous thing and I think it is the hidden weapon of Lakshmi Devi. See, if you try to misuse Her, She goes on punching you. With one punch, if you don’t realise then She gives you another punch. Like that, then She might little bit twist you to suggest. She’ll try everything to convince you that what you are doing is nonsense. Ultimately, She sees your destruction completely. So, Lakshmi, though She is the One who is the giver of boons, giver of everything, you should not be mislead by Her Mahamaya character. I’m your Mother, so I better tell you to be very careful!

Thank you very much
