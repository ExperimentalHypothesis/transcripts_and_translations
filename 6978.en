Talk on Kabir. Aurangabad (India), 18 December 1987 after a concert. India tour

Aah, on your behalf, I would like to thank the artist, the lady Mrs Asha Devi and Mr. Nath Niralkar. See, his name is Nath and you know what Nath means. And it seems as if the Naths themselves were singing today and I felt it in himself and in his songs. And the lady who sang so well with such understanding of the music, herself is a PhD. She has got doctorate in music. Both of them, I don’t know how to say, but sort of excited our Kundalinis and made us feel the beauty of this divine music. I’ve always felt and now I feel much more, that Indian music comes from complete Divinity. Because even if you don’t understand the different ragas, how you are enjoying it. He said, in the last Bhajan of Kabira, he said, “listening and listening to this, I just got lost into it. Without thinking, without knowing about the different ragas, but just I got lost in the thoughtless awareness, in the Nirvichar Samadhi”.
Then he says that, “I got my Samadhi, at the lotus feet of my guru”. And the second point he said is very good, that, “at the essence of the Omkara, essence of Aum Omkara kara, I made a little string and I crossed the Hamsa Chakra and crossed the ocean of illusion”. And the third one is even much more explicit, that, “the Sahasrara, the Brahma-Randhra, where the fontanel bone is, just opened out, and the joy started pouring, like a frill over my head, and I got lost into it”. I mean, what a description, a beautiful description, of Kabira he did.
And before that, the one he sang, the song was about how Kabira has made fun of human beings who are so much attached to things and to their relationships and to other possessions of life. So he says that, “there is cheat a thug or a cheat, who has taken away, has looted everything from me, that is death.” So this fellow, who was so much attached to everything is now saying that, “it has taken away everything that I had, and this is the time when the Yama, you know Yama- he is sitting on my bed. And here I am crying and my eyes are filled with tears.” I mean, such a situation is there and then he doesn’t know how to give up things, and he says that, ultimately he reaches a point where he says that, [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi...] and then he said ultimately that “now my relationship at this death time is all these identification, misidentifications have dropped out. So why to wait for the death, you see? Why not to get it done now with your realization?” This is the point he was trying to make, and so beautifully sung and so lilting and so touching, and I am really thankful to Mr. Niralkar that he has brought out that beauty of Kabira’s saying, in his voice. May God bless both of them and let them prosper in their music and I hope very soon they should become very great personalities of music. May God bless them all.
Clapping
Very graciously they have agreed to give you another musical recital at about five o’clock tomorrow, five to seven, and then you can proceed to Rahuri. It’s very kind of them to have. They have one thing very great about them. I have seen the artists in India or anywhere have a kind of a terrible ego. But they are so humble, shows that they have got the knowledge within them. And they have got the full appreciation of themselves that they can render this entertainment with such proficiency. Now luckily, tomorrow you will again have a chance to hear them, and give them a hand and thank them very much for what they have done.
