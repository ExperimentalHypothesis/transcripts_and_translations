Talk to Sahaja Yogis. Moscow (Russia), 24 August 1991

Galyna: There three steps. Three dimensions.

These are three steps of ascent to Sahasrara.

Shri Mataji: ...is still ....with the first one.

Galyna: But it was Agnya.

Shri Mataji: This is Vishuddhi?

Galyna: Ah, Vishuddhi, yes.

Sahaja Yogini: Void.

Shri Mataji: Nabhi.

Beautiful.

Galyna: Perhaps, this could be also three coils.

Shri Mataji: Yes.
