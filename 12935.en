Talk to Sahaja Yogis, 5th August 1992, Ashram in Niittykumpu, Espoo, Finland
You are becoming [sounds like: kids?], I don't know why. The getting your presents was the problem. Sorry for late. We are searching your presents.

Beautiful place you have! Sorry we took so much time. We were busy locating your presents.

...

It is your duty to look after them. The programs should be such, that you should work them out inside Helsinki, as well as you should go out into smaller cities. And one thing is very important, how you [deal/leave?] with the group. It's very important. You must get rid of your ego, first of all. And in Sahaja yoga you should never say, "You are a bhoot", or things like that. Or, "You are possessed." Just talk on chakras. That chakra is caught, that chakra is caught.

Also you should cleanse yourself at home. And also in the collectivity. All the ladies, specially, must know everything about Sahaja yoga. Men know everything, but women are the... They are more emotional. You must know each and everything. Which chakra is where, on the feet where they are, on the body where they are, inside where they are. What are they, everything. So you could have a course like that.

You will have to be very gentle, compassionate, and not to say things that will hurt them. That will really make them feel that these are different people. Moreover, sahaja yogis should never contradict among themselves. But when it comes to argument, better not have it with others. But somebody is aggressive, then you all should join together. Do not support the other one, because he is negative. Support your leader, always. Support the leader. If I find anything wrong with the leader, I'll remove him. But you don't fight with your leader. [Sounds like: stackily?] you have a very good leader, I would say. Any problems, anything, you can always write to me.

And you should try to cure people, but don't touch them, use the photograph. You can give balance, you can give chakras bandhans, but don't touch them. The most important thing is taking a bandhan. Very important. Before going out of the house, before sleeping, before addressing the people. Or treating someone. When you are treating somebody, take yourself a bandhan, give that person a bandhan, and then do it. That will help you.

Now for example, if her sisters are doing like that (the yogi who is translating says that they are going to a wrong guru, ed.), you take her name, and give her a bandhan. It will work out. You have one sister only?

Yogi: Two sisters.

Shri Mataji: Instead of arguing, let's just to give bandhan.

Now, there are some little presents I could manage to bring. [Was?] traveling of six countries all around and just sharing five [pieces?]. I've been able to save some things.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is all too much...

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. It's is a just I... just little small.

...

Shri Mataji (getting a present, ed.): Thank you very much.

Yogi: And then, Shri Mataji, Thou said in Kundalini Puja, when we were giving that silver kumbha as the puja present, and there was a duck. Thou said that, "In Finland there are lot of ducks, and even the ducks could not have that much discrimination." After this, we have got this much discrimination that we are willing to give Thou... (Yogi giving a figurine of swan to Shri Mataji. Ed.) Here are You!

Shri Mataji: You have swans!

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You ['ll?] have the maximum number of swans. So the [nishang?? - detached way of life, ed.] should be much more. The swans are known. ['s say?] There is a couplet in Sanskrit.

Beautiful! (Shri Mataji is looking at the figurine. Ed.) What a balance. What a balance. And there is a couplet. Very good. "Hansa ha kshkad ha, bakha ha kshkad ha." In Sanskrit. "Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka ha. Ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho." The... what is that bird which... which stands on one foot?

Yogi: It's "haikara". (A finnish word for "stork". Ed.)

Shri Mataji: So the stork is white and the swan is also white. What is the difference between the swan?

Hansa. Hansa is... is swans. Hansa. The Hamsa chakra. Hansa are swans. And bakaha are the stork. But I can't remember the name. It's other. (That bird's name is "crane", according to the Hamsa puja talk, 1988. Ed.)

So they are all white. But what is the difference between them? The difference is: "Needa ksheeram bhedu." If you put water and milk together, the swan will just take the milk. When the discretion between the water and the milk is to be done, then "Hansa ha hansa, ha baka habka." Then hansa remains hansa, "baka ri baka". When it is the discretion between water and milk.

That's why it's swan. Swan is in India respected very much. Because it is divine bird. It has discretion. It can separate the water from milk. And that's why I told him that, "It was fine discretion. You should look at Finland!" (Shri Mataji had said that probably to some other yogi before. Ed.)

Yogi: What is..?

Shri Mataji: You should look at Finland for divine discretion. It's a Hamsa chakra in it. It's a Hamsa chakra. ... Aa!

Yogi: What?

Shri Mataji: It's a Hamsa chakra. [Ida naa?]

Yogi: You know, I thought this is Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Ha? No, no, no, no, no. Agnya is only in Russia and China. But this is Hamsa chakra.

(A yogini is bringing something to Shri Mataji. Ed.)

Marion, you got something [to me?]? Oh...!
