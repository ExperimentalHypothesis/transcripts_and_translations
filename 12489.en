It seems that this rain is just as moody as us.   So we went to the Nagar district, and we met a Sahaja yogi there, in Girgone, he said ‘Mataji’, by your grace everything is fine, but there has been no rain at all in this area.   So I said, OK, it will rain, he said, when? so I said  if you want it to happen today, it will rain today.   After that there was a big program in Nagar that night, and as I started the lecture, it started to rain very heavily.  The rain  is actually worse today, that  means it is really testing you.   I am really pleased to see that despite the rain so many people have come to the program in Dadar.   This is a real test.  In old days, The Gurus used to test you in so many different ways.   Even today I see that the Gurus have different ways of testing you compared to the Mother.   They will make you wash all the pots and pans, make you do all kinds of service, they will test you in a big way, then in the end if you pass all the tests, then only he will give you something.

But the rain has really tested you today, one good thing about the rain is that, until the rain stops, you people are not going to leave (Shri Mataji is laughing).   Sahaja Yoga is kind of an enjoyment (fun).   Anyway, what I want to say is, that, Sahaja Yoga is a play for me, so there is no need to be so serious.   It’s a play, it is a game.   For those who can manage it, it is a game for them.  For those who can not manage it, they find it a little difficult.   It made me very happy that, these little children played an instrument.  ..........  !  This knowledge which has been given by big Sadhus and Saints, in this land of India, the knowledge about music, which is good for the soul, which today's young people are following, it is a very great thing,  they have to be encouraged for that.   And when they will gradually  become experts, then playing an instruments will also become a play for them.   So they should be praised (admired), and in the same way I also admire (appreciate) you people.

This is only the  beginning of Sahaja Yoga,  once it settles (comes together), then it becomes very interesting, it becomes a play.   Just now Mr Chawhan was telling us about it, that there are many Sahaja Yogis who has gain mastery over it, they have become experts.   I myself am surprised to see how skilled they are.   I tried to test them a few times to see if that is really true (if they have really become true Sahaja Yogis), but they really have gone so deep in to Sahaja Yoga.

Today's subject, the Kundalini and Vishnushakti, and also The Bramhashakti, they have put this huge subject in front of me.   You will need seven days just to explain about the Kundalini.   To talk about Bramhashakti, will also need seven days, and it will need seven days for Vishnushakti also, so if you arrange the program for 21 days, then I will be able to tell you about all these subjects in detail.   But I should be able to talk about the basics of it.   So today, not much could be done, apart from only mentioning about these three subjects.   Even then, if you listen to the subject matter carefully, then you will be able to understand it.

Even when I am talking, my attention is on your Kundalini, so you should put your hands towards me, that is the main thing.   All my lectures and everything becomes meaningful, only when you get your self realization, otherwise it has no meaning.   Put your hands out like this, if you are wearing shoes, better take them off, if you are wearing anything black round your neck, also take it off, some people might be wearing thread round their waist, then better take it off.   Specially in Villages these things are very common, but even here if you have anything like that, better to remove it.  In the Villages, as soon as mention it, all the things get piled up.

Yesterday, I told you a little bit about the desire of God or his power of desire, which flows through our left channel, the Ida nadi.   The Kundalini is the small part of this power of desire.  That means, God has placed our desire itself in this triangular bone within us.   The only difference is that, this thing, which has just being born, very new, who is married, but because it is being the power of god we can call it only symbiotically being married, so this newly married, the Kundalini, who is still completely pure, is sitting in the triangular bone.   This is the power, which is left over after the formation of the fetus, that is why it is called residual energy in English.   But this is the pure power, is the pure desire of God.   Because it is completely the pure desire of God and there is no influence of our human desires on Gods desire, so it is completely pure.   She is sitting there in her purest form, means it is only the desire of God.

This triangular power, which looks triangular from outside, but inside is a three and a half coils, is sitting inside us.  Now, it is mathematical to why three and a half coils, but I am only going to make  a mention about these things, then afterwords you can read the books written about it.   We also have a book in English, it will be good if you could read that.   Now this power (energy), like we can see inside the seed there is an energy to be  sprouted, that sprouting energy has been taken and placed in to the triangular bone.   Now when we start using the power of desire, which flows from the Ida nadi, so to fulfill the desire we need to do the action, if you only desire and do not act on it, then you can not really put that desire in to a picture.   The desire has to be turned in to an action, and for that reason the power of action has come in to being.   That power of action is on our right side.   Which flows through the Pingala Nadi on our right side.

Yesterday I was telling you that the point where these two powers meet, that is where Ganesha is placed.   The power of desire is full of emotions, we are not able to see the desires of man, it is invisible, when the desire takes form,  then only we can see it.   But it can only take form because of the power of action.   So when the power of action comes from left side  to the right side, in Sahaja Yoga we call it the power of ‘Mahasaraswati’.   First one is called The power of ‘Mahakali’ and the second one is called the power of ‘Mahasaraswati’.   There are so much vibrations today, that I am not even able to speak.   The Power of Mahasaraswati which is flowing though our right side, the Pingala Nadi, that is the Bramhashakti.   When this Bramhashakti get activated, when Brahma’s  power of action start to work, and the deity there is the Bramhadeva.   That means Mahasaraswati helps Brahma’s power of action.   When this power is flowing through, then Brahma comes in to an action.

Now, whatever we read in the Vedas (scriptures) is written only about Bramhashakti.   It is surprising that, we only think about one of the aspect.   When a human came in to being, he also  had a desire to act, he already had the power of desire in him, but he developed the desire to act.   To be able to act on his desires he had to first face the five great elements (Ether,Air, Fire, Water, Earth).   So how these five elements entered in us, and their five essences, also before that the Mahatahankara, like these there are 24 qualities (attribute, virtues), out of all these powers, these 24 qualities manifested, and because of that these five elements came in to being.  (unclear) Now how to master these five elements or how to control them, how to make use of them, how to understand them?  Then they realize one thing that, all these five great elements have a Deity belonging to them, there is some kind of power which controls these elements.   Every one of the five great elements has a power which manages them, and looks after them.

So in the beginning he started to worship the Gods like Agni (fire), Vayu (Air).  All these Yadnyas ( Havan) are done specially for pleasing the five great elements.   In old days, when human beings started farming, or whatever  kind of activities he started, like building houses, or he started big organizations, that time he first had to gain mastery over the five great elements.   So by doing the havan they awakened the five elements.   While awakening the five elements, they found out that within them there are also seven powers.   Out of those, one is Gayatri, another is Savitri, like these there are seven powers.   So the Gayatri mantra was born out of that Veda.  The Gayatri mantra was created by man to awaken the Deities on the Pingala nadi, means, to awaken all the Deities who rules the five elements, the Deities on the right side, the ones who sit on the right side of the Virata was this Mahashakti was created by man.

And when they made an offerings to the five great elements, and invoked upon the Deities within them, then those Deities were awakened.   Because of the awakening of these Deities, this is I am telling you about thousands of years back, even before Rama's time, when all these powers were awakened, then you can say that the relation of a man, we can say at the time of Rama, when we had reached a very high state, there were even the aeroplanes, people used to go by planes, Rama had also traveled by plane.  At the time of Arjuna, there were special types of technics like Chakravuwha (confusing military array), with all these instruments we could win big battles.   We had missiles and everything, and like today they had the pilot-less bombs, they also had everything needed to go in to the space, we had all those arrangements, this is all very true.

For an example, when I went to Columbia a little while ago, and there I noticed a very surprising thing, now where is Columbia and where is India, so people there told me that the symbol of their Navy is a Condor, I was very surprised, Condor is an Eagle, so I asked them that how come you have a Condor as a Symbol of your Navy?  So they said that there is a tale, told by an old (ancient) Indians, Columbia is the only country, where the old (ancient) Indians were not destroyed by anyone.   So their legends still go on.  So there is a tale that the Indian God ‘Vishnu’  came to Columbia, riding on a Condor, this I heard only a year back when I went to Columbia.   So how surprising is this, that Vishnu went to Columbia by riding on a Condor, and that is why they have the Condor as a symbol.   I asked them that, why is Condor as symbol for Navy?  So they told me that, the Navy was there before the aeroplanes.   And we thought that because of Vishnu’s coming by riding the Condor, and we thought that, we are not so highly evolved as Indians, so at least we could use the Condor as a symbol for our Navy.

So at that time we were very highly developed.  Our Indian Civilization was at very high level.   People use to have all kinds of different transport systems, and the palaces they lived in were built so very beautifully.   If you read about the time of Pandavas, about the Mayamahal (place of illusion) which Draupadi had it built, and where she was laughing , all this has come because of the blessing of the Pingala Nadi.   In English we call it an area of Supraconcious, in this area, If a man behaves in a proper way, and able to reach the higher state, then he could find out what is in the center of the Earth, or what is in the Ether, and he is able to roam around everywhere and all that.   But, while praying to the Pingala Nadi, there are lot of things to think about.

First of all, In olden days, when we had the cast system, which was made in a very special way.   When the boys and girls used to get to the age of 20 or 25, they use to go to a university, which could be called a lineage, the boys and girls could not marry each other from the same university.   Not only that, but for years and years, or even generations after generations, if they have a desire to marry someone from there, it was not permitted, it was sinful, irreligious.   Even now people do not marry someone from same lineage.   Means the custom from those days, which was that nobody from the same university could marry each other.   They had to stay celibate for the whole twenty five years of their life.   In that life of celibacy, the realized souls, realized Gurus use to teach Hathayoga to these children.   Hathayoga these days has become a medium of  making  cinema actors and actresses.

Yesterday they were asking me that, Mataji, what is the connection between Hathayoga and Kundalini?  Now, because everything modern has become so dirty, in old days there was the Patanjal shastra, in which has been described the Ashtanga yoga, which has emphasis on all the eight sides of the body.  Just doing the yogasan (yoga posture), means, at that time it would not have even entered their minds, because the asanas and all that, until a boy and a girl, who are unmarried, and have completely kept to celibacy, living in one university like brothers and sisters, used to take initiation from a realized soul.  These days even these asanas  are all false, I notice that all these asanas (yoga postures) are being an obstacle to the awakening of the Kundalini.   There are very few asanas which are true and nourishing for the soul, or you can say that they are nourishing to the ascent of our spirit, there are really very few asanas like this.

These asanas (yoga posture) have come about, due to the people  who had gone to some gurus, in Himalaya, now I don’t want to mention the names of these gurus, .........so in old days the Guru use to give initiation to only very few people, may be only one or two people.  There use to be lots of tests, means, they had to take one step at a time.   Even when they get an initiation at the age of twenty five, they did not receive their realization or spiritual knowledge, but they were prepared for the religious, and dharmic life.  Then some people use to give a very few, and selected people the spiritual knowledge.

So in this modern times some people went to some Guru, in Himalaya, and they were ousted from there, so whatever little they have learned about asanas, they started teaching it here, like sucking the stomach in, and standing on your heads and so on.   And some of these asanas are so reckless and so bad that, some people who tried the Hatha yoga are not able to get their self realization.   They tell me that, Mataji, we feel very good by doing it, so you feel good only physically, that means if you are over using your Pingala nadi, then yes, you will feel good physically, because this nadi has the power flowing through it for the physical and mental side.   Even though the physical side is OK, but what about your emotions?  The people follow this path becomes very dry, because it is a the Chanel of the sun, (Surya nadi), so people who over use this Chanel becomes very dry, such people end up in divorce, they can not get on with their wives.  Also the place of Gruhalaxmi will be spoilt in the home, and they lose interest in absolutely  everything, it is all a nonsense.

Sometimes these people become really hot tempered, like we know that long time back,  Harishchandra was so much tortured by Vishwamitra, is that a way to anyone's betterment? Even though Vishwamitra was a very highly evolved soul (an ascetic), he could burn someone to ashes with a glance, or destroyed someone completely, but these are not the benevolent ways, this is not a way to love, this is not our way, we should not accept such path in Sahaja Yoga.   They say that some people became Maharshis (great saint) by accepting such path, whatever it is, but how is it going to be beneficial for the common man?  And what have they achieved by going to such extreme?  Sometimes I think that such people only goes around, pretending to be sanyasis.  Therefore there is no place for sanyasis in Sahaja Yoga.   Sanyasi is a .....(unclear) and it happens with the complete awakening of the Pingala Nadi.   But this has to be awaken only after gaining the knowledge of the spirit (Atmagyan) through Sahaja Yoga, if you try to awaken it without Sahaja Yoga, it will be incomplete.

This is why you must have seen some sanyasis, who are only sanyasis by wearing sanyasis cloths, and they are all the time been tested.  That means, whatever their age they can not let go of their craze (passion), they are very much attached to their craze, they really have to work very hard to fulfill their passion.   But once you come to Sahaja Yoga, everything about religion comes together properly, that you don’t have try so hard.   The innocence gets awakened in a person automatically.   He does not feel attracted towards someones wife or the things belonging to others, because he becomes satisfied in a real sense.

This method was there for the right side, when the Vedas by saying .....  (unclear) , tried to awaken the five great elements.   The result of that why we have science today.   So where does this science comes from?  The people who use to talk about Vedas and all,  they took birth in the western countries, because they did not feel that they accomplished anything in their last life , so in this life they tried to win over the five elements by using the science.   And they feel that they actually have won over the five elements with science, they think that because of wining over the elements they were able to go to the moon and all that.   But this right side is very much of a maya (an illusion).   Human beings feel that it is very important, and they very much run towards it.  If someone says that you could fly in the sky, so they will instantly will be prepared to pay thousands of pounds for that, this is absolute stupidity, why do you need to fly in the sky?  OK, the birds fly in the sky, so are we going to fly above the birds now?  Do we want to become the birds?  We have airplanes and everything, now have we come to the stage of becoming a bird?  And what are you going to achieve by flying in the sky?

You will be surprised  that about eight  years ago, three great scientists came to see me from America, and I was very surprise to see that how could they be so stupid, I told them that it is possible to fly but you will get bhootbadha (possessed by bhoots), your body will become dry, you will feel like you are all over the place, you will think that while everyone is down on the ground, I am the only one up here and I can see things from above, all this is a possession.   People who are too much on the right side are very much ambitious.   These people who are very ambitious, if they die without fulfilling there ambitions, they are left feeling dissatisfied, so they somehow try and come back into the world again, they will not accept their death.   That is why by entering in to various people, and they do all kinds of experiments.   Out of all these experiments, one of them is trying to cure people.

There was person called Dr Lang in London, he had a great ambition to do such and such surgery and so on, and when he died, his dead spirit entered in to a soldier and he started telling this soldier to go to London and tell his son that he (Dr Lang) exists and he is there within him (the soldier),  the soldier said but how is he going to believe me, so he said just go and see him, and I will talk to him.   After going there this soldier went in to trance and he told the son lots of his secrets, so the son actually believed that his father has entered in to this soldier.   So he started a surgery there, not only that but he opened an International curative center there.  Now they have branches of this center all over.

I come to know about him in Mumbai, because there was a lady who came to see me, and her hands were really trembling, I thought from where did you get such thing, and she told me the whole story, that when she was ill, had some stomach pain, so she wrote a letter to this center, and they wrote back to say that, on such and such date, at five o’clock we will cure you.  At five o’clock, she started to shake, and started perspiring a lot, felt really uneasy in her stomach, and after that she felt alright, means her stomach problem had been cured.  But then she started getting headaches,  after started having headaches she started behaving very confused, and really was in a bad state.   Her husband brought her to me, I said it looks as if they have put some bhoot (dead spirit) in her.

Because,  the Kundalini does not have a fixed time, that you can say we will raise your Kundalini at such and such time, it does notwork like that.   Can you say that the fruit on a tree is going to appear  at  five minutes past ten, can you ever say such a thing?  It is a living process, you can not organize its timing to say it will happen at such and such time.   It can not be organized, whenever it meant to happen, it will happen.  For some people it might happen today, for some it might happen tomorrow, and some it might happen the day after, but even if it happens ( awakening of the Kundalini), you have to sustain it.   Because, if you give the Kundalini awakening to a seed, and it sprouts, but even then if it is not fallen on the fertile ground, and end up on rocky ground, then that seed will be wasted ( it will not survive)

If you people are like rocks then my efforts will be wasted.  So take a look at yourself, and don’t be like rocks.  The awakening which is going to take place in you, has to take proper roots and then big trees should be grown out of it.   We have some Sahaja Yogis who have given realization to tens and thousands of people, and some are good for nothing.   And some are like, they will come once and then don’t get to see their face again.   So we meet  such tedious, dull kind of people every day in Sahaja Yoga.

So this Pingala Nadi has the power to awaken The Bramhashakti, means the five Tanmatra (the potential of five elements) and the five great elements which has come out of it.   Whenever a human being does some action, or he thinks about future, or he thinks about his physical body, to make it look good and fit, and to keep healthy, all this kind of thinking over activate this power.   Apart from that when we do too much physical work then this power gets over activated.   So when only one of the side is over used, then the other side get frozen, and by over using only one side you get in to too much of an imbalance, and a person becomes abnormal.   I was telling you yesterday that when we use the right side too much, then the left side goes out of order, and you get all the left sided diseases, now let’s see that what kind of diseases you get by over using the right side.

I told you that the subject is very vast but I want to tell you in short, so I will try, let’s see, that how much is possible to say.   On top of that the vibrations are very strong today.   Now first of all, when we overuse this power, the main purpose of this power gets neglected.   First main purpose of this Swadhisthan chakra is, (this channel is operated by the Swadhishthan chakra), because Bramhadeva is siting on the Swadhishthan chakra, and he gives the power to this chakra.  So the first job of Bramhadeva is that to supply the power to the creative force.   If you are a big artist, and you are not a Sahaja Yogi, but just an artist, then what kind of diseases could you get!  The first thing might happen that you will become very rigid person (harsh, dry), you will not be a  loving person, nobody will be able to stand next to you, you will become very boring.   If an artist is very famous, then he will try and grow a beard and will try and show that he is an ascetic and all kinds of things like that.   Means they want to be recognized in a big crowd, so people will say that, oh, so you are that big artist, and if you don’t get hit back for saying that, then you should count yourself lucky.  They are very hot tempered, artists are very angry people.  The reason for that is the right side is over used, and there is no balance.  If a person is always on the go, then he becomes emotionless.  These days there is big craze of jogging, don’t know if it has come to India yet, but in all other countries there is a big craze of jogging, means everybody goes for a run in the morning.

There was a dentist, who came to see us and he started saying to me that, Mataji, I am always running, and I have lost all my feelings (emotions), I don’t feel happiness or unhappiness, I have gone beyond all these feelings.   I said it should not be like that, the joy is a separate thing, but becoming a dry, harsh person by going beyond any feelings of happiness and unhappiness, and become dry like a stone, is not like being a human being.   A person like this completely forget about all the human qualities.   He does not even remember that, what it is to be a human.   That means a person becomes very matter of fact, very direct, someone who speaks their mind plainly.    He does not have any idea, that someone might get hurt, or someone will be troubled, or somebody will feel very sad by their harsh words.   And sometimes a person like him can become very successful.   Because according to human beings, success can be achieved through wining over these five elements.

If somebody is a very big officer, or if he is a big politician, then he will definitely get this disease, he will get the disease.   That means he gets affected by Ga (unclear).  You have to take a shield with you for protection in order to approach him.   If you just go to see him without it, then you can not be sure when he is going to break your head.   Once a gentleman went to see a minister, so he was just siting there, and there was  a person who was shouting at everyone, this gentleman was just a villager, from UP, he did not know what was going on, so he ask the person who was shouting, that if something is wrong with him, so he (the minister) said don’t you know that I am a PA? ( in Hindi PA means a drunk) , so the villager said that you should have told me before, that you are  drunk.   So When he became a PA, he started to think that he is something very big, it just went to his head.

So when the Pingala Nadi is over used, you start thinking that I am going to do this work and I am going to do that work, such a person is  possessed by some strange animal.   He becomes a very dry person, he does not have any emotions, feelings, he does not think, he is not able to understand about anyone’s happiness or unhappiness.   Now they say that Maharashtrian people speaks in a very harsh manner, it is a kind of way of speaking harsh here in Maharashtra,  and it has to be actually very heart rending.   People don’t speak so sweetly here.    And reason for that, I think because the Sadhus and Saints use to test us quite a lot , so we think why not we also test others.   But it was a different thing with the Sadhus and Saints, even if they used those methods to test people, we do not have a right to do the same.   We should always speak sweetly to others.   To speak sweetly does not mean that you have to be very subservient (slaves) to others.  Some people will say that, we can not be subservient to anyone.   It’s like they are either submissive or they are aggressive, there is nothing in between.

Our Sahaja Yoga is the center path, so there should be sweetness in your personality, when you speak, there should be some feelings in your speech.   We have to know that the other person also have  feelings.   It is so surprising, specially women, the ones who want to be treated with feelings, they themselves can be very cruel.   Where does this cruelty comes from.  The reason for that is, they are also all the time thinking about the future, means all the time thinking about what I am going to cook, now my daughter is leaving, I will have to cook for her, and I have to do such and such for the husband.   When the person all the time think about all kinds of things, and all the time thinking about the future, at that time the right side gets affected.

When the right side is very much affected, the person becomes very sad, because nobody wants such a person near them, and this is a very big disease, which we can not  see.   We have had many successful people, there is no doubt about it, but because of their dry nature, nobody want to even take there name in the morning, maybe they will say their name in the evening if they have to, and wash their mouth.   Now the people who take to the right side, (the Pingala Nadi) goes to extreme, becomes over active.   They think that whatever work they are doing is the greatest work of all, and they neglect all other work.   You have a family, you have a house, and children, and no attention paid towards it.   Particularly in western countries, it happens a lot.   Men and women both are just the same.   All the time they think that,  they have to achieve something very big in outside world, and make a name for themselves, and want to reach the great heights.    Because everybody is thinking this way, and main thing is that wanting to make money, the other important thing for them is how to make money, so all the men and women are running after the idea of how to make money.   Because of all this, the children are not brought up properly  in the household, the husband and wife are always fighting.   Because of all this The marriage system has come to an end, and nobody get on with each other.

When I went to London, I thought , why all these people are barking at us like dogs, when they are talking, it sounds like they are barking at each other.   It sounds like they are fighting with each other.   If you turn on the TV, they will be showing husband and wife fighting, or will be showing that mother and child are fighting, or brother and sister fighting.   They will only show fighting, you can never see that somebody is talking to each other with love.   And if they do show love then it will be such a dirty kind of love that you can not watch it, you just want to turn off the television.   So you should be loving towards each other.  In my opinion, to look down on anyone,  or talking to anyone in a nasty way is also a kind of a disease and is a fault with our society.    Once these diseases takes place, the whole society collapses.   When we use the Pingala Nadi too much and the Pingala Nadi completely takes over, the a person becomes very dissatisfied  and gets in to a kind of rage, and in that rage he does not realize that how he is speaking with others, or he is behaving in a very shameful manner, or he is hurting someones feelings, or how many Lotuses he has trampled upon.

So what should be done about it, what is the answer?  If I say to people that you should not be planning things, but they don’t understand.  They will say, how is it that Mataji says you should not make plans.   So they think Mataji is very old fashioned.   But I would say that you should not make plans, first you should take a look at the planning which God have made, and then make your own plans.   Now lets see what happened just now,  we had planned to have  the program outside, it is a nice place outside, but The Gods’ desire was for you to sit inside.  So because the plan of siting outside did not work out so you are siting inside.   But if there was a person who had specially made the plan, then he would have canceled everything, he would have said if it is not going according to my plan then it will not go ahead at all.

So for example if we have to go to Pune, so we will say that we plan it out, first we will go left and then we will go right, then we will go left, then you might end up in Thane, or you might end up in mental asylum.   And our country is suffering because of all this kind of mad (demented) planning going on.  You have to recognize the planning of God, unless and until you recognize  what God has planned.   Until then our planning does not have any meaning at all.   Each plan has the knowledge of the spirit,  each plan has the meaning, and each plan has been made by God.   Because God’s work is enormous, and his power is huge.  He possess all kinds of powers.

Now I will tell you how we benefit in Sahaja Yoga, when this Bramhatatwa descends in to spirituality,.  So we have electricity, or when we watch TV, and we have seen how we can do so many things using these five great elements.   You will be surprised that with Sahaja Yoga when this Bramhatatwa gets awakened in us, we don’t have command over it, but when it gets awakened in us, then what happens?  Then the vibrations which are flowing from our hands, they start talking to us.   That means, while sitting here you can tell what is the state of your father, what is the state of your mother, or the state of the Nation.  What is the state of the Prime minister, where he is, where is his Kundalini, where he is sitting, what trouble he is in, what disease he is going to get, or what disease he already have.  You can tell all these things while you are sitting here.

We have a Sahaja Yogi in London, called Gavin Brown, a very good Sahaja Yogi, when he first got his realization, he did not believe in anything what I had to say, because for those people (foreign) this is a huge thing.   So one day he felt burning in his hand, then he found out what it meant, according to the decoding we have done in Sahaja Yoga, it was the Vishudhi finger, and here it is a place of the father, so it was his father who had something wrong with the Vishudhi chakra.   Then he thought that it has been a long time since I have phoned my Mother, so he telephoned his mother in Scotland to ask how she is, His Mother said I am alright but your Father is very ill with bronchitis.

Now we have all this doordarshan (television) and such things , In Sahaja Yoga  all these things happens spontaneously.   Even before Nixon started having all the health trouble, we had said that Nixon was about to die.   We could even tell if someone is about to die, We could tell If someone had died.   We could also find out if somebody had their realization or not, or how good or bad the person is, by feeling the vibrations.  Now you will be surprised to know that how wondrous these vibrations are.  You can find out if there is  beauty in something, by checking the vibrations.  That means these are people of faith, who believe in God.   And now after coming to Sahaja Yoga these people who believe in God has reached very great heights.  Just now these people have gone abroad, otherwise they would have been singing songs before you.

When the Bramhatatwa is awakened, then whatever we do, absolutely any action, it has a real sharpness to it, it takes a certain form, the coefficient of that form start giving vibrations.  As soon as the vibrations start to flow, the person siting next to you, his spirit start feeling the joy, and he really enjoy that art.  There was a Sahaja Yogi, who was unemployed, and he was asking, Mataji, what should I do? So I said to him that you should become Interior decorator, he said how is that possible, I don’t even know anything about it, how is it you are telling me to become an interior decorator? I said you just do it,  you start interior decoration only with using vibrations, and nothing else, and he did it.  Now he has earned millions of rupees doing that.   It’s because you know if something is right or not by feeling the vibrations, and whatever is right according to the vibrations, is absolutely universal.   Whatever is  accepted in the whole world does definitely have the best vibrations.   You get the ability to see the beauty or the good qualities in things.

Now while sitting here you can tell,  if someone had a guru, so even if that guru is dead, you can still find out if he was a real guru or not.  You can not tell this with any electronic instruments, at the most you can telephone to London.  But with the vibrations,you can find out about someone  in London if the person is sick or not, and you don’t have to spend a single penny for it.  So if the person is sick in London and you give him a bandhan from here, he will be feeling better over there.  You won’t be able to manage this.  It also plays some tricks on you.

There was a person in Simla, and doctors told him that he had cancer, so they brought him to Delhi, so some Sahaja Yogis thought we will cure him, means they got in to ego, and they could not cure him, so they telephoned me to say that, Mataji, he does not believe in the Sakar ( in real form, tangible) he only believes in formless, so I said, is that so, who is he to say that he believe in this or does not believe that?  Who is he, is he a realize soul?  On what basis he is saying that he accept this or does not accept that?  So I told them to forget it, don’t bother to cure him or anything, they went and told him, that Mataji told them not to cure his cancer, because he does not want to see the truth, so he said, oh, is that what Mataji said? OK then I apologize.

So then the Yogis went there and he got cured of cancer.   Not just got cured but he is now extremely healthy.   Now the doctors are saying that he never had the cancer.   I said, now you are very great, and also these people are also very great.   This Colonel is screaming to tell them that, look, I had the cancer, have a look at these papers, but nobody even want to look at the papers.   So these people become foolish, they become ignorant, with false knowledge.   Because the ego is such a thing that, if it gets hold of you then you really enter in to the darkness.   The person goes in to such a darkness where he can not even recognize himself.

Now I will show you how a person gets in to an ego, The Ida nadi starts from here, and Pingala nadi starts from here.  Now when the Ida nadi and the Pingala nadi gets activated, then the smoke which comes out of it, like the smoke come out of some factory, or you can say the byproducts, they become the two institutions.   One is ego and the other is super ego.   Mean to say when we do action , it creates an ego in us, which goes from this side (right side) and spreads on to the left side.   And when we act on emotions, then it creates the super ego in us, which goes up from the left side and becomes a balloon on the right side of the head.   This is how we develop the ego and superego.

People who are very emotional, get in to super ego, for example, when a mother is breastfeeding her baby, the baby is very happy, but then the mother says to the baby that, look, don’t cry, I am just going to move you to the other side, but as soon as the mother moves the baby, baby’s ego comes up, thinking that why did she put an obstacle in my enjoyment.   Now the mother told him not to cry, and be quiet, so as soon as the mother told him to be quiet, he gets in to the super ego.  He stops crying but gets in to the super ego.   That means when you hurt ( suppress) someones ego, he develops the super ego.   It is called conditionings in English.   Whatever we read, or the things which we get influenced by that is all because of the super ego.   And whatever work we do out ego, you all already know what happens then.   But influence of moral values and good ethics is different.   Like some people will say that, we don’t believe in this, so such a behavior comes from super ego, why is it you don’t believe? Have you experienced it for yourself or have you seen it with you own eyes?  That means they do not have an open mind.

Someone else with an ego will say that he doesn’t believe in God, or God does not exist, or he does not believe in anything, that  means he is not impressed by anything good.   Some people are impressed  by good morals and ethics, and others are not at all impressed by anything.   So these two institutions which exist within us, which are called ego and super ego.

Now the power of Pingala nadi is placed within us due to the right sympathetic nervous system, when we try to over use this power or we become overactive, then we can get a disease like cancer.   So we need to find out how we get this disease like cancer.   For example, this is one of the chakra, and these are the left and the right institutions, so you can say that this is the work of the Ida nadi and that is work of the Pingala nadi, and in the center is the Sushumna nadi.   So  if we start using the right side too much, then the left side (Ida nadi) loses its connection, and the Deities inside goes off to asleep, or even goes out of existence.   After that the left side starts working internally, and the right side also starts to work internally, and then the  disease like cancer can take place, you can say on their own.

So for whatever reason, if your sympathetic nervous system gets activated, then you might get cancer.   But you will be surprised that the disease like cancer comes from following a false guru, or doing black magic.   It is surprising that the reason behind cancer is somehow seem to be some a false guru.   So you can imagine how dangerous these false gurus must be.   Till today, whatever number of cancer cases I have cured, they all either had false guru or doing black magic.   This effect  of cancer start from the left side, and because the doctors can never sort out the left side, so they will  never be able to cure the cancer.   At the very most they can  cut your neck, cut your nose, take out your eyes,  but they can not cure the cancer.

Now the power in the center, which is the power of ‘Vishnu’, I don’t think that I can explain about it in such a short time, so I will tell you about it tomorrow, together with The power of Shiva.   So we have established Sahaja Yoga with the power of ‘Vishnu’.   If only these two powers (the left and the right) were in place then we would not been able to evolve, and we would not have become human beings from an amoeba.   And we would not have reached this state to be able to come to Sahaja Yoga and to reach the supreme state.  So now put your hands out like this, the vibrations are so very strong , so in a way the rain is doing us a favor, not able to speak even.

Put your hands like this.  Now please close your eyes, the vibrations are so strong today that you will be able to get your realization very quickly (spontaneously), there is no doubt about it.    You have to close your eyes and put your hands towards me.  First you will become thoughtless and then you will start to feel the cool breeze in your hands.   You all should close your eyes and put your hands towards me......(unclear) 50:52.7
