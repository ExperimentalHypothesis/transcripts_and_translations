[Hindi to English translation]

Work starts at 4 o'clock and by the time we finish, it's late from home today. Yesterday I told you that I will tell you about Kundalini. Can everybody see this chart? Those who cannot see, come and sit on this side. Come here and sit here nicely. Those who cannot see, please come to this side. Move a bit this side. Now you can see it. [Inaudible]

[Shri Mataji says in Marathi, “Wind is very strong, right.”] [Inaudible] [Inaudible] Yes! [Inaudible] Sit down now, you see, sit in front of me. Yes, all right. Come this way, one side.

I told you yesterday that the nature of which human beings are made has done wonderful things within us, and that is why we have been created. The things which I am going to tell you now are not described in current modern scriptures. As I told you, current modern sciences only know those things which are comprehensible or can be actually visualized, and this vision of human beings is not yet having the light of Spirit. Still, human beings are not enlightened [matured]. Things which I am now going to tell you can be known only after enlightenment [maturity]. Whether these things are really existing or not existing within us, that you yourself can see.

First thing is that human beings get situated [settled]. Firstly, their existence is formed. The whole universe also initially gets its state. If it does not get its state, it cannot happen. The condition that gets created is due to the power of God that’s within us, this power which we call as energy [shakti] of Sadashiva or energy [shakti] of Shiva. Due to this energy, our existence is created. Rishi-munis named this shakti [energy] as ‘Mahakali.’ This energy comes in us through our right side and settles on our left side. As it has been shown here. “(You show, show Ida Nadi, channel. Come here, this, show that)”

The channel carrying this is called Ida Nadi [Ida Channel]. So, all these things are very minute. These are subtle things. These cannot be seen from outside. But due to this channel only, the left sympathetic nervous system is being manifested in us – left sympathetic nervous system.

So, like this, as the condition is there, the way in which our existence is also there. If there is no existence, we reach death. It means that when this power is not there within us, we get destroyed. Therefore, many people know this as ‘power of destruction.’ When the sun sets, the spell of darkness sets in. In the same manner, as the existence of one power or not existence, both are representing the same power. This power must be said to represent both set and existence.

Another power which is moving in us due to which we create, due to which we think, which retains the body, due to which we keep this body moving, this energy is called ‘Shakti of Brahmadeva’ and this ‘Shakti of Brahmadeva’ is called ‘Mahasaraswati.’ This energy (I am talking in English because we get confused in Hindi language in left and right) passes through our left side and settles in our right side. The channel carrying this energy, which is very minute, very, very minute, is called Pingala Nadi [Pingala Channel].

The channel which is first [Ida] is also called the “moon channel,” and this second channel [Pingala] is also called the “sun channel.” Due to this channel within us, the right sympathetic nervous system, this is a subtle channel, but the material channel which can be seen with the eye, which is an active channel, that right sympathetic nervous system is manifested.

This channel, I told you, is responsible for physical and mental work being performed, due to which we think. The first channel, which is called the ‘Moon Channel’ or ‘Ida Channel,’ activates the Subconscious [Supt Chetan] in us. As you are now listening to my discussion; at this moment, at present, you listen to my talk and immediately you throw it in the subconscious mind. You are listening to this in the conscious mind, and from the conscious mind, you move this to the subconscious mind. And due to this mind, conditionings [sanskar] get developed within you; may be those are good conditionings [susanskar] or bad conditionings [kusanskar]. That is the conditionings of the brain.

Due to this channel our past is created, ‘bhav’ is formed. Means whatever has happened in past, which is called as ‘bhutkal’ [past tense], whatever is over gets collected and stored in us due to this channel only.

And the very minute recording or collection is kept in Kundalini. Kundalini Shakti [energy] is only the residual Shakti of Mahakali. The power of Sadashiva is always there, as if it were a seed. It is from this seed that both these powers are awakened and at the end absorbed in it only. And that’s why it is called as ‘Sadashiva’ because this energy is always present and other energies get awakened from this and get absorbed in this only.

Other than this there is one more energy in between in us: the channel carrying this energy is called as ‘Sushumna Channel’. Some say it as ‘Sushmna’, some say as ‘Sushumna’. It’s having different pronunciations but Sushumna is proper pronunciation, which can be sung in Mantras also.

So, this Sushumna Channel is carrying our activity of ascent, evolutionary processes. Due to this channel, we became from amoeba to human beings. Through all these three channels whatever is achieved, whatever is worked out, whatever a being obtains, whatever has happened, that is stored on our central nervous system, which enters in us through the rear side of the brain going downwards.

Today, whatever human consciousness has, like now at this moment whatever you have obtained, that is settled completely in the central nervous system, your conscious mind. So this way, I have told you four institutions.

The central system, which we call as ‘Shakti’ of Shri Vishnu. By Shri Vishnu’s power, firstly Dharma gets established in us. Through retention of Dharma only, our ascent gets developed. Like if you see the periodic table in chemistry, you can understand how properly and neatly God Almighty has arranged all elements there in it and how He has given different types of energy or special Dharma has been allotted to them.

They have eight valencies, and this you can ask any specialist of chemistry or medical science, and from these eight valencies, some of them have either fulfilment with eight or with four valencies. In case they are complete and due to lack or excess of one or two or three [electrons], transactions take place in between them. This has been created very delicately. This retention also, this retention of Dharma also takes place due to Shri Vishnu Tattwa.

As gold has the quality that it never gets spoiled, it never becomes black, untarnishable, this retention of Dharma is due to Shri Vishnu principle that is active in Nabhi Chakra. When this principle is spoiled, then our ascent is stopped. This principle mostly we have to practice in Sahaja Yoga, and mostly we have to consider this only.

Earlier I told you that Kundalini is residual consciousness of Mahakali power. It has the collection of whatever we have done till this time, what mistakes we had done or what religious acts we had done, what we had gained, whatever kind of conditionings we are having, good or bad, all our diseases, problems, all—not just of this life but of many lives—are taped in this.

And this is your Mother who has absorbed all your conditionings in her and is moving with you every time. That’s why this is called as Sahaja Yoga. But it is settled on your triangular bone in three and a half coils. Why it is having three and a half coils is a topic of great discussion. If I start to talk on this, then time will fall short!

You can see with your eyes whether this Kundalini is there within us or not. When Kundalini gets awakened, you can see how it vibrates on this triangular bone. When there is a catch in Nabhi Chakra, then specially these vibrations can be seen so strongly that any small child also can see this. This does not require any proof. For this, we have made a film also, which we will show on BBC TV.

Kundalini resides here only at this place and nowhere else. You can read some of the books that have been written—one Irwin Sahab has also written such a big book about Kundalini. Till now, he doesn’t know where exactly Kundalini resides. Then why write? Who has given them rights to write such a big book? If he is British, that does not mean whatever they feel, they can write. By reading books and without experience and observing, he had written that maybe Kundalini is in the stomach or maybe a little bit below this or maybe above the seat.

All things made by God are never this way or that way. Truth is one. All this confusion is there only in the human brain, whether it is here or there. Things which have been created by God are just at that place only and not at any other place. You can see this with your eyes. This Kundalini residing at the triangular bone has been moving with you for many lives. Even after death, she is wandering above your head, and when you again take birth, she enters in you and resides inside. Death and rebirth are the work of very great compilation. A dedicated lecture shall have to be given to do justice to this topic.

But we don’t have any connection with death at this moment. Today we are just related to the present, and we will discuss only about it. As the left-side channel, Ida Nadi, is related to our subconscious, our past; in the same manner, the channel from the right side, which is called Pingala Nadi, is related to our future. The channel which is in our middle is related to the present, now, at this moment.

See this gap between these, due to which human beings cannot stay in the present. Either he goes ahead or stays behind but cannot stay in the present. Now see how Kundalini gets awakened. When you hold your hands like this in front of me, the energy or vibrations flowing through me enter through your hands, through fingers. See these fingers—they have not shown this in the chart, but another chart has shown this. These are also having centres on the right and left. On the right hand and left hand are also having these centres, and all these fingers, their edges, you can say ends, at that place are centres [chakras].

When these chakras or centres are awakened, you can feel on them which chakras of yours are caught up and also which of others’ are catching. With this left sympathetic and right sympathetic, chakras of both sides are understood, and when you know chakras, then you can cure any disease due to these chakras. Like yesterday, one girl came, suffering from [inaudible], got spontaneously cured, and started moving nicely. She was having multiple sclerosis, which is incurable; nobody can cure this. Why did she get cured by Sahaja Yoga? Because in this, first, diagnosis is there—determining which chakra is being caught up. Mooladhara Chakra is caught up. Heart chakra is caught up. If you awaken Shri Ganesha on the Mooladhara Chakra and in the Heart Chakra, Shri Shiva is pleased. Then immediately vibrations will come there because his chakras, which are there inside, which are his basic, are cured; then that person will be cured.

Diagnosis also will be done by a human being. That person who gets realized will himself diagnose, give treatment, give medicine, and can give self-realization to others. The first chakra is below Kundalini. God Almighty has kept this here with proper wisdom. So, this chakra is adorned due to Shri Ganesha. It is called the Mooladhara Chakra, and above this is Mooladhara. Triangular bone [sacrum] is called Mooladhara. Some people call it Kumbhkund. Many names have been given. But Shri Ganesha resides on the Mooladhara Chakra, and it’s very necessary to understand this Mooladhara Chakra.

Our sex is controlled by this chakra, and Shri Ganesha has been kept above this. Shri Ganesha is an innocent child. That’s why he has been positioned there because he is so pure that no dirt can touch him. That’s why he is seated there. Because a small child has so much innocence that he is above all such things, that’s why Shri Ganesha is sitting there. Sitting there, Shri Ganesha protects Kundalini, which is ‘Gauri Swaroopa,’ meaning she is married but still has not met her husband, still a virgin. In virginity only, she has created Ganesha and kept him here. See, such a beautiful situation is this, and she is residing there, waiting for her husband, waiting to meet Shiva.

For the protection of her chastity, for her protocol, Shri Ganesha is installed there. Now, on this, I will tell you what ‘Tantrics’ have committed as mistakes. Because I am Mother, I will not say that they do this deliberately because this can be the greatest sin, but this can happen by mistake only. Initially, when they started exploring “manan,” for not having so much purity, it might be that they took Shri Ganesha’s trunk as Kundalini, and due to this, it might be they considered Kundalini at that place where we sustain chakra. Where there is Shri Ganesha, there is no Kundalini. That’s why they developed such a theory that by doing sex Kundalini comes up. May be initially, this mistake happened. Might have happened, but being a Mother, I cannot blame them. They are also my children. But human beings have never done any mistake more than this. See, Kundalini is your Mother, and this is so strong to blame on her.

But by this mistake, all Tantric society was created. In the sixth century, there were riots in our country, and all kings, emperors who were filled with filthy lifestyles were giving more support. They ruined it to such a low level that our entire architecture, scripture, and even our sciences featured it.

They started saying that Shiva and Shakti were homosexual and also started saying that “Ashwamegha Yagnya” is also unisexual. The one who gets blind in Shravan [one season with all greenery around] sees everything green. Such a highest, virgin, great principle they brought down to such a low level.

We are actually Tantric; we know [tantra] and we operate [tantra]. This is your technique, which is called Kundalini, your [tantra]. But these bad people named themselves “tantric.” It is like as if one thief has come and is calling himself a king, and due to this confusion, human beings cannot understand that while discussing Kundalini, why Mataji is saying about purity.

Actually, this Kundalini, which is the purest thing, astonishes people when we relate it to purity. What darkness! Then when such people who do not value character in their life, who are not pure, those who are spending their life in wrong ways, those who have completely prepared themselves for their destruction—if such people try to raise Kundalini, then it’s certain that heat will be created inside them. They will get short-circuited. Problems will come; they will jump and do all sorts of things.

Those who have faced such experiences—it is natural because Shri Ganesha is the survivor of mistakes. He breaks all sympathetic nervous systems. We have such people when their Kundalini was raised; then bristles came out from head to toe, all over their body. This, you see, is not due to the raising of Kundalini but a reaction of the sympathetic that is passing through both sides.

You can see that you cannot raise Kundalini without Shri Ganesha. He is residing at the rear side. But I feel that when people come from foreign countries to our country, they come from bathrooms or drainage, and then they write an explanation of that [drainage] as an explanation of our country. They are donkeys only. If they want to come, then they can come through the main gate and then understand the culture of our civilization!

Such a learned man like Hume—I admire him a lot—was also a donkey because he came the same way and spread all Tantra and promoted its importance. No Indian is remaining with us to tell them the real truth. No one is remaining with us to tell them the real truth, nor did they try to learn the real meaning of the Kundalini system.

When your Kundalini is awakened, you will be surprised to know that you just become like an innocent child because Shri Ganesha is awakened first. At the beginning, the vibrations flowing through your hands are received by Shri Ganesha only. Your hands are towards me. Vibrations enter through your hands and inform Shri Ganesha that now Mother has come, and you become like a small child. He breaks the way in between.

Only after that does Kundalini rise. Kundalini never rises until Shri Ganesha sanctions it. If you are a very impure person, Kundalini cannot rise, or if anybody has damaged your Mooladhara, then it also cannot rise. Nowadays, most [false] gurus do this dirty work. These people break your Kundalini. People become unhappy with me if I say something against their gurus. “Mataji, don’t say this.” Then what? Shall I adorn them with garlands? Or shall I do aarti to them, who break your Kundalini, who destroy your chance to have a second birth, and dispel you from your own right to get this?

These people are just interested in money. They eat your money. I don’t have a problem. They crook you; I don’t mind. Whatever they want to do, they may become thieves. They make your women dirty. If your women are so stupid, let them become dirty. I don’t mind. But when they trouble Kundalini and make your Kundalini dirty, then they should be called “rakshasa” [demons], and they are demons only. I know at least 16 massive demons. They were killed by Goddess many times, and they have been born again and again. They are born in this Kali Yuga [era of Kali], and six rakshasin [female demons] also have taken birth, and people worship them. Such senseless people—they have no limits.

This Kundalini, that is your Mother. She is waiting for the day when her child will get his second birth. She only gives you a second birth. Due to her, you are known as twice-born. If you are a superficial person, if you don’t have any depth in you, if you don’t want that, Kundalini does not rise on her own.

If you have done some mistakes, she informs that he has done this mistake. From your chakras, it can be known that you have done this mistake, that you haven’t done, and, in this way, all about Kundalini can be known completely. But if you have carefully kept your Kundalini properly like as Kabira has said, “Das kabir jatan se odhi, jaisi ki taisi rakhdini chadariya,” at that time Kundalini of such people gets easily awakened.

Now after this, the next chakra above this is called Swadishthana. This chakra comes from our Nabhi and is moving around [Nabhi]. This is known as Swadishthana Chakra. Due to Swadishthana Chakra, our attention is activated. Wherever we put our attention, there Swadishthana Chakra starts working. That’s why when we think too much, at that time Swadishthana Chakra converts, transforms fat from the stomach so that it can be used in our brain. Brain is also having fat globules in it. These fat globules which we use are transformed in the stomach by Swadishthana Chakra and transferred to the brain.

This is the chakra which keeps control of our liver, pancreas, kidney, and some part of the uterus. This is the centre of creation. Whatever we think about the future, we feel like to create, whatever we do planning for the future, then this Chakra starts working and it enlightens our attention. It enlightens our [Chitta]. The person who has a bad liver, his attention is always sad. He will not like anything. It’s not his fault because his liver is not good. That’s why it is called ‘liver’ as it is related to your life. In the same manner, a person who thinks too much and does too much planning, his Swadishthana Chakra also becomes worse because either it is doing the work of thinking and supplying continuously to the brain, the poor thing, or it will look after all these organs.

From these organs, when the pancreas becomes bad, then you get diabetes. Diabetes can be cured 100 percent by Sahaja Yoga, hundred percent. In this manner, due to excessive thinking, the right side of a person is doing excessive work and the left side becomes unsupported or becomes sad, gets neglected. Due to this, when a person thinks too much, works hard, or does too much physical effort, then he gets a heart attack. When he gets a heart attack, then he should understand that, “Now I have done too much.” He becomes imbalanced. He should understand immediately that now he should pay attention to emotions and try to bring balance.

In Sahaja Yoga, after self-realization, there is a very simple process to bring balance: raise the left side and put it on the right side. Just now, many people came here who were not able to get realized, their only left side was raised and put it on the right side only three times, then immediately their Kundalini came out. As you can see here, when you think too much or when you are very busy with work, then your ego gets developed, as shown above, which actually goes through your head up to here, revolving like a balloon. When you develop conditionings in yourself, it means when you try to press this ego, then superego is awakened in you, which is called superego. It comes from behind you to the right side – that's also an imbalance. In this manner, two different types of balloons are developed in you. When one balloon is more developed than another balloon, then it tries to control another balloon, and it exerts pressure on another balloon. Nowadays, ego is more developed in Indians because we are developing, so we do much planning. We are very active; that’s why due to thinking, our ego is increasing. Nowadays, in Western people, superego is increasing because initially, their ego was so much grown up that it completely controlled superego. So, they were disturbed, and through ego, they started thinking there should be some control over this, and they started taking drugs, etc. Due to intake of drugs, superego was increased. As superego gave a push to ego, then ego came here, and superego was expanded. Now wobbling is going on in between these two. They are pushing each other from here to there, and nothing is in its proper place. All the time, wobbling is going on in between the two in their minds. They are having very different worries. As you know, those who are in very wealthy countries, like Sweden, are having more suicides because in their minds, this quarrel of ego and superego is going on. Living is not in their tract. In one minute, you can see in America hundreds of people: somebody’s nose is moving, somebody’s head is moving, somebody’s eyes are flickering, somebody’s mouth is twisting. They cannot sit in peace for one minute. If you see young people, you can see big wrinkles over here due to worries. The reason for this is the quarrel between ego and superego, which is continuously going on within them. Fallacy and confusion is going on in their mind that they don’t understand, “What is it?” And by taking benefit of this, demonic powers or negativities enter in their brain. And that’s why they follow such things so that they can run away from this and can run away from all problems in this world.

Swadishthana Chakra is very important. Because those people who do excessive work either go to extreme, we call this as supra conscious area which is on right-hand side. So, when it’s transgressed, then we enter into collective supra conscious. In this manner, when they are transgressed on left side, then he enters from [personal] subconscious into collective subconscious. Upper part of human beings is of collective consciousness. The person who thinks too much about dead persons, about death specially in Buddha Dharma [religion], this has entered. It’s surprising, I don’t understand that why Buddhists have given so much importance to this. It’s surprising. That why did Buddhist give so much leverage to this, although as per me, Buddha must not have considered. And Buddha said, to the extent that, don’t worship any dead things. Buddhist people are just opposite to this. If you go to Ladakh or if you go to Tibet there Buddhists, many of them do tantrism. ‘Pret Vidya’, ‘Shmshan Vidya’, ‘Bhoot Vidya’, with Mahavira followers is also the same thing.

But these people go to more extremes than Mahavira followers. But at least Mahavira’s followers, due to their going opposite or whatever it may be like, but they will build temple, create caves, will do drawings, if not find anything else, then will work for cloth shops, sell clothes; do such acts.

And Buddha followers – but Buddha who never talked about death, surely Mahavira has said about death and hell, but Buddha never talked about death – all are just going on discussing about death. In Ladakh, there is a sign formed about which person is to be seated, in what way; how a person is to be buried, how his hand is to be kept; how he is to be managed. In which text of Buddha it is written, I know not; but I can tell you for now that He cannot write such a thing. All this necromancy, tantrism, all force them towards the left side. And with this you have the equations about whom you must have heard dakini, shakini, hakini, etc., etc., in this way have seven resonances. With its resonance a person is just pushed forward in collective subconscious and in collective subconscious. And all those persons who are dead are there who are afraid of their life, who run away from life, sly being. Those who are very wicked in nature are also there, very nefarious people can also be there. But they don’t have courage to do this work openly. They do this dirty work very secretly. Those people who are not satisfied in this way are also wandering there only.

Our place is beyond this. When we are dead then we stay in collective conscious and we are waiting for the day when we will get rebirth. We don’t believe that you wander here and there with unsatisfied emotions. These wandering beings in [their] left side are very bad and when they enter in our body through our Agnya Chakra then a person can get infected with diseases or becomes mad or many other different diseases. All these diseases are of Ida Nadi and those diseases which psychologists treat, are due to our left subconscious. So, our Freud Sir was only intelligent according to me, he was just having one eye and didn’t have another eye. He just saw one side but he did not see another side. He used to say that, “It’s all conditionings and nothing else and as it starts only with sex.” He brought all things in front of it. If he would have read at least little bit of Indian ‘Sexology’, then he would have improved little intelligent. But his vision was so much one-sided, he just used to see only one side, and he himself was very disgusting. He was having a bad relationship with his own mother and that’s why he put forth all that filth. And this must happen because if psychologist all time stays with mad people, then he himself will become mad. All that filth comes in him that he sees in mad people. This maybe psychologist doesn’t know. And the one who has come with me here, he is very, very good psychologist there, he himself told this. Because if somebody has got TB [tuberculosis] then we understand that he has got TB, need to protect ourselves. But we don’t understand any way to protect ourselves from these [dead] spirits, possessions. We meet them, we talk with them, then it might happen that we also take something from them. And due to this reason, they cannot cure many people’s diseases because they cannot see them. This is a very subtle thing. It resides inside us and it is there, surely there, and this is settled in us.

Now if you go to the right side then in right side you reach in supra conscious area. Then from there, if you encroach beyond, you reach the collective supra-conscious area. At this place, those people who are very ambitious stay. They are very ambitious people, those who always talk about the future. When someone’s spirit gets satisfied, then they reach the future location. But as Hitler is dead, he must still be there because he is still not satisfied. This place is made for more ambitious people.

When you go to the supra-conscious, then one of these gentlemen (Preit) enters in you. When these spirits enter you, they will drive you too. You will do all that a madman does. He will run around like a mad person. You will just see that either he will get a heart attack or he will go mad. Then he gets absorbed. You must have seen many children, those studying and after that securing first class, first position, and then flat. After securing first class, first, suddenly fall flat. This is quite common, and it is because of this only.

Expecting too much of a thing to the extreme... If it’s too much, this must not happen. Hatha Yoga or transcendental meditation is this only. In this, only some ambitious spirit is implanted in you. A spirit named “Ram” is filled in you, then you start working. You start working very hard. They start working on you. In ten years, your condition will become like a used-up car making khad khad sounds when running.

Now, I have been to Milan; there, they were the first to do trans. There, whoever did trans, today if you go and see, you will hold your ears not to involve in it. Because when you go in trans, you enter this supra-conscious area only. These spirits of the supra-conscious ride on you. The spirit of trans rides on you, and whatever is your own is all lost. You take somebody else’s load on yourself and roam around. Suppose if Hitler comes and sits on you, what will be your condition? It might be you become a very successful person. The whole world may see you as successful. But after ten years, your condition will become such that you... not ten, hardly in one year. Had there been any Buddhist sitting, that could have been seen within one year.

In your Delhi, there was one ‘Sahab.’ Last year, when we came, she came before us and started saying, “Mother, my condition is such that I have no stamina, I tremble while walking; if there is fragrance, it suffocates. My condition is that I cannot go through any temple or masjid. If anybody says the name of God, then my breathing becomes faster. What is this?” I removed her possession, and then she is better. So this is a spirit. And so, you need to understand that both things are wrong.

We have to be in the centre, the middle way. This has also been told by Buddha. The same thing has been told by all, that we have to be in the centre. Now about the Nabhi Chakra, that’s in the middle. I told you yesterday about someone else. That Nabhi Chakra of our country is spoiled. One thing about God is that why God must give you happiness and peace, why give joy and wellness? You don’t even seek Him. You don’t even desire to know Him. You are wandering hither and thither. You don’t recognize Him, you don’t want to know Him, just loitering all around.

I ask you on His behalf, “What justice have you been doing to God?” He has created all this nature for you, and you are just fighting head-on. You are quarrelling among yourselves. Even two brothers cannot stay in peace; then why should God look after you? Whatever questions have popped up are all human-created questions. This is because human beings have adopted demonic power in themselves and are forgetting all about God; then why should He help you? What is that to Him? Today He has created you, tomorrow He will destroy and will again create another world.

He has no concern with you. It’s me only that I am Mother and feel that, “No, children should be saved,” and this is going to happen. What do you think, that you will be sitting relaxed? That thing is going to happen. It’s all right that now time has been given; now you get realized, then it’s all right. Else Kalki incarnation is going to come, and when it comes, He will not see anybody, He will not give realization to anybody, will not give lectures to anybody. Like me, He is not going to meddle with you. “Baba” settle, settle, settle. With one sword, He will just cut and finish you.

He will create a situation where you will not understand where you are. That’s why you must understand that now the last time has been given to us, and this is the last moment also, and we should get it. Don’t spoil your life by treading on the wrong path, by hankering after the wrong things. Because your life is very precious. Through so much difficulty, you have been created. See, all chakras have been created by God Almighty within you. Firstly, the beautiful centre like Mooladhara on which Shri Ganesha is residing, then Kundalini that you call Mooladhara. Then after that, the Swadishthana Chakra due to which you can control the whole of nature.

See, when we were coming here, these people told us that in Delhi it’s raining a lot. I said, “Don’t worry, let us reach.” Since the day we arrived, the rain has stopped. Suddenly, the rain stopped. It’s not difficult work. We say that even to control the sun and all that is not a difficult job. But human beings are very difficult to correct, very difficult. The most difficult thing is human beings. Sun, moon, stars, all are under the gesticulation of God. It’s no difficult task. But human beings, who are free, in front of them even God is also bowing down. How, by which way, should He persuade you that, “See how beautiful a thing He has created within you? Through this beautiful thing, achieve God, get joy through this.”

But human beings are not relieved for even two minutes to sit, settle in God, achieve it, clear it, and give it to others. But they don’t have time, though actually, they always have a watch. For what purpose has God given you time? What for all secrets of nature, which you actually call science, has God opened to tell you? From where did you get all these powers? For what purpose will you save time? Everybody will save time. “We want to save time.” What for? They will say that, “We want to go to the pub, that’s why we are saving time.” What to say! By saving time, we want to go to the ballroom for dancing.

This time saving—you need to save time so that you can do meditation, settle in meditation, and achieve your Self. That’s what God has given you all these powers for. And above this, you can see the Nabhi Chakra, about which I told you yesterday how important this Nabhi Chakra is. That’s why I will not tell you more, but human beings get evolved through Nabhi only. When their vision goes to God, they get their ascent, and then only their sight reaches the Almighty.

So long as attention is always on money, status, politics, or all lower-level things, the Kundalini cannot rise. Now this chakra is very important within us and should be cherished. This needs to be well preserved and understood—how the Nabhi Chakra can be properly kept and what must be done for it. You should understand how your Nabhi Chakra is going to work; you must talk to these people about it, and they will tell you. On top of that, because it is a very necessary chakra, it is specially created in us. When the role of upliftment was created in the Nabhi Chakra, it means the role of upliftment in us; then you know that Dashavataran took place.

This means that one by one, incarnations took place. Firstly, the fish incarnation took place. This means that initially, the fish came out. After the fish, when it touched the land, it became a reptile. Then the incarnation of the tortoise took place. All these things are in the scriptures, and you have seen them. In this way, one by one, creatures were developed. Incarnation does not mean that they are over—they come and evolve you. But this life that evolves from the partly formed aspect of God tells you, guides you, and gets positioned within you.

So from this, whatever incarnations took place mostly occurred in the Void, and from there, they kept helping you. Since that time, many people tried to achieve God, but every time the demonic or satanic people failed their efforts. At that time, as you know, Goddess Shakti herself incarnated. It is said that about a thousand incarnations took place; in Kalyuga, many incarnations occurred. She did massive work securing all those people who, for their ascent, had been doing Yagnya, etc., in the Void. She protected them.

Yagnyas were performed with the intention to enlighten all five elements in nature. That’s why yagnyas were performed. Now there is no need to enlighten these elements. All of them are already enlightened in you. Because of this, you get electricity and are able to use magnetism. Due to the enlightenment of all these elements, you are able to do agriculture and have all these new advancements like mass manufacturing materials. All these are because of the enlightened elements. That’s why now there is a need to go beyond all your dharmas. You need to attain the extreme of your evolution.

This means you have to get introduced to your own Spirit. This is your job. All other jobs are finished. Only this is the last job. Now, as I told you, this Goddess incarnated for your protection, and she has a thousand names. Whatever is expressed about her will be insufficient. You all know how important the Goddess’s divine powers are—how they are famous, dynamic, and so subtle. It’s not easy to express. It sees all that which is not in you, and it’s so difficult to express it. This means it’s so active, so subtle, and so loving that if one of her fingers is moved, the whole world will be moved. So much power she beholds.

This Goddess incarnated many times and destroyed demons so that you can move around freely. Now in the right side of the Heart Chakra, in the centre of it, is the place of Jagdamba, who is your Mother. When you forget that Jagdamba is your Mother, a sense of insecurity develops in you, and when this happens, you get diseases of breathing, such as asthma and all that. So, asthma and in case of women, they get breast cancer. This is also caused due to this centre. This sense of insecurity is developed because this abode of Shri Jagdamba remains destitute, and it is cured only with the awakening of this abode of Jagdamba. All such diseases like lung cancer, etc., are cured due to the awakening of this centre. Whatever human diseases like cancer, etc., get cured by awakening the place of Jagdamba. But till human beings don’t know that we have the abode of Shri Jagdamba in us. To know all means to enlighten. I don’t mean that to know means knowledge. There is a lot of difference between knowledge and enlightenment. When one gets enlightened that Jagdamba resides in us, then only does this Chakra get alright.

The chakra which has been shown on its right side is the chakra of Shri Rama. Here we have the incarnation of Shri Rama. This is the place of the father.

On the left side, there is the abode of Jagdamba. In the centre is the abode of Jagdamba, and on the left side is the abode of Shri Parvati, who is our Mother. This is the abode of the mother. That’s the place of Mother, which is on the left. If you have a catch on your left, then if questioned about your mother, then we get to know that either your mother is sick or she has been dead or on her deathbed. If your left is absolutely still, it means you are going to have heart trouble. If the left gets a little catch, then I see that you have heart disease.

After this, the next chakra/centre which is above is a very important chakra, called the Vishuddhi Chakra, and through this 16,000 nadis or channels pass from the head. This is the abode of Virata, which is called by the primordial master, which is all this primordial being, and in which you all are these small, small cells, which is called as mind in English. This is that big wire that God has inserted within and resonated. When these cells are awakened, then this Great Body is also awakened. The Incarnation of God or Goddess created you as a human being, and now you know Him and achieve Him. This is your enlightenment. For this reason, this Chakra has importance, especially from the Sahaja Yoga point of view. This Vishuddhi Chakra is the place of Shri Krishna. We cannot understand Shri Krishna now as He is ‘Almighty’. Shri Krishna was a very Great Diplomat. If you want to learn from him, learn politics and diplomacy.

The complete Geeta is full of His diplomacy, which you can understand. Because He was such a Great Diplomat that He thought, these are foolish, and these foolish people cannot understand straightforwardly if you tell them, so it’s better to bend the method. That’s why He told you all things in puzzled ways. This I will tell you in brief as there are many things to be told now.Krishna has already told you in Geeta to find Him, know Him, and for that you just find yourself, know in your quiet mind, know the people above you—in the first chapter.

This is also extreme because if He could be understood, then He said to Him, "You are saying know yourself; on the other side, you are saying fight, I am not understanding." What He meant was that, when you have become a witness, then what is lawful, and what is unlawful? But when Arjuna asked such a question, He responded with great respect as a father. Diplomacy has been done with him which should also be done with you.

We are Mother, and hence we are telling you clearly that you are being befooled, because if you want to be an idiot, then what? The father’s way is different; Mother’s is different. He fooled you in such a way. Take it that there is a son, and he is sitting in the horse-cart and wants to drive it. And the horse is tugged behind. Then the father came and said, "Son, your work will be done only when you tug the horse in front; only then will your cart move." So the son said, "No, I will do it by keeping him behind." So the father came and explained to him. He did not understand, so he said, "Okay, you keep driving, keep driving all the time but keep your mind on the horse."

What he said to you was to keep your attention on the soul. Whatever deeds have been done, they will have done that one condition. Reach up to. I am very dizzy. Whatever deeds were done, there is great confusion. Keep the whole burden on God. This cannot happen. This diplomacy puts absurd conditions—absurd conditions. If you think that whatever we do, we are great karma yogis. Leave God alone. You have no faith in Him. Keep doing it. It can never be yours because you have been befooled.

As long as you haven’t attained yoga, you will do any work. Never think that you have got any result from it. When you ascend, then you will see another kind of language. It is ‘happening’ or ‘coming’. Speak in the third language: ‘It is rising; it is running’; it is happening’; ‘Kundalini is rising; they have transcended.’ Even if you have your own son, you will still say, "Mother, what to do, he cannot ascend." Whoever has to get it, they get it, and who can’t, they can’t get. "Karmanye Vaadhika Raste Faleshu Maha Kadachin." All this is done in Sahaja Yoga. That Karma: Look, we are raising this Kundalini. Brought it to the top, then Kundalini dropped. What do we do? If Kundalini does not hold, then what should we do?

Faleshu Kadachin. Now leave your work to God because it does happen. There is no question of its being; it can’t be. You have come into inaction now. Things are flowing from your hands. There is the sun, sitting in inaction but Lighting the whole earth that you are seeing, you can see greenery all around. It's for Him that every leaf is greener, but He too is in inaction. Inactively active. Himself is inactive and active from within. Seeing own inactivity and releasing from inactivity. This can happen only after ascent, but when (unintelligible) happened. Keep running (unintelligible). But Mother, it's different. She said, "Son is now tired of running.” "(Unclear) This is what I will say, (unclear) this is the difference. Even then, what to do? (Unclear) That thing is something (unclear).

It is the same in Bhakti Yoga, Bhakti Yoga also. In Bhakti Yoga, it is said Pushpam, Phalam, Toyam—Whatever flowers, fruits, and water you give us, we will accept that; but what will you give us? So they say in it that [inaudible]—this is too much, see, no one has paid attention to the amazing word that has been used, everyone is listening to the sermon on Geeta (unclear). There is a very good word which you did not understand. This is his wonder. But what does the word 'do exclusive devotion' mean exclusive? When there will be no one second. Means, it will happen only after you have transcended. This is the catch. Do exclusive devotion. How to do exclusive? Unless you are, you cannot do it. Absurd conditions should be imposed, this is diplomacy. This is it. Do anything in such a way that the one who has the abnormal condition will get confused by the other. Unless there is exclusive devotion, your devotion will be no. You cannot be exclusive unless you ascend. The meaning of your giving is that yes, you get realized. This is its point.

If you understand that even in Geeta Krishna has described the whole Sahaja Yoga only. This leela they have done is, in this leela, in that—Radhaji was actually Adishakti. When from the river Yamuna did they come from, the whole water vibrated. Now, when the Gopis went there to draw water, Krishna used to bang them with little stones. That vibrated water used to flow down on the entire Kundalini, ‘dhud, dhud, dhud.’ He used to raise it up. Look at His amazing feats (unclear) since childhood. When He was the youngest, just four years old, He hid the clothes of Gopis, and then also, He used to awaken their Kundalini, sitting up there. And were looking where the Kundalini was; what it is? Did such people sit there then? At that time, someone in Gokul would say, "Brother, sit like this" and give a lecture, would anyone listen (unintelligible)? Raas, that too was this. 'Ra' meaning power and 'S' means ‘with.’ ‘Ras,’ ‘ras' meaning 'Ra' means Shakti was made to dance holding her hand in hand. One may get tired while dancing (unclear), but then kept dancing and raising the Kundalini. As long as He needed, He used this power. Whatever He did was all Sahaja Yoga.

When Ram also took Sita along with him without wearing shoes on feet, that too, so that the whole of Bharatvarsh be vibrated. Roamed bare feet, made everyone vibrate; created this whole drama. What has happened is that we awaken our land by walking on our land. Came eight thousand (hundred) years ago. When the time came today, when we came, we saw that you all are now English. What to do with the British now? All those feelings are gone, all that beauty is gone, that simplicity is finished, that purity is gone. Now we are holding our heads wondering what to do now? Now when the time has come to offer the urn, you have made yourself this condition. Even now in our villages by the grace of God simplicity is quite good, and you guys too if you understand this thing and get rooted in it, Sahaja Yoga can be established very well. Doing one thing (unintelligible), you will be surprised how the whole surroundings have changed.

Now if asked whether communism or democracy is better? Capitalism is good, or communism is good (unclear)? I said that this biggest capitalism is that first your power has awakened, all your own wealth. And without giving you do not get peace, this is the biggest communism. You are not going to get peace without giving, this is your communism. And both things we get in Sahaja Yoga. In this one gets joy in just keep giving. Then there is no fun in how much money you have saved, how much assets you have, how many things you have, but there the question is how many did you transcend? Enjoys this, remains busy in this, in giving vibrations, and in giving, he accumulates through meditation. The entire health of a person changes from top to bottom because this is a living process. Just like if a tree gets damaged, it may be set by humans. But if its upper globe, you may understand—if its pillar gets damaged, you cannot fix it. But you can fix a tree because you are alive; but completely One must understand and grasp what is important. One should not waste one's time on useless things.

Just today a lady had come, her health was so bad. I said, "What do you do?" She said, "Upvas." We said, "Are you crazy?" When you went it was all good. God created everything. What is the point in fasting? Some fall ill due to overeating and some due to fasting. Oho, what is kept in it? Stay in the middle. No one should go to extremes. Some religious person will rise beyond ‘Gunatit’ and then when Kundalini will cross the Vishuddhi Chakra and reach Agnya Chakra, then you will know that you are going into a thoughtless state.

I have given a lot of speeches today and you know that for the last two or three months I have been giving speeches three-three, four-four times continuously. And very successful Vidya. Tomorrow there is no program here but in the evening I will try because I will tell you completely about these chakras and what are the benefits of Sahaja Yoga, I will tell you about this also in the evening. Hope you all will come. Let's meditate for a while because only in meditation there is achievement, and in achievement itself lies all its main reasons and the main purpose, everything else is fine. However, even through speech, your Kundalini may be awakened a little and that's why we do it. Hopefully, you get it, and once you get it you settle in it – it's not that you came for two minutes and left; this is not a movie show, or a play, or anything like that. That you have gone and gone – one has to settle in it. You yourself are an actor in this. For an actor, it's not that he does it only for one show. You yourself are on the stage. The stage is completely readied for you. You come and act.

It is not that you came and saw, directed good things and went away. You yourself get on the stage and work. For the evening after today's speech (unintelligible – meditation will be at 5 o'clock?) and we will finish by 7 o'clock. Because I have to go from here, it will take a lot (unclear – time?) Although we do not wear the clock and especially in this, we don't pay attention; our clock is always in reverse mode, and all this keeps (unclear) happening by devoting to this. Freelancer, what to do? All in the same way, things keep going and this is how things get accomplished. So please excuse us if we ever come late, that’s necessary because its auspicious time is late. Our events are done at the auspicious time. The one in which we were right now (unintelligible) – One, we also have fifty programs.

One Sahab started saying, there is a sir, "There is a very good land at the sea beach; Mother, it will be very nice there, but just take a look once." And on the same day a gentleman organized a puja asking everyone to come and attend the puja. It was his birthday that day and there were many programs. And that Sahab took me somewhere near the sea. While walking there for three-four miles they broke some of our legs (got tired) and after that, it was too late to come back. We had come comfortably. When he came to say that, everyone was sitting, it was 2 o'clock. The puja started at 2:30. So everyone said, "Mataji, puja is taking place at 2.30, now when will we have dinner?"

I said, “What if there is no food for a day? What disaster has happened?” I said, "Okay, find out when you yourself were born." Then he said, "I don't know." We said, "Just find out." You were born at 2:30, that's why it was 2:30, did the puja. And it was found out that it was 2:30. So we take all the Panchang when we move and that ephemeris is so good that it's so accurate. Just now someone (unclear) asked that (unclear). That day is ‘Amavasya’ [No Moon day], or it is ‘Navami’ yes, it is Navami. Yes, so he said, "Start the havan in the morning."

We said, "Yes, yes will, will," like this. Kept postponing, kept postponing. While doing so it was four o'clock. So he said, "Mataji we are thinking of performing Havan since morning." I said, "What, you guys will meditate? Meditate, what kind of problem is there on this day?"

Then I said, "Okay, find out when, at what time did Navami start?" Because the intention was to do it on Navami. So he said, "From four o'clock." I said, "Just see." We have no will plan. Say us to read any almanac, we don't know. But everything remains our calendar, we follow our own Panchang and you people should also learn this.

Many resolutions then 'Sankalp Vikalp Karoti'. Such people get hurt. And then people start saying, "Mataji, look at our...."
