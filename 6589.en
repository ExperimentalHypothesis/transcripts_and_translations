[Hindi]

They have done three songs, have they? One more ... one more ... 

[Hindi]

[Yogi asks about taking of photos during Shri Mataji's talk.]

But when I am talking, one should not.

You have to sing one song more, smaller one. Hamid, My spectacles. My spectacles.

[Yogi explains to Shri Mataji that they have already spoken about chakras, etc.]

I bow to all the seekers of truth. As I told you yesterday, that truth is what it is. It cannot be conceptualized, and cannot be felt at this human awareness. For that you have to become a subtler being that we call as the spirit.

Today I'm going to tell you about the nature of spirit. Spirit is the reflection of the Father, the God Almighty. The seat of that is on top of fontanel bone area, but He is reflected in our heart; while kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Mother.

So this spirit, when it is enlightened into our attention, our attention becomes active: in the sense that if you pay attention to something, it doesn't act there, but on the contrary wherever you pay attention, that acts upon you. On the contrary an enlightened soul, even a glance of such a person can manifest peace, joy in the other person. The spirit, when it starts showing through your central nervous system, you develop a new dimension on your nerves, by which you can feel your own centers - that is self-knowledge, and you can feel the centers of others. It is absolutely accurate sensation you get on your fingertips. If you know how to put these centers all right, then you get physical, mental, emotional complete balance.

The center is like this, and when we start using it on the right side or left side too much, then it becomes constricted. Sometimes a certain shock can just break it, and then you develop maladies, physical and mental. But when the kundalini passes through these centers she puts them right and enlightens them, because she's now connected to the spirit. So the spirit tells us what is wrong with us. This is the Last Judgment. Also this is the Resurrection Time. We are going to judge ourselves, and we are going to resurrect ourselves through Sahaja Yoga. 

Spirit is the source of truth, absolute truth. If you have ten children who are realized souls, and if you tie up their eyes, and put somebody before him and ask what's wrong, then they will all put up one finger. That means they all are saying that something wrong with the throat of the gentleman. And if you ask the gentleman, "Is something wrong with your throat?" he says, "Yes, but how do you know?"

In the light of the spirit gradually you understand this divine Power, which is all-pervading. And if you know how to work out this divine Power, you can also raise the kundalini of others and give them, others realization. Also you will know which man is truthful and which man is not, because immediately as soon as you put fingers towards such a person, you will feel terrible heat if he is a crook; because in your awareness you develop a new dimension called as collective consciousness. 

First you develop a state, what we call as nirvichar samadhi, meaning "thoughtless awareness." For example, there's a nice carpet here and I look at it, and I start thinking about it. But after enlightenment you see something and there is no thought; because thoughts come from the past or from the future, but in the present there is no thought. So when you see something, whatever joy is created by the artist starts pouring on you and absolutely soothes you down. Your stress, your worries all disappear, because spirit is the source of peace.

There are many people who start talking about peace, but they have no peace within themselves. They also get Nobel Prizes in peace, but what's the use - they have no peace within themselves. But it is like a wheel: when the wheel is moving and you are at the periphery, you are disturbed; but if you go to the axis of the wheel, it's peaceful. In the same way you, your state becomes that of an axis. Like if you are standing in the water, there are waves coming and you are afraid of the waves - like the thoughts coming from the right and left, future and past. But if you get into the boat, then you are no more afraid of the waves. But if you learn how to swim, you can get into the waves and bring people with you back to the boat. 

This is the third, this is the second state where you arrive, is the doubtless awareness, nirvikalpa samadhi, where you become very knowledgeable. Your light of the spirit enlightens your brain. What we know through human awareness is very little, but when the brain is enlightened you start discovering new things. We have some scientists who have discovered lots of things after coming to Sahaja Yoga. It gives a new dimension to your creativity. We have many artists, musicians who have become world-famous after coming to Sahaja Yoga. Physically you feel all right; all incurable diseases can be cured, most of them can be cured with Sahaja Yoga. Some people take more time, some less, but most of them are cured. But it is not meant for people who are frivolous, or people who do not want their realization. It is meant for people who seriously are seeking honestly the truth. People who have been even spoilt by false gurus or for following some religions in the wrong way, all can be saved.

In the light of the spirit you become your own master, because you see the truth. For the first time you feel this all-pervading Power which does all the living work; and then if you know how to handle this great power, you can become masters. You become extremely dynamic, fearless, but at the same time very compassionate. And this has to happen to all of you. Only those who do not want, or those who are not destined, will not get it. But it is not a plastic growth, that you can create thousand flowers of plastic - it is reality, and so the becoming is important in Sahaja Yoga. Above all, your spirituality, your divinity start expressing itself and you become automatically righteous, and you enjoy your virtues.

The greatest thing about Sahaja Yog today is that it's a collective happening. Before this, people had to cleanse themselves by going to Himalayas or hiding themselves in some caves. They had to do lots of penances. But in Sahaja Yoga, collective work makes you absolutely perfect. It is like if My nail is broken then it will not grow - it has to be connected with the whole. Once you are connected to this divine Power, then you all become part and parcel of the whole. You are not only guided, but also very much protected and blessed. Specially it gives you joy. Joy cannot be expressed, cannot be described. It doesn't have duality of happiness and unhappiness; it is absolute in its nature. It is just to be experienced, and that is what will happen to you.

Today again if you have some questions, I would like to answer; but again I have to tell you that I have not come here to take anything from you. So please ask Me a question, any question which is relevant. Thank you very much.

[Question]

Yes, of course. Continuously. You have to know about it, for which you don't have to pay anything. All this knowledge is absolutely free. You cannot pay for the divine work.

[Question]

They are all our mistakes, these are human mistakes. Human beings have to change, they have to be transformed.

[Question]

No, it cannot be. It cannot be by any exercise, or by reading or by anything. It is a living process. Like the seed, you cannot force it to sprout. You have to put it into Mother Earth.

[Question]

They all have to be upset. All the religions are just making money. "Yoga" means "union with the Divine." All scriptures have said that you have to be born again. Nobody is paying attention to that; they are just busy collecting money.

[Question]

He has never said so. You better read your Bible again. Of course word of God is there, no doubt. Hello! .... What is it? It is not - it is of course the word of God. Hello, listen, sit down. I'll tell you. Sit down. I'll tell you what. It is, Christ has said that it is the word of God, and I am using word of God alone. Sit down. Also He has said that "I'll send you the Holy Ghost." If I am the Holy Ghost, I am God also. Please be seated. If I am the Holy Ghost, how will you recognise Me, as a Christian? How will you recognise Me?

I am the Holy Ghost. I have to say this, because if you bring Bible here, I'll have to tell you; because, because I give comfort - we have cured so many people in the whole world. There are three doctors who have got M.D. in Sahaja Yoga. There are forty doctors in Russia who are practicing Sahaja Yoga. And I am counselling you, I am telling you what Christ could not tell, because in three-and-a-half years He was killed. They were the same people who were reading Bible and saying, "This is not our Saviour" - and they killed Him. And the third thing is the redemption. Holy Ghost has to be a Redeemer, and that's what it is: I am giving you realization. This time don't miss it. 

Three-and-a-half years they allowed Christ to live, and they are using His Bible when I'm here. When Christ was there, they were using the Old Testament to decry Him, and talking about Moses. By reading Bible, if you people would have achieved anything, you would have seen to it. I was Myself born in a Christian family. And do you know what Christians have done with this Bible? If you go to South America you'll be shocked. Billions and billions of Red Indians were killed by Christians showing them Bible. In India they brought Bible in one hand and a gun in the other. 

Don't miss it. The time has come for you to get your realization, to take your resurrection. You were born in a Christian religion, so you believe in Bible; but those who are born in Islam, they believe in Koran only. They think all the Christians will go to hell, and the Christians think that all the Muslims will go to hell. What about the Jews? When you have blinkers and when you put blinkers, you do not see the unity of God. This has .... Those people who read Koran, Bible, Gita, anything, they follow any religion, commit any sin. Are they righteous? Christ has asked you to be humble. Where are the Christians who are humble? I would like to see - they are so arrogant. Christ went to the extreme of morality: "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." Let us see which Christians have that kind of eyes. Only the Sahaja yogis have those innocent eyes. 

You all are to be born again, you should have an actualization of baptism. You should feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost out of your fontanel bone area. We have had enough of sermons and lectures and Bible-reading. Let us read the book of reality, the book of reality. No blind faith is needed. You have to feel the all-pervading Power. You can prove it through Sahaja Yoga that Christ was the Son of God - you can prove it. They cannot prove. Can they give Self-realization? (You better take another hall and give address there. No one wants you. Just throw him out.) You should not believe blindly into anything whatsoever. You must have the proof of everything. If you don't have the proof, why do you believe in Bible, why do you believe in Gita, why do you believe in Koran, just blindly believing into it?

[Question.] (What did he say?)

I can treat her later on. We'll treat you, no doubt. It will take some time, better? We'll treat you, all right? Just now I want to give Self-realization to all of them. That is very important. They have come here to get their Self-realization. All right. 

(Ask them to give, give these boys some bandhans.)

I had to say it, I'm sorry. I had to say - the time had come to say this, see, so I'm happy.

Those who do not want to have Self-realization should please leave the hall. It is not civil to come to somebody else's meetings and disturb it. It is a divine work which is going on, and you have no business to disturb. So people are paid for this kind of work, I know; but why not seek your benevolence? Why stick onto these ideas and get ruined forever? There is no wisdom in this kind of blind faith. Now so many Muslims and Jews worship Christ, because it's a proof for them. It is not because they go to church and listen to someone, and then accept something. If it is a proof, then as honest people you have to accept. They say in English, proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, not by talking or by reading something. If you are hungry, you will get it; not those who are living on words and books. One poet has said in India - his name was Kabira - he said, by reading too much, even the educated have become stupid.

Now, as you know, there are two forces within us: what we call the left sympathetic and the right sympathetic nervous system. They work when we are in emergencies. But the third one is called as the parasympathetic, which supplies the energy to bring the whole system into balance. Actually the left side is the power of desire, and the right side is the power of action. Christ could not tell all these things, they crucified Him. This is the problem, that His work has to be completed. 

Now we will be using our left power of desire, expressing with your hand like this. But there are three conditions which you must have: that if you have pure desire to get your realization, then be sure that you all will get your Self-realization. You should now have no diffidence. (Let it be, doesn't matter. They are useless people, you see; they are paid by someone. You forget it now.)

So there are three conditions: first is, you should be confident that you will all get your Self-realization. All right. Then the second condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all. You have to forget the past. You have to be in the present. If you feel guilty, then you catch this center very badly, and as a result you develop even physical problems, apart from mental torture. You develop angina, spondylitis, and many diseases from the lethargic organs. All right. 

The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone, everyone in general; not to think about anyone who has troubled you. Even the gentleman who tried to disturb you: forgive him, just forgive. Because whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. So logically you must forgive. Actually you don't do anything. But why should we torture ourselves for others when they are enjoying themselves? And don't consider yourselves as anything low. Now you are a human being, and there's a last breakthrough that you have to achieve, which is the actualization of your baptism.

You have to take out your shoes for about ten minutes and put them, your feet, on the Mother Earth. 

... On your lap. This is suggestive that you are desirous of having your Self-realization. We'll tell you about the centers on the left-hand side which we'll be nourishing ourselves. Now please put your right hand on your heart, where resides the spirit. On the heart. Left side, left side. 

If the spirit shines in you, then it guides you; that's how you become your own master. So now please take down your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the center of your mastery. Now, here is the center made by all the prophets, which when enlightened, makes you the master of handling divine Power.

(Please sit down. Don't disturb us, at least. If you are Christians, sit down. Please don't disturb us. Sit down. Be humble, listen. Please be seated. At least behave like Christians.) 

Now, you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge, not bookish knowledge but pure knowledge which works, which works the divine Power; by which you give realizations to others, cure others, everything. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. Now, again on your heart. On your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. I have already told you that this center goes out of order when you feel guilty. Don't feel guilty at all.

Now, take your right hand and put it on your forehead across. Put down your head. Here you have to forgive everyone in general. Now, please take your hand back on the back side of your head, and push back your head. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction, "Oh divine Power, if I have done anything, please forgive me."

Now, please stretch your palm, and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, and press it down, your head. Push back your fingers so there's a good pressure. And now move your scalp slowly, seven times clockwise. Now, take down your hand. That's all we have to do. You can take out your spectacles because you have to close your eyes, and also if there's anything tight here or on your waist, please take it out.

Now again put your left hand towards Me, both the feet away from each other, and close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart. Here you ask Me a very fundamental question - you can call Me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji" - three times, "Mother, am I the spirit?" Ask this question three times. ... (Loudly.)

If you are the spirit, you are your master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, and ask Me another question - on the left-hand side - "Mother, am I my own master?"

I've already told you that I respect your freedom, and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So please take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. You have to ask for pure knowledge. So please say six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." ... (Loudly.) As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the kundalini, the reflection of the Holy Ghost, starts rising. 

Now please take your right hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We have to nourish these centers with our full confidence. Here you have to say with full confidence, "Mother, I am my own master."

I've already told you that the fundamental truth about you is that you are the pure spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego or these conditionings, but you are pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart, and with full confidence say, twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure spirit."

The divine Power is the power of compassion and love, it is the ocean of pure knowledge, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might commit, the ocean of forgiveness can dissolve it with its power. So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and put your head to your right. Here you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

I have already told you, logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you do not do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. So now raise your right hand to your forehead, and put down your head. Here from your heart, not how many times, say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head, and push back your head. Here you have to say, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction, "Oh divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me." Say it from your heart, not how many times. 

Now, stretch your palm, and please put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now bend your head. Push back your fingers to put a pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp slowly, seven times. But here again I cannot force Self-realization on you. I respect your freedom. So say seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization."

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

Now, please take down your hands. Please put your hands like this towards Me, and watch Me without thinking. Like this, like this. Now bend your head, and with the left hand see if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own head - you have to certify yourself. Don't put the hand on top of your head but away from it, and see for yourself. This is the proof. Now, please put the left hand towards Me, and put down your head again and see with the right hand. Some people get it far away also. Now with the right hand again. 

Now, please put both your hands towards the sky like this, and ask a question, one of those - one of these questions you ask, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Or second one, "Mother, is this the divine love of God?" Or "Mother, is it Ruh or Paramchaitanya?" Any one of these, you ask question three times.

Now please put down your hands. (They have got it!) Put down your hands, please. Like this you put it now. Those who have felt cool or hot breeze out of their fontanel bone, or on their hands or fingertips, please raise both your hands. 

This is the proof. May God bless you. Now you have become really Christians. Now you have become saints. This has to grow, your divinity has to grow. As I told you, it will grow in collectivity. We have here a very good center, and there are many people who know about Sahaja Yoga very well. You all should come, and become great Sahaja yogis. You have to save your fellow-men here; and you'll become masters in no time. You don't have to pay for anything. 

May God bless you. I would like to meet you people today, tonight, if possible. (Now, they should come up and .... )

(Don't talk with them. They are negative people.)
