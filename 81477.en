The keema she makes is really beautiful. Next thing, my husband used to work in Ealing, so Mother came to Ealing. One day, Subra was massaging Mother's feet, and Mother just sent a message to me: "Call Padmini, massage my other foot." So, Subra was massaging one side, and I was massaging the other. It was such a tremendous feeling. I really wanted to massage Mother's feet. And that day, such a feeling... really joyful. Massaging Mother's feet, feeling all the vibrations just go in your heart.

For about thirteen minutes, we just chatted with each other about this and that. When she picked up the phone, I didn't say "Jai Shri Mataji"â€”nothing. It was just like talking to a friend.

The next day, I went to Pratishtan. John and I walked in, and I think she came forward. She said to John, "Sorry I didn't tell you, but your wife already phoned and told me." She just looked at me, and it was just so innocent. Sometimes I think, "Shri Mataji, you are really Adi Shakti," and I was just talking with Her. Now, I think about how I talked to Shri Mataji. She is always Adi Shakti. And when Shri Mataji, before...
