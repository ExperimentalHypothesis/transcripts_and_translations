Shivaratri Puja. Sahaja Yoga Temple, Delhi (India), 11 February 1983.

I am happy that you all have adjusted yourselves in this small space. When there is love and understanding, little space can occupy many hearts. But, when there is no large heart then whatever one may get it is never sufficient. 
Today, we are going to worship Shiva Tattva within us, principle of Shiva. For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important, because Shiva is the ultimate we have to achieve. Shiva is represented in our Spirit, so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim of everything else. The rest of it is all created, like Vishnu tattva and Brahmadeva, just to create human beings, to evolve them and then ultimately lead them to Shiva. That’s the ultimate. 

But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva’s tattvas that even to get into Vishnu tattva is difficult. They get into, involved into the five elements which have created us that is the outermost being within us. All the chakras have the outermost, we can say, just the vessel. But the desire to be the Spirit is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga. So we have to see inward towards ourselves as Sahaja Yogis: do we have that desire entirely? Or we have still many desires hanging around?

See the greatest problem is of the Nabhi chakra, whether it is in the east or the west. Some people still have hankering for the baser search of food, which is very surprising, even in Sahaja Yoga, of Nabhi chakra. Then, still some people have sense of possessions and money quite a lot. And subtler and subtler they grow, still the detachment doesn’t develop within them. It becomes subtler. As you grow subtler, the attachment becomes subtler and difficult to get out, specially people who come up as leaders in Sahaja Yoga or closer to Sahaja Yoga are always under attack. They are attacked maybe by their husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, sons, children – something like that. And that makes it worse because all such leaders who are attacked, try to displease all the deities by small things here and there. The whole behaviour has to be understood that you have become a subtler person and you are rising higher, so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you. Always the front line is under attack, not the back line. So those who are in the front are always under attack and they have to be very careful as to how they are behaving. For if there is a sly person, he will become sly, but subtler sly. He will not just become the other way round. His slyness will become subtler. If he is a miserly fellow, then he will become miserly in a subtler way. Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow, then he become ego-oriented in a subtler way.

But to get rid of these things within you, you have to go to the other side of it. Say if you are miserly, become absolutely generous, give up everything that you have, don’t be calculating, don’t talk of money, don’t worry about money. If you are extravagant, indulgent too much, you should go the other way round. Unless and until you become juxtaposition, you cannot get rid of these things. Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered, then become so mild that even if somebody beats you, it’s all right, whatever one says it’s all right. That’s how you get rid of your habits which become subtler and subtler.

There’s another way of dealing with it: being alert. When you are alert, you start seeing yourself as a separate person with the habits that it has, and then you start understanding why you are behaving: “Oh I understand, I knew you before, ten years back, before my Realisation. I know mister you are like this”. And then take a juxtaposition against that personality and just shoot it off. Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person. Whatever you may do for that person, he will become subtler and subtler. Suddenly, if it’s a girl, she will start just crying for nothing at all and feeling miserable. If it’s a boy, if he thinks about, analyses, he’ll become analyser of Sahaja Yoga also, in a subtler way. Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph and see the reflection, that’s the other one who died. And just try to make fun of that or shout at it, depends on. If it is an aggressive stuff, it’s better to make fun, because it’s stupid. And if it is the one who takes aggression, then shout at it: “what do you mean by it?” taking aggression like this.
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality. Your being has to be cleansed. With your help only I can do it. Many people say: “Mother, You are all powerful.” All right, I am and I can do everything. But only thing I cannot surpass your freedom. That’s a fact. I cannot cross over your freedom. And when I cannot cross your freedom, you have to cross that. If in your own freedom, you come inside, then I will bestow upon you all the blessings. But if you want to stand outside I am not the one to put you in with a pistol. No, that’s not the way it will work out. This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must know that at every moment you are free, and freer, and freest. The more free you become, the worse is your situation as far as the facing of the negativity is concerned. 

Say there are four persons around you. They will be first attacked. Naturally you can understand the front line is always under attack, not the back side. Though according to the law, it should be the back side because all these horrible negative forces should come from the back. But they are very clever. They know that the back sometimes drop off by themselves; there is no need to go that side. They try the front line. And those who think they are in charge and responsible have to be very careful as to how they behave, how they are responsible, how they work it out. If they are keeping their old habits at a subtler level or they are just fighting it. It’s very important. And this is how intelligently you can manage yourselves very well.
Then once you become detached, go from all these things, only at mental level. The spiritual level I’ll look after but at mental level, you must come to logical conclusion that: “I have to fight this nonsensical stuff. I have to be alert about this nonsense that exists within me.”

Shiva tattva is innocent, absolutely innocent it is. He’s very powerful and extremely innocent. And the secret to achieve it, is only just to please, just please Him. If you please Shiva, then he may be a rakshasa or anything, He grants all kinds of boons. But to a rakshasa, He can only grant the boon of longevity, of long life. But to a saint, He’ll grant the Satchitananda state. 
So even if He grants anything to a rakshasa, one should not ask questions about it. He can give you longevity – what does it matter, even if he lives for thousands of years and earn nothing out of it? You never get your Realization. So to a saint, He gives that eternal longevity which comes through Spirit. This is the blessing of Shiva tattva. While Vishnu tattva, He gives ascent to a saint and light of wisdom to see and understand everything in collective consciousness. And to a rakshasa, He gives death, He kills. So for people who are not so deep, it seems that why should Shiva give any blessings of longevity to a rakshasa? These are the characters of these different deities. Now for example, if a rakshasa wants to live long, he goes to Shiva, pleases Him by praising Him, singing songs to Him, by asking His blessings, by doing tapas for Him, talking about Shiva’s innocence – he gets longevity. Sometimes, these rakshasas are better on the earth than in the subconscious. They can be horrid. They can gather some more bhoots to torture human beings. So it’s better to keep them in the eyes of Vishnu. He manages them better here than to send them into the subconscious.

But Shiva’s style is very different from that of Vishnu’s style. You have to have all kinds of styles because you know there are so many permutations and combinations in human beings. If you have one style, what will you do with the other style of human beings? So the style of Vishnu is that if you are trying to be funny, He plays tricks and puts you right. Say, a Sahaja Yogi – He is not interested – Vishnu – so much interested in other people, but in Sahaja Yogis. If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny; say he wants to drink wine, all right, He says, “Drink wine.” He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick somewhere, his car falls off, or he is insulted somewhere. Something happens to him, he is punished so badly that he says, “Oh God, what have I done?” That’s Vishnu tattva.

But Shiva is the other way round. If you see Shiva’s style is this; that if you drink, He just disappears from your heart. You have a heart attack and you die. He also kills. One kills directly in a positive way, He definitely kills; the another one by recession. If Shiva disappears, how can you exist, that’s one way. Second way is that, those who are born with Shiva tattva – like our Sainath was – Shirdi Sainath, or people like that; even the Devi sometimes can do that. They drink away all the wines of the world, all the poisons of the world. Like Shiva did that.

So when Sainath found that so many people were smoking this tobacco, he smoked all the tobacco of the world. He tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra so that nobody should get it. That’s the style of Shiva to take all the poison into Himself. And to absorb all the poison within Himself. He can deal with the most difficult things; so the one dealing comes through the brain. Because Virata is in our brain, acts through the brain. So He plays tricks on you. And that appeals to us because we can see that He’s killed someone. So we think ‘very nice Mother, You have punished that person’.

But Shiva tattva gives you the problems which normally you cannot see, but works out in a short time like that. Like heart troubles or a person who has  very poor Shiva tattva can have all the incurable diseases of the world. There nobody is killed, but every minute the person is suffering. That is the way Shiva corrects.

In us when Shiva tattva is awakened our priorities change absolutely. I see now that those who have come, say, to India from the west have changed quite a lot in their priorities, but still there is not so much change as it should be. They’re of course thousand times better than their fellow beings who are not realised souls. But still, attachment to things, attachment to money is quite a lot. This detachment must work out. See things are not correct in people and the alertness is not there.

To give a very, very gross example of this is, I will tell you that, a gentleman, say, came and he was told that you have to give, say, 11 rupees for puja. He said, “On principle we are not supposed to give.” So I mean, you are only paying even on principle you are only paying for your food and lodging, not for puja. The other side of it they will not even see that Mother is spending so much for us extra for which we are not paying. It’s not all found. Like the other day, I said that people are now asking Me to pay for this, now tomorrow they will say pay for our house rents. It was so.

It was such a condition, once upon a time in London when I started the ashram. That they asked for all the utensils in the ashram, I paid for the rent, paid for everything. (Shri Mataji laughing) Ultimately they said we don’t have an ironing board, please send us. From that, it’s not so bad now, I mean, of course. But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees for taxi, they will think that, “Oh we have to pay for taxi – Mother is supposed to pay.” But if I have to pay 7000 – 8000 rupees for you to go to Haridwar, that’s all right. That’s good. That nobody wants to find out, how Mother is paying for us.

It’s surprising and this disturbs Me very much that what is your attitude towards things. The pleasing should be done with full heart. Say if you want to buy any presents for your friends, or anything, you don’t mind spending money for that. But for puja you have objections. For your laundry you used to pay always, I mean I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed how much money was spent. But 21 Rupees, the principle was involved, imagine. Look at it. If you look at it, you will be shocked at yourselves. That shows despite all this, you have got your realization. See the generosity. It’s very, very – you see, it’s very gross. It’s very gross. So the detachment from this gross life must go away.

But an ordinary villager understands better because he is innocent. He is innocent. Because you are not innocent. That’s why you see everything from your mind. You think too much. How much have we paid, how much this is, this that, this that. But an innocent villager even if he has four annas, he would like to do something, “Mother – that’s all I have.” We have a parable in the Bible. And this is what it is. One should see our detachment starts at the very baser level of money. You need not have any friends, what is the need to give  to any friends? What are these friends for? Except for Shiva tattva, what other friend you need? Think of it, without God, what is your life?

So the detachment must start. The priorities must change and you must know that God is the One who is your Friend, who is your Father, who is your Mother, who is to be worshipped, there is nothing else. Tana, mana, dhana, everything is for God. Of course, I don’t want anything from you, you know that. But that should be the attitude of a person.

So the first – this attitude comes in a person. Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great advantage that those who have developed this attitude have been helped so much materially that you find the proof of it immediately. The proof is there and those who do not take to this kind of a thing suffer. So the proof is there.

I must give you an example of a – goldsmith. I had given him something to be made for the Puja. A lot of gold was given, everything. And still, stupidly, he tried to make money out of that. And he got cancer and he died. I didn’t do anything. But I knew he had made money, I knew that all. I know lots of things, I didn’t say anything to him, nothing, never – never even mentioned. He got cancer and he died, he is no more. Because Shiva tattva disappeared. This was for a puja, the money of the saints, something was to be made and he should not have done it. The proof is just there. Now, those who knew him got a fright of their lives, “Oh God, now no more of this from us at least.”

But those who have been surrendered about their money part also, not that I take anything from them nor I want anything from you. But, still the attitude I am saying is different, they have gone out, they have made money, they are very rich, they are very well to do, they are all right. They get so much blessings – everything. This is the first Nabhi chakra’s detachment.  We should start by putting Shiva out.

Every attachment can be attacked with Shiva tattva because Shiva tattva is brilliant like a diamond, brilliant. Every facet can be cleansed out, very simply through our Kundalini awakening and through our alertness and what after that you can see there are other attachments we have. This is friendship, sympathies, friendships. Sympathies always go to a person who is in need or something like that. You have no sympathies, have tortured so many people. The other way also could be that you hate someone too much, you love someone too much, some sort of a thing like that. So detachment comes that you do not hate nor you love anyone. You leave it to God to decide. That’s the kind of a detachment that you leave it to God. God, please that’s His decision. I am not going to judge. Only thing I judge them on Kundalini and I awaken their kundalini. If it works out well and good, if it doesn’t work out, all right.

So you have detached yourselves, from the responsibility of judging others. Only your judgement is on Kundalini, if it works out, all right. But, you are just like a barometer that’s all, or like a machine that cures. You are not involved into it. So this involvement into personal lives and personal relationships like mother, sister, brother every sort of a nonsense must be taken up. Now say, if your mother is not all right, you must just get after her and see that she is put right. That’s very important, mother has to be all right. If she’s not all right, then you tell her, “I’m not going to eat food from your hand”, finished. You get your vibrations, all right. You tell her that “You better take to realisation otherwise I will not have anything to do with you. I’ll just  see, talk to you and go away.” Show that detachment to her. Be strong. You must cure your mother. Very important because mother is a part of Sahaja Yoga, it’s very important. But many people I have seen just do not know how to resist. You must protest; go on protesting one after another because that’s the greatest thing you are doing for your mother. What else can you give it to her? Anything you give the whole world has no meaning except correcting your mother for the better life, an eternal life, life of God.

Then your wife –  wife is a very dangerous situation. If your wife is negative, she will go on putting into your head things which will work out at a odd time and you will be amazed how you slipped out these things and how you said these things. Why should you have done it, why did you do this. But the wife is to be told that, “You have to behave yourself, you have to get all right, nothing doing. And there is no compromise. You be in another room, I will be in another room. You should get well. I am not going to help.” Because that is even much more dangerous because you know if the woman is catching then there are very serious diseases you develop with the Mooladhara problem. So you have to be strict with your wife. You should make her. You should tell her, “I’ll not eat any food with your hands. I’ll have nothing to do, I’ll not talk to you, I’ll just come and sleep in another room and go away. You better not touch my clothes. If you don’t listen to me then I have nothing to do with you – I’m your husband. Whatever dharma I follow you have to follow me, if you don’t want to listen to me, then I have nothing to do with you.”

The wife can also do the same with the husband. Gradually showing indifference in a way that he understands that it doesn’t bring love. That’s how women corrected men long time back. Nowadays, of course women, if you give them something, they  get pleased. Even if there is a keep, as long as they are giving diamonds to the wife she is quite pleased with the keep. Still in India it’s not accepted. But I have seen in the west nobody minds, if the husband has ten keeps doesn’t matter as long as he is giving you the money, all right, nobody minds it. That’s very funny.

So wife’s relation, mother’s relation, husband’s relations, close relations must be corrected.

Now children must be guarded. You shouldn’t allow your children to go away to the wrong things. If they are doing wrong things, they are not coming to Sahaja Yoga, you are duty bound; you should say, I’m not going to pay you any money, nothing doing. I’ll not see your faces, if you do not take to Sahaja Yoga. What else are you going to give to your children, but God?

You can do it. All can do it. But one should know I need not do it. So many people say that, “Mother, Your husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi.” It’s all right. I know where to bring him in; I know when to bring My children in; because if they were in everybody would have said, “They have floated a family enterprise.” (Laughter)

As long as they are out of it, it’s a very good idea – specially in India. So best thing is if they oppose Me, I keep all of them out, My brothers. Imagine My own brothers, My own – I mean, they all have tremendous respect for Me, no doubt. Even My brother said that, “Thank God You are staying in my room now, so the vibrations will be very good for me. What do You think of my vibrations?” Everything he says, but he is not a Sahaja Yogi. I have given realisation to all of them, everything is there, but they are not Sahaja Yogis – a part of this. Otherwise they will be in charge of money, you see. What money you get. Now come along this is the money we have, all problems. With all these relations around, you don’t know. Somebody will go and say, “Shri Mataji said so.” “Oh, that’s the daughter of Mataji has said so.” – That becomes. I don’t want all these pressures on My head.

That’s the best way; I wish these our politicians understand that; never have your relations around. That’s the best way to administer. If you have your relations around, then you will never do right things. Or even if you do right things, your relations will spoil it.

So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know that you should not try to help your relations in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja Yoga. Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi, then you bring your mother and make her sit in front of Me. First correct her vibrations, put her right and then bring her. Correct my father, correct my mother is not Mother’s responsibility, it’s your own. When they are all right, then as you bring flowers to Me, bring your relations as a very good present from your family. That’s a much better thing than to be like this that I have to clear. If one is a Sahaja Yogi, all his three generations up and down, this side and that side have to cure that is done. Like Mehrotra (name of a sahaja yogi) made Me do.

So one should detach from these family ties and these emotional imbalances we have, emotional problems we have by understanding that the only thing that these people should have is Sahaja Yoga. And some people should not be in Sahaja Yoga like as I said – My own husband, and My daughters and My relations, I keep them out. All such people if there are any, you should not also have them anywhere near Sahaja Yoga. You should be discrete to find out.

Although, all these, My relations are very dharmic people, extremely dharmic, very good. Very self-respecting, all qualities they have got – everything. Ready made, but they are not in Sahaja Yoga. So none of you can say so-body said so, so one said so. It has to be Mother has to say.

This detachment has to come, it takes time. Especially with Indians, all the time they are worried about their children, mother or father goes on and on and on and on and on. See years together, my son, my daughter, my son, my father – all the time. Now by God’s grace so many have got rid of all their responsibilities somehow, through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is, (Shri Mataji laughing) so they are now they have settled down with themselves, because you have your own responsibility. So this detachment must be brought those who are coming to Sahaja Yoga, that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga blessings. We are going to be blessings, with that pride. You should be in the family, all right. If you want to have Sahaja Yoga, you have it. But not to force them on Sahaja Yoga, but you can force Sahaja Yoga on them, the stage has come that you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga to them. In the beginning I used to say, “Don’t talk to them.” But those who are useless, if they are not to be brought in Sahaja Yoga, tell them, “You are not good for Sahaja Yoga, better not ask.” Then they will come. Some people you should show complete indifference, “you are incapable, you are no good, you are too materialistic.” Then that person would say, “I will prove that I am” (Laughter)

All these detachments take place and then the detachments are at Nabhi, Nabhi chakra’s, you rise up to your emotional side in your Heart chakra. And then you have to have the detachment even of a kind of a collectivity that we think is collectivity. I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not collectivity. Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group and they will have a very strong objection to everything that is sensible. And they will have suggestions for everything. There has to be no suggestions at all. There are no alternatives, because Shiva is absolute. Once what is said is said, you just do it and see – that’s the best. Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless. But there is no alternative for Shiva tattva.

I’ll give an example, I told Delhi people that you organise say, program for seven days outside with other people. It was sensible because I knew it was to rain. It has to rain also. Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see. We cannot stop it only for Sahaja Yogis. Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important so I said, “Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis.” Now they started an alternative, only thinking, that you see they won’t be comfortable. And I mean it was good, but on a other level that they will not be comfortable with Sahaja Yogis, another level. But there has to be understanding if Mother has said it, it must be done – whatever it is. Even if She says, “You kill somebody”, you have to kill. Keep it like that – to that extent. Keep to the maximum, even if She says, “You have to die”, you should die. If She says, “All right, you tell lies.” Go on, “I’ll tell lies.”

Like Radhaji, She said, “What is my punyas, what is my papas(sins). I’m in His heart. What can I do, whatever He tells Me I do.” – That is Shiva tattva.

When it is awakened you see it at least recognises Shiva in Me. And it sees that this is Shiva tattva. It understands because at Shiva tattva you don’t commit any sins, you are sinless. When you are the Spirit, you are sinless; there is no sin in you. If – supposing according to human understanding if Shiva leaves, a person dies, then it’s sinful. Why to leave anybody. It’s sinful, isn’t it? For all common purposes, common understanding will think it is sinful for Shiva to leave the person and make the person die. For example, a lady dies, her children are left behind, then one can blame Shiva for that – that, “See now You went away and these children are now without a mother or without a father”, or something like that.

Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does is sinless. So whatever you do is sinless – the idea of sin is finished because who commits sin is your ego. Ego commits sin. But if you have no ego, there’s no sin because you are not doing anything. You stand in Akarma(not the doer). Say the sun is shining and shining sharp and somebody wants to stand in the sun then he gets burns. It’s not the fault of the sun, the sun is shining – that’s the job of sun. Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is doing it. He’s not sinful. It’s our mental attitude makes us think, this is sin, this is not sin. But when we have ego, we are committing sins.

If you ask a tiger, “You are committing a sin because you are eating a cow?” He will say, “I never knew what a sin was. I don’t know what sin is.” It’s a story when some missionaries were going away from a village, you see. So the villagers – poor, innocent villagers, they got up to thank them. They said, “Thank God, when you came here you told us there is sin. We didn’t know what sin was.” (Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter)

Innocent people, they don’t know what is sin. Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin. It obeys the other source of innocence. So there is no sin for a person who is the spirit. For Shiva, there is no sin whether He wants to give His blessings to a rakshasa or to a saint. There is no sin for Him because He is bholenath(Lord of Innocents - one of the names of Shiva). He is beyond sin. Whatever He does, He is beyond sin because ego cannot envelope Him. There is no ego. Because we have ego we commit sins. Once ego is finished we are no more there, so who commits sins? When we are not there, who is committing the sin? Shiva can’t commit sins, so we are the Shiva; so we cannot commit sins.

So all these ideas of giving alternatives at the mental level is also wrong. I give – anything I say, immediately there will be ten suggestions. I try all these tricks with you. Because you are used to conferences, you see. (Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter) So I said, “All right, Subramanian( a sahaja yogi from Delhi), what do you have to say about it?” Because after all, Lord Subramanian(a sahaja yogi from Delhi) is there. Must ask him. Then I ask Venugopalan(a sahaja yogi from Delhi), then I’ll ask Gavin,Waaren; all these people. Now what do you have to say? And then they give their suggestions.

But if you see in the conference of all the Divine Deities, there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative. No alternatives to your Mother’s ideas, nothing. Absolute. It’s absolute. Nobody gives any suggestions to Me; never. No question. They won’t listen to you, they won’t listen to anyone. There’s no question. Such harmony; complete obedience. And not only they are fixed with their qualities. They are told that you have to do it, they’ll do it. This is the difference. They try. Sometimes it appears, you see. If I say all right, go this way and you will find the place but you won’t find. So then you will say, ‘See Mother You said to go this and that’s why we went this way and we didn’t find the church.’ Now there it is not that I’m saying that you will find the church, it is I am trying to see what you think.

I am telling you My own tricks, all right, so be careful. (Laughter) I’ll tell you all, go this way, now you didn’t find the church, I’m sorry. I should not have told you. Or you shouldn’t have gone that way. But that’s not true. I must tell you, that’s not true. What I’m trying to see what you are saying about this. Now if you are clever, you would say, “I went there, I didn’t see the place, but I saw something else. Mother, that’s the reason You sent me there. Now I know why You sent me there.” That’s it. Then I know he is Sahaja Yogi. But if you say, ‘Oh I went there because I thought I will find this thing, but, it was not there, and You sent me, You sent me. (Laughter) Finished. If you say that, You said so and it happened or I did say, no doubt. But what I said was just to play a little trick on you. Because one of the natures of your Mother is Mahamaya; so be careful. How you react is very important for Me to see how far you have gone. This is one of the ways you are judged. But for a villager, it’s a different thing if you see. If I tell him, now if you want me  to go to that village you see  take the cart, or take the bullock cart this way; he will take it. But there will be a ditch. So I’ll get hit. So he will say Mother,I am sorry, you got hit. But I could have avoided it. You see. So he takes the responsibility upon himself. He takes everything upon himself. Because you asked Me so I have to go that way but I could have avoided it if I was careful .

So this is the difference you know, not to put responsibility. It’s a common human nature is to put responsibility on somebody else. Best is to put on Mother. (Shri Mataji laughing) But in that you lose all your punyas.

So the responsibility is mine, I must have done some mistake. I must have done some mistake somewhere or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn something in this. Every time you do something, I tell you something, it’s just for you to learn something. I don’t have to learn anything. If you think that way that I have to learn something now anymore. So you have to learn something. And that is what if you understand; then a kind of a detachment will build in you and a surrender. You will be amazed that you will be so much relieved of nonsensical headaches that you have and the burdens you carry. If you understand that the whole joke, the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother and I am just playing into it. It’s so simple. That is to be felt, to be understood. And the enjoyment lies in that. Not in judging or finding alternatives. You try it. Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much. And so many things. Every minute, I’ll give you an example of that.

I’ll give you an example of Gregoire; last time I went to his house. He tortured My life for his wife. When will she have her delivery, how will she have, who is going to stay with her? Morning till evening, he had one talk. All right, I said, “Something will be done. You can have this lady to stay with you.” And then, “How will I go to India?” I mean, “I” was so important. Then he didn’t realise it at that time, he thought it was so important to do that. Ultimately quite before going I told him, “Gregoire, you troubled Me too much this time. But it’s all right.” Then he said, “I’m sorry.” Then he telephoned Me one day saying, “Mother, my wife is in for abortion. She has gone to the hospital, there is no chance.” I said, “Forget it. You go back to the hospital, she will be all right.” He went to the hospital and he said, “It’s a miracle. She’s perfectly all right, there’s no problem. She’s all right.”

So it came into his head, as he told Me. Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should I worry. Why should I worry? This is first thing. Then, the child was born earlier than time. And he came to Me. So also I convinced him, what I say, what I do, you know that. That I look after you. But when you took up responsibility upon yourself and start thinking about it, then I cannot help. So just know that leave it to God. It’s all for your good, for your ‘hitta’(benevolence). Everything is for your ‘hitta’. Whatever it is, sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes I have to correct you, sometimes I have to tell you that, “Don’t come here.”

Some people who touch Me, you see, can give me horrible sensations, then I say, “You just don’t come here. You don’t stand before Me, get out from here.” That helps them. But if they stand there, the bhoots will never leave because the bhoots want to trouble Me.

So this point if you understand, you will get completely detached and will know that for our good, for our betterment we must keep Mother pleased and these things if we do by displeasing Her, we are going to be finished.

Now to understand this, what you need – not age, not position, not your qualifications, nothing – you need a wise mind. Deep personality. I’ve seen very young people are so sensible; their parents are stupid, absolutely stupid people. So you just need a wise, deep personality to do it and that you should try to develop. That comes only sticking on to Shiva tattva, which is a solid thing, which is Shiva ‘achala,, which doesn’t move, absolute. It is not relative, it’s not relative at all – it’s not related to anything, absolute. That gives you the depth. That depth which is required to settle down, to go deep.

Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that gives you the gravity to go straight down, deep into it.

Hindi – Remove the child from front. Child is mentally imbalanced. Isn’t it? Is he all right? Make him sit silently.

That is very important. And all this I hope with the puja today we’ll try to settle you into that great principle of Shiva. Let your attention, every particle of your attention be filled, sparkled and rejoiceby that blessing of Shiva tattva. I bless you all!

So to begin with, we are going to worship the Devi first of all, and then the Shiva.

[HINDI]

Avahanam means we have to establish Shri Ganesha. That is important. And then, after that we have to say the names of Vishnu, whatever – because these names have to be said which are the ascending names.

And after that we will be having the location and everything described where we are doing it, why we are doing it, the puja. Then we’ll worship Devi. We take 108 names of the Devi. I think you all should remember these 108 names by heart. Have you got it printed – the Devi’s names? Have you got copies? You have got them? Have you got these with you? You have booklet?
