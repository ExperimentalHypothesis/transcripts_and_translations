I bow to you all who are seekers of Truth! (Shri Mataji bow to the audience with folded hands)

But first of all, we have to know what is the truth. What is the Absolute? In our evolutionary process, we have got human awareness. We have also got the freedom to form our own ideas, mental ideas as to what the Truth is. But Truth cannot be known through human awareness. One has to become a subtler personality. All this knowledge that we have outside, has created a civilization which is like a big tree. But we have to find out about the roots which are going to nourish this civilization. if you do not know the absolute Truth you commit mistakes and any kind of ideas, any kind of mental projections, any kind of mental ideologies ultimately (unclear) because it has to be substantiated by reality.

And what is the Reality? The reality is that you are not only this body, this mind, this intellect, this ego, or this conditioning but you are the pure Spirit. The another thing is that we take all living work for granted. For example, we take all these flowers for granted without finding out how a seed has become a flower. And also of different types. There are so many things in our body, physical body medically cannot be explained. One of them is that a human body always throws whatever is faulty. But when a child is conceived the fetus there, it is nourished, retained, and looked after and thrown out at a proper time.

Everything, for example, the mango tree grows up to a certain level a rose plant grows up to a certain level they do not cross the limits. Every animal has it's limits too. So, what is that energy which does all this work? The energy that nourishes us, looks after us, gives us a balance, what is that energy? This energy resides in the Mother Earth, resides in the Sun, resides everywhere, and how it works through those elements. It definitely exists but we have never felt it before.

When I am talking to you, you have to keep your mind open as a scientist and see for yourself whatever I am saying, is truth or not. If it is true then you have to accept it. As true and honest people you have to develop it also.

Now, if I say that every human being even these sweet children are extremely potential and they are capable of taking great dynamic lives, but there is a little problem. Like this instrument I am using (Shri Mataji is showing the mike she is holding) if it is not connected to the mains, it is useless. In the same way, unless and until we are connected to this divine love, the energy of divine love we are not full of ourselves, our manifestation is not complete. All our glory, all our beauty, all our dynamism, all our compassion is limited. We get easily frustrated, we get easily disappointed and we feel this life is really a misery.

I have come here to give you a message that human life once enlightened is the highest life in the whole universe. It is no use describing this mechanical thing that you see here (it seems as if Shri Mataji is pointing towards the subtle system chart which is not visible) Best thing is that you take your realization, You feel this divine power and then you know yourself what this mechanism is and what's the technique.

As the kundalini rises, she passes through subtle centres which cater to your physical, emotional, and mental side. and ultimately it makes your spirit shine into your attention. And then this spirit which is in your attention, makes your attention so powerful that wherever you put your attention it acts, acts for benevolence for your being, for your fellow being, and for the whole world.

It acts in such a way that it understands everything, it knows everything, and it also has the trick, how to work it out. And the Spirit is a collective being within us. Like the sun can reflect on everything but if the reflector is like a stone, it doesn't show it's reflection. But once if you are realized, then you start reflecting the Spirit and all the qualities of the Spirit start manifesting by itself through you.

The first quality of the Spirit is that you become collectively conscious. That means your awareness widens, you see other dimensions by which you can feel on your fingertips your centres and centres of others. If only you know how to correct these centres then you can help yourself and you can help everyone.

Spirit is the source of peace. Even if we talk of peace, people have foundations of peace but there is no peace within themselves. So, a person who is guided by the spirit emits, emits peace.

And Spirit is the source of power. You become so powerful that no habit can overpower you. I have seen people giving up drugs and alcoholism overnight.

Spirit is the source of wisdom. Even small children who sometimes you find are very difficult and troublesome and misguided by schools, once they get you enlightened they become extremely wise children. The sense of respect comes to them because they respect themselves.

The Spirit is the source of knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have about anything is very superficial.

Once I was travelling in Kashmir and I felt tremendous vibrations of this divine power. And I knew there was somebody who must have lived here who must be a great man. So, I asked the driver to take me to the way from where the vibrations were coming. And guess what? There was complete wilderness throughout. and very poor people living there. I asked them is there any saint who lived here? They said no, but there is a little thing kept here! One hair of Hazrat Mohammed Saheb!! Now I got it five miles away!

But whatever knowledge we have through self-realization is the absolute, real knowledge. Otherwise, the way people follow Mohammad saheb, we are surprised how can they be. The way they follow Christianity you can't believe. The way they follow Hinduism you can't believe that they have any faith in something good. They are all capable of doing any kind of bad thing or committing any kind of sins, all of them. So, they have no knowledge. They are blind. Unless and until your eyes are opened out and you see the knowledge, if you believe in anything it's

blind faith. And blind faith leads you to destruction. It becomes like an addiction and the person goes on destroying himself till the whole community is destroyed.

So, whatever may be the human philosophies, ideologies, or anything, unless and until you have the sense of reality within you, you are following it blindly. But you all should be very knowledgeable. You all should know each and everything about yourself and others. You all can learn and understand the problems of our society and how to solve them. And you can judge yourself very well also because you can feel yourself. You can feel your centres.

Today when I came, somebody told me, Mother! My agnya is catching very much! That means actually that I have become very egoistical, but he confesses and he says, Mother! Just clear this agnya and I'll be alright because I have got a headache with this!

But without realization, if you tell somebody you have an ego he will hit you. So, when we say this is my hand, these are my feeling or this is my intelligence, we always say the relationship 'my' but what is I? That we don't know! That I is the Spirit! This starts manifesting, it has so many benevolent qualities that in one lecture I think I cannot describe them, but that's all potential within you. And if the divine power of love awakens it, you get what you want.

So, we have to just say that we want to be the Spirit because this Kundalini is the power of pure desire because all other desires are impure. You want today to buy a car then you want to have a house. You go on like that. They are never satisfied. So, the pure desire is to be one with that Divine power and is only possible when you become the Spirit.

Today I request you all to bring your questions tomorrow. I will try to answer because there are so many people, properly written down. But even if I answer your questions, it doesn't mean you'll get your realization, there is no guarantee. There is no lecturing necessary for raising the Kundalini because it's a living process. Like we don't lecture to the Mother Earth and seed when it has to sprout. So, this living process has to take place and happens spontaneously. So, Sahaj yoga means with you is 'sah', ' ja' means born, with you is born, is the right to have yoga, means union with this divine power.

So, this is how it has to work out and this is the only thing that is going to transform the whole world.

Now, we are working in forty nations and you'll be surprised what beautiful life Sahaj yogi have. They treat each other with such love, with such understanding and there is never a quarrel. If there is a person who is trying to exploit, he just gets out of Sahaj yoga, he is exposed. But then again he can work it out and come back. But when you ascend you have to be careful because the more you ascend the worst is to fall.

So, let us have our self-realization and enjoy ourselves. Is it alright? (Audience applause while Shri Mataji smiles and bow to them)

(Unclear) and some Germans have come here. Also, there are some English, some Indians, and Muslims. You can take out your ( the video is cut)

And now put your right hand on your heart and close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question to me. You can call me Shri Mataji or mother. Now, with full confidence, you ask a question three times to me. Mother! Am I the spirit? In your heart. Now, if you are the spirit then you are your master you are your guide.

So, now please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We are working only on the left-hand side. Here, now you have to ask another question to me. Mother, am I my own master? three times.

Again I am saying, I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it in your own freedom. So, now please take down your rights hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now here ask me six times, Mother! please give me pure knowledge! Six times because this centre has got six petals. When you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising upward. So, we have to nourish the upper chakras, centres with our self-confidence.

So, now please put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and say with full confidence over the centre, Mother! I am my own master!

I am already told you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions, you are not this ego or conditionings. You are pure Spirit. So, now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, Mother! I am the Spirit!

So, now raise your right hand on the corner of your neck and shoulder. All the divine power is the power of love, is the ocean of compassion. It is the ocean of knowledge and ocean of joy. It is the ocean of benedictions. So, you should not feel guilty at all because whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved completely, completely by this power of compassion and bliss. So, turn your head to your right and say sixteen times, Mother! I am not guilty at all! This is the one centre you have so please do not feel guilty.

I told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive you do not do anything. But if you don't forgive you play into the wrong hands and you torture yourself. Those who want to torture you are happy people while you go on suffering.

So, please take your right hand on your forehead and put it across. Please press it on both the sides of your forehead and put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, from your heart not how many times. Mother, I forgive everyone! In general, you have to forgive not to each and every person.

Now please take your right hand at the back of your head and push back your head as far as possible on it. Now here you have to say for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes say, Oh! all-pervading power if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me.

Now you have to stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on your fontanelle bone area. Now, please bend down your head, new press your scalp by pushing out your fingers outwards. Please put down your head. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for self-realization. I cannot force it on you. So, now you put your right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area properly and push back your fingers nicely and put down your head and now move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise by saying Mother, please give me my self-realization! Put down your head! Push back your fingers! Push back your fingers! Shri Mataji blows in the microphone seven times.

Now, please take down your hands and put them towards me. Now watch me without thinking.

Open your eyes and watch me without thinking.

Now, please put your right hand towards me. And put down your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Some people will get it hot some people will get it cool. First, the heat has to go out. Now, also don't touch your head. Keep it away. Some people get it very far away from the head. Put down your head properly. Now, please put your left hand towards me and put down your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

Now, please put your right hand towards me again and see with your left hand if you are feeling the cool breeze. Bend your head! Please don't touch your head. Take it away from the head. Now, again with the left hand, you see if there is a cool breeze.

Now, please raise both your hands towards the sky and push back your head like this. Now, ask me a question, one of the questions. Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the all-pervading power? Mother, is this the paramchaitnya? Ask any question three times. Put your head up like that.

May God bless you! Thank you very much! (Unclear, a very huge crowd of the audience is seen with both their hands up in the air)

Please come here tomorrow and I'll tell you how to protect yourself, how to know yourself, and how to know others. (Unclear)
