奉献和虔诚的重要 

英国伦敦1982年8月6日

今天,我要告诉你们,在霎哈嘉瑜伽里奉献的重要,以及霎哈嘉瑜伽士应有的虔诚。

当我们很靠近一座山的时候,我们看不见这座山的大部分,不知道身处如此庞大体积的东西,我们不知道面前这伟大。这是一种幻相在起作用,令人们不能在思维层面上知道他们为何会存在,知道他们身处哪里、他们找到了什么、自觉是什么、自觉的高度有多少、他们需要走多远、他们为何会被拣选、他们的生命有何意义、他们升进了多少、他们能够明白到什么程度。所有这些事情都超越了人们所能理解的范围,人们因而感震惊。当人得到自觉之后,他不知道究竟有什么事情会发生在自己身上。

因此,唯有当你们明白怎样奉献,才会明白以上提及的事情。如果你们想以民族性来分析事情,你们都会感到震惊。因为获得自觉,其实是超越你们的。自觉是极好的事情,对于你们,这实在是太多了。获得自觉这事情,是超越你们的。

现在试想想。「你们都获得了自觉。」你们相信吗?你们能够在此生得到自觉。假使有人告诉你这一点,你们绝不会相信,怎能在此生得到自觉呢?当然,你们都在追求某些东西,因为人们都说你们要去追求,你们亦感到自己要寻求一些东西。但你们不会想象到,你们所寻觅的,可以如此实现出来,你们都获得了自觉。

因此,在得到自觉后,你们不会感到「这是什么」。就好像当你掉进大海里,你不会知道大海有多广、有多深。你不知道自己去了多远,「这是什么?自己身处何地?我为什么要在这里?」把所有这些混乱加起来,我们变得无思无虑!因此,你们甚至不能以理性去分析自觉是什么一回事。

对于这个浩瀚无际的经验、母亲降世所带来的繁荣昌盛,以及你们获得自觉这份宝贵的礼物,你们都不能以思维能力去完全认知。你们能够理解究竟什么事情在发生吗?你们不能理解。因为理性不能令你们了解到你们现在进入了的范围有多广大。事实上,理性已经崩溃了,即使是去传达有关人们为何求道,或是你们到达了什么领域等事情,任何理性思维都不能存在。

你们现在都得到了唯一的方法、唯一的道路。滴水已经成了海洋。这滴水要溶化于海洋里,这样你才会感受到海洋。而且,你们要与其他水滴交流,这样你们才能透过其他的水滴,认识到整体。

首先,你们要有完全的虔诚,这是非常重要。尤其在你们这一世,虔诚是极为重要的,因为你们都得到了自觉。假若你们还没有得到自觉,那便没所谓了;对于抱怨的灵魂,也没所谓;对于不大虔诚的人,也没所谓;有点儿行为不端,也没所谓。所有这些事情,都会被宽恕的。所有人都以为是因为母亲宽恕了我们,重点并不在此。

母亲的宽恕源于她的本质。但你们不应该视这为理所当然的事。当你们接受母亲的宽恕时,你们其实是在找自己麻烦。如果你整天都在想着:「啊,母亲,你是多么的宽宏啊!请袮宽恕我!」你其实一早已经被宽恕了,这是母亲的本质。当你们称我为母亲时,我已经宽恕了你们。但这宽恕对你们有什么得益呢?你们从中没有得到任何益处,你只是个失败者。如果你们至少能以理性来了解这一点,你们便会明白,虔诚是什么。

因此,通过对霎哈嘉瑜伽的虔诚,人会认知到在霎哈嘉瑜伽里的事情,你们在霎哈嘉所见的事情,全都是超越思维的,这是第一点。这些事情确实是超越人类的思维概念。因此,在人类的层面,你们并不谈论霎哈嘉瑜伽,你们不会说关于霎哈嘉的事情。但在集体层面上,你们就能做到。

当你们来到集体层面,你们要明白,如果你们能以集体和一致的方式,确立你们与别人之间的关系,你们与我的关系便会越来越巩固。

我对你们说过,水滴已经成为海洋。水滴要成为海洋,它要将自己所有的水点,溶入其他的水滴之中。当所有水滴都将自己的水点溶入其他水滴之中时,所有的水滴最终会一同成为海洋。

你们会看到,虔诚是两方面的。一方面是彼此之间的虔诚,另一方面是对母亲的虔诚。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽内,我看到的,你们都看不到。这要证明给你们看吗?又或你们需要更多的证明呢?母亲所看到的远远超越我们,现在这一点已经被证实了。任何母亲看到的,都一一发生了。因此,任何人如果尝试在母亲面前玩弄什么,他们其实在玩弄着自己。任何你们尝试在我面前玩弄的把戏,又或你们认为母亲很宽宏,她会宽恕你们。但其实,你们在令自己痛苦,你们是..... 这会伤害你们自己。

很多人常常说:「我的左腹轮有问题。」有些人说:「我被亡魂附体,有邪灵支配着我。」有些人会将问题归咎于其他事情上。无论你们把责任归咎于那里也好,事实上,谁要求你解释呢?只是自己要求,但其实你并没有真正面对自己。

因此,对我的虔诚,就是面对你自己。你先要面对你自己,然后你才会看到自己在做什么。

你才是自己的敌人。没有人是你的敌人,你的母亲也不是,这是肯定的。任何情况下,她也不会是你的敌人。任何的邪灵也不会是你的敌人,如果你不容许他们的话,他们都不会存在。任何坏人也不会是你的敌人,因为假若你已经在灵性上装备好自己,这些坏人也不会有能力加害于你。因此,你才是自己的敌人,这是你自己决定的。消除你自己内在的敌人的唯一方法,就是你们要去奉献。

譬如你们说,你们都很信奉母亲,或者很信奉神,你们都握着一些东西,是不是?同时,你也摒弃了一些东西。而你们握着的力度必须是很强。理性地想想,当你们在下跌时,你们会否还去理解:「我应不应该握住拯救我的手呢?」你不会去想,反之你会握得很紧,你紧握的力度会极之强,出尽全力,并以完全的信念,紧握着这拯救力量,等待着拯救。

我们内在应该有这样的感觉:「我所以下跌,都是因为我自己。如果我想得救,必须完完全全的投入霎哈嘉瑜伽之内。我要完全溶入霎哈嘉瑜伽之内,那么我才会得到救赎。」

因为在这层次,这是你们已提升至更高的层次,成为了觉者。现在,你们下一个跃步便是我现在说的虔诚。无论在任何情况下,其他的事情都是次要的。假若你仍然认为其他的事情是首要的,仍将注意力放在那些事情上,那么,你便不会升进至第二步。

你们已经到达第一个跃步,都获得了自觉。但要从第一个跃步走到第二个跃步,你们必须很努力。你们都来到第二个跃步。在这第二跃步中,你们要去面对。你们不要厌恶自己,或者感到泄气,不需要这样。你们要视自己为独立的存在体。

奉献就是回过头来,去看看自己,观照自己内在那些神圣的品格。一旦你们拥有神圣的品格,你们在奉献方面便不会有任何问题。你们会成为奉献的整体,你会开始享受。

理性是最差劲的东西。理性其实在不断欺骗你们,令你们偏离正道,令你们不知道自己原来一直都活在物质和粗糙肤浅的生活中。你们现在都从那些粗浅的生活之中走出来了,并成长起来。你们都升进了。现在,你们要摒除理性,让自己像花儿一样盛开,散发香气。只有摒除理性,你们才会成长,两者是有连带关系的。

你们要尝试避免理性,避免争论,尝试不要去找理由。到了现在,有时候我还会听见有霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者以心理学来解释某些事情。「母亲,她可能是感到不安全。人会因为感到不安全而做出这些行为,书本一般都是这样写的。」事实上,现在我们在霎哈嘉瑜伽里都会看到,那些所谓感到不安全的人,大部分都是好侵略的人。那些人欺骗别人,损害别人的生命,并从中感到很高兴。他们都是世界上最悲哀的人。你们都见过那些人,他们都是如此玩弄自己。

现在当你们明白了,你们不会玩弄自己。为何要玩弄自己呢?为何你要玩弄自己呢?你只需要做回真我,就这样而已。我们绝不是自己的敌人,我们是自己的敌人吗?

一旦你开始面对自己,你会喜欢自己。你不会厌恶自己,因为我所说的「你」,就是你的真我。真我是庄严美丽的,而且没有任何污点(Kalanka),毫无执着。

但是,首先你要让你的注意力接受这一点..「无执着才是我的生命,我有不同的人格。无执着就是我的滋养。」让自己破除执着吧!

有一个男士来我家探望我。我家里有一盏很漂亮的灯,这个男士很喜欢这盏灯。我于是对他说:「你可以拿去。」他感到很惊喜。他的妻子后来致电对我说:「为何会这样呢?你为何会把如此美丽的灯送给别人?」我答道:「那盏灯算是什么呢?难道我在死的时候,能带走它吗?那盏灯可否跟我一起走呢?只需要理性地想想。既然他喜欢,那就让他拿去吧。我家里有很多灯,他拿走一盏,也没什么分别。」这个女士说:「但你知道吗?我曾经问过我的丈夫,如果他拥有如此美丽的灯,他会否送给别人?他说他绝不会送给别人。他说他真的不会。」他真是很诚实,他说他不会。但到现在我还不明白,为何不送给别人?当你们到了生命的尽头,你们会知道你们能拿走的东西,只有很少很少。

就如只是拿着纱丽的一小部分,我们都能将整件纱丽拿起来。找着这纱丽的一小部分,我们便会拿回整件纱丽。只是一支很细的针,便能将整件东西拿紧。

我们要否定并远离那些依附着其他东西的细针。尝试观看自己,「啊!这就是『自我先生』了。现在,让我看看,你怎样又回到从前那样。」去观看这些事情。你们看,就好像在看一出戏那样,观照着你自己。然后,你便能愚弄你的自我和超我。事实上,自我和超我常常都在愚弄着你,但当你一旦成为主人,你便能反过来玩弄它们。

曾经发生过很多次。我曾说过很多件事情,同样是在我说了之后不久,人们便开始谈论起来。人们以科学证实等等类似的方式,证实了我所说的事情。你们都曾见过,这种情况发生过很多次。

我现在对你们说的每一样东西,都是非常之肯定的。除真理之外,我不会说别的。我知道,我所说的全都是真理。但我不需要思前想后,找出某些事情究竟是否真理。我不需看书来核实任何事情。我对自己有信念,是「完全的信念」。我说的全都是真理,我完全知道,我说的任何话,都是真理。但是,你们则并非如此。你们说的,并非完全是真理。因此,你们应先建立这种状态,那么你们说的,都会是真理。

那么现在,你们应怎样做呢?你们的舌头应该是这样的,你们所说的,都必须要是真理。到了最后,亦会成为真理。因此,你们必须有奉献之心。

什么是奉献呢?那就是「我为何说谎呢?」我们根本不用说谎。

就算我说了些谎话,那谎话都会变成真的。在我的情况才是如此,我说的所谓谎话,全都会变真。事实上,那些话由此至终都不曾是谎话。当我对某人说:「这人分明是个坏人。」他答道:「母亲啊!他人品这么好!你怎能这样说他呢?」曾经有个叫米高的人,就是如此。「母亲啊,米高真的很有爱心!」有些人更说:「母亲,你是否妒忌他?」有些人居然能够说出这些话来!但当这个坏蛋现出真面目时,人们才会明白。

因此,要建立这种对真理的知性,你们首先要将自己固定在真理之上。这真理就是:「你们都是上天浩爱的工具,你们都得到了自觉,如此特别的知觉状态,其他人是没有的。」站在这真理之上,并把这真理宣扬开去。你们无需害怕。你们都得到了自觉,这是毋容置疑的。你们都感受得到。你们要说出来:「我已得到了自觉。我什么也没做,我知道我是觉者。」你们必须肯定这一点。

在体现这真理之时,你们就好像光那样。光肯定存在着,但光不只是存在,它还向人展现它的光芒。它向其他人展示出:「我就是光。你们都需要走在我的光明之内。否则,我的光可能会把你烧伤。」光拥有你们所说那种叫Tejasvita的特质。

Tejasvita即光的锐利。Tejasvita是存在的,这光的锐利。这光的锐利证明了你们之中存在着真理。你们不会害怕什么部长、总理,或者什么国王等等。你们会知道:「这是事实。我很确切地知道这是真实地存在的。我是已经得到自觉的灵,我就是真理。」如果你们说:「我是真理。」那么,你所说的任何事情,都会成为真理,这是无需怀疑的。你所做的任何事情,都会成为真理。但请说:「我是真理。」

要做到这一点,你们需要真正的净化,你们要通过奉献的心,完完全全的面对自己。你们都紧握着母亲的手,紧握着霎哈嘉瑜伽,紧握着你们找到的真理。而现在,你们都要面对其他人。如果你们不坚守着真理,你们便不能面对其他人,因为真理是你们的泉源。你们都站在真理之上。真理就是这力量,就是力量的泉源。

你们看看所有的圣人,基督拥有这真理的力量,穆罕默德拥有这力量,所有伟大的圣人都拥有真理的力量。他们以完全的勇气,把真理说出来。人们都很接受他们的意见主张。这些圣人甚至会因为说出真理而受尽苦头,但他们不介意。因为凡是真理的,都应该说出来。

关于奉献,你们首先要知道,你们要完全的奉献,你们不用害怕任何人,你们不会担心自己有任何损失。

从前,有些圣人甚至失掉头颅,他们被斩首。人们都折磨他们,抢去他们的钱。人们以各种各样的方式折磨他们。但这些圣人仍然坚守这个真理。他们站于真理之上。其他的蠢才都站在虚假的东西上,但是圣人们都是站于真理之上。

你们都要知道「现在」,你们都站于真理上,你们要为真理而牺牲。这是因为你们所牺牲的,并不是真理。你们只是牺牲虚假的东西。

因此,你们需要一些有力量和勇气的人,而不是那些一半忠诚的人,从早到晚都在请求母亲的宽恕。他们在做什么?有什么需要求宽恕呢?我每一刻都在宽恕你们。你们在做什么呢?你是怎么样的人呢?

你们要仔细想想,你们都站于真理之上,因此,必须成为坚定和勇敢的人。你们并且要拥有光的锐利,就是你们内在的指路明灯所发放的光芒。

同时,你们要有完全奉献之心。

譬如当这盏灯没有灯油,便会熄灭。这灯是需要有灯油的。因此,奉献之心就是你们内在的灯油,这是一个依附的关系。你们要完完全全地依附于你们力量的源头。这就是奉献。这奉献不会给予你任何其他的念头,他只会给予你们闪耀的光,让你们能够改正他人,并指引他人的方向。

如果你没有完全奉献的话,你所连接的源头,便不能把能量完全传送给你,你这盏灯便不能妥当地燃点着。

因此,当你走进奉献之中,你不要以为这是什么让步_________你们所谓的让步,即是说那人会像个傻瓜。很多人都有这种想法,认为当人奉献,那人便会像傻瓜般没趣。事实上,你们反而会充满活力!你们会成为真正的力量,不是破坏的力量,而是真正建设的力量。破坏其实并不需要什么力量。只有是建设,才需要力量。如果去破坏,你们需要什么?只是一点点的力便足够。你能在一瞬间破坏整件事。但如果要建设的话,便真的需要极大的力量。这用以维持及流动着的力量必须要存在。因此,奉献是必须的。

握紧你们力量的源头,你们要充满活力,并无畏地坚守着。这就是真理,这是你们要到达的真理。这是极之重要。

但奉献只是其中一方面。这并不足够。成为真理是一方面。而另一方面就是,当这力量的泉源进入了你之内,你会成为慈悲。真理与慈悲,其实是一样的。你可能不会相信,但这是事实。就正如灯芯和灯油加起来,便会成了光。要燃烧灯油,才会有光。同样,慈悲能给你真理。两者并没有分别,只是状态不同罢了。只是你们不能看见成了光的灯油,你们也看不见正在燃烧的灯油。

因此,慈悲除了是你的力量之源之外,也是你们的储备。从慈悲这源头,你们得到了慈悲之心。

我见过一些人,他们想从我处得到慈悲,他们很想我去爱他们。但反过来,他们爱护别人吗?我认识一些人,他们对别人说些很刻薄的说话,然后便来对着我说:「母亲,宽恕我。」或者只为了一时兴致,苛刻地对待别人,然后又对我说:「母亲,宽恕我。」但当你这样请求我宽恕时,我很想知道,你有没有以慈悲来对待别人呢?就算我宽恕了你们,你们获得了这宽恕的泉源、这爱的泉源,但你们有否将这爱给予其他人呢?你有否以慈悲待人呢?你们看,这慈悲并不是单方面的。当你们在享受这慈悲时,你们不能只是单向地接受,只想着自己的好处,然后便忘了这恩赐。这样,你们是永不会成长的。

你们要成长的话,便应将这爱贮存在你们之内。所有我给予你们的爱和慈悲,你们都要贮存起来。然后,把这些爱给予其他人。否则,你们便会完结,并变得迷失。只有通过不断地给予,你们内在的成长便得以持续,不只是单向地接受。如果你们不给予,你们只会停滞下来,且总会有些外流的。

但这是很困难的,因为人们很懂得拿取母亲的慈悲。就算他们有慈悲之心,他们都只是对某些人,例如是对越南人有极大的慈悲,但对霎哈嘉瑜伽静室里的人却没有慈悲。他们好像更为越南人担心,你们知道吗?「母亲啊!我们很担心那些越南人,我们正为他们筹款,并会将善款寄给他们。」但在瑜伽静室里,他们则在互相争斗。这可不能算得上是慈悲吧!

霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者是来自不同种族的,他们要互相扶持,任何时候都应互相照顾。当我见到有些练习者批评其他练习者,我会感到很诧异!我真的非常诧异!因为你们同是上天力量的一部分。你们怎能互相批评!一只眼批评另外一只眼,我完全不明白。我能去批评,但你们应该这样吗?你们为何要互相批评?你们唯一要做的,就是互相爱护。

基督说过三次,我亦曾经说过一百零八次以上:「你们要互相爱护,这是唯一能表达慈悲的方法。」我曾经在何时给予了你们的爱,你们要以耐心和爱去转赠给别人。有时候我会巧妙地诱哄某些人,他们随即说些批评别人的说话来。

现在最基本的是,只有当我们的慈悲是流通着,我们才能够从母亲处得到慈悲。我在慈悲这方面做了很多,我发觉到,除非你们让慈悲流通着,否则我没有任何方法将慈悲给予你们。我的意思是,再没有空间去吸取我的慈悲。最好是能把慈悲给予别人,让自己留下点空间,那么我便能给予你们更多的慈悲。这是很简单的事情。在这方面,你们要明白到,除非上天的爱能够流动并扩展开去,否则这爱的泉源便不能通过。

就好像泰晤士河。我们曾到过这条河流的源头。那儿是一条很小的河流,从七条极之细小的河流,一点一滴地汇流而成,然后成为了泰晤士河。假设这小河流没有变阔,这样它只会停滞在源头的位置,它不能够流出来,不能够流通。这小河流不是因生气或烦恼而不流动,只是因为它流动的本质被阻塞而不流动。那怎么办呢?

因此,人要以慈悲待人。这慈悲并不是表面的,也不是感情用事的。这慈悲是自然而然,发自内心的感觉。它不是自我、超我和多愁善感的表现,而是当人了解到自己是霎哈嘉瑜伽士,了解到其他兄弟姊妹也是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。你们不是一般的兄弟姊妹,你们是灵性上的兄弟姊妹,你们都是圣人。

你们必须拥有这种发自内心的慈悲,并发展出强烈的父性和母性的感觉去爱其他人,我的意思是,我也是一个一百零八岁的瑜伽士的母亲。你们真的要像母亲般照顾别人,并对别人有爱和慈悲。你不需要理会自己的舒适,不需要去想有关自己的好处,只需要想别人的舒适就足够了。你们先要去想:「我能做什么令别人感到舒适呢?」然后才考虑怎样令自己舒适。

当这慈悲的河流开始流动,你们便能达到完全的奉献。因为你们明白到:「母亲,任何你所赐给我们的,我们都会给予其他人。」这就是奉献。因此,奉献并不是单向,而是双向的。你们依附着、连接上一些东西,并从其中获得一些东西,然后再给予别人。最后,你们能成为整体,即回到本源。我们就在这光芒中明白一切。

独占一些东西,又或者是「我们已结婚,因此我们需要有自己的地方,要跟集体分开住。」这样做是可以的,你们结婚后是应该有一点私隐的,我不是说你们不应这样。但你们亦应考虑到慈悲这一点。作为已婚的人,你们应该更加更加具有慈悲之心。但是,你们只担心自己的子女、自己的舒适、自己的丈夫、妻子。在霎哈嘉瑜伽里,没有甚么位置容纳这些人。所有人都是同一个集体。当你给自己的子女糖果,你也应该把糖果带给瑜伽静室的小孩。你们都属于同一个家庭,所有的家庭都应该是跟随同一个潮涌。我亦曾告诉过你们不应有分开的膳食安排,分开这,分开那。同样地,我们不应给予不同的人以不同的生活质素。

我们要享受任何我们一起分享的事情。在物质的层面上,我们亦应该一起分享。在情感的层面上,那些荒谬、令所有人不高兴的婚姻是完全没有用的。婚姻的存在是为了将快乐带给所有人。因此,在决定结婚之前,你要仔细想想,你并不是在玩把戏。在霎哈嘉瑜伽玩把戏,是一件极为危险的事情。不要以婚姻来玩把戏,不要试图让第三者加入,以为母亲会宽恕之类。我是会宽恕的,但是你的升进会变得很困难。因此,你们不要玩弄从前那些把戏。你们要完全地改变自己,完全地转化过来。

现在,你们已经改变了对生命的态度。你们可以做到,因为你们都已经改变过来。如果你们尝试变成另一个人,是无可能的。现在,你们都变成了花朵,你们不会突然变成叶片。现在,你们都成为了花朵,你们要活像花朵一般。你们必须紧记,慈悲是向外流动的,在霎哈嘉瑜伽里,这是最自然不过的事情。对其他人来说,慈悲则一点也不自然。那些人只是在口里说慈悲,他们其实一点慈悲之心也没有。这些人做慈善,只是为了金钱,为了地位,和满足他们的自我。但你们拥有慈悲之心,是因为你们需要拥有这慈悲,你们因慈悲而感到愉快。这慈悲在流动,因为衪是要流动的。你们都会做些慈悲的事情。慈悲的背后,并没有任何目的。唯有当你没有任何目的,才会在慈悲之中获一些来自永恒本质的东西,即来自Sthayi本质的东西。

你们都看见有些人,正如我今早所说,有些人参与了一些组织,然后把那些组织做得很漂亮。但当他们一离开,那个组织便完蛋了。这是因为这些人没有为那个组织付出一些实质的东西。他们要付出的,就是一个很大很大、并充满慈悲的心。假如你们没有付出慈悲之心,你们一旦离开那些组织,其余的人都只会返回不能成长的状态。这并不是成长。如果你灌溉一片土地来种植,那片土地便会茂盛地生长,并变得很美丽。但一旦没有了水源,那土地也只会从回昔日干涸的状态。

霎哈嘉瑜伽是不同的。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你们不只是生长成为一棵植物,你们还成为了植物的生命源头。当这植物被拔出来移植到别处,这植物会将水带给其他植物。你们知道吗?你们内在存在着这崭新的特质。这特质令这植物即使被拔起来,它也不会死去,完全不会。它只会不断地成长,并帮助其他人成长。帮助他人成长,是我们的另一种成长。我们都处于这个与别不同的位置,我很希望你们每一个人都能够做到,就算你们被连根拔起,并放到其他的地方......我亦曾见过,当我提醒一些人移居到其他地方会帮助他们升进,他们听了后都大吃一惊。「你们应该到某地方做某些事情。」他们听了后都很吃惊。你们不只是一棵能够走动,并将繁荣带到其他地方的植物,还能够给予其他植物所需的养份。你们所有人都是如此!因此,不要只停留在一个地方。假如你只停留在一个地方,那么,这个地方必定有些问题。如果你好像浆糊一般老是黏在一个地方,这是非常危险的。你们要确信,你们必需离开这黏着你的地方。这不是说,人们来到这里,就从不留在家中,任何时间都在外面。不是这个意思。我要再次强调这一点。否则,人们便来到这里,整天都不回家。这不是真正的意思。真正的意思是,你们不应黏附着任何东西,也不应害怕离开任何地方,因为你们现在都是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。你们都跟海洋接合了,海洋可以带你到任何地方。你们只需作好心理准备,会移居到其他地方,因为你们要将这上天的慈悲带到世界每一个角落,并繁盛起来。在神的国度里,你们都要侍奉衪。只有当你们知道,你们在这里是为了一件「极之伟大」的全球性工作,这侍奉上帝的工作才可能发生。不只为了英国、印度或美国,你们在这里是为了这全球性的工作,这工作是人类升进的精髓。这是我们要为天地万物以及做物主所做的事,是最为崇高的事情。你们都是被拣选出来的。不要让你们的注意力分散到任何不能帮助你们达至真我的东西上。把那些东西全部摒弃,不要浪费你的精力。你们的真我,就是你们的慈悲和爱。

但仍然要说的是,这件事不应以理性来看待。所有我告诉你们的,只是为了将你们放到一个状态,让你们开始吸入上天的能量,以及将能量给予别人。这是一个动作,这是正在你们内在发生的事情。这不是理性,不是去想着这事情。只是告诉你这些,我便令你们的思维目瞪口呆了。你们要容许这能量在你们内在作用起来。凭借这能量的知觉状态,你们要审判你自己:「我有否将能量给予别人呢?又或我只在将能量储存起来,并因此而伤害到自己呢?」

以上的讲话会给予你们很大的意义,也会为你们带来工作,就如我所说:「上天雇用了你们。」

If you have any questions, ask Me.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, if you become angry at any point with people, is that because it’s a tendency or a negative entity? Or is it just a tendency to react like that?

Shri Mataji: You see, if you get angry within yourself, and if you are sure that you are not doing anything wrong, for a Sahaja Yogi there is no need to say outside you are angry. There’s no need. That anger itself is a power.

And you should do your bandhan and anything that you want to do. But you should not show that you are angry. You should be absolutely silent. Because you can be; you are in the axis, you are not on the periphery. Actually, the anger is just to see your anger and use that anger for that purpose. And once you start doing that, that anger will itself work out. That anger will itself work out the person. And you’ll be amazed how it... but you must learn to see your anger that is working. All these things are important. You have seen that sometimes only shouting at the bhoots - they go away. And many mad people have been cured like that.

But you don’t do all that, that’s for Me. You must be always decent, with decorum and all that. But if the anger is because of your nature, or a tendency, or out of control - than it’s a bad thing. If it is an out-of-control, than it’s a bad thing. If you get into a temper because it is out of control, than it’s a bad thing. I can get very angry, but I am completely under control: I know I am angry, where the bhoot is, how he is running away; I can see it. But you can’t see the bhoot, you can’t see anything. So there is no need for you to get angry, show temper. But if you have an anger - say, for example, which makes you uncontrollable - then there is a mantra for that: Shanti [peace]. “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.” You must ask for that bliss, for that peace. This is a mantra for you. For controlling your temper, you have to tell yourself, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.” So Shanti is the point - the axis point is that - from where you witness everything. You are in Shanti, you are in complete... you are not in a turmoil even if you are angry. You are not in a turmoil. Whatever is anger is the power, and the power is taking charge. But unless and until that is achieved, what you have to do is to put yourself in a position that you are peaceful.

So I think that’s a very good mantra - is to say, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.” Can you say that? So the Shanti is your fort. But peacefulness never means cowardice. Never call cowardice as peace. A person who is peaceful is never coward, because nothing can transgress it, nothing can overpower it. It is never never possible that cowardice and peace can go together. But your power is inside, not outside. So you don’t show your power of your anger outside. But just little anger with anybody - you will see it will work out.

But first establish that... that position within you where you are the axis, where you do not allow anger to sit on your head. That is the growth. That is the growth, that you are at peace. Also... Another question? All right, satisfied now? Both ways you should know: that one is the anger that is detached - is perfectly all right; anger which involves you - work it out. So judge yourself as to what it is. Good question.Ask some questions.I mean, such intellectuals sitting here. Ask Me some questions what is there.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, what are Your plans to spread Sahaja Yoga in outer scale?Shri Mataji: What are My plans? I don’t plan. You see, I don’t plan, because I don’t know how far My instruments are ready, you see. First, now My only plans - if I have any - is to really prepare My weapons all right. Once they are done, then we’ll fix them up. You see, unless and until you know how far your bomb can fall, how can you plan it? So, first of all, I must measure up the power of My children, how powerful they are. That’s what I’m trying to do now - is to make them aware of their powers to use.Like, you see, Hanumana, when He was born and when He grew up, He forgot that time, and He forgot His powers. So He was to be reminded that “You are such and such powerful person. You don’t know what your powers are, you... you ate of the whole of Surya. This you did in your childhood. You are born with this power, but now, after growing, you are... rather bit... sort of forgotten it, and also you were afraid of using them, and it’s... sort of looks like in the dominant position. But it is there. If you just try to remember them, it will come up.” They have tremendous power, these people have tremendous power. But they have to assume and stand on that.

If they do not do it... You see, if I tell them, “Now, go to this house” - “Oh, Mother, there may be a bhoot there sitting.” A person comes possessed in the ashram - they all shut their doors: “Oh God, this bhoot has come.” Or something - then worse.

Djamel: Mother, may I ask you something? How can we deal with, You see, there is one problem, one big problem in Sahaja Yoga, You know. It’s those who are devoted to You at the expense of others.Shri Mataji: Those who are devoted to Me?Djamel: All those who use the excuse of their devoting to You, Mother, sometimes to oppress others.Shri Mataji: They are what?Djamel: Sometimes people use their devotion to You as, at the expense of others or-Shri Mataji: Then again the same thing, Djamel. It's the same thing is. You see it is: you have to do it. All those who are doing that way, I am just pointing out to all those.It you are using, say, your devotion to Me for the oppressing of others, all right? So it is for you to see.

There is nobody who can be oppressed, because your Spirit cannot be oppressed. Say, there is X and Y. Now, Y is a person who’s trying to oppress X, all right? What will you oppress? He can’t oppress his Spirit, can he? First point. Clear. Now, this fellow, if he has to have attachment to Me, nobody can stop him.There is all... you all have direct relationship with Me. Not through anyone. If you want to accept somebody’s agency, then I can’t help you. But, otherwise, you all have a direct access to Me. You all can grow your Spirits; nobody can dominate you. Everyone has complete freedom to grow their Spirit - to know their Spirit, I mean to say. And the Spirit is something... cannot be dominated by anyone. Now, supposing somebody tries to oppress you. What will they oppress you, in which way? They’ll say, “All right, we’ll not have this carpet, we’ll have that carpet.” Have it!Somebody will say, “I’ll jump in the sea.” Jump! Just now you jump! What will they oppress you in? You see, just see that. Not in your spiritual growth. Can they? And that’s how the problem starts. You see, in material things... say, in an ashram now somebody says, “All right, we would like to have a photograph of Mother put there.” The other will say, “No, we are going to have it there.” Whether you put it here or there makes no difference. My photograph is going to work it out. Even in puja matters I’ve seen: people will say that “No, Mother is sitting there, don’t put your feet towards the Mother.” It is common thing; everybody knows should not put it. But still they will say, “No, we want to put it.” All right, let them put it. Next time they will not, because they will know it is wrong. They will find out. So, you see, nobody can oppress anyone.

I am here to correct. Once you understand that you are not perfect, the other is not perfect, we are all perfecting ourselves, we are all coming up, Mother is there to look after us - then we will never think like that. Now. I’ve also seen, people will say that there are two Sahaja Yogis talking to others... Sahaja Yogis. Now, one is a very oppressive one, the another one is upset to see that this one is oppressive. Now, for that purpose, if you are quiet, silent - you will always dominate him. People will listen to you, not to him. But even if you start saying, “Oh, you don’t say like that,” this, this, they will think these are fighting cocks. Then, at that time, you are wise at this thing - will even give him a chance to understand. But what happens: one person dominates, another tries to dominate them by outward things. And the whole show is over. There is no need to dominate another person by outward things. He will settle down by himself if you show your dignity of your silence and of your understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

There is no need just now to say, “Shut up, you sit down, you don’t do.” It’s absolutely wrong. They do it, I’ve seen it. In My presence I’ve seen it. Because we still live halfway there and halfway here. The way we solve the problem... say, you have to do some business. There are two people doing the business. One person says something, another says, “Why did you say like this, you shouldn’t say.” This person says to that person, “You shouldn’t correct me.”

Like that the fight is on. But that doesn’t help anyway... there also. But in Sahaja Yoga it will never help. The another person can only win over by his dignity. By his quiet methods, by approaching a person properly. That’s how the leaders will come up. They won’t come up by shooting another person down, not at all by any chance. That’s not possible. Is not good leadership. Good leadership is judged the way you handle the situation.Not the way you fight another man down. So many times you have seen: I just keep quiet - it works out. Not necessary that you should at that moment shout. There’s no need. And it creates a very bad impression and very bad leadership. First of all, you cannot be dominated. This is one fact, is a truth. You can grow in your spirituality, whatever people may try to dominate in the worldly things. Thank God we don’t have any organization. Thank God we don’t have secretaries, assistant secretaries, under-secretaries, by-secretaries, upper secretaries, lower secretaries - we don’t have any nonsense.

Otherwise, even that would have been dominating to people. Then they would have fought that. So we don’t have that problem. We don’t have any money problem, because we don’t have all these nonsensical ideas. I’ve solved this problem by having no institutions, no positions. Everybody has position.

But the greatest position is of your Spirit, which you establish. The attention is not there, is more ego-oriented. The whole stuff is ego-oriented. You can’t fight ego with ego, you cannot. You can only fight ego or superego with Spirit. How much do I dominate you? I absorb all your aggression also. And how much do I dominate you? If I have to correct you, I go forward and do it, and tell you that I’m correcting you, whether you like it or not. And you see the result, it’s all right. But if you have that capacity, do it. Then there is lacking in you, that you cannot do that way, so be prepared not to, at least, spoil the show of Sahaja Yoga. One person is talking too much? All right, the others will say, “He is good for nothing, but another one is a sensible one.” But if you both are fighting, then I don’t know.That’s... doesn’t show any wisdom or growth, isn’t it? Does it? Those who think that by dominating in small small things you are going to achieve anything are wrong. Actually, I’ve seen, My grandchildren are realized souls. They are not bothered about these things, they don’t do this. This kind of a fight they don’t have. That “where to keep this”, “what to do this” - they don’t have. Nothing. At the most, they might fight for a chocolate or something, at the most. But in spiritual matters, they never fight. In spiritual matters they never fight. That’s a place one should not fight, one should not argue. That’s the point not to be argued, because truth is one. What is there to argue? You have seen all these saints, you see, those who have talked about Me. What do they say? Everybody says the same thing about Me. There cannot be any fight between saints, can there be? If the truth is one, how can there be fight? But because one is inadequate, another is dominating - both must achieve that state.

But the best is to be more dignified, more grown-up, more patronizing... People will definitely take to you because you will become the leader. Arguments are not going to lead you anywhere, I can tell you this much. No use arguing among yourself. If you have to argue, you have to argue with others, not among yourself. Otherwise now? What else? What is the thing?Any other question?

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, would You please tell a little bit how... how we fight our ego with the Spirit? How would you do...Shri Mataji: How do we fight the ego...Sahaja Yogini: ... ego with the Spirit.Shri Mataji: You see, you should never fight ego. If you try to fight, it will sit more on your head. That’s not the way to fight it, that there is ego and you fight your ego: “Oh, I’m going to box you” - then it will grow more, you see. The more you box it, the more it will grow. Never fight your ego. Only way is to see it. Your attention is very important, your attention is now enlightened. Whatever you see, it comes to its right size. It comes to its right side... size. Say, ego - if it is overgrown, you just watch your ego. That is, it is to watch yourself in the mirror, and you say, “Oh, Mr. Ego, how do you do?” Then it will come down. But don’t fight it. Just to be seen. All kinds of egos could be there. If you are overeducated, you are egoistical. If you are uneducated, you are egoistical - because you must try to show that you are something. All sorts of egos are there. So best thing is to see for yourself; that’s why I say, “Face yourself.” “Yourself” means your Spirit.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, that goes the same for the superego?

Shri Mataji: Yes, very much so. For superego also - not to be frightened. You should just say, “Get out! I can see you very clearly, you are there. You get out from here! How dare you frighten me? I am the Spirit. I am the Spirit, how dare you can do that?” That’s how. You see, ego makes you idiotic. Absolutely. Ego makes you idiotic, makes an idiot out of you, absolutely. And the superego makes you a coward. It makes you a coward. Now, how to fight it? “I’m not going to be an idiot” - if you say that, ego will go away. If you want to be an idiot, then he’ll be there to help you. If you want to be an idiot, all right, call Mr. Ego. You’ll become an idiot, straightforward.

Is the easiest way. Easiest way. If you want to become an idiot, simple thing is to call the ego. “You come, Mr. Ego, and settle down in me” - and immediately... this is a very simple composition. And superego... if you are a coward, then it sits on your head. Say, “I am not going to be...” Ham Ksham, as I told you, the mantra on the Agnya is. Either you have to say, “I am”; the other, I say, “I forgive you.”

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, may I ask You a question similar to what he said about superego? I’ll be particular. I’m still having problems with my eating. I’m eating over here. But I’m very afraid, I’m laughing because it is silly, that I’ll become fat. And I’m very afraid, I think a lot about food all the time. Yet I know that with You nothing bad can happen to me,Shri Mataji: All right, you do one thing just now. You put your left hand towards Me, andright hand outside.

She has the Hamsa here, caught up. There, you see the Hamsa. Tell her to come now. Come in, come in. I see, sorry. Put the Hamsa, I didn’t see it clearly.Hello [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi] We’ve been waiting for you.Come forward, you can come forward a little bit. Lots of people are there. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: What’s the time now?Sahaja Yogi: Quarter past nine, nine fifteen.Shri Mataji: Quarter past nine,

As I’ve told you, that relationship with yourself should be tyrannical. You should lash it down.You should absolutely make it clear to yourself that “I have to perfect myself if I have to give this my being to God. It has to be perfect.” Secondly, if you have to have relationship with others, it has to be ideal relationship. Sahaja Yogi with Sahaja Yogi - means something great. The greatest relationship is that.

With your sister, with your brother - it should be ideal. And in collectivity we have to be pragmatic. In collectivity we can change our course, we’ll take the way we like, the way it moves; we’ll manage it. But otherwise... You see, for example, take a plane. It has the same thing. Plane, when it is in the air, it can go wherever it likes. But the screws that are fixed in a plane are ideally fixed. They cannot just start... like a pilot seat doesn’t go to the back, and the back doesn’t come to the front, you see. The relationship is maintained.

All right? And the screws which are made, or anything that is made - is perfect. But airplane is not fixed. Airplane can go southward, northward... anywhere it wants to. Only the things that are in it are correlated with each other in such proportion that they cannot budge from their ideal positions. I’m giving this example because you are here. You’ll understand it better now. And these things that you have produced are themselves... are perfect. If they are imperfect, there will be a problem. It’s like that.

If you understand this very simple thing about relations and attitudes, you will never have problems. Your relationship with a Sahaja Yogi has to be absolutely ideal relationship. Otherwise, some screw is loose. Try to make it ideal. Say, there’s one person. You find the person is too egoistical, or something. Try to see what’s wrong with you, first of all: “Am I perfect? Am I all right? Or am I equally dominating, am I equally egoistical?

All right, if I am, then I better correct myself. But if I am not, if I am a good person, that way I’m not dominating - then I should try to bring down his ego by making sweet things to him, making nice relationship with him.” Try to be kind to him, so that his ego comes down. Manage somehow or other to establish ideal relationship. Is absolutely simple. I mean, I don’t understand what have I to tell in this thing. You know everything. That it has to be proper. Now see, the relationship between that and Me has to be proper, so that it doesn’t burn Me, isn’t it? It’s absolutely... in lifetime, also, we have to do the same thing - that relationship with each other has to be ideal to create the best results. It is so practical; I don’t know what is there to tell in this thing. And you have to be perfect because you are the unit. And the whole thing can be pragmatic. Then only it can be. But here just the other way round. The screws are pragmatic, the relationship is imperfect, and the collectivity is absolutely static. Doesn’t move. “The collectivity. After all, we are collective, bound to each other. How can we move, Mother, we are static now. We are bound to each other, we can’t move, you see.” Just like the Rock of Gibraltar. Now, you’ve been an aeronautic engineer, you should understand this better than anybody else, this example.

What else is the question?[To someone]: How are you? All right?I’m asking.

What other question?Rustom: Shri Mataji, could You say something about maintaining our attention so that it stays where it should and it doesn’t get diverted into trivial things?Shri Mataji: Rustom has asked a very practical question, it's true - that "to keep the attention where it should be."You see, for everything you have to do some exercise - abhyasa - not before Realization, after Realization. The best way is to learn how to watch yourself. Just now, sitting here, just put yourself into a position from where you watch yourself: "Now what am I doing?"This is the abhyasa, this is the study. Apart from mantras, apart from anything, the abhyasa is the practice, practice of becoming a witness. And the witness is the Spirit state. There attention will not go. I mean you will see everything, it is there, but attention will be inside. Try to practice this: "Am I a witness?"Now, say, some people say:" Oh God! I had a horrible time, Mother. This happened, that happened." You see, you are not a witness. How can you have a horrible time if you are the Spirit? You only have a horrible time when you are not the Spirit.If you can watch the whole thing as a drama that is played, then you are not having a horrible time, but this outside of you is having a horrible time, which you are watching.

That's how the attention can be fixed very well if you practice abhyasas, practice all the time to be witness. Say, you go out, you see something, just try to see it, not to think about it. Be a witness of the whole thing. The joy will be complete, and also you will become absolutely peaceful. Your attention will be completely enlightened.And then the inspiration you will get will be tremendous.

See, it's working out. Working out. Try to watch. And it has such a tremendous memory, if you know how to watch. I mean, to Me, if I see something - I mean, to Me it is just like a film in My mind. If I have seen this room, now I know what is in this design. Everything I know: how you are sitting, what pose you have taken, how you were, what was it - everything is like a design. You see it comes to Me, just like a picture - absolutely. Not of this life, but of lives.

Because that's a recording system that records best. If there are thoughts it's like something in between, you see. Now he is trying to record Me on the film, and if there is something in between moving, nothing will come in. But when there is nothing in between and you are just seeing through, you are recording everything that is important. Moreover you will be amazed, you don't record unimportant things.Like for people now, they go to a village, or any place. They will be recording: "Oh God, it was very dirty, and this happened and we went there and there were cement to sleep, for example, we get." Or: "Then we went inside, and there was no proper chair to sit down. And the chair was so hard, and my back started aching." All these things they will remember.And then what happened? "Oh God! I couldn't get Realization."Everything that bad, you see, just like newspaper - all bad news. But to a person who is a Realized soul in a real way, he doesn't see, I mean, you don't smell anything dirty. You always smell something good. You never smell, you do not think of anything dirty. Everywhere you go, it's beautiful. Even if you see just the sand, you see the pattern. Even if you see a barren hill.

I saw some people who had gone. I said, "Look at the beauty of these hills, in Maharashtra." They said: "Mother, what is the beauty? It's not covered with trees." I said, "That's the beauty, just see the patterns." They couldn't see the patterns that I was seeing. But if you ask Me, "What is this hill?" I also know that. Because I know the patterns of all the hills, how it has moved, how it has made patterns and things like that. Because they don't see that, you see, they cannot see the beauty because they are looking out for defects. Or relatively, you see, "English trees are better than say X, Y, Z trees. So then this is not better." The relative they start. But you are at absolute point, you are getting the absolute of everything. Everything is your own. What is there to judge?

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.Shri Mataji: Eh?Sahaja Yogi: Perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.Shri Mataji: I am the Artist and I am the Art. But what about you? Who are you? You are the... you are the one who is created, and you can create, and you can become the artist. That’s what I’m saying - that you are not only the light but the light that will give light to others. And, also, you will sustain that light which you have given light. This is the difference now between you and other people. Not that only you will be an artist but you’ll enjoy the art of the Artist. This is what you have got. You don’t know, you are not aware of your powers. It’s a dynamic thing which has happened to you, which you should take to.But our attention is on from where the dirt is coming, where the filth is coming, you know; where the ugliness is there. If your attention is on uglines- people tell Me: "There was, this was ugly." I said: "I didn't see." I just saw the way the elephant was standing, you see. The way he has pulled up his leg and he was raising his trunk. I never saw the dirt part of it. “Where was it?” “At the back of it.” I say: “I never went on the back.”

If your attention is so- even description of a person. You ask a person, “How is he?” “He’s a...” All his... I mean, little funny points will come to your head. Even the photographers, I’ve seen. They will only take photograph when you are in a funny way, you see; when your face is little turned round... I mean, it’s a seeking after ugliness, seeking after mistakes, seeking after something wrong. All the time if you do like this, you cannot be a happy person. All the time trying to find out defects, and faults, and mistakes, and dirt, and ugliness. I mean, you are in for trouble. You’re asking for it. Like a person was saying there are three-four ditches in this place. I said, “Did you jump into one of them? Better jump in. So, once for all, you don’t see any other ditch.” You don’t see the playing grounds, you are just seeing the ditches. For what?! The same thing can look ugly to a person who is of that kind of an attitude, who wants to see everything ugly. Try your attitudes. Try to see good in others. Try to see... not in... may not be... it... I’m not saying for other people, but I’m saying at least for Sahaja Yogis you can do it. Try to see good in them; what good they have done to Sahaja Yoga, what you owe to them, how to get along with them. Why not see the good of them?

By giving them encouragement, by being good to them you are helping Sahaja Yoga. But you want to help your ego, because you are very “wise”. So, then only, when by appreciating another person only, you have better relationship. This is a very simple fact. You see any film - there the two people are talking to each other as if they are barking at each other. What does it take to be kind, to be gentle, to say pleasant things? As soon as they will see a person - “Oh God! You have become very ugly!” This is the best compliment. That’s human nature - to see to the faults of others, to see to the wrong things of others.

You see, they will find out in anything. Somebody is very tidy - then that person is bad. Somebody is very untidy - that person is bad. Every sort of thing. But why not you do something about yourself, that there’s something inside you which is not tidy? And inside you that’s very upsetting. To Me it makes no difference, you have seen it. It makes no difference. If you say, I’ll sleep here. If you say, I’ll sleep on the... on the grass there. To Me makes no difference to what bathroom I go... I don’t even remember all those things. What is there to remember in a bathroom, and this, and that? All nonsense it is. I have no memory for all these things. Even if you want Me to know, I will not remember. If you ask Me, “How did you go to that bathroom?” - “Which one?” “That one.” I said, “It’s all right, I’ve been there.” Then food.

“What sort of a taste it was?” and “What food it was?” and... all sorts of things people go on thinking a lot. What’s the use? The whole food is going to just be digested in the same stomach. What is there to be so much worried about all these things? We are wasting our energy. I don’t waste My energy. I have no energy for wasting. In the same way, why do you waste your energy? Why not see to the better side of man? By seeing bad side, if you can cure it - well and good.

But if you cannot cure it, you are going to get yourself bad. If you can cure it - nothing like it. But you can’t. Also once... always person say, “I would not do that.” But you would do something else that the other person would not do. When judging others, one has to know one should judge oneself first of all. Because with what are you judging? With your ego or superego. I’ve seen, it’s a very common failing, which should not be there any more. Now you are realized souls, you are saints. And the saints... though olden saints might be doing whatever they did - forget them. But you people are not going to see the faults of each other but to the good points of everyone. Simple things I’ve seen: somebody says a wrong English word, or a Sanskrit word, or a wrong this - immediately you will catch on that. But he gives a big lecture - it’s all right. That nobody listens. Your mind is working: “What wrong thing he’s going to say?” Attention should be onto what he said, it’s so beautiful. And then you will develop an attitude - as Mine is - you’ll never see to the defects of the place. Never.

Never. [UNCLEAR]. You will have no eyes to see. I mean, Mine is like that, condition is like that, I tell you. It will be like that. It’s very difficult. Like somebody says, “You come and play those cards with sticks” - I never remember. I’ll always lose. So I said, “What’s the use of play it? I don’t remember.” See, everybody says, “You have so many brains otherwise, can’t you remember these three cards?” I can’t, I can’t. It’s just My brain goes off. I put automa... I don’t know. I look like a stupid fool when I play that game. So why should I play? Anything like that - I am absolutely good for nothing. So it’s a thing people know: “Oh, she is useless. Forget her.” But it should become automatic with you also.

Then it’s so enjoyable: how beautiful we are, that everything is so beautiful around us to see. Such beauty exists and we do not see it! Such tremendous joy! Every bliss is there flowing within us. And we don’t know, we don’t notice it. It’s such a happy thing. It’s such a beautiful thing. “Oh God, such a source of joy!” - was just standing next to Me. I never knew. And just I turned round and saw that force. Turn round! Turn your back to all conditionings of yours, the ideas that you have... Do not pass judgement, first thing is. Great art critics and all that, please, I beg of you, that do not pass remarks at anything all the time. Is ego playing the trick. Just watch it, how it is making you feel that you are something very great. Be careful. There were some people coming from America, have they come?

Sahaja Yogini: Steve and Christine, they called to say...

Shri Mataji: They haven’t come.

Sahaja Yogini: They’re coming in one week. One more week they’re coming.

Shri Mataji: So then we’ll decide, when they come here, what is to be done.

Shri Mataji: Linda, for your problem, what is the thing to be done? Will you get out of your personal problems or not?Yogini: Yes Mother.Shri Mataji: No, I'm talking to Linda now.

Linda: And, which ones?Shri Mataji: I would suggest you should stay with your mother. She needs you. She's an old woman; she needs you. You must serve her. There's nothing wrong in it.Linda: Very possessive.Shri Mataji: No, no, no. You are inadequate. Not that she is inadequate. You have to serve her.Give her love, affection. She's lonely. She behaves like that because she's lonely. You are inadequate. I wouldn't say to her anything. She never had love and you are the only child she has. You should love her. Give her more love, more affection, and also what she says about Peter, you should do that. Will give her consolation. She's going crazy because of that.Sahaja Yogini: The trouble is, Mother, she said, “It’s like ten years doing Sahaja Yoga.”

Shri Mataji: Let her say. Her saying, nothing matters. You see that's nothing. That's just an escape. Because you are crazy, that's why she thinks like that.Linda: I know that. I don’t blame her of course.Shri Mataji: But you should establish yourself with more patience, with more love and affection. She’ll say: "Do a hundred times Sahaj Yoga." How has she changed her attitude: because when you went there you went crazy. And you are quite crazy sometimes I've seen. First of all you must be a tidy person, neat person, must look after her.You must take up a responsibility of looking after. She's an old woman who has had no love all her life. What she wants is love; and as a child, daughter, you must give her love. Whatever she is, you can't leave her alone. If you give her love, I'm sure you can cure her. Take it up as a challenge and give her a bandhan. Everybody can give her a bandhan and put her right. You cannot be helpless like that to run away from your duties towards your mother, I will never allow you. You can go to Chelsham start a center there, attend it, do it. You have to.Linda: Do you want me actually to live with her?Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: Should she live with her Mother?Shri Mataji: Yes of course, why not? She's your own mother. She's not such a cruel woman. I don't think so. I've seen her. But you get crazy yourself. I know. I know that. This is how you will test yourself.You should live with her - after all she's so old now. What's her age?Linda: Sixty-four, sixty-three.Shri Mataji: See now, at sixty-three if she's left alone in that house, what will she do? You tell her that "I've decided to do what you have told Me about Peter."Linda: She hasn’t really told me anything about Peter. I’ve been doing most of the tellings.Shri Mataji: All right, whatever it is.Linda: She wants to-Shri Mataji: She'll be all right. You see, you try to tell her these things, she'll be all right. You tell her just like this: "And now I'm going to look after you, you are very sick, you're not well. Take care." Did you talk to her kindly sometimes?Linda: Well, I tried.Shri Mataji: No, you did not.You did not, that's what it is. As a Sahaja Yogi you have to be extremely kind and compassionate towards her. She's an old woman, had no love from her husband. She has tried to do something for you always. So as a daughter, you have a duty.

Linda: I’m very worried about Bumble because it’s a sort of 3-cornered arrangement which comes out.Shri Mataji: What happens about Bumble?Linda: Well, Bumble sort of finishes up in between me and her. It’s...Shri Mataji: But if you finish off from yourself, she won't be finishing off like that. See, why do you create a problem between you and her, first of all? There should be no gap. If there is no gap, then there won't be any problem. The problem is because you are a problem and she's a problem, so the child suffers.But if you just have nothing, if she tells, on the contrary, if a child tells anything about your mother, you should say: "Don't say like that to my- she's my mother." Tomorrow she will turn back and tell you that! Take it from Me.Linda: I mean in that way she’sShri Mataji: She's much more sensible in this than you are. You should not tell her anything about your mother. You should say: "She's been very kind to me and nice to me." If it is communicated to her, if through Bumble, things will be all right.See, how long is she going to live with this kind of life she has had. All right?

Where are you going to try your Sahaja Yoga if you can't try on your own mother?Linda: But she wouldn’t have it Mother.Shri Mataji: No that's not the way. It's not outside; it is inside.Linda: I tried to cook for her but she would’nt eat what I cook.Shri Mataji: You don't have to do it outside, you have to do it inside with her. Be kind, be gentle, be of service, at the most she'll shout sometimes, doesn't matter. Forgive her, forgive her.

Linda: I mean she has vomiting, which really worries me.My mother can't sleep at night, wanders around talking to herself the whole time.Shri Mataji: You see, it's all right. If she doesn't sleep, then you can say some mantras in your heart. You know there's a mantra of Nidra and all that ["Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu, Nidra rupena samsthita"]. You put her left to the right, she'll sleep off.You do it all that, she'll sleep. You should say that: “Breathe, three times, heavily you'll sleep off”. And if you, when she's talking also, if you sleep off, she's not going to wake you up again.You just doze off there and she'll say: "All right, you go and sleep now formally."It's very simple to fight out these things. I mean she needs you, very much. She can't sleep. Just imagine, your mother can't sleep. How can you run away from her? Just see her condition. She's your mother.Linda: She is in a terrible state.Shri Mataji: Then how can you leave her? You can't. You can't leave her. No, I wouldn't say that. You can't leave your mother.

You know, Kathy wanted to come with Me. Remember Kathy?Kathy: Yes Mother.Shri Mataji: And I told her, "You can't leave your mother in the hospital, come with Me to India. No, you can't." She missed that thing completely, I told her: "You stay with your mother." She's here, just ask her.Linda: Yes.Shri Mataji: I did tell her. And she was cancer, this thing with the Sahaja Yoga, and all that, and she used to attend to her. She stayed back. No, you can't leave your parents like that, you see. Parents are very important things. After a certain age, you have to look after them. Whatever they are, you must look after your parents. That's very important in Sahaja Yoga. Your Right Heart cannot be all right, Shri Rama cannot be all right if you don't look after your mother.

She's not such a bad woman. I've seen her.I, if she were a very cruel, horrible, this sort of thing, then I would have said: "All right, forget her." She's not that way. But she's not either so much - she's drinking because she has no company, she doesn't know what to do with herself. So she is trying to run away from herself. It's very simple to understand. You be kind and gentle. Give her some value that she's something to you, she'll be all right. I've seen she's not a bad woman.

Lot of her sense has come into you also, her goodness.Linda: I’m bothered I think by – when Grazyna came to stay she felt, Grazyna felt that she had this brother, you see, whom she worshipped. He killed himself in moto racing.She saw him dying in front of her.Shri Mataji: What’s it?Linda: She had this borther, my mother, who she loved very much and-Shri Mataji: That I have heard of already. That story I know, whatever she has done, whatever it is.Linda: She seems very fond of dying [unsure].Doesn't matter. By leaving her, are you going to help her by that? You should fill the position of that brother! You should say, "Doesn't matter, if the brother is dead, I'm here to look after you, mother." Why is she hankering after the brother? She thinks that if the brother had lived he would have looked after her in old age. But God knows if he had looked after, he would have run away, too.Why can't you fill the place of the brother? You can. Why not? You take it up upon yourself. You can do it. I know. All right? You look upon her as you look upon Me. Why not? Just try. It is worth it. It's worth it. Be nice and gentle. Say nice things, pleasant things to her. Show interest in her life. Actually you see all of this has come from these psychologists also. Horrible ones.[Lauhgter]No, they always say: "Mother did something." Everybody I saw they said, "My mother is like .." I said: "How can everybody's mother be so cruel?" Could be some people's, but not everybody's.

And also if they have deviated from right path, it is because they never got their love, they never got their place in life. See, the husbands must have ill-treated them, tortured their lives and must have been after them, or maybe they had some other problems from their parents or something. Everybody's mother has tortured.[Shri Mataji is laughing]It's a psychology, I think. That way a mother is in a way always, if you look at her from a wrong angle, she will look like your enemy.

In the West, the mother picture is horrible. Also wars, things have come in that generation. People have been shattered of their values. You must understand what kind of life this horrible Western society can give to women who are good. Good women are really tortured in this society. Only the smart ones and the ones who are very arrogant and who know how to put men right and women right in their places can exist, you see, this is what it is. It's a regular struggle here.Any good woman is tortured in this society. I mean, if she exists and she really lives, is something surprising. Ask, Maria will tell you. You ask her how they put them down, how they insult them, how - I mean, everybody has seen this happening here. But don't blame the mother all the time. At this stage, you must look after her.Hum.So now what is next?

Sahaja Yogi: Could You marry me and my girlfriend sometime in future?Shri Mataji: What’s it?Another Sahaja Yogi: Marry him and his girl friend.Shri Mataji: Who is your girlfriend?Sahaja Yogi: Oh, she’s not here tonight, she is-Shri Mataji: She's not a Sahaj Yogini?Sahaja Yogi: She comes from Bedfort. Yes, she is a Sahaja Yogini.Shri Mataji: She's a Sahaj Yogini.So you want to have a marriage on Krishna Ashtami? Some of the marriage to be performed? Sahaja Yogi: Yes, please.Shri Mataji: Now when is the Krishna Ashtami?Another Sahaja Yogi: Next Sunday Mother.[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: Some time in the future, not now.[Laughter]Shri Mataji: You see, the best place to get married is in India. Very easy and you have a real feeling because you come on a horse and this and that, you see?

But even if you want to have in Krishna Ashtami day, I don't know if you can get really somebody to do it - if somebody we can get, we should do it if there are people who want to get married.But you see Sahaja Yoga marriage is taken for granted. I've seen people do not have that understanding, and it's very dangerous to play with it, it's very dangerous, you see? So I think if you have some time given to yourself, I will definitely marry.Best thing I think is [to] let people take some time and decide. Because, you see, it's very funny, nobody feels responsible about it. They'll come out with a explanation: "Oh, I didn't understand and I was not in a position to do it, I was still possessed with a bhoot and I married another bhoot."[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: Ah, I’ve lived with her two years.Shri Mataji: With her?Sahaja Yogi: yes, with her.Shri Mataji: You see, you have given sufficient time now. But you see, one thing is their living is in the West, is simple people; but if you tell them "marriage", oh God. They go amok. They go amok. You see, if it's a marriage: "Ahhhhh."Ask David Prole, he'll tell you.[Laughter]

You see, because the law is so horrifyingly funny here, "marriage, oh God, it means horrible things. You have to separate. If you have to divorce- the first thing about a divorce: "You'll have to give so much money. " "Half money the wife will take away." "She'll murder me."[Laughter]You see, they show husband murders wife, wife murders husband, all sorts of things you know all the time it is like going on in this country. It's madness about marriage.So I think it's a good idea. I would like if you can arrange, because Krishna Ashtami's a good time to marry people. Our sixteen marriages, which one has failed? Last time. For the sixteen. No, sixteen here in London. Who were the sixteen people, let's see.All first class. All first class, yah? Yah.Good.So for next marriage lot. Some will be lagging behind like Nick, I would like him to marry. Now you're not so frightened are you? Nick?Nick: No.Shri Mataji: No, it’s good. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]On the Dashera day we can have marriage. The Dashera day, that's another day one can marry. Now Krishna Ashtami and Dashera day. Of course after the Diwali, after the marriage of the Tulasi, then only people start, but the Dashera day is very, very good. It's very auspicious. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

So we'll have marriages on Dashera day. Till then prepare people for marriage. All right? The Dashera will be say about ... end of October, about. All right?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, thank you.Shri Mataji: Let's find out where will I be.So that's how.

Sahaja Yogi [Derek Ferguson]: Mother, I was going to ask, some Sahaja Yogis who’ve been in Sahaja Yoga for a long time don’t feel cool breeze; they don’t feel any catches. Some people feel burning all the time; some people feel these things in their head, in their body, toes, hands. It’s the way we’re gonna develop, where you can feel things - all of us, all over - or is it just some people feel different things?

Shri Mataji: No no. You see, to begin with, you see, it has something to do with your nervous system. All right? So, if your nervous system is disturbed, you may not feel, at all. For the nervous system, best thing is to do massage. You see, somebody should massage their back, hands... Also, I’ve told many a times that you rub your hands with vibrated olive oil, quite a lot, and rub these things, so they become sensitive. Could be with insensitivity. But if they can feel the catches in the body, that means they are all right, only the Vishuddhi is not all right. Rub the thing on the Vishuddhi, work on Vishuddhi, clear it out. And for Vishuddhi, if you can use, say, butter to rub on the- here [neck], and rub all these muscles, you see, with that. All these things will work out, for your hand.

But supposing there’s no cool breeze coming out of the head, possibly. Then the Realization yet not has established. See, other people should say whether there is a cool breeze coming, because the person who is not realized may not feel it. Supposing he does not feel it, and you feel it, then he is realized; only thing, his chakras are to be cleared out. It’s a different different category of people. Then, there are some people whose Kundalini has not risen; they are still Sahaja Yogis. Like that. Maybe. I don’t know if there are any. Those people who are unmarried for long, they are very difficult people because they never feel the cool breeze in the hand, quite a lot. Like that. But it is not so. They are realized souls in any case. They may not feel it, but they are realized souls, you see. Because a kind of a softness, a kind of a balance is developed after marriage - which is not there. And that’s how some people don’t feel it. There are various reasons. Some people who are ego-oriented more - they should turn their left to the right many a times. They should find out... from the hands, you see. One hand is bigger, one hand is smaller. That means the left hand - if it is smaller - that means you have to raise left to the right. You see, from the size of the hands and all that you can see it. Putting one hand towards the photograph, another hand outside... Work it out in so many ways, because you have permutations and combinations of certain mistakes. But that doesn’t mean you develop this Left Vishuddhi by any chance. Because that’s the worst thing that can happen. If you develop the Left Vishuddhi, then it’s a very difficult situation for you. Now, for this kind of a thing, I think I’ll give you a complete lecture on one day. Complete. As to see what permutations and combinations of different chakras can create. All right? But symptoms are outside. The symptoms are mostly outside; there’s no need to... from a personality you can see what it is he is catching, you see. Is a very... problem, great problem with people, that they don’t feel the vibrations; some people just don’t feel it.

How many there are like that, who never feel any vibrations? Never felt, never.Raise your hands. I know Kerry.Kerry: Not never.Shri Mataji: And you never- you have felt it sometimes?Kerry: Yes, yes.Shri Mataji: All right.Second Sahaja Yogi: Mother since I came to the ashram I`ve been, my hands have being very hot all the time.Shri Mataji: Which one?Second Sahaja Yogi: But I feel the catches inside.Shri Mataji: Both the hands are.What work you are doing in the ashram?Sahaja Yogi: Not very much Mother.Shri Mataji: All right, you had a left side catch. All right, you can see clearly your right hand is very shining. The left, there is a problem. You see these fingers are not so shining as the things are. You had a left side problem, if you remember it. All right? So, that's fighting. In the ashram the vibrations are fighting, that's why you feel hot. There's nothing wrong with it.It will correct; it will have cool breeze. Put your right hand always up and left hand towards Me. It will correct you.

Shri Mataji: When did you come?Sahaja Yogi: (Italian) Last Wednesday.Shri Mataji: Oh I see. You’re staying here in the ashram?Sahaja Yogi: No he is not here in the ashram.Shri Mataji: No. Where is he staying?Sahaja Yogi: In a Hotel.Shri Mataji: Why don’t you stay here and get your Sahaja Yoga alright? He’s from...now better. Alright.Sahaja Yogi: He’ll come tomorrow to the ashram.Shri Mataji: Good idea.[In Hindi Shri Mataji asks someone if they are ok]So now, can I go now?

Sahaja Yogi: We should offer You a sari.Shri Mataji: This is Gavin’s idea of a sari, isn’t it? What color is this?[PHRASE IN HINDI] What’s it? What a beautiful one! Where did you take this one? It’s like a painting. Where?Sahaja Yogi: Sahasrara Puja in Paris.Shri Mataji: In Paris? It’s beautiful! It’s for Me or for the ashram?Sahaja Yogi: He has brought it to You, Mother.Shri Mataji: Thank you. It’s too beautiful. Very beautiful it is. Thank you.May God bless you.You’ll stay here for sometime?

Sahaja Yogi: A week, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Week, all right, good. Christine, then I’ll come and see you all, Americans, eh? Here, Monday. And we’ll discuss about what is to be done in the future program. Now. Anything?

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I have brought You a present.

Shri Mataji: Present?

Sahaja Yogi: For small [THING?]. Some photographs.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. I would like to see. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? This is Italian style. See? Is Italian. They make everything so beautiful. [PHRASE IN HINDI] It’s very loving and nice. You had taken this photograph? And enlarged it? Beautiful it is. Very gentle and nice. This is from that garden... which I didn’t see? It’s beautiful lotuses Rustem has in Derbyshire. In Derbyshire, I couldn’t see that [ONE?], really. I was surprised, they say that you can’t grow a lotus here. I don’t know how they do it, really.

Sahaja Yogini: They call them something else, that sort of...

Shri Mataji: Must be. See this one. [PHRASE IN HINDI] [PHRASE IN HINDI] So beautiful they are. Rustem, you have become a great photographer.

Sahaja Yogi: He’s got four years experience.

Sahaja Yogi: They grow in Hampstead, Mother, too.

Shri Mataji: Hampstead?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they are in the ponds in Hampstead [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: I don’t know how they manage it, you see, this cold. It’s tremendous. But they grow in the cold because [UNCLEAR] also they have these. So, must be.

Sahaja Yogi: They can grow in the cold, no problem.

Shri Mataji: Now... [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] Now, Harry, your problem is solved?

Sahaja Yogi: Not as yet, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Why? What happened?

Sahaja Yogi: I called my employers, and they said that they’ve not quite sorted whether they should re-employ me. So they gave me one week. He said he will call me back next week.

Shri Mataji: Or you just go and tell them that “You give me just an employment,” saying that “for only three months at the most.”

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: But just say that “We give you employment, we re-employ you,” that’s all.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I’ll go to there.

Shri Mataji: What else?

Sahaja Yogi: These ladies are too shy, Mother, to tell them to come in.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Sahaja Yogi: Some ladies to give You the sari, Mother.

Shri Mataji: To give Me a sari? All right. This is the one that puja sari Gavin has brought. Who will give Me? Give it now. Come along, you girls. Also he has brought one sari for Me, which I... use it on Janmashtami also, from... [PHRASE IN HINDI] from Bombay. May God bless you. How is he? Did he get a job?

Sahaja Yogini: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: What did he say? He’s not [UNCLEAR]?

Sahaja Yogi: He got a job, he is the head of all the translators in Spain.

Sahaja Yogini: He called me last Tuesday, he said, head of... in the embassy... of the translate people.

Sahaja Yogi: The chief translator, is the head of the translation stuff in the embassy.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Sahaja Yogini: He says he has a big responsibility now, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Good. How much is he paid? How much is he paid?

Sahaja Yogini: 240 pounds.

Shri Mataji: How much?

Sahaja Yogini: 240 pounds per month.

Shri Mataji: Two thousand?

Sahaja Yogini: Two hundred.

Shri Mataji: And forty pounds. Per month.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s very reasonable course, Spanish [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: For Spain, it is. It is very reasonable.

Sahaja Yogini: Also, he’s work only six hours a day.

Shri Mataji: And where does he live?

Sahaja Yogini: He stay with Jose Antonio.

Shri Mataji: He’s happy there? It’s good that he’s got such a good job. All right. What is this you have done?

Sahaja Yogini: Michelle made it, Mother. It’s a [CROWN HERE?], Mother.

Shri Mataji: This you give Me on Krishnashtami, will be better. Isn’t it, with this thing?

Sahaja Yogini: Michelle made it, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Michelle? Should give Me on Krishnashtami, all right? It’s beautiful. All right. So just open the sari and put it on [UNCLEAR].

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, may I read Your hundred and eight names? May I read Your hundred and eight names? [IN WRITTEN?] shlokas.

Shri Mataji: Who? You?

Sahaja Yogi: Your names, yes.

Shri Mataji: Please, let read it out. Loudly. You have to raise it higher. Let Me garland [UNCLEAR]. It’s beautiful color. Thank you. It’s very sweet of the doctor Singh to give such a nice job to him Don, isn’t it? He’s a great man, doctor Singh. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] But we wanted some really Sahaja Yogi to go there. He knows Spanish also. But the doctor Singh is taking so much interest, I must say.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, but it’s only for three months.

Shri Mataji: All right. Yes, that’s what he said, that three months [IT IS?]. That’s it. It may go further.

Sahaja Yogi: He will have excellent reference after that work.

Shri Mataji: Now he can go to other places. He’s not so attached to anything; I found it from him. You see, Don is a very deep Sahaja Yogi, very deep. And he said, “I’m not so particular about Spain. Any place You send me, Mother, I’ll be going.” So he’s not so much attached to... he’s a very deep person. That was a good answer. So he can go somewhere else if he says,”It’s not that I get attached to Spain.” Let’s see. But you better grow now. Did he tell you what is the problem is? And must learn proper English, you see? That’s very important because Sahaja Yoga... I cannot speak all the languages. So better try to learn. In here, people should teach English to people who don’t know good English, all right? Not that English language is God’s language, but at least I understand it. Otherwise, all the English will have [A BIG EGO?]. And I can’t learn so many languages, all right? Try to learn English language and, also, understand Sahaja Yoga mentally. That’s important. Because you have to explain to people, talk to them. Because you talk, but it makes no sense on the other people if you have not mentally equipped. Those who are just attached to Sahaja Yoga with heart must equip themselves also with mind, must understand Sahaja Yoga with mind, is very important. And those who only understand with mind should understand it with heart. All right?

Sahaja Yogini: To reading “The Advent”, Mother, is very useful, very helpful to overcome this problem, because I had the same problems.

Shri Mataji: All right. Try to read “Advent”, explain to her, let her understand. How are you? You never came to the...

Sahaja Yogi: Unfortunately, I had to work.

Shri Mataji: I see.

Sahaja Yogi: But I [FORGET TO LET YOU KNOW?].

Shri Mataji: All right. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] [UNCLEAR] mangalsutra? You got two? One will sufficient, one you keep it for the next puja. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] You must get one made in gold. When I go to India, I’ll get you one. It should be used for puja. [PHRASE IN HINDI] And the same can be used every time. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, please forgive us for any mistakes we’ve made during Your puja.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Make a list now, and get it verified sometimes. And make a complete list, you see; so whenever you go there, try to remember. You keep one ready. Otherwise, don’t ask for it. Because it goes little funny there, isn’t it? Doesn’t look all right. Because you are such matured Sahaja Yogis. It is all right for children to make mistakes, but you are all matured people, so - doesn’t look nice. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, for Hampstead we do not know so much the protocol of pujas and how to... to behave in... there is no [ASPECTS TOWARDS YOU?]. Then, how do You suggest we should educate ourselves?

Shri Mataji: Next time when I’ll give you a lecture on this, all right? Because requires a real one big lecture, Maria. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, someone is bringing You some food. Food is being brought, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No. You see, My family people are going to have food with Me. I’m sorry. They are all at home. I’m sorry, I have to go.
