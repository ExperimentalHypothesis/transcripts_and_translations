Evening program, Classical Vina Recital, Bangalore (India), December 8, 1991

[Shri Matajiâ€™s speech at 1:53:10]

[Applause]We are all so very thankful to you for rendering such a meditative instrument like this holy vina. They know about vina and they know that this is one of the Adhivaadyas [primordial instruments]. Also mridangam [percussions] is an Adhivaadya and ghatam also is Adhivaadya. I must congratulate the South Indian music style in which they have maintained those Adhivaadya.[ ... ]
