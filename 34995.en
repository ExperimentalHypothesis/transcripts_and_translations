Miracles In Sahaja Yoga

Please stop, we cannot [unsure].

That we had such miracles in India when I was doing up My house. I had made a staircase in India. We put up in the banisters that they call it banister, that’s the place I’ve measured and think about it, entirely thought. And we have one Sahaja Yogi, [Pradhan] who is a carpenter, who was trying to put it up. So, I said, ‘All right, I’m resting now, here, just try.” And when I got up after half an hour it was still unfit. I said, “What happened?” “Mother, it cannot be fitted. It’s too long. Otherwise how can I fit?” “It cannot be fitted?” “No. How to cut it? Because if we cut it the pattern is not. How we’ll manage?” “I said, “Very simple.” I asked him, “Just hold it, this way, that way, just hold it and cut it with it.” See the wisdom part how it has fitted.” I’ve got it paid in India and measurement was not that I’ve taken like that, I’ve made up, you see.

Second thing that happened that we were, you see, we had to put some marble on the ground floor, the basement, and that can be of some sort of a style that cannot be put by anybody. And three, four Sahaja Yogis had come from Rome. And they said, “Mother, you must tell us something to be done. After all, everybody has worked and we want to do something.” I said, “Will you put the marble?” They said, “Marble we have never done.” I said, “All right, let’s try.” So, they took that thing. They said, “All right, we are putting the marble.” Then everything was upside down like that, you see, absolutely. So, I said, “Don’t you worry. It will all fit into a very wonderful face.” They said, “How?” I said, “Just stay out.” It was so badly off that nobody could walk, you see. It was so uneven, like, this way, that anybody walk this way, it will come out that way, it will. So, they sat down. I said, “You just sit here,” and I walked round and round, three, four times, three and a half times, I should say. And everything fitted, cracked into one. If you see the marble you won’t believe. And, but the best part was that they said that all the cement is over. “There is no cement. Very little cement is left and these shops are closed now for two days. We can’t get it.” I said, “You just go on pouring water.” There were needed two bags full of cement. But with that little cement, they did all the cement in. And it’s perfect, absolutely perfect.

And then they had a problem. They wanted to move a very big wardrobe, very heavy. Indian ‘s, you see, furniture is very heavy, rosewood. And they were all, “Haa,” all of them, [doing]. So, I said, “It’s very simple.” They said, “How?” I just put My finger like this. It just moved, you know, they were surprised.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Six of us trying to push this huge wardrobe, almost the length of that carving.

Shri Mataji: More than it.

Sahaja Yogi: We had about fifteen-foot-long, huge, and full of material, it wasn’t empty. We, we couldn’t move it. We wanted to get behind it because there was some path for lick in and we have probably been there for half an hour, couldn’t move it, and Shri Mataji came in and said, “What are you doing?” We said, “We are trying to fix this lick, Mother. We were trying to move this.” As, as I saw She, She pushed Her little finger.

Shri Mataji: No, no, this one. That is too much. This is sufficient. Had it pushed and they were surprised, how it has moved. So, you see, it is nothing difficult. It’s all possible. You all can do it also. Not difficult. I want all of you to have all the powers that are possible. But first thing, heart. Clean your hearts. Dedication in the hearts should be complete. There should be no reservations. If you have reservations, these things won’t work out. They’ve got houses, they have got jobs, they have got money, everything like that. Then they start thinking, “We must be kings and queens to get it.”

[Laughter.]

Sahaja Yogis: It’s a joke. It’s a joke whom I laugh.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] It is such. So many miracles that you can’t imagine! The best one is now, I think, among all of them, we got aid for forty-two acres of land in Vaitarna, forty-two acres of land, surrounded by three rivers. We can say one, one is a brook, another is a river, another is the big Vaitarna, for only eighty thousand rupees. This is the best I could say. I can’t go any further with it. Like Rome, Rome, Rome, they wanted to have a place for ashram, and they said, “Who will give us an ashram place? Nobody gives on rent, you see. They have, they won’t give it to so many people, this, that.” I said, “Try. You give an advertisement or something.” They gave an advertisement. And one fellow appeared saying that his wife is dead and he doesn’t want to stay in the suburbs. He wants to move to Rome city. So, he has a house. If they want, they can have it. So, it was taken in, they said, only one person’s name. This fellow never asked, “How many are going to stay there? How many are going to pay for it? How you are going to pay? What is your guarantee?” “Nothing.” He said, “Take the house.” First, he said a price, and somehow or other I don’t know what happened to him that he said, “All right, for half the price”. And it’s so cheaply they got it. It’s a huge hall with eleven bedrooms on it and four bathrooms and I think two WC, and outside house are at least? how many acres of land?

Sahaja Yogini: Two acres, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Extra.

Sahaja Yogi: Wow.

Shri Mataji: Same with Hounslow house. They got a house in Hounslow. They bought it. And other house which was semi-detached you see, the neighbour’s. So, they thought if they can get the neighbour’s house, then they can get a land together and they can get a nice hall built there. So, Gavin said, “Mother, I have to sell this house and that house was donated to Me by the Mother.” I said, “Baba, I don’t want any house, anything to Me. You better use that money for some ashram.” So, he said, “Mother, but the house is not yet selling and the other neighbour is not willing to give us.” I said, “Sell the house first.” The day the house was sold the neighbour who had refused to sell the house to him, herself came to him and said, “Do you want to purchase the house?”

[Audio : Continued]

One day, Kuli this Tony, the first Sahaja Yogi, he came to Me and he said, “Mother, I’m little running short of money.” I said, “Should I give you?” He said, “No, no, I don’t want any money from You.” I said, “All right, you will get it.” He went back to his flat. So, there he found two thousand pounds in base floor. And these were, these two thousand pounds were the notes of 1964 because they celebrated the anniversary of, hundred years anniversary of Shakespeare and they printed on Shakespeare’s life, you see. All the notes were that.

I didn’t steal any money.

Shri Mataji: [Laughter]

That’s how it works out. If you are having any problem, then you must know there must be something wrong. Better meditate. Better do something to cleanse yourself and things will work out. Maybe your left Nabhi is catching, right Nabhi catching, maybe something catching. So, work it out. If you are clean in Sahaja Yoga it will work out. All right.

And we have problems,

1:27

we have solved problems of such a dimension that you can’t believe it. Rajesh’s factory was on strike for one and a half year.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Yes. And I went to India and Rajesh said, “Mother, what to do about this factory? I don’t know what to do. I’m going mad with it.” I said, “Doesn’t matter. Is going to help you very much.” He said, “How?” I said, “It is going to help Sahaja Yoga and it is going to help us.” He said, “How?” I said, “You do one thing. You decide to have a Ganesha’s temple there built, Ganesha’s temple. In Maharashtra Ganesha’s temple means everybody is finished there.

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] So, he had a Ganesha Puja arranged there. All the labour class people came for the Ganesha Puja. Because for Maharashtrians, you can’t avoid Ganesha Puja there. And the factory started. Factory started and when they saw Ganesha Puja being done actually in the family, Rajesh thought that nobody would like to come because they are all Jains. So, the ladies in the house said, “Why didn’t you call us for the Puja? Everybody is coming so we are coming.” So, they all came for Puja. And in the Puja when these people came they said that, “We want to have our Realization.” So, most of the labours, they have got Realization.

Sahaja Yogi: Wow.

Shri Mataji: Now other factory people where the factories have closed now because of strikes, want to have Realization. So, we’ll solve the problem of Bombay city of all the strikes and we’ll restart all the machineries which have been stopped for years now.

3:14

Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] See, Dutta Samanth was so powerful in his thing. Now these people from his factory don’t want to see his face. He is finished. Next election he cannot win.

Sahaja Yogi: He’s a goonda.

Shri Mataji: Ha?

Sahaja Yogi: Course Rajesh has given him Realization, he’s a goonda.

Shri Mataji: Ha? He’s finished now. You see, some people are to be finished and some people are to be given Realization. Everybody can. Best was Warren’s experience. Did he tell you?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, the car run without the gas.

Shri Mataji: Ha. About that.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So, all these things are happening, there are blessings, but we must also be able to receive that blessing. As he was saying he got his Green Card without his wife.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Karan, really.

Shri Mataji: He’s sitting there.

Sahaja Yogi: Is really a miracle.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] So now, you should think, you see, about what questions these people are capable of asking and how will you answer them. That’s how you’ll be prepared. Because it’s not sufficient to be Realized, it’s not sufficient to be established, but you must have the complete know-how and you must have the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

Otherwise, you see, anybody comes in, “Go to Gavin”. You should be able to explain. You should be able to talk about them. But if you are still busy with only your personal problems, how will you do that?

I must tell you another miracle because I remembered of Yogi Mahajan. Yogi, poor thing, you know, he’ll plan and land himself with the difficulties. So, he’s told Me, “We have got this book published Mother, such good photographs of yours, it’s like a Madonna, and I’ve put that thing around You.” I said, “All right. Let’s see what is done.” So, when I saw the photograph I said, “What’s this nonsensical photo you have? From where did you get it?” So, he said, “You don’t like?” I said, “See the vibrations. That’s the main point. Is a horrible photograph. This is, this is not Me. Somebody has taken the photograph. So, he’s not all right.” [He touched it]. He said, “Mother, but I’m all right.” “I’ll tell you just now, in one minute who must have taken it,” I said. “Jane, Gavin’s wife. Has she taken the photograph?” He looked at Me, so golly face [unclear]. “How do you know, Mother?” I said, “I can tell you.” “This Jane brought it to Me and gave it to Me. It’s My photograph you’re publishing, it’s [inaudible], how do I tell you?”

Sahaja Yogini: This is the one in the centre?

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

Sahaja Yogini: The picture of the, the bristol [unsure] of centre?

Shri Mataji: Absolutely hopeless. Doesn’t matter, Celine. You see, for bhootish people may be all right.

[Laughter]

Like we went to Scotland and I saw a photograph. We went to have our lunch somewhere and I saw My photograph, I said to [inaudible]. “Who’s done this one?” They said, “This is the same as came from Australia.” I said, “This is not the same. It’s something else.”

So, I said, “Now, I’ll tell you who did this. So, it’s a copy of the same.” They said, “Yes, it’s a copy.” So, I said, “I know who has done it.” They said, “Who?” I said, “Hillary.” We telephoned to Gavin. I said, “Did Hillary send you this photograph?” “Yes, Mother. And she wouldn’t allow me to show You. She said, ‘Now, we are in a hurry. Let us print it.’” But that, that photograph had such bhoots in it, that all the bhoots of Scotland came for My program.

I was fed up with them and everybody disappeared also with the same speed.

He gets stuck with people who really give him a good experience also, Yogi Mahajan. Now he’s improving.

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: Little better?

8:06

Shri Mataji: Like we had this Hari. Now this should not be on the tape. It’s all personal. Mister Hari, the great.

[Cut in the audio.]

Otherwise then now what are you doing? “We are feeling guilty.” I said, “Now please don’t commit sin of [inaudible]

feeling of the left Vishudhi. [Hindi] They feel guilty. Why don’t you come in the centre? Why do you feel guilty about it? Cleanse it. This is what you should do.”

[Conversation in Hindi]
