I want you to resolve that you all will become absolutely ‘Dharmik’. It is hard to be a ‘Dharmik’. The Society and environment force you to be Adharmik. You are born in innocence and later you go on compromising and accepting Adharmic patterns as normal.

For a Sahaja Yogi, it is difficult to be Adharmic. If he tries to do a wrong thing, he is corrected by the vibrations. But if you go on killing your awakened conscience. You are free to do so and kill all your chances of ascent.

In Sahaja Yoga you have to forget the past as you have been bathed with Divine Love, like a newly born baby. Purity of Heart expressed as fidelity in marriage for both husband and wife is the most enjoyable virtue and is the most powerful. When you understand the purity of relationship, you enjoy them the most.

Steady your attention Joy keeping your attention on the Mother earth. Thus you get the loving 'Bandhan' of your Grandmother and you become free of enslavement to your lust.
