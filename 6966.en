Talk to yogis. Alpe Motta (Italy), 3 May 1986.

... that he leaves his bed in a mess. He leaves all his things in a mess. While coming I saw all the beds. ... What are you doing here? Nothing. So put yourself into a discipline of leading a neat life, as a Mother I have to tell you. It takes hardly 10 to 15 minutes, but just tell yourself, 'This is meditation.' Do it meditatively. We in India think that the western people are extremely neat and tidy. Really, they can't believe. They think you are on top of the world, you must be the neatest people ever been. They say ten times 'thank you' - but even once you will not keep your bed all right. Your things should be neat. You must keep yourselves ...

Then second thing I have seen, noticed, is which is told by many people, which I have also noticed, that you go to somebody's house then an ill-bred person will start using the phone without asking. Certain things are important to understand. Like entering into the kitchen, eating everything. It's a very common thing people have noticed, is this; that you get the food like paupers, like beggars - they come in the house. I had twenty-one bottles of honey, which people had given me as present, and when my son-in-law came, there was not even one bottle to give him honey. So who ate? All the Sahaj Yogis who came ate the honey. I mean, it's all right. But you must ask. You polish up every thing in the house. All right, you have come, there is food cooked for you. Just have your food. You go in the larder or you go anywhere to find everything is missing. You buy for the whole month, you find everything is polished off. So an ill-bred person can be made out like this. But you will be surprised, a good breeding person, even if this much is left of another person, that person will keep it and keep it, till it is passed on. I will tell you about My own husband, who is ... he need not worry about these things. But if he knows we have some thing of another person he will put it in lock and key and see every time it is there, till he returns it. And same I can say about My children or anybody I know of. But this is beggarish that you take somebody's things, misuse it, throw away where you feel like, break everything.

But I have seen with My own things, so when the leaders have been complaining to Me that they come to our houses, they polish off everything from our fridges and all that; I was not surprised. Sahaja Yoga has become like a resort for all the beggars and the paupers of the world, because it is free. All the poor people come down to Sahaja Yoga and you have to nourish them and look after them. It should not be such. You may be poor but you must have dignity. Even the servants in India are better. They wouldn't touch anything without asking. They have much more breeding. An ill-bred person is a person is who is a rude person, arrogant person. You can say the same thing in a proper manner. As a Mother to give Me real glory is that people should say that you are very well brought up children. [PAUSE]

A kind of system must exist.. A Spartan system. It's a Spartan system; it's not all sort of a lousy system. [largesse?] It's a Spartan system. You are yogis, should be neat tidy, all the time clean with few things. Like in India people are quite shocked. You carry such big, big bags and it carries all the ..., for the ladies especially all the paints and this and that. Where are you going to use before the villagers? There, these paints? They don't understand. All these things we have to see for ourselves. We have to be dignified. We have to be people with a kind of a personality. Supposing somebody is a saint. He might be a poor man, but you can make him out by his deeds. There was a saint called Tukarama, which you have heard about him. His Amibi Gadolo [?], [UNCLEAR] is coming from his music. He was poor and very generous also. He used to give away everything and always left with very little. So, Shivaji Maharaj, the great Shivaji, came down to his place, brought lots of ornaments and things and presentations and gave it to his wife and children. He was out. She was very happy to wear all these things because he gave. He said, this is, of course in the beginning she also said that it's not all right. He said, "No. I am just trying to, sort of, pay my respects to you," this, that, and gave it. And she wore it.

He came and he said, "No! I am a saint. You take this. You are a king and you have to live like a king; all right as a king you can have it. But not, as a saint, I don't need all these things; my wife doesn't need all these things. Because you are living like a king, may be, you are a realized soul also, but you are a king so live like a king."

But one has to realize that in Sahaja Yoga you are not to move like a barren personality also. You have to be properly dressed, properly appearing. You should not look like beggars. But you should look like dignified people of the society. Now for example, as you know I am the Goddess and the Goddess has to wear, I don't know how many ornaments, just to adore Her chakras. I have lots of ornaments Myself, of My own. But only for Puja I wear otherwise I don't wear. I am supposed to wear lots of these things. Why? Because it may not be that all right, may be dignified but may not be that all right to wear all those things all the times, but I am supposed to wear. Like you are supposed to wear many more things in the hand here, rings on the feet, everything all the time, you have to wear gold in the ...what you call the ... I don't have that ornament here, like a belt. I don't do it. I keep it to marginal point. Only in India I wear some things.

So you must have the discretion. What to wear? How to wear? How far to go? How to look dignified? How to be well-bred? So that you glorify the breeding of your Mother. This time I hope when you all come to India, you will notice all these things among Indians. You will never see them eating, you will never see them having their baths. You will never see them sleeping. You don't know how they live? Where they live? How they work out everything. They are just there on the spot, whenever you want them. Isn't it true? They take their baths; they finish everything early in the morning at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock at that hour, spot. And always clean, whether he is a villager, whether he is a scheduled caste or a brahmin or any thing, they are all neatly dressed up. You can not make them .... Clean white clothes they wear, clean white cap they will have. They never have dirty clothes. So this is another side, which is not so sublime - but gross side. It's not so subtle but is very good, because whatever is in the subtle, expresses out.

In all your behavior you should shine like thousand facets of a diamond, because you have attended now this Sahasrar day. Let's see. One of the thousand facets is patience. Love each other, respect each other, respect yourself and all the time, say one month, say within yourself that, 'I am a Sahaja Yogi'. He says everything about your responsibilities. What are your aspirations? What you are? You are a Sahaja Yogi, being reborn by the Adi Shakti, Herself. Any personal problems you have, you should write to Me and I will try to answer. If I do not answer then think that answer I have managed. If I do not answer then think that I have managed the answer. But if there is any thing is to be suggested, I will definitely inform you. Any other thing?

Like a lady today came, she was crying about her husband. This she did before also, again today she is crying. She will go mad. A Sahaja Yogi should not cry. Overcome your problems. Try to handle your husband, try to handle everything. I do not very much like the divorce part of it, but if somebody is a gone case, it's all right. If I see it's a gone case, you divorce. But unnecessarily just because there is not yet proper understanding, one should not cry, weep and do all these things. And on the contrary one should try to overcome your own personal problems, because you have powers. And you can write to Me, not very long letters. I get lost. Yes really I get lost. In the morning there are so many letters, for Me to read, one better than the other and My husband also gets a bit lost. But he says nobody writes Me love letters they all write about their bills to be paid. I said, "It's just the same." [Applause] You may translate this into Italian:

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji "Full of problems ...."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji, "I said that I have to pay for their love. That's what it is. But children write very sweet letters. They just paint some painting or something or some flowers and few things there, that's how they make a heart and put Me there. But something likes that. Very sweet, sweet thing they do and just the joy and happiness they express, never their problems. They have no problems. Children don't have any problems. They are not complicated. They catch hold of the problems. That's the trouble. They have no problems of any kind. So you have not told me, anyone of you, anything that you want to be done. Now only thing at the last I would like you to listen to Warren who will read it out to you the programs, we are going to have in these summer times.

[A Sahaja Yogi reads out the program, with some corrections and suggestions, in between, made by Shri Mataji]

Sahaja Yogi: "So Shri Mataji's program for the rest of Italy I think is known, She returns to the UK You are returning on Monday morning, Shri Mataji?"

Shri Mataji: "Yes."

Sahaja Yogi: "Monday morning. Then She comes to France on seventh eighth and returns on the twenty second not the twenty fourth as written in the plan. [NOT VERY CLEAR AND NOT AUDIBLE] The next program is in June on the 7th June. [CONVERSATION OF SAHAJA YOGI AND SHRI MATAJI ABOUT PROGRAMS]"

Shri Mataji, "We have to thank the nature for creating such a beautiful stage for Sahaja Yogis - from all over Europe and England, Australia and India."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji, "Specially you have to thank Lido and his wife and all the Italian Sahaja Yogis who have worked as a team to organize this beautiful place for us. Come down here, visit and see the glory that is of the Creator."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji, "The nature has organized everything so well and also the symbolism of this place is so expressive."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "That the three main rivers of Europe- just like Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, Maha Saraswati- flow from this place all over."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji, "On our way while coming we saw the temple of the three medals [?] [UNCLEAR]

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji, "and the place is also called as the 'Mount of the Mother'."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "And we have seen the beautiful huge big statue of the Mother in golden color, just in front of this hotel."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "So the stage is laid very well as in a drama"

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "They describe outside, what is the play about. They put up different posters and statues to describe the play."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "So you are on the stage. You are the actors".

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Whatever you are taught, whatever you have learnt, whatever you have experienced, has to be manifested."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "That manifestation is the one what we call as the performance."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji, "So if we are Sahaja Yogis and if we have achieved an ascent, our performance will show that."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "So your performance tomorrow will prove how much you have achieved so far and how good you have reached."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "The performance of the nature is ultimately joy giving."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "It nourishes, it teaches, it does everything; but ultimately it gives you joy."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "So you have reached a stage now where performance within and without has to be witnessed."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Here we are more than five hundred people, all bound together with love."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "We do not belong to any particular sect or to any particular race or caste."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "We belong to that special category which is called as saints."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "But the modern saints are very humble."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "And they don't accept this special position they have - with showing off."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "But you are all saints."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "And tomorrow we will see what happens to these saints."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "No, once you got in anyway, we frighten about anything "

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "But it's a surprise."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "What a magnificent, joy giving surprise!"

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "It's all right. Today I have a small little present for Lido and his wife."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "It's a big present."

[CLAPPING] [UNCLEAR] [JAIKARA] [IT APPEARS THAT THE GIFT IS BEING UNWRAPPED -ED.]

Shri Mataji: "Now there is a big present, which is coming for the Ashram."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Very big - in nine boxes."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "... But you have to guess. Italians have to guess"

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "There are nine light trees [??], from all over the world."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Italians come along."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Three chances. Three chances to....First of all get these."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Three chances." [UNCLEAR]

Sahaja Yogi: "OK what is the first guess?"

Another Sahaja Yogi: "[UNCLEAR] Nomsey"

Shri Mataji, "Nomsey!! No. No. [UNCLEAR]"

Sahaja Yogi: "[UNCLEAR] Statues?"

Shri Mataji: "No"

Sahaja Yogi: "[UNCLEAR]"

Shri Mataji: "What did he say?"

Sahaja Yogi: "Nothing."

Shri Mataji: "What did he say?"

Sahaja Yogi, "Nothing ... He was not qualified Mother"

Shri Mataji: "Tabla?"

Sahaja Yogi: "... Instrument of music?"

Shri Mataji: "No"

Sahaja Yogi: "OK. So the presents are lost."

[LAUGHS AND APPLAUSE]

Shri Mataji, "These are chandeliers. These are chandeliers of My first drawing room, with sixteen globes in it, fourteen globes I think or sixteen, and also there are side lights. They are packed so well, that's why in nine boxes. But they are quite big, large; look nice there pink and solid ones. You remember Mine."

[JAIKARA AND CLAPPING]

Shri Mataji: "[UNCLEAR]There is a photograph of these with someone. I will tell you who had it. These people, who brought it, had got photographs."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Right, the photographs? You have?"

Sahaja Yogi: "Yes"

Shri Mataji: "But the lamp shade will be too small. This is a smaller part. There is a bigger part also. [NOT CLEAR] ... This one you can show them. These are the ones. ... You have seen that. One you take it out carefully. You have to be very ... It is very, very dainty [NOT CLEAR]"

Sahaja Yogi: "Photograph."

Shri Mataji: "It's a photograph? ... Because you must have the photograph to rearrange it otherwise you cannot do it. I will have to help you then. It's a huge thing like that, so big as that. It will be nice for your house, yes, the Ashram there."

Sahaja Yogi: "You have to give us a bigger house."

Shri Mataji: "This is, just take out one globe, like that I think there are fourteen or sixteen globes."

[UNCLEAR DIALOGUES OF SAHAJA YOGIS WITH SHRI MATAJI, WHILE TRYING TO ASSEMBLE THE CHANDELIER] [CLAPPING]

Sahaja Yogi: "This is one for each Ashram. That means sixteen Ashrams in Italy."

Shri Mataji: "It has taken three days to pack. They are delicate things you know; you have to be careful with them. They are lead crystals and very good things. They have lasted for so many days and I am sure, they are going to last.

Sahaja Yogi: "These have been packed by Golden Packers? Shri Mataji we really don't have appropriate word to thank You. We really don't know how to thank You.

Shri Mataji: "This is the age of enlightenment and you have to have lights."

Sahaja Yogi: "It is so beautiful."

Shri Mataji: "They look very beautiful. And you have side-lamps also. I think six, six side lamps and these two are very full of fourteen or something. I don't know how many are there. But they are getting the photographs. Have you got scotch tape or some thing to stick? [NOT CLEAR] Somebody has to take it very carefully so that you can close it also or you can put the things back on it. [NOT CLEAR] [PAUSE] That's all, that's all. I told you. I think the other things also you can put on top and [NOT CLEAR].

Thank you. She knows that I am crazy about flowers so she was giving Me . That's good. Very nice. One side we have put lighter things because otherwise people will put it other way round. That's why. Good, but how will you take this to Rome"

Sahaja Yogi: "By bus."

Shri Mataji, "You have a bus. So it should be transported only by that bus otherwise it will go back to England."

[LAUGHS AND PAUSE]

Shri Mataji: "Who are the new people here, who have not met Me before, Italians?"

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian Translation]

Shri Mataji: "So at least I shake hands with you."

Sahaja Yogi: [Italian Translation] [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: "So beautiful, they don't look new, they look age old. Very beautiful. May God bless you. Be seated. Now I will be going to other countries respectively. I don't know how one after another. But there I hope to meet all the new people of that country. But I must say that I was very much enamored to hear that eighteen people have come from Spain."

[CLAPPING] [Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Because Spain is a very far off country, very far off country from here and it was very, very, very sweet of them to have come for Sahasrar Puja."

[Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "Also I am very happy to know that there are twenty people from Germany"

[CLAPPING] [Sahaja Yogi: Italian translation]

Shri Mataji: "There are, they said that the whole of Sahaja Yogis, all of Sahaja Yogis, the whole party has come from Switzerland. It's a great thing."
