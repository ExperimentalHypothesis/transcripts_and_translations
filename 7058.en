Public Program Day 1. Paris (France), 10 July 1989.

Till 7.13 yogis singing Uday ga ambe (Marathi devotional song)

Thank you very much.

8.00

I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

It is to be understood that Truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualise it. We cannot achieve it by our human efforts or mental projections. We have to reach into a higher state to know it. To know it.

This song that they sung just now was written in the year in 1600 in India by a very famous poet, Namadeva was a tailor. Aside to Patrick: Loud. In the 16th century. And they’ve been singing this song in the villages of India with the same folk tune. It says that I will ask for Yoga, that is, the union with the Divine from Mother. ‘Aai’ is the mother. I’ll ask the Mother to give me the Yoga. And the ‘uday uday ambe’ means that ‘O Mother Kundalini! Please rise, uday uday! Please rise!’. So this knowledge of our roots was known to many people all over the world, especially in India to many saints. This Namadeva once went to meet another saint who was a potter, making things out of clay. His name was Gora. He saw him and then he says, in very beautiful couplet he describes this personality of a potter. He says I came here to see the formless that is this all-pervading power, but I see it in person, in form. And he embraced with great joy. This is the acknowledgement. This is the knowledge of a saint about another saint. There’s no jealousy. There is no competition. There’s no knowledge to be asked about the person. Just through this emission of vibrations of cool breeze of the Holy Ghost you can understand who is the saint.

So the time has come for us to know the Truth. I call it the Blossom Time when there are so many people who are seeking the Truth. Of course it’s a living process of a living energy of a living God. You cannot pay for anything that is living process. Like we sprout a seed in the Mother Earth, your Kundalini sprouts spontaneously. And you get the blessings of the Divine Power. It is a all-pervading divine power about which all the scriptures have talked. Essence of all the religions is that seek the eternal, and transitory is to be treated with understanding in its own limitations.

But, when we see the problems of religion and religious people we start wondering what is this all about. One may be a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, any religion, commits any sin, there’s no binding on him. Nobody says that see, I am of this religion I can’t commit this mistake. Then on one side you see the fanaticism. On another side you see people criticizing God, all the great prophets. Because they don’t understand Divinity. And this has led to a great confusion in these modern times, so we have to ascend and know the Absolute. And the Absolute Truth.

In the west as you see, we have so many modern things and we have evolved like a tree, outside. But we do not know what roots, unless and until the tree knows the roots, there is always a danger of this destruction. That’s why we have problems today of ecology. We have problems of AIDS, drugs, all other extreme things. We have no balance. Machines we make, they are for us. We are not for machines. We’ve discovered Science for us, not for Science. We are masters. Why should there be problem then within us and without? Also we find we are not integrated. There’s a very little problem that is we do not know the Absolute. And the Absolute is the Truth for everyone. You become part and parcel of the whole. The microcosm becomes the macrocosm, like this hand feels the pain and another just comes to soothe it automatically, spontaneously. This hand doesn’t give pain to this hand. It doesn’t want to hurt it. This transformation has to take place among human beings, then all barriers will drop and dissolve. And we’ll realize that we are created by one creator. And the whole world is one. But just by having foundations of peace, foundation of cooperation is all mental. It’s not going to help us. This transformation has to take within ourselves to solve our problems. But as a result of this happening you are empowered that you can give realization to others and transform others. You are empowered that you can cure others and you can give comfort to others. You are empowered that you can counsel others about reality.

Above all you become peace yourself. You feel your peace and wherever you go you emit peace and bliss. You become Joy. And wherever you go you emit Joy. Joy which has no duality of Unhappiness and Happiness. It seems fantastic. But human beings are fantastic. They don’t know their glory. They are not aware of it. Say for example, this instrument is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. People are trying to find their meanings, first get connected to the whole. One has to be connected to this all-pervading power which is a subtle power which does all living things. We see the flowers and we see that the trees have different fruits. Who does the choices? And who makes all that? Just look at our eyes itself are the best cameras that you could think of. We are already programmed to be a computer. We don’t think, it just works. But now you have to become the Divine computer. Unless and until that happens we’ll have all the problems and more problems and more problems.

So, we have to be that powerful personality, that compassionate personality, that dynamic personality.

Aside for Patrick: And powerful.

And you should know all about your powers too. All this is absolutely easy. We have lots of time. We have watches on to save the time but where do we waste then. If we could spend some time on ourselves, then we don’t even need a watch, it works. And then you enter into the kingdom of God which is miraculous. And miracles of every kind you see and you’re amazed. So many here are Sahaj yogis, all over the world. It is working now in 30 nations, and they all can tell you so many miracles.

In India, we have the University of Delhi which has recognized Sahaj Yoga for the course of MD and three doctors have submitted their thesis for it and have got it through. For doctors. And they have done subjects like physical fitness, and psychosomatic diseases like cancer and thirdly epilepsy.

Aside for Patrick: Psychosomatic. Physical Abilities. Physical fitness.

So it is for us to know about oneself and to enjoy ourselves and others. It is not frivolous. And it is not serious. It is mirth and joy.

Patrick is unable to explain mirth. Laughter.

Mirth is a fun. No word in French. I’m sorry. So now we’ll have to introduce a new word in French.

When I first came on my program I had one Sahaj Yogini in London. When I first came she told me, that Mother you should not smile at all because French think that life is all misery. And that that if you if you don’t feel sorry then they’ll think you are ignoramus. You don’t know anything about the world.

No no no. That I am an ignoramus, if I am not miserable.

I’d read a novel of Victor Hugo, Les Miserables, and I started with them with that. So that’s not so! The creator who has created this creation, will never allow it to be destroyed. He has created you also so beautifully, so carefully. And everything is laid down within you. Whatever may be the past, please forget it. And the future doesn’t exist. In the present, you all are going to get your self-realization. May God bless you all!

31.09

Aside: Should I ask them to ask questions? Such that it prolongs a lot. What do you say?Eh?

Alright if you want to ask me any questions please do. But by asking questions and knowing the answer the Kundalini doesn’t rise. I’m telling you the Truth. If you have any questions you can ask me.

(inaudible) No question. There’s one gentleman there.

32.27

Question: He is saying do you think, Mother, the technique of ‘Japa’ very good for self-realization?

SMJ: No, my child, no. See, the ‘japa’ is they give you some name or something to recite. Now, it’s like a car. If it is ignited, if it is ignited and when it starts moving, you know where is the obstruction.

Supposing, I am in London. And I have to come to Paris. Now on the way I have not moved out at all. Sitting in London if I say open the door of Paris, what’s the use? Like the Kundalini has to rise and passes through six centres, and any centre which is closed - that you can find out, we can find out, they can find out. Then we’ll have to of course say something which I will show you just now during meditation, just now, while your Kundalini is rising, but the Kundalini must start.

Moreover, supposing I want to meet Mr. Mitterand. Now for meeting him supposing I go to his door and start shouting Mitterand, Mitterand, Mitterand! The police will arrest me. I must take permission. I must have the protocol. I should be allowed to go inside otherwise it is not proper.

In the same way, if you say, if you take the name of any of the deities, without Kundalini awakening, without proper protocol, the doors are closed. Not only that, but these chakras get spoilt. You get arrested. If it is with the President, I am talking about God Almighty, who is the President of all the Presidents. So how can you do it? This is unauthorized.

Alright?

36.55

Question: Is it possible to be connected with the Divine without Kundalini awakening?

SMJ: No. You cannot create a tree without sprouting the seed. That’s what Christ has said. Know thyself. Without the Kundalini you cannot know yourself. This is described as the Tree of Life.

38.12

Question: Will pranayam help me?

SMJ: Pranayama is not going to help you. At all. See, it’s more physical. And, we do pranayam also in Sahaj Yoga but it is very scientific. Whenever it is necessary. Here, the people do all these, pranayama, and all these yoga things as if taking all the medicines from the medicine box without a doctor.

The best way to know is this way.

You must have seen many people who are doing Pranayama, who’s doing yoga. What do you when they run too much, what is it called? In America. They do Jogging. Oh! They all run like mad. Everybody runs. Everybody is running as if there is an earthquake, whether it is old young anything. Everybody’s running in America.

So anything you do, you must find out what is the transformation that has come in that person. Is there, are they sweet people? Are they peaceful? Hath Yogis are such that if they come from this door better run away from that the other, the way they are. Horrid and hot tempered. Mostly they divorce their wives, give up their children. There’s no sweetness. Hitler was a Hath Yogi. Did you know that? And a follower of Llama. Double. And a follower of Llama. Not this one. Another one.

Alright. There’s another one gentleman. Now you asked one question. What he saying? Bhatt yogi? Who is Bhatt Yogi? I don’t know. What do you think? Is the point. There are all kinds of bhatt, satt, katt, but how am I to know all of them. Only thing I can say that you just see yourself. You can know yourself. You must know that Indians can be very cunning people. I am sorry to say. Because we have had 300 years the company of the English. Anything for which you have to pay is all falsehood. That’s as simple. Very simple.

You people are very vulnerable because you are seekers. So be careful, don’t get lost.

43.19

Question: How do we protect ourselves from negative vibrations?

SMJ: That we’ll tell you everything. We’ll be having a course. You’ll be expert and no negative forces will come near you. They’ll all run away. One day they’ll run away from Paris and then from the whole of France.

Let’s have it now. Is there one more lady. There.

44.32

Question: (Inaudible) how do we give (get) respect to others, because others do not understand us.

SMJ: They will understand. Everybody understands love.

Alright. He’s a seeker. Alright alright, ask the question. He is a seeker, he has the right.

Question: What do you think of this Krishna movement?

SMJ: I mean you yourself judge. In India, when we get up, we take the Rama’s name. When we say somebody as good morning, we say Ram. Good evening, Ram. What have we achieved?

Krishna is supposed to be Kubera, is the lord of Wealth. And his disciples are begging on the streets. How can that be?

What’s he say, this gent? What’s he say?

Question: Someone who has no knowledge of / about the Kundalini, can he raise his Kundalini?

SMJ: Of course. That’s much better. That’s much better. Much better. That’s innocence. Those who know about it are mostly very crooked people. They misuse it. They frighten people. Actually, there’s nothing to be known about Kundalini. But you see, you know French people you cannot just ask them to take their realization. You have to tell them something about it after all. Like when you come in this room, if you have to put the lights, you just switch on one light. You don’t have to tell what is the history? How it came in? What is the source? See. But if it’s a Frenchman, you may have to tell a little bit.

Alright!

50.14

There are two conditions. One condition is that we are not to feel guilty at all. Forget the past. Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Because both things are myths. Whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. So don’t say it is difficult; it’s the easiest thing to say I forgive everything. Once you forgive, the Divine takes over. So you have to have these two conditions fulfilled.

If you want to have self-realisation, you all have to help to raise your Kundalini as I’ll tell you. But if you don’t want to have, I cannot force you. It’s in your freedom and your glory you have to get it. So all such people if you don’t want, they can leave the hall. You cannot force.

We have to take the help of the mother earth so if you don’t mind you have to take out your shoes. And you have to sit comfortably with both the legs, both the feet apart from each other. Tomorrow, I’ll tell you more about the left and right channels and the two energies but today remember that left and right are two energies within us.

So we put our left hand like this towards me and the right hand we have to use for the action.

Aside: You come. Come. I’ll stand up I think. Can you put it (mic) up?

First I will show you then we’ll have to close the eyes. First I will show you, then they will have to close the eyes. You have to put your left hand towards me like this.

Aside: I think most of them have got realization in the music only.

And the right hand we have to use for giving energy to our centres on the left hand side. So we put our left hand towards me like this symbolizing our desire to get realization.

So right hand we put it on our heart. In the heart resides the spirit, which is the reflection of God Almighty, the creator, in our heart. Then we take down our right hand the upper part of the abdomen. This is the centre of our mastery. All the prophets and great masters have built this for us. Then we take down our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of pure knowledge. The pure knowledge that manifests through our central nervous system. Beyond mental projections. Then we take our right hand in the upper part of our abdomen on the left hand side again,        then on to our heart. Then we take our right hand in the corner of our shoulder and our neck, and we turn our head to our right.

Aside for Patrick: I think you also do it otherwise everybody’s watching you.

Now, so, this is the centre we catch when we feel guilty. Now, we take this hand on our forehead across like this across and press it on both the sides. We bend our head as, while we are pressing. This is the centre for forgiveness. Then we take our hand on the back side of our head and slowly move our head upward like this, allow it to rest. This is the centre where we have to ask for forgiveness without feeling guilty. Now we spread our hand, stretch it and put the centre of our palm on top of our fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in our childhood.

We bend our head and push back our fingers and press our skull hard and move it slowly seven times clockwise. That’s all we’ll have to do.

Only thing remember don’t put hand from this side. Put this way (indicating correct position for Vishuddhi) and stretch your fingers quite a lot to bring pressure.

Put it this way, from the front. Now we’ll close our eyes. You can take out your spectacles if you like. And we don’t open our eyes till I tell you.

1:00:17

Alright. So now, please put your right hand on your heart. Left hand towards me. Both the feet away from each other. And now. Here you have to ask me a very important question. ‘Mother, am I the spirit?’ Ask this question three times.

Now, if you are the spirit, you are your master, you are your guide. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and please ask another question. You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother, whichever suits you. Please ask the question: ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ Ask this question three times. I’ve already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to know it in your own freedom. I respect your freedom. So please take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, and press it hard. Here, please say, ‘Mother, give me pure knowledge’. I cannot force on you. Say it six times because this centre has got six petals or six sub-plexuses. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge your Kundalini starts moving upwards so we have to support the centres with our full confidence in the higher regions.

So please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here with full confidence you have to say ten times, ‘Mother, I am my own Master’. Say it ten times please. Say it ten times.

Now we have to know that we are not this body, we are not this mind, we are not this intellect. We are not this these emotions, nor we are our conditionings, nor our ego. We are pure spirit. So please raise your right hand to your heart and say it with full confidence twelve times, Mother, I am the spirit!

I have already told you that we should not feel guilty at all. We have to know that Divine is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of Joy and Bliss. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes we commit, are dissolved into this great ocean of forgiveness. So please put your left hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. Here, you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, sixteen times, ‘Mother, I am not guilty at all’. Say it with full confidence.

Now as I have already told you that whether we forgive or don’t forgive, it is a myth. But if we don’t forgive we play into wrong hands. And the Divine also says also that you better look after yourself. So now leave it to the Divine. Raise your right hand on your forehead and put the forehead slowly bending down. Now press it hard. Here you have to say, ‘Mother, I forgive everyone’. Please do it. Because of this I have seen many people just don’t get realization. Say it from your heart, not how many times.

Now, take back your right hand on the backside of your head and put the head on it slowly, move it upward. Here now you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, from your heart: ‘O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me’. Now, say it from your heart.

Stretch your hand fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. This is very important because it is the actualization of baptism. Now, just push out your fingers and press your scalp hard and move it seven times. But here again, I cannot take your freedom. So you have to say seven times, ‘Mother, please give me my realization’. I cannot force on you. I respect your freedom.

Push back your fingers. It’s quite in front. Not on the backside. Front side.

Now please take down your hand. Have they been moving it’s alright.

Now see for yourself. Open your eyes slowly. Open your eyes slowly.

Now put your right hand towards me and bend your head and see from your left hand if you are feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Cool or hot.

Now please put your left hand and see with the right hand. Bend your head.

Now see with the right hand. Again.

Bend your head. Bending down, it’s better.

Now raise your heads up like this and ask a question, three times, ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God’s love? Mother, is this the brahma chaitanya?’ Ask one of these three times. Ask one of these questions three times.

All those, please take down your hands. Now watch me without thinking, you can do it. Now those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head or in their hands, or even the heat, please raise both your hands.

O my God! See the France! May God bless you all! So many of you. So be in silence now. Don’t argue. Tomorrow I’m coming again. If you all come early then we can start the programme at right time. And I would like to meet you all personally. Tomorrow. May God bless you all!

Aside: so many of them have felt it. No one wants to leave. (inaudible) pick up some record or something. They’re still here. Waiting for me to go. Some record you can put. Anything. Any instrumental so that... (inaudible). Tomorrow. Tomorrow I’ll be there. I’m saying end it up... Have you got something? You didn’t bring any tapes with you? Music tapes. Then put on something.

Patrick, also tell them those who did not get realization should not feel disappointed. Tomorrow, all of them will get it.
