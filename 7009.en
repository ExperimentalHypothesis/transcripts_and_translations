Two Talks to yogis. Ganapatipule (India), 26 December 1988.

First Talk
Today we all Sahaja yogis are standing on the brink of the ocean, ocean of humanity, where we have to face the problems of human beings. Otherwise, in the nature there are no problems. They are all already solved. So one has to understand that it’s not just the movement of few people, chosen people, just to achieve Self-realization, but it’s a big revolution which has to bring forth the beauties of human beings, the glories of human beings, the proof of Divinity, of Divine Power and of God Almighty. We have to now face that multitude of people who are absolutely ignorant compared to you, who have not known the knowledge of God, who are either lost into the darkness of ignorance or are burning in the fire of ego. We have to transform this world into a new world, a beautiful world which you all are enjoying, to establish it, to be established on this earth, for which we have to prepare ourselves.

So far Sahaja Yoga means blessings. If somebody is blessed, blessed they ask Me questions, “How is it, Mother, we haven’t got this when we are praying to you? Why did it not work out? It should have happened. After all, we are worshiping You. So how is it that my son did not get the job?” So I mean as if is sort of a, some debts have to be paid to all the Sahaja yogis by Sahaja Yoga. That sort of an attitude has been so far towards Sahaja Yoga, of not all of you, I must say, but in the minds there’s lurking always a desire to know why, when we are Sahaja yogis, why should it happen to us. You’ve seen that God has blessed you. Some people had very miserable married life. They couldn’t understand why they had to have a miserable married life. Some had some misfortunes and some had some diseases also after coming to Sahaja Yoga. So there has to be understanding that Sahaja Yoga is for correcting your life, for putting you on solid basis, on proper foundations, to make you great people as if it gets you immuned. So all these mishappenings means blessings, of course. So you don’t feel the effects of those misfortunes so much as you would normally feel.

Thus creates beautiful human beings out of you. Some people have hankering after money. Some people think they can make money by coming to Sahaja Yoga. Some people think they will become leaders or something, they will have fame, something that they will achieve a kind of a very dominant position, and some think that they can befool Me also. At right time we’ll realize that Sahaja Yoga is not for this. Sahaja Yoga is for making you the wisest person, the sanest person, the most generous and the most confident person in the world, because you have to fight. You have to fight the dark ignorance of Kali Yuga, of ages which is precipitated, and today we see all the bad effects of it. Whatever you may call it, you may call it the fanaticism, you may call it the atheism, any “isms” of any kinds, and all these human projections which have created all those artificial webs have to be broken. But human beings on the whole believe that these artificial webs are real. So to break that, you have to be, also be careful that you don’t break the human beings. While you are breaking their false faiths you have to remember that those people who are carrying those false faiths are the ones who have to achieve Self-realization. It’s a very delicate work, it’s a very hard work, it’s a very harsh work but it is the most detached work.

And when we realize that we are so important, that God has blessed us with this peace, with this understanding, with these powers, it’s not only for our own gain because God is not only for you; He is for the whole world. So we have to utilize them, we have to spread them, work it out at every level. We have to become dynamic about it. But the most important thing is the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga we have to take. We are Sahaja yogis and we are responsible for Sahaja Yoga. What have you done for Sahaja Yoga? We looked after our family, our children, our jobs, our this, our that, motorcars, our horses, our dogs, our cats. But who is responsible for Sahaja Yoga? When it comes to that point we are responsible Sahaja Yoga. Then it works out, and works out in a very [unclear].

[Aside referring to some noise: What’s the matter? What’s that?]

Sahaja Yogi: Indian [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Ah. All right, doesn’t matter. Outside?

Sahaja Yogi: It’s the [unclear].

Shri Mataji: That’s the disturbance only. But there is a deliberate action also of the negative forces, and this negativity is acting through ignorant people who believe, who believe that they are right. They don’t know what is waiting for their destruction there. Specially among our young people, you will find they just join any party, join any club, join any methods, any trend, anything, just because they have no understanding as to what they have to be. They have to be the Spirit.

I asked the other day a president of a young organization, “What is your policy?” They said, “We have no policy.” They started looking here and there, said, “We have no policy.” I was amazed that they have no policy. “No, whatever our leaders say, we do it.” So to get people out of this kind of slavery, that they have no brains of their own, they can’t use their own understanding, they have to become the Spirit. Shivaji, who was a great atma shakshatkar, [real, a] realized soul, for the future he has given the message. He said, “Swa sharma dhaga baba,” means, “Enlighten your dharma of Spirit.” Swa dharma, the Spirit, has to be enlightened. Everybody has said that. I’m specially quoting him because he comes from Maharashtra. Apart from that he was a political head. Though he was a political head but because he was a realized soul he said that your Spirit should be awakened. He didn’t talk of all other nonsensical things, and he knew that unless and until the Spirit is awakened, people will be doing all kinds of wrong things. And that is why today we find all over the world the mess in which all political parties, all economic endeavors, all military endeavors have fallen into.

So it is for us to take over and to show them what is an integrated life and what is the strength of a human being, because this shakti is within everyone. Just praying to shakti, just talking about shakti, it doesn’t act. But this divine shakti has to act, and act through you people. Just try to realize that within these few years how much knowledge you have got, how much you know, how deeply you know. You are not just passing slogans or talking, you know, but you know it; you know what it is.  I don’t think I have attended to each one of you individually, but through your Spirit only you have come to know all the knowledge about yourself and all the knowledge about others. You didn’t have to go to any library. You didn’t have to go to any university. All the saints never went. None of the saints went to any university or read any books, but how knowledgeable they were because they were the Spirit. So the first and foremost responsibility of a Sahaja yogi on this day is to be the Spirit, on the day when we are celebrating the birthday of Christ, who was the Spirit.

So this is our greatest responsibility, first to see that are we the Spirit, or we are this body, this mind, this ego. What are we? If you have achieved that state, if you have achieved that state, then you are, as they call in Marathi, samartha, means you are equal to your name, that you are the Spirit. If you cannot achieve that then you are a half-baked Sahaja yogi, not yet done. As you know, we have no organizations, no memberships, nothing. But we have one thing that we know we are realized souls, that we know more than all others know and that we are not proud of it. We are very humble people. But this humility should not become a stagnation or a lethargy within us that, “Now we are realized soul. Let us sit on a tree and have our blessings.” We have to get to the roots and you all have to work it out on your level. But first get rid of your own personal problems, all petty things that you have.

When we talk of sacrifice, as you know, in Sahaja Yoga I have not known what sacrifice people have done. You have to sacrifice your ego, which is the headache to you and to Me, and you have to sacrifice your conditioning ? only two things, left and right.  And that can be achieved, and many have achieved. But now put that detached personality to a test, and then once you are sure that you are detached then employ your energy in doing constructive improvement of this whole world. It will work out for poverty, it will work out for politics, it will work out for economics, it will work out for every field of life. Sahaja Yoga is the only solution because in this, human beings are transformed. It’s not like this, that one person changes the address or the badge that he is wearing and he becomes something else, or from church to temple and temple to church. It’s something within that transforms you, makes you knowledgeable. So you are already sat chit anand because you know the truth, you are in joy and your attention is enlightened.

With all [these, this] that you have, what are we to do now? If you enlighten the light it automatically knows that it has to give the light. In the same way, all the Sahaja yogis have to take the responsibility for this great war we have started. It’s not the war with source or with atomic energies, because they are all destructive. This is the war against all the destructive powers through the power of love, which is constructive, which constructs human beings, which constructs societies, which constructs countries, then the whole world. That is your own, and also this decision has to be your own. Even if I give big lectures and say things it may not have any effects whatsoever on you. It might be just wasted, if you haven’t got the capacity to imbibe what I am saying ? so important, so imminent.

Now give up all the worries you have about your small, small, little, little things of your family, of your work, your factories, of your business, of your official positions, and just know that everything has to go through Sahaja Yoga. Even the cooking I do, I do it through Sahaj.  If the fire is not working, just put your hands to fire; it becomes all right. If the rice is not cooking, put your hands to the rice; it cooks. Anything going wrong anywhere, you can use your vibrations. But I don’t know what to use to make you feel responsible for Sahaja Yoga that now we’ve got such a great thing with us and what are we going to do about it. [Hindi/Marathi] to/do what I am saying. May God bless you all.
Second Talk
We have to understand that we have risen above our human awareness and at that level we were different and at this new awareness we are different people and all our priorities must change. Our value system has to change, and if it has not changed automatically we have to little bit deliberately work it out. Or else we have to see that we become really the Spirit and no more of all the falsehood of human awareness should be attached to us or we should be bothered about it.

The, if you see, the principle of everything, as I see, the principle of everything, rather human endeavor, whatever it is, it is based on gathering property. Whether it is communism, or it is democracy or socialism or anything, it’s all going round and round to the point of property. Property, that may be land, that may be money, that may be anything. All economic activity surrounds that one point, is property. So the democracy, though it’s a political organization or political theory, actually is based on something very economic, economical thing called property. Then, same about communism, we can say; it’s the same thing, to, how to distribute the property, how to have the property equally, how to make everybody self-sufficient. But as soon as you become a realized soul, you have to know that your properties and your priorities are very different. Your property is your Spirit and your priorities are where you can manifest your Spirit and can feel the Spirit of others. So the whole concept that was so far obstructing you and limiting your understanding changes into an unlimited area where you start thinking of the Spirit.

Now in that concept of the Spirit, the property of the Spirit is twofold. One in its nature, the nature of the Spirit is, as we call it, sat chit ananada, means it is the joy. Then it’s the truth. It tells you the truth all the times. It gives you discretion, divine discretion, and chit, the attention that acts, that works, that gives you all the information. So you have got the nature of the Spirit thus felt within yourself. But on the other side, what does it want or what are its duties or why to be the Spirit is? Such questions arise later on when we are about to enter into the Kingdom of God. Why to enter into the Kingdom of God? So in outside and, we can say, all the manifestations of the Spirit is, that it is benevolent. It is hita cari. It gives benevolence to others. It gives you benevolence and it gives benevolence to others, also. The only joy in that is benevolence. And you think of all these material things, which are so important otherwise, as if they are for giving it to someone just to express your love. So the benevolence that comes through love, benevolence doesn’t come through oppression or suppression or by intimidation but it comes only through love, and if you have faith in your love you can work it out.

Sometimes it seems, many people have asked Me, “Mother, why so many saints have suffered and they had to undergo so much of torture?” Actually they never get tortured. They just played the game.  They just want to see how far the stupid people can go. Like Christ stood on the donkeys to show that, that the donkeys are to be ridden. But He can never be dominated. He can never be crucified. In the same way a saint, if he bears something, he does not in any way suffers.

But now the time has come for you to enjoy Sahaja Yoga. You have so many friends, you have so many relations, you have the complete group, such a big group, which may, can be called as a religion, which is with you. So you don’t suffer at all; you just enjoy all the time. But the second part of it, that what benevolence we have done to others, is very important. If that is not achieved, if that we have not established, then we cannot go very higher. So the other part of the benevolence is that what have we done for others. Have we raised their Kundalini? Have we given them realization? But there are lots of temptations because we are coming from the human level, lots of temptations that we start dominating others, we start becoming like Pharisees, we start regularizing. Then this leadership business also comes in and some people become leaders and some start complaining.

Just the other day I’ve explained to you, especially for Australians, I told them what had happened. So one has to realize that it is complete freedom. There’s no question of anybody dominating you or suppressing you. You, it’s only in your freedom that you allow others to suppress. Because there are laws, you can always correct the people who are suppressing you, who are troubling you, torturing you.  But you do not do it, because you are absolutely free; you don’t bother. But the doing the benevolence to others when people start thinking that we are leaders or we are something high-ranking people in Sahaja Yoga, they should know first of all that there’s nothing like that. You are one part and parcel of one body and there’s nothing like higher and lower. Everybody has his own role to play, everybody has his own style to work out, but it has to be for the benevolence of the whole and not of an individual. Once you realize that, such a person becomes extremely humble, extremely conducive and he can articulate in a very beautiful manner with other people and you never feel that he is your boss but you feel he is your father. He’s looking after you with love and affection, but in that love there’s no expectation at all, except that of giving. And this giving is the most beautiful thing Sahaja yogis can do.

For example, now I must thank all the Sahaja yogis from abroad who have brought beautiful presents for the Indian Sahaja yogis here. So give them a hand. Most of the things I have selected and suggested, [I] agree, but a day will come when you will be able to do it, everything, yourself. You will know what these people need, what should be brought and what should be done. [Hindi/Marathi] This [unclear] this country is very respectable. Different concepts. So, I mean, you are foreign guests, you see. We call them foreign guests. [Aside: Hindi/Marathi]

You all have been very kind to Me, but I am very happy that you have been so kind to My husband and My family as well and you have appreciated the way they have been supporting Me in Sahaja Yoga. I did say that the bureaucrats are the ones who always go to wrong gurus because their attention is different. They don’t want to have Self-realization. They don’t want to have something subtler but say they are worried about their jobs and things like that. So naturally they go to wrong gurus and try to get into troubles. And invariably I have seen most of the bureaucrats have been to all kinds of funny gurus and they have come to Me and said that, “We’ve got cancer. We’ve got this. We’ve got this trouble.” But I didn’t mean that they will go to hell, but I did say it’s rather difficult for them to enter into the Kingdom of God, because they believe in another kingdom. They do not believe in the Kingdom of God. But I must say I have lived like a bureaucrat’s wife also, and I have also seen what sort of people they are. Whatever it is they get very much touched by your love.

Throughout in our lives I’ve been taking very active part in his official things, in the sense that I would prepare breakfast for his union leaders who came from Calcutta or I would go to his ships and get them decorated and I would speak to all the people in the office. I mean, it was quite an intimate relationships. And everybody now even says that “Whenever we travel they want to know about You. They want to ask about You.” Even in the United Nations when he is working as Secretary-General there with the IMO, I think the people somehow or other look forward to something that is love and that is serene. Very surprising it is that people understand these things even when they are so much in the gross. But now the whole cosmos is working it out for us. I think the attention which goes to these things always helps. The whole cosmos is working it out. We have so many hopes now before us.

As far as Grégoire is concerned and Rajesh is concerned ? these people first came to Sahaja Yoga – they were very brilliant, intelligent people. Of course, it took some time for Me to put them right. But once they saw the point of Sahaja Yoga they were first concerned, because they are very socialistic people, concerned about other people. Grégoire would bother Me so much about everybody else: “Mother, what’s going to happen to them? What’s going to happen to this side? What is going to?” So I just told him that, “Don’t worry about all of them. There’s not much place in God’s kingdom. So you don’t worry. First of all, you establish yourself. You just don’t worry about these people that they should be all right, they should be transformed.” “Why don’t you do it this way?” Also they thought I was a little shy of publicity and things like that. I said, “I will do the way it has to be done. The living process has to work out slowly.” And gradually it started working out properly. We got the right type of people who grew up in the most matured manner and they are mature today. And they can now work it out.

So now, what about the Kingdom of God? We have to bring the Kingdom of God on this Earth. But to manifest it, it’s important that all the Sahaja yogis have to be honestly Sahaja yogis.

Now regarding Mr. Shrivastava, I have to say one thing that he’s an extremely honest man. He’s so honest that if he finds Me doing something wrong he’ll put Me to the jail. And his sense of honesty really beats Me. But there’s one thing good about the honesty part of it. Even if people are honest and they know what is right, they may not do it, they may not accept it, and they may not use it as a lifestyle. But his is the case where honesty is his lifestyle. For him honesty and discipline is lifestyle. So now once he has accepted Sahaja Yoga as something honestly, as he told Me, “I cannot be dishonest anymore about Sahaja Yoga. I see people being transformed. I can see it. So how can I be dishonest about it?”

So now, once this happens then all such people – I always used to say there is some kink in dishonest people in the government, and they are the ones who are so honest compared to all others that sometimes it used to surprise Me? but now this honesty is going to play the part with the bureaucrats, with the people who are in higher positions, who are at the helm of affairs. It’s going to work out, this honesty. And this honesty, if they want to make it into a lifestyle, they all have to go or dissolve into the ocean of Sahaj. There’s no way out. Because if you believe this is the honest thing and the truth and if you are honest, it’s just like you put the diamond in the proper platinum. It’s, cannot be anything else.

That’s why I have great hopes now, like Gorbachev has come. He’s a very honest man. He believes in his honesty of his faith and everything. Like that, we have many other people also who are coming out, and you’ll be surprised one day will come, in their honesty they will understand that peace is important and secondly, transformation of human beings.  And that point, if it breaks through, then Sahaja Yoga is there. As you know that Sahaja Yoga is not meant for few or for very few individuals. It is collective. But it is made for the whole of the collective and it has to work out that way. But as you know, I have never contradicted Myself, but gradually I have opened you all to the truth because I didn’t want to blast you. But it is now, you can see the future of this world so beautiful, and I am sure in our life’s time we’ll see that beautiful time coming in. May God bless you all.
