Talk To The French Sahaja Yogis, Bordi, 1984

Shri Mataji: Only for the French. Only for the French, only the French. Now, I’ve told about the French you see. The problem with the French is that they are very individualistic. Can you translate?
Sahaja Yogi: Yeas.
Shri Mataji: And they can’t bear leadership. In your country you know how many times you changed your President. That your President, Tito [?], had to say and said that: "if you keep me for 5 years, I’ll stay rather than not stay." That’s French mind. Because everybody thinks they are very clever and very intelligent. And they know how to [inaudible] others, they always see the defects of another person.

Now first we had Marie as our leader there. All the French were against her. She’s the one who arrange- [Hindi]
No, it is only for French. All of you who are not French should go that side a little bit.
Tell him. All of you should go.
Stop the music please.

Now, the basic problem that lies with every country we must fight. Now the thing is, when we had Marie as a leader, every body was at her throat. They could not see a single good point in her. [Hindi]
Now, as a result of that, I asked them: "Can you replace her?" She was intelligent, educated, generous. Only thing she was not so dignified, perhaps. But now, how can you get a perfect person?
So we dislodged her nicely. We dislodged her. Then came Alexander. It seems you are all after his life now. If you go on behaving like this, Sahaja Yoga can never be established anywhere. Now he has married an Indian girl, and I know what he is doing. In case I find anything wrong with him, I’ll put him right. But you just don’t try to correct him and don’t try to find faults, otherwise you’ll again make the whole organisation extremely weak.
May be, somebody, Robert, is good in this, maybe he, Patrick, is good in that, every thing. But now, for Me to communicate to all of you is impossible. In the body, there is only one heart. How many hearts there are?
Now, if I have to cater to all the parts of the body, it’s difficult. So now, let him be there, in one piece. [Shri Mataji laughs] and be kind. It is not good to fight like this, find faults with him.
Actually, Indians have noticed this. They have noticed that French are not collective. They told Me and they like him very much. Indians never think, if I say: "All right, he’ the leader, all right." Then they will never question second time, you see? See how they work? Can you see them anywhere? What a food they gave you today? The whole, see the whole arrangements. Actually, you people did not do any work, they have been doing all the work!
Because you people go on criticizing each other, you have no energy to do any work. Ad quite a lot of ego.
Like Jean-François, three girls he refused to marry.
[Shri Mataji laughs]
And for your information, [Trish??], she doesn’t want to marry. I must tell you about that one.
[Laughter]
She doesn’t want to marry.
Sahaja Yogi: And Daniele.
Shri Mataji: Daniela, I know but she doesn’t want to marry, the one you want to marry.
Sahaja Yogi: I know Mother.
Shri Mataji: So what! You see what I’m saying? All right. So what I am trying to tell you, that you must see the reality - [Hindi]

Now, this is what it is. Now, you see, people, do you know that this Dave came all the way from America. We had no mind of marring him to somebody suddenly, because he came so late there. But Maduri who is just here and her mother is here, nobody else, she has a huge traditional family and most of them are Sahaja Yogis. And despite all that, you see, she just said: "All right, Mother, if you say, I’ll marry." She had not even seen the boy. And just see how nice they look both of them together. You can see them sitting there, what friends hey have become.
But I think French will end up as bachelors, and the ladies as spinsters. [Shri Mataji laughs]
With their big ego, Humpty Dumpty.
Hello, this is only for French.
Sahaja Yogini [Marie-Laure]: I am French Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no.
[Laughter]
No, no, no, no. You are Swiss.
Oh I see now, that’s a good idea. She is French all right.

So now, this is the position one should know that one should not try to find faults at least, if [unsure] you can, but not with the leader who is there. If you, you see, want to make fun of anyone, you can make fun of Me also. You see, French are specialists in making fun of the whole world. But what about them, are they not funny themselves?
So, one should understand that there are so many things so much funny in French. When you come to India, you will realize it. Ad the girls who are going to have a- there are three girls who are going to France and there are in for shocks.
[Shri Mataji laughs]
Yes of course, can’t you [inaudible]? It’s a very different country, I must tell them. They’re in for shocks. [Hindi]
You are all in for shocks. [Hindi]
The whole system is different; their whole ideology is different; the priorities are different; these are really different people. But most of them are really upside down people. That’s a fact, you know. 

So, now, the Sahaja Yoga is settling down. I used to always say that France is the "Narka" ["Narka Loka" means Hell], you remember, and that you people have become the lotuses and you have to emit fragrance. So try to understand your responsibility, you have to be serious people, not making fun of each other. And you must respect each other. The idea that, if you become frivolous and childish, then you become young and flagrant [unsure] and all, that is nonsense, you’ll see that; dignity is so important. 
Now for us as Sahaja Yogis in France, we have to inculcate tremendous dignity for ourselves and for others. And I would say, also Alexander, you should also now know that you are a grown up person, all of you should know that you are grown up people. Don’t be frivolous, don’t be cheapish; don’t be childish. All of you should feel that and that is what I expect of all the Sahaja Yogis. Now, luckily, you have three girls from India.  They don’t think too much and they don’t go on like that, you see? 
Ah! You see what I see is this, that when you start talking like that, loosely, you always hurt each other, I mean they are experts in hurting each other, nobody minds it also. It’s so shameless. 

We are not only Human beings, we are Realized souls; we are saints of very high calibre, 
No, no, no, no, this is for French. 
Sahaja Yogi: I’m also French. 
Shri Mataji: You are a French. No, no, no, no, you can’t seat here. It’s secrets we give out. 

Now, so for you people, it is very important to understand that you all should develop a character which is a Yogi’s character. You must meditate, like them, in London, people in that hall, get up at four o’clock, have their bath and meditate. They sleep early, but French can’t sleep early. In the night all the mischiefs start. [About the translator] Already burning. 
[Shri Mataji laughs] 
All the night, all the mischiefs of the left side start. So best is to get up in the morning and have your bath because now you have to know, you are the working forests of those trees which can give any boon to anyone- Kalpatarus [wishing trees]. And you are the oceans of nectars which talk. That’s what was described about. And can you lack behind? [To the translator]  How can you lack behind, how can you remain behind?
Shri Mataji: You translate better? 
[Change of the translator]
So, it is important that all the French Sahaja Yogis must know where they are and how much efforts is needed to transform that atmosphere. A special effort, a double effort is needed by French than anybody else. So, one has to work it out in that way that we change the Hell into Heaven. So, all of us to be together, don’t try to find faults which each other. And I’m sure a day will come when France will rise very high in spirituality. I am very hopeful. And the number of times I’ve gone to Paris, I’ve not been to any place so far. But the difference is this that now, the boat has started moving, but the Sahaja Yogis have to become experts. 

I mean you should take responsibility then you’ll think that, supposing we are criticizing say, Patrick, then we are criticizing our own hand. All right? Now so I request you that when I come next to France, this time again I’m going to come, we are going to have very goods programs and you all put together, who have lived together now, are going to give such a nice picture of brotherhood, of each other’s love and  affection and respect. Because it will spread out, but it won’t have the depth. You can go deep down, holding the whole sari down with you.
