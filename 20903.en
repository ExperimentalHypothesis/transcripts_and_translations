b'Talk To The French Sahaja Yogis, Bordi, 1984\n\nEnd of seminar after weddings; each group of countries was taken apart\n\nShri Mataji: Only for the French. Only for the French, only the French. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told about the French you see. The problem with the French is that they are very individualistic. Can you translate?\nSahaja Yogi: Yes.\nShri Mataji: And they can\xe2\x80\x99t bear leadership. In your country, you know how many times you changed your President. That your President, Tito [President of old Yugoslavia], had to say and say that: "if you keep me for 5 years I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay, otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99ll not stay." That\xe2\x80\x99s French mind.\nBecause everybody thinks they are very clever and very intelligent. And they know how to outwit others, they always see the defects of another person.\nNow first we had Marie as our leader there. All the French were against her. She\xe2\x80\x99s the one who arrange- [Hindi] No, it is only for French.\nAll of you who are not French should go that side a little bit.\nTell him. All of you should go.\nStop the music please.\n\nNow, the basic problem that lies with every country we must fight. Now the thing is, when we had Marie as the leader, every body was at her throat. They could not see a single good point in her. [Hindi]\nNow, as a result of that, I asked that: "Can you replace her?" She was intelligent, educated, generous. Only thing she was not so dignified, perhaps. But now, how can you get a perfect person?\nSo we dislodged her nicely. We dislodged her. Then came Alexander. And it seems you are all after his life now. If you go on behaving like this, Sahaja Yoga can never be established anywhere. Now he has married an Indian girl, and I know what he is doing. In case I find anything wrong with him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put him right. But you just don\xe2\x80\x99t try to correct him and don\xe2\x80\x99t try to find faults; otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99ll again make the whole organisation extremely weak.\nMaybe, somebody, Robert, is good in this, maybe he, Patrick, is good in that, every thing. But now, for Me to communicate to all of you is impossible. In the body, there is only one heart. How many hearts there are?\nNow, if I have to cater to all the parts of the body, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. So now, let him be there in one piece, [Shri Mataji laughs] and be kind. It is not good to fight like this, find faults with him.\nActually, Indians have noticed this. They have noticed it that the French are not collective. They told Me and they like him very much. Indians never think! If I say: "All right, he\xe2\x80\x99 the leader, all right." Then they will never question second time, you see? See how they work? Can you see them anywhere? What a food they gave you today? The whole, see the whole arrangements. Actually, you people did not do any work there; they have been doing all the work!\nBecause you people go on criticizing each other, you have no energy to do any work. And quite a lot of ego.\n\nLike Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois, three girls he refused to marry.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\nAnd for your information, Trish [unsure], she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry. I must tell you about that one.\n[Laughter]\nShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry.\nSahaja Yogi: And Danielle.\nShri Mataji: Danielle, I know. But she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry, the one you want to marry.\nSahaja Yogi [Patrice]: I know Mother.\nShri Mataji: So what! You see what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying? All right. So what I am trying to tell you, that you must see the reality.\n[Dialogue in Marathi]\n\nNow, this is what it is. Now, you see, people, do you know that this Dave came all the way from America. We had no mind of marring him to somebody suddenly, because he came so late, Dave. But Maduri who is just here and her mother is here, nobody else, she has a huge traditional family and most of them are Sahaja Yogis. And despite all that, you see, she just said: "All right, Mother, if you say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry." She had not even seen the boy. And just see how nice they look both of them together. You can see them sitting there, what friends they have become.\nBut I think French will end up as bachelors, and the ladies as spinsters. [Shri Mataji laughs]\nWith their big egos, Humpty Dumpy.\nHello, this is only for French.\nSahaja Yogini [Marie-Laure]: I am French Shri Mataji.\nShri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no, no.\n[Laughter]\nNo, no, no, no. You are Swiss.\nSahaja Yogi: She immigrates in Switzerland, because France was too strong.\nSahaja Yogini: When it is to be near you mother.\nShri Mataji: Oh I see now, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. She is French all right.\n\nSo now, this is the position one should know that one should not try to find faults at least, if wife you can, but not with the leader who is there. If you, you see, want to make fun of anyone, you can make fun of Me also. You see, that is, French are specialists in making fun of the whole world. But what about them, are they not funny themselves? [Shri Mataji laughs.]\nSo, one should understand that there are so many things so much funny in French. When you come to India, you will realize it. And the girls who are going to have a- there are three girls who are going to France and they are in for shocks.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\n\nYes of course, can\xe2\x80\x99t you sense things are? It\xe2\x80\x99s a very different country, I must tell them. They\xe2\x80\x99re in for shocks. [Hindi: Are you listening you all, did you not hear what I said?]\nYou are all in for shocks. [Hindi: you are going to get shocked by many things there]\nThe whole system is different; their whole ideology is different; the priorities are different; these are different people. But most of them are really upside down people. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, you know.\n\nSo, now, the Sahaja Yoga is settling down. I used to always say that France is the Narka [Narka Loka means Hell], you remember, and that you people have become the lotuses and you have to emit fragrance. So try to understand your responsibility, you have to be serious people, not making fun of each other. And you must respect each other. The idea that if you become frivolous and childish, then you become young and flagrant and all that is nonsense, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that; dignity is so important.\nNow for us as Sahaja Yogis in France, we have to inculcate tremendous dignity for ourselves and for others. And I would say, also Alexander, you should also now know that you are a grown up person, all of you should know that you are grown up people. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frivolous, don\xe2\x80\x99t be cheapish; don\xe2\x80\x99t be childish. All of you should feel that and that is what I expect of all the Sahaja Yogis. Now, luckily, you have three girls from India. They don\xe2\x80\x99t think too much and they don\xe2\x80\x99t go on like that, you see?\nAh! You see what I see is this, that when you start talking like that, loosely, you always hurt each other, I mean they are experts in hurting each other, nobody minds it also. It\xe2\x80\x99s so shameless.\n\nWe are not only human beings, we are Realized souls; we are saints of very high calibre.\nNo, no, no, no, this is for French.\nSahaja Yogi: I\xe2\x80\x99m also French.\nShri Mataji: You are a French? No, no, no, no, you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here. It\xe2\x80\x99s secrets we give out.\n\nNow, so for you people, it is very important to understand that you all should develop a character which is a Yogi\xe2\x80\x99s character. You must meditate, like them, in London, people in that cold, get up at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, have their baths and meditate. They sleep early, but French can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep early. In the night all the mischief starts. [About the translator] Already burning.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\nAll the night, all the mischief of the left side starts. So best is to get up in the morning and have your baths because now you have to know, you are the walking [working?] forests of those trees which can give any boon to anyone- Kalpatarus [wishing trees]. And you are the oceans of nectars which talk. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s described about. And how can you lack behind? [To the translator] How can you lack behind, how can you remain behind?\nShri Mataji: You translate better?\n[Change of the translator]\nSo, it is important that all the French Sahaja Yogis must know where they are and how much effort is needed to transform that atmosphere. A special effort, a double effort is needed by French than anybody else. So, one has to work it out in that way that we change the Hell into Heaven. So, all of us to be together, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to find faults which each other. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a day will come when France will rise very high in spirituality. I am very hopeful. And the number of times I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to Paris, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been to any place so far. But the difference is this that now, the boat has started moving, but the Sahaja Yogis have to become experts.\n\nI mean you should take responsibility then you\xe2\x80\x99ll think that, supposing we are criticizing say, Patrick, then we are criticizing our own hand. All right?\nNow so I request you that when I come, next, to France, this time again I\xe2\x80\x99m going to come, we are going to have very good programs and you all put together, who have lived together now, are going to give such a nice picture of brotherhood, of each other\xe2\x80\x99s love and affection and respect. Because it will spread out, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t have the depth. You can go deep down, holding the whole sari down with you.\n\nAnd once you go down, they will all come with you. Of course, I hope you enjoyed your programs here. Did you all enjoy?\nNow, who travelled for one trip already?\nOne trip already, who did?\nAlready who did it?\n[A Sahaja Yogi asks in French to raise the hand.]\nNow only I can see. One, two, three, four, five six, seven and eight. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What do you say about the whole trip? What happened to you and what you felt about the Indians you met?\nSahaja Yogi: I think I have a great lesson to imbibe from Indian Sahaja Yogis.\nShri Mataji: And you were happy?\nSahaja Yogi: I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy.\nShri Mataji: You feel very much changed also?\nSahaja Yogi: Yes, yes.\nShri Mataji: Good.\nAnd now, what about you Robert?\nSahaja Yogi (Robert): Indian people gave us very much and it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to support [stand it] for us, I think.\nSahaja Yogi: [translates] \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians are giving so much that it is difficult to bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d He is not used to it, you will see it actually.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\nShri Mataji [to Robert]: So your wife is going to give you also a lot. All right?\nMay God bless you for that.\nAnd now what about who else has been? Ah, what about you?\nSahaja Yogi: Jean-Marc.\nHe has discovered the purity of India.\nShri Mataji: Hum. And you are happy with your wife?\nSahaja Yogi [about Jean-Marc]: I think so yes.\n[Shri Mataji speaks to Jayshree in Marathi]\n\nNow, who else is here? Fran\xc3\xa7ois?\nSahaja Yogi: He said that: \xe2\x80\x9cI found that the Indians are very simple, very pure, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t receive them with our mind but with our heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShri Mataji: Yes, because you are a little complicated, na?\nYou like a hook you fix there, all right? Take out the yarn, put it there, again bring it another yarn. It is fixed twice to a hook outside. [Unsure]\n\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\nShri Mataji: You\xe2\x80\x99d better break that hook. It is all past now, you can do it very easily because you are now Yogis.\nNow, who else is there?\nSahaja Yogi: Martine. She hopes to meet the other Indian wives now.\nShri Mataji: [Dialogue in Hindi].\nSo what did she say?\nSahaja Yogi: She said, she will be very pleased to meet Indians who are coming to our country, she\xe2\x80\x99s very pleased.\nShri Mataji: Oh, I see. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy about it. You tell them, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t know many things which you know, you see, for example, your aesthetics are much better. I mean, after all, you understand art much better, colour\xe2\x80\x99s sense you have, lots of things there are. But they understand morality better I think.\nAnd you have a tradition of aesthetic things and all that. We too are, I mean, very creative people, no doubt, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have appreciation of aesthetics. You are connoisseurs and we are creative. But you can teach them, you can tell them about, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be very happy to know all about these things and they\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up now in no time because they are very humble people.\nYou see to it that she [?] doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go back, you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s her mother\xe2\x80\x99s habit. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to develop in her. She\xe2\x80\x99s a great singer herself, she sings very well. All right.\nNow, who else was there?\nSahaja Yogi [Didier]: I think we have a lot of things to learn from them.\nShri Mataji: But have you noticed how they love Me so much? Because they know Me. And they know they have one Mother. Even without telling them, everything moves so smoothly. They never ask Me questions.\nEven if, when I break their traditions, they never ask. Today, for example, I said: "The girls- the mothers of the girls are going to do this." They said: "But this is done by the mothers of the boys." I said: "But the mothers of the wives are mostly foreign so they can\xe2\x80\x99t do it." "Then it\xe2\x80\x99s all right."\nI mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re so obedient and they\xe2\x80\x99re so smooth as if, you see, as if I\xe2\x80\x99m working through them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell them anything. They did it every thing on their own. I never told them anything. Because you know I was so very busy myself.\n\nNow I have to tell you that I won\xe2\x80\x99t have so much time when I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to Paris. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have three or four programs no doubt, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to move too much here and there. But Mulhouse I can go from Switzerland.\nSahaja Yogi: All right.\nShri Mataji: Mulhouse I\xe2\x80\x99ll go from Switzerland. And in any case, you telephone to Me and we\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there in the month of April. All right?\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. So may God bless you all. Enjoy yourself and now try to love each other and understand and appreciate. After Realization, you can enjoy others.\nNow Gregoire, what?\nNo hurry, you see! Just too much hurrying you have been. No need.\nJust a minute.\nSahaja Yogi: So one question Mo- so You\xe2\x80\x99re coming to February on France now.\nShri Mataji: Italians, just call Italians.\nI think too much organisation is going on and I really made the organisation for it. No don\xe2\x80\x99t organise. Please, stop it! I can see the faces there.\nPlease stop all organising and all the writing work. Stop it!\nWho organised your buses?\nGregoire: We don\xe2\x80\x99t organise anything Mataji, I think the French people didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that they are coming this evening with us.\nShri Mataji: Baba, they know it so well! Do you mean to say if you have told them they would know? Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\nGregoire: Brian told me they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nShri Mataji: Now don\xe2\x80\x99t!\nSahaja Yogi: Is it good if we are going to the hotel Mother.\nShri Mataji: But why are you all doing that!\n[Sahaja Yogis are laughing.]\nShri Mataji: Now will you please all-\n[Sahaja Yogis are laughing.]\nShri Mataji: Because I get into troubles Myself. You see, you are part and parcel of My body. Now leave it! All of you are going nicely. It will be all done. Take it easy! Sit down enjoy yourself! Come along!\n[Sahaja Yogis are laughing.]\nRelax.\nSo now, this is what we have.\n[Applause.]\nRelax! Relax!\nAll right. So now everything has been done for you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it, arranged it and I\xe2\x80\x99ll work it out. But now, you must also know I\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything for you. But you have to do something for Me. And, the only thing you have to do is to love each other. And secondly to relax.\nAll right.\nMay God bless you.\n\nShri Mataji: Now, should I see Italians? Italians are already jumping.\n\nSahaja Yogi: Please, excuse me, can I ask You one question?\nShri Mataji: All right.\nSahaja Yogi: Somebody told us You will come for the 5th of May in France because we have to register some place. Is it confirmed or we have to, no to-\n\nShri Mataji: 5th of May? You want to do it in France? Italy?\nSahaja Yogi: We have been told, Mother.\nSahaja Yogi: It has been told to us that it would be better. It\xe2\x80\x99s according to Your wish or Your desire.\nShri Mataji: You arrange, if you can, I mean whenever you arrange I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\nSahaja Yogi: All right, Mother, thank you.\nShri Mataji: All right. May God bless you.\nBut who told you that?\nSahaja Yogi: When we bought the sari for nationals, they said: "Will you buy the sari for Sahastrar Day?"\nShri Mataji: You bought it?\nSahaja Yogi: No -\nGregoire: Shri Mataji it was told that You said the Sahastrara day was in France.\nSahaja Yogi: Not me, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell but-\nShri Mataji: That?\nGregoire: That was told to me.\nShri Mataji: Oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s have it in France. Every thing\xe2\x80\x99s best for the France. But let\xe2\x80\x99s see what French give us.\nSahaja Yogi: Thank you, Mother.\nShri Mataji: All the best for the French, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. But let\xe2\x80\x99s see what they return.\nSahaja Yogi: Mother, there is a big house in Rouen, people can accommodate there.\nShri Mataji: All right, so you make it 5th of May in France, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing. But only thing is that is the best day and you should be the best people. Otherwise, when I\xe2\x80\x99ll reach there, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find people standing with sticks and guns and so I\xe2\x80\x99ll run away.\n[Shri Mataji laughs]\nAll right. May God bless you.\nEverybody should help each other.\nMay God bless you. Keep happy mood. Never do like this, you see, once you start doing like that [to frown, to scowl], it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Relax, relax!\nWhat are you worried?\nAll right.\nMay God bless you.\nNow, who else is there? Now I have to be- [end of audio]\n\nH. H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi'
