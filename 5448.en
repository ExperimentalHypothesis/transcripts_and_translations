Advice to Sahaja Yogis in Lane Cove Park, Sydney (Australia). 19 March 1983.

Shri Mataji: What a beautiful place you have!
Warren: Let’s sing Mother’s mantra.
Shri Mataji [to a baby]: Hello!
Beautiful place.
What a beautiful place, he? Beautiful place under the sun.
Sahaja Yogini: It’s ben in the flood and it’s muddy.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
It’s a nice shady place also.
Shri Mataji [to a child]: You’re playing, did you go on the river?
How can you all be sitting there, it’s so muddy.
[Cut in the video]

Is that a nest?
Warren Reeves: No, that’s a dead branch Mother, just a dead branch hanging down.
Shri Mataji: Hm.
Warren: It’s a little bit like mistletoe.
Sahaja Yogini: In this part, there are mistletoes all around.

Shri Mataji: This is the eucalyptus.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. [conversation unclear]

Sahaja Yogi: There are flowers and then they become nuts.
Shri Mataji: The one we saw? These are the same?
Warren: The same flowers that You saw in– where is it- in Adelaide.
Shri Mataji: The ones which are like Ganesha’s flowers?
Warren: Yes, yes, yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: The four petals?
Warren: But it has a much bigger base.
Shri Mataji: Let Me see.
Warren: Much better base. There are all different shapes and sizes but the one we saw had definitely, had four sections on it.

Shri Mataji: These are all different things that have eyes sorts of things. Is that the one?
Warren: [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: That was a banksia nut actually Mother.
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Sahaja Yogi: That was a banksia nut, the one You, .
Warren: It was in Perth, was it?
Sahaja Yogi: That was in Perth. It might be in four little slices.
Shri Mataji: Yes, that was another one. That was just like Ganesha.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Western Australia is famous for the flower.
Shri Mataji: Great.
Warren: In fact, in the spring time after the rains, Western Australia is just a blaze of wild flowers. It’s famous all over the world for that.
Shri Mataji: There are six, you see? Six. Yes, these are six. So, these are more Swadishthana I should say. The fragrance is different from what we get in our India.
Warren: Yes. It’s a whole range of fragrances, there are many. There are lemon scented and peppermint and -
Shri Mataji: I think one which is that is Indian. Can you get a leave out of that? Let’s see, have a look.
Warren: I think they are bringing You a selection of leaves, Mother.
Shri Mataji: In eucalyptuses.

Children are very happy in the nature. They are so full of joy, children!
Warren: They’ve all been down in the mu, in the river.

Shri Mataji: Come along!
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Look at them, look at the children. How they feel one with nature immediately, you see.

Thank you. This too has six. They are so rich.
Thank you, Mother.
Warren: They make a lot of eucalyptus oil from these.
Shri Mataji: Yes. But I feel our is very strong, Indian one. This one is not so strong. It is more chlorophyl than eucalyptus oil.
Warren: Yes, yes. Some of these branches are not so strong.

Warren: It’s the same, I think, that one Mother, it’s not the strong one.
Shri Mataji: Same, same.
Warren: There are no lemon scented ones around at all?
[Conversation between SY inaudible]
Sahaja Yogini: I’ve got a weaky one here, but there’s absolutely no scent.
Shri Mataji: This one, yes. This is the willow, weeping willow, I think.
Sahaja Yogini: No, no it’s a weaky type of [unclear] but it has no scent at all. The lemon one looks similar to that but has a beautiful scent of lemon. Not like that, that’s useless.
Shri Mataji: But this doesn’t have.
Sahaja Yogini: No.

Shri Mataji: So, this has, not that it does not. But very faint.
I think, on the whole, India has got great qualities of –
Warren: Perfume, perfume trees.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Warren: Flowers.
Shri Mataji: Flowers, everything, even Chandan is growing there. And once, I talked to a lady, a Japanese lady, I said, "I enjoy Japanese garden". And she said, "But it hasn’t got the perfume that you have in India".
Warren: Yes, that’s true.

Shri Mataji: We have trees with this Parijata [Nyctanthes arbor-tristis] otherwise, why don’t you bring next time when you come, that Parijata? Very small flowers, you must have seen with a red stem.
Warren: Red stem?
Shri Mataji: Parijata. Next time, I’ll show you if it is there. We have so many scented flowers in our country. One of them is this, of course. But we have another one which we call as Mogra [Arabian Jasmine] which comes to you somehow. You can bring all these here.
Warren: From India.
Shri Mataji: Hm.
Warren: Yes, they should grow here too.
Shri Mataji: Yes, there’s another one called Bakula [Spanish cherry, medlar, or bullet wood]. Bakula is a -looks like more like a wood like thing. Little, little flowers they have. But it’s a huge big tree and the whole place gets filled up with that.
We have so many like that! If they allow you to bring. Do they?
Warren: Well, they don’t. But if we use it discriminately, I think it will be all right. We just part it away in our bag. I mean, there’s no danger, it’s just that some people bring some dangerous seed, they become pest or become source of infection.
This is the type of tree, Mother, that we use for timber. Very, very straight.

Shri Mataji: But this is a very light wood, very light wood.
Warren: Yes. No, no, it’s a hard wood actually.
Shri Mataji: Is it? Is it very hard?
Warren: It’s heavy, weight hard wood.
Shri Mataji: all right. In India, you don’t get them hard.
Warren: In fact, it is so hard that it won’t take a nail easily.
Shri Mataji: Hm, that’s great. It’s another variety. What we get is just a waste, you see.
Warren: Mother, if you like a coke or something?
A girl: Apple juice, Mother, instead of coke?
Shri Mataji [to the girl]: I’ll have little chana first, he? Then bring anything whatever you feel like. A coke would be better.

So, yesterday was a good day
Warren: You missed a great program, last night. Yes, amazing.
Shri Mataji [to someone else]: Did you hear about it, what happened?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, we’ve been questioning people all morning about this advance of the last few days.
Shri Mataji: Tremendous.
Sahaja Yogi: Tremendous work.

Shri Mataji: We have got rid of the evil effects of mister Terence. And he is out, for ever and ever. And I have to tell all of you, who are leaders, I was telling yesterday, that we have to take very mild ways. Especially the leaders have to be extremely mild. They should not be strict, they should not get angry, they should not shout. But a very patronizing way should be. Because that’s the way they can appeal to people. All the time getting angry or disciplining is not a good thing, and judging others. That’s what he did and then he started on jumping. First, he started judging others, correcting others. Then on firmer grounds and firmer grounds.
And also, I think he did not allow it to spread to other places, because he wanted to control, this is the main thing.
Warren: Yes, this is true, he wanted it in one place.
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, it’s apple juice [unclear].

Warren: Even, that is part of the reasons why the ashram at [inaudible] failed Mother, because he basically did not want it to be.
Shri Mataji: Yes. He has had a very bad influence on everyone, very bad influence. Floaty [unsure] influence but of a very bad nature.

And egoistical people is that. But John was like this sometimes and don’t try to get rid of. But John must learn a lesson now, that all kinds of ego must be dropped. Thought he is drop out of Sahaja Yoga, he and his wife, permanently, they have nothing to do, nothing to do! The amount of damage he has done to Sahaja Yoga, you can’t imagine! So many people came in the party- I mean, in the hall- up to the [?] and told Me that because of Warren they left Sahaja Yoga.
Sahaja Yogi: Because of Terence.
Shri Mataji: Because of Terence.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: I still combine him with you.
Warren: I don’t mind Mother.
Shri Mataji: Yes, because he was so much identified and he just used mu name under his name.
Warren: Yes, he did Mother.
Shri Mataji: Very nasty fellow. Very rotten person, rotten to the core and the way he behaved, did they tell you? It’s very shameful to behave like that.
And I could telephone to his father-in-law and the father-in-law told Me there were very ashamed of themselves, this, that. I said, "This is a permanent [unclear] now." You do what you like and then just you say, "Sorry". Nothing doing, we are not going to have anymore of that.
And she [the wife] is a liar. She has told him lots of stories. She made a big thing out of him as if he was something special. She was – not at all! In India, she is not regarded as even a Sahaja Yogini. So many people don’t think her to be a Sahaja Yogini. She was out of Sahaja Yoga for five years for misbehaving. And she thinks no end of herself. These dream and all those businesses, you should all forget these nonsensical things that she told you. That, "This is the dream we are having" and "Dreams, they came and told me". Carry [unsure], I’m rather worried because you have been with that horrible fellow. Better beat him with shoes and that, every day. Can you go and do it now, nicely?

Horrible fellow.
Actually, I never though him anything good, much. But mister Warren was rather anxious that he should be pulled in within. And when I said that, "Warren is you leader". He said, "You should also take the name of Terence". I never thought him to be something good. But it was a nice thing that he came down, it allowed Me to see him, he was exposed, and that’s how we got rid of him properly.
Warren: That was the idea. Mother that’s why. We wanted him to go away.
Shri Mataji: To go away.
Warren: So, everybody could see it, not just Sydney ashram, or Melbourne or somewhere.
Shri Mataji: Really good [unsure].

He has done nothing for Sahaja Yoga, nothing so far. So many marriages he’s broken, so many people he’s talked rude, he’s talked roughly. Isn’t it? And some of them are not willing to come back because of this. He said horrible things, you know. Maybe your wife also, maybe one of them, I don’t know. Just find out. Christine told Me that it is him who created a problem for her. He’s been- Christine took that ego behaviour.

Shri Mataji: [...] Like soups and things.
Sahaja Yogini: One month old -
Shri Mataji: Yes, you should start. A little bit soup, it’s all right. Nothing wrong.
Warren: Strained.
Shri Mataji: Strained, absolutely strained, just water but, little soup and little things like that would be good for them.
Warren: Some barley water, some barley soup and -
Shri Mataji: Barley water little bit. Barley water is very good. Barley water, or you can start with juices, if you like, and then go to soups and then to, I mean, they, the system must get used to that, you see. Gradually you must bring round children to food. Not suddenly the heavy food.
Sahaja Yogini: Adrian is six months. He hasn’t had anything yet because we got the message that you said that it was six months that they should have food for the first time.
Shri Mataji: Food is different, I mean. Not below six.
Warren: Clear, liquid.
Sahaja Yogini: But, you know, that’s the way we -
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no. Food means solid food. Solid food. You see, what, you can give them rice and dhal cooked together, make it very, because it will train up the system properly. First, you start with juices. Then come to soups and then come to solid food, in the sense that it is semi-solid. You can cook rice and dhal together, make a kitcheree. She knows that, how to make it. Thin it out and give it to the child. That you can do, but not this dhal. Moong dhal. Moong dhal, moong dahl and rice, you can cook together and start with that, after six months. Food means, when there are solid parts. But juices and soups you must have.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes
Shri Mataji: It’s important.
Warren: And water.
Shri Mataji: And water, you should start immediately. After a month, you should start water, boiled water, you must have. But I saw your child getting, isn’t it? Your child was having water all right?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Yes. What is her age?
Sahaja Yogini: She’s ten months now Mother.
Warren: Ten months.
Shri Mataji: Ah, ten months, achcha. But when you started?
Warren: At what age?
Sahaja Yogini: They always had water, right from the very beginning Mother.
Shri Mataji: They have had water.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That’s good. So, they had water.
1:20:03

Now what else you wanted to know?

Q: The baby's waking at night, Mother. What do we do to get them out of waking up at night-time?

Shri Mataji: You see, there are, because they're wet, in the night. That's why they get up, isn't it? Or for no rhyme and reason.

Q: Yes, for no rhyme or reason.

Shri Mataji: All right. So what you have to do is to massage their body with oil and massage their head with oil and put a lot of oil in their heads, you see, and then put some powder and clean it up. Give them a massage in the night. They sleep very well. They won't get up. In the night you should give them a massage in case they are restless in the night or something like that, before sleeping. You give them their last meal, say - about what time is it, their last? Eight o'clock, or six o'clock?

Q: It depends on their age. Gabriel and Luke have their dinner at about six o'clock. Adrian has, he goes to bed at about, last meal at about seven thirty, eight, eight o'clock.

Shri Mataji: All right. So, what you do, six o'clock, you give him one feed, all right? And nine o'clock, another one. You can feed him one more in the night, so they won't be hungry, but in between you can give a massage on the body. Say, about seven o'clock you can do the massage. All right? So 7.30, then, he goes to bed. Nine o'clock in his sleep he must have, in his sleep, and then in the morning he'll get up at about five, that's all. Very simple. Five or six. But I think you people don't massage the body so much as prescribed. You have to massage it twice in the beginning, twice: one in the night; one in the daytime. All right? Now what else?

WR: When do they stop breast-feeding, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Ten months. Gradually, they should take to bottle. Ten months they can stop, then twelve, you see. In India they used to stop after three years. Nobody is bothered, but it's better to stop it by ten, eleven months or so.

WR: If they don't get the mother's milk, say, they have to cut it short -

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. You should take to bottle. No harm in giving them bottle milk. Do it properly. But you see if you do not give them nipple in the mouth of the child, of the bottle, from the very beginning, or say about one or two months or three months at the most, they won't take it easily. The best is to give once, one feed, at, say, three months. Start giving them one feed. When the child is sleeping you give one feed, when the child is used to the nipple. You have to understand the child has to get used to everything. Then they easily move. But otherwise is problems?

Q: Yes, yes, Mother. They were started at six months but then they just don't want to eat the food that we've given them. Some of the other babies, that have been eating solid food for a while -

Shri Mataji: But the food is not tasty.

Q: It's not tasty.

Shri Mataji: You must make it tasty, and you see, you must put proper salt. Salt must be properly put and a little taste must be made, little bit of butter, little bit. You see, you must make it tasty. Otherwise the food is not tasty. They don't like it, on the tongue, just like us.

WR: Tell them, Mother, in Sydney, they must have salt in their food and they must have-

Shri Mataji: Oh, this is a very funny idea, not to have salt. Do you all suffer from high blood pressure?

WR: In Melbourne they refused to put any salt in food -

Shri Mataji: You see, without salt you cannot do your respiration. Ask any doctor. If there is no sodium chloride in your blood, you see, your respiration will go down. These things are essential for [unclear], but not too much of everything. Salt is needed for food. I mean, these are all funny ideas that are coming up, but the worst thing is that you are so naïve, just look like children. I mean, if anybody tells you, "Don't take salt", just the, they know you must be coming from lunatic asylum. But if you are suffering from high blood pressure, or if there's a problem of diet or something, then you fix. Salt is very important for teeth, for everything. To feel relaxed, is the best way to reduce the blood pressure. What else is there?

WR: There's also a belief that if you give children sweet foods, as a small baby and child, that it will grow up and have blood sugar problems. So they give very sour, sour lemons, sour fruits -

Shri Mataji: You see, I told you that, you see, that how blood sugar comes in because of diabetes, isn't it, not because of sugar. It comes only because of diabetes. Diabetes comes because of thinking too much.

If you make your child educated all the time, you want him to think and do this very well in the school at the age of five years, if you want him to do "O" levels, then what is it? So you see, you want to make the child into a competition. What is left over by [unclear]. Take it easy. Let the child study, as well as grow normally.

WR: Is it wise for the baby to sleep in the same bed as the parents? And up to what age, Mother?

Shri Mataji: It's very small to face. Not every time. It's not proper, you know. I don't approve all the time, but little bit while, and then the child must sleep in the, always be sleeping in his bed. Always, sleeping in his bed is the best, but in the same room, not in some other room. But then you should take the baby with you when you are nursing or anything. For a while, that's all. But mostly the child should be in the bed. It's not only the parents who should sleep in between the [unclear].

WR: Until what age should young children be kept in the same bedroom?

Shri Mataji: I mean, you are now my children sleeping, so what can I tell you? You see, you are different type of people. We don't undress ourselves immediately. That's the problem. I hope Sahaja Yogis are not sleeping like that. Please don't sleep without clothes. The bhoots will enter with you. You must wear your clothes when you're asleep. I'm telling you, don't sleep without clothes. The bhoots, that's the best way the bhoots enter you. What is the need? I don't understand.

Q: Mother, some of the babies have been experiencing a lot of pain while they're cutting their teeth, while their teeth are coming through.

Shri Mataji: There's a very old medicine, called treatment powder, treatment powder. Write it down.

WR: Yes, I know that one.

Shri Mataji: Get some ivory ring. They're very good for teeth. Ivory ring.

WR: Teething ring.

Shri Mataji: Ivory ring. You get them in India. You get your plastic ones. You get ivory ones. You get some of these. These are very good for children.

WR: Albert, you'd better get them. Ivory ring, ring. Teething ring.

Q: Mother, another question. What do You think about dummies for the baby?

Shri Mataji: Dummies?

Q: Yes. You know what dummies are? The little rubber thing shaped like a nipple, to an extent, and -

Shri Mataji: You see, they might develop their, their teeth are coming out if you have too much of that.

Q: Yes, if you give too much, but a little bit of, maybe to settle the baby down to sleep.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] all right. A little bit is all right, but try to put it away. It's the best is to give Vishuddhi treatment and not have it. Otherwise the teeth will be very parallel and you will have a lot of problems settling them back. Little bit you can give that. They are called as dummies, are they?

Q: Dummies, they're called, yes. Dummy nipples.

Shri Mataji: Oh, all right, no harm.

WR: They want to know about toilet training, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What is that? What is that?

WR: How to stop the baby from wetting the nappies, and using the pot, basically.

Shri Mataji: About at the age of only two months or three months, you must start [unclear: sounds like putting or touching] the bottom of the baby to a pot, you see. Keep a little pot like that and try to, say, make some sounds like that and all that. The child starts doing it and he gets used to the touch, you see, of the thing. Then he knows, that's an impulse, you see, in him, that acts as a message and you can do, very simple.

Q: Very early, then?

Shri Mataji: Very early you must start it. Very early. You see, -

Q: We don't do that.

Shri Mataji: I think because [unclear: sounds like you have these [unclear] or, you haven't tried this yet]

WR: Freud, Mr Freud said we shouldn't do it, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Why?

WR: It'll give you a complex.

Shri Mataji: What? What is a complex? A complex? We all Indians do it. We don't have any complexes, I think. The one who has given the real complex is Mr Freud himself. What complex is [unclear: sounds like kya hoa].

WR: All this nonsense about how you were toilet trained and if you, if you, it explains why you behave in a certain way when you're grown up and according to how you sat on the potty and - really, it's true, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You don't even know what you see. What a thing you are bothered about.

Q: Another question, Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's why you people are very addicted to bathrooms also. We are not. You see, we are there hardly for five, ten minutes, have a bath, get out of it, you see. Addiction comes from that kind of a thing. You're very bathroom concerned. That's why.

WR: All this graffiti business [unclear]. Graffiti, writing on the walls, all this stuff. It's all coming from that.

Shri Mataji: You said, writing on the walls? You know, the best thing if you are constipated, take a newspaper, you see, and have it used. That's how I feel some people have treated them. They say, "You get constipated". I say, "Read a newspaper in the morning". That's the place you should read the newspaper, actually; nowhere else. That's the [unclear: sounds like big] word. Nothing else, you know. I would do that when I don't get any chance or anything. I would say that, better read the newspaper, in the bathroom. That's the place, because such filth in there. No, no, no, no. I tell you he must be a sweeper in his last life. Must be something wrong with Mr Freud, I think. Must have been a sweeper.

WR: Twelve years ago in England, Mother, there was a man called Dr Alex Comfort who's basically a descendant of Freudian psychology who said that you should have contraceptives available in the marketplace for children to buy as from the age of twelve. So that's how far we've gone.

Shri Mataji: From what?

WR: Contraception, you see, you know the -

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see! You see, another joke. I thought it must be for constipation.

WR: Maybe that, too. That's instead of the newspaper.

Shri Mataji: Boys don't even understand these things.

WR: They do here, Mother, in the west.

Shri Mataji: In the west? Maybe here they are over grown. You don't allow them to be natural, putting all these ideas into their heads. Twelve years old!

Q: Mother, I have some more questions. What should the mothers do about constipation in the baby, babies?

Shri Mataji: You see, they should not have constipation themselves.

Q: Well, they do when they're on the formula mixtures.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] we have so many ways of removing in India. Like you take that adjwain [unclear] and all that, all the time when the [unclear] Lax or raisins, dried ones, raisins, like raisins, with fruits, with the orange juice. Orange juice is very good. And also milk, boiled milk in the night.

Q: Cow's milk?

Shri Mataji: Mm, very good.

Q: That's another thing, Mother. When they're weaned from the mother's breast, are they weaned onto cow's milk?

Shri Mataji: To what?

Q: Cow's milk.

WR: From breast to cow's milk, or from breast to formula mixture?

Shri Mataji: I mean, really, cow's milk, because these formula nowadays, I don't know what -

WR: It makes black stools, it's very -

Shri Mataji: If you get cow's milk, better is to remove the cream, put the water in it, and boil it, remove the cream, and that's the best for the children. But boil it together, not separately. Always boil the milk and the water together, never separately.

WR: So all these mothers on formula should transfer to cow's milk?

Shri Mataji: Uh?

WR: All these mothers who are feeding their babies on formula, on this mixture, on this powdered stuff, should change to cow's milk?

Shri Mataji: This, I mean, if the children can digest cow's milk, that's the right thing, if they can digest it. But you must know what is the amount of water you should put.

WR: Proportion.

Shri Mataji: Because it's more natural to take to cow's milk.

Q: [unclear]

WR: Well, you're supposed to be feeding them off the breast.

Q: If you can't feed them off the breast?

WR: If you can't feed them off the breast that's when you go to -

Shri Mataji: No, but what we do then, if it's for some time, you can take formula because might be it is better according to their age group but, say, after ten months they can take to cow's milk, all right. But little bit one thing you should start by the time they are about three months, before they are conscious. One time. One feed. Is she giving one feed at least to the baby, or not? No, not yet. No, no, not her. I'm saying - Barbara! Barbara, is she giving one feed to the baby?

Barbara: No, Mother. Only breast milk. Only breast.

Shri Mataji: You should start now, all right? Otherwise again he'll be very angry with the bottle.

Q: He is, Mother. I've tried him on the bottle before. He doesn't like it.

Shri Mataji: So, better start earlier always. One feed you must have earlier. Say, one month, you can start, because children here are very adamant style, you see.

Q: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What other things?

Q: Medication for children, Mother. A lot of Panadol's given to the baby.

Shri Mataji: Panadol?

Q: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: For what?

Q: For temperatures or irritabilities, teething, when the baby's crying or upset.

Shri Mataji: I don't think Panadol is a very good cure.

WR: It contains, it's aspirin, isn't it?. No, Paracetamol.

Shri Mataji: It can make the child very bad later on [unclear: sounds like without effects].

WR: Liver problems?

Shri Mataji: Oh, really? Not good. You see, for, say, a child is [unclear: sounds like irritable] or anything, you see, you should find out what is exactly the trouble. Is it due to the stomach [unclear: trouble or problem] or anything? Then according to that you should give. But there are natural things that you should give to the baby and not unnatural. Say, child has got a diarrhea. All right. A simple method is to boil this fennel seeds and milk together. Boil it. Keep it ready and give that with little sugar or candy sugar, and give that to the child twice, thrice. [unclear]. Simple things like that, I can give you so many medicines. Very simple. You should see why the child is sick. This Panadol is something like a sleeping pill only.

Q: Yes, it is.

Shri Mataji: That's very bad..

Q: Another question, Mother. One of our -

WR: What about Gripe Water, Mother? Do you use that?

Shri Mataji: The baby is all right, but what about the mother? Mother has to take it [unclear: sounds like out now, or as well] for wind, what you can get here. You must be having some medicines for wind?

WR: Oh, just the usual ones, Mother.

Shri Mataji: [unclear]

WR: What do you use?

Q: Is it water, water or the Gripe Water has [unclear]?

WR: It's fairly innocuous, isn't it? But, do they boil the alcohol off it?

Shri Mataji: What is that?

WR: It originally has some small volume of alcohol.

Q: Yes, four percent.

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Q: Four percent alcohol.

Shri Mataji: In what?

Q: In Gripe Water.

Shri Mataji: No, we don't use Gripe Water for the children at all. We give this adjwain water to the mother. There's another way is to - adjwain is the only thing I know very [unclear] because - I'll find out for you if there is something else you can use.

Q: Should the mothers have a diet avoiding wind-producing food?

Shri Mataji: Ah, of course! They should not eat rice at all. They should not eat rice. They should not eat anything that is grown under the earth. Potato, also, they should not. Anything like that. Rice, potatoes, all these things must be avoided.

Q: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: You don't know these.

WR: No, we're very basic [unclear].

Shri Mataji: Rice is never given to a woman who has got babies, till about ten months. She must avoid eating rice.

Warren: So, any wind-producing food should be avoided in the mother.

Shri Mataji: Everything that comes from the Mother Earth, in the sense, from the bowels of the Mother Earth, and also milk. Milk gives wind, very much. Milk [unclear: sounds like gives it] but milk boiled in a iron pot, could be made out of steel but not the stainless one, the other one, doesn't [unclear: use or it].

Q: Milk boiled in a steel pot, cast iron, cast iron, doesn't give wind?

Shri Mataji: So you should boil that milk with the water, whatever it is, together in an iron pot.

Q: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: So, milk should not be taken like that by mothers direct, at all. If she has to take milk, then take it with some sort of a porridge or something, at the most. She has to take milk, no doubt. But she should take it with the porridge, or the fresh [unclear: figs or foods or fruits] or something like that.

Q: Yes, Mother.

WR: What about nappies, Mother? Some of the nappies make their legs go out at forty-five degrees.

Shri Mataji: Oh, that's horrible thing that you make the children wear [unclear]. Very handy, but it's very bad. This girl has suffered so much. Even now she has problems, see? It's plastic stuff. But we don't use plastic stuff. We use cotton ones, nice cotton ones and we put little, what you call, absorbent cotton.

WR: I think we call them flannelette napkins here, Mother.

Shri Mataji: And then we remove the cotton. If the napkin is also wet, we remove the napkin. It can be washed. You see, we can have about twelve or, say, twenty-four, shaped like that. It's very simple, how to make it. I'll show you. This is the [unclear: shape or way], shape the napkin. So you, get a soft cloth, some sort of a [unclear: sounds like emollient] or something. In India you get such a lot of, very nice [unclear]. Now, what you do is to make it like that. All right? Now, [unclear] not a thing like this. It's for a little baby. But you can have soft toweling [unclear].

Q: We get, we get soft toweling. The way, many of us do it that way.

Shri Mataji: All right! And then you must wash them. Hardly it takes any time for you to wash. And in a day you take about, in the beginning they are small and you need more number. Later on, you don't need them but you don't have all these problems of the plastics for the baby, and the child is allowed to breathe. His body grows well. Otherwise, they have, the backside is so pushed in, funny figures and you also have what you call the legs going like that.

WR: Your hip joints go -

Shri Mataji: Very bad. It's very wrong and should be avoided.

Q: You mean the disposables, or do you mean?

Shri Mataji: The disposables are not good thing. Only if you are going out somewhere, see? This kind of a cloth is the best. This is a soft one. This is very good. Still, for a little newly born is still smaller. You see, we don't want to seal it, not to seal it at all. It's hard. You see, just take, open it out, just like that. We don't seal it [unclear] like that. It's too big. For a big child, is all right. All right? Now, that's all. Even if you want you can put like this for a big boy. Here a little fold, but normally, for a little baby, small. So the child is allowed to -
