b'"The Guru Principle", Caxton Hall, London (UK), 28 July 1980.\n\nYesterday I told you about the Void, the dharma, which one has to establish.\n\nIn modern times, people have used their freedom to such an extent, you see, they have moved so much to this extreme or to that extreme. They have left their central path and have accepted and identified themselves with such an extreme ideas about everything, that it is rather difficult to convince people that they have lost their way. All extremes are wrong. Moderation is the way we really solve the problem. But human race is such that everybody starts running very fast, you see, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a competition set in: who goes first to hell. [Laughter, She laughs]\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not only in one direction, you can take up any direction, but all these directions are linear. They move straightforward and coil back and go down \xe2\x80\x93 any movement of that kind. For example take our, say, industrial development.\n\nWe started our industrial development without understanding the whole, the world as a whole, that the whole world was created by God, not a part, one country. Without understanding the relationship with the whole, when we start moving industrially, we created industries, and to pamper them we had to create other industries. Then also to keep the hungry machines working out, we had to feed them with something.\n\nAnd thus we created a horrible system of extracting things from the Mother Earth, using them. We have so many things, but we do not have the thing which is your Spirit.\n\nWe never thought that, after all, all this matter is for what? All these things are for what? For comfort? That also, if not done in moderation, we are going to be ruined, completely ruined. We\xe2\x80\x99ll become like worms.\n\nThe Mother Earth is available to you, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should be indiscriminate and use it for your comfort. She\xe2\x80\x99s there for your comfort, no doubt, She\xe2\x80\x99s the comforting element we have got, the greatest comforting element. But we do not know how to use Her for our comfort. The way we use Her is by taking out, extracting Her. Now if I say that, the other extreme would be: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have no possessions, nothing, live, hang by the string, some shoestring somewhere\xe2\x80\x9d. [She laughs] There are people who believe in such a thing also, who want to live on a shoestring and have all kinds of diseases, physical, mental, because they are living abnormally, in such a way that they do not relate themselves to the Mother Earth at all. Either you abstract completely whatever She has, or take away all Her flesh, blood, everything, and otherwise you have nothing to do. These are two extremes!\n\nAnd once you start doing like that, you find that you become slave to both ways, because you start forming habits with the help of this matter. Habit formation is slavery, complete slavery, even a habit formation like fasting. Now some people have to fast. Who has asked them to fast I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What is the need to fast for people who are already suffering from liver troubles and thin like sticks?\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, somebody has to fast because, supposing he has too much weight, or say they want some rest to the stomach, is all right. But this fasting also can become such a habit, such a habit, that the day you do not fast you\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! You have done the greatest crime on the Earth. Oh God, I did not fast on Thursday, I should have fasted.\xe2\x80\x9d In India we get so many mad people like that. [Laughter] They go crazy because they have not fasted. There are some who get crazy because they have not eaten their food. I mean they are all right, but if they have not taken their lunch, for them it\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest injury, the greatest injustice done to them that they have not been able to take their lunch.\n\nThe matter starts enslaving you and your mind becomes a slave of that matter. You do not know in what way this Mother Earth, which is there to give you the ultimate, She\xe2\x80\x99s the one who resides within you at the Mooladhara Chakra to give you the innocence. She gives you the innocence. Instead of taking that essence of Hers, the innocence, what you take is the matter which is dead. The living principle of Mother Earth is innocence, Her magnetism, Her gravity. Instead of that, what do you take out of Her is this matter. Either you run away from it, or you run towards it. Nothing in between.\n\nNow matter is there for you to use, no doubt; but to use so that you do not get dominated by it, because you are the supreme thing God has created. You are the supreme-most thing; all the elements are working in you. There\xe2\x80\x99s no animal in the world who has all these elements working in such a beautiful fashion that you develop your own will, your own freedom. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a intricate process which has worked out a human being, which we don\xe2\x80\x99t realize, where you develop your own will, your own freedom.\n\nBut again, with your own will what do you do is to lose your freedom all the time. For example, take a person who indulges in luxuries. I mean he is idiotic sometimes, I mean he really becomes an idiot the way he goes on. I mean you can see that he\xe2\x80\x99s an idiot and stupid fellow. The another one, he will say that this luxury is \xe2\x80\x93 indulgence fellow is very, very idiotic and stupid you can see. So he says, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, let me give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d He goes to another extreme, to such an extreme that he becomes a dry person, absolutely dry.\n\nThe innocence is in the centre.\n\nFor example, the best use of the Mother Earth is to watch Her working. Watch the nature. Watch every tree, what beautiful personality every tree has. Every leaf of the tree stands against the sky. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s such a poetry to feel Her with your feet. How soft She is when She produces flowers for you. You have to learn so much from what She does. She creates a flower to emit fragrance, to give, to give, to give. She just gives. Her innocence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother as to what you are, whether you deserve it or not, whether you are a good person or a bad person or what use you are going to put Her resources, She just gives. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t judge you. Nirvaj \xe2\x80\x93 it flows. The capital flows without any interest. It just goes on flowing and flowing and that\xe2\x80\x99s the word of nirvaj is. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think to whom She is giving to, whether they deserve it or not, if they are sinners or they are this or that. But now it is for you to use your wisdom. And She has created this deity [Ganesha] of wisdom within you, and you have to keep that deity awakened.\n\nHe came, incarnated on this Earth as Jesus Christ. Look at Him. Look at His life. How He lived. He was a carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s son; He lived like a carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s son. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t amass money.\n\nAnd what a dynamic life in thirty years of His age! What a dynamic life, out of which He spent only four years in the public.\n\nWith all our indulgences and with all our comforts, with all our movements and aeroplanes and all this, how many there are who have created such a dynamic life? What dynamism have we been able to show, the dynamism of the Mother Earth. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must have this, we must have that, we must get this, we must enjoy this,\xe2\x80\x9d All right. But what is the ultimate? I mean how much we have been able to absorb it and what have we - giving others, what is our fruit of this tree that we are?\n\nThe reason is, we have lacked wisdom. He was wisdom. He is the One who emits wisdom, who balances our ego, superego, everything. You know where He stands, that Deity. But the people who followed Him, or who called themselves Christians, where is the wisdom gone? Wisdom is one thing lacking in all of them.\n\nWhat is the reason? Because we just thought that He was crucified because He was a poor Man? Or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we thought of Him. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand human beings, what is the lesson we have taken from His life? And the Christian nations have advanced so much materially. Can you imagine? They do not know that poverty is such a blissful thing sometimes.\n\nAnd then now a reaction has started. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure reaction will also take you to another extreme, you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the point. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a madman running to one end and when he goes from there he runs to another end.\n\nHave you ever seen a wild boar running? Have you ever seen a wild boar running? You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to get out of the way of a wild boar because he just runs straightforward, till he meets some opposition. Straightforward. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see this side, that side. If you can just keep away from the line from where he\xe2\x80\x99s moving he will not hit you. Then again he comes back in the same way. Goes this way, comes back. [Laughter]That is our movement has been about ourselves. What have we done out of our life? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. While we are capable, we are the seeds which are going to render the real fruits. We are capable, you know now that. And that is why first of all we have done the greatest harm to ourselves by ruining all our sustenance within ourselves. As I told you the other day in the lecture, that how we have to maintain our sustenance.\n\nI hope it was not too much for you to - if you feel that I was trying to tell the people also they say, a group of people who think this is all conditioning. Actually, we are so confused in modern times about everything. Supposing a plane has to take off, all its parts are to be in a proper proportion, are to be tied together to the main body. Otherwise everything will go helter-skelter, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Now if you have to jump into your unconscious, all your parts of the being should be attached to the gravity of the body, to your sustenance, otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99ll go helter-skelter. Will you say that a - putting the plane in that way is conditioning it, for its freedom? You have much more freedom when it is properly done.\n\nA person who is properly prepared for this flight, has much more freedom than people who think that one nose is lying this, and ears are lying on the other side, then eyes are going on the other side, his mind is going on the third side, his stomach is going on the other side. [Laughter]\n\nHere he is listening to Me and he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of his food. His eyes are looking at something else. His feet are moving. He\xe2\x80\x99s jumpy. There\xe2\x80\x99s no proper binding. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the conditioning has a word in Sanskrit language as samskara. Samskar. Now \xe2\x80\x9csam\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cgood, beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d or you can say \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are good to your Spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d Even to add to that they can say \xe2\x80\x9csusamskara,\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cgood conditionings,\xe2\x80\x9d where you are to be chiselled out.\n\nAnd in that chiselling, if you understand it is for not only your good, but for your flight, then you do not give everything to the winds. And this is the biggest mistake we have committed, when we started on the flight of our freedom.\n\nHow can you have your freedom when you are bound by everything?\n\nYou must go to the pub in the evening. You must go for your dancing [Laughter]. You must see a friend who smokes and must smoke with him. You have to attend a party where you have to drink. You must sleep at some particular time. Because you cannot sleep, so you must take pills. You have to have girlfriends or boyfriends, spend money on their \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you call \xe2\x80\x93 dates, and things like that. I mean, how frivolous the whole thing sounds to Me. Same thing in India. I mean they have other frivolities.\n\nBut when you understand through your Self Realization your self-esteem, then you try to think: \xe2\x80\x9cThen what have I done of my life?\xe2\x80\x9d You are like diamonds thrown into dust. You must find out your relative relationship with all these useless things where the money is wasted, you are frittered away, your time is wasted, everything wasted, just find out. Once you discover that, then you start detaching yourself from that. But first and foremost thing I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say \xe2\x80\x93 it is may call conditioning or anything \xe2\x80\x93 are these important things are, ten things I told you the other time.\n\nNow all the gurus, all the gurus who came, say from we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses \xe2\x80\x93 this is the Guru Tattwa, is the principle of master, primordial masters. The principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Adi Nath, we had one Adi Nath, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattatreya, we had Janaka, Nanaka, Sai Nath. We had in the Middle East Mohammed Sahib, Lao Tse in China, Confucius \xe2\x80\x93 all these great Principles of Gurus who were born, they had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization, you must understand, everyone has one\xe2\x80\x99s own job.\n\nSee Mine is a horrible job [She laughs] because I have to do everybody\xe2\x80\x99s jobs.\n\nBut Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time, in those places where it was needed the most.\n\nSo these ten principles as I told you, They established. They are created in the Void, as you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. So whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere they wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where \xe2\x80\xa6like in \xe2\x80\xa6 Nanaka has created a Panja Sahab they call it, everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.\n\nWater is the life, life force which sustains us; without water we cannot live, that is the sustenance. But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustenance. If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have no sustenance. Christ has said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the salt.\xe2\x80\x9d Who are these \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d? Are the people whom I was facing yesterday and today.\n\nYou are the gurus of today.\n\nBut see with how many powers you have come. Just think of it. These Gurus did not have to give Realization. You can raise the Kundalini, you can give Realization, you can cure people.\n\nToday Djamel asked Me that: \xe2\x80\x9cMother did They have the powers to cure?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cPowers They might have, but They\xe2\x80\x99d never use that power because They were not supposed to do; They were just to sustain and imbibe these great principles.\xe2\x80\x9d They did cures, specially the last Guru was Sai Nath, He did cure people. But Djamel himself has cured a lady who was dying, absolutely. Doctors had given up hopes and he cured her. Now she is out and she\xe2\x80\x99s gone to India.\n\nJust think of it, that you have all the powers of these gurus, though \xe2\x80\x93 though in dharma you are still failing. You are not absolute. You have to get it corrected, your dharmas are to be corrected.\n\nNow what is dharma within us, is our attention. As our attention is, you can make out the dharma of a person. Religion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t convey that word. Dharma means the one which sustains you, "Dharayeti sa dharma", the one which sustains you. Your dharma is the way your attention is. To have a complete balanced attention is just like the aeroplane, completely balanced and fully developed. If you have an imbalance in your dharma, the first and foremost thing is fanaticism. If you are a fanatic, then you are the greatest adharmi ever born. Dharma is balancing. First and foremost is to know that all the dharmas belong to one lotus: Nabhi.\n\nNabhi has got ten petals and these ten petals are the ten sustenance within us. If you see that the Nabhi has got ten petals \xe2\x80\x93 Nabhi center, the solar plexus, which manifests all of solar plexus. And if your, these ten sustenance are correct, your attention will be so balanced. Unless and until a flower is balanced it is not going to blossom out into a fruit.\n\nFirst is the balance. All fanaticism of any kind, of condemning any religion or any incarnation is against dharma. That gives you an imbalance. That means you have not understood the essence of dharma because you are blind.\n\nTo say that there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with what Christ has preached is as wrong as saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong what Moses has preached, or Dattatreya has preached, or Nanaka has preached. Actually, Mohammed Sahib thought that He has said whatever was necessary, so that there is no need for Him to come back. But when He saw these horrible fanatics, even today they are, He thought, \xe2\x80\x9cBaba, better let Me take again the birth, what to do now with these madcaps? The thing that I preached, they are just going against it. Because I said I will not come, so they are becoming such fanatics.\xe2\x80\x9d He had to take His birth because, you see, human beings are such foolish things that these incarnations don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they will behave!\n\nSo He took His birth again as Nanaka on this Earth, and His own daughter, Adi Shakti, was born as His sister. What Nanaka was preaching throughout and throughout was this: that Hindu and Muslims are the same in the eyes of God, and that you all combine together and become one.\n\nIf there is anything that He has taught or Kabira has taught is this and this and this. But look at the Sikhs, the way they fight the Muslims; and look at the way the Muslims fight the Sikhs in India. We have created two nations out of it. Imagine! What He preached is just the opposite people are doing about it. How do you explain I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I mean when somebody has said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is light,\xe2\x80\x9d how do you make it darkness I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. This is the speciality of human beings, is to create darkness out of light.\n\nNow this dharma that They preached, is preached by all of Them, and They have been particularly against all that goes against awareness, because if your attention is not all right your awareness will not be all right. And so They were very anxious \xe2\x80\x93 all throughout, all of Them \xe2\x80\x93 that They preached that don\xe2\x80\x99t take anything that will reduce your awareness. That\xe2\x80\x99s why They were against alcoholism, They were against drugs and things like that. There were no cigarettes at the times perhaps, when Mohammed Sahib came in, so He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take any cigarettes,\xe2\x80\x9d because cigarettes came later on. But Nanaka said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo cigarettes at all.\xe2\x80\x9d Now you are finding out that cigarette causes cancer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt only causes cancer, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, because cancer \xe2\x80\x93 at the most the body will die again you\xe2\x80\x99ll be born again. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not that. That creates a problem in the Vishuddhi, so bad that you cannot get your Realization so many of you, takes time, and your poor Mother has to work for your cigarette enjoyment for days together. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very hard, you know that.\n\nThen the drug people. They have enjoyed their drugs very nicely. They have been taking drugs, you see, enjoying themselves, going high, or whatever they call it. Ask Me. How much I had to work, with tears in My eyes because I know you are saints, you are meant to be higher people, and how much I had to struggle to get you out. Can you imagine, for four years I was struggling with six hippies in London [laughter]. Six only. And first lot came to Me who were really pleased, they had done a good job out of themselves. The only advantage was they had taken LSD and all that so they were on supraconscious level, and they could see only light coming out of Me, they saw all supraconscious things, lights and things and all that, so they stuck on to Me. Or I stuck on to them, all right, but they also stuck on to Me.\n\nToday they are one of the best Sahaja Yogis we have here. They are the topmost Sahaja Yogis. They are the most beautiful Sahaja Yogis we can say, because they were saints I could see their Spirit shining. I could not lose that sight, worked very hard for them. They are saints. They got lost into drugs because they thought they are seeking. They did not do it out of fashion.\n\nIn India you see, when the Indian young people see you taking drugs, they think, \xe2\x80\x9cOh must be something great.\xe2\x80\x9d You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s very fashionable nowadays in India for young people to take drugs and wear jeans. They think by that they are getting sophisticated [laughter]. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you did it, they really do not know. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you did it in seeking. They are such foolish Indians, you see, that they are doing it because they think that it\xe2\x80\x99s very fashionable, you know. Everybody will call them \xe2\x80\x9cup-to-date\xe2\x80\x9d [laughter]. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you left your homes, why you became like this. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know the deeper side of your life, they just see superficially. And it\xe2\x80\x99s very common now in the universities and things, this has started in a big way. But they are no good for Sahaja Yoga, useless people trying to copy. How can they copy your seeking, that depth?\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why these people were very much against all those things that dulls your awareness. Even now I have seen people who have been taking drugs and all that, in Sahaja Yoga. As soon as they see Me they start, \xe2\x80\x9chaah,\xe2\x80\x9d sleeping. They go into sleep. Because immediately, as soon as you start taking these drugs or all these alcohols, you move towards your left side, or to your right side. Mostly to your left side. Alcohol specially, left side. By moving your left side, you see, you go into your collective subconscious, you cross over to your Ida Nadi and goes beyond your subconscious into collective subconscious. You become very non-aggressive, no doubt. It is also because of too much of consciousness that you are egoistical, you have started doing this. You thought that \xe2\x80\x9cOh, our ego is too much.\xe2\x80\x9d You can\xe2\x80\x99t see your ego, so you said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, let\xe2\x80\x99s have some drinks.\xe2\x80\x9d By that you go on the other side. When you start moving too much towards the left you know what happens: you get possessed, because there are satanic forces let loose, you get caught up. Now when you come to Sahaja Yoga after that, you are always dragged, you always feel the heaviness at the back, all of you. Left Agnya, not the right \xe2\x80\x93 superego. You feel very sleepy; you feel like crying, weeping all the time; you feel very much frightened; you cannot take any decision; any question comes in, any problem comes in you shudder. It\xe2\x80\x99s an escape, escape from reality. Say the reality is in this room, if you run away from this room, this way or that way, you are running away from reality. I would say, after war, so many people died, perhaps, perhaps, who were dissatisfied souls and in a very bad condition. Hitler was a satan, real satan, and all these forces were let loose later on by these gurus or whatever it is, and they captured you, perhaps, that you took to these things. These are extremely injurious to our being.\n\nI went once to Trichu. They had invited Me and all these people came in big cars to receive Me, I was quite surprised that seldom \xe2\x80\x93 Sahaja Yogis are never very well-off people I mean, to that extent that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have cars after cars. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat business do you do all of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, actually we are all people growing tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd I said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery nice.\xe2\x80\x9d They are growing now, you see, not only eating but growing also. And I said\xe2\x80\xa6 In their houses you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised, they had tiles made in England, they had taps made in England. All these ancient things that you have had which you treat as antiques today, they all had everything with them made in England [laughter]. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMade in England. How do you get all these things in here?\xe2\x80\x9d The things you do not have here they had it there. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are exporting tobacco to England.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery nice, what a nice work you are doing, exporting tobacco to England.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it is sinful to do like this? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know as Indians that tobacco is against religion?\xe2\x80\x9d He says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe know but we don\xe2\x80\x99t take. And if you give it to others [laughter], then it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a person who owns all the race course says, \xe2\x80\x9cI never see. I never put my money on a horse. I just collect. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a race course.\xe2\x80\x9d That sort of a person, that sort of a, attitude they had. So I said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery nice. You are exporting all your tobacco to England.\xe2\x80\x9d I told them, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do it. You are very near the sea, and sea is the guru, he will teach you a lesson of the worst type. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you today, now it is in the attention of the sea. Believe Me. Remove this. Do not send any tobacco. Do not grow, you can \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should we grow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can grow very good cotton\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThere were three-four people who took Me seriously. They said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Mother, we will grow cotton.\xe2\x80\x9d And they really started making a big money because they produced very long threads, just like Egyptian cotton they started doing. The rest of them didn\xe2\x80\x99t like Me. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t thank Me, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to see Me off at the station \xe2\x80\x93 all their cars were just fizzled out. I thought I had to take a taxi to go the station now [laughter, She laughs].\n\nBut can you imagine, within one year\xe2\x80\x99s time, there was a typhoon. And there was another thing going on. These people were exporting this to England, and selling tobacco, the\xe2\x80\xa6 you see the cheap type tobacco, you see whatever are the remains, the molasses you can call it, they were selling it to the poor people; and poor people were taking that very concentrated, eating that. So they took to black magic spiritualism. All of them were doing black magic. In their small little huts they were sitting doing black magic \xe2\x80\x93 can you imagine? \xe2\x80\x93 in their villages doing black magic. And the sea got so angry with the typhoon. You might have heard about the big floods in that area.\n\nI must warn Brighton people [laughter]. The sea is taking a respite now, you just see that, because you are insulting the sea, all the time you are insulting him. This holiday-making now \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a disease with the western people. Holiday. There\xe2\x80\x99s a girl in Sahaja Yoga, her sister also comes sometime, she was to have a baby, she is a lady doctor, sister \xe2\x80\x93 she has gone for a holiday, without any heart. She had a caesarean, can you imagine? All the Sahaja Yogis putting all their attention to the birth of the child, and this lady has very nicely gone for a holiday because holiday she must have. You see without holiday, she is nowhere. It\xe2\x80\x99s all programmed; you must go for a holiday. What have you achieved by going to holidays I would like to know, what wisdoms? Except for sitting in the sun, getting a skin disease, and a skin cancer for Me to cure. What is the need to go in the sun such a lot I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What are you achieving?\n\nYour healths are going from bad to worse. Your forefathers had much better health than you people have. Despite all these health things you are doing, what is your health? Your livers are out. If you\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s nice, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy the sun is coming, now you\xe2\x80\x99ll give up your alcohol. Let the sun scorch you, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll give up your alcohol. Otherwise you will not. Here, you go in the sun, sit there, take all the alcohols there, drink all wine \xe2\x80\x93 in the presence of the sea. No wonder all these oil tankers are breaking there and spoiling your health resorts.\n\nThat will happen.\n\nYou have no consideration for the sea is there, is your guru and you are drinking like mad. Nude women sitting down there tanning themselves. What\xe2\x80\x99s this nonsense going on? I mean I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what is the need to tan your body like this? Who has told you that you look beautiful? You look ghastly with that. I really tell you, you look ghastly. Here you are discriminating on racial points [laughter], saying that people are dark, why are you darkening yourself I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, what is the wisdom [laughter, She laughs]? You know going to the other extreme. All right, once in a while you sit in the sun, do something, is all right.\n\nBut what is the need for you to be so extremely concerned about your holidaying, and in the holiday drink, fight with wife, come back and have a divorce. Always after a holiday, the after-effects of the alcohol you can see very clearly. In India, thank God we do not go out for holidays at all, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in holidaying, at all! At the most if you have to go somewhere, we go to some festival or to somebody\xe2\x80\x99s marriage or something; if there is an occasion only then we move out of the houses, we are gruhasthas, we settle in the family, gruhasthas who stays in the gruha, householders. We are not like vagabond gypsies all the time moving about. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right once in a while, just to enjoy a picnic or something. I mean you are not scouts all your life. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s so maddening, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. My husband\xe2\x80\x99s office there are two great executives, British, they cycle down to the office. It looks so odd, you know, with half-pants [laughter]. With such a big office, how will it look, two half-pant people coming down, with a half-pant and perspiring and smelling and everything. It is absurd! [Laughter]\n\nBut there is something behind this all-frantic effort, is you are seeking something. Some people think that by going to holidays you will achieve something. I mean music, what have you achieved in music now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. By going to these holidays, if you have achieved this kind of music which shatters every part of your skin, I mean when I hear it, you know, the whole vibrations go on, jamming into it (?).\n\nAnd your bad livers, think of that at least, bad livers, your skin diseases, your skin cancers. All this in the presence of the guru, the sea. Can you imagine? There is no auspiciousness in this, you do not understand.\n\nThe sea is to be worshipped. It\xe2\x80\x99s a temple. It teaches you, it has given you such a lot. Think of the sea, what it has given you. Without the sea, what would have been your condition? In England specially. It taught you challenge, it gave you ideas how to go abroad, it has given you such a lot. All your wealth comes from sea and what are you doing about your Lakshmi? And do you know, the Lakshmi Tattwa which resides in the centre, is born out of the sea. Actually he is your grandfather. Do you have any respect for him? So much to learn, from the sea, from the guru. It never leaves its boundaries. It keeps to that. If you try to press the sea from one side it will show on the other side, somewhere. Such a huge thing, it gets all the water from all over the world, but it keeps its boundaries. It never crosses it, unless and until you press it.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the sign of a magnanimous great personality: it keeps its boundaries - I mean, so far and not that - The dignity of it is - I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a word like maryada in English language - is the boundaries of decency and decorum.\n\nThen it gives you the rain. It gives you the basis of your food. Sea is the father. And where do they meet, really in the most beautiful way, the sea and the Mother Earth? They meet at the Sahastrara on the Himalayas where all the clouds freeze and cover completely the Mother Earth, where there is snow all over, on the Alps. It\xe2\x80\x99s complete purity.\n\nThese are too subtle things for people who are not seeking, but I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to seekers. You have to be subtler people to understand the beauty of the sea, its poetry of a guru. When it roars, you see, the roaring of the sea challenges you: \xe2\x80\x9cCome up my child, come up my disciple, come up, come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo Me sea is like a father. I\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled by sea so much, so much. And anytime I have traveled it has carried Me like a very gentle mother. Never a bad weather, such a nice weather. Always. It\xe2\x80\x99s so kind, it\xe2\x80\x99s so kind to Me. Once I was coming from Japan and they said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are typhoons coming.\xe2\x80\x9d Five typhoons were coming. They never touched My ship. Nowhere. People were amazed. And we were coming to Bombay from Colombo, when we turned round it was monsoon. They said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow.\xe2\x80\x9d The captain was quite amazed, you see. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut now, you cannot help it. The wind will go in the other direction and we are going to have a bad time.\xe2\x80\x9d But what a smooth lake, just like a mirror, beautiful! Just like a gentle mother. It carried Me on its sari I felt. So beautiful.\n\nAnd such a sea you insult, because you are ignorant, because you are blind. I wish the sea forgives you, but gurus do not forgive easily. Mother is different. Gurus are hard taskmasters, you see. They normally do not forgive you.\n\nNow you have heard about Ravi Shankar who is a great musician who plays sitar. I know when he was studying in - he was in the beginning a student of Allauddin Khasa. Allauddin Khasa was a Realized soul, a great man, a genius, a genius he was. Absolutely a real guru, you should say. He never drank. And he was a Muslim but a worshipper of Kali, you see, and all that. And he used to call Me \xe2\x80\x9cMa.\xe2\x80\x9d Mother.\n\nI was with My father who was the political adviser to that State, Maihar [Madhya Pradesh]. I mean you could see he was really so subtle in everything! And he used to play that big drum which he said the best is produced in Maihar, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he settled down there, what we call is the \xe2\x80\x9cpakhawaj\xe2\x80\x9d is the very big drum, you see.\n\nHe used to play tremendously. He used to just go on into such echoes and beautiful rendering. And he was a master of so many things like sarod \xe2\x80\x93 his son himself is Ali Akbar Khan Sahib. His daughter Annapurna is a great singer and all that.\n\nAnd I remember Allauddin, when we went there, he used to respect My father very much and - also because My father was a great connoisseur of music and a Realized soul himself, a great man.\n\nSo, once he was going to play the pakhawaj and Ravi Shankar was also sitting there you see, hiding his face on the sides. So when he had played his pakhawaj, My father said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you also play some sitar to me, I would like to see how much you have learned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, sir, not today, not today.\xe2\x80\x9d So then he went inside, for something \xe2\x80\x93 the guru.\n\nHe [Ravi] said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee, are you going to see here something?\xe2\x80\x9d He [father] said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBig lump, you see, was here\xe2\x80\x9d, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has broken my sitar on my head today because I played two notes wrongly. See sir.\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter]\n\nThat was the thing. The gurus are very, very, strict people, they have to be. And the way they used to treat the disciples. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like this. The gurus you know are the gurus who are trying to pamper your ego. Why? Because they want your purse. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to enlighten you. They say, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, what, you drink? All right, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I can give you more. Whatever you want I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you. Just pass the purse this side, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Why do you want to have these, metal, this\xe2\x80\xa6 some metal-like, metallic things like a, say a Rolls Royce? What\xe2\x80\x99s the use, this metal thing? You pass it over to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look after it. What is the need for you to have possessed this grand palace? Pass it over to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look after \xe2\x80\x93 you must give up everything for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll enlighten you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven if you may have palaces and anything, the real guru will not look at your face. He never hankers after people, never. That\xe2\x80\x99s the sign of a real guru: that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hanker after you: \xe2\x80\x9cCome along to me, come along to me. All right, how many people are coming? Now have an organization and run a big mission about it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then the people are coming and write your names and you become the members of the society and all that.\n\nA real guru will sit in some odd place, where you have to go seven miles up, walking, falling, somewhere hidden, and there you go and you find he\xe2\x80\x99s not there. [Laughter]You break your legs on the way.\n\n[Shri Mataji laughs, laughter]\n\nBut they know so many things. According to them, you are not to be treated that kindly. And they tell Me that \xe2\x80\x9cMother, what is Your whim?\xe2\x80\x9d. And \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. For us, we had to work so hard to get these vibrations.\xe2\x80\x9d One gentleman has told that: \xe2\x80\x9cI was a frog. Since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeking. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent how many years I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, so many thousand years to get vibrations, while Mother has just given you like this! What is your speciality? Are you going to give your life for Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d And all sort of questions. [She laughs]\n\nSo I asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you tell them? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want their life. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of their life? I want their Spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut why these?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you jealous?\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter]\n\nThey say that \xe2\x80\x9cMother, You carry on with them. We can\xe2\x80\x99t face this, human beings are horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d And I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you that I asked one person to go to America, he ran away, within two days. Within two days. He would not face Americans \xe2\x80\x93 the real ones. The unreal ones are very nice, you see. There\xe2\x80\x99s mutual understanding going on.\n\nSo these hard taskmasters are so beautiful. From outside they look so harsh. Inside, they are so beautiful. You must know how to please them.\n\nFor example, I went to see one guru once and all the boys were against it. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in any guru, why are you going to see?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in any guru, who told you? I believe in all the gurus. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the agurus.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see the vibrations.\xe2\x80\x9d We had to climb up and this and that, and we went down there. And it was raining heavily, very heavily. And the guru was very angry he was sitting there, because he could control water, I told you. He could control rain, you know. So when I went up he was doing like this, very angry. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even look at Me. I went and sat down, all drenched in water with that rain.\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did You not allow me to stop the rain, is it because of my ego that You wanted to punish me? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want You to get drenched when You are coming to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d What a great thing. I mean he talked to Me as if he knew Me, you see, the way he talked. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot even my gurus and gurus never had such an opportunity that You are coming to see me, and I was just prepared here, and here You are coming all drenched. What a shame for me I could not control this rain. It\xe2\x80\x99s all Your doing Mother, why did You do it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cShould I tell you why I did it?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, you have bought a sari for Me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And I would not take a sari from a sanyasi; but if I get drenched, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take.\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter]\n\nThe whole thing melted away. The whole thing, the whole temper, everything melted away. It was so sweet, you know, so sweet. There was an artist with Me, who has done the painting. So beautiful, showing the love, you see. He just fell at My Feet. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, people have praised You. What words should I use to praise You?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Your sari, you bring it for Me. First of all, I must wear your sari, I\xe2\x80\x99m all drenched.\xe2\x80\x9d So happy. It\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful the whole thing. This is what it is.\n\nYou all have to be the gurus. I know, first thing you learn is to be very, great hard taskmasters, to begin with. That you should not do. You have to be hard taskmaster with yourself. And then, as your Mother, Who is your Guru, is very sweet and tolerant, very kind, extremely patient. You have to deal with people like that. Because we are not dealing with people who are seekers of that quality, who will do anything to get to God. We are dealing with people who are confused, absolutely confused. They are saints, but they are confused. See, people come to our program, disappear. They\xe2\x80\x99ll get their Realization and disappear. Then you have to give them bandhans, this thing. You see, they are still confused. And there are so many gurus who are acting, there are so many things that are happening, so we cannot be aggressive with them. We have to be very patient, and we have to think about our past, how we came to Mother, how She had to convince us, how much we argued with Her, what all we did. So these people are coming, let us try to be kind to them and talk to them, and tell in a way which is congenial, which is beautiful.\n\nNot like those gurus because they had only one guru, and one disciple, do you know that? The relationship was only one plus one. And that one also used to come down, many-a-times. Like one person I know, whom I met, he\xe2\x80\x99s told Me, \xe2\x80\x9cI have only one disciple and I\xe2\x80\x99ve given him up. He\xe2\x80\x99s thrown in the sea, he\xe2\x80\x99s useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI trained him up for twenty-five years and he\xe2\x80\x99s a good-for-nothing fellow. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s having a nice time, earning money. He\xe2\x80\x99s a Realized soul, just imagine. And he\xe2\x80\x99s having a nice time and he\xe2\x80\x99s making money out of it. This is the last story I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d He told Me his name, this Maharaj. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd when this fellow came in Bombay, one lady telephoned to Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, you wanted to meet this Maharaji, he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI went down to see him, he was smoking cigarettes like this, sitting like this. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Mataji has come, very nice\xe2\x80\x9d and all that.\n\nHe, of course, I mean he touched My feet like this, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d And there were ladies pressing his feet and all that and he was talking to them very\xe2\x80\xa6 trying to show lot of arrogance in My presence. I was just looking at him.\n\nThen he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh. So, my guru comes to see You in Bombay. Why is he leaving his place? Why should he do this?\xe2\x80\x9d. And all sorts of thing he was talking, against his guru.\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, now I\xe2\x80\x99m going, but I will put some sindoor on your head, just to put a tilak on your head,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. So I took some sindoor, put it on his head; Agnya Chakra I moved it. Then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow you put.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen he start put\xe2\x80\xa6 I sucked his hand, you see completely, and he started, \xe2\x80\x9cAhee-hee-hee-hee-hee he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, Mother what are You doing, what are You doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I doing? Will you please take back all the words you have said about your guru? You have no shame. Twenty-five years that man worked on you and you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing all the shame here. Will you remove your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t! What are You doing to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cUnless and until you promise that you will not say a word against your guru and hold your ears, with the another hand, or with your legs [She laughs], then only I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter) He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, You will drop\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow the others didn\xe2\x80\x99t see all this conversation, you see, they just saw his shaking, you see. When I went away he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, how powerful I am? See.\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter] Fools as they were, they never realized that he was shaking, and what shaking means, you see? And he made such a fool out of them. He took from everyone, one and a quarter tola [ed: tola is an old Indian weight equal to 180 grains, 0.375 troy ounces.] gold, you see, as a dakshina, guru dakshina, and said that \xe2\x80\x9cSee, even Mataji \xe2\x80\x93 I was getting all Her powers into me, sucking all Her Powers into me.\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter] And these fools believed him, you see. And then one of them met Me at the airport and she told Me that \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s taken away so much money from us. That day only he made us pay for one and a quarter tola gold for the guru dakshina.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him one day, again.\xe2\x80\x9d But all of them were doomed like that. So, this is what it is. And he\xe2\x80\x99s so attractive to people, you know. And then he was sitting on a very big thing and the thousands are approaching him, there. But then I did some arrangements. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s all right, in the jail, direct [laughter]. In the jail, direct. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\n\nBut we had one Sahaj Yogini like this. She got her Realization and I told her, \xe2\x80\x9cYour guru was no good and you don\xe2\x80\x99t take anything from him, because he\xe2\x80\x99ll try to give you some siddhis and you will try to impress people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no Mother, I want the parama, I want the last, the absolute, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want all that.\xe2\x80\x9d Because her guru used to carry some snakes around and do all kinds of tricks you see, go into tantrums.\n\nWhen I went to America, I heard about her, that she\xe2\x80\x99s having three thousand disciples; I never had them in Bombay that time. I used to hardly get about two hundred people somehow or other sticking on to this\xe2\x80\xa6 thing.\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cThree thousand. What is she doing?\xe2\x80\x9d I got really worried you know; I put her into bandhan and everything.\n\nBut when I came back, you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe, she had silver water carriers you see, these pitchers, she brought to wash My Feet and this. I was so embarrassed, so embarrassed. And she showed Me, \xe2\x80\x9cSee Mother, what work I\xe2\x80\x99m doing.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a big photograph of Mine there, put, and all the bhoots around. I could see all them hovering, you see, all of them. [Laughter]\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she doing? What work has she been doing and what is she up to? Because she\xe2\x80\x99s completely gone darkened and haunted.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing with these people?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Mother, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spread Your name there. I can even tell people if they have lost their property somewhere, wherever is the hidden money, or I tell so many things\xe2\x80\xa6. I can even tell the name of the horse which is going to come first.\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter] I said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery nice. What a nice Sahaj Yoga is going on here,\xe2\x80\x9d you see? So I told her, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you come and see Me tomorrow at home.\xe2\x80\x9d She came down. I had two-three people sitting, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, tell about them.\xe2\x80\x9d She said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou live near a bridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, never, I live near a sea. How can you bridge a sea?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she said this, that. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen she told another lady. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThird person said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing, this is not true. You are just telling something that is not true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo she rushed to Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, have You taken away all my powers?\xe2\x80\x9d [Laughter]\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf they were your powers I would have made you sit here. These are the powers of the devil. What interest God has got to tell that \xe2\x80\x98What is the horse coming,\xe2\x80\x99 and all that? [Laughter] Why should you tell all these things? These are not your powers, these are the powers of the spirits which are haunting you, and which you have captured, and your guru is doing all this job.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God, I never knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is that. All right, say that \xe2\x80\x98I give up. I give up.\xe2\x80\x99 Say it thrice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Mother. I want the parama, I want the absolute\xe2\x80\x9d. She went home, but you know this popularity, this cheap popularity, is a very enticing thing. She again carried on, and now she is in the lunatic asylum. This is what it is. Because these spirits which help you, come back on you and torture you.\n\nSo all those people who try to deviate, even after Realization, are corrected by the principle of guru only. With the principle of Agnya, you give Realization, enlightenment. With the principle of Sahastrara you give integration, but with the principle of guru you give them dharma. That\xe2\x80\x99s why so many people, all of you who came to Me, have very easily given up all these habits, because you have found the Spirit, the joy. And then you don\xe2\x80\x99t want all that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you that you have to give up, you just give up, you just forget it, because your attention is now attached to your Spirit.\n\nThat is the job of a guru. It is said that: \xe2\x80\x9cGuru is that which makes you meet the Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d Means: \xe2\x80\x9cmakes you meet the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s the guru. Otherwise all these are not gurus. But the one who has not even settled your dharmas, who does not have his own dharmas, how can you accept them as gurus?\n\nMay God bless you all.\n\n[Start of 3: informal talk to seekers]\n\nShri Mataji [about a young child]: This is a born Realized child. [Shri Mataji laughs]\n\nHello, how are you? Hum, what are they catching? He is showing from his feet. All over right side Sahastrara.\n\nRight side Sahastrara means what? Superego. It comes to the right [of the brain]. All feeling the heaviness on the right side, the little child is showing.\n\nThey are working, they are busy all the time. All the time they are busy. Gavin\xe2\x80\x99s child\xe2\x80\x99s such a little thing\xe2\x80\xa6 all the time. [Laughter, She laughs] Trying to clear you out \xe2\x80\x93 great people they are. All the time they are working. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I want you all to get married soon, with so many great children are to be born to you.\n\nAll right, I can make it cool for you, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nYou have to think of the Moon who is your maternal uncle. He was born with Lakshmi. There are fourteen things that were born from the sea. One of them is also a hunter. The stick Gregoire gave Me yesterday was also, came out of the sea. That was the fourteenth thing.\n\nBetter now?\n\nNow, those who have come for the first time should come forward, you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s better in the forward line somewhere, would be better and the second line could be - it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. These people have come for the first time, all of you?\n\nAll right, can you come on these first three lines, all right. Now who else is there? Please, come forward.\n\nAs you know, Sahaja Yoga is a very subtle thing and the main thing is it must work, it must actualize, the Kundalini must rise. You must get your Realization, that\xe2\x80\x99s the main concern is. Whatever you may say, whatever your arguments may be or any problems may be, we are not bothered about that. What we are bothered about: that you should meet yourself. That\xe2\x80\x99s the main point we are at, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to achieve.\n\nNow the problems arise out of our imbalances in life and so many things. Whatever it is, still, the force is so great, that you will get your Realization. Why I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you? That I find people, once they get their Realization, they think it\xe2\x80\x99s done now, we are happy, then they don\xe2\x80\x99t come. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the germination has taken place, the Kundalini has shot off, because She\xe2\x80\x99s been waiting all these days, you see, so the whole thing comes up as a big experience.\n\nBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you have established it.\n\nSo the second thing you have to do is to establish, that\xe2\x80\x99s very important. Much more important than getting Realization I feel, because the Realization, if it takes place and it falls down, then what\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\n\nSo you take your Realization, which you\xe2\x80\x99ll get, no doubt about it, because you all look that way. But, then you must have self-esteem and understand that you have got it because you deserved it. Some people haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it in India who have been with Me for seven years, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. That I can see clearly, you are all going to get it. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean if you get it, that you again waste it, because this is what you have been seeking all your lives.\n\nBecause in the West the problem is: though such saints are born, they have this rambling of the brain and they start thinking. You do not get it through your rationality. You get it through your Kundalini, which you cannot think about. So you allow it to grow, manifest itself, and you become as good as others are.\n\nNow they are all experts and gurus, you know, they know such a lot about Kundalini. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed, they are all experts, they look just like you! They are raising Kundalini, they are giving Realization, they know everything about it.\n\nSo in the same way, you have to be. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple thing which takes place at any age, any time, any race, anything. The main thing is that you must have self-esteem, you must know that you are saints. You have been saints for years and you have been ages like this. You have been seeking and seeking and seeking. Now when you have found it, you allow it to grow, because it\xe2\x80\x99s very important, and you must know your value. That is important. Because I value you, because I see something much deeper that you can\xe2\x80\x99t see. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that, gradually you\xe2\x80\x99ll start seeing, all right? On this promise, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you Realization.\n\nPut your hands like this. Put both the feet on the ground, straight. Sometimes I find, you see I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very hard on people and they get lost, I feel very sorry for that.\n\nLeft Swadisthana, you see [She laughs] \xe2\x80\x93 give him\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nLike a saint he\xe2\x80\x99s sitting here, great guru. [About a child]\n\nNow put your hands towards Me, like this, and close your eyes.\n\nPlease close your eyes.\n\nNow what happens is that first you become thoughtlessly aware, nirvichar samadhi. Samadhi means enlightened awareness. You get enlightened awareness which is thoughtless. You become thoughtlessly aware. First.\n\nAnd in the second happening, when it crosses the Agnya it happens to you, and when it crosses, pierces through this point called as taloo, the fontanel bone area, you start feeling the radiation of your Spirit in your hands, like vibrations.\n\nAre you feeling the cool breeze in your hands? Already you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it!\n\nYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little problem. All right, watch Me here, little bit. There? Hm. Without thinking, just watch Me, it will work out.\n\nWhatever I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, you forget it. You see, if you have taken drugs doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I can drink all that; just suck it out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about all these things, forget, have no guilt of any kind, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking of Ocean of Love which is ocean. What guilt can you have? Just a speck. So please, do not have any guilt, on the contrary say to Me that \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we are not guilty \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m not guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d In your heart, just say that. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only catching point in you.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fashion also, these days, to feel guilty about anything. Now close your eyes. Please close your eyes. Know that you are not guilty at all, that you are very beautiful.\n\nRight to the left. Move right to the \xe2\x80\x93 keep your eyes\xe2\x80\xa6. are you feeling? It will work out. Just let it be, let it be, you see, let it go, let it go. Close your eyes. You must get it. Not to get upset with yourself. Are you criticizing yourself? Are you?\n\nSeeker: Just frightened.\n\nShri Mataji: Eh?\n\nSeeker: Just frightened.\n\nYogis: Frightened.\n\nShri Mataji: Frightened, about what? About the beauty that you have? Not to be frightened at all. Nothing to be frightened. Do I look frightful?\n\nSeeker: Nothing.\n\nShri Mataji: Ha?\n\nSeeker: Nothing.\n\nShri Mataji: All right. Now close, close your eyes.\n\nNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be frightened, it\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest thing that can happen, absolutely it is there, it\xe2\x80\x99s like the germination of a seed. Just close your eyes, nothing to be frightened. Just let it go, let it go, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Is the simplest thing.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Just like that.\n\nYou have to be frightened of pubs and things like that, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99m really frightened of pubs.\n\nRight to the left. Move (?) left to the right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s feel his vibrations, come along. Some of you come along. No, at the back.\n\nJust sit down, sit down. They\xe2\x80\x99ll just work it out. Close your eyes, close your eyes, they are just helping you out, just close your eyes. Just - you see, it is like, they know the swimming and they are just trying to help you. Once you are on the shore, they\xe2\x80\x99ll also teach you how to swim and then you are going to save others.\n\nHm. Work on him.\n\nClose your eyes, don\xe2\x80\x99t think about it. Just enjoy, this is the greatest thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it.\n\nSahastrara, right. No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99ll work out, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry, we know your problem. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t - close your eyes. We know your problem.\n\nRight to the left. We know your problem, we know everything where that\xe2\x80\x99s happening. Just close your eyes. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be frightened, I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen?\n\nSomebody is frightening you inside. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, I must say. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be frightened.\n\nSakshat Moksha Dayini, Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini.
