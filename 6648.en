I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it, nor can we change it. We cannot know it by reading books or by listening to lectures. And you cannot pay for it. At this human awareness unfortunately you cannot know it.

All our civilization is like a tree but if we do not know our roots all this civilization will get undernourished and may be destroyed. But if we know our roots then we can take to our growth in spirituality. This growth has to start within us. You are all spiritual beings - you all divinity within yourself. You have not yet touched it but this is very easy - sahaja - for you to get to your roots. To go to your roots you have to become a subtle being.

You have become from amoeba to this state as a human being but now you have not reached that absolute state. That is why there are quarrels and different ideologies. So you have to become the Spirit for which already in you is placed this miraculous instrument. It is all there within you, built-in. Like these lights, you have many lights but you have to put on only one switch to get all these lights on. But if I am to tell you that this electricity was discovered and then it was brought here in Moscow and put here it's quite a boring thing and of no use.

So the best thing is for you to get your Self-realisation, to get your state of Spirit then in that light you will understand everything very well. It is a very subtle subject. If you become the Spirit then the light of that Spirit enlightens you completely. First you discover what's wrong with you. These are the resurrection times and for that you have to know what are your problems within yourself.

So when this power of kundalini - which connects you to this all-pervading Power - comes through your fontanel bone area then you start feeling this all-pervading subtle Power which you have never felt before. It is the power of divine love and it starts flowing through you. As this instrument is to be connected to the mains, our instrument has to be connected to this all-pervading Power through our Spirit.

So when the kundalini rises she passes through six subtle centres and gives you such energy that you solve your physical, mental and emotional problems completely. Somehow I think Russians are extremely sensitive to spirituality. Except for here I have not seen anywhere in the world such sensitivity as you people have. You are really special people. You here are so fast to spirituality that it is amazing.

So first thing happens with you that you start feeling the cool breeze on your fingertips of the Holy Ghost, you can call it. In the Bible they have not described the Christ's mother as Madonna at all. On the contrary, they say that women are second class citizens and that the mother of Christ was not at the supper table so she was not an apostle. This is no logic because Paul was nowhere near Christ but still the whole religion is taken out of Paul. And they are giving artificial baptism. Baptism is a reality. When the kundalini rises she actually breaks through your fontanel bone area and you get actualization of the baptism. You cannot organize religion, you cannot organize God. You cannot take money in the name of God.

So when you become the Spirit you get the powers of the Spirit. Many people take false certificates saying that, "You are born again." But if you are born again then you must have the powers of the Spirit.

The first power of the Spirit is that your attention gets enlightened. That means wherever you pay attention it acts. Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes." - to that extend he went to morality. So as a result of kundalini rising your eyes become innocent, without any lust and greed in them; and they become very powerful with compassion. Even a glance of such a person can manifest curative powers. It can also manifest peace, joy.

This attention acts: sitting down here you can find out about anything you want to know. You have just to put your hands like this and think of the person - immediately your fingers start showing you what centres that person is catching. So the first power you have is of collective consciousness. You get self-knowledge - you know about your own centres, and you know the centres of others also.

Now, if you know how to correct these centres you are perfectly alright. Either you go to the left or to the right, left sympathetic or right sympathetic, that is to the part or to the future. You cannot be in the present. With the rising of the Kundalini the thoughts on the past and future just stop and you stand in the present. It's completely silent time. This is the power you develop called as "thoughtless awareness" for which you have to forgive everyone. Forgiveness, that is very important because the kundalini passes through this Agnya chakra which is like this - closed absolutely. And if you do not forgive then it will not open; you have to forgive so it will open.

So now, in our evolutionary process - which is a living process - we have to just get to this breakthrough. Like these flowers you see, they come from this seed - you take them granted. The same our eyes - we take them for granted - they are micro-cameras. Who does all this? It's all done by this living power of love. It's the most powerful thing, this love.

So the second state when you reach - it is called as "doubtless awareness". Like you sow a seed in the Mother Earth: it sprouts by itself, sahaja - spontaneously. So the seed has got the power to sprout built-in and the Mother Earth has got the power also. In the same way, you too have the built-in power to become the Spirit. But you must have full faith in yourself that all of you can get your realisation. And then you have to grow into it.

Second thing happens that the Spirit is not only the collective being but also it's the source of absolute truth. Like if you have ten children who are realized souls, you tie their eyes and put somebody before them, they will all raise one finger like this. So you ask the man, "What's wrong with you? Have you got a throat trouble?" So he’ll say, "How do you know?" So this finger shows the throat.

There are many false people who have come, from my country also, and who are trying to make money in the name of God. And you can also find out very easily what is false and what is true on your fingertips.

Also whatever religion you may follow - Hindi, Christian, Muslim, any religion - you can commit any sin. That means it is artificial, it's not real. So what is reality is within ourselves. This religion has to be awaken. So you really become saintly, really. Nobody has to tell you, "Don't do this, don't do that." It's so simple. So you know the absolute truth. But you enter into the ocean of joy. Nothing can disturb you. If you see the Sahaja Yogis, they blossom like flowers. When they mature they never quarrel, never cry, no jealousy, no catching.

Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations. They are many who are against because they don't like truth and they are making money so they don't like me telling them, "You can't take money."

Now we have to know that all our human problems come from us only. So only thing what we need is transformation of human beings so all our problems can be solved. And such powerful person can transform the whole world so there is such an emancipation of human beings.

I’ve always felt this great love for Russians and I think they are going to be the most powerful country one day, spiritually. But you have to have patience with yourself, first of all. Sahaja Yoga works collectively. Formerly people used to go to Himalayas and do all cleansing for ages together; work very hard, fast and sometimes die also. But in Sahaja Yoga you don't have to give up anything. You don't have to give up your family, anything. But then cleansing comes through because of the collective feeling. Like this mine, one nail is broken then it will never grow. And now you have become microcosm into macrocosm. You have become a drop into the ocean. So only in collectivity you will grow in Sahaja Yoga otherwise your weaknesses will overpower you. So all those who keep to collectivity will grow very fast.

In a place like Tolyatti we have so many Sahaja Yogis - 14 000, they are absolutely collective. And they know even if they got all their sicknesses, all their problems and they are absolutely enjoying themselves. I want also Moscow to be able to enjoy themselves.

Today they have informed me that we have to leave the hall little earlier because the military might come at ten o'clock. So today I will not ask you to ask me questions. I know how to answer all the questions but by that you are not going to get your realisation. It's all mental acrobatics. There is no guarantee that you will get realisation by asking questions. But you have to have pure desire in your heart to get realisation. If you have that pure desire then there is no problem at all.

As scientists whatever I have told you should be taken with an open mind. There is another beautiful world waiting for us. And if it is - like a hypothesis you are going to do - if it is proved you have to accept it as honest people. As honest people you have to accept there is possibility because these are resurrection times, very important times. Because it is for the benevolence for the whole world. And especially, you people, are so divine within yourself.

If you have any question you may write and bring it to these people and maybe I will send you the answer. If you are sick or there is problem of sickness, we are a clinic here where you can go and get yourself cured.

So now we'll have the session for our realisation. I hope you all agree.

At the very outset I have to say that I cannot force Self-realisation on you. You have to ask for it because I respect your freedom. And after becoming the Spirit you become absolutely free. In no way I cannot force on you Self-realisation.

There are three conditions of course. The first condition is that you have to have full faith in yourself that you will all get your realisation. Second condition is that you have to forget your past; that is, you are not to feel guilty at all. You have done nothing wrong which cannot be forgiven by this divine power. Do not believe that you are sinners and all this nonsense that we take money. You are human beings and with a little breakthrough more you are the epitome of the evolution. But if you feel guilty then you catch this centre here - on the left side - very badly and then you develop horrible diseases like angina, spondylitis and other diseases due to lethargic organs. Also Kundalini won't rise. So do not have this kind of a mental conception about yourself; don't try to condemn yourself at all.

The third one is very difficult: is to forgive everyone without thinking about whom you have to forgive but in general. You have to forgive in general: you have to forgive everyone. Because logically whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything, isn’t it? It’s very important. It's just your mental idea. But when you do not forgive you torture yourself. So those who really have troubled you are happy and you are torturing yourself. Just now if you say, "I forgive everyone." you will feel very, very light in your head. The worst thing is that you are torturing yourself and you will not get your realisation. So we have to respect ourselves. And why should we torture ourselves for nothing at all. It is very important that you all should forgive everyone. Please do it.

Alright. So these are the three conditions for you.

Now, to take the help from the Mother Earth those who are sitting up there should take out their shoes and those who are sitting down also should take out their shoes. You must be comfortable, not bending too much or bending back but be straight, comfortably. Sahaja Yoga is a very comfortable happening.

Now you have to, those who are sitting on those seats have to put their feet away from each other because they are two powers, left and right. But those who are sitting on the ground are alright. We have two powers, one is the left, another is the right. The second one is the one which gives the balance.

So now left side is the power of desire. So please put your left hand toward me - like this on your lap, comfortably - expressing that you want your Self-realisation. And those who do not want to have Self-realisation should leave the hall, be civil, because it cannot be forced.

So now, put the left hand towards me like this. First we'll show you what is to be done and then we'll close our eyes and go into meditation. Now, the right hand we put on our heart. In the heart is reflected the Spirit, resides the Spirit. If the Spirit shines in your attention then you become wise and your own guide, your own master. So now please take down your hand on the left hand side of your abdomen on the upper portion. This is the centre of your mastery. We are only working on the left side. Now you take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of pure knowledge which works on your central nervous system and you know all about divinity. You have to feel this all-pervading Power on your central nervous system. That is called as "bodha" from where the word "buddha" has come, "vida" from where the word "veda" has come, means "knowing on your central nervous system". So whatever you get of evolution you know it on the central nervous system. Now raise your right hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, again on your heart please, now in the corner of your neck and shoulder. And now turn your head to your right. I told you, this centre you catch because you feel guilty. Now please put your right hand on top of your forehead, across like this and bend your head as far as possible. Here is the centre where you have to forgive everyone in general. Now take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading Power. Now you have to stretch your palm fully. And now put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now put down your head. But here push back your fingers; it's very important to put a big pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp slowly clockwise seven times. That's all we have to do.

Now again, if you have anything tight on your waist or on your neck then loosen it. Now please put the left hand towards me and put the right hand on your heart. Now here you have to close your eyes till I tell you, please don't open. Take out your spectacles also. Here you have to ask me a very fundamental question three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" You can call me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji".

Now you have to put your right hand on the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side and here again you have to ask another fundamental question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. But now you have to take down your hand on the left hand side of your abdomen, on the lower part and here you have to ask six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge." because this centre has got six petals.

As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising so we have to nourish the upper centres so please take your right hand and put it on the upper portion of your abdomen and here you have to say twelve times, "Mother, I am my own master." You have to nourish it with full confidence.

I've already told you at the very outset that you are the pure Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this mental, nor this ego but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and with full confidence say twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

The all-pervading divine power is the power of love and compassion; it is the power of the ocean of your knowledge but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed this power can dissolve that. So raise your hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and say with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." sixteen times. Turn your head to your right.

I've already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So you have to forgive because the centre won't open. So please remember that it is very important that you have to forgive each and every person without thinking about them. So now raise your hand to your forehead and put it down, your head, as far as possible. Here you have to say with full confidence, not how many times but from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes you have to say for your own satisfaction, "Oh, divine power, if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me." So take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible and here you have to say again with love - not how many times but with all your heart that, "Oh, divine power, if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me."

Now please stretch your palm and put the centre of your palm on the fontanel bone area. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom so please move your scalp seven times with full pressure and say seven times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." Push back your fingers then it will happen. Push back your fingers, put a good pressure.

Now bring down your hand and open your eyes. Please put both the hands towards me like this and watch me without thinking. Now put the right hand towards me like this, put down your head and see for yourself with the left hand if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Bend your head. Please don't put your hand on the head but away from it. Bend your head.

Now put the left hand towards me and again see for yourself with the right hand. Those who have not forgiven will not feel the cool breeze but hot breeze. So please forgive, even now. Now please put the left hand towards me. Again bend your head and see with the right hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this, push back your head and ask one of these questions, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or "Mother, is this the power of divine love?" or "Mother, is this the paramchaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions three times.

Now put down your hands. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze out of their fingers or on their hands, or out of the fontanel bone area please raise both your hands.

You all have got it. I bow to you, to all of you. You are saints now. May God bless you, give you wisdom.

Please take down your hands. Now I have to say that you all have to be collective. Now it has started but you have to grow. For that you have to come to the programs of Sahaja Yoga. You'll get all this knowledge. You don't have to pay anything for that. This is all your own which you have got it But respect your Self-realisation. It's something very unique that is happening. Please remember that you have to grow, all of you.

I'm sorry I have to leave today but next time I hope I will be able to spend more time with you.
