Shri Mataji arriving at the Ashram in Perth.

Shri Mataji: What a place, a real ashram, (unclear) you are all really (already) blessed so much isn’t it. Ah beautiful, very beautiful.  What an ashram, beautiful, (unclear), really beautiful.  Tremendous vibrations, thats beautiful, can you believe it, you are all really blessed.

Aarti is performed to Shri Mataji followed by the three great mantras which are sung to Shri Mataji by the Sahaja yogis followed by the salutation.

Yogi: Welcome to the Perth Ashram.

Shri Mataji talks to a child, Hello, recognise me, hello how are you, and rubs his head.

Yogi Warren: I have never seen him smile before.

Shri Mataji: Hello

Yogis gather around Shri Matajis chair.

Yogi: Squeeze over please everyone.

Two Sahaja Yogis bow at Shri Matajis feet.

Yogi: Christian and ?

They are staying with us for a couple of weeks.

Shri Mataji: I see, yes may God bless you

Yogi and Shri Mataji talk indistinctly for a couple of minutes, people come and namaskar before Shri Mataji. Great

Shri Mataji: Robin has not come here?

Yogi: No he will be here tomorrow, this is his second son Tim

Shri Mataji: How are you Tim now, alright? Enjoying yourself, I remember your little house upstairs.

Yogi: and George, (unclear) Robins younger one.

Shri Mataji: They are alright, are they all in the ashram now?

Yogini: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: I think all of them have a little liver problem, I don't know why, must have done something about  that, (unclear) they think too much, what are you thinking about, here you should be relaxed, nothing to think about. You will be surprised, just when we were leaving Warren came and told me my ears Mother, I have to confess something I have not got your visa to go to Australia, and we boarded the plane.  You see we just forgot about it, then we came to Singapore and this gentlemen from the ? Corporation (unclear) I told him that to please arrange the visa, and he himself was surprised I was least bothered you see. So he said how can you be? I said will be just do it, its very simple, and then I wanted to stay one more day there because the (unclear) was too much and he got the ticket also, (unclear) but what amazed him was I was not at all worried (unclear) granted the Australian visa.

So I don't think, I mean if you think actually things do not work out.  You must learn to leave it to God.  You must have thought about this program quite a lot, why? You don't think you leave it to God. (Let’s see what happens tonight).

Shri Mataji gives a bandhan. we shouldn't work on the same lines as others are, we have to work on the lines that we are in the kingdom of God.  We are beyond cause and effect.  See, maximum of essence.  By understanding that point already you got this beautiful ashram. How did you get it (Unclear) Otherwise this is not possible.

Who is next?

Yogi: Neil and Natalia

Shri Mataji: Yes

Yogi: Neil looked after the ashram while we were all in India,

Shri Mataji: Oh is he?

Yogi: and did a very good job.

Yogi: and you remember the little Jacob, little Jacob, who you met in India, a little boy, who came, and did his namaskar to your feet, a little tiny little boy.

Shri Mataji: Yes of course, may God bless you.

Yogi: and Richard and Christine, (unclear) come on

Everyone laughs. (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: Getting vibrations wherever they are.

Shri Mataji: All of them have liver you see, (unclear) something in the food we should find out. See that little bit of liver, just relax.  While coming here I also felt that very much.  I was telling Warren (unclear)

Yogi: Cyril and Andi: They have been doing Sahaja Yoga for about 18 months, they recognised you straight away.  Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: Straight away?

Yogi: They had a huge program in (?) And lots of people and we really we didn’t look very much at Cyril and Andi, and they just pestered us to death.

Shri Mataji Where is that?

Yogi: In the hills, they had a program up there and they have been tremendous, and Andis health has improved so much.  She had Multiple Sclerosis and she has had thyroid troubles, and all of that has fixed itself and she has had problems with her eyes which has gone, so the doctors were amazed.

Shri Mataji: he’s great, first day he came and he asked me such questions I was amazed

Yogi: and has he stopped since?

Shri Mataji: Very positive. Very positive

Yogi: He is extremely positive.

Shri Mataji: I think once you have very senior people very wise people, you should get some more, I was amazed at him really because normally in the west at this age people dont think of those things.

Shri Mataji: It’s alright.

Yogi: Nadine and Margaret

He knows Sahaja Yoga very well. (Unclear) How did you find it?

Yogi: Great

Shri Mataji: They love you so much, beautiful

Yogi: Shri Mataji, Eddie Was actually born in India so

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: That’s why the kundalini is so (unclear) effort, Good. (Unclear) The Indian heritage (unclear). May God bless you.

Yogi: (unclear) Wife already, (unclear) marriage certificate.

Shri Mataji: (unclear) Good, Very simple man this one, isn’t he, very innocent.

Yogi: and Kim and Jeff

Shri Mataji: Growing so well. Alright.  I am not at all tired, sucking in all my vibrations. May God bless you.  Well? sucking in fast yes?

Shri Mataji: So I was wondering on this name Perth on the actual name Perth.  In Sanskrit Parth is the word used for, Partha was the Arjunas name, Parth because he was born in Perth, I think so he was born in Perth.  And Krishna has described you see that the monkeys the best trees, banyan trees and (unclear) all like that and this word Parth is very much like that, and I have a feeling that one day this Ashram will have very great dedicated Sahaja Yogis.  (Unclear) You see it is your devotion that has given you all this, I mean I don't desire anything as you know, but even if you desire and you know if the dedication is not complete nothing works out, so that shows that you must dedicate to me and yourself,

Yogi: Thank you

Shri Mataji: may God Bless you.

Yogi: Would you like to have a rest now Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Sorry

Yogi: Would you like to have a rest now Shri Mataji? Would you like us to show you to your bedroom?

Shri Mataji: Yes I think so, (unclear) sleep off and I will wash my hair

Yogi: Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: (unclear)

Yogini: (unclear)

Yogi: We have got some special blinds Mother. (Unclear)

Conversation follows but is unclear.

Shri Mataji: I must have sat on it.

Here follows another unclear conversation.

Shri Mataji: In pure things only the vibrations show better, these altercations are (unclear)

We did very well in Calcutta and Delhi, Delhi of course Delhi was so, I mean, I have seen the (unclear) Hall have you, in one of the, that one,  New Zealand talks, that hall capacity, the whole thing was filled there, so many Sahajis the Sikhs people came, (unclear) at least a hundred, there were the sikhs. And that halls capacity it was a few hundred or so it was filled to the brim that people started flowing through the passages and started coming,  pouring towards the stage, (unclear) and I didn’t know what was going to happen, and every day, it was five days I spoke there, the lectures, all three days was such a crowd. And then to Calcutta, in Calcutta I never expected, (unclear) tremendous, tremendous, such a crowd.  (Unclear) Good people, and so very dedicated people.  (Unclear) But the best was the two poets, great poets they had come and they got into inspiration.  (Unclear) It was so beautifully done, I told them to translate it and send it over to Perth, and one of them said, that the (Ardesh), that you must give us now the orders, because you are the orders, as to what you want, it is such a power of course I understand the (unclear) language, not much but still.  But when he was just singing the vibrations were tremendous, just like mantras were said, just like pujas, were going so much, the people are very sensitive, because very emotional type people very emotional and they have a special feel for the Mother because they are worshippers of Durga and Kali.  It worked out very well.  Now we have done Madras, Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi.  Bombay is very good, puja was tremendous.

Yogi: Ah yes the daras.

Shri Mataji: Ah that was good.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, could I ask about Mahashivaratri:

Shri Mataji: Mahashivaratri was tremendous vibrations, was tremendous, we had it in the Delhi ashram, it was tremendous, I think I have some photographs, (unclear) at least I had some photographs, tremendous vibrations, Mahashivaratri. Oh yes My speech was very good, they just have to translate it you see.

Yogi: I expect we will probably read it in the Nirmala Yoga then. The speech was started in Hindi or in Marathi?

Shri Mataji: In Hindi because otherwise, I spoke in Hindi for two hours in Delhi, (unclear), because they said every time I spoke in English it would challenge people, (unclear) but there are some lectures in (unclear) Bombay I spoke once, (unclear) because we translate it, everything is translated, they are quite good at translations.

Yogi: They normally put that into the Nirmala Yoga. (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: But it is always a short form of that.  My lectures last about one and a half hours and the best part of it you see even in Calcutta it was filled with (unclear), they are supposed to be a restless violent people who react, but nobody reacted, nobody, it was very peaceful.

Yogi: Shri Mataji here is a sample of the poster we used for the advertisement.

Shri Mataji: Oh thats beautiful, oh my what a photograph, who did this one?

Yogi: Richard took the photograph, do you remember Richard originally from Melbourne, Richard and Rose, a fisherman. He took the photograph of you initially, it was really a very bright red, very vibrant red photograph.

Shri Mataji: That’s the Kalis face.  (Unclear) Normally my face is too much shining and I look too fair sometimes.

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: You see I look like Kali, you see that brownishness is there,

Yogi: I have just see it Mother,

Shri Mataji: its beautiful. (Unclear)

Yogi: Yes it’s actually browner than the original photograph.  I think with the printing that they have done here it has come out more brown, so the actual photographs of your face is paler

Shri Mataji: Paler?

Yogi: Yes, on the original.

Yogi: so It really is Kali

Shri Mataji: Mmm, Sometimes Kali.  Normally my face is pale, Sometimes its white like snow, it’s very white, it is beautiful, it is mixed with blue you see, blue. Very beautiful, This is what you advertised?

Yogi: Sorry? Mother

Shri Mataji: This is the one you have advertised?

Yogi: yes

Shri Mataji: I wish you would send this to, Mr Yogi Mahajan, Yogi Mahajan in Delhi. Some photographs there I have never liked, from where did you get this from

Yogi: From the new book

Shri Mataji: Have you seen that one.

Yogi: The second one is the only one I have seen of the new edition.

Shri Mataji: I said It’s no good, its no good,  it does no justice to me.  No He said its very very full of compassion.  I said no no its no good, its not good, not good vibrations (unclear)

He said no we will put (unclear)

I said it doesn't look like me at all.  I said now let me see, I said is it done by Jane.  He was shocked you know, how I could tell, he was so amazed.  (Unclear) Very nice one, its beautiful, when was it taken.

Yogi: I think it was taken at (Bhajan?)

Yogi: Vaitarna?

Yogini: It was taken in the temple of Shri Ram Das

Yogi: Ram Das Swami temple in (Sultan?).  You sat with us in the evening Shri Mataji,

Shri Mataji: when we went up the (unclear)

Yogini: yes

Yogi:And you slept upstairs in the (palisade?) that way.

Yogi: and this lady (unclear)

(Unclear conversation)

Shri Mataji: This looks like an advertisement. (Unclear) This one might have upset (unclear)? This one was taken by whom?

Yogi: It’s the same one.  It is the same photograph.  They have to use a different process every time and then you lose the quality.

Shri Mataji:  Just the same the vibrations are good, but, I mean when you see it like that (Shri Mataji is turning the paper in different directions to view from different angles) then you see the other side. It’s alright. You see coloured photographs look different than Black and White.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, we also have a gold toe ring which we would like to present to you, we got it made up in India

Shri Mataji: What’s that

Yogi: A gold toe ring we would like to give you

Shri Mataji: Me

Shri Mataji is handed the toe ring.

Yogi: would you like me to put it on for you? (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: Who made this?

Yogi: Yes.  They made it in Bombay for us, we asked them to make it.

Shri Mataji: (unclear) its such a beautiful toe ring (unclear)

Yogi: This is, we went into a jeweller with a silver one of these and we asked if they could make it in Gold in 22ct gold and so they said yes we could do it and they made it for us very very quickly.

Shri Mataji: Which toe do I put it on?

Yogi: We thought, with the two petals its up to you,

Shri Mataji: we can open it,

Yogi: No but I what we will do if it doesn't fit Mother we will cut it and make it fit (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: Actually we can fix it alright, we can put it (unclear)

Yogi: We will need to cut it Shri Mataji and open it out a bit cos its very (unclear)

Follows unclear talk.

Shri Mataji: They have some ways of increasing the size of it. (Unclear)

Yogi: They expand a bit

Shri Mataji: That may spoil it.

Shri Mataji: But it is better always to have a toe ring like this. (Unclear)

Yogi: I hoped that you might put it on the (unclear)

Shri Mataji: (Unclear)

Yogi: We can get that

There follows indistinguishable talk as they try to fit the toe ring onto Shri Matajis feet. Shri Mataji mentions that the left agnya is good.

Next day.

42.37 There is some talking and music playing (unclear) Shri Mataji again enquires about a yogi.

Yogi: he will be here tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: Mooladhara (unclear)

Shri Mataji: (unclear)  This is the dining room? The kitchen is where? That side? It is connected?

Yogini: You have to walk around.

Shri Mataji: Through here

Shri Mataji: Unclear There is no exit

Yogini: (unclear) It is connected, you can go out through that door into the garden and through another door in the kitchen.  (Unclear) This was originally this was the dining room in here

Yogi: this is the family room.

Shri Mataji: This is the family room?

Yogi: yes

Shri Mataji:There is the dining room there?

Yogini: It’s a bedroom now.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I was wondering you always have this kind of a one family room (unclear) one for outsiders, and one for yourselves?

Yogi: We dont have many copies of Ravi Shankar music but we have (unclear)

Shri Mataji questions the choice of music.

Shri Mataji: You see this now is do do do do, its (unclear).there’s no flow at all. (Unclear)  He is nervous I think.  I was telling them you should buy some records at this stage, (unclear) Indian classical music. He said they have got it a lot of it.  I kept quiet. But next time when you come to India you must buy.

Shri Mataji: (unclear) This is another (unclear)

Another tape is put on.

Shri Mataji: In the beginning what they play is the (unclear) is the one where (unclear) the one when it rises and falls, when it rises its called avroha and aroha when it falls its called aroha.(Unclear) That’s how they make the melody. So now what he is playing just now is called as (nomtum unclear) is the beginning of the play of any music they start, they don’t have the beat to begin with, first they tell you the, how it is built and they play all the intricate notes and things.  Just now he is showing.  Normally it doesn't start so early, but its a recording perhaps thats why, normally it starts after some time after they have built the raga.  Aroha is the rising and avroha is the coming down, all the notes that are to be used that moves that are to be avoided, this raga is (Tilaka unclear) This melody is a (Tilaka unclear).  There are 900 ragas which are known ragas, called as Rasida which means famous, and Prasida are those that are not known, we can combine, make, and there are some ragas which are not normally known.  These are the permutations and combinations.

Yogi: asks an unclear question about the tempo and the tabla player.

Shri Mataji No No he knows, you see it is not, there are, thing is these are to be played.  This is the raga is to be played, now we have a definite idea about the talas, we have talas in 16, or we have talas in 12, we have talas in 6 and also we have got talas in also 10, we have got talas in 28 also. So as soon as he tells him, as soon as he plays one tune in the beginning, if you can push it back, I will tell you how he started,

Yogi: unclear)Can you rewind back?

Yogini: unclear reply

Shri Mataji: First you see what happens that he starts playing the first note (unclear)  at that time he just says what sort of a raga he is playing, it has nothing to do with the tala with the (Pakasha unclear) nothing to do it is the raga he plays.  Now in that the only thing is, the point is that they have to see that the pitch of the instrument should be the same as the pitch of the tabla. Thats important. That’s the only combination.  Now he plays first of all the, first of all the, he builds up the thing, if they know each other he might tell him that first, I’ll start with Ek tala, Jak tala or whatever he tells him, if he doesn't know, also if in one line he knows what is to be played which tala to be used, and then he uses that tala and he plays that, its as simple as that.  Let’s start now.

Yogi: From the beginning of the raga would you like to hear.

Shri Mataji: Yes Yes. Just let them see.  It’s very simple.  Now this is how they are building the raga and once it goes into your head you can make out the Raga, but because being a record it is not that systematic.  It has to be really systematic music then you enjoy it, because they build the foundations first and then they give all the design and patterns, they fill it up, it is very interesting there.  Now this is, in this one he has played little bit of the beginning what you call the sargham, means the notes, sargham, now slowly he is playing.  This is how he is going to play.  One ears are tuned as soon as he plays the first note we know what it is.  This raga is more used for dedication and devotion, expression of the beauty of God.

Shri Mataji is seated ready to eat and a Yogini is serving the food.

Shri Mataji: I didn’t know you were such a great cook.

Yogini: Krysta has prepared it.

Shri Mataji: I dont know from where you learnt all this from and the taste was so good, you see normally taste is not so good.

Yogini:  (unclear)

Shri Mataji: You serve me. It is Chinese style?

Yogini: Yes Mother

Shri Mataji: That’s all, thank you.

(Unclear) Now here they are playing Ek Tala, ah, you see like that you see 12 matras and then it comes to the first you see, then hit on that.  But it can go into many (Altanas unclear), but first note of the raga (bukti unclear) should be tallied with that first, thats how it is.

Shri Mataji: What’s that?

Yogini: Would you like some rice?

Shri Mataji: Yes alright, a little.

What about you people, Mother should not eat before the children have eaten, when are you going to have your food?

Yogi: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: (Unclear) Now the tabla fellow is playing on the permutations combinations and that time he is just holding the line is all.  The tabla first.  This is the tune he is playing, this is number one.  It’s perfect harmony, when he plays just the tune he plays the complete permutations and combinations on the tabla. See the tune he is playing, the tabla fellow is playing.

Very nice (referring to food)

The base is Des raga, It is a (unclear) raga, it makes you thoughtless.  I was feeling isn’t it that we should buy some records for that on the tabla. I was telling that Sydney people have got a lot of it but not these.

Yogi: You haven’t got bhajans?

Yogi: We have got some (unclear)

Shri Mataji: I think we have to develop a musical group also.  That’s the best way to spread sahaja yoga, musical groups are very important, in the west specially.  I see, they are mad with music (unclear) Really.

Yogi: Literally mad

Shri Mataji: For a short time I saw one group, one fellow, some young boys? this that, (unclear) singing of God, white dress, mesmerising all the Americans, you see all young and old all singing went Crazy afternoon and when he got up they all ran after him, this thing, and that,  thousands, those stupid people I don’t know. How to treat them? ? was describing to me this (western unclear) man. (Unclear)

Yogi: I was telling you In London he had a number of concerts like this, in the snow even he was standing out there in his white kaftan.

Shri Mataji: That was a picture about him only, I think. (Unclear) Very much conditioning, bad ideas about this start imagining, you know this music is going inside and there’s something great to them and  they must act like that, behave in that fashion, its all outside and nothing happens inside.  It’s a thing of just imagination and conditioning, complete conditioning to believe like that.  It is something that doesn't happen.  I met once, a pilot who was the brother of the fellow who did this, who was the people who started the beetles, you see this fellow was the brother of that, and he told me it was all manipulation.  He had some girls in front and all those people singing and when they started singing all this AH AH AH AH, you see they paid for.  And so many followed that and then a sort of a mob frenzy started and he said, my brother I have nothing to do with his ill gotten money.  See the tabla and the balance.  The tune he is playing, The tabla is (unclear).  A little more can you have? This is the main dish, nothing afterwards?

Yogini: There is something, some fruit.

Shri Mataji: A little thats fine. Thank you. That’s fine

How many of you can sing well?  After realisation it happens, you know very much the sound of the voice

Yogi: improves so much

Yogi: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: The sweetness you see.  I think you should get some teacher to teach you how to sing and you can form a group.

Yogi:There are quite a few Musicians in Perth.

Shri Mataji: You should do that.

Yogi: Matthew is playing in the Western Australian Youth Orchestra

Shri Mataji: Is he?

Yogi: He’s taken to the Indian music

But he is fed up with western music having just coming back from India.

Shri Mataji:  Really?

Yogi: This is very sublime music

Shri Mataji: That’s it.

Yogi: It takes you beyond.

Shri Mataji: When they, you see right sided people also going for everything new every time something new.  Back in music also, with the kind of music they are having, all kinds you see, they never had this before, suddenly that shot up, this kind, that kind, rock and roll and there’s another one and it becomes a craze. It comes up to a point when the craze goes away.  Indian music is not like that,  it is very consistent in all ways every time and very deep rooted.  Some people try to change the form like Ravi Shankar, its thrown out.  Its so deep you cannot absorb it.  Of course you had some great composers like Mozart and all that but thats composition, here everything is done by one person.

Yogi: Mmm

Shri Mataji:  So you have to know the principle, thats all, you should know, the principle you should get it in your fingers, thats all.  Keep to the principle and do it what way you like.  Moreover one side of the western music is with the composers that it is spontaneous, comes to them spontaneously, and the other side of it is that those who play dont use their own imagination or anything, just play it and they practice it alright.  But here is their integration, that you should also contain as to create and produce, but for that they have to work very hard to begin with to build the technique, they master the technique, they master the technique and the creativity, they are stepped, hand in hand, the creativity and the technique, both should work together.

Yogi: (unclear) All the time he is playing he is remembering the raga, so he is always, while he is playing he always has the roots in the melody which is the raga.  He is improvising and making up the melody, but he is always remembering...

Shri Mataji: That’s the maryada, thats the maryada.  You can’t go beyond that, but its not that, he is not thinking,  its just in his hands.

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: He is just trying to ease your spirit. With the movement of that raga, but these ragas are worked out very scientifically, they dont just happen, but there is no chance for the ego to play in ragas you see.  Like you can go whichever way you like. Some people just suddenly rearrange in western music, it just suddenly shoots out, you dont know.  According to us it is based around, it is not concord not synchronised, it is based other way round it first based on the OM, it should be the OM, a composite OM, it should form it should give the joy of the OM.  So anything that is not congenial to that is not there.  A void. So the whole thing is based the other way round. You cannot go off, if you try to go off the raga you wont enjoy it.  It’s all worked out very well you see what they did was to play it to the kundalini, it is so sincere and when the Kundalini rose they said ‘this is the raga’, otherwise not, on vibrations.  It’s an offering to God and you must know what to offer which way he likes isn’t it.  It’s a very fast number.

Yogi: Tremendous playing.

Shri Mataji: It starts ( unclear limbic), (unclear limbic) is slow, and then the jala, this is the jala,and the faster notes but they may change the tala, first may be the teen tala and then the Ek tala, first the jala and then the tala.  Mostly they have teen taal for the jala which is 16 beats, Ek tala is 12.  The tabla is such an intricate stuff isn’t it.  I dont know how to integrate western music with Indian Music there’s a different origins, different origins maybe.  In its individual way some say Mozart and all that is something unique no doubt about it, but if you try to mix them up it doesn't work out.

Yogi: It’s difficult

Shri Mataji: Yes difficult to integrate them. But, why?  We can have different flowers, there’s no need to integrate, it should not be such.

Yogini asks Mother if She would like some more dinner.

Shri Mataji: No, thankyou. Thankyou.

Yogi: Trouble is Shri Mataji, very little of western music is pleasing for the spirit is...the basis is not

Shri Mataji:  No you can find it. Find out, you are all born realised, you are all realised souls, you are born again.  You can find out ways and methods which will please, through western music, which will please the hearts of the people and the spirit.  You can find out because you can work it out on your own chakras.  The revival you see has to come, and see what sort of it.  But I dont think there is any way of,  its like you see a thing thats like an ocean, you dont know where to put your hand, sort of thing it is western music.It’s not compartmental or its not, anybody who wanted to compose, has composed, anybody who wanted to play has come, its too much of a arbitrary business. That’s the trouble is.  So now for you to make any music, you have to do it with a little understanding that it should appeal to your vibrations.  If it appeals to your vibrations alright, if it does not its not. And, a new method must be targeted, because this was not done.  Mozart was a born realised so he did it alright he was a born realised, but how many understand that also is the point, he was a real genius, I tell you, with what force he moves sometimes, he moves with such force that the kundalini just surges out like that, like that, its tremendous.  Mozart is great.   But he did it because he was a realised soul, you see whatever appealed to him he did it.  But thats how you can do it also you can all be Mozarts, why not? But you must sit down with it.  First you must understand the basics of classical western music, basics, though jazz is something better, jazz is.  Yes it has something.  You see its agreed that it sometimes it can be funny in man, but I mean its a good deviation, more on the, more on the spontaneous side.  I mean if you people try your hand on the jazz style you might do well.

Yogi: The structure is quite similar to the western to the indian raga in where you have the melody.         Which is the same as the raga and then you have the improvisation which should be based around the melody, so if only the roots of jazz were perhaps....

Shri Mataji:  If you take to jazz and build it up in such a way that it doesn't make you feel funny, some notes are very deviating no doubt,  but if you build up yourself you will know what is to be done on the jazz style. My nephew is a great admirer of jazz jazz.

Yogi: I think its much more creative than classical music too because the musician is creating all the time, its spontaneous.

Shri Mataji: No. But when you will hear, say Mozart or anyone like that, you can find out what makes the thing so beautiful, what notes he follows, how he does it.  How it moves, you see thats the thing, like that.  My sister has done a PHD with this thing, what was the reason why they selected this as the raga suitable for this raga, why, what was the thing that made them think that this will fit into this raga.

I only gave out the subject, but she worked on it, she got her PHD.  So you have to hear it, you see what makes him such a great composer, what’s so special about it.  Actually the whole thing plays like a torrential movement of his heart.  Absolutely, like that it moves very fast, and then he brings it down and stops it, and beautiful it is, but only a realised soul can understand that.  It is a new venture which you can work out, and anything new will appeal very much to the western mind.  Do you think you can you go into that.

Yogi: It’s rather curious you talking about this Mother because the one sitting before you started in the conservatorium of music in Sydney and his preference was for jazz and actually he was playing jazz and when he got his realisation, because it wasn’t expressing the joy of the Atma, he, wasn’t, and, he was doing it in all sorts of abusive ways, he dropped it. Now he’s gone away from music, now he is coming back to music, he is playing the big double bass in the Perth Symphony Orchestra and now he is even getting dissatisfied with that and possibly he will even be going back to that jazz.

Shri Mataji: You see the reason is you must yourself create, thats the point, Jazz that is created by others cannot be up to the point.  But you can create yourself with jazz yourself.  Yourself a symphony, you can create it, why not?

Yogi:  I remember him doing improvisations in his, when he was a very young boy, on a clarinet and on a flute, beautiful improvisations, that was great.

Shri Mataji: I mean if you want you can study Indian music to begin with, a little to have the base it  it bows you down,  thats the point you know, but I have seen people who know Indian music can sing  English music, western music very well.

Yogi: Yes. Perhaps you should go to a few of these concerts, Harish, Mothers nephew, went to a very very good jazz concert in Delhi just recently.

Shri Mataji: if he is so much interested.

Shri Mataji: Yes I mean jazz conference in Delhi.

Yogi: It’s really expressive stuff, I heard some of the music on tape.

Shri Mataji:  They had a percussion conference, percussion and he took that German boy, and the German boy was absolutely flabbergasted, he said “wow” because we have so many types of percussions, that, this and that, was really mad, he just couldn't understand, and (unclear) Jamal and all these geniuses they played there.  So this is just ordinary I should say.  But if you listen to anybody playing for the Katak style of dancing it is tremendous.  Beautiful cherries? I dont know how you get them at this time.

Yogi: Grapes or cherries?

Shri Mataji: grapes or cherries, I was wondering what,

Yogini: Grapes

Yogi: Grapes

Shri Mataji: oh, grapes? Oh the colour

A little girl hands out food to people.

Yogi: Oh thankyou, lovely, good.

Shri Mataji: For grandma

These are grapes. I wondered you get cherries at this time! Very good taste, can I keep it here, I dont want to spoil, could I have it here and here.

Yogi: just a little plate for Mother.

Shri Mataji: Good to have a plate.

Yogini: A small one?

Shri Mataji: one little plate

Shri Mataji: You get good rice here Warren. It’s not a rice growing area.

Yogi: Yes we grow rice in the irrigation area, oh but not here, no I dont think so.

Another yogi answers: up North

Yogi: Sorry

Yogi 2: Up North

Shri Mataji: Quite long grain one, quite good.

Yogi: Just put it within reach of Mother

Shri Mataji: Yes good, these are another type of grapes thats how I misunderstood. You get these grapes here?

Yogini: Yes they grow here.

Shri Mataji: because are like Indian grapes I tell you.  In Pune you get very good grapes you know. There must be a way of importing these plants here though, If you write to the government.

Yogi: You can bring them in under quarantine, and they stay there for a certain number of months and then you can use them.

Shri Mataji: See, there are some, many other qualities, which are very fragrant, they definitely grow here, because its the same climate.  The fragrance is too much in Delhi, too much fragrance.  You can find out if they would allow you to and import.  They grow sandalwood here?

Yogi: That’s what they were just telling me, Mother I didn’t know that.

Shri Mataji: Just imagine.

Yogi: I mean really its part of India Mother.

Shri Mataji: I can see that.

Yogi 2: It’s native to Western Australia, sandalwood

Shri Mataji: What’s that?

Yogi 2: sandalwood is a native tree to Western Australia.

Yogi: does it have the same fragrance

Yogi 2nd: They export most of it to India so....

Shri Mataji: Where do they export?

Yogi: to India

Shri Mataji: Why

Yogi: There must be a market

Shri Mataji: That’s true, thats only sold in India, I think that people dont have much value for it otherwise. In India we can’t do without sandalwood, isn’t it?

Probably they used to make in England, and all this places, I dont know where, I have seen statues made of sandalwood and ivories.  I have seen some people playing cards sitting together on different chairs of sandalwood and very cards in the hands, and their hands are also with the gloves is ivory and all the little frills here, in our museum in Bombay we have that. So they used to come by ivory and sandalwood and make such interesting things and sometimes, ivory, sandalwood and gold also.

Yogi: Gold would look very nice with the sandalwood.

Shri Mataji: It does look nice.

We Indians have very much grouped because of the left side.  In sandalwood they will be making only elephants so many types of, elephants, elephants.  I mean they wont make anything else, but elephants you know.  Somehow or other in rosewood also you will find only elephants, elephants.  They cannot sell those elephants you know.  They tell them anything and they say we dont know how to make. You go in any shop with such big elephants to small small small all over the country, nothing but elephants of rosewood.  Who is going to buy so many elephants, what are they going to do about it?

Yogi: at least its elephants though Mother and not some stupid

Shri Mataji: Agreed, but you are going too far with it also.  So they make tables out of it, two sides two elephants, I have got, and two elephants at the other end, and a table, and a coffee table, to lift it you need three elephants.

You know in my drawing room I have with ivory work and on the ivory also, its elephants only,  ivory work also its elephants.  It was a marriage party procession so there also we have nothing but elephants, this, that,  I mean they cant think of something better? I don’t know.

Yogi: Are they a symbol of something Mother?

Shri Mataji: Yes, I mean Ganesha, after all, but to what extent you can go you see.  Because made out of ivory, with lots of them, thats the only animal they see, say like in the European countries they make horses. They make elephants.  Standing elephants, dancing elephants, you see, trunks like that.  And human beings we don’t make in India.  That’s one thing you never find, nowadays they are making some old people because of the modern ideas, you see with, all the bones showing you see an old man walking like that.

Yogi: The Christian’s make lots of horrible models of Jesus.

Shri Mataji: Oh yes, but that is the Christians thats all, they cannot go any further with it.

Yogi: The aborigines in Australia, the natives in Australia, do a lot of carvings of themselves standing with spears and

Shri Mataji: I mean at least they, these Indians will never do,  I mean have you seen any indian doing his own carving. But now later on it started the ladies, they started doing a little bit, with the say a lady standing, with a particular type of a dress or another, That’s what they started, a little bit not much, but you will find lady statues standing with a sari on, very few, but a mother and a child you might find, but very few lost in the crowds of elephants I tell you.

I was on their committee, thats why I am telling you.  You see the difference is that the tamasicas will go on with the thing that they have been doing and rajasicas will be giving up, no, not this, not this.  So they have lost all their deftness, they have lost all their quality to do any work you see, so they just go no, no, not today, tomorrow, or something else then another one.

Yogi: Stupid then

Shri Mataji: But thats how they become stupid.  But its also stupid to go on making the same the same thing, they cannot change themselves.

Yogi: It’s a very good example actually of what you are talking about, how we really cant settle on anything.

Shri Mataji: Nothing! That’s the point.

Yogi The only thing we do is make our machines and thats it.

Shri Mataji: What happens is that you become frivolous also because you never discover the depth of anything thats it.

Yogi: No patience

Shri Mataji: No patience, chuck chuck chuck chuck

Yogi: Very unsatisfying.

Shri Mataji: Yesterdays picture of that was very good of Emmanuel, he was to run after good looking girls and how he was placed into difficulties one after another, and how he was befooled, and ultimately discovered that his wife is the best, his children are the best you see. It was a little funny, it was a bit too much of it, but still, all the stupidity they showed.  And they criticised Indian men that they are cowards you see,  they don’t want to leave their wives.  They are cowards according to the western people.  They dont know how to cook, thats why they dont want to change their wives.

Yogi: What you were saying (unclear).  Maybe we have taken a little too leisurely view of getting Sahaja yoga out in amongst the people.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it happens you see, when they are....the same thing happened in Switzerland.  When you see Arnaud became very unpopular because he was the leader, and he  said, he wrote to me saying That Mother, “its a picnic, Geeta going on here, its a picnic geeta, nice come, nice people”, nice people sit down together, having a nice comfortable time.  He said become a private affair. And thats it, but it should be a big campaign you see, you should go with a big campaign for one year, work it hard? In a big way otherwise it wont work out.  See naturally the comfort always you see enslaves you, naturally it happens like that.  Especially if you go to India, then aah, they think how can we bring that here, see that all the people are different, you know you just start feeling the disparity very much, so how come so let it be them go to hell it doesn't matter we enjoy ours.

Yogi: It’s a bit of a trap coming back from that situation.

Shri Mataji: Yes isn’t it, its a trap.

Yogi: We should assume our powers more, and really see what we can do.

Shri Mataji: And you should also see what they are there, Indians are, and what about our people here.

We should have the fellowman, feeling of the fellowman, you see sahaja yoga is not for our private use, not at all , it is what I call a Samayoga? it’s towards,  it faces the society, it faces the people, it faces the whole universe, its not for us, but we are so blessed, also we get a nice ashram, a nice car, and nice children, everything’s so fine. So we take everything for granted, that’s not the way, I hope its not happened to other centres in Sydney and all these places?

Yogi: I dont think so.  I hope not, we will wait and see.

Shri Mataji: See because he’s away, and thats what I am saying, you shouldn't worry about other centres, better worry about this it should not go down.  But Austria as I told you Austria is a place, Gregoire is there, see he is like a big engine behind them and he doesn't go anywhere because he keeps himself in a sort of a way, a secret way, because he’s a diplomat.  What he does he asks people to go and see this newspaper fellow, go and see that radio fellow you go and see those people, then contact other organisations, and what are you doing here, this is nothing, we have found, this is the thing now, the Holy Ghost is here.  How will you know, and he wrote letters to pope he did everything that was possible under the circumstances, and he went and saw so many people in the churches and brought them out.  Whole year he works like that, and now he has shifted to the Ashram also.   His wife is so negative, it doesn't matter, he doesn't bother about it, and thats how he has brought out and everywhere, not only in...but in.. he was transferred to Rome, Gregoire was great you know,  in Rome he did tremendous work. In Rome You imagine, you were with me? When I went to Italy to that place, what you call that Como And Milano, Milano was a hall at least four times bigger than yours, and everywhere you saw nothing but human beings all packed.  Milano was at least 4,000 people.  Rome the same thing, Rome never never less than 2,000.  But they are all the time working.  Gregoire was there and he was just blasting them and this time it was in Milano of all the places, just imagine where Gregorio did not go but some Sahaja Yogi, what is his name, this one?, I’ll get it in a second, young fellow, he did everything,

Yogi: Dhulio,

Shri Mataji: Dhulio, Dhulio, Dhulio, he’s an educated boy and his father is in the business, and, I mean the father is not very much there, but doesnt matter he has done it.  And such a crowd, you cant imagine, and then after the program there were some priests and one priest came up and he said Mother now we have to thank you for giving us the experiment of the spirit, and I say She is the Holy Ghost and he stood up and said all kinds of things and now he is a great Sahaja Yogi. But this was all done before they met people, went and talked to people in the church, imagine, and to do it in Italy, can you imagine the popes Italy.

Everyday they have some programs, something like that, they go to this place to do this there to do that, and they had no ashram, thats one thing, they had no Ashram in Rome, now they have and I am worried about that.  They have a huge big place as an ashram.

Yogi: I have seen some photos of it.

Shri Mataji:  You saw it. Its tremendous isn’t it.  They said its out of the blue, its so cheap, they got it, and they can’t believe it, and it is beautiful.

1.35

Yogi: Yes I think there might be a bit of a guru geeta picnic going on here.

Yogi 2: With the publicity was a problem because we had the.. some interviews lined up on the first day which we had to cancel which meant we had to rest on the newspaper advertisement for...

Shri Mataji: No, but I think it should be done.

Yogi: Mother is talking about going out into the community, a campaign.

Shri Mataji:  You see you should advertise beforehand, you must tell them beforehand.  That’s not the point about my coming, but about Sahaja Yoga Ashram.  Sahaja Yoga, you should advertise, see, you should advertise, Sahaja Yoga Ashram, come along, get rid of your tensions, get rid of your troubles, you have found the thing.  Like that you can advertise your ashram.   Have people here every, you must have a public program here every week, must have, one public program here.

Yogi: We have three per week

Shri Mataji: But public, you advertise

Yogi: We normally publicise in the local suburban papers.

Shri Mataji: But what you can do is to see some people, some, find out about how many groups there are, the people who are lost, so many people are there, go and see them, and, make, I mean there must be ways and methods of doing it.

1.36.20.

Yogi: Yes we must try something else.

Shri Mataji: There must be some PROs and something, go and talk to them, just find out, you must spread out, it becomes like that you see, little taken for granted.  There’s nothing new I noticed.

Yogi: Adelaides been having programs over the last ten weeks, and last night at their program last night they had 37 people, new people, and they have been getting people coming in.  They are not going to have a public program like you are having they are just having these people that have come over the last 10 weeks into the ..to take things further with Mother.

Shri Mataji:  But Adelaide has a big ashram now, we can have lots of people for a workshop or something.

Yogi: We will see what happens.

Yogi 2: We will certainly try to do as much as we possibly can.

Shri Mataji: Alright see how it works out.  Bombay was like this for some time and suddenly I give them a pep talk one day, so you should see Bombay now.  I think, I’ve sort of seen at least 5 to 6,000 people in the program.  And all the Bombay poor say in Bombay harbour here in Bombay and any public place like the aerodrome and all like that,  and they all know me very well, everyone knows it.  I am surprised how they know me.

Yogi: This is it, I think its mainly we should be getting into the media more. Getting them to know us more, that we are normal, we have got nothing to hide.  This fellow, who tomorrow morning he will be interviewing....

Shri Mataji: (unclear)

Yogi: He said perhaps you could set up an independent body to look into the different groups and in London you have spoken about that very same thing, the Golden the new age thing..

Yogi 2: The new age publicity organisation.

Yogi: Yes, it was called the Golden Age.

Shri Mataji: I see

Yogi: It was where you were talking about establishing an independent group to look at all the cults, all the different groups and write it all down to make some notes, some books,  including Sahaja Yoga and come along to sahaja yoga and see what’s wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Who says?

Yogi: There was a talk that you gave in London,

Shri Mataji: I?

Yogi 2: when you formed the Golden

Yogi: Golden publicity international....

Yogi: The Golden Age International.  It was an organisation in which David and a number of other people were going to participate to establish an investigation into all the cults. In which you should also include Sahaja Yoga, you know, let people independent...

Shri Mataji: I did that?

Yogi: Yes you gave a long talk about it

Shri Mataji: Where?

Yogi: In Chelsham Road

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: You see we have got all the tapes and we watch you very carefully, (unclear) everywhere.

Shri Mataji is smiling

Yogi: But the interesting thing was he spoke about the same thing, why dont you set up an organisation to look at these people which will bring Sahaja Yoga out as being the normal one, the normal one, the right one.  And he was really very keen about it, so we should, I think, be working with this man, I just hope that tomorrow he’ll be what he says he’ll be.

Shri Mataji: I would like to see that before, what you are talking about. Tomorrow morning I can have a look at it before he comes to me I would like to know what it is about.  To comfort my mind I’m like also western people when they are having new ideas.

Yogi: It was a very enjoyable evening we had a lot of fun there so

Shri Mataji: They are good, we met one fellow who was the, what was that new thing they were doing in programming in London where the one fellow came in and was very much impressed and  he was talking...Saxo? Saxo?.....Anglo Saxon brains!

Yogi: Oh Yes.  That was Manifest? The program was called Manifestations or something like that, where anybody, who had some rather supernatural experience..

Shri Mataji:  Yes! Now its clear.  Now this fellow came to me and he said Mother the Anglo Saxon brain will never understand anything where you don’t take money.  I mean are they the doomed people and then he talked to me about other various things.  But I think he has a guru, someone say some, according to him this is not possible that I can have Sahaja Yoga without taking money.  But here the main point here was having about I must take money because he must have given money to some guru and he wants to justify it.

Yogi 2: Mother I was talking to a couple of the french Sahaja Yogis and they are charging a small amount of money now I see for booklets and tapes where they say to the people that

Shri Mataji: Tapes alright, booklets alright.

Yogi2: They have like a little program where they say come along for 5 weeks and each time  the person feels like they are paying a little bit each time.

Yogi 1: You said they tried it as an experiment to Alexander, and see what happens

Yogi 2: and its working very well.

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Yogi: Yes people feel they are getting something..

Shri Mataji: Yes get some free money something,. Alright I dont mind, but that you can take, not me.

Yogi: Mmm

Shri Mataji: It’s alright, because you can use it for your own organising, or your publishing for what you call your advertising, its alright.

Yogi: well if its just to pay for the tapes themselves, or the booklets, we are not making any commission.

Shri Mataji: For books you can also take some money, there’s no harm in taking that much money, say after some time you can even take for the hall.  You can say that we have to pay for the hall something like that.  You can make a budget, show them.  Thats alright, thats spending between yourselves you see.  That way they see Sahaja Yoga people pay money,  like in Bombay they have a collection called Life Eternal for which they pay money per month, out of which they spend money for advertising and for the (Unclear seminars) they have, and also for what you call halls for other  things, and sometimes they pay for my ticket also.  Sometimes, they do pay that, so it is you see, so it is used for some purpose.  But I have nothing to do, I never see accounts, I have nothing to do with it you see even the....

Yogi: They manage it themselves?

Shri Mataji: Yes thats so, now supposing you are running this Ashram, then you are getting the money from everybody and everybody’s  paying and you are working it out.  But you are not paying for Sahaja Yoga, thats the point is, on principle you are not paying for Sahaja Yoga for vibrations, for curing or anything.  What you are paying for is what you are spending for. You see  supposing you pay for my ticket you pay to the aeroplane not to me, now there’s another one which you people have been rather over generous about which I having fight with this gentleman is this, that you give me presents sometimes, but I try to return them somehow, the presents by giving materially, but I say dont give me too much because then I have to give you too much also.  That’s what I was telling you.  This time you collected 10,000 rupees to buy a mangal sutra, that was too much I felt from, I was telling you not to do like that. But they said they have already collected, this is a separate money, this, that, but you are also very lucky, thats another problem, too lucky, and you get things so cheap and so good, I mean It’s unbelievable.  But I mean little presents you want to give to me its alright, I can take return it back by giving you presents all of you something.  Like the puja money, now you give me, what I have decided the puja money if you give then what to do, then I cannot return it, under protocol It is my money, so what to do now.  So I decided to buy some silver and give it to you for puja with my name, so what you call, my name is there, its mine, I can take it back from you, so.  But after all I mean we have to do all those things, there is no harm if I take away anything from you, there’s no harm, after all its mine, no doubt the whole world is mine.  But we  have to keep that as a model, because otherwise everybody will start doing the same thing.  So we have to use it as a model, that we dont take any money for Sahaja Yoga.  Otherwise tomorrow somebody will say, alright now I will give you, vibrations to you, come along give me so much money, isn’t it?

Yogi: Yes, just directly for vibrations.

Shri Mataji: You sit on there. Because I know tall people have a problem sitting on the ground, I know my husband is like that.  You may sit there, be comfortable, its very difficult for tall people to sit on the ground.

Yogi: Shri Mataji Many of them won’t see that little gift.

Shri Mataji: Yes better show it, yes, I know its quite big, the story is like this.  You see we went, they wanted to buy a mangal sutra.  Now this one that was even smaller than this, the one we saw, half the size was for 10,000. This see is diamond, so they said, this would not be less than 15,000, so I told Warren why do you want to buy such an expensive thing , to buy, not of diamonds,  but ordinary, so he wouldn’t accept to it you see.  So suddenly I felt the vibrations, I turned around and there what I find is a beautiful necklace of coral done in roses, it was beautiful.  You should see that.  I said this is good and in those 10,000 we got a coral, coral mangal sutra in gold, a coral man gal sutra in gold real gold, a coral in gold, plus that thing, plus the ear tops with that to match, plus something else.  We bought three or four things, I dont know what he bought.  All of coral in that amount. Aah, and he got something out of that I think for the New Zealand people because they would like to give me something as a present, so all these four things were bought out of that, 10,000, and you would have bought a little diamond, of such, out of that 10,000 and I already have one so what’s the use of having it, now you have got one manual sutra and all these things, so then he said now Mother, what do you say, and when they calculated the amount it was the same.  I just kept quiet I didn’t want to say anything anymore. It’s playing upon me, and they said we cannot make this for you, just it was made, it was kept here for days and we cannot make, even if you order we cannot make it.  I have told them the story.

Yogi: Yes It was very interesting, the mangal sutra we...

Shri Mataji: Let them see that

Yogi: Yes there you are.

Shri Mataji: This is the mangal sutra of,

Yogi: Guess whats its made of

Yogi: see the corals

Yogi: See the corals

Yogini: Red coral!

Shri Mataji: Red coral because this is the country of corals, in Gold.

Muffled excited talking

Yogi: Not the string, the pendant.

Shri Mataji: Red corals beautiful red corals

Yogi: So as well as the mangal sutra we got this beauty.

Shri Mataji: All corals

Yogi: Red corals.

Yogini: Amazing

Yogi: isn’t it Beautiful

Shri Mataji: They said we can’t make it, we cannot order it, we just got it with that.

Corals you see.  This is a country of corals, and they said this is something out of the blue, in the same amount, and the third thing we got in the same amount.  It is for New Zealand.  Also they are all very lucky people, aren’t they,  see the vibrations, just see the vibrations.  Just let it go round, let them see, did you see this one? They didn’t have a proper string but we will put a proper string to it, but this is alright for the time being.  Can you believe it? The ladies must see.  You cant believe it.  I mean this is India, and see the colour of the coral.

Yogi: Everyone can, come, everyone can come.

Shri Mataji: It’s very expensive, very expensive, thats why they said we cant make its with us, you can have it, but if you order us we cant make one. All different shapes.

Yogi: The whole lot we got for the 10,000 instead of one little piece.

Shri Mataji: No, they will be very happy New Zealanders.  Whole lot in the same 10,000. It’s why I kept quiet.

Shri Mataji: What’s it?

Yogini: Mother Would you like to try some, of this dessert, its strawberry yoghurt.

Shri Mataji: Yoghurt I dont take.  Because of the throat you see I have to speak so much.

It’s nice isn’t it (examining the mangal sutra)

Yogi:   There’s air conditioning  in the room too Mother, It’s very dry it dries the air out Mother.

Yogi: its not on excessively now.

Shri Mataji: We dont need

Yogi:  and I dont think Mother will need it much. Now that that weather....

Shri Mataji: No. It’s alright.  Did you see this one? It’s alright.

Let them see, let all of them see, its something really out of the blue, I mean you are very lucky people, thats why I keep quiet, I say it was made only for me, (Looking at the mangal sutra), very delicate this one.

Yogi: So this is what we got for the mangal sutra, but you also know we had a.....

Shri Mataji: we have to get a chain for it thats all. (Unclear)

Yogi:  Your brother Is bringing the birthday present.

Yogini remarks on necklace, but unclear.

Shri Mataji: Isn’t it, see the colour, we dont get this colour in India, I dont know from where they got it made, they are very delicate things there are.

Yogi: This is the natural colour of the coral.

Shri Mataji: This is the natural colour of the particular coral, normally you dont get this colour, here you dont get this colour isn’t it.  But I think I saw some in Italy, but they are very expensive, very expensive to do this work and all that, and I dont know how they have managed it.

Yogi: Mother may I hold it up against your neck.

Shri Mataji: Let’s see

Yogi: Shouldnt do this I think.

Yogi holds it to Shri Matajis neck.

Yogis: aah, its very beautiful, they all clap

Shri Mataji: It is Ganeshas stone you see, such vibrations, beautiful and thats so well at the back also, so beautiful it is.

Yogi: It is done so well

Yogi: They said it has been sitting there for years.

Shri Mataji: So they said, yes, it has been sitting there for years they said

Yogi: and its really....

Shri Mataji: There’s something happening here.

Yogi: It’s the way the coral is Mother.

Shri Mataji: Natural coral.

Yogi: I mean somebody was saying it looks...

Shri Mataji: Artificial,

Yogi: it looks so perfect that it looks artificial

Shri Mataji: Imagine, nobody saw this also before, perhaps in all that junk that they had.  It’s only, I  turned round, you see I was wondering whether you should buy that little piece or not of the diamond which was not showing at all.  I turned round and there I see this.  I was amazed really.

Yogi: To go shopping with Mother is incredible because

Shri Mataji: Same thing with the saris, have you got the sari with you?

Yogi: The saris must be in Melbourne Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Really.  But the way you got my birthday sari...you can show them

Yogi: Birthday sari

Shri Mataji: No, thats the wedding sari, birthday sari you see what happened we went for buying the saris for international saris business, and you wont believe that I went and asked them have you got these real silk saris.  I mean normally you dont get them. They said we have a bundle you know, we, a real bundle was there and there was eleven saris exactly, one better than the other, and the price was 40% less, 50% less.  We were amazed at the prices and things.  You know the saris cost you nothing short than 6,000 rupees or 5,000, but they got it for 1600, can you believe it.  It’s not even 40%, I dont know what they are up to, and the whole bundle was like that.  They just opened it and Gavin and I just started looking at that, I could believe my own eyes, really it was so, Warren was with us, we all started looking, he opened it and looking at, this, this, this, this, exactly eleven there were.

Yogi: All tied up in a bundle, thats one sari per puja exactly this year.

Shri Mataji: They got it so cheap you cant imagine and I told them no, not more than 2,000 at the most, because I knew they were pure silk.  Silk saris cost that much.  I said alright its 2,000 at the most, not more than that, but it was 1,600, I was outwitted myself.  They said Mother we cant give you a cheap sari internationally for these eleven pujas.  But I am going to stop it now, somehow I am going to have to play some tricks.

Yogi: Yes was that from (unclear Handloom?) House.

Shri Mataji: Yes, and they (unclear Handloom?) House, they gave you saris so cheap you know.

Yogi: They are very very beautiful.

Shri Mataji: For the marriages, so who got them, anyone of you?

Yogi: Molly

Shri Mataji: Yes? She got it? You got it here? which one, what colour yours is?

Yogini: Red one, with a blue border blue and the gold.

Shri Mataji: Ah, yes, she got one.  They are all looking so beautiful, isn’t it and the weddings, I cannot get over it,  isn’t it thats the reason, because that was the last experience you have had.

Yogi: That’s true, tremendous

Shri Mataji: It was tremendous really.  The heavens have come down really.  They are all looking so beautiful, so beautiful,  really like saints.

Yogi: It was like, how, description? The men looked so strong

Shri Mataji: and dignified.  Yes Yes, Angels, absolute angels. Men looked so nice, I mean I cannot describe them the way they came in.  And stood up and so sweet and holding the garlands.  And the whole thing was done in one and a half hours, since they arrived, can you imagine, in one and a half hours, so many marriages, very systematic.

Yogi: Riding the horses, watching them riding the horses was very funny .

Shri Mataji: and the horses, and all that, everything inclusive was three hours. One and a half an hour for them to get out, go round and come back until they did the aarti. And then they came in and when they stood up and the garlands were put in, since then to the end of the marriage was one and a half hours.

Yogi: with the band and everything.

Shri Mataji: And you all danced, I was told, you all danced.  I didn’t see that, I hope there were photographs of that, have you got something recorded Matthew? Of those people who danced? No? It was dark.

Yogi: No he was getting married there,

(Warren is questioned about this) He was also there, he was on the horse

Shri Mataji:yah he was on the horse so he could not dance.

2nd Yogi: ? Was taking some slides Mother.  ? Was taking some slides.

3 Yogi: I will pick a few out and show you perhaps tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: OK tomorrow, I will see tomorrow, thats really good, excellent, yes that would be nice to look at it, just see, I was busy with the girls doing the Gauri puja.

Yogi: Where’s the other one?  Warren is looking for a lost piece of coral!

Everyone laughs.

Shri Mataji: That’s a beauty, I tell you thats a beauty, and its a coral country you know how you get it, in coral all these things we got there. All the rest was all junk.

Yogi: Not only did we get that.  But it was a Sunday, nothings open in India on a Sunday.

Shri Mataji: It’s true, true.

Yogi: Except Indala where this shop happened to have this necklace.

Shri Mataji: Just imagine, nothing is open, thats the only one that is open and we couldn't get anything before, we couldn't order anything, we just didn’t know what to do.  Thank God we did not do because this is the shop we reached and there found this.

Yogi: And to look through all of the junk and to find that.

Shri Mataji: I mean this was placed in all the junks there,  I just turned round he said what? What is the matter?  I said I think there’s something nice somewhere, somewhere I said, let me look, I said,  thats it, look, he couldn't believe his eyes.

So Goodnight, and tomorrow morning we have to resolve, thats its a big campaign we are in here for, we have to save so many of them in Perth and around.  Alright.

Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

The three great mantras are started, but Mother continues,

Shri Mataji: its not how many there are in the ashram, but how many are going to be in the whole of it.  How many are in the ashram is not the main thing.  How many there are altogether.

Three great mantras are sung.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.  May God bless you.  May God bless you,

Good, May God bless you.
