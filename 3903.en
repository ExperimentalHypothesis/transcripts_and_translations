Shri Hamsa Swamini Puja, Grafenaschau (Germany), 10 July 1988.

Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany. We have never yet paid much attention to this center of Hamsa, which is, I think, very important for the Western world, rather than for the Indian or the Eastern. The reason is, at the Hamsa chakra, part of the Ida and Pingala come out and manifest - means the expression of Ida and Pingala is given through the Hamsa chakra.

So this Hamsa chakra is the one that, as if has not gone up to the Agya, but is holding on certain threads or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala. And they start flowing through your nose, expressing through your eyes, from your mouth and from your forehead. So you know that Vishuddhi chakra has got sixteen petals which look after the eyes, nose, throat, tongue, teeth. But the expression part of it comes through the Hamsa chakra, of all these. So it's a very, very important thing in a Western mind, to understand Hamsa chakra. There's a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit, "Hansa kshveta ha, baka ha kshveta ha . ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho. Neera ksheera vivek e tu. Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka ha." Meaning 'The crane and the swan, both are white. And what makes a difference between the two? If you mix the water and the milk together the hamsa (swan) will just suck in the milk. So it can discriminate between the water and the milk while the bakha, means the crane, cannot'. It's a very significant thing for Sahaja Yogis to understand.

Discretion is to be understood very deeply within ourselves. And how we develop discretion is very important in Sahaja Yoga. But before we go to that let us see how this discretion plays a part, very much, in the manifestation of our expressions outside. We are the people, in the West, who always try to express ourselves outside. It's very important how you look, it's very important where you look, what you look at, what you see. It's very important that your appearance should be good. [They are] very particular, they spend lots of time in improving their appearance. This is the minimum. Then they have a method by which we call the Medias. The country speaks or manifests through the Medias. And the Medias have to have a training. Every country has it's specialty one better than the nother. And when you see all of them you find they lack discretion completely. Also in our speech, in our expression of literature, expression of poetry, expression of our relationships with others, any kind of expression, requires discretion which is a deep-seated knowledge or wisdom.

If in the West people were not so much outside, they would have been much better off I think. If, supposing, in England, people don't become punks, then others will laugh at them and they'll think that this man has no money to become a punk. So a kind of a fashion that sets in , in a society of that kind, which has no discretion and which is very outward. Fashions won't work out in countries where they are deeply rooted into traditions and into a proper understanding of life. Of course, the countries which have been very ancient, have been traditionally trying to improve themselves, with error and trial and error and trial methods, have developed much better discretion, much better understanding. But the countries, which have not gone through all that ordeal, have not worked out, have not gone through that discipline, lack in discretion. And that's why many of the people though they are of very deep seeking have gone astray. If they had discretion they would not have gone astray, they would not have gone to wrong places, but the discretion was missing.

So it comes to the discretion how to use your Ida Nadi and Pingala Nadi and discretion to understand what is good and what is bad. Now let us see the Ida Nadi. Ida Nadi is very important because the discretion in this can only come through traditional understanding. Ida Nadi starts from the Ganesha's point - Mooladhara.

So first we miss the biggest support, the biggest help, the biggest nourishment of holiness and auspiciousness, at Mooladhara, if we have no discretion. We always take to a thing, which is detrimental to our growth, and also which may destroy us, not only us but the whole country. We like people who are destructive, when there is no discretion. Discretion means that you must choose the things which are good for you, which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective, which are good for your ascent. On the contrary, the people who have no discretion fall into the traps of wrong type of people like, say, Freud. I mean to an Indian, Freud; nobody can believe that you can go into such an nonsensical idea. But people accepted Freud more than they could accept Christ. Because the discretion was completely missed. If they had that traditional discretion in them, they would have been saved. This traditional discretion is the thing that comes through Ida Nadi. Now that's what the people call 'conditioning' and they say that conditioning is very bad, and people should not take to conditioning and one should be free from conditioning, which is absolutely a wrong idea. In that also there has to be discretion. What conditioning is good and what is not good has to be taken. Now, because there is no discretion about conditioning also; outright discarding all traditions, all that is coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers, everything is discarded. The history is discarded and we say, "Oh, no, we are beyond it, we feel free." Like I was surprised, yesterday, in the plane, somebody told me, "I feel very free when I have no clothes upon myself." I mean if the clothes can imprison you then what happens to the real prisons, what will they be for you? But that sort of a funny idea comes into the head of people and they think that, "We can justify all this stupidity that we follow because we lack discretion." Intelligence cannot give you discretion, it cannot give you discretion as far as the conditioning is concerned. For a Sahaja Yogi it is important to understand how you develop your discretion.

Yesterday only, I gave a very beautiful talk to the ladies of Paris, or I should say ladies of France, regarding the discretion of women. The discretion of the Ida Nadi is intuition. If you develop that discretion within you, through your meditative powers, you develop intuition. And intuition is nothing but the help of the Ganas, which are surrounding you. If you learn to take help from the Ganas you can become very intuitive and without much intelligence of yours you can say the right thing. The whole of Sahaja Yoga, I would say fifty percent at least out of that, is based on intuition.

For that you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh in it's right sense you have to understand. From there it starts because he's Ganapati, he's the one who is the master, is the chief of all the Ganas. So the Ganas give you the intuition. For example, say, I have to go somewhere and then what I say is that 'No, I won't be able to go there tomorrow.' And I won't go somehow. And people think, "Mother, how do You know?" I know, because the Ganas are there and what they say is the truth, they know all about it. Or anything I say about someone comes true.

So they start asking me, "How is it Mother You have come to know about it?" I live on intuition. Like I have to catch a plane I know by intuition what's going to happen. This part has to develop by worshiping Shri Ganesh. So imagine Shri Ganesha also rules a part of the Hamsa chakra. So when we say hum'Hum' and Sa - these two are actually the bija mantras of the Agya. But when the Agya touches the Hamsa it starts here, that's why at the base, at the root of it is the Hamsa. And here, the 'humhumhum' means 'I am'.

If you are discrete you will not take to fashions, you'll not take to stupid ideas. You have your own personality You are a Sahaja Yogi. You don't listen to people who are non-Sahaja Yogis. That is the 'humhum' part - 'I am' - not the ego part. But the 'humhum' - to understand that "I'm a Yogi and I know so many things which normally people don't know and so I have nothing to do with them. I've not to take any lessons from them. They are not to teach me anything. There's nothing that they know, I know much more." To be aware of your Self is 'humhum'.

So that comes from the right side I would say. The discretion of right side is 'hum', and the discretion of left side is 'Sa'. 'Sa' means You. Means 'You are The One'. In your case you know who is the 'You'. But for every human being, 'You' is the Divine. 'You are The One'. This comes from the left side, is 'Sa'. So the word 'Hamsa' is made of two types of discretion where to see 'I am' and where to see 'You are'. On these two balances, as they have shown here beautifully, the Moon and the Sun. In the center is the cross, which gives you the balance, which gives you the dharma. How all these things are connected, one after another, in layers after layers; you can see how dharma is connected with discretion.

Now there are people who are suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual. For example I've seen some Sahaja Yogis, they come to the Puja and they are giving bandhan to themselves like mad. On the way they'll go they'll give bandhan. Anywhere they go they'll give bandhan, like mad. That's just conditioning, that's not discretion that's not Sahaja Yoga. It is to be seen - 'is it to be given bandhan or not?'

In the presence of Mother there is bandhan, what is there to give bandhan to yourself? For people, when I'm talking, are giving bandhan, raising their Kundalini. They're all mad people, I think. Yesterday I heard there's one kind of a music record is played everywhere in the ashrams, because they can all jump like on a camel. It's a music for the camels, you see. Now this record everybody appreciates. Why? Because they can jump like a camel. Once you start jumping like a camel human beings can't give up, they form habits. So they like that particular music, they'll go on jumping like a camel because now they have become camels, they have to behave like camels.

Now if there's something, some music, which is like a horse, like the trot maybe, maybe gallop, anything. Now once they listen to it suddenly they start following that rhythm, now they become the horse, which is galloping. Now if the horse is galloping they become horses and they only like that galloping music. So on and so forth. Could be a donkey, could be anything. We are not animals, we are human beings and we are 'hum' - 'We are'. We are Sahaja Yogis, we are not dominated by any particular type of rhythm or particular type of music. Every variety we can appreciate and understand as long as it is dharmic, as long as it is balancing, as long as it is auspicious and holy. So you can see on the Hamsa how many things are judged. I think the whole of Sahaja Yoga stands on the balance of Hamsa.

There are people who are very astute - means very honest. But this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit. Or else there are people who are very hard working. This can also go to the ridiculous limit. So these qualities, which are supposed to be good, cannot be righteous. The righteousness is discretion glorified. If you have discretion then you glorify that discretion into righteousness. Like, we can take Christ. Christ was such a discretion. When Mary Magdalene was stoned, he had nothing to do with prostitutes, I mean, it's nothing to do at all, no relationship. But he could see in discretion that these people had no business to stone her. He stood up there, in he's own courage, and he said that, "Those who have not committed any sin can throw the stone at me." This is the power of his discretion that people just felt that discretion within themselves and they felt that, in discretion, this man is a holy man and we cannot throw stones at Him. If you are discrete, as Sahaja Yogis, you will make others discrete also. Others will have to be discrete and to understand. And this 'niraksheera vivek' is the differentiation between the water and the milk, the bad and the good, can come to you if you develop that discretion part.

In Sahaja Yoga, at every stage, you'll find people falter, also with the right side indiscretion. And the right side indiscretion comes from the ego manifestation of people. This ego is, as I said, is 'hum'. This ego doesn't work when it has to work. For example I find some people went for a marriage in the church. Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja Yogis, we don't believe in any human religions, you know that. All right, you went to the churches, all right. But they sent a lady to London to buy 'Laura Ashley' dresses. And I think, also, maybe,some men must be wearing tailcoats to do the wedding. Where is that ego lost? That ego that you are a Sahaja Yogi was completely lost. But I think they all went for hairdressing, all kinds of things they did and they all wanted to go there as old Christians walking to the church next to the graves of stupid bishops.

It's not only here, India is much worse. As far as religion is concerned, the left side, they are very, very conditioned people, and there they fail to understand what discretion is. For example, we had Gyanadeva. He was such a great Incarnation and he didn't even have shoes on his feet! And these days they are taking out a big procession of palanquin, so-called shoes in it - of Shri Gyanadeva - and thousands and thousands of people singing praise, just imagine. Who can tell them that, "Gyanadeva had no shoes, what shoes are you carrying in the palanquin?" And whatever village they go to or whatever city they go to, they are fed with sumptuous food; everybody falls at their feet: "The saints have come with a palanquin and the shoes which never belonged to Gyanadeva in it". So this madness goes on.

Now you see all these things happening around you in every country, in every religion, in every stupid area you see all this happening. But you just join hands, you become one with it. And then it becomes so difficult to understand what has happened to you. Now this Ego, when used properly, then it's discretion.

Now also people have another very horrid, horrid conditioning apart from the religion - is of the countries, "I belong to India", "I belong to Germany", "I belong to England." Everything is wretched. I mean, to say something like that means you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara land. Those who start becoming some nationality do not know that your nationality is transformed, actually don't need any passports. In the area where the Divine reigns no passport is needed, it's writ large on your faces. But still inside is deep conditioning is there that, "I belong to this country, my country's very great, your country's not good." But when it comes to discretion is to think that, "All right, I was born in Germany and Germany has made lots of mistakes, let me work it out, so that I get back all my German people into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness." There, this conditioning is used in discretion.

In everything you will find there are two sides. Which way you move is your discretion. For example, there are people who have a conditioning of a particular a religion. Supposing they belong to the Jew religion and have come to Sahaja Yoga or they belong to Christianity and have come to Sahaja Yoga. So now what is the discretion? As soon as another Jew person comes or a Christian person comes in, they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there. And they all become great friends, because "She's Jew, I'm Jew, my father is Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing is Jew". Same with Christians, same with other communities, same with any other nationality. Now, what is the discretion when you see. The best thing, discretion, at that point, is to see what are the faults of these so-called human religions which are formed after the death of the promoters, or we can say the incarnations or the prophets who started the religion. This is first discretion.

The second discretion is to read those scriptures and find out what is so special that these incarnations have said. I would say, if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see what's written in Koran as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned. If it's a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out whatever is written there as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned. Because Sahaja Yoga is the truth, and what truth is written has to be found out. If such a thing is developed, then you can go further, if you are brave enough, and can be courageous, to go and tell the people, that, "See, what is this nonsense you are following? It's not written, it's not done. Whatever is written this is the essence of the whole thing." That's the third stage where you have used your discretion as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned.
Now, when I am in the West, I have to discuss the West. But when I am in India you must hear me! You don't understand the language - it's good for you because you'll lose all respect for Indians. I give them left and right! And tell them what's wrong with them. But here it is important that, much is wrong with us in the West. So the discretion is to see what's gone wrong with us, where are we wrong. Have you got any courage or not. For example, ladies don't have courage to wear a sari outside. Why? Sometimes it doesn't matter. When Indians can wear your dresses you can wear sari also. Or a man won't wear Indian dresses outside. Is a little 'hum' is needed. They enjoy it, but they won't wear. They'll wear the same funny holey pants. They can wear the punky stuff, but they can't wear something that is sensible, is good to wear. It's something that must give you the idea that we are different people.

Now this red mark is very important because then you don't catch any bhoots and has to be worn. In the Bible it's written that there will be a mark on their heads. But because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama Hare Krishna - I don't think they wear any marks - we are frightened of the society how to wear a mark. But supposing they say that you go about with dishevelled hair, we'll do it, because that's allowed in the society.

We are not to be afraid of any society, we have to come out of it and we have to teach them. Whatever is good we are going to do whether you like it or not, that's the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint anywhere, they've gone all out to say whatever is right and whatever is to be done and whatever is to be followed. That's the sign of a saint, otherwise if a saint sometimes gets dissolved into the society, sometimes in Sahaja Yoga, sometimes here, then what's the use of such saints?

Tell me any saint whom you know, who has not fought the society, who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society, in a very loud manner, without any fear. Have you known any saint like that? For Sahaja Yogis it is very important to have that courage within themselves. If you develop your discretion, then it works out.

On the ego side what kind of a discretion you develop and how. On the right side are all the Devas, all the deities sitting around you. You have to understand these deities, you have to know what They are going to do. Supposing, now you are lost on the way. So, you should not think like all other people, "Oh, I'm lost in the way, how will I go there, what will I do?" After all, you are going for some nonsensical work. Doesn't matter. But you must think, "Why? Hanumana, he must have brought me here for some purpose, let's be on the lookout."

Accept it. Accept the situation. When you accept the situation you are playing into the hands of the deities and they are guiding you, your deities are working it out. Accept it. And this acceptance will give you a wonderful discretion over your ego. Whatever goes wrong - "It's all right, we accept it". And above all the vibrations part, which you have to see. If you do something, if the vibrations are going down then of course, "I am a Sahaja Yogi. To me vibrations and my ascent is the most important thing".
So to develop the discretion on the right hand side you have to know your goal, your destination. You must know on what path you are standing and where you are brought, where are you today. You are not like other people. If that kind of a discretion you develop, within yourself, through pure intelligence. For that you need pure intelligence. And pure intelligence in a hamsa (swan) is that it glides on the water, it shrugs [off] the water, it doesn't allow anything to overpower it. It's in the water beautifully beautifying the lakes, also not allowing the lake to dissolve them or to overpower them or to cover them. This is the part where they are 'hum'. If they want they can dive down, if they don't want, they will not. They're gliding on the ocean, ocean of Samsara, of this Bhavasagara and they are not going to be drowned into it. That is the 'hum' part of it which you should have, the discretion. On the one side you should accept things that come to you.

The best among these was Shri Krishna, I would say, who had real discretion. But, after all, he was Shri Krishna. But his methods were so interesting of discretion that it's enjoyable to know about how he destroyed so many rakshasas. Every time he did not use his Sudarshan chakra, he used his discretion. Like there was a rakshasa who was trying to overpower the Pandavas, who was trying to overpower the people who were good. Shri Krishna said, "Now, what to do with this horrible fellow." And this fellow had boons from Brahmadeva and from Mahadeva and everyone. So Shri Krishna was in the center, after all, so he wanted to organize a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa. So what he did, that there was a great right sided saint meditating, and he had taken a boon that, "Nobody should disturb me, at least the one who disturbs me for the first time, I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person". And this one was meditating in a cave. Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away from the battlefield. His name is Ranchordas. It's a little bit derogatory to say to somebody that 'The one who ran out of the battlefield'.

So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield. But there was no other way out to kill this horrible fellow. And he went and he was covering Himself with a shawl, he went into that cave and covered that saint with his shawl. After Shri Krishna was running [away from] this horrible rakshasa, to kill him, Shri Krishna went and hid Himself. When this rakshasa came near the cave and he saw the shawl covering this saint. He said, "Oh, so now you are tired and sleeping here, running away from the field! Get up now!" As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him and he was completely burnt away.

So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata, at his feet;or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on his head, in between the two resides Hamsa chakra. The discretion is very beautifully described in the life of Shri Krishna. We can call Him that he had a naughty way of using his discretion. He has done so many things like that. But they create a drama, they create his Leela. Because he was 'Leela' that's why he could use his discretion to create a drama or play.

So on one side we have the help of Shri Krishna to give us the discretion, and on the other side we have Christ. In between is placed this Hamsa. So we have two great incarnations within us who are the embodiment of discretion. So one side is Shri Krishna who is the one who looks after the conditioning side of it. And on the other side is Christ who starts looking after the ego side of it. The One who says on the cross, "Oh, God, forgive them because they do not know. Oh, Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing." Is the same One Who takes a hunter in his hand and hits people, starts beating them, because they are making money in the name of God. See the discretion. That's Jesus. Same Shri Krishna, Who with his Sudarshan chakra can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasas, becomes the driver of Arjuna. The contrast of their behavior is the beautiful saga of Their discretion.

Now for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to understand that they have to work out their discretion in a manner that they develop their intuition. I would say the first thought could be the intuition, could be the intuition. "Could be that this is intuition". Try, experiment. But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja Yoga, you have to do everything in moderation.Like I told them to see everything through vibrations. So they will put their hands, I don't know, to everything. "Should I buy this sari or not?" Even go beyond that. "Should I buy this face powder or not?" It's so ridiculous, is so bad, that ultimately you find you have become a bhoot and you are telling everybody that your vibrations are bad, because your vibrations are bad. Your attention is bad. Putting your attention to nonsensical things makes your vibrations absolutely disappear.

So, with discretion you must have common sense, practical sense. I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody about Sahaja Yoga. No, it's not practical. Sahaja Yoga is a precious diamond, you cannot give it to every person. I've seen people at the airport raising Kundalini of everyone. No, it's not meant, they have to come to Sahaja Yoga, they have to ask for it, they have to beg for it, then only they can get their Realization. We don't want quantity, we want quality. All My lectures if you see, in that, I've been insisting on the quality of Sahaja Yogis and the quality of the seekers. But when we start thinking of getting a majority for a vote for Shri Mataji - I have to say that I'm not standing for any election. Whether you elect me or not I'm elected. You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that. And when you fail in discretion you find some problems develop.

Now, it is for you to find out what indiscrete things you have done, where have you gone wrong, in which way have you done a mistake. It is for you to find out, then rectify it. Otherwise in Sahaja Yoga there should be no problems, there should be no ordeals, there should be all joy and joy and joy. But the discretion should be to find out what are your weaknesses, where have you done wrong, what's gone wrong, where, in what part and how we have failed.

Sometimes people think, "Oh, we did a lot at that time, now we can't do it". Then you have failed. Like I heard that people are saying, "Now we have come here, so we'll not go to Guru Puja" it's wrong, it's very wrong, we have to come to Guru Puja, no question. Guru Puja is the one puja you cannot miss. Even if you miss Sahasrara is alright, but Guru Puja is very important. At any cost you have to come for Guru Puja.

I know I chose a place, which is Andorra, but it's not Himalayas! Now Sahaja Yoga is so comfortable that we want that there should be no change of flights, directly we'll sit on a hamsa and arrive. You will, you'll see that. But if you are developing the habit of thinking, "Oh, it would be difficult", then it will be[?]. But as Mother has said it, it is going to be the easiest. Everything is going to work out." Once you think like that, everything will work out. But first there should be pure desire to do it. Whenever such ideas come into your head, again use your discretion.

We go to Guru Puja for our own health. Every Guru Puja, if you remember, you have come up very much higher. Every Guru Puja has helped you. Of course you say that Maharashtra Tour is very good, I agree, it is, Maharashtra Tour helps you a lot. But that's for thirty days, so intensive. But Guru Puja is only one day. How many pujas you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine, sometimes even ten. That's why, naturally it has to be much more effective. But Guru Puja itself is extremely effective. Indians have been asking me, "Mother, once, at least once more, give us the Guru Puja. We'll give anything to have a Guru Puja. Please come." This time they wanted to have a Guru Puja. Imagine! You could not have attended Guru Puja in India. But with Andorra I have a special purpose, I have a special purpose. So please understand, I am not a purposeless personality. Gradually you will learn how I fulfill the purpose - yours, Mine and that of Sahaja Yoga, together. How I work it out beautifully, you will understand and I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful ways and methods of discretion by which you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing!

Now for the treatment of Hamsa chakra, which is more on the physical side, is outside, that's why it has to be much more on the physical side also. So as we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well, to put the Hamsa chakra alright. Also for Hamsa chakra it's important not to kiss people. I think kissing must be given up, because in kissing you do allow the germs of another person, in Sahaja Yoga it's alright. But once I say that, that doesn't mean you go all crazy with the kissing. No, not proper. If, in India, you go and kiss somebody he'll just be stunned, he'll not know what is happening.

The more you start expressing your love by all these gestures the less it is inside. Now for example, there's a method of expressing "Thank you". I mean, you go on saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you." It's just a lip-service. But many people in many countries don't say "thank you" at all, but they are very grateful inside. The gratefulness inside, creates the depth that is necessary. So to do it superficially, anything, too much, has to be avoided in your discretion.

But avoiding extremes, avoiding too much outward expression, again, can create another indiscretion like the English, they don't speak, they just don't speak. You travel with them every day for twenty-five miles, sitting together; they will not say who you are. They'll know each and everything about you, but they'll just keep quiet. They are not supposed to speak, it's artificial.

So the second point we have to come to - we are not to be artificial. It's alright, if somebody feels like, just out of just spontaneity wants to love me and hug me, I don't mind, because it's not artificial, it just comes. Children are most spontaneous, they not artificial, they are not at all artificial. In the same way we have to be very natural about everything. It's alright, while talking to each other, if the men hit the men a little bit, doesn't matter. They have not insulted, it's a love, expression of love, is alright. But should be spontaneous, should not be artificial. We should not take to artificiality in Sahaja Yoga, at all, by any chance.

But wearing clothes is not artificiality. To be decent is not artificiality. To be dignified is not artificiality. Artificiality is that, what you don't feel inside, is to say out. That is artificiality and for a Sahaja Yogi, he feels he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness, he has that protocol and he respects his body. Out of respect of the body he doesn't want to do something that will insult his body. And that's how if you understand how far to go and how far to stop.

Then there is another way of indiscretion in Sahaja Yoga, which I have seen, is that people start using me for many purposes like that. Like, supposing, now somebody's writing a poem. So he'll come to me, he'll, "Please correct my poem." I'll correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems, then he will lose the capacity to produce poems.

You should not use me for your own purpose in that manner, but in any case you are using me. But with an understanding that "Mother is all the time with me and is helping me," there's no need to come forward and jump on My time and to take My time and to bother me so that I should feel, "O God, when will I get rid of this?" Or others have a thing, "Mother, You must come to my house, You must take my child, You must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard." So taking attention to what you call "yours" is also indiscretion.

Instead of that you put your attention to me instead of taking My attention to you. It's a very delicate line, as if we are walking on a sword. It's a very, very delicate line of discretion. But once you know as a state within yourself, you are discrete; you cannot be indiscrete even if you want to be. And that is what is the ascent part.

So once you come out of this chakra and pass through your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara where you have to be discrete. Whatever then comes out from there - blessed, whatever expression comes out - blessed, from the Sahasrara is all discrete and beautiful.

Some people have a habit of dominating me also. Like, if I'm talking, they'll talk inbetween. If I am saying something - they will come forward. Then I play tricks, I'm good at playing tricks. But I'm very discrete, so it's alright. My discretion plays the tricks. Because if I am direct you won't like it, so better to be discrete and play tricks.

In everything that we do discretion expresses itself and if you are a solid Sahaja Yogi or a Sahaja Yogini your discretion is evident and everybody sees it and knows it, that it is there. So for all of you it is important to develop your discretion today and to ask me to reside in your Hamsa chakra so that you are all the time stationed in the power of discretion. With discretion we have evolved to the human state and to go further we have to develop our innate discretion which I think is the essence of all the religions, of all the adventures we have had, of all the lives which we have known, is the discretion around which everything moves.

May God bless you all. May God bless you all.

I felt that I've fallen into the depths of joy, into the ocean of joy. So beautiful it was, that you all could come and give me such a surprise. Of course I love you very much, no doubt.

My love is not mental, is not emotional, it's existence itself. I exist with it. It's my innate nature, which I could not enjoy unless and until it is reflected. It has to be reflected and today I felt the reflection in you people. I was so overjoyed, so very overjoyed. Everything seems so beautiful.

All these petty problems that trouble you and sometimes try to bother me also just disappeared. You just felt that everybody is so cleansed and so beautiful, everybody's ego washed off and the nectar of the beauty of love is just pouring into them. It's not easy to describe, that was Nirananda, I felt, today, complete Nirananda. To feel Your own joy reflected is something so boundless that You cannot put them into the limitations of words. You have given me the greatest joy today and a very great feeling that Sahaja Yoga now will be established very well in Germany especially.

I always felt about Germany that it needed a special help and the way you all have rushed here is something like a place,say in the hand or in the feet, or there's some pain, so all the attention moves towards that, like that. Germany is a very strong nation and if you could take them to Sahaja Yoga we'll have that metal within us. It's very important. Every country has something special. The metal of Germany is very important and if that comes into us, we'll have that courage. So may God bless you all for that. May God bless you.

(Later on.......)

Alright, one, I'll speak for a five minutes.

In a way our European tour has now come up to Germany, up to Munich and it has to spread out to other parts of Germany, is very essential. Specially in Bavaria, as I've heard, there's a lot of orthodoxy and also an influence of the Catholic Church. So it was necessary to start the German center in Bavaria, in Munich. But I'm so happy the way you all have come here and the way we have worked it out, that we have really changed the vibrations of this place. When I came here I felt the vibrations were not so good, and many other people have used this place I was told. But I find you all have changed the vibrations and things are much better here. That's how, the more you travel, the more you go, the more you talk to people, the better it is, for them, to see how vibrations change and to feel the goodness of the saints coming in their own glory. And the saints are recognized by the change of the atmosphere.

Now I was thinking about when you are going to Andorra. So many of you will be going by buses, and you can, on your buses, have big posters put up or maybe banners put up. You can have the photographs, you can wear the badges, you can stop at some village, some place, talk to people, sing the song, all that will change the atmosphere all the way, wherever you travel. Now the time to keep quite has gone. Now we have to talk, we have to sing, we have to show that we are quite capable people and that we can express ourselves beautifully, in a dignified manner. For example, it's nice when we are together in privacy under a beautiful tent like this. We can dance, we can enjoy ourselves. But when we are outside, facing the public, we have to sing, but with dignity. That's the discretion part of it. And here we have to all enjoy among themselves, jumping, laughing, everything is there.

But the outside world thinks that a saint should be a very serious personality. Even to me they said, "Mother, is there any photograph where You are not smiling?" I said, "I don't know, maybe some of them, quite angry also sometimes." So, I said, "Why?" "Because in America nobody likes a saint to smile". I said, "Really? Is it, that all the rest of the people should smile and enjoy and the saint should sit sulking, is that what they expect a saint to do?" Saint should be the one who should be smiling and laughing. But they haven't come to that stage of understanding that the joy is the right of a saint and not of an ordinary person.

So we need not look sulking and unhappy, but we need not be very exuberant with our expressions. So this is how things will work out. But I love to see you dancing and enjoying, your body rippling with vibrations and everything feeling so nice, it looks so nice and everything you can express through your own body, the joy that you are feeling. Despite all that sometimes we find that there are some people who cannot get over their sickening unhappiness, and they look so funny and absurd in a group of people who are so joyous.

So I have to warn all of you because I had a case of a lady who was from India and she was married; her husband was a very fine man, very happy person, very joyous and a good person. But this lady refused to assimilate herself with that group, with that society, with everything and she just kept out, all the time, and was trying to show that she was very unhappy, she could not mix up, she could not be collective. As a result she had to go back. She has created a problem for me but still she can't get over her stupid ideas about her so-called unhappiness, so-called separation from her family maybe, or so-called calamities, which are no more for a Sahaja Yogi.

So I have to request you that - come to your joyous condition. Be happy, that you are in that condition. Thank God that nonsense of unhappiness is gone. That is how you can see so many miracles, you can see so many good things happening in your life. But if you are a crying baby and if you are always complaining and you look so miserable as if the whole world is falling upon you, then the whole world will fall, you have asked for it, alright, have it.

You see, all the Ganas are waiting to do what you want. Now, you want misery? Alright, have it. On a plate they'll give you the miseries. But if you want to be happy they are there to make you happy. So it's important for you to understand that we have to be very, very happy, joyous people, welcoming what Sahaja Yoga has given us and not to be serious, unhappy, complaining, nonsensical. You are above all these things. If we cannot rise above this then, what will happen is that you'll go down, down, and down, and down.

I love to see all the Sahaja Yogis enjoying music, dancing, singing because you are in another world. You have got rid of all that was nonsensical, all that is fallen off now. If it has not fallen, that means you need more maturity, you have to come up. If you are still serious, thinking "what? This, that," then you require some more meditation, shoe-beating, all kinds of things. You have to treat yourself. But you have to be in joy, all the time in joy.

In joy you do not have unhappiness or happiness; it's just joy, absolute joy. I cannot keep Myself even serious for more than one minute, I try to be serious but it's difficult because so much joy is bubbling all the time, that I find it difficult to show that I'm not very happy or I'm angry.

So I would request you to be completely lost in the ocean of joy. Give up all your conditionings, all your nonsensical ideas but just be joyous and be happy with yourself and with all the rest of the Sahaja Yogis and with me.

So this is the greatest discretion, today, we have to learn is to be joyous and happy. Are we happy, are we joyous or are we complaining? If you are complaining, if you are sitting like this, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. If you don't how to smile and laugh, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi, absolutely, whatever you may say, you are not a Sahaja Yogi. You must always have a smile on your face all the time and you should be happy people. Not artificially, but from within. If you are not felt it as yet better go into meditation, work it out, see that you don't feel guilty, see that you don't feel unhappy.

Now those who feel unhappy among you please raise your hands (All are laughing, including Shri Mataji). Thank you for this. Ah, alright.

Nothing like laughing. Laughs is a greatest correction, you'll laugh at yourself, you'll laugh at others. Don't make others look ridiculous, but just enjoy the way others are and enjoy each other. They are all very beautiful people, very beautiful, it's like one beautiful flower is enjoying the fragrance of another beautiful flower. That's what should be. One should not feel, that, "Oh, look at this flowerit's so beautiful." Look at yourself, you are so beautiful too. But unless and until you enjoy the fragrance and the beauty of another flower, you cannot know what you are, because you are all just the same inside, you are all people who's Spirit has come into their attention, wonderful people, certified Yogis. See, you all have got the light on your head, if you want to see, we have a photograph to show that you are certified Yogis and on top of your head, all of you there's the light. So you're already certified by every camera that you are Yogis. Now whatever you may try it is so, you're already certified. So for certified people it's not proper to take other certificates.

May God bless you all.

(Shri Mataji sings along with Sahaja Yogis for some 6 minutes)

What a raga! It is a Hansadhwani

I must say I used to sing much better than this, but you see, if you go on giving lectures you can't sing. You have to get get to one thing and that's what has happened. But this raga is Hansadhwani. Today is the Hamsa's thing and this is Hansadhwani. Dhwani means the sound of Hamsa.

Ah. I'm just making fun of Indian people who who try to sing bhajan in the villages, you see and they will sing one sentence which has no meaning at all, you see, like "Vitthala to barawa", means, "Shri Krishna Who is good". Again, "Shri Krishna is good", he's good after all, and what's the use of singing again. That's all, you see, they cannot tribute to Him. All of them singing this for hours together! "Vitthala to barawa, Vitthala to barawa". In everything they'll sing that. So I was thinking what's the matter with these people, from where did they get this word "barawa"? Maybe some poet who's name must have been Baraway, so he has given this barawa, barawa. But I think things will improve now when they will see the way you sing, they will improve.

(Shri Mataji along with Sahaja Yogis sings Bhavani Dayani)

In this small song how much they have said, so many things. "amara pada dani". That "She gives you the status, which is indestructible, the position, which cannot be destroyed" - "amara pada", "the highest". That's the description of the Goddess and that's what you have got.

May God bless you all.

So we have to thank the people of Germany have organized this program so well, so beautiful. (Applause) Also we have to thank all the musicians from Switzerland (Applause) who stayed back and have brought such color to the all ending program. These are all very memorable moments, so very beautiful. I hope you all will carry the peace and the joy that you have imbibed within yourself here. We have to thank all these people who have worked so hard to prepare such beautiful presents for you and for me. Also we must better thank the nature and atmosphere which was very kind to us.
