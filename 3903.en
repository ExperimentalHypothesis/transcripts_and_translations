Hamsa Chakra Puja, Grafenschau (Germany), 10 July 1988.

Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany. We have never yet paid much attention to this center of Hamsa which is, I think, very important for the Western world rather than for the Indian or the Eastern. The reason is, at the Hamsa Chakra part of the Ida and Pingala come out and manifest. It means the expression of Ida, Pingala is given through the Hamsa Chakra. So this Hamsa Chakra is the one, as it has not gone up to the Agnya, but is holding on certain threads or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala, and they start flowing toward your nose, expressing through your eyes, from your mouth and from your forehead. So you konw that Vishuddi Chakra has got sixteen petals which look after the eyes, nose, throat, tongue, teeth, but the expression part comes through the Hamsa Chakra, of all these. So, it`s a very, very important thing in a Western mind to understand Hamsa Chakra. There`s a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit.
Hansa shvetaha, bakaha shvetaha, ko vedo, hansa bakayaho,
Nirkshir viveketu, hansa hansha, baka bakaha.
Meaning the crane and the swan both are white. And what makes the difference between the two? If you mix the water and the milk together, the Hamsa will just suck in the milk. So it can discriminate between the water and the milk. While, the bakaha, means the crane, cannot. It`s a very significant thing for Sahaja Yogis to understand. Discretion is to be understand very deeply within ourselves, and how we develop disretion is very important in Sahaja Yoga. But before we go to that, let us see how this descretion plays a part very much in the manifestation of our expressions outside.

We are the people in the West, who always try to express ourselves outside. It`s very important how you look, it`s very important where you look, what you look, what you see, It`s very important that your appearance should be good. Very particular. They spend lots of time in improivng their appearances. This is the minimum. Then they have a method by which we call the medias. The country speaks. or manifests through the medias. And the medias have to have a training. Every country has its speciality, one better than the other. And when you see all of them, you find they lack discretion completely. Also, in our speech, in our expression of literature, expression of poetry, expression of our relationships with other. Any kind of expression requires discretion, which is a deep seated knowledge or wisdom. If, in the West, people were not so much outside, they would have been much better off, I think. If, supposing, in England, people don`t become punks, then others will laugh at them. And they`ll think that this man has no money to become a punk. So a kind of a fashion that sets in a society of that kind which has no discretion and which is very outward. Fashions won`t work out in countries where they are deeply rooted into traditions, and into proper understanding of life. Of course, the countries which have beeen very ancient have been traditionally trying to improve themselves with error and trial, and error and trial methods have developed much better descretion, much better understanding. But the countries which are not gone through all that ordeal have not worked out, have not gone through all that discipline lack in descretion. And that`s why many of the people, though they are of very deep seeking, have gone astry. If they had descretion they would not have gone astray, they would not have gone to wrong places. But the descretion was missing.

So it comes to the discretion how to use your Ida nadi and Pingala nadi, and discretion to understand what is good and what is bad. Now let us see the Ida nadi. Ida nadi is very important because the discretion in this can only come through traditional understanding. Ida nadi starts from the Ganesha`s point, Mooladhara. So first, we miss the biggest support, the biggest help, the biggest nourishment of holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara if we have not discretion. We always take the thing which is detrimental to our growth and also which may destroy us, not only us, but the whole country. We like people who are destructive when there is no discretion.
Discretion means that you must choose the things which are good for you. which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective, which are good for your ascent. On the contrary, the people who have no discretion fall into the traps of wrong type of people. Like say, Freud. I mean, to an Indian, Freud, nobody can believe that you can go to such
a nonsensical idea. But people accepted Freud more than they could accept Christ because the discretion was completely missing. If they had that traditional discretion in them they would have been saved. It is that traditinal discretion is the thing that comes through Ida nadi.
Now that`s what the people call it as conditioning, and they say that conditioning is very bad, and people should not take to conditioning, and one should be free from conditioning, which is absolutely a wrong idea. In that also there has to be discretion. What conditioning is good and what is not good has to be taken. Now because there is no discretion about conditioning also, outright discarding all tradition. all that is coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers, everything is discarded, the history is discarded, an we say, Oh, no, we are beyond it, we feel free. Like I was surprised, yesterday, in the plane somebody told me, I feel very free when I have no clothes upon myself. I mean, if the clothes can imprison you, then what happens to the real prisons, what will thy be for you? But that sort of a funny idea comes into the head of people and they thin that we can justfy all this stupidity that we follow because we lack discretion. Intelligence cannot give you discretion. It cannot give you discretion as far as the conditioning is concerned. For the Sahaja Yogi it is important to understand how you develop your discretion. Yesterday only I gave a very beautiful talk to the ladies of Paris, or, I should say, the ladies of France, regarding the discretion of women.

The discretion of the Ida Nadi is intuition. If you develop that  discretion within you, through your meditative power, you develop intuition. And intuition is nothing but is the help of the Ganas which are surrounding you. If you learn to take help from the Ganas you can become very intuitive, and without much intelligence of yours, you can say the right thing. The whole of Sahaja Yoga, I would say fifty percent at least out of that is based on intuition. For that you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh in its right sense you have to understand. From there starts because He is Ganapate, He is the one who is the master, He`s the chief of all the Ganas. So the Ganas give you the intuition. For example, say I have to go somewhere, and then What I say is that, No, I won` be able to go there tomorrow. And won`t go, somehow. Then people think, Mother, how do you kow? I know because the Ganas are there and what they say is the truth, they know all about it. Or anything I say about someone comes true. So they start asking me, How is it, Mother you have com to know about it? I live on intuition. Like I have to catch a plane, I know by intuition, what`s going to happen. This part has to develop by worshipping Shri Ganesh.

So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules a parft of the Hamsa Chakra. So when we say Ham and Sa, these two are actually the Bija Mantras of the Agnya. But when the Agnya touches the Hamsa it starts here. That`s why at the base, at the root of it is the Hamnsa. And here the Ham (Ham means, "I am.") If you are descret, you will not take to fashions, you`ll not take to stupid ideas. Yoou have your own personality, you are a Sahaja Yogi. You don`t listen to people who are non-Sahaja Yogis. That is the  Ham part, I am. Not the ego part, but the Ham to understand that, "I am a Yogi, and I know so many things which normaly people don`t konw and so I have nothing to do with them. I`ve not to take any lessons from them.  They`re not o teach me anything. There`s nothing that they know. I know much more." To be aware of yourself is Ham. So that comes from the right side, I would say.

The discretion of right side is Ham, and the discretion of the left side is Sa. Sa means `You`, means `you are the one.` In your case, you know who is the `you`. But for every human being, You is the Divine. `You are the one.` This comes from the left side, is Sa. So the word, Hamsa, is made of two types of discretion, where to see `I am`, and where to see `You are`. On these two balances, as they are shown here beautifully, the moon and the sun, in the center is the cross which gives you the balance, which gives you the dharma. How all thes things are connected one after another, layers after layers, you can see. How dharma is connected with discretion.

Now, there are people who are suddenly enticed by some sort of ritual. For example, I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, they comee to the puja and they are giving bandhans to them like mad. On the way they`ll go, they`ll give bandhans. Anywhere they go they`ll give bandhan, like mad. That`s just conditioning, that`s not discretion, that`s not Sahaja Yoga. It is to be seen, is it to be given bandhan or not? In the presence of Mother there is bandhan. What is there to give bandhan to yourself? But people, when I am talking, are giving bandhan, raising their Kundalini. They`re all mad people, I think. In the same way, there are people, yesterday, I heard there`s one kind of a music record is played everwhere in the ashrams, because they can all jump like on a camel, it`a music for the camels, you see. Now, this record everbody appreciates. Why? Because they can jump like a camel. Once you start jumping like a camel, human being can`t give up, they form habits. So they like that particaular music. They will go on jumping like a cvamel because now they have become camels, they have to behave like camels. Now if maybe a gallop, anything. Now once they listen to it, suddenly they start following that rhythm. Now they become the horse which is galloping. Now the horse is galloping. They become horses, and they ony like that galloping music. So on and so forth, could be a donkey, could be anything.
We are not animals, we are human being, and we are Ham, `We Are,` we are Sahaja Yogis. We are not dominated by any particular type of rhythm, or particular type of mujsic. Every variety we can appreciate and understand, as lang as it is dharmic, as long as it is balanced, as long as it is auspicious and holy. So you can see on the Hamsa, how many things are judged. I thin the whole of Sahaja Yoga stand on the balance of Hamsa. There are people who are very astute, means very honest, but this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit. Or else, there are poeple who are very hard working. This can also go to the ridiculous limit. So these qualities which are supposed to be good, caanot be righteous. The righteousness is discretion, glorified.
If you have discretion, then you glorify that discretion into righteousness. Like you can say now, Christ, you can take Christ. Christ was such a discretion. When Mary Magdalene was stoned, He had nothing to do with prostitute, I mean, nothing to do at all, no relationship, but He could see, in discretion, that these people had no business to stone her, He stood up there, in His own courage, and He said that, `Those who have not commited any sin can throw the stone at Me.` This is the power of His descretion, that people just felt hat discretion within themselves, and they felt that in discretion, `This man is a Holy man and we can not throw stones at Him.` If you are discret as Sahaja Yogis, you will make others discret also. Others will have to be discret and to understand. And this `Nirakshi vivek` is the differentiation between the water and the milk, the bad and the good, can come to you if you develop that discretion part.

In Sahaja Yoga, at every stage you`ll find people falter also with the right side indiscretion. An the right side indiscretion comes from the ego manifestation of people. This ego, as I said, is Ham. This ego doesn`t work when it has to work out. For example, I find some people went for a marriage in the church. Of course, that`s wrong for Sahaja Yogis. We don`t believe in any human religions, you kow that. All right, you went to the church, it`s all right. But they sent a lady to London to buy Laura Ashley dresses, to buy, and I think also, maybe some men must be wearing tail coats to do the wedding. Where is that ego lost? That ego that you are a Sahaja Yogi was completely lost. I think they all went for hair dressing, all kinds of things they did, and they all wanted to go there as old Christians, walking to the church next to the graves of stupid bishops.
It`s not only here, India is much worse, as far as religion is concerned, the left side, they are very, very conditioned people, and there they fail to understand what is discretion. For example, we had Jnanadeva, he was such a great incarnation, and he didn`t even have shoes on his feet. And these days they are taking out a big procession of palanquin, so-called shoes in it of Shri Jnanadeva, and thousands and thousands of people singing praise. Just imagine! Who can tell them that Jnanadeva had no shoes! What shoes are you carrying in the palanquin? And whichever village they go or whatever city they go, they are fed with sumpuous food, everybody falls at their feet.  ~The saints have come with a planquin.` And the shoes never belonged Jnanadeva in it.
So this madness goes on. Now you see all these things happening aroud you. In very country, in every religion, in every stupid area, you`ll see all this happening. But you just join hands. You become one with it and then it becomes so difficult to understand what has happened to you. Now this ego, when used properity, then is discretion. Now also, people have another very, very horrid conditioning, apart from the religion, is of the countries. `I belong to India, I belong to Germany, I belong to England.` Everything is wretched! I mean, to say something like that means you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara Land. Those who start becoming some nationality do not know that your nationality  is transformed. Actually, you don`t need any passports in the area where the Divine reigns, no passport is needed. It`s written large on your faces. But still, inside, this deep conditioning is there, that `I belong to this country. My country is very great. Your country`s not good.` But when it comes to discretion is to thin that,`All right I was born in Germany, and Germany has made lots of mistakes. Let me work it out. So that I get back all my German people into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness. There is this conditioning is used in discretion. In everything you will find there are two sides. Which way you move is your discretion.
For example, there are people who have a conditiong, of a particular, say, a religion. Supposing they belong to the Jew religion, and have come to Sahaja Yoga or they belong to Christianity and have come to Sahaja Yoga. So now, what is the discretion? As soon, as another Jew person comes or a Christian person comes in they`ll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there, and they`ll all become great friends. `Because she`s Jew, I`m Jew, my father is Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing is Jew.` Same with Christians, same with other communities, same with any other nationality.
Now what is the discretion when you seek? The best thing, discretion at that point is to see what are the faults of these so-called human religions which are formed after the death of the promoters, or, we can say, the incarnations or the prophets who started the religion? This is first discretion. The second discretion is to read those scriptures and find our what is so special that these incarnations have said. For I would say, if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see what`s written in Koran as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned. If it`s a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out whatever is written there as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned, because Sahaja Yoga is the truth, and what truth is written has to be found out. If such a thing is developed, then you can go further, if yhou are brave enough, and can be courageous to go and tell the people, that, `See, what is this nonsense you are following? Itr`s not written, it`s not done. Whatever is written, this is the essence of the whole thing.` That`s the third stage, where you have used your discretion as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned.

Now when I am, say, in tghe West, I have to discuss the West. But when I am in India, you must hear Me. You don`t understand the language, is good for you. Because you lose all respect for the Indians, I give them left and right, and tell them what`s wrong with them. But here it is important hat, much is wrong with us in the West. So the discretion is to see what`s gone wrong with us. Where are we wrong? Have we got any courage or not?
For example, ladies don` have courage to wear a sari outside. Why? Sometimes doesn`t matter. When Indians can wear your dresses, you can wear saris also. Or the men won`t wear Indian dresses outside, is a little Ham is needed. They enjoy it, but they won`t wear it. They`ll wear the same funny holy pants. They can wear the punky stuff, but thy can`t wear something that is sensible, is good to wear. It`s something that must give you the idea that we are different people. Now this red mark is very important, because then you don`t catch any bhoots and has to be worn. In the Bible it is written that there will be a mark on their heads, but because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama Hare Krishna, I don`t think they`ll wear any marks, we are frighted of the society. How to wear a mark? But supposing they say that, `You will go about with a disheveled hair,` you`ll do it, because that`s allowed in the society.
We are the people who are not to be afraid of any society. We have to come out of it and we have to teach them. whatever is good we are going to do whether you like it or not. That`s the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint, anywhere, they have gone all out to say whatever is right, whatever is to be done, and whatever is to be followed. That`s the sign of a saint. Otherwise your saint sometimes gets dissolved in the society, sometimes in Sahaja Yoga, sometimes here. Then what`s the use of such saints? Tell me any saint who you know who has not fought the society, who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society, in a very loud manner, without any fear? Have you kown any saint like that?
For Sahaja Yogis, it is very important to have that courage within themselves. If you develop your discretion, then it works out. On the ego side what kind of a discretion you develop, and how? On the right side are all the Devas, all the Deities sitting around you. You have to understand these Deities. You have to know what they are going to do. Supposing, now, you are lost on the way. So, you should not think like all other people, `Oh, I am lost on the way. How will I go there? What will I do?` After all you are going for some nonsensical work. It doesn`t matter. But you must think, `Why, Hanumana, He must have brought me here for some purpose. Lit`s be on the look-out.` Accept it, accept the situation. When you accept the situation, you are playing into the hands of the Deities, and they are guiding you. Your Deities are working it out. Accept it! And this acceptance will give you a wonderful discretion over yhour ego. Whatever goes wrong, it`s all right. We accept it.
And above all, the vibrations part, which you have to see. If you do something, if vibrations are going down, then of course, `I am a Sahaja Yogi, to me vibrations and my ascent is the most important thing.` So to develop the discretion on the right-hand side, you have to konw your goal, your destination. You must know on what path you`re standing and where you are brought. Where are you today? We are not like other people. If that kind of a discretion you develop within yourself through pure intelligence -for that you need pure intelligence. And pure intelligence in a Hamsa is that it glides on the water. It shunts the water. It doesn`t allow anything to overpower it. It`s in the water beautifully, beautifying the lake, also not allowing the lake to dissolve them, or to overpower them or cover them. This ist the part where they are Ham. If they want, they can dive down. If they don`t want, they will not. They are gliding on the ocean, ocean of the Samsara, of this Bhava Sagara, and they`re not going to be drowned into it. That is the Ham part of it, which you should have the discretion.
On the one side you should accept things, that they come to yuou. The best among these was Shri Krishna, I would say, who had real discretion. But after all, He was Shri Krishna. But His methods werde so interesting, of discretion, that is enjoyable to know about how He destroyed so many rakshasas. Every time He did not use His Sudarshana Chakra, He used His disretion. Like there was a rakshasa the people who were good. Shri Krishna said, `Now, what to do with this horrible fellow?` And this fellow had boons from Brahmadeva and Mahadeva and everyone, so Shri Krishna`s in the center, after all. So He wanted to organize a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa. So, what He did, that there was a great, right-sided saint meditating, and He had taken a boon that, `nobody should disturb me. At least, the one who disturbs me for the first time, I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person.` And this one was meditating in a cave. Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away from the battlefield. His name is Ranchoddas. It`s a little bit derogatory okay, to say somebody, that the one who ran out of the battlefield. So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield, for there was no way out to kill this horrible fellow. And He went, and He was covering Himself with a showl. He went into that cave, and covered that saint with His shawl. After Shri Krishna went and hid Himself. When this rakshasa came near the cave and he saw the shawl covering this saint. He said, `Oh, so now you are tired und sleeping here, running away from the field! Get up now!` As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him, and he was completely burnt away.
So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata, at His feet, or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on His head, in between the two resides Hamsa Chakra. The discretion is very beautifully described in the life of Shri Krishna. We can call him that he had a naughty way of using his discretion. He has done so many things like that, but they create a drama, they create His Leela. Because He was Leela, that`s why he could use his discretion to create a drama, a play. So on one side we have the help of Shri Krishna to give us the discretion, and on the other side we have Christ. In between is placed this Hamsa. So we have two great incarnations within us, who are the embodiment of discretion. So one side is Shri Krishna who is the one who looks aftger the conditioning side of it. An the another side is Christ who starts looking after the ego side of it. The one who says, on the cross, `Oh God, forgive them because they do not know. Oh Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.` is the same one who takes a hunter in His hand and hits people, starts beating them because they are making money in the name of God. Seee the Sudarshana Chakra can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasa, become the driver of Arjuna. The contrast of their behavior is the beautiful saga of their discretion.
Now for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to understand that they have to work out their discretion in a manner that they develop their full intuition. I would say the first thought could be the intution, could be the intuition. Could be that this is intuition. Try. Experiment. But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja Yoga, you have to do everything in moderation. Like, I told them to see, everthing through vibartions, to they will put their hands, I don`t know, to everything. `Should I buy this face powder or not?` It`s so ridiculous! It`s so bad that ultimately you find that yhou have become a bhoot and you are telling everbody that, `Your vibartions are bad,` because your vibrations are bad. Your attention is bad. Putting your attention to nonsensical things, makes your vibrations absolutely disappear. So with discretion you must have common sense, practical sense. I`ve seen people suddenly talking to anybody about Sahaja Yoga. No, that`s not practical.

Sahaja Yoga is a precious diamond. You can not give it to every person. I`ve seen people at the airport raising the Kundalini of everyone. No! It`s not meant. They have to come to Sahaja Yoga. They have to ask for it. They have to beg for it. Then only they can get their realization. We don`t want quantity, we want quality of the Sahaja Yogis, and the quality of the seekers. But when we start thinking of gettring a majority for a vote for Shri Mataji, I have to say, I am not standing for any election. Whether you elect me or not, I am elected. You don`t have to do that. I don`t need many people for that and when yhou fail in discretion you find some problems develop.
Now, it is for you to find out what indiscret things you have done. Where have you gone wrong? In which way have you done a mistake? It is for you to find out. Then, rectify it. Otherwise in Sahaja Yoga, there should be no problems, there should be no ordeals, there should be all joy and joy and joy. But the discretion should be to find out what are your weaknesses. Where have you done wrong? What`s gone wrong? Where? In what part? And how you have failed? Sometimes people think, ` Oh, we did a lot at that time, now we can`t do it.` Then you have failed. Like I heard that people are saying, `Now e have come here, so we`ll not go to Guru Puja.` Is wrong. It`s very wrong. You have to come to Guru Puja.` No question. Guru Puja is the one puja you cannot miss. Even if you miss Sahasrara, is all right, but Guru Puja is very important, at any cost you have to come for Guru Puja, which is Andorra, that`s not Himalayas.
Now, the Sahaja Yoga is so comfortable that we want that there should be no change of flights. Directly we sit on a Hamsa and we reach Andorra  place. You will. You will see that. But if you develop a habit of thinking, `Oh, it would be difficult,` then it will be. But as, `Mother has said it, it is going to be the easiest, everything is going to work out.` Once you think like that it will work out. Everything will work out. But first there should be pure desire to do it. Whenever such ideas come into your head, again, use your discretion. `We go to Guru Puja for our own help.` Every Guru Puja, if you remember, you have come up very much higher. Every Guru Puja has helped you. Of course, you say that Maharashtra tour is very good. I agree, it is. Maharastra tour helps you a lot. But that`s for thirty days, so intensive. Guru Puja is only one day. How many pujas do you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine. Sometimes even ten. That`s why, naturally, it has to be much more effective. But Guru Puja, itself, is extremely effective.

Indians have been asking me, `Mother once, at leastg ones more, give us the Guru Puja.` We`ll give anything to have a Guru Puja. Please come. This time, they wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine, you could not have attended Guru Puja in India. But Andorra, I have a special purpose. I have a special purpose. So please understand, I am not a purposeless personality, Gradually learn how I fulfill the purpose - yours, mine, and that of Sahaja Yoga, together. How I work it out beautifully. You will understand. And I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful ways and methods of discretion by which you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing.

Now, for the treatment of Hamsa Chakra, which is more on the physical side, it`s outside, that`s why it has to be much more on the physical
side also. So as we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well, to put the Hamsa Chakra all right. Also for Hamsa Chakra, is important not to kiss people. I think kissing must be given up, because in kissing you do allow the germs of another person. In Sahaja Yoga it`s all right. But once I say that, that doesn`t mean that you all go crazy with the kissing. No, not proper. If in India you go and kiss somebody he`ll just be standing, he will not know what is happening.
The more you startr expressing your love by all these gestures the less it is inside. The more you give expression of, now for example, there`s a method of expressing, `thank you,` and you go on saying `thank yhou, thank you, thank you, thank you.` It`s just a lip-service . But many people in many countries don`t say thank you at all. They`re very grateful, inside. The gratefulness, inside, creates the depth that is necessary. So, to do it superfically, anything, to much, has to be avoided in your discretion. But avoiding extremes, avoiding too much outward expression, again can create another indiscretion. Like the English, they don`t speak. The just don`t speak. You travel with them every day for twent five miles, sitting together, they will not say who you are. They`ll know each and every think about you, but they`ll just keep quiet. They are not supposed to speak. It`s artificial.
So the second point we have to come to, we are not to be artificial. It`s all right if somebody feels like just, out of just spontaneity wants to love me and hug me. I don` mind. Because it`s not artificial, it just comes. Children are most sponteineous. They are not artificial. They`re not at all artificial. In the same way we have to be very natural about everything. It`s all right, while talking to each other if the men git the men a little bit it doesn`t matter. They are not insulted, it`s a love, expression of love, it`s all right. But it should be spontaneous, it should not be artificial. We should not take to artificiality in Sahaja Yoga, at all, by any chance. But wearing clothes is not artificiality. To be decent is not aritficiality. To be dignified is not artificiality. Artificiality is that what yhou don`t feel inside, is to say out. That is artificiality, and for a Sahaja Yogi, he feels he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness, he has that protocol, and he respects his body. Out of respect of the body he doesn`t want to do something that will insult his body. And that`s how if you understand how far to go and how far to stop.
Then there is another way of indiscretion in Sahaja Yoga which I have seen, is that people start using Me in many purposes like that. Like, supposing now somebody`s writing a poem, so he`ll come to me, he`ll say,`Please correct my poem.` I will correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems, then he`ll loose the capacity to produce poems. You should not use Me for your own purpose in that manner, but in any case you are using Me. But with the understanding that.`Mother is all the time with me, and is helping me.` There`s no need to come forward and jump on My time, and to take My time, and to bother Me, so that I should feel, `Oh God, when will I get rid of this?` Or others have a thing, `Mother, you must come to my house, you must take my child, you must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard.` So taking attention to what you call, `yours` is also indiscretion.
Instead of that, you put your attention to Me, instead of taking My attention to you. It`s a very delicate line, as if we are walking on a sword. It`s a very, very delicate line of discreteion, but once you know as a state within yourself, you are discret, you cannot be indiscreet even if you want to be. And that is what is the ascent part. So once you come out of this chakra and pass through your Agnya, you enter into Sahasrara, where you have to be discret. Whatever then comes our from there is blessed. Whatever expression comes out blessed. From the Sahasrara is all discret and beautiful.
Some people have a habit of dominating Me, also. Like, I`m talking, they`ll talk in between. If I`m saying something, they will come forward. Then I play tricks. I`m good at playing tricks, but I`m very discreet. So it`s all right. My discretion plays the tricks, because if I`m direct, you won`t like it. So better to be discret and play tricks. In everything that we do discretion expresses itself. And if you are a solid Sahaja Yogi ar a Sahaja Yogini, your discretion is efficent, and everybody sees it and know it, that it is there. So for all of you, it is important to develop your discretion today and to ask Me to reside in your Hamsa Chakra so that you are all the time stationed in the power of discretion. With discretion we have evolved to human state, and to go further we have to develop our innate discretion, which I think is the essence of all the religion, of all the adventures we have had, of all the lives which we have known. Is the discretion around which everything moves.

May God bless you all.
