1987-10-26 Interview, Italy DP-RAW

Interviewer: In this dangerous period how can you say that is the blossom time because there is no peace in the world. You said that is the blossom time.

Shri Mataji: Blossom time, yes, blossom time because human beings have evolved to a point where they have to become the fruit.

Interviewer: This is fruit is becoming is realizing...

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s it - Enlightenment

Interviewer: How does it start sahaja yoga? How did you discover that you have the power of awaking the Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: I had this from my childhood. But I developed a method by which I could give a mass realization. In 1970 I started.

Interviewer: What does he think your husband about going always around the world, teaching sahaja yoga?

Shri Mataji: He travels much more than me, he has always travelled much more than me even before I started my work. So now he understands that one has to do the important work.

Interviewer: So, your husband is following sahaja yoga?

Shri Mataji: Of course, not only, he is supporting me in everywhere.

Interviewer: How can you manage then your private life with the Sahaja yoga

Shri Mataji: It’s the best because you become so dynamic, and you understand each other much better.

Interviewer: The image that you have of the guru, is the guru is always praying in savior, why that you are always joyful and happy.

Shri Mataji: If there is a real guru, he should be a happy person. Because he is joy.

Interviewer: How to become a witness? You said before in a press conference that, with press people - they have to be witness.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, you become the witness as soon as you become the spirit. Because spirit is the witness. It is not attached to anything.

Interviewer: How we can differentiate to be witness and to be an interpreter?

Shri Mataji: The difference is like this. Supposing you are standing in the water, and you are afraid of the waves you see, because you are standing in the water. For supposing you are in a boat, then you are not afraid.

Interviewer: You told me before that it might handle that I can discover if someone telling me the truth or its not the truth. Is this one possible? Is it always true reality or not? Which might handle, can I discover which is the right?

Shri Mataji: Of course, now you can. Because you are feeling the energy which is an all-pervading energy of truth and joy, and you can feel it. As soon as you put to somebody, you will know what is catching. Supposing this is catching, that means a person feeling guilty. This is catching, that means he must have been to some wrong guru or someone like that. Only the decoding I do for you.

Interviewer: But if this is the truth, and teaching that Shri Mataji is giving us, it is the revolutionary teaching, so how She is going to do it? How She is going to expand the sahaja yoga?

Shri Mataji: Through your media. Why media is given to you by God for this work only. At the time of Christ there was no media. So, when he died then people built-up churches and all which is of no use. Should be done when the person is alive.

Shri Mataji: Alright?

Yogini: She is happy.

Shri Mataji: She’s got to the right point.

Yogini: Ok,

Shri Mataji: Let’s see.
