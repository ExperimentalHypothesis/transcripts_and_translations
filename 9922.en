It is that you apply a mixture of turmeric and oil and all that to the body to the boy first and then is applied to the girl.

They feel better on the body and on the face, they feel soothed down. Its a kind of a jubilant thing, now they are in for marriage, now painted for marriage you can say. They are not supposed to talk to anyone They have to keep to themselves and to be very very quietly settled down. This function has to be done. For the girls who are to be married, will you please get up and come round here. The girls who are to be married, all the girls Now, this thing is a turmeric, another thing mixed together. And this may spoil your sarees a little bit, so Bring one towl and were very simple clothes, you see, you may just wear a saree and a blouse, you may not have the inner clothes. You can just come down there, and someone will apply this to you, or you can sit there at one side Then you have to go for a bath, to arrange for the bath now Where are you? Just come this side Now You first go from here so we will have to apply this to the boys first. Now those boys who are going to get married, should come forward.

With great courage. Now all your clothes are going to be spoilt and bring a towl, and wrap it and sit down with a towl so best thing would be that you change your dresses and bring a towel Go go go all of you, just bring a nice big towl, so that you cover yourself. All these clothes have to be taken, I am sorry, you have to be in your birthday suits. This has a very secret thing you see If the boy is suffering from any disease or anything you can see on the skin of the boy So this system also helps a person to find out, if there is such a problem that exists. There is quite a lot of things in it, and apart from that if he has any skin troubles, because it is an auspicious day, if some ordinary skin trouble then also application of this soothes his skin so it has a double purpose, but if he has some bad skin trouble I mean something comes from a very dirty disease or something that shows on the skin, so the people know about it. Of course these boys are healthy, but I am saying in general. And the boys who are not getting married should go move backwards, otherwise they will also be. Everybody must know that there clothes are going to be a little bit spoilt so be careful. No no no you are not alright, you don't have a big thing some big sheet or something? Go wrap yourself completely with a sheet and come back.

All this is going to be spoilt. Put a nice sheet around, tell them to put a big nice sheet around So now when the disturbed people have gone, we can talk to something else ..James is it alright for you? Its alright for me, yes.
