1990-10-20 EP before Diwali Puja Venice Italy

Shri Mataji: See the self-confidence you see that I am a realized soul so what? :)
[unclear due to sitar instrument in-between Mother's speech]
Then we say yoga as 'jog' that is When yoga becomes "jog" it is touchy...[unclear 05:28 ]the attention becomes the spirit.

Sahaja yogi (Artist ): And this was on the 30th of September I have a concert ...It was the morning concert after the concert I changed and I was staying in Zukh Which is very close to Kha (a place ) So I was staying in Zukh with some friends ...[39:25 unclear] when I played last, Rajesh was going back to Bombay and next to him was sitting a lady and Rajesh started talking to this lady, and this lady said Where are you coming from? So Rajesh said there is puja and Shri Mataji was there and We have puja that weekend and Nishant khan played at ...And this lady was a friend of mine She was sitting next to Rajesh. So she was very surprised So she said oh I wish I had known about him I would have come and this friend I was again staying [unclear 40:22 /with these friends ]So after my concert I changed into Jeans and the T-Shirt you know ...Then I went out left and walking and looking into the old[unclear] city ...And we were walking and I was trying to find an [unclear] I was trying to find the restroom and I got a restaurant ................[unclear41:00 ] too many Americans , Japanese, and foreigners ...
Shri Mataji: Zoom Lenses ...
Sahaja Yogi: So I was looking about 45 minutes [unclear ] and then suddenly I turned about and there was a big photograph Shri Mataji smiling ...and this poster was [unclear 41:48 ] ...
Then my friend said that this photograph was so beautiful. It almost said that you have found a good place So I went inside [unclear 42:10 ]...
Shri Mataji: This is all about Sahaja ...
Artist: It is your blessings with me. Wherever I go, in any path ...I feel so happy ...(in Hindi)
Shri Mataji: This is the "Ruhani" power which likes you ...It is flowing on you ...You don't know your photo has come and that contains full light ...You are sitting in front of me and playing and all there is light ...I will show you ...Nobody will believe ...there is all light ...

Artist: Everything is opened (chakras and all)
Shri Mataji: Hussain Khan sahib ...was the first time sitting in front of me ...little hesitating too ...After that second time when I went to Pune, they said (Papaji) they are playing very very well...Then I said he is the same person ....(Hussain Sahib)...then he went to ask [unclear 43:40 ] he came running to touch the feet...And said Mother how did you recognized us ...then I said I recognized you ...Now his name is very famous. His name is also famous ...Yours is famous no doubt but his name is also famous ...

Artist: You give "AShirwad" or blessings ...I was telling the same thing that Whatever love they have given, also by your grace whatever I have got (affection)I am coming here and playing for you I feel like I don't get this type of mood anywhere... I don't get this type of people, I don't get the people who listen so affectionately ....Where I will get the people who listen to me so lovingly /affectionately...

Shri Mataji: This is an accord ...
Artist: Now see, that the "jog" is also very serious Raga...In Hindustan we play "Jog ", and there are many good listeners in Hindustan but this kind of "gana bajana " (playing ) is very difficult... very difficult ...It is never seen anywhere ...Now it's all your blessings ...
I was very afraid tomorrow as Shri (name of the artist) didn't come I thought because [unclear44:57 ] ...I want to read this ...because the raga is such that ... "Jog"...

Shri Mataji: The song "jog" is there from years ... in our country.
But jog and yoga (yog ) ...You have done the yoga now "jog" will happen ...
Artist: (elaborates about Sahaj yogi and its pronunciation in his raga )
Shri Mataji: Sahaj yog is correct...
"Saha" means with you ..."Ja" means "who has taken the birth"...Yoga means reunion...Reunion with the divine is your right ...This is the meaning ...
Artist : (elaborating the "jog" raga )
Shri Mataji: All the beauty has come up
Artist: "Tum jano "
Now a lot of things came in "JAno" also ...
Shri Mataji: "Knowing everything "
Artist: By giving the love you told everything ...
Shri Mataji: Wah!
Artist : "tum ko tadap dekhan ko "...Now many things comeup with this "Dekhan" word ...
It is not only looking for someone ...But it is also to wait for somebody ...
It is looking from eyes as well as waiting also ...
" Tumko tadap sehen " means "inko tadap " Now I will not use "inka" word because it is about you. (then there is again one line and he elaborates like this:) By recognising they are happy and have faith that you are there (omnipresent ) ...
Shri Mataji: I have understood them...You have become a poet now ...
Artist: Not a poet ...
Shri Mataji: Bhai Sahib is charted Accountant and he is a poet...Now tell that one who is a charted accountant who doesn't know the "Rasa"...(Shri Mataji says about baba Mama also in between which is not clear)...It is so well ...
Artist: I wanted that on this occasion of Diwali, I should offer you something ...Because to make this "Khayal"(thinking ) is a very difficult task ...
Shri Mataji: No the way you have written [unclear 48:35 ] You will be surprised that the word "mahi "...Portuguese also use the word "mahi" for mother ...And in Bulgaria also the word "mahi" is used for mother. And in Maharashtra also ...Although the word mahi you have spoken is " avadhi " word. (in Hindi)

The Mahi word he has used is for mother and in many countries, it is called Mahi ...The Portuguese call it "Mahi".

Artist: If you have some special wish then please tell.
Shri Mataji: Play anything ...You are playing very well...
Namdevas poetry as you know is "Jogwa mahi aicha"
NAmdeva uses to say that We will ask "Jogwa" from Mother.
The same thing you told us...Namdeva used to say this ...That I will leave everything and will say to mother that please give me "jog"
And this is the "Jog".
This is a very beautiful Raga ...
very Beautiful ...
Artist: All the evening I thought that whether should I play this or not
Shri Mataji: No, No, Jogwa is a beautiful song everybody loves. The thing is, we never heard this type of Song ...(Mother praising the artist )
Shri Mataji: We enjoyed a lot ...Today is the finest (performance) Isn't it?
[Concert ]
Shri Mataji: See After the "joga"...After the reunion Now what the prise of God ...
I know the song of this raga ...is like this [unclear58:22 ] Oh god give me the most auspicious day that is then he praises god that you are the one that looks after the whole world Who [unclear] and in the description of God is absolutely [unclear 58:44 /after this]. This is the description of God after meeting alright!
Artist: (showing appreciation )
Shri Mataji: Now see the description of this.[unclear59:03]
[concert]
Also,[1:07:07 unclear]the feeling ...Every feeling of mirth is established ...It was put us into mirth ...The feeling of mirth ...that mirth is expressing[unclear1:07:16]
the quick movement just from the "tar" means the top scale ...top to the [unclear 1:07:25 ]...
Actually one thing that before enlightenment is the blindness it has is no connection but this is the thing that you are connected then you start felling the beauty that there has been a kind of a mirth...mirth I should say ...The heart starts jumping in a very mirthful mood[unclear 1:08:09] and you can't express it ...Like Kabira has said that "Jab mast huey phir kya boley "
when I am born to an absolute complete [unclear] of resolution into the joy than what should I talk about ...There is no word[unclear1:08:36] And that's how the situation is -When you just enjoy! in thoughtless awareness ...And this is What it is.
Real bhakti ...is that you are in thoughtless awareness... in your present ...very close to spirituality ...
And this is what this time ...to wake up ..the thoughtless awareness within you ...In Indian Music, you shouldn't think too much ...If you think then you are lost ...The words also are not so clear cut You have to just allow your heart to flow with it just allow you to work out...& know that you are realised souls ...and that you are describing the beauty of God ...And how we are describing ...It's an abstract...It is "nirakara" ...It's not in words [unclear]. So in abstraction, you are describing ...flows like waves that are [unclear] in your heart and then it touch your brain and go back to it.[unclear1:09:57]Thats why they enjoy it so much ...Now the artist tries to make an audience but the accord is only when you are connected with the same ocean of love ...then in the ocean of love the wave starts moving and they reach the shores and again this play goes on ...and[unclear 1:10:34]when you are not bound by anything but ...[unclear 1:10:49 ]
Absolute ...Extreme joy ...Can you see the rakhi to this Sitar...
Sitar is the sister ...We believe here the rakhi too much ...In the Sahaja yoga, We believe in Rakhi ...the festival of brother and sister...Even the sitar, is a sister Its respectful ...
[concert ]
[unclear1:25:40 ]
You must have seen it in raga but it was across...Cross style ...
[unclear1:56:52 ]
Today we saw, What a mastery I saw him half an hour he was fast ...So now I think we all Sahaja Yogis should bestow upon him the title of the star meaning the master at this young age. You are a star ...the sunshine ...
Sahaja yogis: Wah!
Shri Mataji: You are a star! Now you have become a star ...Automatically ...You are ...in Sahaj ...
Artist: This is all your blessings...
Shri Mataji: No, No Today you were like master ...I was looking from half an hour everybody is surprised ...
Artist: Your blessing! Can I play for 5 minutes?

Shri Mataji: yes yes (again mother appreciates )...Can you see that ...What a voice ...of course tabla is there but the rhythm with the right hand ...He kept the same rhythm ...the rhythmic movement ...1:59:34So beautiful and at this young age this gentleman has become now a master ...I think he is the youngest ...He is the youngest I have known so far ...
