Nabhi Chakra Date 15th March 1984 : Place Delhi : Public Program Type : Speech Language Hindi

Our greetings to all the true seekers of God! Today, you have heard two types of songs. In the first song, a devotee calls out to God in separation. This is called inferior devotion, and when one finds God, as Kabir did, it is called superior devotion. Both are forms of devotion. Krishna called it 'Ananya Bhakti' - where there is no one else, where the Supreme God is present directly in front of oneself, at that time, what our devotion looks like to us, they called it superior devotion - Ananya Bhakti. However, when we remember God, when we recall them, then it becomes a habit for us. When a person becomes habituated to this thing, it takes a long time for them to break free from that habit. They are not ready to believe that their practice is about to end. And for this reason, devotees also did not recognize perspectives, saints, and ascetics. You know, throughout history, saints have always had to endure so many troubles. It's not that everyone troubled them, but those who did were not stopped or taught that these are saints, these are ascetics. Now in our society, especially in cities, there are people with various beliefs. Some have faith in God in such a way that, like going to a temple and offering prayers, they believe that's enough. Some say, "No, one should practice devotion to God (vaguely) and sing their auspicious songs. They should always worship them, so they are always remembered." Some people say that God and such are all false notions, it's a hoax, and there is no such thing as the name of God. The right to think in all ways has been given to humans by God; this gift of thinking is given by God to humans who are independent, who can think whatever they want. But we should think in all three situations till today, whether whatever we did, whether we believed in God, worshipped them, or gave lectures on them, or read books about them; whatever effort we made, or we did not believe in them, we said whether they exist or not, we (Unclear) and said let's see where God is. In all these situations, we should think about what is good for us, what we gained; what new nature has come within us, because of which whatever we did is all right. Our forefathers also did the same, and their forefathers also did the same, and for thousands of years, this same thing has been going on.

In Sahaja Yoga, we focus on the two nadis, Ida and Pingala. Even in this, the Ida nadi is conducive to devotion; people become absorbed in devotion on the Ida nadi; they overflow with emotions and, being absorbed in God, sing their praises.

In our Maharashtra, which I believe is a very large region in Hindustan, because here traditional people are religious, and the revered deity here is Krishna Vithala, people go singing every month with a cymbal in their hands, "Vithala, Vithala, Vithala," with tobacco in their mouths. Now, tobacco is against Krishna, it's totally against Him. Because in the Vishuddhi Chakra resides Lord Krishna, and they are calling out Vithal Vithal, taking the name of Lord Krishna, and yet they keep the contradiction within their mouths. Such people, many people I have seen, come to me and say, "Mother, we have been worshipping Vithal all our lives. Every time we go there on foot, and every month we make efforts." Many educated people also do such deeds - "But we haven't found God." There was a Muslim gentleman who was very earnestly seeking the Divine. In the end, he became Hindu. His argument was that by being a Muslim, one doesn't attain God, so let's become Hindu and find Him, so he became Hindu, and being Hindu, he continued chanting "Vithal Vithal" in the same manner. So he said, "First, I used to pray, and my knees would ache, then I would perform the pilgrimage, and my shoulders would ache, and amidst all this, I realized that I haven't found God." Those who stand before Vithal are not near God, and those who go there are also not near God." We are constantly either reciting a continuous scripture or remembering God. In this way, we keep remembering God in our consciousness. From this, one thing is certain: God resides in our consciousness. Namdev has said that if a boy is flying a kite and the kite is going up into the sky, and all the children are playing with him. He is also talking and joking, and even while doing so, his mind is fixated on the same sky where his kite is, towards it. In this way, for a realized person, his entire consciousness is directed towards that. But a person who is not realized, if he has not yet attained self-realization, then it is appropriate for him to remember God. But if despite doing all this, God is remembered and still not found - as you said, these disturbed people are searching, and if they don't find God - then necessarily the person may say, "Yes, there is no such thing as the name of God." But because we haven't experienced it, we haven't realized it, therefore completely denying that thing, in my opinion, is unscientific. It's a kind of escapism to say it doesn't exist without knowing it, without realizing it. Whether you accept it or not, God exists. I told you, who creates these flowers? Who turns these flowers into fruits? Who creates us like our parents? Who operates our hearts within us? There are many behaviors within us that even medical science cannot fully explain,   how they occur. That's why humans delve into devotion and remember God. When we come to the Pingala Nadi, there, humans thought that since God has created this creation, we should know about the five elements, the panchmahabhutas, present in this creation. We should understand their dominance. So they started rituals like yajnas, composed Vedas, etc. But it's also written at the very beginning of the Vedas that if one doesn't attain knowledge from the Vedas, if it does not impart realization doesn't, and then the entire Vedas are useless. This is a great glory of India, a very grand glory. No matter how great a scholar, a pundit, or a Veda Vyasa may be people don't bow down before them. But if someone is a saint, a faqir, even if they carry a begging bowl, and they are recognized as a saint, then people bow down before them, whether they are kings or whatever they may be. This is a great glory of our country. You won't find this anywhere else. This happens only in this country because this country has its own special virtue. Here, there have been great virtuous souls, saints, and sages. The biggest question that has arisen from our external-focused perspective is how to turn everyone's vision inward. And foremost, people should know that all this knowledge is stored only in this country, this great country. Now, whatever I'm telling you, consider it in the same way as when a scientist is presented with a hypothesis. If you look at it from that perspective, you'll understand that what I'm saying should be observed and understood first. Then, after experiencing it, you should examine whether it is true or not; whether there is God or not. But first, you have to make the assumption. You have to assume that there are such things. You should listen to it. If you're stuck on that point, you can't move forward. First, you need to embrace it, try to understand what I'm saying. I had briefly explained to you about these three nadis. Today, I want to tell you about different chakras. There are seven main chakras within you. It's not that there are only seven chakras; seven are considered the primary ones. This knowledge is the essence of our country's heritage. You won't find this in books; it was discovered by various sages and ascetics, and there are some books on it too. However, they are quite advanced, and secondly, they are also not readily available. These seven chakras are intricately woven within us, much like steps built for our ascension. Since the time we were carbon, gradually, as we began to rise, with each ascension achieved, like a milestone... It's said that first came carbon, the initial manifestation within us; that is the first chakra, known as the 'Muladhara Chakra'. There are many misconceptions about this chakra as well. When it comes to Kundalini, just observing it starts to evoke words. I have also read books where after reading, one would say, "There's no need to go near Kundalini." Someone wrote that when their Kundalini awakened, lightning started flashing inside them. Someone else wrote that sores appeared on them. Someone said they started jumping like frogs. Not just in Hindi, but also in English, such books have been published extensively. In actuality Kundalini is your mother. She is the mother of every individual. She is your personal mother. And this mother gives you your second birth. This mother, this special goddess mother, will she give you any trouble? Try to understand. When you were born, did your mother give you trouble, or did she bear all the pains herself? Then, this mother, this special goddess mother, will she trouble you? Or will she bother you? One should also use wisdom. Those who speak such things either are not capable of handling Kundalini at all. They may not be religious, they may be irreligious. Their character may not be good; they may be making money, cheating people. There could be all sorts of flaws in them. They may not have any knowledge about it. It's possible that someone might have tried some occult practices on them and caused them harm. Anything is possible. But thousands of people have experienced Kundalini awakening through Sahaja Yoga, and we haven't seen people facing such problems or difficulties. Kundalini itself has intelligence. Complete intelligence is within Kundalini. And just like there's a tape recorder, similarly, your entire history is written within these three-and-a-half coils. Since you were carbon, your entire history until now. It knows what mistakes you've made, what wrong paths you've taken, what misbehave you've had with yourself, with others, what actions you've done that can be obstacles in the path of God. She knows everything. She has a complete account of it. But she's your mother. A mother doesn't think about how guilty her son is. She thinks about how to give her son whatever wealth she has. How to protect him. A mother doesn't think about it - imagine if someone's child is drowning, the mother doesn't think about what wrongs the child has committed to her, how much trouble he caused. She thinks, "Whatever happens, let this child be saved." Right now, the focus is on saving this child. Similarly, this mother thinks about how to save you in any way possible. But for this mother, what is found in your childhood is a place of unawareness, which we call innocence, it is located at the Muladhara Chakra. This Kundalini, which is above, and the chakra below. Kundalini itself is seated in Muladhara. 'Muladhara,' which is called 'the foundation of the root.' If the root is Kundalini, then its foundation means its home, your home, which is your triangular bone, and below it is the Ganesh element that resides within you.  These days, being cunning, showing cleverness, behaving rudely, or, shall we say, constantly embarrassing oneself with one's character has become a kind of big trait. People think they have achieved a lot in this. Deceiving with one's integrity, always attaching some title or the other to oneself, our big concern is how to do what in what way. This chakra within us is very important. However, in this country, this chakra is very strong because, no matter what, people here know the meaning of integrity. People do wrong things, but they know it's wrong. In these foreign lands, I have seen that they do wrong deeds, speak such strange things that it's hard to understand if they are human or animals, and they think they have made a big gains, they have achieved complete freedom. They have gained so much by doing such dirty deeds. Sri Ganesha, especially the way he is made, his form is such that he has the head of an elephant. The reason is that an elephant is an animal, and animals never gather ego. That's why there is no sense of ego within it; it remains forever innocent. And Ganesha Ji is forever innocent. But within him, there are weapons, and the special arrangements he has, all those arrangements control the human's pelvic plexus. But they are so powerful that if you attempt to harm Kundalini in any way, or the man who is irreligious, who lacks character, tries to awaken Kundalini, they become so angry; Ganesh sits at the lowest level, but along with that, the Ida Nadi is awakened above it. When their anger rises on this Ida Nadi, blisters can occur in the person's body from here to here. Such a person can suffer in the heat, he can be in pain. This element of Ganesh, as delightful as it is, is equally provocative. It is extremely angry. In this Bharatvarsha, you know the eight Ashta Vinayakas of Ganesh, they are awakened, and they have emerged from the elements of the earth... (Unclear) But what is this awakened element? Do we know what this awakened element is? Is there any truth that there is a place for such an awakened element? Such a place exists. Because the earth element itself is directly awakened. Now you will be surprised, I went to a small village, named ‘Musalwari,’ there people told me that this is an awakened place, and no walls could be built there. Who said, "This place belongs to the Mother, leave it." When we went there and saw from within, waves of consciousness were coming, cool and soothing; it's perceptible (unclear), but only a Fauquier or some saint or a yogi can explain this. One who hasn't experienced it cannot say what is true and what is false. Whether it is true or false. For this, you need a high level of awareness, what we call collective consciousness, you have to be awakened in it. Again I would say you have to be awakened. Even until you attain it, until the recognition of it doesn't come within you, until you don't have the 'knowledge' of it, there will always be a difference between you and those who are realized. The specialty of this chakra is that when the Kundalini awakens - it's good if you sit with your hands open towards me. Work can be done even during speech, you are sitting with your hands in this way towards me, and then these five fingers of yours, the ends, are in these way seven chakras on the left side and seven chakras on the right side. Now, these seven chakras that are in our left and right, as I explained, merge with each other, and the Sushumna Nadi lies between them. Now, when you sit with your hands towards me, slowly, gradually, the consciousness begins to flow from it. When the consciousness starts flowing, it goes and informs Lord Ganesha that now an authorized person is standing in front. This authority is not obtained from schools, colleges, or from anyone through reading; this authority belongs only to the enlightened person. When such a person who is knowledgeable, you extend your hands in this way before them, then Lord Ganesha first receives and extends the invitation to the Kundalini, requesting to ascend. This work cannot be done without Lord Ganesha. Now, if someone were to say to a doctor that Lord Ganesha looks after your prostate gland, takes care of it, and nurtures it, they would say, "What are you talking about, Mother? What does Lord Ganesha have to do with medical science?" Medical science is up there. But if Lord Ganesha is sitting at its root, then for a moment, one should ask with their intellect, "If this can somehow solve our questions, then why not understand what Lord Ganesha is and how important it is for him to be awakened within us?" There was a gentleman who came to us and started saying, "Mother, I have a problem with my prostate, the doctors say I need surgery." He was a great Sahaja Yogi, another devotee of Lord Ganesha. I said, "You are a devotee of Ganesha, if Lord Ganesha is displeased with you, I don't understand." He started saying, "I am such a devotee of Lord Ganesha." I said, "Alright. So, Bhai! Eat these chickpeas. Why what’s the hitch?" I said, "Why this nervousness?"

They started saying, "Today is Sankashti, I observe fast on Sankashti." I said, "Today our offering is chickpeas, so have chickpeas." So they started looking around. I said, "Today our offering is chickpeas, so have chickpeas." So they started looking around. I said, "That's the reason. On the day of Lord Ganesha's birth, you are observing a fast? Who told you that on the day of birth, you should fast?" Now, see how many faults are there in religion; many people say, "We are very religious, we are so religious, mother," and yet they face difficulties. Now, look a little carefully, when Lord Rama is born, then we will fast. When Lord Krishna is born, then we will fast. And on Narak Chaturdashi, the day when the gates of hell open, people will sit and have a feast in the morning. All opposite things. Absolutely opposite. I don't know who taught this. On the day your son is born, what fasting will you observe? Look, on the day Dattatreya was born, there is fasting. See, on the day someone is born, they fast. What's the need to fast on that day? I don't understand. I said, why do you fast on such a big Ganesh? When did he say to fast? You have to do, what you have to do. If you want to fast, do it; otherwise, it's not necessary. Secondly, I don't understand fasting in the name of God. In this country, we make so many mistakes, and completely out of ignorance, as someone said. Due to issues like women's conduct, Brahmin conduct, so many faults have come into our religion. The situation is the same for Muslims, the same for Christians, the same for Sikhs. Everyone has the same issue that we don't understand what to do at what time. Now I told them to eat. You won't believe it, I said, "Stop your nonsense now." From today, you promise that on the day of Sankashti, you will make and eat modak, because they are His likes. So when they make and eat modak, they said, "Mother, I promise you that I will eat modak." You will be surprised to know that their prostate problem disappeared. They reached Pune and sent a letter saying, "Mother, my prostate is gone - its problem is gone." In the same way, in religion, we commit numerous mistakes. And that's why when we say, "We have embraced religion," we do what we do, Mother! Why then it happens this way?" Now, see how many faults are there in religion. As people say, when Kundalini awakening happens, there is intense heat, and it's like that. It's all false. Absolutely false. There is nothing like that. Do not believe it at all. These people, who are just trying to make money, scare you into believing that they are very influential people. And this leads you astray, and you start wondering, "Bhai, our Kundalini awakening happened, but our condition worsened. We ended up in the asylum." It's bound to happen. Because instead of Kundalini awakening, there is over activity in your Central sympathetic nervous system, which can make you go lunatic. Now, I told you about Lord Ganesha, then there is the Swadhisthana chakra, which I have already told you about. Above that chakra is the second chakra, which is called the Nabhi chakra. Because from this chakra, the Swadhisthana chakra emerges outward, like a lotus, and revolves around all sides— the space that is created in the middle, which is called the 'Bhavasagar', the space of your abdomen, which is called Viscera, it provides power to all the senses, organs, and everything within it. I've already told you that problems in this chakra can lead to diseases like diabetes. But today, I will tell you about its root element, which is the Nabhi chakra. The Nabhi chakra is the chakra of Vishnu, the chakra of Narayana. Now, someone might say, "Mother, you're only talking about Hinduism." But many other people, many others, are also excluded from this. Even Jesus Christ also said that those who are not against me should be with me. Christian people will not find out who else is there. They have said that there is no one except Jesus. Islam has made it that there is no one except Mohammad. In this way, they have separated everyone meticulously, like a man hanging somewhere. Everyone is interconnected. Only we are calling them by their names. Look around this chakra and you'll see that this part of the abdomen contains the elements of ten gurus. From the beginning, from 'Adi Nath' to various other gurus like Socrates, Lao-Tse, they all come within this. Moses हैं, Abraham Moses, Abraham, King Janak in his country, Nanak, Mohammad Sahab, Zoroaster (Zarathustra), and finally, the recent one, Shri Sainath 'Shirdi'. These are the ten main incarnations of these. There have been many gurus in the world, but these are the ten main ones. Now, the people who consider and accept any guru are under a big misconception. A guru is the one who connects you with the Master. The one who connects you with the Supreme Being, that is the guru. But here, we have all kinds of gurus emerging. And you know, we have become so distracted, so deluded, that any person who is released from jail and sits down wearing saffron robes; people start touching his feet. Firstly, what is our relationship with saffron robes? We are householders. Household members should have no connection with saffron robes. You know, if you have read Valmiki's Ramayana, Sita Ji has spoken extensively about these ascetics in a whole chapter, saying that ascetics should not even come to the city. They should not come to any village; many guidelines were given for them. It was said that they should stay outside the village in huts and should not accept any hospitality from householders. Yes, however, those who have taken renunciation are forbidden to do all this. But here, see that we householders are engaged in performing sacrifices, taking care of our children. We live by rules, and it is our responsibility to support those ascetics; they are dependent on householders. But, our children don't grow, and on top of that, these ascetics in their saffron robes sit adorned from morning till evening. It's a simple fact that no one can reach the Supreme Being by taking renunciation. That's an external thing. 'Renunciation' is an inner feeling. It's not external. You know that King Janaka was called Videha and his daughter was called Vaidehi because she was born from Videha. He was himself a king. He lived like a king, adorned like a king, and in front of him were great sages, saints, seers, bowing their heads because that was his state, because he himself was the incarnation of Lord Dattatreya. They were incarnations of the original Guru. But nowadays, in our country, awareness of this is diminishing. People have become very confused, and superficially someone appears to be showing something from above. If a spectacle-maker arrives, people rush to his feet first. Some know how to do the spectacle, running after any spectacle is in our nature. If a spectacle-maker arrives, we run after him. Then, 'thousands of people will follow him,' people say, and then spread false rumors about him, that he cured this person, he got better, they found peace, such misconceptions. Many people say that they went to that guru, they found peace. I said, what kind of peace you found, maybe you found peace in the cremation ground. Now you can't even move, you must be in unrest. The unrest has become like a solid rock. Now you can't move, such arrangements have been made. Because the way these people work, the way they do this business, you know, we are quite old and we all knew about it. Now you are all from the younger generation, maybe you don't even know about witchcraft, astrology, necromancy. Occult knowledge is abundant in our country. At this time, I feel that the minds of the people in Delhi have distracted from tantric, otherwise, wherever you go, there was a tantric sitting in every alley. In your capital city. You have become deluded by these tantric and have gotten stuck in it. People who chase after such trivial things, how will they attain the Supreme Being? And if must you seek, then you should ask for something supreme. And in the Supreme, everything is found—because Lord Krishna said, "Yog Chem Vahamyamum” “I preserve what you have and carry what you lack." When there is yoga, then your well-being will be complete. Some people say, "Mother, improve my health." Many wrestlers come to me, saying, "Mother, we have no peace." Someone says, "Mother, I have no money." Another rich man comes and says, "There is no one in the world unhappy than me." This means that the whole world is unhappy. And if you think that someone else has something in this unhappy world, then they are happy, this is a misconception. Believe that the person you consider happy may actually be deeply unhappy. But you don't know. Therefore, whatever you are asking for will not bring you happiness. What you are asking for, ask for it, but it is more and beyond that. And that ultimate essence is within you. That which you need to attain. There is no need to go anywhere for it, no need to give anything to anyone. There is no vanity in it, it's a very simple and straightforward thing.

Just as you can sprout a seed if you put it in the womb of Mother Earth, similarly, this task can be accomplished. But even being straightforward and simple for a human becomes difficult. Because he doesn't know how to eat directly anymore. He ends up eating by twisting his hand. Doing any work straightforwardly is beyond his intellect; his intellect has become so complex. Over thinking has damaged his mind. Due to this guru, diseases like cancer occur. Bowing your head in front of the wrong guru. Therefore, someone has said, "Don't bow your head in front of everyone." Even when you go to temples, any person can put a mark on your forehead. Getting a ‘Tilak’ on your forehead from every person is a big flaw. Who has the right to touch your forehead? You know, you said that it takes 9-10 years to meet. I say that for thousands of years, the Divine has been creating you, and now you bow your head in front of anyone? Bending your head in front of anyone has always been discouraged. Only the realized person knows in whose presence one should bow their head. We say that there is no need for anyone to touch our feet. And it's better if they don't. Until you transcend, until consciousness comes into your hands, for you, we are just like others, just as when you go to temples, we sitting here, what's the benefit of you touching us? The benefit of coming to the feet can only be if that connection has started within you. If we are talking in front of a microphone and there is no connection, what's the use of talking? That's why going to anyone's feet or taking some one on yours, both should be considered a fault. People will now force a lot. If you tell someone not to touch your feet, they feel as if you've cursed them. I say, son, why are you touching? What have I given you? Why are you touching my feet? Until I have introduced you to self realization, why are you touching my feet? I could also be a fraud, I could also be wrong. What is the reason for you to touch my feet? Habit. And because of this habit, our eleven Rudras, which are positioned on the most important Chakra on our forehead, where Rudra sits. Rudra, as you know, is the force of destruction. If you consider someone else as a guru in this way, then your Rudra is caught on the right side. And as soon as it gets caught, cancer is the first disease that occurs. If a person is understood to be a politician in front of someone, it is understood that he bows a lot in front of someone. That could also happen. If a person is an economist or a businessman, and if he bows excessively in front of someone, more than necessary, for his business... If any person bows excessively in front of someone, more than necessary, then he may get cancer.

"It is completely forbidden for a human to bow down in front of everyone, as all the five, out of five Rudras of this side are affected. But to be arrogant is also a vice. Saying, 'I am the guru,' 'I am God,' 'I am everything,' 'I do everything,' who is there to tell me? There are also those who say, 'You are the guru, and you should search for it, don't let others search.' You are everything. This is also wrong."

"Because you are not an enlightened one. Until a lamp is lit, it cannot ignite itself; only a lit lamp can ignite it. But there is no give-and-take involved in that. There is no selfishness involved in it. There is no kind of favor involved. If your lamp is not lit and you touch a lit one, you get enlightened. There is no such thing where you can say completely that you are like this. I have seen many people like that. In Spain, there are 50,000 people who are so submissive to a guru that they have gone crazy. Once the Queen of Spain met me." She was saying, "You send such charlatans from your  country here, what should we do with them? It's incomprehensible. Fifty thousand young people here have gone completely crazy. They have sent all kinds of people out here. You haven't got anything else for export in this country; rather, they have sent these people out in droves, so much so that everyone has earned a bad name for us. And if you say anything about them, people say, 'Mother, you are very intolerant.' So should we honor such people with garlands? Should we place them on thrones? In ancient times, demons were killed. Their complete extermination was carried out after killing them." But at least now they can be called "demons and ogres." Why do you people get so troubled by it? Are you also in cahoots with them? Where is the righteousness in plundering, looting, extorting money from others, diverting them into other paths, especially as Indians, what right do they have? This is a strange kind of hidden aggression. And it is so pervasive that you will be surprised that a gentleman comes there, to London; and he says, "If you give me a Rolls Royce, I will come."  Now, all the boys ate only potatoes for a year, saved money; and they cannot even  lit a lamp. They gave him a Rolls Royce, and a Lama gentleman arrived there - when these people came and told me, I was greatly surprised. The Lama, who usually becomes a great ascetic monk, when he arrived there, he said, "We don't want anything except a marble floor." It's almost as if their personality has extinguished. And you just see that marble is very expensive there, in Sweden. So the poor people of Sweden, staying hungry, made a marble floor for them, and then they arrived there. And after they arrived, the thing is, whenever you go before them, you bow a thousand and one times before them. I'm telling you all these things because in every such situation, there are always some of you involved. Ten people came in the morning. Nine of them were in that situation. I asked them what they got, whether they went to get a diamond. Now, your mother is there, she has a heart trouble, you go to them and they say, "Mother, we don't understand, we didn't make a mistake." I said, "What did you go searching for, tell me." One who speaks of the Supreme and one who gives the Supreme, one should go to their feet and take refuge in them; everything else is useless, these things, when spoken are nothing but words and, can disturb a person's mind. You must have heard many people talk about the Vedas. Vedas,  Vedic scholar, this and that. There's a gentleman in Bombay, a much esteemed Vedic scholar. Despite his age being younger than ours, he's not older. But when he speaks, it feels like he's bewitched. The one, who keeps talking, they keep talking in such a way that no one wants to stand near him for five minutes. Now they don't understand why people run away from them? They are so arrogant and what to say to them, an ascetic, such a hot temperament individual, that whoever sits with them says, "Wow, a storm has come." And they get so angry that if someone doesn't understand them, they say, "You are so wicked, you are so bad," and they start hitting. Now tell me, despite being such Vedic scholars and having all these all of it has just remained on the surface. Nothing has gone into their hearts. Neither compassion, nor empathy, nor anything, they just keep rambling morning and evening. I have seen many like this in France. They just keep rambling while riding the bus. I asked what happened, and they started saying that these were revered Father. I said, "Wow brother, this is the condition of the Father." They were revered Father, so we didn't say anything to them, we just kept listening to their ramblings from morning till evening. There are many like this in France. In my opinion, it should be like this there. People have studied a lot. So there should be such gurus who only engage in discussions. They will tell you to recite fifty parayanas. Recite the Dattatreya parayana. Recite the guru parayana. After reciting fifty parayanas, what did you achieve? A gentleman came to us and started saying, "Mother, I have been practicing austerity for fourteen years." I said, "Okay, and?" "He just told me to recite parayanas and kept washing the Shivji temple." "And what happened next?" He said, "Kundalini awakening happened in a minute." So I said, "Bhai! One should think about this. If God is attained by reciting parayanas, then how many people in our country cannot even read? Does that mean they won't attain God? Will only educated people attain Him? What about the Vedic scholars? How many people can read the Vedas, how many know Sanskrit? I say, how many people read the Quran Sharif? Or the Bible? Does it mean those who don't read are useless? How can that be? The Supreme Creator, who loves everyone equally, will He ever do such a thing?" Therefore, beware of the defects in the guru principle and stay away from it. And this guru principle puts a limit, a kind of boundary within you in every way. "That we will show by doing this." God is not attained through all these things. Sahaja, simple. Sahaja meditation is required. Sahaja. It went simply. Anything that is not Sahaja, that is unnatural, cannot be of God. Think about it straightforwardly, what efforts did you make to become human? What did you do, that you stood up on your feet? What struggles did you endure, did you cut your tail? How did you become what you are? To become a human, you naturally become simple. Similarly, to reach a higher state, there should be a feeling of 'naturalness', and until that Sahaja feeling arises, whatever artificial things you do will harm you. There will be difficulties, entanglements, you will be troubled - whether they are physical, mental, or intellectual. But you will get stuck in trouble, so I already said, sit in a Sahaja state of mind and said, "Sing Kabir." Because Kabir sang in a natural state, he had already achieved union, so he sang in that union. Now, regarding your chakra, at one point, you accepted anyone as your guru, a mere pretender, or someone who says to accept anyone as a guru. You accepted the wrong person as your guru. You bowed your head to wrong things. Then there are others who don't accept anyone, they don't even accept God. "I am everyone's guru." The five Rudras on their left side grab them. These are the two types of people in nature. Now, those who don't accept anyone, who are heavily into Vedic studies, I have already described to you what kind of people they are. And they, who possess such abundance, are so richly arrogant, and that one might even think this person could have God, but no one believes it. Even God could pass by them, no one would believe it. The Supreme Being is an ocean of love, joy, abundance, and compassion, an ocean of forgiveness. A person who is so filled with anger, so filled with greed for everything, can never truly be a person of God. Now, I would definitely like to tell you about the essence of Vishnu, which is amidst this ocean of existence. Because wherever I go in my country, people say to me, "Mother, what will happen to our poverty?" As for those who might have alleviated some poverty, those who ask me what will happen to our poverty. The same thing happened. "Krishna said, 'Yog Kshem Vahamyaham,' meaning first attain yoga, then I will ensure your well-being." Wherever we went, those who attained yoga had all their problems solved. How? Firstly, all their bad habits disappeared; righteousness awakened. All the habits that had bound a person were simultaneously released. You know, during the tour, there were 200 people from abroad traveling with us. We didn't know how many of these people were taking drugs, how many were alcoholics, or what other habits they had. We did not heed anything. Who so ever came, let him first get realized; and after realization the righteousness prevailed. One gentleman, who used to drink a lot, became spiritually awakened after crossing the threshold. The day after experiencing spiritual awakening, his alcohol addiction disappeared. Once, when we went to Germany, he said, "Let's see what happens." He used to enjoy a particular brand of alcohol. After drinking it, he started vomiting uncontrollably, and there was such a foul smell emanating from it! So we asked, "Are they drinking molasses or Scotch? We can't even understand what they are drinking!" It was so much vomiting that it became disgusting. We didn't do anything; we were just sitting there in London. But after your Kundalini chakras awakened and you had your realization, after your own dirty habits vanished, your perspective started to shift towards where your Lakshmi element is. Like one gentleman — it might be a bit hard for you to believe, but let me tell you — someone we knew, he told us, "Ever since I started Sahaja Yoga, a big miracle happened." I said, "What was that? The soil here has become so good that a man came to me and said, 'Brother, a faqir came and told us that if you take a little soil from here and make bricks out of it, they will become as strong as stones.' So he came to us and took soil from here on weight basis." But first, there should be awakening, the awakening of the Lakshmi principle. Without the awakening of the Lakshmi principle, if you want Lakshmi to come within you, she won't. Money may come, but Lakshmi won't. And how is Lakshmi? She is the giver with one hand. Their refuge is in one hand, and in that hand are two beautiful lotus flowers, which are symbols of their love. And not only that, there is also a Bumble bee with so many thorns on it, but it shelters them all within itself. Such ‘Lakshmi Pati’ can be those who stand in such balance in resolution. They stand so simply, with so much dignity, on the lotus. Nowadays, I often see that those who have money have no dignity. It is not visible within them that they have any respect. They degrade themselves in such an undignified way that it is incomprehensible why they need to be so sycophantic when they have the grace of Lakshmi. But it's not the grace of Lakshmi, its just money. If you put a banknote on a donkey, will it become a Laxmi Pati? That's how those who have money are. They were the kind of wealthy people who didn't flaunt their wealth in front of anyone, whose life came in their 'pride'. Today, you cannot see them in abroad. Our father himself was like this. He had such a generous nature that he used to distribute things every Sunday morning. One day he would give blankets, another day something else. And his eyes always remained downcast, and he kept giving. He kept giving. And if you question him "What are you doing to that wealth and money?" And two or three blankets are being taken for one person, why are your eyes downcast?" He said, "Bhai, I am not giving, someone else is giving. That's why I feel ashamed. Everyone says you are giving." They were indeed very independent and brave, but they felt ashamed in this matter because people were telling them, "I feel great embarrassment when people say to me, 'You're giving.'” They started saying while giving, “The giver knows what to do, what's my role? I'm just standing in between." Such people were there before in this India, now I don't know, nothing seems visible anymore. For the wealthy, it has come to mean being very arrogant, very cruel, not caring about their parents, siblings, thinking they are everything. These are the signs of the wealthy. Not caring about anyone in the world. Now that the spirit of money has possessed us here, our societal structure will completely collapse because of this spirit. As for women, it has now become that money is more important than the husband, more important than the children. In every aspect where money becomes paramount and love becomes negligible, there the form of Lakshmi disappears. The embodiment of Lakshmi vanishes altogether, and in that place, life becomes completely dominated by money, which is evident today abroad. Even those who go from here to foreign lands, don't know what happens to them; breaking all traditions, they recklessly chase after money. I am astonished to see those people, who are from my country, behaving in such a manner. When we set ourselves on the wrong path like this, we face severe consequences. Those with such wealth often have to face very bad days. Their children, who turn out to be worthless, run amok here and there and engage in wrongdoing. There is no blessing for such wealthy individuals. Go and see, they don't sleep all night. They are troubled. So, obtain the money that is the form of Lakshmi, acquire that wealth which is the gift of Lakshmi. And therefore, the poverty of this country will be eliminated on the day when there is yoga here. It cannot happen before that; try if you can. I went. There, in Rahuri, I saw that many huts had been built, they said these huts were constructed. I said, "Alright." A city was built, I said, "What kind of city?" I don't know. As we were going from there, there was a road ahead, from that side people were coming after drinking alcohol and stumbling. One person fell in front of our car. And not just one, not just two, but quite a few people were coming out from there. I asked, "What kind of city is this? What is this?" They said, "Yes, this is a city of huts, only alcohol runs here." They said, "Yes, this is how it is." If you give a hut, they start selling alcohol in it, and if you give 100 rupees, they start consuming alcohol. This is not a sign of removing poverty. Poverty will not be eliminated this way. Alcohol has become so prevalent that 50 percent of the poor will die from it, so poverty will itself be eliminated. Treatment is happening in such a way that people are not even willing to live. They were falling so badly on the road, there was no strength in them, they became weak and feeble. How can you remove their poverty? Giving them money, result; they drank alcohol, engaged in illicit activities, and ruined themselves completely. Now, another question arises about removing poverty: when we practice such black magic and impure knowledge, Goddess Lakshmi leaves from the other door. In a household where black magic begins, Goddess Lakshmi leaves from the other door. Today, I am especially talking about religion because it is very important to know how many mistakes are there in our religion. People who celebrate Diwali in their homes, lighting lamps everywhere at night, because it's the darkest night. At that time, it should not happen that Goddess Lakshmi returns somewhere. They do not like darkness. And with as much impure knowledge, as much occultism, ghost knowledge, cemetery knowledge, and this evil circle of gurus, the false gurus who are running this circle, because of all these circles, this  country has become completely dark, it has become completely dark. And because of this black darkness, this country cannot rise. Until you don't drown these people in the ocean, until you don't remove them from your heart, and won't cleans your society of such things, your society's poverty won't go away because Goddess Lakshmi does not reside in such places. The third reason why Lakshmi is not in our country is because "where women are revered, there the gods dwell," which means that where a person worships and respects women, there the presence of the gods is felt. But women should also be respectable; there should be such women who are worthy of worship, who are pure, who come into the world with noble thoughts. Who lovingly take care of their home, relatives, and everyone with affection. Such a woman, who is revered, her husband should respect her, her family should respect her. The respect of women, of children, of daughters, of mothers, where there is respect, there the gods dwell. Otherwise, the dance of ghosts begins. Now you are hearing about the situation of women in our country, I would still say that the Indian woman is a special kind of woman who has endured a lot. The Indian woman endures much more than men, and no one else can endure it. And the social fabric has become such that today we speak shamelessly about this matter. Some say, "Sir, give lakhs of rupees in dowry, otherwise you won't be allowed to enter our doors." Those people don't even feel ashamed in this matter, speaking in such a manner, and such things are becoming so prevalent in our society today. The more these things increase, the more poverty will come to your country. If you accumulate money by selling off a boy or in the name of a girl, you will never achieve success in it. Try and see, if a person takes lakhs of rupees in this way, he will incur some loss sooner or later, there will be some great ruin, and eventually he will reach a state where he won't be able to recover. Someone will get stuck in such a disease or someone will get stuck in such uselessness; something will happen to them that they will regret. Because disrespecting any virtuous woman, any woman of any caste, is a disrespect of Goddess Shakti. If that woman is such that she is useless and not respectable, I am not talking about her. But today, in our India, I will say that the women here are very respectable. Even now, women here don't believe in glamour and such things. There are some crazy ones, leave them aside. But most women live with simplicity, taking care of their character. In a country where people like Padmavati committed self-immolation, no one doubts it. If I go abroad and say that in our country, women committed self-immolation for the sake of chastity, what would you say? They would say that this cannot be possible. I would say, what do you understand? You don't know about those lofty ideals. You don't know those ideals. Don't try to go in that direction. If today we compromise those ideals and start running after these mad people, then I'm telling you that poverty, which was not supposed to come, will come. And what less poverty is there in these people? Do you think they are wealthy? I think no one is poorer than them. If you go to their homes and they offer a cup of tea, their hearts will sink. If a cup of tea is spent from their home, their hearts will sink. And we are generous. Even if there is poverty, someone comes to our house. So we offer them tea, water, if there is nothing else, then at least jaggery, not just food. We were traveling in the villages with some people, they were surprised! That people live in huts but their hearts are like kings'. And these people live in palaces and they are absolutely beggars. I see the daily experiences in London, that all the foreign people are in big positions, they are all in big positions. No matter how many presents you give them, no matter what you do, not a penny will come out of them. Our boss's secretary, she tells the boss, "Your grand children are coming, aren't you worried? They will surely make your entire house dirty." He asked, "Who is this house for, is it for me?" "No, it's for those who are my children." Her point was that she used to say, "As long as our grand mother didn't take a penny from us, she wouldn't let us make a phone call." And in that same city of London, you would be surprised to know that two children are killed every week. So may God save such a country's affluence. If you wish, you can go and see for yourself. Whatever it is, by looking at the solution and focusing on the divine, awaken your principle of prosperity. The principle of prosperity of this country can be fully awakened, with integrity and understanding its glory. If we do not understand it and try in vain, wishing to accumulate wealth, then the principle of prosperity within us can never be awakened. This is the practical approach for our country, to be awakened in our religion. This is the only way for our country. That's it, but when this happens - and it will, why wouldn't it? - At that time, all the countries of the world will bow at your feet and realize that the real kingdom lies in this country. Even now, when people see, their eyes open wide and they say, "So many poor people came with a clean pot, filled with milk in it, to give to us." These people cannot believe that such big-hearted people live in these villages. So, we must not lose that essence. And such is the time that we are losing it. Our children are going astray, and we are heading in that direction. At this time, it is very important to establish cooperation and restrain our children. Awaken the principle of prosperity within them and fill them with this pride. You should know why our country is poor? And its poverty won't be resolved by just giving money to the poor; try giving them hope instead. You don't need to push any poor person to run a hundred horses of wisdom; just give them some money. Otherwise, where will they go if they don't go to the liquor dens? There's no goodness in that. Therefore, understand that the element of prosperity is necessary even to endure money. Similarly, wealthy people should also consider that the money they have is given to us by the divine. We are just intermediaries, and it's given for charity. Whatever actions can be taken in this regard should be done without any special consideration. Until we receive its blessings, everything is futile. There is no grace in it. If you go to such places, your legs start to break. "You don't need to push any poor person to run a hundred horses of wisdom; just give them some money, and just see, where will they go if they don't go to the liquor dens? There's no goodness in that. Therefore, understand that the element of prosperity is necessary even to endure money. Similarly, wealthy people should also consider that the money they have is given to us by the divine. We are just intermediaries, and it's given for charity. Whatever actions can be taken in this regard should be done without any special consideration. Until we receive its blessings, everything is futile. There is no grace in it. If you go to such places, your legs give way." They think there's nothing in our house, that we'll go hungry. Don't take food from such people's homes. People should understand that the divine has placed the seat of Lakshmi within us. She resides within us. We just need to awaken her. And for that awakening, I spoke to you specifically today about the principle of Lakshmi, because it's very important. This work can only be done once the Kundalini is awakened. So why not do it? And it is absolutely essential to do it. And the time for this has come. A special thing is that the special time has come, and you are present at this special time. Make full use of this and awaken your Lakshmi element first. Blessings!
