Arrival conversation in Athens, 25/04/1993

2:47 [To a baby] How are you?
He’s brought so many Sahaja Yogis.

5:07
Shri Mataji: So many are here, so many Greeks here. It’s tremendous. It’s a great progress to Me.
Translate it.

Greece should be the first country in Europe which should take to Sahaja Yoga.
Because Greece is a – I mean it has a heritage, same heritage [as Indians]. And we have to give them faith in their heritage now. All that they have forgotten, they have to remember.
I’m sure it’s going to work out very well now with such faith [unsure].
6:09
It’s a, an important country, as you know very well, Greece is very important, politically also and military wise.
So it's important that this country should have their own heritage back on themselves. Because so many people have learnt from you before, and again if this country comes up to its own level, every body will have to learn [from them?].
So you all have to be very proud actually of Greek's land. And that you have to take the responsibility of transforming your country in a beautiful new age country.
You can do it, it's very simple.

I was happy so many dedicated people are there, here. I prayed for [unsure], about this.

Another Sahaja Yogi: We take this in our car.
