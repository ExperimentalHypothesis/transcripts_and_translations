Shri Mahalakshmi Puja. Delhi (India), 3 November 1986.

On this auspicious occasion of New Year, I happened to come to Delhi and all the arrangements that you have made, it should be a very important event. When the New Year’s begin, at that time some new thing, new concept, new understanding awakens within the human being. That happens spontaneously. Whoever has bought the idea of ​​the New Year must have been a great visionary that on such an occasion a new enthusiasm, a new thought, a new movement should be awakened symbolically in a human being. Many such new year’s came and went, new enthusiasm came, new ideas came and got finished. Whatever concepts man has had till date, except for that of God, all others were mental activities or intellectual activities. Whatever a man thought was right with his intelligence, its movement went on for some time as something new and then, for some unknown reason, that same movement harms that particular person and that society or the people living at that time. The reason for this people couldn’t understand. But today we are witnessing this very clearly. Like say religion was established. Whenever human beings have used his intellect and mental powers in the system of religion, they got bound in a field of debate on the basis of his intellect and many debates started. If truth is one.... then why were there so many sects? Why were there so many religions? Why were there so many caste distinctions within those religions? By making such distinctions, so many groups have been formed in the world which is hard to understand. If you ask someone, Sir which religion do you belong to, he will tell you the name of such a religion which you have never heard of. In my opinion, such new religions keep arising in every new year because the human beings come up with a new enthusiasm in every new year.

Similarly, our intellect has brought enthusiasm in the political field and has told new things every day. Like in the beginning it was believed that it is good if there is only one king. The kind will understand everything and everyone will benefit greatly from the king. Then I saw that the one who was made the king turned out to be evil and he started torturing. Then they said, 'King is not good. Instead of this, make arrangements for democracy. Then they established democracy. In democracy it was seen that every person considers himself as the founder, organizer and doer of that democracy. Now you are seeing how much terror is spreading in America. What level of violence is there? If you read it, you will wonder why have the conditions in democracy become like this? Why is this whole system in a mess? Afterwards the communism that came, think that it came up a new enthusiasm in the world. Now we will build a new world in which all humans will be equal and there will be no difference between them. They will be the same in everything, including the food and drink, and apart from that they will not have any freedom of any sort. If he becomes independent, then that knowledge of the self creates problems of its own so remove its independence. This can happen only when a human being is considered completely stupid. But man is not stupid. The more you try to dominant him, the more he will sit on your head. So this thing also could not be made. That also could not be made, this also could not be made. In this way wherever we see there is terror. In the matter of religion, looking at the condition of any religion, it does not seem that such a God can even exist, which is only one. For which everyone is cutting off everyone’s head, killing them. So what is this reason? When something has come into this world in a very subtle form, in a very new way, then why is this new thing appearing so dirty and filthy before the eyes of the world? Why is its condition becoming like this? What is the reason that something which is so noble and great and the people who started it were also so noble and great, where have all of them reached today?

Like in America, there is a great man whom we call Abraham Lincoln. He was a great man, a realized soul. He brought such a simple thing, such a wonderful thing to the world, did such a great job, but now when we look at what he has done, we wonder how these people have distorted it and made it so ugly. This is one thing, secondly if you see, communism was also created by Lenin and Marx, they too were realized souls. Whatever he had thought was also a beneficial thing, now instead of the benefit it is harmful now. Or even the founders of the religions were also very noble and great people and no one can say about them, no one can point towards them that they have done something wrong or they have started this thing with some wrong belief. It is not like that but why did the thing turn out like that later on? How did the diamond get mixed with the dirty mud? The diamond should stay where it is but this diamond came as if something had been done to it and it had been completely broken and twisted and it was turned into mud and after seeing these things from a distance; everyone gets surprised that all such sublime things came into existence, now science came into the world, people said that now science has come, now all our questions have been solved and after all those questions are solved, now we should not worry about anything and everything will be fine. That is not the case, we have created a monster. We have placed atom bombs and hydrogen bombs on our heads. Here this plastic and nylon which are made from it have created mountains of it, all these things which were made for convenience have become inconvenient. Because of them, diseases and calamities spread all over the world. What happened after all, why did it happen like this? All these things were made with the intention of being beneficial. This is what inspired man to create new things. This is what made him think of creating things for the betterment of mankind. What could be the reason that instead of saving him, it is destroying him completely? The reason is that as Shri Krishna has said that the conception of man or the thinking of man, the consciousness of man is going downwards and slowly it gets reduced to dust. This he did not say; I am saying this. Because today he is in reality. The assumptions made by Krishna also went to dust. Whatever Ram had put forward, that too turned into dust. After that, whoever put forward any belief which was the form of truth, which was every part of truth, all of that turned into dust.

The reason behind this is that when it falls into the human brain, there is some poisonous substance in it due to which all these things get mixed with poison. What is this poisonous substance that causes such an act? That is its limitation. Everything has a limitation and similarly the intelligence also has a limitation, that is why by being confined in this limitation, it gets suffocated and destroyed. For example, if the delicious juice of grapes is closed in a pot, then it turns into wine and becomes intoxicating. Similarly, the human brain, which is limited, gets completely destroyed if these unlimited things are put into it. This does not mean that the human brain itself is bad. It means that the limitations of this brain will have to be broken. Its limits will have to be expanded. Human consciousness will have to be broadened. It must be broad enough to accommodate the truth and it must be open. What is its aim, our attention gets disturbed? When things get limited then what is its aim, our attention does not go there. The aim of everything was benevolence of man and what is benevolence. Shri Krishna himself has told that benevolence is that which is benevolent to the spirit. Now the spirit itself is the bestowed of benevolence, but to get benevolence means through the spirit to get our benevolence. But when the spirit itself is lost, then how can we get our benevolence? Today, which is the new year, is special because the things that we are talking about today, the work of Sahaja Yoga that we are doing today, we are expanding our brain, making it great. To which Shri Krishna has said that the place of Virat is in this brain. Its roots are inside it. We are awakening those roots. Only when those roots are awakened can they fully absorb the truth. The limited nature of man can open up.

It is very easy to give lectures. It is easy to say that you should do this for the benevolence of mankind, do that for the benevolence of mankind, but it does not happen. In the end, man does not do good for himself, on the contrary, he can harm himself and harm the whole society as well. To expand this brain, there is only one way and that is to awaken Shri Atma-Ram (Spirit) residing in our heart and awaken our intellect with his light. Awaken our brain. So how it happens is that the spirit that resides in our heart is sitting as a witness and watching everything. When the Kundalini, which you call Gauri Mata, gets awakened, then after piercing the brain and piercing the Brahmarandhra (crown of the head), piercing the Brahmarandra here, the seat of God here, it enlightens that.

The reflection of God in our heart is in the form of the spirit. As soon as our spirit gets enlightened, then all around this spirit, the light of the seven chakras around this spirit, the mandals of the seven chakras also get enlightened and the peethas (seat) of these seven chakras are in our brain. Because they also get enlightened, so these seven mandalas also get enlightened in our heart. By the enlightenment of these mandalas, our nerves or our brain opens up in a very subtle way and the power of absorption in it increases. Only by the increase in the power of absorption can man stand on the truth. Till now man has not been able to stand on the truth. He hears the truth, knows it, sees it but cannot stand on it. To assimilate the truth, the spirit must be enlightened and that has happened today in Sahaja Yoga. It should be said that it happened in sahaja only, that so many people have got their spirit awakened. By awakening the spirit that power awakens within you. Within you, through which you can absorb the truth. The truth of democracy today can be awakened within you, meaning who is the other? who is the other? Everyone is us itself. Everything is within us. Now that you have attained your collective consciousness, then the truth of communism has also come in it.

When that truth comes within you and is revealed within you, after seeing and knowing it you can say, “What are the faults in this man?” And when you start knowing yourself, when you start looking at yourself, when you get your own freedom, then the truth of democracy also gets awakened within you. So freedom has come and in a way the power of others has also come in your hands. The system of others has also come in your hands and your freedom too (unclear) because you have learnt the system of your own self. Shivaji used to say that 'swadharm' (Self-religion) olkhava (recognize). Know the religion of the self. 'Swa' meaning know the dharma of your spirit, and the dharma of the spirit is called self but it is universal, it is the spirit of the world, the spirit of the universe resides in our hearts. As soon as it awakens, the spirit of the universe which we used to consider as a great lofty example and a great philosophy, which we knew as a philosophy, is present within us. He shone within us. We don't need to read any book for it, we don’t need to find out anything about it, we know as soon as we see him, where he is, what is happening with him, what is his case, sitting here you can know the whole world. There is nothing very surprising about this. There is nothing special, if you say this about me then I will say that I have not done anything because I am what I am, I have been like this since time immemorial. So I have no specialty. The specialty is in you people that you have known, accepted and achieved this. But once you acquire the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, it does not end. The knowledge is attained, to have the knowledge means to know it on your nervous system. This is done. On the nervous system, you know what problems others have and what problems you have. This is the knowledge attained. Those who follow the opposite path think that acquiring knowledge means that we have to know with our intellect. We have to know with our intellect. Knowing with our intellect means that we will know by reading books or we will know by sitting with a guru or we will know by listening to someone's teachings. They cannot know. Gyan (Knowledge) means knowing it in your nervous system. This is the word 'gnya’. This is the 'veda'. This is the 'vid', this is enlightenment. This is Buddha. That is, today you are a Buddha because you have got enlightenment.

To have enlightenment does not mean that someone has forced the enlightenment upon you saying, yes do it this way, do it that way, do that, and whatever was told to you before that all that has gone to waste. Someone told me, yes sir, don't eat in the morning. Eat in the evening. Someone said, eat in the morning, don't eat in the evening. People kept talking about all this and such things that sir couldn't understand. Some say eat in the morning, some say eat at night, some say do this, some say do that and nothing gets done but the one who says this has not developed any special quality in his character. His nature did not change at all. So just yesterday I found this thing in Mahavirji. Mahavirji has said that first acquire knowledge, so all the Jain people thought that acquiring knowledge means reading books. Read this, read that, right knowledge, so and so. Should right knowledge come just by saying right knowledge? It will come from inner awakening, right? Right knowledge means integrated. Till the time all your chakras are not integrated, right knowledge cannot come. So, their thoughts were also destroyed. Firstly, he said that one should acquire knowledge. Then started moving towards knowledge. Here, there are many scholars. In Marathi it is said 'padhat murakh' (one who reads is fool) One became a fool by reading. “padhee padhee pandit murakh bhaye” (By reading a priest becomes a fool). So it does not come out of the head. It is so well taught that sometimes when some educated people come, I tell them to do this, you keep saying this for two days. Whatever is there in your head, you must first tell me. It will come out of the head, then we can talk because others have already entered their heads, so how can these be made to enter?

This is how our intelligence starts moving in such a way that apart from the thing that was told, which is the goal, the first thing that they told is 'knowledge'. To get knowledge. What does it mean to get knowledge? To get knowledge means awakening. So how will it happen? No one asked how knowledge will be attained? Even Shri Krishna did not say clearly that the Kundalini should be awakened, that was not the time. He only talked to Arjuna, did he not say it for the world that he would sit people people down and recite the Gita, only to Arjuna he said it. Arjuna was a realized soul. He talked to him and he did not talk to the non-realized. He talked only to Arjun and you tell all those in the world who have not realized, who are blind, you tell them that you have a snake in your hand, leave it.

You should leave them. You can never leave them. So it hasn't even started. Nothing has started yet, when it started then you saw that yes, okay, as soon as you opened your eyes, there is a snake in your hand, you let it go. On the contrary, people keep holding on to the snake as long as there is blindness, blindness means that there is no awareness in your veins, till date that awareness of the collective consciousness has not come, till this awareness is a new dimension, a new dimension, till this is not awakened within you, any truth feels very good to hear. What we call is entertaining. It is very entertaining. But it does not enter inside. It does not settle inside. You will listen to the lecture for the sake of listening and when it is over, you will be back to where you were! Now the first thing that you had realized is that after realization, your character is formed automatically. They have even confused that. Build the character, build the character, while building the character, build their character too. Somebody said wear a turban, somebody said wear saffron clothes, somebody said keep a ponytail. Some Christians told them to wear a hat like this and roam around. Who knows what all? Now they are doing everything. They have done all the rituals and now they see that they are moving towards hell. After doing all the rituals, everyone is making their way towards hell.

I have not seen any religion till date that is ascending towards heaven. All are going straight towards hell. When its been asked from the Christians, "why do you drink alcohol?", they replied, "what is wrong with alcohol? Jesus Christ made alcohol and gave it to people. I asked him when he made it. He said, "he went to a wedding and he served wine to the people there." Now in Hebrew language it is called wine – its juice – grape juice is called wine. In the Hebrew language. Now think, this is a matter of using intelligence, think if something is created in a moment, how can it be alcohol? How can it be wine? Alcohol has to be rotten. Alcohol is a non-rotten thing. Only from rotten grapes can be made. It takes time to rot. He just put his hand and gave it to me. Like what happened with your mother also, we had recently gone to Rome. So the government there helped a lot and they asked me to broadcast it. The director said, "First you give us the realization. Then we will do everything for you." I said okay. So I said first get water. I put my hand in the water. He drank it and asked, “Is this water?” I said, “Yes, why?” “No, it tastes like wine.” He kept asking me again and again whether it was water or wine (unclear), I just gave him water. Then he drank it. Then he kept saying it again and again. Then he even announced.

After that, he also said in his TV show that, “when she put Her hand in the water, it tasted like wine, but wine means not like alcohol. It was like grape juice. So it was made. Now, when they talk about Christ, it seems as if he was in-charge of some bar. Similarly, it is there in every religion. Now in Sikhism it is said that you should keep a Kirpan (Saber) for your protection. Because at that time they were all kinds of attacks on them. Now there are guns, cannonballs and all the violent things in the world. as though they are worshipping Hitler. Nanak sahab did not say this. Although Nanak sahab did not say this either, but if we look at it from the perspective of everything else, it was never said anywhere that you should keep an artillery. What calamity befell you? When there was a calamity he had said that just keep a kirpan (Saber), it is enough in the name of God. And no one used the kirpan (Saber). No one used it. For protection, he said, as a symbol you keep it. Earlier, when we were small, people used to teach us that the kirpan (Saber) was so small. Now I see its size increasing. As it increased day by day, nowadays the situation is such that it seems like an artillery house is kept. It is this much as I have grown in age, even at this age I am amazed to see that when did its size increase to such an extent. Now he had told me to keep a kanga (A small wodden comb). The comb has become so small that it cannot even be seen. And these cannons have become so long. So why do these circles of the intellect always go into the wrong things because the consciousness of man always goes downwards. But after Sahaja Yoga you have to make your character your own. Now if someone says no sir, we will not make it. It is not possible. It will be formed on its own. Your kundalini will keep making you. Slowly slowly slowly you will have to become like that. She will say that you do not become good like this. Those crooked fingers will even extract ghee and will treat you in such a way that you will say, "I am defeated, whatever you say".

There was a gentleman who gave up alcohol on the second day itself, so after that he went to Germany. He said, let me taste it a little. He really liked the wine. He said that when I drank it, I vomited so much, mother. I asked, "Why?" He said it as if, "I ate some buch (hindi word meaning unclear) " “Have you ever eaten buch (hindi word meaning unclear)?” He said, “No, we are doctors, so when we open food, the smell comes from it, I thought I ate it all and I vomited again and again, vomited again and again, I vomited so much that I bled.”And  I said I hold my ears , from today onwards I will never touch this liquor." I did not say anything, nor did I make anyone vomit. You yourself are standing on the absolute truth. What can I do about it? If you become clean, then you do not like anything dirty after that. Things start happening on their own. There are a lot of problems in the beginning. Some people face a lot of problems. While getting into this, someone gets egoistic and starts jumping around strangely. I keep watching, right now he was sitting comfortably and now he starts jumping like a monkey. Then I see in some people a kind of wickedness comes, in some people a lot of anger comes, in someone something but slowly slowly they become soft and things get under control. How it is formed, what it is formed, that I will not tell you. But it is formed because if I tell you, you people will get scared. Its ways are very delicate. But they are very difficult. For example, we never think about how flowers bloom? How do thorns come with them? How are trees formed? How do beautiful leaves get there in shape? We never think about this. When it happens, we see, “Ah! How beautiful nature is! We have come to such a beautiful natural place!” Everyone keeps thinking this but they do not think how it was created? Which power could have created it? With what beauty it was created? And what an explosive what a am dreadful power there can be behind. There can be something in it which can stop this thing from being made, so there must be something to kill it. Some such power is also associated with it which is always standing for its protection and safeguard. You will keep having such experiences and your character will keep developing. There was a person who left everything after Sahaja Yoga but could not leave smoking. So one day he was travelling in a car with some other people. He was smoking a cigarette. While smoking, he met with an accident in the car. Nothing happened to anyone. Nothing happened to him. Only his finger which the Vishuddhi was cut a little. Then he understood what the matter was. In this way, gradually through things, through teachings, you learn that this character of ours is going a little here and there, the motor is not on the straight path, it is slipping a little here and there. Then you fix it, then you fix it. While doing it, you come in such a state that you become an expert in both the things, the accelerator and its brake. You become a master. When you have that mastery, then you should understand that you have become a driver. Now you have just become a driver.  To become a master, you should get into the state of Nirvikalpa . When you descend into Nirvikalp then you are Guru Maharaj. I do Namaskar to all of you. All of you will become Gurus by acting as your own Guru, teaching yourselves and explaining to yourselves. You have not become Gurus just like that. It is very easy to teach others. But just like in our colleges we first study from teachers, then we study from professors, work hard and then we become a Guru, similarly in Sahaja Yoga also, first we experience it all,  experiment with it and then we become Guru and when we reach the gravity then we know everyone that yes we were also like this, we know you. Yes, yes ours was like this, it was like this. This was the case. We all know. Then it becomes very easy. Then you become a Guru and it should be said that the character of Sahaj is formed and by getting knowledge in Sahaj, it(unclear). Until this thing does not come, the specialty of the person does not come.

But now you see, when you become a Guru, then you realize that there are shortcomings in you and then you have to do some penance and that penance does not mean that you die of hunger in it, mother would never want this, because if you want to give pain to mother, then you should stay hungry. There is no need to stay hungry. It is not necessary to remain hungry. Yes, if you do not want to eat then do not eat, that is another matter but what kind of penance should you do in the name of God? What kind of penance should you follow? You should do only one penance in the name of God, which means that you should make your state thoughtless.

You should cleanse yourself with meditation and make your state thoughtless. Only when you become thoughtless can this plant of yours grow. That is why many people say, 'Mother, we cannot meditate.' Then dear, you will remain half. Meditation will have to be done daily. Unless this penance is done, you cannot become completely enlightened. Till then the Darshan that is said you cannot achieve that Darshan. Till then you cannot even achieve me. Until then you will not understand us at all because as long as you have flaws, you will see through the window of those flaws. For example, if you tie a blue curtain over your eyes, you will see us as blue, if you tie a yellow curtain, you will see us as yellow. And similarly, if there is any deformity in you, you will see us in the same way. You will not see us in reality. That is my way. So, you have to think about these four things in this new year that now we have gained knowledge. Now we have to make this our character. And to make this character we have to do penance and meditation. We have to do that under any circumstances. People will say that we don't have time, but that is not the case. In a city like England where it is so cold, people get up at four o'clock, take a bath and then meditate. But in India people say, 'Okay, we will do it next year, not this year.' And as we move towards the north, we think, 'What is the need? We are sitting on the side of Kailash. What is the need for us? People from the south should keep working hard, we are sitting in the north. In the northern regional area, all the people sitting in the north should know that although Kailash is in the north, their vision is towards the south. That is why he is called Dakshina-murti (one who faces south). Therefore, you people should also bring his vision towards you. To bring their attention towards you, you should have some capability and in that capability you should have pure desire. This is the Gauri Swaroopa Kundalini, the pure desire that is inside you, you have to awaken it. This is the thing that is missing here. About which we have to be alert. That is called discipline. We know the rules and regulations of the world. How to say respectfully and say things like 'Please come to our poor house'. But we do not know that we have to bring the inner discipline. The inner discipline. It has not come because the Ganges flows here. If we live on the banks of the Ganga, who can touch us? We are residents of the country where the Ganga flows. Now who can touch us? Due to such feelings of ego, the discipline part of man has gone away. It is very important for it to flow here.

And the second thing is that because of political movements here - which have increased a lot these days - I don't know how many parties have taken place, I see every day. Today this party has come. When I come I ask, "Now, how many parties have been formed? Tell me everything, I don't understand anything." Day before yesterday I met a gentleman, he asked, "Which party are do you belong to? I said, "I said am not in any party." He replied, "I am in so and so." I said, "Okay, please tell me whose party is this. I did not even hear whose party it is." So he said, "First there was that party, then this party of his, then he had so many parties. While doing this I reached sixteen parties, then this is one of them." I said, Namaskar”! (Hello) I did not have this knowledge about all these things." So because of all these things we also become party people and today the second day is very beautiful. I had told you earlier that we now understand the relationship between brother and sister but not brotherhood. The relationship of brotherhood is less. Sisterhood and brotherhood are less. People say that if two women live together, even if they are sisters, they cannot live together but I see that men are no less. Now their fights are of a different kind, women are of a different kind. When men's fights start, it is difficult to understand where their form has come from, it is a bit strange. Like now a gentleman came and said, "Mataji, now I have a big question that this gentleman who has come, he did come to Sahaja Yoga but he came a few days ago. Now that he has come, how did he start talking so much about Sahaja Yoga?"  Now he understands more, so if he has started talking, what is the harm in that? What objection do you have? You also speak. Why don't you speak? Now they all started organizing and we did not get any chance. You do it. You also do it. Everyone can do it. This is the way of man. Women it’s different-, she was singing a song and didn't even give us a chance to sing. Both are confusing for me. So I wonder, we are talking about the sky and what are you talking about. We are going to make you stars and make them shine in the sky and you people won't even talk like an earthen lamp, then what should I say next?

I am speechless when I hear these things, I am very surprised that they are pulling my neck, they are pressing me, they are going there, they are doing this. The first thing to do to please Mother is that first of all you should live with brotherhood and sisterhood.

The first thing I have to say to you is that if for me if really want to give joy, then first of all brotherhood. Now this is how the brotherhood of Sahaja Yoga works? Someone came like this, as soon as he came you have caught bhoot, you go. He came to me, Mother, I have been possessed by a bhoot.' I say, who told you? 'I went there, they told that you have been possessed by a bhoot . Mother, take out my bhoot.' I said, you go tell them that you take out my bhoot  . You have not got any bhoot why are you after?'No, they told me that I am possessed.'Then the second person comes, Mother whoever sees me he will tell that this Chakra is cathching. Mother, is this Chakra of mine is cathching? I said, why do you tell him that? You do this, tell him that, please get your enlightenment, gradually you will become sensitive and then you will come to know yourself. Why are you after him that you have caught bhoot, you have got that bhoot , you have caught this chakra, you have caught that chakra.

Secondly, are you Sahaja Yogis who are examples of daintiness! If a bhoot came in one house, all the Sahaja Yogis ran away. When it was asked where they were running, they said that a bhoot has come., I was not going to talk about bhoots at all. From the beginning I had decided that I would not talk about bhoots, but when I went to America, there was such a Deviji that when she came to me, I told her, “Look, your Guru was very evil. They will give you some Siddhis, so stay away from them. When I came back, I saw that three thousand to four thousand people come to the Deviji's place. There are big silver pitchers at her place, they washed my feet with them. I took them to their house and I see bhoots sitting there. Then I said, what are you doing? People told me, “She tells the number of the horse and if someone loses money, she tells them and beats people with a whip in her hand.” I said, “Mother, you come home.” Called her home. So I said, “Okay, tell me about them, tell about them.” Whatever she told was a lie. She got scared and asked, “Mother, did you take away all my powers?” I said, if you have your own powers that’s to be respected but this was someone else's power that ran away in front of me.” But, “I want the ultimate.” I said, "Okay, that's fine! Say it three times. I want the ultimate! I want the ultimate!" But she was possessed by the bhoot of popularity and she became that again. Now she is in a mental asylum. So what I mean to say is that you people should make yourselves so powerful that the bhoots run away. You saw that when a Sahaja Yogi was coming, all the bhoots got up and ran away from Delhi. Thousands of them will run away. But you must be powerful. You are afraid of bhoots so what will happen if they don't sit on your head? One man with a bhoot came and all of them cowered away. That bhoot person came inside. So this is a matter of brotherhood. Now what is the reason for this? Why are we weak? Because we do not have the power of Sangha within us. That is why Buddha said 'Sangham Sharanam Gachhami'. The power of Sangha should come within us. Whatever we are, all of us should together(unclear) . You must have heard so many stories about how many people from the Sangha have done great work. You must have heard about a bird that there were many birds and they got trapped in a net. They thought that if we all spread our wings together then we can be freed from this net. We will take it by flying. And in this way it flew away and then they said to the mice that if you help us then we will be free from this trap. Then all the mice together bit it and they got freed. Similarly, we should also think that if we increase our collective strength then why will any bhoot come here? He will run away beforehand. Not just one but thousands of his caravans will get up and leave from here but our collective strength is less. That is why we are weak. We do not think that Sahaja Yoga is growing. So let us join hands. Sahaja Yoga is growing; they are growing it. Let's go and attack him. He is so and so, write a letter against him. To your Mother, Mothers head gets stuck in this, if you read the letters you will be surprised. Seven-page letters come to tell that he who is working is a bhoot . Now do  I understand or not  who is a  bhoot and who is not. But this kind of talk that we are having in Sahajayogi that their vibrations are not good, this is not theirs. I say that even if thousands of such people come here, there is no need for you to be afraid.

We have a gentleman named Dhumal here in Maharashtra, so I started saying, where do you people catch bhoots from? You catch the bhoots! How do you catch bhoots ? So once in Rahuri a man came, he was possessed. So when he came there, he started saying, “These three Sahaja Yogis go through that route. That’s where we stay . So tell them not to go from there, otherwise where will we go and stay?” These three Sahaja Yogis go from there. On that, he said that we are the ones who live on that tree. If these people go from there, where will we be? This is the miracle of the three Sahaja Yogis, so you are such so many Sahaja Yogis and if you are, then who has the courage to go to any Sahaja Yogi. Increase your collective strength.. Inside whatever fear is there , remove it . With fear you  go to the left side and you get possessed by bhoots.. What is there to be afraid of? What is there to be afraid of? Many of our fights would end if we were not afraid of anyone. The fight between us will end if we do not fight with that person. There is a fear among us that our position will be spoiled. There is no politics here, there is no position here, whether today someone is going to become the Prime Minister, or someone is going to become the Deputy Prime Minister, or someone is going to change the minister, or all those who are holding their own positions in the situation. Here the job is to establish everyone's chair. Whoever has been given a seat, it will be your job to establish the seat. So when you are going to be established by brotherhood, then why stay in brotherhood? Last time I was joking with everyone. I said, tell me whom you are making your brother. Now leave it , you have made many sisters ., Now make brothers and sisters should also make friends. Earlier, having friends among sisters had great importance. These days, the word saheli (friends among women) no longer exists. Ask any woman, “do you have any Sahelis ?” “I don't have any Sahelis”. I said, “Why? Why don't I have Sahelis?” “The thing is, who can keep up with a Saheli these days?” And that is why it is impossible to have bondings among women. If there are two women then I will lose my head. The difficulty becomes that I don't know from where they get all the bad things, then the second thing is that the manner of a man is very open but sometimes very explosive. His mannerisms can sometimes cause great harm. But the way women penetrates is deeply from within. For example, recently one woman came and told us, “A Sahaja Yogini had come. So she was telling us that a girl in Australia who was married, left her husband.” I said, “This and the fifty-one marriages that took place, which went well, are not news. According to the way of newspaper, whatever is bad should be written in big letters in the very first line. Then she will go here, 'See, you heard, that so-and-so's marriage got broken.' Now, fifty-one marriages took place and they went well. Where did you hear from? Then she will go to another place, 'Did you hear? This happened'. No one says, talk about the arrival of God.' Sometimes talk about the coming of the Lord. Not that. All these people say is that that  went wrong. "You know that, that happened to them. I was stunned, how did this happen?" Because of this, women are very afraid among themselves, they have fear .. They are afraid of how to tell them? If they make something at home, they will keep it hidden. If they see this, it should not catch an evil eye. Fear starts among themselves and because of this fear, so many women tell whoever needs to be told that they are in trouble. They are in trouble. They are worried all the time. You leave it. Keep trust in each other. Trust each other. Trusting each other is the rule of Sahaja Yoga. It is a rule. Now see that so much money is collected in Sahaja Yoga. We also give a lot of money and there are  trusts for this . You will be surprised that I have never seen the accounts of the trust. Till today. I don't even know how much money there is .. However, our brother is a chartered accountant. I tell them you see what you have to do. He comes to me and says, “Hey, what are you doing? People are so miserly  that they don't spend even a single penny and why are your Sahaja Yogis so miserly ? Income tax will be on them.” I said, “We will also bring income tax under Sahaja Yoga.” So Sahaja Yogi says that where to spend the money, no one is ready to spend. I said, “Make some arrangements. Spend some money so that it becomes alright.” But I am telling you, trust . People used to tell me, “Look mother, you should look after the accounts.” I said that I never knew accounting. I didn't even see it. Whatever has to happen, let it happen but never a single penny was misappropriated from here to there. There is no problem. Here in this Hindustan, you ask anyone, “, will I get the land?” “No, he eats money.” Went there, “Will that work be done? Will we get the tap?” Then they said, “He eats money.” He eats money. I said, “Does he eat some food or does he only eat money?” Everyone keeps eating money. So even in such a situation, not a single penny of Sahaja Yoga goes from here to there. Not a single coin from here to there.Our brother himself is surprised that 'we do so many such chartered accountancy work in thousands of places. There is no hanky panky, no mess, nothing. All the legal works. 'Where did this come from? Where did this honesty come from? Where did this come from? This is the character being formed inside automatically and second this is the trust of mother. Mother trusts. This is how you trust each other. Don't look at each other's mistakes. Don't exaggerate them. Tell the goodness of others. Just think, what is good about that woman or our friend from morning to evening? What are the good qualities? This does not mean that you should blame yourself. Many people also have this habit that I am the one who is bad. not at all. You are very wonderful. The first thing is that you should not look at your faults but look at what is good in the other person. What are his good qualities? You will be inundated by it. You will be nourished by it, but if you keep counting the faults of others every day, then all the faults will be visible within you. Therefore, in making friends, in loving others, in conversing with others, with a feeling of love, if you work it out then Sahaja Yoga can spread very easily. You can achieve this very easily and Sahaja Yoga can spread widely all over the world. You can achieve this very easily and Sahaja Yoga can spread all over the world. All my responsibility is on you. What can I do? If I could do something, why would I ask for help from you? But I tell you that today, on this auspicious occasion, is such a beautiful occasion that today is also the new year and today itself it is matter of brothers and sisters. Now there is no need to tell much about this in India, there are one or two such people who are useless people. They do not understand brothers and sisters. Leave them alone. They will not understand today. If they don't understand it in India, they will never understand it, but whatever you people want to understand, the brothers and sisters you are making today, Bhaiyya Dwij (festival of brother and sister), whatever you are celebrating on this day, you should think that it is a matter of brotherhood. Many stories have been written on brotherhood in this country. How people worked together. The entire Gandhiji's revolution , the entire Forty-Two movement. Imagine how much sacrifice people made. My father was involved in this .. I told you earlier also. So the situation was that while we were living in palaces, we went  and lived in huts, but the whole city supported us. The whole city. Go to a shop, 'Hey, what money are you giving? You will give the money later when your father will come. Go to buy a saree,' 'Hey, sister, take the saree, what's the matter.' Give it when your father comes.' They did not allow anything to be missed. Everyone used to take it in their hands. That is, government servants, policemen all together. We will inform you in advance that we are going to come to your place today. So, we have received orders that we are going to come to arrest you or we are going to come to your place to search, so remove everything. In advance. The news would have come twenty-four hours in advance. Remove all the things from here. They themselves would bring their car pick up the stuff and take it in the same car Where did they go? Where did those Indians go today? If you did all this for that freedom, then there is a need to do penance for the freedom of the whole world and the biggest penance is mutual love, mutual understanding, mutual unity, congeniality. If someone falls ill, run towards him. If someone is in trouble, everyone run. There should be sharing of anything. It should be remembered. For example, when you sometimes give me sweets or give me something, then I have a thought that, 'I am eating but Sahaja Yogis might not be getting sweets everywhere' and sometimes I have a thought that, 'The Sahaja Yogis of London like these laddus very much, so they will not eat them today. Leave it.' I also feel like 'What is it, all the Sahaja Yogis of London eat these laddus (Indian Sweet) very fondly. Now if I go, I will make them and feed them only then I will eat them.' So I am not able to eat. This kind of heartfelt closeness is so satisfying and so blissful in a way. When one gets rid of the way of living for oneself and gets the way to live for others, then only man becomes vast and you can achieve this vastness through Sahaja Yoga. And today on this new day, we should keep this special message in our heart that from today onwards we will become vast and this vastness should settle in our heart and through this we all can see all the Sahaja Yogis we are. We all brothers and sisters are sons of one mother. Tied together by a thread. Very beautifully, connected with togetherness all are lovely–lovely flowers. When we will have such beautiful feelings towards ourselves. And towards others too, only then can a beautiful necklace be prepared. If any single flower gets spoiled in it, it will create a problem. So everyone should follow this belief and my eternal blessings that all of you will achieve this special form.
