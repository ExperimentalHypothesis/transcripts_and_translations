Talk to Sahaja Yogis in Taipei (Taiwan) 21 April 1994.

[... various voices - inaudible ...]

Shri Mataji: My God, it is very nice in this country, very nice. You can open the door, yes. But that door should be closed because otherwise it is ...

Yogi: Yeah.

Yogi: Yeah, this side.

[ A Chinese voice - some whispering - inaudible ]

Shri Mataji: Now the two ladies, the saris for the ladies. This you should give to the artist because she really learned it better. And this for another lady. This sari ...

Yogi: Both are not here, all gone. How did she did?

Shri Mataji: Now she's here.

Yogi: The baby also.

Shri Mataji (gives presents): May God bless you! May God bless you! She is so emotionally touched, eh? I hope you like it with more artistic work, all that. The hands and [inaudible]. This is the, this is the end of it. Very good, when she .... Because it is such a hot country I bought something, like this, is also very cool, very cool. Ah, see that.

Shri Mataji: So, yesterday was a very, I must say, a very heartening program for Me, more than successful.

Shri Mataji to the translator: "Can you translate?"

Shri Mataji: Because the people who were there were quite serious type, I felt they were listening to Me with great concentration. And it was first very hot, very, very hot - because the heat was coming out, I think. But later on it subsided - and it became very cool when they got their Realization. I could feel their coolness even sitting down there. That shows, you see, that these people have problems because of their fast life they have here, the speedy life they have. And they have a kind of a - what you can say - a stress and strain. And they have taken to this modern life, modern culture, which is not suitable for Chinese or Indians. It's not suitable for anyone whatsoever.

So, in the Sahaj culture, you see, we take it in a very balanced way. I find, on the whole, Chinese are the same culture as Indians have about. So, you see, it is easier for Chinese to take to Sahaj culture. And the attitude - Sahaj attitude - of witnessing everything, keeping in the center. I feel yesterday, that people have very bad livers or diabetes here. Because they think too much, very money-orientated. So, first of all, when they come you should try to give them Realization, move their left up and right down, like that - from the backside. That will really help them, but also the liver treatment of ice. Also you can put ice on the left-hand side of the head, and on the backside for the eyes. For your eyes also if you put the ice on the back.

This glasses you may not need at all, may not need at all. Because you eat fish too much, in India also Bengalis are the same, they eat too much fish. So, they were very short and they were wearing glasses - that's they are. Same style: great artists, very good at delicate work, music very delicate, everything - the same way as the Chinese. And so many of you look like Bengalis: high cheek bones, small eyes, exactly the same. If the Bengalis come here you won't be able to recognize them. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Now, you see, they have improved also - the Sahaja Yogis. Their eye-sight has improved. So, what you have to do is to take out the heat from the body. You can take out from the liver, you can take out from the pancreas, from the brain and from the back-side [optic chiasma ?]. So, you can take out from everywhere - putting the right hand towards the photograph. If you can get an ice; do you get here ice? - Ice - hot water bottle - they have an ice-bottle also.

Yogi: They can also buy ready-made ice in plastic.

Shri Mataji: That's good.

So that, you see, once your health improves, your eyes improve, everything, then others will also see it. You see, it's a proof of Sahaja Yoga. Also there is pollution problem. - Pollution. So, with pollution it is affecting lungs. But with this treatment of cooling down your system, even the lungs will improve because there is a right-heart will be affected.

As I told you, we have three medicines in Ayurveda which cools you down. So, when you are coming there we'll get you those, how many people need it she will tell us. These three medicines should be taken for a month, of August. I mean, it should be a very - you can call it a liver-diet month, liver-treatment month - August.

I don't know if he'll send them to you from India, if you have any problems with customs or anything.

Yogi: No, no, Shri Mataji. No.

Shri Mataji: Medicines - so, we can send it in your place, somehow ... We'll ask somebody to send it because I won't be there, but we can. So, in the month of August you plan up - all of you - treat your liver, that's the best.

Even, I mean, I must say, despite the heat and all those things your livers are better than the Western people. (Shri Mataji laughing) Western people have really horrible livers, no doubt. (Shri Mataji laughing) So, once you feel better with your livers, you can do much better with others also, because they all had yesterday liver very hot. So hot it was, I was perspiring all over. But for liver-people they should never use the candle. No sunlight. They can sit in the moon-light, but not sun-light; and should look after their Agnya by forgiving.

[Hindi aside]

Now our whole thing is, how you people are - they will see. For them I am something beyond. So, that's always so. So, one should not also frighten them, like he was telling Me he just said that, in Sahaja Yoga nobody is a sinner - they are half run-away. (Shri Mataji laughing) They wanted to be sinners, you see. (Shri Mataji laughing + laughter) But best is to make them sit before, you can take the tape and play it, translate it - slowly, slowly. So that they settle down with a tape. Then ask them to meditate. And then ask them if they are getting Cool Breeze or not. Just ask them. And then raise their Kundalini. Don't touch them. Raise their Kundalini. But don't tell them that you have to do this or that. Just it will clear out.

Now, supposing that their Left Vishuddhi is catching, than you just ask him, "Do you feel guilty all the time?" You should not. But for Christians, if you tell them, "You are not sinners," then they are finished. Because now the Church always says so. Now, they say a lot of things. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Aside: Now you'll be able to translate it.

Shri Mataji: And it's a very important work now. You see, only by this you can transform people. I felt yesterday they were all sitting there with big stress and strain on their heads. I felt that. So, don't say anything, that would disturb them, but sooth them - it's the best, soothing down. Now, they see us like this, they are being convinced that they are sinners now. So, they just can't get it into their heads that, "We are not sinners." You see, "how can that be, how Mother is saying we are not sinners?" You will notice I seldom use this word 'sin'. Because it has happened like that, that they think they are sinners, there is no redemption - so, what's the use of becoming good? "In any way, we are a sinners." (Shri Mataji laughing)

And also you should not laugh at their stupidity; sometimes they can be very stupid. So, the way they asked him questions was, "How to do meditation?" I said, "You don't have to do it; you have to be in it." So, the Mantra is for that is, "Mother, You are thoughtless awareness." That will remove their thoughts and they will be peaceful. And they will meditate better. Because so far, you know, with these religions all over ... and their conflicting effects. They are so conditioned and also confused. They were telling Me about Shinto-religion, where they worshipped their, their - what? - ancestors.

Yesterday, a boy came and he told Me very interesting thing, that he is possessed by bhoots, by spirits. And there are two other boys, or other people - one girl and one boy - who are possessed. And they, the bhoots, they moved things from here to there, there to there. And they are talking to them in their ears. These are the devils which Christ took out, you see, sort of thing. But this fellow's thing was very interesting because he said, "We wanted to commit suicide. And we could not," he said, "I could not get cool because I did not forgive those bhoots, those devils. And they talk to us, and they tell us, 'We are Gods.'" I'm sure these are the ancestors, which are following them.

Otherwise, why should they go once, once [ inaudible ] And why should these children be caught up? So, that shows that these ancestors are catching. They are interested in these children. They were very young, twenty years of age, imagine. And they were just shaking before Me like this. Then we took out the bhoots - and I asked him [ to put to My hand that side, ] right hand, left hand towards Me. With a candle - they run away. He said, "They are gone now, they are no more there." So, I asked him to cover himself up with something else; and then go, so they won't recognize him. They are stupid fools, you know, these spirits also. I mean, these spirits (Shri Mataji laughing) - such stupid fools. I've done this with many and I have seen that it works. And the Kumkum on the head. That also the bhoots run away. So I have told him, that you take the Kumkum vibrated and put it on the gates of this cemeteries. The bhoots won't come out. (Shri Mataji laughing) That would be a nice idea.

And I don't know the Bhuddists because Buddha always had a light. He always had Kumkum. And Sahaja Yogis went to this - caves we have near Bombay, [called ] Elephanta. And there is a very big statue of Shiva. And when they entered in they said, "We were surprised, that there was light here." As you know we have had lots of miraculous photographs. Of course, one was there when in Ganapatipule this Madonna was standing before Me like a light. Also there is, My face is not there, there's only the sun. That is the sign was given to Jews and Kalaki - described like that. Kalaki has no face. And Jews also, they knew the one who is going to redeem them.

But you see, those people who are dull, who have no purpose in life, who do not seek, such stupid people - even can doubt everything. (Shri Mataji laughing) They cannot believe that some miracle can take place. But now I want to show you one photograph that was recently taken in Brisbane, where appeared a rainbow. And I was there, and somebody took the photograph, and very surprisingly, there is the photo - there is the painting upwards to Me.

[Hindi] Kalki. [Hindi]

Is amazingly in some painting - I don't know, may be of Michelangelo, or anything - of the mother and the child is in the sky. Very clearly. Now, this Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things - I don't know what to say. (Shri Mataji laughing) Unbelievable this one. Leave it to them. But the non-believer cannot grasp it. You see, it's a kind of a growth and entirety of a person, which can achieve it. Who is a seeker. It has to be that growth, otherwise it cannot ...

Shri Mataji aside: Show them also! Show around. Show everyone.

Shri Mataji: You also see?

It is sometimes conditioning, it's sometimes ego - but it is going too far because there are so many, so many miraculous photographs. There is one in which Ganesha is standing behind Me, with His big, big eyes. One is on My body - it is absolutely Ganesha. Only you can see the Sari down. So, these are living Deities, they are not just imaginary.

And also the Shinto-Religion they have those Gods, they are all the same. But I don't know what they have made of them ... [I don't know, something.]

Now, for the Buddhist you should ask them to ask one question - it was future Buddha, is described as 'Matreya'. So 'Matreya' is three Mothers together: Ma-Treya. So you just ask the question, "Mother, are You Matreya?" That's all. It answers, it's - your body starts acting like a computer. Just answers all the questions, even if you are not a Realized soul.

The sensitivity, I don't know, is much more among Russians because they are not so materialistic, perhaps. They are so sensitive! Doctors, lawyers, professionals - above all, the scientists. 250 scientists are there in Moscow, and 300 doctors, what do you say to that? And they don't want to here anything about medical science, "Tell us about parasympathetic all the time. Tell us about the Divine."

Aside: You can do it [ inaudible ].

Shri Mataji: When - once Gregoire was in Austria, I think, there the doctors told him, he had pain in the thing, that they have to remove the whole thing from here to here. (Shri Mataji laughing) That's it. He said, "Mother, what should I do?" I was in America, luckily. He said, "Now they are going to take out my whole gums and everything from here. Then I am going to loose the whole of it." About what sort of doctor it was given. He showed it to many, but all of them said the same. So he said, "What to do, I have no leave also." So he said, "Gregoire, now you have to tell some lies. Of course, it is not a lie also, that you should say that my friend has telephoned to me, that there is an expert doctor in America, and I want to have leave to go to America, let me try that." They had to say yes. So he took leave and came to America to the expert doctor. And God cured in fifteen, twenty minutes. Otherwise they were going to remove him his gums. Imagine, Gregoire without gums.

Recently, I was in Brisbane again and somebody told Me that one Sahaja Yogini has been admitted in the hospital and the doctor was saying that she'll die within one hours time because she has meningitis. I know [ Aradhna ?]. I said, "All right, she's not going to die at all." After one hour she was perfectly all right. She went out of it.

But you must have a quality of faith. Seeing everything, even if you do not have the quality of faith it doesn't work in you. That's only, I think as William Blake has said that, "These are a special category of people. A special category of people, men of God. They will become Divine and they'll make others Divine." Hundred years back He said it, hundred years back. Because it's a special category of people.

With all these things also you must know that people are very conditioned. So gradually, once they'll grow in Sahaja Yoga this quality of faith will become all right, because everything is tangible. So telling all these things can be just a fairy-tale - and they may not accept you; but if you raise their Kundalini, if you give them Realization and if they become one with this All-pervading power then, you see, the quality of faith improves. And that quality of people only can be saved. Others - Divine does not have any interest. So we should also not worry about such people.

(note: a telephone is ringing.)

Shri Mataji: It's a phone calling on the line here.

Yogi: Hello? Yes hello? Yes. ... Yes, I am on the phone ... I know ...mhh ...excuse me. ... mhh ... Kuanin? Kuanin? ... ha? ... You come back? You come back? ... [late ?] ... yes. ... Ah, Shri Mataji? Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: Now you have any questions? Because Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom, you have to ask Me questions if there's anything in your mind. I'm surprised that Canada has taken so much interest.

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: One - one has sent this Ganesha.

Yogi: Yes! They just asked the people at Easter Puja, if they want to give something, and than they put it together - they are very quick type.

Translator: Shri Mataji, Mister Yang has a question.

Shri Mataji: Yeah?

Translator: Mr. Yang has a question.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, please!

Mr. Yang: [Says something in Chinese language - all laugh.]

Translator: He said he has been searching for a long time but he couldn't feel the Cool Breeze.

Yogi: He cannot feel the vibrations. He cannot feel ...

Shri Mataji: He is not feeling?

Yogi: Only a little.

Shri Mataji: [You can be in India.]

Yogi: But also he didn't ... Do you meditate at home? Do you meditate? Do you meditate at home?

Shri Mataji: Yes, meditation is it - otherwise you [do not improve.]

Yogi: Do it at home in the morning, everyday two times.

(To Shri Mataji:) He said, at home he does meditate.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: At home he meditates, he says, but he doesn't come to the meetings.

Shri Mataji: Oh, that happened! As I told you, if a nail is cut out of the body it doesn't grow. You must come to the collectivity, it's very important. Did you go to some Guru or somebody?

Yogi: He was in TM.

Shri Mataji: That's it. You can see. For TM is more necessary, because to get out of TM is not easy. Horrible, TM is the worst, I think. That's why I said why he is catching in the left. Left Swadishthana is -

Translator: He asked, what shall he do? (Laughter) What should he do? What to do?

Shri Mataji: With a TM?

Yogi: He wants, what he can do now? Treatment or meditation, what does he do.

Shri Mataji: He has a left Swadishthana, so he has to use the candle, no doubt. And the TM is to be really sort of beaten up with shoes, I think something. It's horrible.

Yogi: And he is keeping still in contact. Last year he was going to America to meditate with TMs still.

Shri Mataji: They are very ... they grip you like that. You see the people who have been to TM have lost their houses. Their children are removed from schools, they are just on the streets. And they were jumping, you see - on the mattresses and they broke their bottoms. And they demanded, you see, they demanded money for that and these people got the money. Their bottoms were broken. There was one fellow who was running their flying academy, Peter [Pears. ]

Shri Mataji to the audience: Sit down all, sit down.

Shri Mataji: Why do they want to go around at about three feet-level? (Shri Mataji laughing) All right, that failed. So now, new marketing has started: Ayurveda.

[Poor catches] talking about that. And also there is one [Prabir Chopra ?] who is going down mesmerising people. Horrible. Very troublesome.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, there's also this [GuruMaya] with Sitar-courses.

Shri Mataji: She came here?

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. All of the TM people who came to Sahaja Yoga went then to this Guru-Maya afterwards.

Shri Mataji: Aach! And now they will be caught, very badly, they will suffer a lot. Because, you see, she is the devil absolutely - she sells vibrated shawls. Her father - she is an illegitimate child of [Muktanand], she and her brother. And her father had diamonds one-six-hundred crores. Crore is hundred thousand, hundred hundred thousand - of pounds.

Aside: It is going very hot soon.

Shri Mataji: You can feel the Cool Breeze? You just come closer. Like a fan. There is a failure ...more on the right, less on the left ... left is catching, really, left is a problem. Put your left like this, and right on the Mother Earth ... [sounds like: Put it close [inaudible] Very sole.]

Yogi: Shri Mataji, they also have a thing, they go to sauna everyday.

Shri Mataji: He?

Yogi: They are going to the sauna every day. Sauna - hot, hot, hot steam.

Another Yogi: Sometimes, not every day.

Shri Mataji: Sauna, Sauna is [ inaudible ] (Laughter) Sauna bath is all right. For him heat is good. Sunlight is good. But now TM has to go away. Are you feeling the cool?

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Are you feeling fan-like thing? All right.

Yogi: [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Worst! They are going round from one to another, to another, to another - I mean marketing is sometime. We have a Rajiv Kumar in the government, he is a very high official, and he said that the secretary of one of the departments put all these into TM, and they are all suffering.

Translator: He asked, from now on, what he should do?

Yogi: He asked from now on, what he should do.

Shri Mataji: I am just telling him that he should take the left-side treatment and beat TM with shoes.

Yogi: Shoe-beating, shoe-beating. And don't go to the [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: And if he has any books or anything - you should throw them away. Ah, better now. Better?

Is this the sari you have to give Me?

Yogi: This is the Puja sari for Thee because of ...

Shri Mataji: Puja. That you have to give Me in Guru Puja.

Yogi: Guru Puja.

[several Yogis are talking, and also Shri Mataji: inaudible]

Yogi: We wanted to ask this.

Shri Mataji: [inaudible] It's all right, get it laid, get it. She can, all right. Give it to Me at Guru-Puja. It's a very nice sari, they could all see it.

[note: gap]

Yogini: Mother, I feel the Cool Breeze, but I always feel a tension inside and.

Shri Mataji: She feels the Cool Breeze?

Yogi: Mother, she feels tension, she feels the tension inside.

Shri Mataji: Tension. See, Ekadasha, you have a problem.

Yogini: Inside of the Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: You see, it is your liver again.

Yogini: Liver?

Shri Mataji: Very bad. It is on Ekadasha, is showing here, it's serious. So, left to the right you have to put it like that, to take out the tension. You don't feel Cool Breeze in the head, do you? See? But still it's the liver.

Yogini: Mother, may I have a name?

Shri Mataji: What is your name?

Yogini: My name is Elisabeth.

Shri Mataji: Elisabeth. One name of the Goddess is Priyamvadha. Priyamvadha, but you can call her Priya. Priya. Priya is the [girl ?], but Priyamvadha means the Goddess. Her Quality is to speak something that pleases you, which is learnable. Priyamvadha. And the short form is Priya.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, I also would like to get a name.

Shri Mataji: Yes, say it!

Yogi: Gerlinde, she also said - it is Gerlinde Ringhofer, she also liked to have a name.

Shri Mataji: She is ...?

Yogi: Her name is Gerlinde Ringhofer, and she wants also a name.

Shri Mataji: Gerlinde?

Yogi: Gerlinde.

Shri Mataji: Gerlinde?

Yogi: Gerlinde - "ger" means a spear ...

Shri Mataji: Ahh! (Shri Mataji laughing) Lakshmi, Lakshmi is all right. Is easier.

All right.

So, now we have to go also. It's time.

Young Yogini: Mother, may I have a name?

Shri Mataji: Yes, you say.

Yogi: He wants a name.

Young Yogini: May I have a name?

Yogi: He wants a name.

Shri Mataji: Name?

Yogi: Both of them want a name, I think ... (Laughter) Both of them want a name, Shri Mataji. The girl wants a name, and she wants also a name.

Shri Mataji: See, I - these days I don't give names, but I will now - this time - but it ... Now, a better name. The name of 'Kamala', means the Lakshmi again, Kamala.

Yogi: For the girl?

Shri Mataji: Minakshi. (Laughter) Yours is Minakshi then.

Yogini: But [my friend] is also called like this, Kamala Minakshi [inaudible]. (Laughter)

Yogini: Minakshi!

Translator: Mother, she felt a Cool Breeze on top of her head, but she has a problem in the Nabhi.

Shri Mataji: You went to some Guru, or somebody?

Yogini: Before I met You. Rajneesh.

Yogis: Ah, Rajneesh. Rajneesh.

Yogini: Ah! But I gave up, [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: Put your right hand on here, and put your left hand towards Me, and you have to say: "Mother, You are my master". Or: "I am my own master." It's better. "I am my own Master", again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again. Don't cry.

Yogini (weeping): I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: A master cannot cry. All right, say: "I am my own master."

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Correct - again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogini: I am my own master.

Shri Mataji: Better now?

Yogini: Yeah!

Shri Mataji: You know, there is nothing to feel bad - because you are a seeker. As a seeker you always get lost, but if you come back it's all right. Once you have come back you are there - all right? Better now? You get it - Cool Breeze, in the left hand? All right, this is your mantra.

Translator: Your mantra: 'I am my own master.'

Shri Mataji: He was here, Rajneesh? No?

Yogi: I don't think so, Shri Mataji, no.

Shri Mataji: But still there must be some organization.

Yogi: There is an organisation, they are selling books.

[various voices inaudible]

Shri Mataji: That organizations get this?

Yogi: I don't know, Shri Mataji if it is existing. But maybe a specialist is selling too. Rajneesh still in Taiwan? Is there an organization? Rajneesh has still an organization in Taiwan?

Yogis: Yes! Yes!

Shri Mataji: Still there?

Yogi: Yeah!

Shri Mataji: Because lots of Japanese are now working. [inaudible].

Translator: His book is published in Taiwan.

Yogini: They were publishing.

Shri Mataji: They were published here?

Translator: Right, with translation.

Yogini: And a tape; and they give you the tape - music tape.

Shri Mataji: What did she say?

Yogini: Music tape. They also show music. Music.

Translator: Rajneesh-Tape, Music, and books. They are publishing in Taipei.

Yogi: In Chinese?

Yogis: In Chinese, in Chinese.

Shri Mataji: Why shouldn't we publish our books here also? Is it cheaper to publish here?

Yogi: Ah, it is cheaper. It is not expensive.

Shri Mataji: Ah? Not cheaper?

Yogi: No, it is cheaper!

Yogis: Cheap! No, very cheap!

Shri Mataji: Then we should publish our books here. You have publishers who do that?

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: In time. In what language?

Translator: It's in Chinese language.

Shri Mataji: Somebody must have done it. [Who did translate?] Some of the smaller books.

Horrible! In the program in Japan I felt his vibrations were there. So I started talking on him, that he died of AIDS. So, one bhoot got up. She was looking like a bhoot to Me, dressed up like a bhoot, "No, he did not!" - I said, "He did." She went out.

Translator: Mr. [ Ku ? ] has a question also.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Translator: He has a question.

Shri Mataji: What?

Translator: Why he has a heart catch?

Shri Mataji: Yeah? Very right-sided.

Yogis: You are right-sided.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you see the heart catches from the right side. Put your right hand on your heart, then come forward. May God bless you! You just have to say, "Mother, come in my heart." Twelve times, "Please come in my heart."

Yogi (six times): Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: Again. Again please say it.

Yogi: Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogi: Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogi: Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogi: Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogi: Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogi: Mother, please come into my heart.

Shri Mataji: That's it. You are all right now? [Yogi sneezes. Shri Mataji laughing.]Whenever you say, I am available. You say, "come into my head!", I will be there. You say, "Come in my stomach!" I will be there. Anywhere you say - I am there.

Translator: Now he says, when he is meditating, the vibration is easy and Cool Breeze is easy - but during the day...

Shri Mataji: Yeah, yeah.

Translator: ... it is very difficult.

Shri Mataji: Then you should just close your eyes and think of Me. That's the only thing I can say.

Translator: He says, "It is very easy to catch."

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Translator: Very easy to catch, sometimes.

Shri Mataji: Then before going out you should take a Bandhan. And also meditate, and before sleeping also take a Bandhan. Put your attention to Sahasrara before sleeping, it's better. Gradually, you see, it purifies you completely. You have to have patience, that's all.

Yogi: He tries to cure people.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Yogi: He is trying to cure people. He is trying to cure other people.

Shri Mataji: Aya ... he should take Bandhan and he can do it, but don't touch them. Best is to give them photographs. That's all. Them also a Bandhan. Yourself, and to them also. Yes, and - you can give photographs, it's the best. And tell them to meditate. Don't touch them, because they are quite complicated to begin with.

(Shri Mataji gets a present.)

Shri Mataji: What's it? Oh, you have done it! (Laughter and applause)

O My God, it's done so beautifully.

Yogi: Looks nice. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: I am not so beautiful like this. (Laughter) Very sweet. Thank you very much! You should write your name here. They are artists, I must say. Such a little girl.

Better now! Are you better? Is he better now! Are you better now?

Yogi: Much better.

Shri Mataji: Are you better now? Better. Now sit with a - never sit with a locked gate, with an Asanas. With a Sahaja Asana, like him. Sahaja Asana. Sahaja Asana, like this: Sahaja Asana.

[Many are talking, also Shri Mataji: inaudible ]

Shri Mataji: Not to lock up.

Now it's better, now.

Translator: Mr Yang says his left hand is cool.

Shri Mataji: Right hand on the Mother Earth.

Translator: Right hand put on the Mother Earth.

Shri Mataji: If it is a right-hand-problem, then put the right hand towards the photograph and left hand upwards. It's very simple - Sahaja Yoga.No, no, no, no. Left hand towards the photograph, in your case. Photograph. Towards Me, now. And the right hand on the Mother Earth. Because left side goes in the Mother Earth; and right side goes into the ether.

Yogini [silently]: Mother, Mother, Mother - You mentioned this birthmark can be cured by Sahaja Yoga treatment. (Laughter)

Yogi: She is a very little, very little kind of a nevus, very little for the colour change of the skin, and she is worried about the daughter about that.

Shri Mataji: What is less?

Yogi: Come, come on.

Yogis: Birthmark. Oh God! Birthmark.

Yogis: ... [ inaudible ] She is worried about the birthmark ... [ inaudible ].

Shri Mataji: Let's see that go away. You tried something for that? Nevus.

Yogi: Because I told her, she shouldn't worry about it, because she is a beautiful girl. She shouldn't worry about that.

Shri Mataji: Ha ha! She does. But Haldi is very good for her. You get in India something like Turmeric.

Yogi: We have here Haldi, Shri Mataji. We have ...

Shri Mataji: That cools Me also. [They doubt], they get in England, [they doubt]. These are all [itching] things, but let's try.

Yogi: Like in the marriage ceremony you put it, you make it wet and put it in?

Shri Mataji: It's - get a tube. Some are going to send Me these medicines, on the Diwali. I asked somebody to send it from Puna.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, can you repeat the names please first?

Shri Mataji: All right, write it down! The first one is Chandanas. This you have to take one spoon after breakfast. One table-spoon, or maybe small spoon. To begin with, let's start with one, yes? Then one table-spoon. Then you have to take another one which is called as Oudumber, Oudumber. O-u-d-u-m-b-e-r, Oudumber-water. That you should take after lunch and after dinner.The best start, it is the easiest to send a Sabchasi, s-a-b-ch-ai, Sabchasi. They are very cheap. Now, you soak sabchasis in the water - before sleeping. And early in the morning, just after brushing your teeth. This is also one tea-spoon full, you have to soak. Brushing the teeth you take that water. So much of water we do. Drink the water and also eat the sabchasis. Which get swollen up. This is for liver.

Also some people have vomiting sensation and all that, in that case. Or migraines. This, you can take it in winter: is ginger, which is mixed with lemon and salt. You could eat ginger, raw ginger.

Yogi: As a powder, or fresh ginger?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, not powder. Ginger. Raw ginger.

Yogi: Raw.

Shri Mataji: With food or something.

Yogi: Yes, they cook a lot with ginger, the Chinese.

Shri Mataji: Yeah. But also powder of ginger - you can take early in the morning before anyone else, with sugar. For example you press a spoon. I will show you: a little bit should be taken first of all the powder. And should be covered with vibrated sugar.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, can we offer some Kumkum to vibrate it?

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Yogi: We want to offer some Kumkum that You can vibrate it with [SOUNDS LIKE: Your feet ?]. Some Kumkum, please.

Shri Mataji: Yeah! Not only Kumkum, otherwise I also have to vibrate water. You have that water; you have your Kumkum, all right. Now we should have salt, sugar.

Yogi: Salt and sugar please.

Shri Mataji: Actually, your wife is very right-sided, she has a liver then [ very terrible ]. Better tell her that at least, bring your liver all right. What is this?

Yogini: This is Kumkum, Shri Mataji.

Yogi: It's Kumkum.

Shri Mataji: So much? (Shri Mataji laughing) All right.

Austria will have the Sahasrara-Puja, do you know that? (Shri Mataji laughing)

[Hamid, you know, Hamid wants.]

Hamid's idea. He wants to have My birthday, imagine, 21st March! What will be the temperature? (Shri Mataji laughing)

Aside: How many things like that?

Yogini: To drink?

Shri Mataji: It's all right. It is all vibrated.

Yogini: Mother, Mother can I ask some vibration-water for the [inaudible].

Yogis: Yes. Okay, we have it. ....

Yogi: She wants to have vibrated water.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: She wants to have vibrated water. We have that.

Shri Mataji: Yeah.

Yogini: To clean the house.

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: That's very good also for liver. What you can do: put the vibrated water; add up more of your own, shake it nicely. If you don't touch these things with your hand it's the best. Use spoons always.

And I have to change My sari and I think, I hope to see you again, very soon.

Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: Try to come to India, if possible it's good. Was there any concession given to you last time?

Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji, there was a concession.

Shri Mataji: What concession?

Yogi: We were coming for the whole tour, and about, I think, four people got it for the half price.

Shri Mataji: For the whole tour?

(note: telephone rings )

Yogi: For the whole tour; and this tour already ten people came to Ganapatipule, and we took the half price - to people who need help. [???]

Shri Mataji: Half price ... And for the whole tour also? Just for the Eastern people they are doing like that.

[inaudible]

Shri Mataji: I am going to make free for the leaders now. (Laughter)

Translator: Shri Mataji, the jewellery store, they bring some samples to show, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Ah, he is here?

Translator: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: All right, so I'll see him, better - it is so anxious.

Translator: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All right, very good idea. Thank you very much; thank you very much!

Ask him to keep it in My purse. Give it to Me, give Me that. You get there, [keep it closed.]

May God bless you!
