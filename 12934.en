Shri Mataji:  (speaking to a little girl as She pins a SY badge on her frock)

Alright? What are you doing? What is it? Don’t take out. The frock will (..unclear)

Shri Mataji takes off the badge and gives it to the child’s mother, saying something about the child..... (unclear).

Brian, the New Zealand leader, comes to speak to Shri Mataji:

Brian:  Shri Mataji, the point that we were discussing this morning, we discovered here, that is the section which is quoted.

Shri Mataji and Brian read  Christ’s words as reported in the Bible (...unclear)

Brian:  Now this is the section:

“ I also tell you that you are Peter and on this rock  I will build My Church and the gates of Hades, the gates of Hell shall not prevail against her” ( Brian: “her” = the Church.)

“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven.”

That was what you do on earth, I will make sure it happens in Heaven! Nonsense!

“Whatever you allow on earth will be allowed in Heaven”.

Shri Mataji: This is nonsense.

Brian: This is nonsense. “Then He....”

Shri Mataji: You see, how could He say that?

Shri Mataji shakes Her head

Brian: How could He?

Shri Mataji laughs

Brian:  It must be true, Mother, it’s in the Bible!

Shri Mataji laughs.  She looks at the passage again

Shri Mataji: (unclear...) can you read there..(unclear)?

Brian: “Then He forbade the disciples to say to anyone He is the Christ”. So He wanted to keep it a secret or something, I don’t understand...

Shri Mataji: ...(unclear)...

Brian:  Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji:    What’s the meaning of Christ....(unclear) ?

Brian:  Christ is the sacrifice, the chosen one, the chosen one of the chosen people. It’s the Greek, the Greek equivalent of the Messiah.

Shri Mataji: It comes from Krishna....(inaudible)

Brian:  Krist.

Shri Mataji: And Yeshu comes from the...

Brian: Yeshoda

Shri Mataji: Yeshoda.

Brian:  It’s beautiful that. But not many Christians would believe it.

Shri Mataji: They wouldn’t agree with it.

Brian: No. No, they’d think that was sacrilege.

Shri Mataji laughs and looks at the child: “Shakti is (al)right (?)

Brian:  Perhaps Mother, we should get through now.

Shri Mataji (to the child): Bye-bye.

Brian:  Where do we go?

Shri Mataji (to the children) Bye-bye,bye-bye, bye-bye,bye-bye. We’re going now. Bye-bye

Airport employee (checking tickets): I hope you get on. If you don’t, we’ll see you tomorrow. Good trip. It’s all O.K. apart from that.
