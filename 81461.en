I think one day, Shri Mataji, her granddaughter, and I were together. Shri Mataji was doing an oil massage for her granddaughter, whose name is Anupama Nanu, and I was just rubbing Shri Mataji's feet. We were watching a movie with Hema Malini and some others. We were just watching the movie, and suddenly she asked, "What's happened? What's happened?"

We were just laughing and laughing. Suddenly, while I was rubbing Mother's feet, there were so many thoughts in my head. I don't know why, sometimes. Suddenly I felt really nervous, and Mother said, "Don't feel guilty." I don't know... it's just sometimes really joyful, but sometimes when you massage Mother's feet, you just think, "Why is this thought coming?" I don't know why it makes our brain go, but sometimes it happens.

Another time, I remember feeling really joyful. I got to massage Mother's feet, and I thought to myself, "I would really like to massage her body." And then the next time Mother came, I went there. For 15 days, I got charged. I felt like my whole body inside was frozen from massaging Mother. She said, "Do massage my back and everything." I felt so joyful. I had to phone John to say hi and tell him how I felt. It was like I didn't know where I was. Such a wonderful thing.

Regarding films, we were in America watching The Wizard of Oz once. When they all faint in the poppy field, she said, "This is prophetic. This film is prophetic."
"What's it called?"
"Wizard of Oz."

I wasn't there for this, but a few days later, Sarah told me they were watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, the science fiction movie. When HAL, the computer, really started to take over, Mother told them to turn it off. She said, "Once they take over, you'll be finished." So, that was pretty horrible.

And yet another time, watching films in Hampstead, we called around. Mother had the television on, and we were very embarrassed. There was Mother sitting there, and a beautiful, very young picture of her on the wall. And then there was Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum in River of No Return or something. She plays a nightclub singer, and there she was, with not many clothes on. It was really embarrassing. At the end, he picks her up and takes her off, and her red spangly shoe falls off. So she's going off to be a wife.

And Mother turned around and said, "Film." Then she turned it over, and it was James Bond and Pussy Galore. It was terrible. And then she said, "He's only with one. He's only with one."
