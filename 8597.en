1989-10-06 Talk to English Yogis

Today is the day of the Devi Puja and on this day the Power of Kali acts and she is the one called as Samhara Kali, meaning the one who destroys all the evil forces, so it is a very good day that we have a Puja here in England I’m very happy about it, now, I was thinking that I should talk to the UK Sahaja Yogis because very important, I’ll be completing now sixteen years of my stay in UK and I have really found such love and such goodness about you people, now next year I will not be staying here because my husband is going to be transferred and of course and I’ll be coming back, for a month or so I could be with you, maybe much more closer than I have been so far, but there’s something that I think I should warn you people because now I’m receiving lots of letters about Gavin asking why Gavin has become like that. What’s gone wrong with him? Perhaps everybody seems to quite frightened to see these things happening and to some other Sahaja Yogis also, because in other countries, when the Sahaja Yogis go out of Sahaja Yoga they don’t get after me, or they don’t get after me of Sahaja Yogis, but they think there’s something wrong with them and they feel very sorry and keep out, but why is it that Gavin has become so adamant and is becoming so much against us and I am told he’s supplying information to some horrible organisations and things like that, I mean I don’t know how to explain human behaviour It’s difficult because when you have found out something so great and if you cannot value it, what happens why? so I feel that English have so many great qualities among them because at the time of crisis they are the ones who always stood up because of them we could avert the war, second world war, was averted because of them, not only that but also they work out things at the nick of the time whenever it is necessary and their whole style is very quiet and they show results at the right time that’s a fact, no doubt one has to accept it all these qualities are there but I think there are certain other things which have crawled up and maybe that’s one of the reasons we have to guard against if you have to keep to Sahaja Yoga if you have to grow in Sahaja Yoga, so one of the things I have found out that English believe more in the style, how you, what is your style, you see, say like a cocktail style you can call it, call it a dandy style and a punk style and this style and that style, you have got tail coat style, all sorts of styles you have, its, and because too much of it in the atmosphere, too much, as soon as you see a house they’ll tell you, this is Georgian, this is ah such and such and this is Neo this and that, so you see it must go up to that style, it has to be that style you see and any house which is not to that style, then there’s oh its a compromise it’s a little, there’s a little fussy or I don’t know what all words they use to criticise such a thing, so this is one thing we have to know that styles cannot substitute a content, it cannot be a substitute, style is so outward and so, so deceptive, it is so deceptive and so outward that it deceives us also, it deceives us also, like if we feel that we are a class, or something, this class conciousness also quite a lot if you start thinning also we are class, then I mean on has to know that this is something very man made stuff, to be a class, if you say I am a class it’s all man made, it’s not the way The Divine is, Divine doesnt have all this differentiations, you are a class Sahaja Yogi means in your content, within yourself, you have such powers, that you can face yourself happily and you enjoy yourself, you know yourself, that is what is a class in Sahaja Yoga, not how you dress up or how you talk of you hold your forks, fork and spoon, its not the way, so this style that we think of is no substitute for the contents, now this thing works out better with this outside culture that we have, that you should not express your feelings, you see this is another nonsense they have taught us in this country, this is all nonsense, absolute nonsense, you should not express your feelings and you should be poised you see, ah and say somebody dead, somebody died in a friend, I mean in our circle and Mr Shrivastava went there, thank God I had no black sari so I didnt go but you must go in the black sari, in black blouse and a black everything and a black
bangles and I said, Babba I don’t have all this black, black things so what to do, I mean what is there a person is dead now he doesn’t see you whether your in black or red, you see but ah, but one thing is there definitely, that if you wear something you see, whatever you wear, you express the inside, the content within you, that your so sad and unhappy and he went and there was a champagne for that, I mean somebody is born you have a champagne somebody dies you have a champagne, I mean anyway, so champagne has nothing to do with the style, they can have at any time, but the style was you must wear black, everything black, I said this is too much, I mean at the most one could have a, some strip of black to suggest, what is there to suggest if somebody dead, I mean you do feel inside and he was looking very sick, my husband was looking very sick, because he was feeling so sad really that he had lost a friend, I also cried, so they said what’s the matter, are you not well, they were all laughing joking and the dead body was lying in the next room, so C.P said no but such a friend, but no be poised, you have no poise, Mr Srivastava and one lady
had gone, whom also shes also a common friend, she’s from Ghana I think some place and she started crying you know, naturally I would have also have also cried, thank God I didn’t go, so they all criticised her, this is not proper, she should not have done all this things and all that, so all there ideas, you see every country has some sort of a conditioning and we must realise what our conditionings are then we are alright because we have to break all our conditionings in every Sahaja Yogi they see the problems of own country this is the best thing we have and they laugh at the people who are there, but still we must know there might be some subtle things lying within us because from this case of Gavin now you can see clearly, you see he had a style always had a style for everything for Puja he’ll have a style this thing he’ll have a style, that thing he’ll have style, so I used to little bit doubt him, I said why so much worried about his style, mean for small, small things, even if he’ll wear an Indian dress, he’ll think of a style, what style it is, you see we don’t have any styles, this we have been wearing from ages what style can we have? we don’t have Georgian, this that style at all, its only one style is kurta, thats all so like you see he was more worried about the style he would put out and that’s what I am saying, that we have to understand that style cannot substitute your content, be careful, so now not to express your feelings, you shouldn’t laugh you should sit like a monk we don’t want monks here, alright, you have to really laugh aloud and enjoy and show your expression of your enjoyment, if you cannot laugh it out, if you do not know how to enjoy your spirit you are not a Sahaja Yogi, finished, that’s all, if you are a Sahaja Yogi then you should be able to enjoy everything every small thing you should enjoy once we climbed a hill to go to a temple to see, it was an old temple, we went to see that and we had to climb quite a lot, my son in law, my daughter they
were exhausted, but I was enjoying everything, I didn’t feel anything I went up and then I just, we all laid down there on one of the outer side of the temples and he said I’m fed up of this, my son in law said, its too much to climb this, I said now watch these elephants see these elephants are so nicely done everybody has a different type of a tail, he said mummy how can you see tails at this time at this time when I’m so exhausted? oh, I said thats how I dont get exhausted, but you can see the tails there are different, different, I see, just now I cannot, I said you start seeing them you’ll forget it and really it happened, so one thing is, we are not any more English, or UK Sahaja Yogis, we are Sahaja Yogis of The Gods Kingdom and we know what is the truth, and we are not going to make ourselves miserable for nothing at all because some of our great grandfathers have told us to put things like this, that you have not to express your feelings, well it was not so bad I must tell you when I first came, when I gave realisation to Douglas you see if he’ll remember he lost all balance he just picked me up and put me up like that, and felt I that English have improved a lot, but Gregor was there he got nervous, put her down, put her down, so it was so simple, so spontaneous, so natural, you know, that is what we should
understand, are we natural, are we spontaneous, do we laugh a lot, do we talk in a very open way, to be open hearted is wrong according to the old stupid traditions what you must have had, its wrong absolutely wrong, I tell you, so this is one of the things we must cut out that we have no other styles, but Sahaja Yoga style is to laugh, to talk to embrace everyone and to be joyous, that’s what we are, because we know the knowledge, we are Gnostics, they are not stupid blind people, who
would wear their, black hats to go to church and sit over all the tombs there, we know such a lot, so this is first thing that we have no styles, no styles of any kind, now some Sahaja Yogis went abroad got married, from UK and I have complaints about them, that they think they have become ladies and leaders, I said eh? Ladies and leaders, they have had no jobs here how are they become ladies, they said they have, now they want to wear a kind of a hat and they want to wear this kind of a thing and some of them have become hippies, I said hippies, why? I can’t understand and they don’t want to talk to anyone and they are stiff upper lip all English styles you see, I said I hope they are not wearing tail coats, borrowed from this Moss Bros. So it was very sad because they would not go to any collective programmes because, they would not, they have become now sahibs you see, in India they are called as sahibs, in India if somebody tries to show too much style or tries to show that he’s some class they say now he has become a sahib, you see he has become a sahib, sahib means it’s condemnation, in India. It is condemnation, but that’s what it is you see, its come from English only, because English would talk like that you see sometimes in such a manner that, even he might be just a butler somewhere but he would talk with such a big airs about him, but your not that, we have been thinking why? why? is that the English cannot open their hearts, after all you live on the heart of the whole universe, if you don’t open your hearts who else is going to open their hearts, there’s no need to be vivacious you see, talking like this talking like that it’s not needed, I am not saying that, that please understand but I am saying in a proper dignified manner, you have to laugh you have to joke, you have to enjoy, because there’s no joy inside that’s why it is so, is it not, or is there joy? because if you think, if I laugh too much what will be the sin? So this is one thing that one has to understand that all these artificialities are stupid artificialities that were there, like at the time you go to one of the queens parties, I must tell you about it because I’ve been to all this nonsense and there are people who come in there of course this Moss Bros. business again, they come in their tail coats and some get very tight ones and some get very loose ones you see, the tight ones walk with such a funny gait you don’t know what to do you feel laughing all the time, they look like jokers, I tell you, very nice dignified people look like jokers and the others who have loose ones walk like Charlie Chaplin and I can never make them out I tell you, I told C.P. is he the same, is the same why? I said I can’t make it out he’s looking so different like Charlie Chaplin, might be Charlie Chaplin might have been to one of such parties I am sure the way he had his dress made, because this is absolutely there I tell you and then they must have the tea sit down this, that nonsense you see, what I am saying that all this trickles down to us from a man made nonsensical idea, we are sitting in the Kingdom of God, so we are not going to do all these things, we are not going to indulge into all such nonsensical things because it gives such an artificial superiority and cuts you off from the rest of the world, so I have to really tell you that in this whatever has happened you see that the kind of a artificiality that was built up, the reality had to give up, you see couldn’t bear any more of that artificiality, it was too much, I have tried to find out why this difference like I have seen Jeremy and Robert, they have become real Italians, I tell you, so once we had gone for shopping and then we said let’s have some ice cream. Guido is very good at taking me to ice cream shops I never eat otherwise, so we are there and suddenly we herd a big laughter coming I said, looks like some Sahaja Yogis coming this time, it was Babba Mamma and these two coming down to the same shop and laughing so loudly that even then, even the Italians were looking at them who are these greater Italians who have come here, three of them laughing and laughing, and very quick saw and they got a fright, because they were sitting, I said I am so happy to hear your laughter all the way you came here and everybody was looking at you, because both of them know Italian language, they know another language, there’s another thing with us is that we don’t want to learn any other language, everyone will have to jolly well learn English language otherwise we think they are all stupid fools and we make fun of them I have seen so many films here they show so many little, little dramas sometimes some sort of series where the show French speaking English in a funny way or a German speaking in a funny way and also I think English can speak in quite a funny way to me sometimes its impossible, like today the ticket collector I don’t know what language he spoke but I didn’t understand
what he was talking, he was trying to be nice you see, but I was looking at him, I was about to ask him what Oxford English, of is it Cambridge English I don’t understand, that’s how, so what I am saying that language is just for communication, but in the communication if there’s no love there’s no genuineness, if there’s no feeling, concern, why do we want to communicate with anyone just a lip service, no good, so now we are not only part and parcel of this world but of the whole and everything circulates through you once you give this insular feeling, but insulation is there very much insulation, in the character, maybe because of England being an island, except as I was telling today to David, that except for attacking other people and going into up to even China up to Australia, otherwise they are insulated, so we must learn to watch ourselves we must learn what is coming to us from our forefathers, this is the inheritance we have got, so suddenly we become lords, suddenly we become ladies, ah suddenly we become some sort of an English duke, in India they made lot of fun you must have seen the Dukes nose they have got it given the name to one projection of a mountain, they call it this is a dukes nose, because some duke must have gone with a nose like that, so we must learn to make fun of ourselves then all these things will disappear and must understand that we are much higher people than this limited thing, it’s no good and if we are following these old people then we can become bhootish with them because they were quite bhoots you can see them they were quite bhoots the way they did certain things and now they are dead and gone, we are newly born, special people we are flowers and we should be fragrant and this what happened with Gavin that he’s gone down too much and this Valerie is a character which is another horrible one I just dont know what to say about her, less said the better, I mean I have never seen such a person writing such a horrible thing I have never heard that such books are written for general reading I mean in India, out of question, even one sentence like that wont be permitted, something that’s nauseating absolutely nauseating, I couldn’t read I am sorry to say but whatever I heard about it and there were a few lines they read it and I said stop it! stop it! Stop it! I don’t want to vomit, so to just to have a style and this and that it is not alright we are the Spirit and the Spirit is the light all around us, all around our auras there are people walking with a special type of a personality what do we need style for, who has better style than ours, we make our own styles, we are the makers of styles, so to conform to some sort of a nonsensical idea and to succeed yourself, to separate yourself, to cut yourself from the collective is nonsensical, now this time those who are going to India I have to tell you one thing, that you must get mixed up with people, we’ll not have any camp which will have only English or this, and is a very common failing, we must face it, it’s a very common failing because now I’m in England so I’m also English, but I don’t have this failing in me, but I have seen Indians when they live here they become like this, I went to a place called Marville Platte in Argentina it’s a very beautiful place, very beautiful colony of people, so I said who are these people living here?
They said all Spanish, Italians, this, that and English, they said no
English have a separate colony than this, I wouldn’t be surprised tomorrow we have a separate colony of the English Indians, could be, they say in Sanskrit, Sangase, Sangadosha means if you live with somebody become like that, so we might have some dukes and duchesses in the Indian community also possibly tomorrow if they live here, you see quite possible, this is such a atmosphere charged, we are something special and it shows so clearly when they do to another country, it creates problems, they cannot mix up with people, they cannot talk to others all the time they think they are like some media people, trying to criticise, the whole attitude is that we have to get mixed up with the whole ocean of Sahaja Yogis, instead of that if you behave like that people think they are sort of criticising us, that’s why I have said many a times that we cannot us the word I like or I believe, no not to use because that is how you despise others I don’t like this I don’t like that, you may not even have half of this in the house your own, but they will say like that, you may not have food in the house to eat but when they go to somebody house they will say I don’t like this food, that we don’t have to have, all these things I have seen in him and that’s what I am telling you, of course there are many books to read and we can, one good quality about English is that they are scholarly, they have scholarship, they read a lot, they know a lot, ordinary person will also know, also it being a very small country they know about little, little places, you go anywhere they know this glass is from Darlington, this is from here, that is from there, Indians wouldn’t know anything, if you ask them for, this sari comes from where, men, especially, women generally, men will say I don’t know, must be from India is it, or is it from Kenya, they know about birds about from where they come, but all these things you see this knowledge sometimes can make us over nationalistic, we the British, can come, be careful on that point, to say we are the British, we are not, we are not Indians, we are not British, we are nothing we are Gnostics, we are the ones who know, we are Yogis, because this is such an artificial ego in our head and that has made people hate us, while we are here to love the whole world, so our beauty lies in how much we love others, we must face ourselves see, how much do we love, others, how much do we care for others, how much do we enjoy others, how do I feel when I face another Sahaja Yogi, when I see you a ripple of joy becomes like a thunder to me, I mean I don’t know where I stand, sometimes I feel I might just raise myself of in the heaven, that is the content within us of our spirit not all this artificial things, they can never give us joy, they cannot give joy to anybody, we have to be very simple people, simple doesn’t mean that ah, you should just wear some little few
clothes, it doesn’t mean that, simple means from your heart, for small, small things you should feel happy, simple things should make you happy
and that is how we will get closer to each other, because this world
has to be one, now when it will be one year on, what’s going happen to the English I don’t know, I’ll have to jump in the sea I think because the way they will be encroached by all these people because they, they
are in a way, in an English way they are aggressive people because if
an Italian is there he’ll just walk into your house and say what have you got for today’s dinner see, quite possible and you will say what’s this, its very unmannerly to walk in my house, why do you have a house, even a rat cannot walk into that house, you polish your, brass, you do
all your cleanings, sweepings for whom, there’s not even a rat in the house to come and see it, whats the use of doing all this? Live like pigs than better is that not to waste energy because there’s not every a pig to come in see you, alright the climate is such we can’t leave the doors open, alright but hearts can be open, I have had lots of experiences of this myself, but in Sahaja Yoga if it crawls up, then I
don’t think how Sahaja Yoga can prosper, or people can have that content, the quality of Sahaja Yoga should be within us, how many
people we give realisation, how many people we can talk to, how much do
we know about Sahaja Yoga, how much we have mastered it, how many
people we get into Sahaja Yoga, can we? Its the circulation of the heart that is important and if you cannot circulate why are you living
on the heart, this is the country of heart, where Shiva lives where he is pulsating in everything, is pulsating in everything and there where you are there, then what you should do, circulation, how much you can circulate articulate with people, rapport, understanding everywhere there’s joy, everywhere there’s understanding, such oceans of depths people have, but we must know how to penetrate it, but if you want to have the pearls you have to dive down, but if you want to live with a
straw it is hanging there on the surface, live with it. We have come to Sahaja Yoga to become great people, we are British alright finished
now, done, but now we have a second birth we have entered into the Kingdom of God, now we are here to become great people, great monarchs and these styles and all this have come from the so called monarchs and
kings and horrible people they were do you know that, they told me that Queen Elizabeth the first one had a kind of a funny patch here, they
don’t know if she was a man of a woman of what ever it is, whatever she was a man of a woman, of a person, this was the thing she had a patch
here, that’s why she made this kind of a collar for her which was standing here and everybody had to wear that and they said about Victoria also said I don’t want to say anything against her because I
have great respect for her, but they say she developed a hump on the back so she developed this Victorian skirts, so also you can see that hippieism started in England, punkism started in England, where in the punks, they are mad, when I went to an exhibition in, ah, Rome, beautiful exhibition it was, we were passing from one country to another country and there I thought of England because I have become English as I have told you, he said where suitcase is there and there were about six seven boys mostly from Italy and three of four were laughing ha!ha!ha!, I said what’s happening there, what’s the matter
why are they laughing at the English when the English laugh at everyone, you know what was that, it was a punk shop, that’s the only thing they had for exhibition believe me holey pants, holey H-O-L-E-Y, holey pants and they had these, what you call them, what you call I
don’t know we call toora in Hindi language that kind of thing and all
that they were selling there and they said is all genuine, genuine, genuine from England and all of these Italians were laughing, so I
asked Ravia why are they laughing at these British, he said Mother we have a sense of ridicule, we have a great sense of ridicule, while these people think oh what, So what! what’s wrong if I cut my nose what’s wrong, so ultimately we end up into this kind of a stupidity as you know, that a person who has this kind of an ego becomes an idiot and there are many things that you can see clearly how, how we thought that we were something great and how people befouled us, there’s a
great writer in Hindi language called as Prenchad, I must tell you a
story is very interesting, we had English in India and we knew how to befool them I must tell you frankly and there were two Englishmen going
in Banares street and mostly in Banares they have their W.C.s on top in the open, you see they sit there and they had a, you know we carry our
jar, lota, a lota they call it lota with the water, somebody put the lota there and suddenly with some sort of a thing it fell down and it just fell down, are you recording me Hallo! now don’t record this, you don’t want to record it, only for English alright but don’t give it to anybody else, so the lota fell down and fell down he describes, fell on the feet of those where many Indians go and put there heads I said what that must be, they were the feet of two Englishmen and then the Englishmen got angry because you see according to their countries law nothing can be hurt, so they took the lota they said we are taking you to the police now, this has hurt us so much, so you see the man was upstairs, you see he came running, sorry, sorry, he said nothing doing we are going to take you to the police, it has hurt us you had no
business to keep a lota there that it fell on our feet, in India. Nobody compensates, but if an Englishman they’ll say it’s alright Babba it’s alright, what to do, so there was one fellow who thought of a trick, so he knew English he said see, you can take them to the police at most police will fine them a little bit but do you know this lota, he said what this lota belonged to Akbar, Akbar used to carry this lota with him, so instead of taking them if you ask for this lota will be a good idea its an antique piece you see, will be good for you Akbar the great, you see used to take this and he told him in Hindi language to them that I have befouled them and I have told then this belonged to Akbar and you just say that we don’t want to give this lota and you can take us to police, so they said now alright then if you give us this lota them we will forgive you, so these people said no we don’t want to give this lota, why because it belonged to Akbar, how can we give such a lota? You see was our forefather, we can’t give our lota to you, so then the English said alright are you willing to come to police, yes we are willing to come to police but we can’t give you this lota, so they
paid lot of money for the lota and bought it, and they were very proud you see and they took that lota see and they must have put it in some frame you see to say this was the lota was carried by Akbar, so this is how it is, so first we must have respect for other cultures, other things and other people and other countries and try to see what they have good about them, otherwise nothing will penetrate into you and you will be left high and dry all your life, there’s so many nice things in this world, say you go to Italy see the beautiful work they do the furniture they make, things they make, once they come to England I
don’t know what’s going to happen to us, we had lots of beautiful art and we had talents but all finished now nobodies having that and when they come here what is going to happen, in machinery when the Germans come here, they’ll finish us off, so we have to realise that this outside things and thinking that we are something great, is not greatness is within yourself, within your heart and it is so much, so much evident, so much evident here, that it’s really shocking, as a
reaction to all that formalities and all that people might have taken to say very casual dresses, alright, but that’s not the way because from inside it has to go, all these ideas have to be washed off completely, cleaned off, we have to know that we are the ones, we have to give light of the spirit to the whole world, how can we cover and
cloud ourselves with all these funny ideas and thats why it’s so many, you have asked me questions about Gavin only thing I have to say that to this extent only an Englishman can go because he can forgive himself, to this extent nobody else can go, nobody has done like this, no one has done like this we had so many people removed from Sahaja Yoga, you know that very well, but the way he has gone down and the way
he was with us for the last fourteen years it’s surprising and I understand that people ask me questions I understand why it is happening, but be careful, let us not be lost with these foolish stupid ideas we had and let us be something great, let us be within ourselves, see for ourselves, no amount of arrogance, no amount of artificiality is going to give us any special personality except that we realise what we are and what we know what we are, we enjoy ourselves we never get bored, we enjoy ourselves, never get bored, so at the beginning of the programme I have to say that I have seen the Sahaja Yogis if they want to be good they can be really very good people, in England, because the quality of intelligence is much better perhaps, also their scholarship is very good, but when they fall they fall also very fast and go down very much, so on what we have to depend is to our step where we are standing and what step we are going to take further, for example meditating, Dr. Brian Wells told me that don’t want to meditate in the ashram, now meditation is very important is the only way we can grow, now alright people used to get about about ten o’clock before, but do you don’t get drunk, why should you get up at ten o’clock? You have to get up in the morning you have to look after yourself, means you have to look after your spirit and that’s what we have to achieve and I know if you all decide you can do it very well among yourselves is better understanding but when it comes to others it seems there’s some sort of a communication gap, which should not be, if the Germans could be that gentle and so sweet you see in the German people who are Sahaja Yogis even to touch a flower is easier than to touch a German I tell you they have become so gentle, because they have learnt a lesson and I ask a German what’s the matter with English, why haven’t they learnt a lesson, he answered me back which is a very important thing to know, they have never lost a war Mother, they have to lose one war, they’ll be alright. So the gentleness which is not outward, which is not just a lip service, is from within, how can they hurt someone? I mean I have to put myself into a frame of mind to talk to you like this and I didn’t know how many flowers I should weave round my words so that it should not hurt you and even then you see the back of my mind there’s a kind of a sadness because I love you so much and it shows that I have stayed with you the most of the time, you are specially privileged, but that should give you greater humility because whatever are my qualities they should be much more in you and be shown to people that they say oh English we can make out like Mother to look at, they are like Mother to behave, they are just like Mother, let me hear that, Right so it’s a promise to me, is it alright on an Ashtami day let us finish all this negativity and let us become that special type of people who are worshiped all over alright.

May God Bless You.
