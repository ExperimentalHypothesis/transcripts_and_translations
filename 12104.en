I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know the truth is what it is. We cannot cheat it and we cannot conceptualize it. Also unfortunately at this human awareness we cannot know it. There is something more that has to happen to our awareness. Whatever I am telling you today you need not accept it blindfoldedly But you should keep your minds open like scientist. Treat it as a hypothesis and if proved you have to accept it as truth. Because it is for your benevolence and for the benevolence of your country and also for the benevolence of the whole world. The truth is that you are not this body, ind, your conditionings, your ego. But you are pure spirit. Yo say my mind, my body, my ego, so who is this my ?who runs your heart. The doctors say its autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto. We never think take, notice about it. You see all the beautiful flowers, they are the miracles. But we don't think about it. In the same way we have to become ?? Is miracle. As you see in this world there are so many problems. Physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and worst is moral. These problems are mostly caused by human beings. And all human problems come to earth from our subtle centres about which we have shown. If this centres could be put right all these problems can be solved. This power is within you , your own. And this power only gives you your second birth . That is the last break through of your evolution. All the religions have talked about enlightenment, about your second birth. But today the religions have become money oriented or power oriented. They are not spirit oriented. They are going in the opposite direction. And thats how we see the problems of fundamentalism. You have seen Bosnia where muslims, are human being after all they are human beings, are attacked. After all they are human beings and no body has business to kill like this. This is even worst than hitler. But who is doing it, christians are doing it. Christians who follow Christ. This is really anti christ activity. Where ?? muslim, christian or any thing nobody has right to kill them. Its not only one country but whole world seems to be mad now. They have forgotten their religions, forgotten what is written in their books and doing everything absolutely against the religions. So we don't understand where to go. Science is a-moral. It has no morality behind it. And science has its limitations. It cannot tell you what is your identity, why have you come on this earth. So we have to turn inward for our enlightenment. Sahaja, saha is with, ja is born with you; is right you have union with all pervading power. So second truth is that all this miracles , this flowers is all the by that all pervading power by that divine love. You have not felt it but many have felt. And once you are united with this then your life is transformed. For eg. this instrument if is not connected to the main has no meaning. In the same way unless and until you are connected to the mains you have no meaning. There is no identity. You don't know why you are on this earth. While this power which is in your triangular bone named as sacrum, rises passes through six centres it nourishes all the centres solving your physical, mental and emotional problems. And ultimately it comes out of your fontanelle bone area and gets connected to this all pervading power which is very subtle. Firstly you start feeling the cool breeze as the cool vibrations as this divine power. now when this power you start feeling in finger tips, you are amazed that your finger tips are enlightened. You can feel on your finger tips whats wrong with your own chakra your own centre. Also you can feel the centres of others. So who is the other. You become from microcosm a macrocosm. Like one drop of ocean becomes the ocean. When the kundalini crosses this point agya, then she makes you thoughtlessly aware. Thoughts come to us from the past and the future. But we cannot be in the present. In between past and future there is not thought. When the kundalini raises then she elongates those thoughts and there is a space in between which makes us absolutely silent. We become peaceful. That is source of our peace. People talk about peace, the association of peace, they get award of peace; but they have no peace with themselves. I met many of them. They have no peace within themselves. So this state that is within you which is called thoughtless awareness. So by feeling the vibrations of others you become collectively conscious. So a new dimension develops within nerves after selfrealisation. Now you get a power and you can raise the kundalini of others and can give realisaton to others and cure others. So many things that happen, because you become so dynamic and compassionate. You have all this powers potentially within you. But you have to manifest them. If you manifest them then you become super conscious human being. This is the time of last judgement. The stupid idea of all dead bodies will become human beings is absolutely illogical. But many souls are taking births in this modern times. And that is why we have population problem. They are taking birth for their last judgment. But this is the time I call as blossom time. Because many are born as beautiful flowers becomes the fruit. In Quran they call it qiyama where resurrection will take place. So its clearly said that when resurrection will take place your hands will speak and will tell a?? you. But the stupid idea is that we should all die and bodies will come back making them fundamentalists. So also a ?? a craze is there that we must suffer. Why should you suffer. God almighty who has created you is your father and is full of love for you all [not audible]. Why will he make you suffer. Christ has already suffered for us. Are you going to suffer for Christ's sake ? So now the time has come for all of you to get your self realisation. So that you become the spirit. Spirit is the universal being within you. So you get universal personality. It is the source of absolute knowledge. So everybody who get the enlightenment thinks (??) the same thing. Outside they may be different but inside they are all just the same. So there are no arguments, there are no fights, there are no wars and ?? is the source of joy. Joy is not duality, ?? happiness and unhappiness. Its an absolute state of enjoyment. In India there are three doctors who got their MD in sahaja yoga. And many doctors in many country who are trying to record how many people being cured by sahaja yoga. You yourself can cure yourself. Also there are many people who are mentally cured. I don't say don't do this don't do that, but people in the light of spirit could not do wrong things. They are innately righteous. Also ?? I am born in a christian family I call myself christian. Christ has said though shall not have adulterous eyes. But how many you find people who are that pure in their eyes. But after this happening eyes become pure and innocent and attention becomes enlightened. Wherever you put your attention, you purify. It is all your own and you can get in no time. Of course it is not meant for idiotic people. Also it is not meant for arrogant people. You have to humble down in your heart. Its a living process of evolution for which you don't have to pay at all. God does not understand money. It does not understand maths. You cannot bribe him. He understand you desire your desire to become spirit for which you don't have to labour, you don't have to go to Himalayas and to stand on your heads. But If you have no value for your life then it wouldn't work out. So it will take hardly ten minutes. But I respect your freedom and if you don't want to have your realisation please leave the hall. Because it cannot be forced. And you should not disturb others. Those who want realisation will have it. Only thing those who are wearing shoes should take out their shoes because this mother earth absorbs helps us ?? .

As you are told we have two powers left and right. Left power is the power of desire, and the right is the power of action. Please those who are sitting on the chair should put both feet apart from each other. But those who are sitting on the ground are alright. In short I will tell you that there are three conditions which you have to understand and accept it. The first one is that you have to be fully confident that you will get your selfrealisation tonight. The second condition is that you are not to feel guilty any more. If you feel guilty then the centre on the left side here catches. It goes into jeopardy and you get diseases like angina, spondylitis and also lethargic organs. So what is the use of any guilt. If you have done mistakes, just face it and finish it. Those ?? tell you are sinners, there is nothing like that. This may be money making proposition. That means you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Now the third thing is that you have to forgive everyone. But whether we forgive or don't forgive, we don't do anything. But if you do not forgive then you play in the wrong hands and torture yourself. Also this centre agya gets closed like this. But if you forgive it opens and the kundalini passes through. So please forgive everyone without thinking about it. Don't think about individuals because that will give you headache. Just in general you have to say I forgive everyone. These are three conditions. I request everyone to be seated and put the feet away from each other. Now we will show you how you are going to nourish your own centres that ?? for today. First thing please put the left hand towards me like this which is symbolic in suggesting that you want your selfrealisation. Now put your right hand, because right hand is for action. Put it on your heart. Here in the heart is the spirit. Everybody should do it please. If you don't want to do it you can go out. I have already told you in the beginning otherwise you can go. So please your right hand on your heart. This is the centre where resides your spirit. If you become the spirit you become your own guide your own master. Now take your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side and press it. We are working only on the left side. Here is the centre of the mastery. This centre was created by great masters and prophets. We have to just enlighten. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of your divine knowledge. Your hands should be like this on your lap. This is the centre pure divine knowledge. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. And raise it in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head toward right. I had told you that this centre if it is in trouble you get many diseases. So you should not feel guilty. Now take right hand on top of your forehead across and bend your head. This is the centre where you forgive everyone in general. Now please put your right hand on the back side of your head and pushback your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power for your satisfaction. Now stretch your palm fully. This is the last centre. Put you centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now stretch back your fingers is very important ?? pressure. Now put down your head and move your scalp with pressure seven times clock wise slowly. Please put down your heads put down your heads. Seven times. Thats all you have to do. We have close our eyes , you can take away your spectacles and dont ope your eyes till I tell you. So now please see that your two feet are apart from each other and your left hand like this (is placed) on your left lap. Now dont try to control your thoughts or nothing. Just leave it alone. Now put your right hand on your heart and close your eyes. Please don't open them till I tell you. Here now resides the spirit. So you have to ask me a very fundamental question three times you can call me mother or you can call me Shri Mataji; “Mother am I the spirit” ask this three times. I told you that when you become the spirit you become your own master. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and ask another fundamental question about yourself. Please ask three times “Mother am I my own master”. Now I cannot force pure divine knowledge on you. I respect your freedom.

So please take your right hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. You have to ask for pure divine knowledge six times because this centre has got six petals. So please say six times “Mother please give me pure divine knowledge”. As soon as you ask the divine knowledge the kundalini power starts rising. And you have to open your centres nourishing them with your self confidence. So raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you can say ten times with full confidence “Mother I am my own master”. I have already told you that your are not this body, this mind, this ego or conditioning but you are pure spirit. o raise your right hand on top of your heart and here you have to say twelve times with full confidence “Mother I am pure spirit”. This divine power is the source of ??. it is the ocean of compassion, bliss and joy. So whatever mistakes you may commit it can be easily dissolved because it is the ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself. Now put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head towards right. Here you can say sixteen times with full confidence “Mother I am not guilty at all”. I have already tole you whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive you play into wrong hands. You have already tortured yourself for you life and now if you don't forgive you will also miss your self realisation because your agya centre wouldn't open. So now please raise your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head. Here you can say without thinking about others “Mother I forgive everyone in general”. Say it from your heart, not how many times. Now, please take back your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes you have to say for your satisfaction “O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me”. You have to say it from your heart, not how many times. Now please open your palm fully, stretch it, and put the centre of the palm on the top of the fontanelle bone area which is the soft bone in the childhood. Now press it hard and put down your head, it is important to push back your finger so that feel pressure on your scalp. Moreover I cannot force self realisation on you. You have to ask for it. So please say seven times “Mother please give me self realisation” and move your scalp slowly clockwise seven times saying that. Please put down your heads. Push back your fingers, push back. Now please take down your hands. Open your eyes and put both the hands towards me. Watch me and don't think. ?? . This is not ??. now please put your right hand towards me like this, bend your head and see with the left hand if a cool or hot breeze is coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Again bend your head, don't put your hand on top of your head, away from it. Some people get it very far. Now please put the left hand towards me, bend your head, with the right hand see if the cool or hot breeze is coming out of your fontanelle bone area. If you have not forgiven everyone you will feel hot breeze. So please forgive now. Now put your right hand towards me and with your left hand on top of your fontanelle area and see for yourself if there's a cool or hot breeze is coming. Now, please put down your head, please put down your head. Now raise both your hand towards the sky like this, push back your head. Here you have to ask anyone of these three questions ?? please ask “Mother is this the cool breeze of the holy ghost “ or “Mother is this the all pervading divine power of love” or “Mother is this the paramachaitanya”. Any one of these questions you ask, three times. Now please take down your hands. Put your hands like this. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze is out of their fontanelle (bone area) or on your finger tips or on the hands, please raise both your hands. Everyone of you have felt for the first time this all pervading power. But, please remember that this is the beginning of your growth. Of course you have to come to the collective because this is not a individual growth. If one finger is hurt the whole body feels it. But if a leg is take out it doesn't grow. So you have to respect your self realisation and you have to come to the collective, our followers and become one with all of them. Sahaja yoga is working in 55 nations. Apart from India, Russia has thousands of sahaja yogis. But you have grow and you don't have to pay at all for it . I know next year when I come you will be grown as great trees of sahaja yoga. Also it has to spread, it has to spread. We have say from other country thousands of yogis. Also Bulgaria, ?? . May God bless you !. Now enjoy yourself.

And they will let me know. She is the leader here now. She has come from Switzerland. She is very old sahaja yogini. They want to sing a song to you.
