Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 5 September 1998.

I think I have told you a lot about him and his nature, but still so many of us have not yet realised what are his powers and what he wants. First and foremost thing is that to respect Shri Ganesha is to understand the importance of chastity. Chastity is not only for the women, it is more for the men to observe. If you have self respect, in the real sense of the word, you will take to chastity without any difficulties. But if you have no self respect, then you run after something which is very low, of a very degrading quality. So it is very important that chastity must be respected, must be understood, and must be imbibed. This habit of not observing the proper protocol of the chastity develops from childhood and we have to be very careful when we are in a Ganesha state, we should not take to such horrible things. I don’t know from where people get the ideas. 

As you see today in the whole world there is a crisis of chastity.  In the West, especially, we have heard of so many cases of child abuse. In a temple of God one should not even take the name of this dirty disease which has grabbed the people. But in India we have never heard of it. We don’t know it. Of course some of the men are very very ruined people and they can’t help it unless and until they are put into jail. But for a Sahaja Yogi it is very important to look after our chastity. As I told you yesterday, it is not necessary to find a girl for yourself, or a boy for yourself. It is also against the rules of chastity. I am not saying that you should allow your parents to decide, but let the Sahaja Yoga decide, because you are Sahaja Yogis. You are born after the image of Ganesha who ultimately becomes Christ. So what should be your attitude towards chastity is very important. The most important thing that  if we get ruined on our chastity level then Sahaja Yoga is very very difficult and it doesn’t give you that blessing as you should have. 

You saw people yesterday from Romania and also from Ukraine. They were singing so beautifully. One of the reasons is that basically they are very very humble people. They have humbled down. So much so that they have given up nonsensical ideas about sex life. So the humility will teach you that you are not having your self respect. 

In Islam they stressed a very big importance on chastity - very concerned. And this has gone to such an extent that Mohammed Sahib said, that you can have 5 wives or 4 wives, but you don’t have women who are prostitutes. Once this chastity starts leaving us we don’t mind - anything under the sun. We have seen this also ........working out in many people who are quite highly placed. And these highly placed people think that they are something great, and that they can overcome the binding of Jesus Christ and they can do what they like, go on misbehaving with women who are under them. They may do it secretly, they may do it anywhere, but Ganesha watches them, and he punishes them for what they are doing. It is a terrible thing to go into these kind of ventures which are not the field of Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja yogis have to first of all steady their eyes, because it is concerned with the power of Jesus Christ. But in all the Christian nations I have seen, people have wandering eyes. Very surprising. When Christ is their leader, they worship Christ, go to church, sing the praise of Christ, and they have wandering eyes, all over. These wandering eyes cannot be representative of the chastity of Christ.

Now the second point is that the power of Ganesha can only be manifested if you are wise. Because he is the giver of wisdom. Now people don’t understand what this wisdom is, it’s a big problem. Intelligence, so called, is not wisdom. It can give you a very cunning, very aggressive, and sometimes very subtle person, who can go on deceiving people, telling lies, doing all kinds of things, and believing in themselves that they are very successful. Success is never the criteria of a Sahaja Yogi. Success in Sahaja Yoga means very subtle surrendering of oneself to Sahaja Yoga. That is seldom to be found unless and until you meditate every day. It’s very important that you must meditate. Those who do not meditate will be lost to Sahaja Yoga. Because wisdom can only grow through your inner inspiration. You can have this inner inspiration only if the power of Shri Ganesha manifests. He is the giver of your wisdom. In the wisdom what you do is to find solutions. Solutions which are peaceful, which are satisfying which are true. He is the one who sets you to task also. Like yesterday, I was told there was a whirlwind and many people had to suffer a little bit because of the wind that came and blew off your tents. There is no need to have tents in this climate, what is the need? I don’t understand. But they cannot live without a tent. I can sleep outside very nicely, on the street also. So there is no need to sort of fuss about all these things and bring the whole household here. There is no need. 

We should not be afraid of discomfort. If you want to have a very comfortable life, and you can’t suffer any discomfort - you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. In olden days people used to go to Himalayas, stand on one leg, do whatever, and they didn’t give realisation - they couldn’t get realization. While you all have got realization.  So one should not try to make oneself a very very sort of lordly person. There is no need to care for comfort. I can live with comfort and I can live anywhere, at this age also. 

So what you have to do is not to practice, I should say, asceticism but to become an acetic. Practicing means trouble. But if you just become an acetic from within then you don’t bother about these little little things here and there. But our style is still molded by the outside world. If we haven’t got our own world then we are going as the fashion is. And once you start going with the fashion then the wisdom disappears. I never tell anybody that you don’t have this fashion or that fashion or anything. It’s your wisdom which will teach you.  Wisdom will teach you how to regulate yourself, because you have come here to ascend, to achieve a very special place in the realm of spirituality.

I must stress again on the power of wisdom. Before doing anything you should just appeal to your wisdom and find out if it is wise to be like that. With this reference you will reduce your temper. Absolutely. You will reduce your lust, you will reduce your guilt very much. Because once you start understanding that there is no wisdom in feeling guilty, your guilt will disappear. 

Also the worst thing is that we have a great desire to have this and to have that, and to indulge into all kinds of greed. This greed becomes zero as soon as you understand wisely that there is no need. Otherwise all the time you will be thinking about yourself, about your health, about your children, about your house, whatever is supposed to be yours. But death proves that nothing belongs to you. You have come alone and you will have to go alone. This is the wisdom which is to be imbibed. You cannot practise it. You cannot force it, but it’s to be imbibed through your spirituality. Then the greatest thing that happens is the joy. Joy of the dancing of Shri Ganesha. Like a child, if you see him dancing, how joyous he feels and you also feel. In that same way a little child is born within you and you start behaving like a small child. Normally it has no sense of lust, greed, nothing. It knows how to share. 

So this is the position, we say, that you become a Gana. The army of Shri Ganesha. They are Ganas. They are very powerful and they do all the work of the world. They live in this world, but all their source of energy is from the divine. So Shri Ganesha is an Omkara. He is the first created deity by the Goddess, because he is auspiciousness. So first auspiciousness is created for our good. We are auspicious because of Shri Ganesha. Some people, if they are in the house, they create problems. They are always creating problems, out of nothing. They are not auspicious people. Those who are peacemakers, those who are loving are the ones who are blessed by Shri Ganesha. What is the wisdom in fighting? You should find out what is the wisdom in fighting? Why are you fighting? For what things? For small small things. Things that you can yourself correct. Why should you fight? If you have a fighting nature that means that Ganesha is against you. Ganesha is not with you. That power is not with you. There is no wisdom in it. 

In this world all those great people who have been respected since centuries have been very very wise people. Not hot tempered, not people who were quarreling, not people who were having lust as the aim of their life. Such people will never be remembered by their progeny. But that’s not so important as you, as Sahaja Yogis, are very important. You are here on this earth to emancipate the whole of humanity. So what should be the aim of your life is to go deep into your spirituality. This aim of getting into spirituality - I think you all know, you see it, but you do not work out. I have told you last time that your attention has to be inside, not outside, and you should not react. All these procedures help you to be wise, to be sensible. But this sensible person who is just sensible as far as his own comforts are concerned, money is concerned, or his own health is concerned, everything encompassing him, is not a wise person. He is not wise. If you see a little child (who is properly brought up of course) he will always bother about other people. He’ll find out what others need, what can make them happy. With all the simple methods he will try to please others, but not to gain any favour, or to show off that he is very generous, but in the real sense of the word, that gives him joy. That is the collective.

Today I am going to tell you something more about this collective nature that comes to you through Shri Ganesha´s efforts, or you can say, his powers. Somebody told me that Einstein had already made a story like that with the discovery that, if you all become cool, that is under the Shri Ganesha´s blessing - then we all become one. That’s his theory. But we also have Phil Ward here who established that when you cool down the helium gas all the molecules, or you can call them atoms, they start moving in a collective way. Otherwise they are hitting each other, and they are running against each other. In the same way when we have Shri Ganesha’s blessing within us, in the real sense of the word, with our wisdom, then what happens is we become very much evolved Sahaja Yogis. Evolved Sahaja Yogis means they have become one. One means what? One means they all live for each other. They enjoy each other. They see to the comfort of each other. For example the people who are very rich, the people who are very poor, people who are sick, people who are healthy, all of them combine together as one. In Sanskrit it is called Ekakharika. They become one and this oneness shows in your celebrations. When you all come here you try to help each other all the time. I have seen it - nobody minds helping each other. I have seen people enjoying each other. They do not want to hurt anyone. On the contrary they want to be helpful and sensible with each other. Most of your leaders, I have chosen, who are very wise, who avoid problems, who do not get into violence, most of them, I should say. And when, you see even you people try to destroy Sahaja Yoga, they know you are doing it. So to find out this Ekakharika, you have to go deep down into yourself, by which you will feel that you are now one, whether you are here or you are in Japan, or you are in America, anywhere! You all think the same way, you all help the same cause, and you try to be the same style. I have seen people when they come for the pujas. So many of them. How they enjoy each others company. How they try to help each other. 

Somebody who is say in Russia, or say in Bulgaria, anywhere, he will write to me about the problem he has. So somebody from America, without my telling, without my informing them, without any information, immediately writes to me “Mother, such and such a person is there in Russia, will you be able to send that person to America?” Most of the time it happens like that. I don’t tell them. I never ask them. Even if I ask, suddenly there will be a response from so many people from so many countries. “Mother it’s the problem, alright, we’ll go and do it”. For that I must say Austrians are very sensible people, in this respect. They went all the way to Jerusalem to help the people, to get them realised. I wanted to go to Jerusalem but this bombing business may not allow me to go. But the Jerusalem people, I found them to be much more collective, because they came to Egypt. I said “Now why have you come here?” “To make friends with the Moslems of Egypt” Just imagine. I was surprised. How could they come here? No, just to make friends. They are Moslems so we want to make friendship. So making friendship without any ulterior motive, without any gain, is one of the signs of your Ekakharika. Not only that you are satisfied with other Sahaja Yogis, but you want to bring other Sahaja Yogis in. So many have done that. This is something so nourishing. 

Now as you have been enlightened you get another person who is enlightened. It’s very great joy giving. If you give realisation to one person you feel very happy. I mean so many write to me “Mother now we have got 20 persons or 30 persons” and they are very happy that we have got so many Sahaja Yogis. By doing that, one should not develop the ego. Then again, you go against Shri Ganesha. Because Christ, you know, he doesn’t like it. Egotistical people, he doesn’t like, and he is Shri Ganesha. So he doesn’t like such people, who, out of their ego, want to create an organisation of their own, and try to dominate others. This kind of people they don’t like. Both of them are the same (Ganesha, Christ) there is complete Ekakharika between them. In the same way we too develop that special quality of Ekakharika. We forget about so called religions that we have. 

See now how they are fighting. All the leaders which are outside are fighting among themselves. They are dishonest, they are doing all kinds of wrong things. You know it very well! Everyday it is in the newspapers that you hear about what wrongs they are doing. They are a little bit successful but not for a long time. Because they will be exposed. This is the time of exposure that they will loose that great filth on which they have been working out. All these will have to just disappear. These false ideas about superiority of any religion. How can a religion be superior to another one which is created by the effort of Shri Ganesha´s auspiciousness? It is not auspicious at all that you fight another religion or you fight another creed or you say that this is a lesser race, or we are a higher race. All these false ideas, they drop out. This doesn’t remain anymore. Because all these ideas have created problems.

Say in America, they first hated the blacks, now the blacks are hating the whites. It’s a big turmoil going on. Then we have, also in India we had people who were supposed to be untouchables. They were tortured, they were troubled and they did a lot of wrong things  which they should never have done. It’s not written in the Shastras. Because of that, now they are acting against the so called “touchables” and putting them right in their own places. So this brings in conflict. Shri Ganesha is the one who gives you the wisdom to understand that nobody is superior to another person. You are all made by God and whatever is made by God is auspicious and beautiful. Once you start understanding that, this Ekakharika spreads outside us. It spreads to other people. It’s not just because of a certain social understanding, and a social upliftment you try to be good to others, no. It is from inside, inside you feel it. 

This Ekakharika first must work in the family. It is very important. The family which is disturbed all the time cannot create children who are in the state of Ekakharika. That’s why  always tell them that - don’t fight. In the family if they are fighting they cannot be Sahaja Yogis. If there is such a fight it is better to get out of such a family. So we have sanctioned also a divorce. Any man who is flirting with other women or doing wrong things, we have asked him to get out of Sahaja Yoga. The reason is, one bad apple can spoil many apples. So such a man or such a woman should be kept out of Sahaja Yoga completely, so that there is a better family relationship, which is very important in Sahaja Yoga. Your family relationships should be absolutely perfect. I can’t understand. You can’t enjoy the company of your wife, then what are you going to enjoy in this world? If you cannot enjoy the bliss of your family life, you cannot enjoy anything else. This very close relationship of husband and wife is thrown apart because of Ganesha problem only. If the Ganesha was alright there would have been a perfect union, perfect understanding between husband and wife. But if that fails that means that there is something definitely wrong with the Shri Ganesha. Try to correct your own Shri Ganesha than see to others. You have to meditate, and meditate on Shri Ganesha. You sit on the ground and meditate.

Now when we run away from the Mother Earth and we don’t touch her, we don’t respect her, in a way we don’t respect Shri Ganesha. He was made out of the Mother Earth, and he controls the Mother Earth. He controls all the 5 elements. Not only that, but he controls you. 

I liked the film yesterday where they showed a Ganesha walking about with another person, who was telling, don’t do this and don’t do that. It was a very very beautiful film because it suggests that Ganesha is always there to tell you not to do it. But if you do it then you develop all kinds of horrible diseases, all kinds of horrible faces, all kinds of family problems, also you can develop national problems. So this is so important to understand, that such a feeling of, I should say, very inauspicious character has to be avoided. I can’t understand, how can people feel so bad about small small children, some 2 year old child, some 5 year old. If you see a child, or even a photograph of a child, you feel like loving them, you feel like kissing that child. If the children cannot be respected, how can you understand the value of Shri Ganesha? See how sweet they are, how sweetly they behave, and they understand. They understand you, they understand me. I know even the small children, they are very small, even new born children, they understand me.  So it is innately within them, it is built in, the kind of feeling of understanding the love. 

To understand the love is also very difficult for egotistical people, because they love themselves, they don’t love anybody else. Or if they love somebody it is out of lust or maybe greed, there will be some sort of association. But love for love’s sake is only possible if your Shri Ganesha is properly cleaned out and kept. We have come so far, and we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over the world. Of course I have worked very hard, I must say, but you people have supported me very much. I am thankful to you. It is not possible, in the Western world especially, where there is no consideration of Ganesha’s principle, that you people should come out so well and accept Sahaja Yoga as a life for yourself.

In Sahaja Yoga the most important thing is to worship Shri Ganesha within you and the quality of Shri Ganesha within you. It is very soothing, it is very peace giving, it is very secure, a security creating power. If your Ganesha is alright nobody can touch you. Nobody can destroy you. Nobody can upset you. Because he is the one who is the giver of peace. The world peace is disturbed because we have not worshipped Shri Ganesha. I have seen people in very big positions, in charge of military, in charge of this and that, but not in charge of themselves. Their Ganesha is absolutely ruined and finished. All such people are such leaders of nations and people try to follow them in their own way. Though they may do something secretly....doesn’t matter.....people know about it. Because inauspicious, if you are using, then the whole world comes to know. Somehow. It will all be exposed, because Satya Yuga has come. In this new Yuga there’s light of the truth within us, and this truth can expose all that is nonsensical we have been into. 

Now truth is the quality of Shri Ganesha. He is the one who is giving us truth. In our brain it comes to us through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ has worked so much, he has done so much, but look at the condition  of the people who are supposed to be following him. Look at the way they are behaving. They could at least show that if you are following Ganesha and Jesus Christ you are in the image of that personality which is something so very spiritual. Spiritual life is the giver of joy. You cannot get joy out of anything else but spirituality. You can get some satisfaction, you can get some ego, you might feel that you are something great, but the only way you can get the inner peace and joy is Shri Ganesha´s manifestation in the chakras. He manifests in all the chakras, which when you are in a proper state on those chakras, you get the joy, and that joy comes to you through Shri Ganesha. 

These days people are writing horrible books, horrible things. Also there are some who are trying to write very sweet things about Shri Ganesha´s principle of understanding, principle of his auspiciousness. Very sweetly, I have seen some people have written some very sweet stories about him. It’s not only the love stories. Up to a point, alright, they have created so many love stories, love stories, love stories. Now something beyond that one has to know. And beyond that is this Ganesha principle, which is of complete peace, of complete joy, and of understanding of love. The value of pure love. Of giving and also of taking. Anyone who gives you the pure love should be understood in the right way. 

I, yesterday, knew that Shri Ganesha has gone off a little bit. I don’t know why he was like that. But one has to understand that there must be some people within us who do not follow the principle of Shri Ganesha, and that is why these troubles are there. So with a sincere heart, and a sincere mind , if you ask the blessings of Shri Ganesha he is always ready to give. But if you don’t listen to him, and if you destroy your chastity in any way, he will punish you. He’ll not spare you, he doesn’t have the idea of sparing. At the level of Christ, only, he thought of forgiving. Of forgiving you. But forgiving doesn’t mean that any sin can be forgiven. NO. It’s a kind of controlling power. Christ has said that you’ll be forgiven, but Shri Ganesha, at a point, when he sees people are forgiving, he tries to punish you. That’s the limiting point where he thinks it’s not proper to forgive such and such a person.  So for Christ, to forgive is alright, but for Shri Ganesha, he has to expose and punish the person. So in a way you have to know that Christ is very great, because he gives us the forgiving power; and Shri Ganesha is very powerful because he limits our forgiving. He may forgive anyone. He may say that “I would like to forgive” but we don’t know if Shri Ganesha will allow it to that extent. And Christ accepts that because they are the same. They are like the two sides of one coin. So we cannot depend too much on the forgiveness power of Christ because there is Ganesha who is sitting there and he has in his hands, you have seen, a very powerful weapon. He is the one who is just peace. Who is coolness. Who gives you coolness after realisation. You get the cool breeze because of Shri Ganesh. Because, it is Paramachaitanya, no doubt, but the one who emits it is Shri Ganesha. He cools you down. He brings you down to a very cool satisfied and a person who has complete calmness. With that calmness you become all one. This Ekakharika starts. Oneness is established. Whatever country you may be living in, whatever country you may be proud of, you will see the bad things in that country and you will try to improve that. You will not be identified with the bad things. This is the greatest thing of this Satya Yuga that it exposes, and you do not support something that is wrong, which is being done as an aggression - you don’t agree with. And once you don’t accept that, then you start becoming one with the people who are one with you. And they all believe in the same thing, their ideas are the same, their thinking is the same, their joy is the same, and they enjoy each other very much. They become one, and this oneness has to be established fully in Sahaja Yoga. 

Some people who are only interested in making money, who are interested in getting a good crowd or some sort of a thing of a very low level, cannot.(Become one.) Those who are in Sahaja Yoga to find wives for themselves or husbands for themselves, aren’t (one). This spirituality grows with humility.  The humility of Ganesha is told by this. Once when his mother asked him that the one who will go around the Earth 3 times I will give him a present. So Shri Ganesha thought “Who is greater than my Mother? Not this Earth”. He had a small little rat on which he used to travel. This shows that he was so humble - on a rat he could travel with no pressure on the rat, and while his brother Kartikeya had a peacock which could fly, so he knew he could not go around the world before his brother. So he just went round his Mother 3 times and he got the present. This shows, one thing, that speed is not the way of Sahaj. You have to slow down your speed. Apart from that you have to understand what is the most important thing, as he understood the most important thing is to love your Mother, to respect your Mother, and know that she is the highest, she is the greatest, and that is how he has been expressed within ourselves. Once that happens, your spirituality grows.

I hope you will work it out this way now, Shri Ganesha, and start the Ekakharika. I don’t like people writing letters against their leaders, against this man and that man. That is not good. There is no need. If you just can be forgiving and keeping one with each other. Try to get more people and more people. You cannot separate anyone and say that they are condemned because they are no good. Try to get them with your forgiveness, with your sense of chastity, you should forgive them.  So these extremities should also be given up, this perhaps comes from a kind of sense of insecurity. If they are not ...... people you drive them out. It is Shri Ganesha. So don’t get frightened of them, and don’t get upset with them. Try to be one and try to be more attractive people to yourself, keeping them to you. Try to manage them and look after them.

I hope you will all meditate now after this to develop your Ganesha qualities and to develop that power of chastity, and also of peace and security. 

May God bless you !!
