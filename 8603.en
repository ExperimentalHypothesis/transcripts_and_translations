Greetings to all seekers of truth!

Yesterday, I mentioned that within us lies a profound truth, and externally, there is another truth. The first truth is that we are souls, we are in the form of souls and the second truth is that this entire creation, this entire world, operates through a very subtle power. And this power, attaining this power, and to be one with it, is what yoga is all about. This one is the second truth, and we should accept both of these truths at this time. It is very easy to doubt, and through education, people tend to doubt even more. That is why Kabir said, Scholars have become fools through reading, because excessive reading increases their doubts and decreases their sensitivity. They want to understand the truth solely through intellectual reasoning and argument, but the truth is beyond intellect. Truth is beyond the intellect, and it will be realized through this living process. Now, if you are a scientist and want to examine a stricture base, you start with a hypothesis. If the hypothesis is correct, you should first understand it and keep an open mind, just like a scientist should. Then, see if it occurs and if it happens. If it does, you should accept it as valid. If you want to acknowledge it, you cannot do so until it is proven. However, once it is proven, it is essential that you use it with integrity because it is for your benefit and for the benefit of the entire world. Similarly, there is another question about when an incarnation (avatar) will occur in the Kali Yuga and what the time of this incarnation will be, etc. The point is, if an incarnation does appear, how will you recognize it? Have you recognized anyone up until now? So many incarnations have occurred in the world, but no one has ever recognized.

First, there should be preparation to recognize the incarnation when they come, otherwise, even in the Kali Yuga, the avatar will go unrecognized and their efforts will be in vain. Therefore, first and foremost, you need to be prepared, and you must attain self-realization. Only you have achieved self-realization will you be able to recognize who the incarnation is and who is not. Sahaja Yoga is meant for this recognition. First, attain your self-realization, and then you will naturally know what is true and what is false. Because when we cannot see something, it’s like holding a snake in your hand in the dark. If we tell you there is a snake, you might argue and say, No, this is a rope. But as soon as there is light, you will automatically let go of the snake. Similarly, with falsehood, once the light of truth comes, falsehood naturally falls away on its own. And the awakening of the Kundalini is an entirely natural process; it is not difficult at all. It becomes difficult because we overanalyze it. Just as you plant a seed in the earth, the mother earth naturally awakens it because the potential is inherent in the seed and the mother earth possesses this power. Because the mother earth has this power, and the seed also has this power, it happens naturally. This is the law of nature. You cannot explain how this occurrence by reasoning. Reading books, or standing on your head, will the seed sprout that way? Until you place the seed in the womb of the mother earth, it cannot sprout. Similarly, this is also a living process. Today, you have evolved from an amoeba to a human being. No one thinks about what power within us has facilitated this transformation. What is this subtle power within us that has enabled us to become human beings today? No one can think about it, and no one can do so.

Even in science, there are many questions that doctors, scientists cannot answer, but the answers can only be found in Sahaja Yoga. The reason is that Sahaja Yoga attains unity with that power from which everything in the world is made. You can understand what science knows, what is visible. For what is invisible, you have to delve into the invisible. In the entire world today, you see that in Western countries, there is prosperity like grown up tree and so on, which is not in fact. I already told you before that there is no prosperity there; the situation is very bad. We, at least, have our families, our children, our homes; our society is very good right now. But there, you will see that people neither have their parents nor their children, nor do they have any relatives; everything has turned into a money matter. People have become extremely distressed. And this tree that has taken a huge shape like a rock, its roots are in this country. I just told you yesterday that it is your responsibility to spread the power of these roots to the whole world. But if you don't want to spread this power everywhere, then the responsibility will fall on you for not accepting it.

Now, this is our heritage. Our heritage, written about Kundalini, has been described in our country since ancient times. It's not just written in our country; it has been written in many countries. Thou, thou that which exist are also this Kundalini. It is also described in many ways by posture Aasana etc.; it is described in many ways. It is also mentioned in the Bible that there is a tree of life within you, and it is because of this tree of life that you will be reborn. Everywhere it is said that in the world, things that are temporary, ephemeral, and perishable should be used with caution. But all scriptures, all religions, have the same essence: that you attain that eternal life. And everything else is futile. Attaining eternal life is the main and ultimate purpose, and there is no other purpose in it. Whatever we are doing, whatever we are remembering God's name, recollecting, running, going to temples or mosques, praying, all have one purpose: to attain that eternal life. And to attain that eternal life, we need self-realization.

This is inherent in Sahaja, so people wonder how it could be possible. But you know, Guru Nanak Sahib also said, Attain Sahaja Samadhi. All of this happens in Sahaja. If you understand, if it were unnatural, how difficult would it be? Consider that you are breathing; breathing is very important, an essential thing. If for that, you had to read books and scriptures, then how many people would remain alive? Similarly, this is also extremely necessary, which is called vital. For something that is absolutely essential, if you had to read books and open scriptures, then how many people would achieve enlightenment? This action was supposed to happen and will happen. Sage Bhrigu also wrote a significant book on this, named 'Nadi Granth'. If it becomes available, you people should read it; then you will have faith. The difficulty is that even though something proven is right in front of you, you still have to provided examples first. Someone wrote something in a book, it's written in that book, it's written like this, and then people understand. But let me ask you directly, if I say here that there's a diamond lying here, it's a valuable diamond, and you can obtain that diamond without paying a penny, what do you think? Will you just sit there? People will come running from all over the world; and same way if I say that there is a diamond in your heart, which you just need to polish, that will illuminate your own consciousness, then why would you doubt and hesitate? Then another question arises, that this statement is not written anywhere in the scriptures. Many things are not written in the scriptures, that's why we are here in front of you. If everything were already written, why would we stand here today? It would have been all said and done beforehand. It's not written that after the awakening of Kundalini, you feel awakening in your fingers, nor is it written that you know about the chakras in it. If everything written was the final word, and there was nothing more to be said afterward, then why did they say that after that there would be realization, there would be Qiyamah? Someone said that a day will come when your Last Judgment will happen. Why mention all these future events? Why talk about the future? Why mention the age of Kalyug? If everything had to be said at that time, then something or the other has to happen even in the age of Kalyug, and it's a very, very, very important and such a lofty and divine task that until you delve into it, you cannot understand it. Standing at the foot of a mountain, if you wish to see the splendor of a beautiful city, you cannot see it. You have to climb the mountain, and upon reaching its peak, you suddenly see, Wow, what an amazing sight we are beholding! In which world have we entered? It's not making sense to us. And if there is so much beauty, glory, and everything hidden within you, then hesitating to attain it doesn't seem like a wise decision to me. This suggests that people are not even prepared yet; they are still contemplating whether to attain it or not.

When your own possession is within you, when the Kundalini is within you, then why should you hesitate to attain it? Through the awakening of this Kundalini, you will understand that all the religions that have emerged, they are all like different flowers on the same tree, on the same living tree, they have come at different times, and those who brought them were all genuine people; they were all related to each other. But after they brought them, we plucked the flowers and took them into our possession, and started saying, These are our flowers, these are our flowers. And then these flowers died, and we are troubled for these dead flowers. We did not come in reality; if we come to reality, then these people are all relatives, and very close relatives, and everyone came into the world thinking that one after another, we will make people understand that this time is coming and in this era, you have to attain self-realization, and only then can you know God. Who hasn't said it? Jesus Christ said, Know Thyself. Who hasn't said this? Until today, if anyone picks up a book and looks, they will be amazed to find that all the great saints, sages, and incarnations, and prophets in the whole world have said the same thing: know yourself, recognize yourself. Now the question arises, how to recognize, how to know? So the same thing is that this is the power within you, it should be awakened and you will be able to attain it as soon as you awaken.

Some of you may also be suffering from some illness. It was told yesterday how the awakening of Kundalini can bring power into your chakras, which can cure your diseases. Now what can I say to you, but you know that only in Delhi city, two doctors in the university have received their MD degrees. Just yesterday, we went to Karnal and there was a gentleman who had never spoken since childhood. He was thirty years old, neither did he listen nor did he speak. He had never uttered a word from his mouth. Then as soon as he started practicing Sahaja Yoga, he began to speak, and now he is taking everyone's name. Here, there are also people whose blood cancer has been cured, many diseases have been cured. But no one has taken a contract, and Sahaja Yoga is not for curing any disease, it is for the awakening of Kundalini. If your Kundalini is awakened, then your diseases will also be cured, and you can never fall ill. If you are properly sitting in Sahaja Yoga and meditating, you cannot have any disease.

Now, after this, how this happens and how it affects our parasympathetic nervous system, all these things you can learn and understand at the center. For this, you don't need to give any money; there is no need to give anything. This knowledge belongs to the Divine, and you cannot pay anything for the Divine knowledge. Nor do you have any responsibility in it in any way. It's your own thing, find it and it's your own possession, understand it, and then immerse yourself in the infinite ocean; and whatever is written in the scriptures, it is proven by this. Pick up any scripture, there is no need to just ask something from the Bhagavad Gita or say, Please prove to us that this was written in the Ramayana or that it was written in it. In reality to understand them also it is very necessary to attain self-realization. Just like in the Gita, five hundred Gitas were written. If there is only one truth, then five hundred commentaries are written; if there is only one truth, then why are five hundred commentaries written? The reason for this is that not everyone's vision is subtle.

Now, take the instance of Gita itself, as people say that Krishna had already said to practice ‘Gyan Yoga’. People interpret ‘Gyan Yoga’ as reading, writing, memorizing books, and knowing a lot. This is not ‘Gyan Yoga’; this is actually Bhuddhi Yoga. This Bhuddhi Yoga is what makes a person egoistic. Those who give lectures on the Gita think they are Vyasa Muni himself and speak in such a way that it's astonishing. I feel irritated by them, as if, do not know what they are lording. They seem to be completely unaware, and they also charge a lot of money. Sometimes, they even charge five hundred rupees just for their ‘darshan’ because they narrate the Gita. But in these Gita discourses, the Gita is not narrated; they just speak nonsense of their own. I will explain it to you now. The meaning of knowledge is to know oneself. The word 'ग्न' (gna) or 'ज्ञान' (gyaan), both words are said in the same way. What you call 'ज्ञ' (jna) in the north is called 'ज्न' (jna) in the south; both are the same thing. Even before this, those who were the first disciples of Jesus Christ were called Gnostics. The Gnostics are those who have known, whom Buddha calls 'Buddh' (the enlightened one), meaning one who has known. To know does not mean to know with intelligence. Did these people go to college, university, or school? How did they know? They knew through their veins, they knew within themselves. This knowing is the path of knowledge, that's why Krishna said, you attain the path of knowledge. But Arjuna still asked the question, so he said, Okay, fine, you follow the path of devotion. On the path of devotion, he said, (Pushpam phalam toyam) Whatever flowers, leaves, water you offer me, I will accept, but made him dance, confused, on one word because He is Krishna. Krishna was very diplomatic. They knew that human intelligence is often distorted and works in other way round, so they thought that only a twisted finger would result in getting  ‘Ghee’ of the pot. They kept a word in such a way, they said that if you want to worship, then worship with exclusive devotion.

Now, when we say the word ananya, we mean that we engage in exclusive devotion. Ananya means when your relationship is solely with the Divine, then you become ananya. When there is no one else, when you come into singularity, they said to worship. They didn't talk about any other form of worship before that. But due to not understanding this word ananya, people think that if you chant Hare Rama Hare Krishna day and night, you will attain the Divine. You can never attain them like that. Instead, you might end up getting cancer. I am telling you this. This is because Shri Krishna, who resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra, if we take His name in such a frivolous manner, He is not in our pocket; He is not our servant whom we call upon all the time. Even if you take the name of an ordinary governor, the police will catch you, and the name of the Supreme Divine, who is the highest of all, is taken as if He is sitting in our pocket. As if He is so cheap that we can take His name anytime. And when we take His name in this manner, He becomes displeased, calamities befall us, and people ask, why did this happen, Mother? We do so much, chanted ten lakhs of times, perform this and that. You have no rights. You do not have rights; you are powerless until you attain unity. Therefore, your welfare is not considered. You gain nothing for your goodness, it’s just madness. First attain self-realization, and then with one letter, one letter of the name, the task will be accomplished. In your heart, they sit. With just one letter from them, your work can be done; in your work, completely you will feel as if you have entered the kingdom of the Supreme Being. In this way, all your work will continue to be done. But if you wish to take the name of the Supreme Being, chant their name loudly, do this in their name, build temples, honoring is all nonsense from around the world, if there was any benefit from them, it would have happened by now. Where has it happened? In which corner of the world has it happened?

People engage in various businesses in the name of religion. Tell me, in which corner, in which religion, has humanity benefited? Everywhere there is calamity, poverty, distress. There are so many diseases, so much dissatisfaction, and so many conflicts among the wealthy people. Why is this happening? This is what is to happen in the age of Kalyug; when people begin to understand like this, then people started saying that there is no God, there is no Supreme Being, and there is nothing like that which is God. In this way, many people became ready. Even by saying this, the Supreme Being exists, and it was not just your vision that was needed to know them, it was the vision you need acquire. When you know this, then your path of knowledge will be complete, and only then can you perform devotion. Then, in karma yoga, He has also shown His intelligence. Krishna used to play; he knew that through playfulness you all would be alright, so he played. In karma yoga, he made everyone dance on one word, that whatever action you are doing, do it, but surrender all actions at the feet of the Supreme Being. It cannot happen until you attain self-realization, until then your egoistic feeling that 'I am doing this' cannot go away. It cannot go away because you feel that 'I have done this'. So, then someone may even commit murder and say, 'I have surrendered to the Supreme Being, the Supreme Being has done it, the Supreme Being knows.' Even after doing wrong deeds, one can say, 'I have surrendered to the Supreme Being.' The feeling of ego is still within you, and with the support of that egoistic feeling, you are performing all actions, and you will always say that 'I have done it', this feeling will remain within you. But when the awakening of the Kundalini occurs, when the Agya Chakra opens up, then the Agya Chakra from both sides, (Shri Mataji places both her hands on her head on both sides), you see that inside you, a large heavy balloon-like structure of ego and conditioning is formed. This whole thing gets pulled inside, towards the inside, and the Kundalini rises out from your Brahmarandhra.

So, the actions you have, those which you say, 'I am experiencing the consequences of my actions,' all of those have ended. In animals, there isn't even a concept of karma. A lion, for example, can eat any animal and kill a cow, it can do any act. Any animal, whatever act it does, it is not considered a sin. It is only humans who think about sins and virtues, this is because of their ego, thinking 'I have done this deed, this is a sin, and this is a virtue. ‘And at the moment when this Kundalini pierces through your Agya Chakra, at that very moment, you will be amazed to see that both these institutions are pulled together, and you become completely clean, and your Kundalini rises from your Brahmarandhra, attaining unity. And that's why I keep telling you repeatedly to forgive everyone and forgive yourself too. This is how the Agya Chakra opens. The Agya Chakra opens through these two things. Its opening is very important. So, in this way, they have said about karma that karma has merged into akarma. Now, when people engage in actions after entering into Sahaja Yoga, what do they say? They say that Mother, this is happening, this is going on, and this is being created.

Look, we once went to America, and someone went with us. When their son came from Honolulu, she started saying, 'Mother, get him the realization.' I said, 'I can't do it.' So she started asking, 'Then what should we do?' I said, 'You do it.' Then she said, 'I can't do it either.' So I said, 'I can't give him a false certificate.' In this, a false certificate cannot be issued; there cannot be a false certificate. In Sahaja Yoga, you have to transcend, and beyond that, you have to evolve. It's not about putting a badge on your head and wandering around saying, 'We are Sahaja Yogis, we are followers of the World Pure Religion,' nothing like that. We have no membership here, nothing. You have to become. Just as a seed has to become a tree, similarly, you also have to become a tree. You cannot simply walk around with labels on yourself saying, 'I am this, I am that, I am a Sahaja Yogi, I have attained this,' these are not things that you can adopt. This has to happen within you, and gradually, the Kundalini makes you and there you have to pay attention when it comes to the question of the awakening of the Kundalini, then I would say that it can happen naturally. But after that, one has to tame it, one has to understand it, and watching its capabilities, observing how it can be utilized. You are amazed to see that you yourself merge into that power, the power starts flowing from within you, and it's so much fun to help people transcend, it's so much fun; that this thing can be learnt in the world so easily.

This kind of work should happen all over India, I told you, but most importantly, I would say it should happen in the city of Delhi because Delhi is the capital of India, isn't it? What happens here? Besides disputes, I haven't seen anything. Every time you ask about Delhi, this is what comes to mind, every time it comes to mind that they are quarreling, they are quarreling. Fighting in the name of religion is utter foolishness. Religion can never teach quarrels, can it? The Supreme Being is mercy, compassion; how can those who seek refuge in the shelter of the Supreme Being, who is an ocean of compassion, quarrel? Now, in Sahaja Yoga, there are people of all kinds, of all castes, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, people of all kinds, and everyone lives together with love. Such thoughts do not remain because when you find that one element and merge into it, and get immersed in its joy, then the differences disappear, and you feel like a tiny cell in the body of this vast entity. Or say that in this vast ocean, I am just a mere dot, but even that dot is lost, and with that loss, unity arises. I am the ocean itself. It's only when this happens that you'll realize the success of all the efforts you've made so far.

Now, when you return, you will understand what is good, what is bad, what benefited you, what did not, and you will be amazed that in foreign lands where people have forsaken the name of God and in countries like Russia where they did not believe in God, thousands of people, thousands of people have come to Sahaja Yoga. Even the government there has recognized Sahaja Yoga, to the extent that even the ministers there have acknowledged it. And here, despite engaging so much in religious practices, our heads don't seem to understand because there is something strange sitting on top of them, which is not a good thing. Now, this is about your benefit, about your own strength, about your own upliftment, and about the welfare of the entire world, which you understand, grasp with understanding, and get absorbed in.

I hope that next year I will come again, and I will meet all of you here, and we will have an interaction. And I will know who has achieved self-realization today and who hasn't. For everyone, I want to say that you should come to the center. Come to the center, fully understand and enhance your self-realization. Raise it, the way you wish to; and they will make you understand everything well. There are very good Sahaja Yogis here in Delhi. They will explain to you in a very serious way and infuse you with the consciousness that we have been hoping for till now. Infinite blessings to all of you.

Someone had asked for their son, so the response is, send your son's photo to the ashram, and later I will consider it. And if there are any other issues, send them to the ashram one by one. Now that you have entered the kingdom of God, it becomes our duty to resolve all your problems, dilemmas. But the biggest thing is that by realizing yourself, you can fix yourself. Because the water in which you were drowning, you have now risen from that water. Now that you are swimmer, you can jump back into that same water and save thousands. This was a significant state about which people used to say, 'Attain it effortlessly.' Initially, you will experience ‘nirvichara samadhi’, which is called thoughtless awareness, where you remain alert but thoughts settle within you. And then, another state will come, known as nirvikalpa samadhi, where no options remain within you, and from these waves of consciousness, you can perform various tasks. I hope you all have complete faith in yourselves and perform this task with full conviction, so that it doesn't remain incomplete, like seeds sown but left lying on the roadside. You all are capable of becoming trees, educated or uneducated, young or old, rich or poor, belonging to any caste, religion, or creed, residing anywhere in the world. This can be achieved by all of you. This is the heartfelt plea of a mother to all of you.

Yesterday, I said that the awakening of the Kundalini cannot be forced upon anyone; it can only happen when you ask for it in your own freedom. No one can force it upon you, no pressure can be applied. You must humbly ask, 'Mother, please give us self-realization.' Secondly, there are two conditions for this. The first condition is that you should completely forget your past, what has gone by, the previous time. Completely forget that life, that existence. At this moment, you are here in front of me, in the present. And the mistakes I made, the sins I committed, all those things—please forget them. I tell you, you have committed no sins, you have made no mistakes, and those who tell you otherwise are the real sinners. They have no right to say such things. So please forget these notions and do not think about such things at all. Maintain pride in yourself, hold self-respect. Because you are human, you are a person. You belong to the highest species on Earth, so do not degrade yourself and completely free yourself from these thoughts. At this moment, as you sit in front of me, do not think about the past, and similarly, do not think about the future. Secondly, you must forgive everyone right now, and do not think that forgiveness is difficult or how to do it. When you do not forgive someone, what are you really doing? Nothing at all. It is a false notion; that you can either forgive or not forgive. But when you do not forgive, you play into the wrong hands, and you end up tormenting yourself in the way that others intended to torment you. Therefore, please forgive everyone with your whole heart. You must adhere to these two principles because of the Agnya chakra. This chakra, as I mentioned yesterday, is very narrow, and these two habits are embedded in it. If you could somehow accept my conditions, I earnestly request you to please accept and do it.

Now, those of you sitting at the front, please remove your shoes and sandals. If you are sitting at the back, you should also do the same. Sit comfortably, as in *Sahaja Asana*. Sit in a relaxed manner—make sure not to tilt your neck too far back or forward, and do not slouch. Sit upright and relaxed. Now you need to place your left hand towards me. This indicates your desire to attain self-realization. The right hand will be used for action. With it, we will work on different chakras entirely on the left side, and we need to nourish and cultivate them in this way. This will make the awakening of the Kundalini easier, and you will be able to understand it further. Now, without any doubts, please place your left hand towards me. First, you should see how to place your hand on the different chakras, which will be shown to you. Alright, now place your left hand towards me, and put your right hand on your heart. The spirit resides in the heart; it is the reflection of the Supreme Spirit within us. But its seat, the place where it resides, is at the Brahmarandra, here at the fontanel, where there was a very small, soft bone during infancy, the fontanel. Now place your right hand on your heart. This is the seat of your spirit. After that, place your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen; this is the Guru Principle. Many ‘Sd Gurus’ have established this Guru Principle for us, and it is essential for it to be awakened, so that you yourself become your own guru. You now place your right hand on the lower part of your abdomen, pressing on the left side. This chakra is the center of pure desire, the chakra of pure knowledge, from which pure desire is awakened. Through pure knowledge, you can understand the laws of the Divine, because the Chaitanya (divine vibrations) will begin to flow from your hands, and as this Chaitanya flows, you will experience within yourself what is good and what is bad. All this knowledge, you can know and utilize through this chakra; it is the center of pure knowledge. Press it with your right hand; it is on the lower left side of the abdomen. Then, raise your hand and place it on the upper part of the abdomen, and then raise your hand again and place it on your heart. Now place your hand on the angle between your neck and shoulder, as far back as you can. Turn your head to the right, as far as you can. This Chakra that you have pressed here results in many troubles, if it becomes imbalanced. This chakra gets disrupted when you consider yourself guilty and think, 'I shouldn't have made this mistake; it's my fault; I committed this sin.' All such self-depreciating thoughts damage this chakra, leading to various problems such as angina, spondylitis, and other issues. Therefore, by turning your head to the other side, you must say, 'I am not guilty.' Now, place this hand horizontally across your forehead, on what is called the forehead or brow, and press both sides with your head bent down, as you would when you have a headache. This chakra gets affected when you do not ask for forgiveness, when you do not forgive, and when you keep thinking the same troubling thoughts. These problems get resolved as soon as this chakra opens up. Therefore, you need to forgive everyone here, without thinking about whom to forgive or what to do. Now, move this hand to the back of your head and lift your head upward completely. Without counting on your mistakes or considering yourself guilty, you should ask for forgiveness from the Supreme Chaitanya for any mistakes you might have committed, knowingly or unknowingly. Now you will have to press the palm of this hand, and the area between it, the palm and what we call the fontanel, which is a soft bone in childhood, place it evenly on the fontanel, pull your fingers outward, apply pressure, and bow your head completely. Now, pressing it and rotating it like the hands of a clock seven times, please rotate it seven times. Rotate it as if you are turning the hands of a clock, pulling your fingers outward, applying full pressure, and bowing your head slightly; this is a very important process, so do not do it lightly. Now, simply remove your hand. That's all you need to do. Now, you need to close your eyes and also remove your glasses until I say so. Please do not open your eyes until I tell you to. If you are wearing a necklace around your neck, remove it, not for women, but those who wear certain necklaces, some wear dirty threads, and remove them all. If your waist is tight, loosen it a bit, that's good. Now, close your eyes, left hand towards me, and right hand on your heart, on your heart. Now, here with me, ask me a question three times. This is very important, as I mentioned at the beginning, that a big truth about you is that you are a pure soul. So please ask a question here very importantly, 'Shri Mata Ji, am I a pure soul, Shri Mata Ji, am I a pure soul,' you may either say 'Mother' or may say  Shri Mata Ji. Say, 'Mother, am I a pure soul,' ask this question. Now, place your right hand on the upper part of the abdomen, pressing on the left side, this is the chakra of the Guru principle, if you are a soul then you become your own guru because in the light of the soul you understand everything. So ask this question three times again, "Shri Mata Ji, am I my own guru, Shri Mata Ji, am I my own guru," ask this. All this happens only by the grace of the ‘Great Gurus’and the ‘Sd Gurus’. As I already told you, this cannot be forced upon you, pure knowledge cannot be imposed upon you, so now place your right hand on the lower part of the abdomen, pressing on the left side. This is the chakra of pure knowledge, the chakra of ‘Maha Vidya’; I cannot force anything upon you here, so you will have to say six times, "Shri Mata Ji, please give me pure knowledge." You have to say this six times because there are six petals in this chakra. As soon as you said that you want pure knowledge, the awakening of Kundalini began, and Kundalini started rising upwards. Now you need to activate the upper chakras as well, manipulate them so that Kundalini rises properly upwards. Now place your right hand on the upper part of the abdomen and press it, place the right hand on the upper part of the abdomen on the left-hand side, and here, to fully assist these chakras, with full self-confidence, say ten times, "Shri Mata Ji, I am my own guru," say it with full self-confidence. You don't need to count your mistakes, you don't need to look down at yourself at this moment. With full confidence, say ten times, "Shri Mata Ji, I am my own guru." I have told you a great truth about yourself that you are not these body, intellect, mind, ego, etc., you are pure consciousness, and this is the truth. So please, with full confidence, place your right hand on your heart and with complete faith, with full self-belief, say twelve times, "Shri Mata Ji, I am pure soul, Shri Mata Ji, I am pure soul." Please say this twelve times. Now, understand one thing that the divine consciousness is an ocean of knowledge and love, it is an ocean of peace and joy, but above all, it is an ocean of forgiveness. Therefore, no matter what mistake you make, this ocean of forgiveness can absorb it within itself. So, place the angle between your right hand, neck, and shoulder, and turn your head to the right side. Here, with full self-belief, say, "Shri Mata Ji, I am absolutely not guilty, please say it sixteen times that I am absolutely not guilty, I have not committed any fault, I am completely innocent say it because this chakra is catching strongly onto all of you. I've told you before that many people say forgiving others is very difficult, but whether you forgive or not, you do nothing; you only torment yourself by falling into this myth. When you don't forgive someone, and the person who wants to torment you, it is you who torment yourself. So now, place your right hand on your forehead, on your forehead, and bow your head, press it from both sides, and press it, and say this with all your heart, say with all your heart that "Mother, I have forgiven everyone." Say it from your whole heart, forget all your pain, troubles, whatever you have endured, forget it all, and do not remember anyone completely, forgive everyone together. Now, place your right hand behind your head, and lift your neck as much as possible. Here, without counting your mistakes, without in any way lowering yourself, say with a full heart for your own resolution that, "O Supreme Consciousness, if I have made any mistake knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." Say it from your full heart, say it numerous times. From your full heart, lift your neck completely upwards towards the sky. Now fully open your palm and place the middle part of your palm, which was a soft bone in childhood, a sleek bone, exactly on the talu, and bow your head. Bowing your head, press your hand firmly, put good pressure with your hand, press it well, and pull your fingers outward so that the pressure feels good. Now rotate this hand seven times very slowly, like the hand of a clock, but exert force, this is a very important process. But here also, I cannot force you, so please, while rotating it, say it seven times with force, "Shri Mataji, please give me self-realization”, it cannot be forced, “Shri Mataji, please give me self-realization." Please say it seven times, press firmly, and pull it completely backward with force. Later, you will say, "I did not get self-realization." Now, bring your hands down and slowly open your eyes. Keep both hands like this, slowly open your eyes. In this way, both hands should be facing me and watch in thoughtlessness, watch in thoughtlessness, without any thoughts. Now, you put your right hand towards me like this, and bend your head, and with the left hand, look at this chakra, not too close, not touching, but from a distance, note that you feel any cool breeze on top of your head, do you? Now, the left hand towards me. Now, bend your head, and now, with the right hand, see if there is any cool breeze coming from your fontanel? Now place the left hand towards me again. Now, after bending the head again, see with the right hand if there is any cool breeze coming from inside it, or maybe warmth is coming. No harm if warmth is coming; whether it's cool now or later. Now, both hands towards the sky, and bend your head backwards, and ask a question: "Shri Mataji, is this the supreme consciousness? Shri Mataji, is this the divine power of the Supreme Being? Shri Mataji, is this the desire power of the all-pervading subtle Supreme Being? Ask any of these questions three times: "Is it the spirit? This is the supreme consciousness." Now, both hands down. Those who have felt cool breeze from their fontanel or both hands, all of them raise their hands. Everyone raise both hands. Today, everyone has transcended. There are very few of you who haven't. You have our infinite blessings, infinite blessings to all of you. Now that you've found this, you must continue to progress, not let it go. Consider this self-realization as your own, embrace it, and derive full benefit from it. May the Divine grant you wisdom? This is our blessing for you. If you have any troubles, any difficulties, you can write to us, and we will always be with you. You will come to our center, where you will be fully guided on how to progress further. We don't live in grandeur; our center is also quite ordinary. You should consider it as Mother's home and accept everything there with love. You all come with love, and everything will be explained to you with love, which you should accept. I hope that when I come next year, you all will have grown and progressed like tall trees.
