Shri Mataji what is sahaja yoga?

Sahaja - 'Saha' means 'with', 'ja' means born so it is born with you the right to become United which is the yoga with the divine and this this sahaja yoga is something that everybody can have is it is something everybody can practice of course and how does the this connection with the divine take place we have within ourselves this power in the triangular bone which is called a sacred meaning sacred which when awakened sprouts like a primule in a seed and rises through six subtle centers opens out the last Center and gets connected with the Divine which is a subtle energy all around us which organizes us which nourishes us does all the living work above all it loves us does this mean Shri Mataji that people who have not had the ability to practice Sahaj yoga are not connected with the divine most of them are not and if some of them are they don't know all about it so this is what a an extra force that is available to human beings to develop themselves in this world of course this is the last breakthrough of our evolution where you have to get connected with the divine you have to feel it on your central nervous system and that's how you get your self-realization. Do I perceive here that this is a way of balancing oneself of keeping in such a way of living one's life in such a way that one is not unbalanced in one's view of what is going on around us yes we have two sites in our system of autonomous nervous system left and right which recall is left and right sympathetic nervous system left-side caters for our emotions for our past our desires the right side caters for our action physical and mental if you indulge into one too much and go too far with it you develop an imbalance within yourself in the center lies the third power which we call as parasympathetic nervous system this is the channel which is the central path of ascent when the kundalini rises through it it brings you in the balance because it rises in the center of the system so this is the minimum that happens that you developed your balance so how does one actually achieve this balance it just happens spontaneously in other words there's no there's no physical requirement on an individual not at all not at all it's a evolutionary step as I told you in our evolution we have developed a balance we can stand on our two legs animals cannot in the same way you develop this special balance between your emotions and your actions in a very proper way you speak as though this is some sort of evolutionary step yes it is it is the last breakthrough that you have to become the spirit now and this has to be achieved which can be achieved only through a living process because we have become human beings through a living process and that living process has to act within us this sounds as though it is rather a significant time than in the in the history of humanity very much in the history of humanity in the history of evolution in the history of spirituality is the most important time because here where you will get whatever has been promised to you so far so it's no accident sahaja yoga has appeared in the world at this time no not at all not at all it's all predicted thousands of years back in India and later on by many Saints even William Blake has predicted it Shri Mataji you went to Russia last year and I believe the reception you got was most surprising yes I was myself surprised because thousands of people came and very sensible well-educated people came and they all settle down thousands I didn't know how to cope with that number because there were so many and even the members of the Supreme Council the government they came in that I could only say that in the so-called free societies we waste too much time experimenting with our freedom and indulge too much into the politics which is a waste thing I think the economics all these things while the people there didn't have any such chances so they put their energies to something that was higher than that they diverted and they were very knowledgeable they knew a lot about seeking they knew a lot about Kundalini and as if they were just waiting for me it was very remarkable mr. Gorbachev has said the Russians require a mental revolution do you see the acceptance of sahaja yoga as part of this revolution of course he himself is a saint and what he is meaning by mental then they should now understand that they have to develop that balance between communism and democracy our democracies are imbalanced they are one-sided they have no not the other side of collectivity but communism has collectivity it is power oriented our democracies are money-oriented what he is meaning is the maturity of our wisdom so yeah referring back to what we were talking about earlier is it okay as we were talking about earlier about bringing the human body into balance could could we say then that mr. Gorbachev is bringing the whole Eastern Bloc into balance yes yes they had one too much on one side and he's trying to bring them in the center you mentioned that you went to an Eastern Bloc conference last year and I believe you gave many influential people realization is it true that you believe that this was instrumental in helping the overthrow of oppressive communism it was a yoga yoga seminar and I expected all of them to be there and surprisingly I talked to them hardly for 30 to 35 minutes and then I gave them realization and all of them got it they were representative from all these Eastern Bloc countries when they got it they're so surprised at it then they walked out with me out for the hall and nobody was left in the hall listen to other people they gave me their addresses and they said we want this only in our country and they wanted to start our centers and I'm told they have already started centers the all-pervading power requires a medium to trigger something and when these people were created as realized Souls as they got connected with this all-pervading power I think they'd record it they had that confidence within them that courage in them because once we realized you become very courageous and you want to establish truth at any cost Shri Mataji the West shall we call it the Western nations have had sahaja yoga available to them to to investigate to to see for themselves how it worked for 20 years and yet it has been very slow to grow why is it happened this way do you think here people have so many diverse ideas about things they are very self-opinionated also about things and the so called man-made religions all over have also conditioned them too much they have other conditionings of different norms that they have as far as the social life is concerned and the physical appearances rather on a very superficial level so the people have not grown I think so much deeper of course I must say there are so many seekers in the West so many seekers and they were lost because as soon as people knew that there's a market for them the false gurus jumped out and they started preaching about false things just to earn money they were all money oriented people now there's another psychology with the Western mind that you must buy everything if something is not for sale then it is useless and this psychology has really deterred them to come to sahaja yoga very much because this is a living process and you cannot pay for it and they couldn't bear it I mean actually I must say one of the very important television gentlemen told me of that anglo-saxon brain cannot accept anything which cannot be sold I did not know what to tell him I just said who has made this brain his God has made then why is it so so you have an expectation really that the thing called sahaja yoga will change the world of course it changes human beings and they manifest a change outside and we create a new race that's what they're talking about if you want they talk of new age of a new race but I don't know what is there imagination about it they talk about all this thing Aquarius and Aquarius is the Kundalini she is placed in the Aquarius and they talk about Aquarius age all kinds of things they're talking writing thinking about it but when it comes to actualization I think they think I am very too simple for them not complicated and sahaja Yoga is too simple it should be very complicated and all their own ideas about seeking that this must suffer they must go to Himalayas they must starve themselves and then only they can get realization Shri Mataji is the evolution of the planet closely related to the evolution of humanity, of course it is very much related and the planet our planet is moving in a spiral way all the planets are moving in a spiral way and they are creating all possible things for the use of human beings so that they can save time save time forgetting their ascent and for meditative growth but people don't understand that part there are theories around now that the suggestions so we say that the planet could be a living organism a complete entity of course it is one of the examples of this one I can give you is that if you sleep under a coconut tree a coconut never falls on anything that is living whether it is a human being or a snake never falls that is so is it all around the world coconuts never fallen and living creatures so they understand we call it as Shri Pala because because we think that it is like a brain which understands well if this world is a living organism what is the brain what drives this being this organism what has made it evolve the way it has there is this subtle power which is all-pervading of God's love which manifests all the things like living work all nourishment all balancing it's so balanced in the Pacific was slightly deeper than this there would have been problems if Himalaya was say one and a half times then what it is there would have been problems so everything is so balanced in nature hmm and the Almighty has created only one word only we human beings have divided and moved like criminals with our passports in our hands Shri Mataji what we have been talking about many people would regard as a belief or a theory how does one know the difference between truth and a belief first of all anything for which you have to pay money is not the truth you can't pay for the truth if you cancel out that I think 99.9% all the falsehood will drop out but truth to be really actualized you have to have self realization then you feel on your fingertips vibrational awareness a new awareness a new dimension awareness by which you can make out what is true and what is false that's an absolute truth that you realize at that stage so one must have one's realization really to be able to tell the truth even want to follow anyone one must have realization Shri Mataji thank you very much thank you I was really an article just now where you were talking about inner peace and outer peace this seems to be something that attracts the attention of people in this present stressful age by realization what happens all to become a person endowed with thoughtless awareness that means you see everything you witness everything and whenever you want to say or to think you can see about it but you don't react there's no reaction so you are empowered to see it in such a manner that there need not be any thought just the whole creation acts on you it's a very subtle thing is to be experienced and that is the point where we realize that we are the source of peace and that's how our inner peace is established now people have many foundations of peace I have known all of them they have no peace within themselves some people have got peace Awards there are horribly hot-tempered people but they have got peace awards Nobel Prizes the peace has to be first of all found inside and then it manifests outside Shri Mataji the another question we wanted to ask you is because of this rather useful way you use your hands to describe the movement of the chakra when they when they they part I wonder if you could just explain why when illness occurs it occurs because of the movement away of one Center from another all right what I try to show them that this is the left side this is the right side this is the left sympathetic nervous system say and this is the right sympathetic nervous system and really spinal cord looks like this and inside here is the spinal cord which has the centers in it the subtle centers now when you start using the energy of these centers say too much on the right and it starts moving more towards the right and there's a constriction and the power becomes less because you are exhausting going more towards the right side suddenly something happens and from the left if there's a jerk then the connection is completely broken this is on its own it starts working on its own that's what you say that this has become malignant it has no relationship with the whole to have the proportionate growth so if the nose starts developing it can cover your eyes and govern your mouth everything this is how a cancer is setting or any other disease so many psychosomatic diseases are nothing but somatic is from the right side and when the psyche gives in then it becomes a psychosomatic disease there are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic than physical and these we call them as incurable can be easily cured by Kundalini awakening because when Kundalini passes through this she just integrates them for example she's going like this then she goes into this integrates them just like she strings them like pearls and so they have brought around and also she nourishes that Center that's how people get cured automatically by themselves by their own power Shri Mataji do you want to speak to the ABC in Adelaide this afternoon or would you rather that I rang them and said you're too busy abrupt yes I've been a lot of problems there abrupt and also very flippant type anything that's not I said they wanted to talk to you about false gurus and more okay few seconds what just do what all right they've been having a little trouble this morning you know we have banners to put up announcing your program tonight and they we had them on various bridges
