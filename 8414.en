Letter, May

You can cure human beings but cannot force them to accept me which it seems is the only condition that deities are not asking to compromise with. If it is not done by human beings sahaja yoga has to fail and we have to accept the verdict of the “Pralayankara”, the destroying aspect of God (Sadashiva).Jimmy Carther is talking about human right but does he know that human beings have crtain duties towards themselves? Does he realize that they have no right to spoil their Mooladhara and the Sushumna by their egoistical freedom? Does he understand that Americans are under another kind of captivity? It is your task to write in your book very clearly that they cannot proclaim anything about right and wrong when their own instruments are rotten.

yours most loving mother, Nirmala
