When I came to Sahaja Yoga, it was actually because of my father. He was really seeking a lot, and I was only a child, so I didn't know much about it. I was in Bombay—it's called Mumbai now—and I was going for my exams. Actually, the next day were my exams, and my father said no. He had got his realization just the day before. That was in 1972.

My father's story was that he told his best friend, "I want something that I don't have to depend on a guru for." Like normally in India, you know, gurus either take money or they have some sort of thing which they can't give to the disciples. And that was a very innate thing that my father really wanted. Being a child, I didn't know much about her, but I heard him saying that to his friend. I still remember that. He said, "It's nice to have something that I can stand on my feet and I can do something."

And his friend said, "Oh, really? I know a lady they call Shri Mataji. Why don't I take you there?" So, he went there, and he came home and said, "I've got this realization!" The next day was an exam, but he said they needed to call the family—my mother and my brother as well. We got a realization there, and that's it, really.

So, because it was 1972, I was about 17 years old. We had been to... it was in Mother's house, actually...
