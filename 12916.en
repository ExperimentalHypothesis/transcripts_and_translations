2SER FM radio Interview with Shri Mataji, Sydney (Australia) May 6th, 1987

Question: What is Sahaja yoga?

Shri Mataji: 'Sahaja-'saha means 'with',a means 'born'.Born with you is Sahaja. Yoga means union with the divine., that is 'spontaneous union with the divine.'

Question: And is it for all ages?

Shri Mataji: Yes. For all ages, for everyone. It is an evolutionary process which ends up with your ultimate goal and that is, to become the Spirit. And so it is meant for everyone.

Question: And how does it differ from other forms of yoga?

Shri Mataji: Other forms of yogas are leading to this one so that you are purified to receive this spontaneous yoga. But there is no need to do anywhere or do anything for this. You can get your realisation without doing anything, any one of them.

Question: What is Self-realization?

Shri Mataji: Self-realisation is that, so far the Spirit, which is in your heart, which is witnessing your activities, but does not come into play, into your actions nor into your intelligence, nor into your attention. But once you get Self-realized then the Spirit, the light of the Spirit shines and that's how your whole attitude towards life changes. You become a transformed personality.

Question: Are you the only person that can give Self-realisation?

Shri Mataji: No. There are many Sahaja yogis who can give Self-realisation to many people.

Question: Shri Mataji, the publicity I read you can actually give Self-realisation en masse?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Question: Why is it possible?

Shri Mataji: The time has come for giving en masse realisation I think and I am making the best of it.

Question is: And in what way does one's life change one's health after self-realisation?

Shri Mataji: A Sahaja yogi is a person whose guideline is his spirit. Thus he is standing at a point which is Absolute. He is not relatively looking after his life. He is on an Absolute point means whatever he does is the absolute truth. He doesn't take to anything that is an untruth which is false, which is superficial. That is how he is absolutely tranquil and peaceful and dynamic. And he has all the qualities of a very good gentleman like he is righteous, he is very pure and also he is very virtuous. We need people of that kind today, to make a new world.

Question: Do you think the world is in a very precarious situation?

Shri Mataji: It is.Very much. You can see all around. It is in a very precarious way placed and this is the time when one starts thinking of something better or to get out of it and that is the time it works out the best.

Question: What are the other countries is there, Sahaja yoga?

Shri Mataji: There is a big list. There are about fourteen to fifteen countries involved in Sahaja yoga. To name them, we can say, in U.K, France, Spain, Austria, Australia, of course, is first. Then we have on the other side Switzerland, Germany. What else, America.About fifteen countries altogether.Algeria.

Question: Why are you called the Mother?

Shri Mataji: 'Mother'.Because I gave them the second birth(.laughs)

Question: That is a very simple answer.

Shri Mataji:(laughs) That is the answer. The one who gives you birth is the mother, isn't? That's how they call me the Mother. But also the mother's qualities are needed today. The patience, the love, the compassion, the understanding and also commanding the confidence of all the children, is only in a mother. That is why it is better to be a mother.

Question: How difficult do you think is to live a life once you become involved in Sahaja yoga?

Shree Mataji: It is the easiest life to lead because you then come across people who are very good. They are of the same type, a good rapport is there. Very great friendship, a big fraternity. And also you find life much more interesting that you don't think about them but you enjoy everything. So life is much easier after Realisation. You are dynamic. Your problems get solved. Your health improves. So in every way, it is such a great blessing.

Question: I don't have any more questions but is there anything else you would like to add?

Shri Mataji: Yes. That now we are standing at a point where the evolution has reached us to human awareness and that is not absolute. We have to jump to higher awareness and that is the last Spirit and that one has to be achieved by everyone. Otherwise, there is no solution to all kinds of problems people are facing today.

Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Has it come alright? (referring to the recording)

Interviewer: I hope so. I will rewind a little bit. (checks the recording)

Shri Mataji: I would like to add something. This is a living process. Living process of evolution for which you cannot pay. This is one thing people should understand that you cannot pay for anything that is spiritual. Anybody who collects the money in the name of God is doing the wrong thing. So one has to be careful that you cannot pay for your evolution. Should be understood logically and then you must act that don't trust people who ask for money for anything that is spiritual. Very good questions.Straight forward. Yeah.

Shri Mataji: I did not give all the names of all the countries. I do not know which I missed('Belgium and Holland' from a person with Mataji) India. Mataji laughs. Belgium and Holland, I missed. India of all the things. (laughs)

( Shri Mataji talks to the other people in the room)

Interviewer: I can give that in the introduction. I can say there are some more countries.

Shri Mataji: That you can say. You see anything after all missing India is alright. Doesn't matter. What radio is it?

Interviewer: It is 2SER.F.M and tonight what I will do is., take it and edit it and prepare it so I can broadcast it tomorrow. Between 10 to 12.because public program is tomorrow on Friday night so have to go on air.

Shri Mataji: Tomorrow is the program, isn't? Tomorrow night?

Interviewer: Yes. Tomorrow night.

Shri Mataji: You have to give the place.

Interviewer: Yes. I will do that.

Shri Mataji: Yes, tomorrow night. Before that, if it's, you must also give the place. This is the place we are having it. Otherwise, they will telephone you one after another.

Interviewer: We will do that. Anything that was not covered in that, I can actually cover in the introduction or the conclusion.

Shri Mataji: I think it is alright. It is very straight forward. See for any common people when they are listening to the radio they do not want to hear a big sort of philosophical treaties. They are very happy with small crisp little answers which goes into their heads very easily and the curiosity is there and so they come to the program. That is much better.

(Shri Mataji talks with other people in the room.)

Sydney people are much more receptive. Arent they? Even that gentleman was alright, was so anxious to get his realisation and he was in a big hurry to see his kundalini. The kundalini was rising but he couldn't feel it. It used to go back to his sushi, go back to his Kabhi. I didn't know what to do with it. Poor fellow.

(One person in the group): there has been a big difference Mother, since Sunday. I came back early and was talking to the press since Sunday. The people who were not interested at all are now interested. Changes are starting already.

Shri Mataji: The atmosphere changes, then everything changes.

Another person: I was trying to contact Aurangabad. Very strange contractors But my inclination was different. She asked are you from Australia? I said no, I am from India. She said you have come recently? I said, this morning. Where are you staying? I said I am staying in an ashram, Sahaja yoga ashram. She said, What is this ashram..? I said my sister 'Mataji' and she has founded this Sahaja yoga Ashram and people belong to Sahaja yoga. She said, is it Nirmala Devi Ashram? I said, yes, but how do you know? She said e have been reading in the papers.

Shri Mataji: Who are these people?

Person: The local telephone operator. I was really surprised.

Shri Mataji: No, you know, if the media wants, actually it is en masse and also there was never a media like this. If the wants they can help the whole world. Isn't it? They have to give the truth to the people, but if they do not want to do it then they are the ones who are held responsible.

Person: The media is divided into two parts.One who gives real truthful accounts and the other which does not.

Shri Mataji: Another thing is also that you see when they become sort of doubtful about it, they say first give us the Realization and then we will do it, which is very difficult. Sometimes you can't give them. It is being very selfish but I can't give Realization to someone, doesn't mean there isn't anything like that. But in Italy, when I went there, there was a fellow called Ramano. He was a big fan of people and a very interesting person. He said, Mother, I must ask you one thing. I said what? Please give me a Realization. I said I have to broadcast. Mother first give me Realisation. It will be a good idea. Then I gave him Realization. Then he laughed and laughed. The joke is over. The joke is over. (Shri Mataji laughs) What about our program? He said, No, no, we will have the program. Then we went to a place and then he said these people are monkeys. They cannot understand Sahaja yoga. I said,' Why?' He said they won't understand any Sahaja yoga, Mother. You just don't talk to them. Then he gave me big publicity in Milano. Then we went to a hill station. There we gathered about six to seven hundred people there and gave me such big publicity, the Romano fellow. Wonderful person.

One person in the room: It is very different this time Mother. Last time, your last visit the people in the press wanted something sensational, they wanted something clever, a big trick. This time the same people are not interested. This time the people who are showing interest are receptive to the message. It's quite remarkable. Same thing happening in Melbourne too. All the sensationalist are not interested. So hope we get very good coverage.

Shri Mataji: This sensation business also comes from materialism I think. Human beings are becoming matter. So they need some sensations to come up to something. They cannot see something which is very obvious and good for them. They need some sensations. Like this gentleman asked me, we have to go outside on the street. I said street it won't work out because it is quite a serious subject. How can I discuss with you on the street? He compromised for the garden and we went to the garden and all the cloud started pouring there. Then he said that is over and we start the whole thing and it started raining and afterwards he gave up.

Another person: Started raining just when we were trying to give him Realization. Heavens were warning us.

Shri Mataji: You see, there are people who are thinking, who are worried, who want to do something great. But we have to approach them somehow. The approach has to be built up. Once that is built up there is no problem. That is the main thing. The right type of people we should meet. Like the first time whether n I went to Italy, we had informed the newspaper to advertise and I stayed in a hotel. One girl was with  me.No body contacted us.No body came in the hall. Not even a single soul. Nothing was done. Nothing worked out. So we went back spending so much of money. And now in Italy, can you imagine, at the airport, if you go, the whole airport is full of Sahajayogies. It happens like that. Same with our  Calcutta. First time when I went to Calcutta there was one person in the hall. And this time when I went there the biggest hall they have, was given to us and the crowd was so much and they were saying' Ma, ma' and nobody could come inside because the hall was full. Thousands and thousands were waiting outside. And now it has taken such a form, even the cinema actors went there to collect money for our school in Calcutta. You can't believe the same Calcutta where there was only one single soul in the big hall and I thought this fellow will also run away after five minutes(laughs). It does change gradually. But one should not be shocked with the first appearance.

Thank you very much.

All the people: Thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: God bless you.

(She leaves the room.)
