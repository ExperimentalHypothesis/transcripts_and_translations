[in the TV Programm [yoguini translating Shri Mataji's interview]:

Presenter:---What is Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji:---Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous happening within us, which is the last breakthrough of our evolution, by which you ascend into a new awareness, that you become the Spirit.

Presenter:---And how one practices Sahaja Yoga? Is it like the commom Yoga ?

Shri Mataji:---No, it is not. It is something internal. There is a power within us. It germinates, and gives you this connection with this all-pervading Divine power.It is the Yoga.

Presenter:---...a connection with a power that exists within us, which is Divine, isn't it? And how can we get in contact with this power?

Shri Mataji:---It is just like a living process. Like we plant a seed in the Mother Earth and it sprouts. In the same way, it just happens.You have to come to My programm and it will all work out.
