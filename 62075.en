... I mean to say that you should not feel guilty at all. Because, logically, what do we do if we feel guilty ? Make ourself miserable! that’s all! And after all we are human beings – only human beings can make mistakes. We are not gods! Moreover, this Divine Power I’m talking about is the ocean of forgiveness: so, what mistakes can you commit that it cannot dissolve? Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Now some may say it’s difficult to forgive. Now, logically, what do we do if we forgive or don’t forgive? What do we do? Nothing! What we do really, is to torture ourselves. We play in the hands of wrong people, and this centre then (Shri Mataji puts Her hand on Her forehead) catches very badly, and it’s a narrow door, the Kundalini stops. Then how can I give you Realisation? You are not going to miss your Realisation by not forgiving people, that means we play more into their hands, that you miss such an opportunity.

I hope you are convinced now for both the conditions are absolutely important because we have to enter into the ocean of joy. The religion of Sahaja yoga is to know yourself and to enjoy. No austerities, no sacrifices, no crucifixion, nothing! You yourself will know what is enjoyable and what is not enjoyable. So I hope you will comply with these two conditions first and be pleasantly placed towards yourself, that’s very important: not to be angry with yourself but completely forgive yourself. Alright? D’accord (repeats Shri Mataji after the translator).

We don’t have to be in a very serious mood you see. We have not to climb Himalayas. No, no, it’s very simple, we don’t have to climb Himalayas. It’s very very simple – because it is so vital. Alright.

Now, one humble request is to take out your shoes if you don’t mind. This Mother Earth helps us. As I told you, the left side and the right side: the left side is the power of desire and the right side is the power of action: so we put both the feet on the ground, separately, fully touching the Mother Earth. One has to sit not in any tension, but not also bending down, just straight like that, but not with any tension. And the left hand has to be towards Me like this, you can put it on your lap. And with the right hand, you have to nourish your centres. (Some Sahaja yogi should come and show).

Now, first we’ll show you what is to be done, and then we’ll close our eyes. First we put our hand on our heart where resides the Spirit. Then we take our hand on the left hand side of our abdomen, in the upper part. This is the centre of the mastery: if you become the Spirit, you become your own master, you don’t need any guide.

Then you take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen: this is the centre of pure knowledge which manifests on your central nervous system. We are working only on the left hand side. Now we take our right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Then take our right hand on our heart. Then this hand goes – right hand – in the corner of our neck and our shoulder, as far back as possible, and then we turn our head to our right. This centre is caught or is blocked when we feel guilty, and it is very dangerous because it causes diseases like angina, spondylitis and many others.

Now, we take this hand across our forehead and bring down our head on the hand, slowly, till it rests on it, and now we press it on both the sides. Now, this is the centre of forgiveness.

Now we take our hand on the back side of our head, and push back our head, slowly on it, till it rests well. Here we have to say that – without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction – you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine.

Now, we have to stretch our hand, and we have to put it on the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in our childhood. And now we have to put down your head as much as you can, and push back your fingers, and press your scalp well and move it seven times slowly, very slowly seven times, clockwise. Push back your fingers, push back. That’s all we have to do.

Now please close your eyes and don’t open them till I tell you, because your attention is drawn inside. Now please put again your feet again apart from each other – you can take out your glasses. If there is anything tight in your neck or in your stomach you can loosen it a little bit. Please put your left hand towards Me now: that is symbolically you’re desiring to get Self-Realisation.

Now please put your right hand on your heart: here now, you have to ask Me a question – you may call Me Shri Mataji, or if you like it you can call me Mother – Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask this question in your heart, three times: “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

If you are the Spirit, you become your master. So please take down your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Here, you have to ask another question to Me: “Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this question three times.

Now as I have told you, I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So you have to put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, and here you have to say, in your own freedom, “Mother, please give me pure knowledge”, six times, because this centre has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward. So we have to nourish the upper centres with our self-confidence.

Now please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and say with full confidence ten times: “Mother, I am my own master.”

Now we have to know, that we are not this body, we are not this mind, we are not this intellect and we are not these emotions. We are not our conditionings nor we are our ego. Because we say my ego, my emotions – my – we don’t say I emotions. So with full confidence, we have to see the greatest truth about ourselves: because you are pure Spirit. So please raise your hand to your heart, and with full confidence you have to say, twelve times, “Mother, I am the Spirit”.

Now, I have already told you about this Divine power of Love: it is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness! So as I have told you, you cannot commit any mistakes which cannot be dissolved by this great ocean. So now please, raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, as far back as possible, and turn your head to your right. Here now with full confidence you have to say sixteen times, sixteen times : “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” I’ve already told you at the very beginning, that you have to forgive everyone. This is a very important, extremely important thing to be understood. So please forgive everyone and put your right hand on your forehead across. Now put down your head as far as you can, press it on both the sides.  Now with full confidence, not how many times, from your heart please say: “Mother I forgive everyone.”

Now, from your heart, take back this right hand. Push back your head on it fully. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to say for your own satisfaction – from your heart, not how many times – “Ô Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

Now stretch your hand, and put the centre of your palm on your head, on the fontanelle bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head and press it hard, pushing out your fingers completely. Again, I cannot cross over your freedom: you have to ask for your Self-Realisation, in your freedom and glory. So move your scalp seven times very slowly clockwise, saying “Mother, please give me my Self-Realisation”, with humility.

Please press it hard, pushing back your fingers. (Seven times Shri Mataji blows Her Divine Breath into the microphone.) Now please take down your hands. Now put your right hand towards Me and bend your head, and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Please keep it away from the head – some people get it much further. Better is to bend your head.

Now please put left hand towards Me, and see with the right hand if you can feel the cool Breeze. Some might feel hot, doesn’t matter, but it is opened out. Now again please, the right hand put towards Me, with the left hand see if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now, push back your hands, push back your head, and ask three times any one of the following questions: “Mother, is this the cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?”, “Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God’s Love?”, “Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya?” Ask anyone of these three questions.

Now, take down your hands please. Put both the hands towards Me, and watch Me without thinking. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, open your eyes. Open your eyes. Put the hands like this (Shri Mataji holds both Her hands open in front of Her, above Her lap.) Now those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands, or hot, – and those who have felt – or those who have felt the cool breeze through their head, please raise your both the hands. Ô My God! All of you?! May God bless you, may God bless you! All of you have felt it, just imagine! Very few have not. May God bless you.

Doesn’t matter: those who have not felt will feel it tomorrow, and tomorrow I’ll explain to you more about it. Also please bring your friends because this is the greatest thing you can give to your friends. And now, you enjoy!

I would like to meet you people if you want to meet Me, one by one – just to, just to shake the hands.

Many people come to the stage. “Got it?! May God bless you! I could see that. You got it in a very good way.”

We can’t hear Shri Mataji, but the translator says in French: you mustn’t think, just stay relaxed. It is very important not to think now.

A bit further, as we cannot hear Shri Mataji speaking to one seeker; the translator translated Her by saying You must not think, just stay relaxed. And Shri Mataji to another lady who came to shake hands but we can’t hear Her words, the translator says in French:  Whatever is wrong I will say. If you are wearing something that will hurt you, Madame, you should take it out.

At 37:21 this is the end of hearing Shri Mataji. The video continues with some yogis interviewing people who just got their Realisation.
