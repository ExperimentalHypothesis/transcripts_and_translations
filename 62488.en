Public Program, Budapest, Hungary, 23-07-1990

I bow to all the seekers of truth. As I have told you yesterday, truth is what it is. Truth is what it is. We cannot organise it. And we cannot conceptualise it. And also at a human awareness we cannot feel it. In the evolutionary process, we have come from Amoeba to the state. But still what we find is the chaos. So many opinions, ideologies and so many identified with that. So the absolute truth has to be won. In this evolutionary process whatever we have been. Is expressed on our central nervous system.

For example, if you take a dog or a horse into a dirty place, they do not feel the dirt. But a human being can feel that it is dirty, that it is filthy and smelly. That shows that human beings are a aware. That their awareness has a vital dimension. It is not a mental projection. It is not any imagination. It is the reality that you can feel on your central nervous system. For that, something has to happen for this last breakthrough of our evolution. So we manifest the new dimension of our awareness which I told you yesterday was corrective consciousness. That means on our central nervous system that is on the tips of our fingers we should feel this all-pervading power. And that we should feel our own subtle centres as well as the subtle centres of others.

This happening takes place spontaneously. Because it is a living process. So first we know that there is a power, a living power, which is the power of love. Second thing is that to feel that we have to become the Spirit. To become the Spirit we have a mechanical within us. That is already being described to you. If you are just now, I happen to meet the people who were selling this Gita. People say Gita or they sell, say, Bible or Koran or all these things. These are scriptures. And they are holy scriptures. They are holy scriptures. But these are prescriptions. If we give you a prescription that for your headache you take this particular medicine. And if you just go on reading the prescription will your headache go? You have to take the medicine. And the medicine is the awakening of your Kundalini. All these books can be very easily explained and proved after you have got your realisation. Even in Vedas it is written that after getting self-realisation you should know about tantra, yantra and mantra. Tantra, yantra, tantra and mantra. So, the first one, yantra means the mechanism. And tantra means the technique. And mantra means the chanting which is to be used for opening your centres. Sahaja Yoga relates to all the scriptures, to all the incarnations and to all the prophets. It relates to science. Especially medical science. And all sciences which deal with human beings.

So today I told you, I will tell you about the truth. That is the spirit. When you get your self-realisation, what happens? The spirit which is just a little light in the heart, which is the reflection of the God Almighty, gets as if ignited by the rising Kundalini. And the attention becomes enlightened. So, we feel on our central nervous system the collective consciousness. And very well you put your attention. You can find out what is the problem of a particular person. If you really involve yourself well, then you can, sitting down here, can cure the problems of that person. The attention works through eyes. But eyes become so innocent. And with such pure love, that they are effective. Whenever such a person even puts a glance, it works for the benevolence. Christ has said, thou shalt not have adulterous eyes. But we do not find such eyes. They are full of greed and lust. Now by denial or by penance or asceticism, these things do not disappear, they are suppressed. They do not, they do not disappear, but they are suppressed. But with the realisation, the eyes become innocent. Automatically. There is a clint in the eye of the Spirit. So the attention is enlightened, by which you know what is benevolent for you and what is not.

Now supposing there is somebody who comes down and says that this is the truth and this is the right thing to do. How will you make it out? If somebody says, I am Christ, how will you make it out? You will have to feel the vibrations and immediately you will know the truth. Say, even if there are ten children who are realised souls and you dry their eyes, and ask them, this gentleman who is before you, what is the problem? And immediately they will put up the figure that is burning or is charted or in any way in something different experiencing. They will say, they will say the same thing. And you ask the gentleman, are you suffering from this? Yes, he will say, yes, how do you know? Only think what he is saying. All you have to know is the decoding of these feelings. And then how to overcome the problem. If you know these two things, you can master it. The nature of spirit is that it is a collective being. It is a collective being. And so a person becomes collective being. To him everybody is a part and parcel of his own being. And he is a part and parcel of the great being. As I said yesterday, the microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

Spirit is the source of peace. As I told you that, you get into the state of thoughtless awareness, which is... In Sanskrit it is called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Nirvichara Samadhi. And then once you go little higher or deeper into your own being, then there is another state called as doubtless awareness. Which is called as Nirvikara Samadhi. Nirvikara Samadhi. All right, they have got it. Now, in this state you become empowered. To raise the Kundalini of others. Give realisation. And as a by-product you cure yourself.  The other day I met a lady from Hungary who is cured of her cancer. Not by me, but by Kundalini awakening. And some Sahaja Yogis have done the job. The source of knowledge is also the Spirit. The absolute knowledge. You can find out about everything through this source.

Now the light of the Spirit which spreads in your brain, you become extremely intelligent, dynamic and creative. Creative. Many musicians, artists have been through Sahaja Yoga. But these are only the outward temptations. The main thing is that you become peaceful and joyous. Joy is not a duality. It is not happiness and unhappiness. It is a state...

I hope in Hungary, Sahaja Yoga will work out. We've been trying to get some centres, but rather difficult to get a permanent centre just now. But temporarily we have been able to manage something. Now as you are getting exposed to the democratic ways of life, it is very important that you first get your self-realisation. The countries who are supposed to be democratic without self-realisation have gone amok. The problems they face are something which can never be solved. There is no balance, there is no control. It is no more freedom but an abandonment. And all kinds of diseases, all kinds of ecological problems. I feel without realisation people don't even understand how to use the power. How to use money and how to love each other.

So it's the right time somehow I could come to Hungary. I will be going away tomorrow and may not be back for one year at least. But there are so many Austrians and in Austria Sahaja Yoga is a very powerful. And they are going to come off and on. And they will make masters out of it. Then you people will have to go to other countries to give them realisation. As I told you, it's a worldwide organisation. It is not an organisation because we do not have any membership but there is no word for such a thing. And I must tell you that when I came last I didn't know about [UNCLEAR Thakur] although now [UNCLEAR Thakur] was here in this place. I came here and he has described that on the shores of [UNCLEAR] our country India, the people from all over the world, all over the races will come. And exactly this happens every year. We meet in a place called the Ganapatipule in a place near the shore. People from all the countries, from all the races and from all the religions. And enjoy each other's love. So I invite you also to come.

May God bless you all.

Yesterday I am sorry people had to leave because of their trains. So today we will have the realisation first. I must say that we cannot force. You have to ask for self realisation in your own freedom. Because this is a total freedom. No habits, no ego, no conditioning, no [UNCLEAR]. And no wrong identification, nothing can dominate you. So it is important that you have to ask for self realisation in your own glory. It will take about 10-15 minutes. But those who want to leave, please leave now. It cannot be worked on people who do not want their self realisation. Because Kundalini is the one that connects you to this power. It is the power of pure desire. All other desires are transited. Today you want something, tomorrow you want something. And you never feel satisfied. With whatever you have. So this is the pure desire which once manifested your whole priority has changed.

So many are waiting outside. These people who do not want to have the realisation, they are waiting outside. So many are waiting outside. I will [UNCLEAR press]. All right.

Now, I have told you already that there are two conditions. The first one is to forget the past. When I say you forget the past, I mean you are not to feel guilty for anything. Whatever your mistakes you might have committed, your Kundalini knows that very well. And she will manage. You don't have to feel, you don't have to feel guilty about it. If you feel guilty as I told you, your centre here on the left side catches very badly. And then, and then Kundalini doesn't rise. Still I was saying yesterday, I think, people got realisation. But today they have to be again, established. And those who haven't got should know that they did not forgive you. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. If you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Also you torture yourself. While the one who wants to torture you is quite happy. So, the second condition is very simple, is to forgive everyone in general. You don't have to remember every person whom you have to forgive. So, these are the two conditions which you have to please fulfil. If you do not forgive, then the centre here on the optic chasma like this is closed. But if you forgive, it opens out and allows the Kundalini to pass. I just want to say that are you going to miss your self realisation for that.

So, there is somebody who will show you first of all. Before that we'll have to take out our shoes. Take the help of the Mother. Now these, both the fields are to be kept apart from each other. Because as I told you, there are two powers, one is left is the power of desire. Not of pure desire, but desire. And the other one is the power of action. So, if you put the left hand towards me like this on your lap. That's what we have to do. But again I say, many have not put back their fingers. Unless I think there's pressure, it will not be so easy. Now, please keep both the feet away from each other. You have to close your eyes, you can take out your spectacles because till I tell you, you don't have to open your eyes. As I have told you, you have to be very pleasant with yourself.

Now put your right hand on your heart, close your eyes and put the left hand on your lap towards Me. If you want to call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suits you, here you ask Me a question three times, which is a very fundamental question. Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask this question three times. If you are the Spirit, you are the light and you are the guide and you are your master.

So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and ask the question, Mother, am I my own master? Ask this three times. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here please ask, Mother, please give me pure knowledge. You have to say this six times because this centre has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward. So we have to nourish the higher centres with self-confidence.

So now place your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, left hand side. Press it hard and here you have to say ten times with full self-confidence, Mother, I am my own master. I have already told you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect, you are not this ego or your conditionings but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand onto your heart and here with full confidence please say twelve times, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. This all-pervading power of love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of joy but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot do anything wrong which cannot be dissolved by this power.

So now please raise your hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck, push it as far back as possible and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty at all. I have already explained that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you do not do anything, it is a myth. But you are playing into wrong hands and torturing yourself.

So now raise your hand onto your forehead across and press both the temples with your thumb and the finger and bend your head. Now please here say, Mother, I forgive everyone. Don’t think of individuals. It’s not how many times but from your heart you have to say. Please forgive.

Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head, on the back side. And push back your head as far as possible. Now, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes. For your own satisfaction you have to say, All-pervading power of love if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me. This also you have to say from your heart.

Nowthe last centre of thousand petals. Stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on the fontanel bone area and bend your head. Here you have to put a proper pressure by pushing out your fingers. Now again I cannot cross over your freedom, you have to ask for self realisation, the glory of your freedom. So now please move the scalp very slowly, seven times clockwise and seven times along with it you have to say, Mother please give me self realisation.

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone]

Now please take down your hands. Put both the hands towards Me and please open your eyes. Please try to watch Me without thinking. Now push back, push your hands up there and push back your head and ask a question three times, Mother is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading power of love?

Now please put the right hand and left hand like this. And left hand towards Me and the right hand facing the, facing the fontanel bone area. Now bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. That may be hot also. Don’t put the hand on top of your head but away from it. Some people get it much further.

Now put the right hand towards Me like this. And please put the left hand on top of your head away from it and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out. Now, please put the left hand and put down again the right [hand]. See with the right hand. Might be hot but you must forgive. Now again raise your hands and push back your head. Ask the question, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading power? Ask this question three times. Now take down your hand. Just watch without thinking.

All those who have felt the cool breeze on their hands or out of their heads or the hot breeze, please raise both your hands. Please raise both the hands, so I'll see. I bow to all of you. I bow to them. Only thing now we have to develop it. Those who did not get realisation also can get it. They can come to the stage .

Yogi: It's very important that all of you come to our follow-up programs to stabilise the process.

Shri Mataji: Some please want to meet Me? I would like [UNCLEAR too].
