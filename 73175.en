[Starts at 6:42]
Shri Mataji: What about breakfast, you never had anything or you had?
Sahaja Yogi: Did you have something?
Gregoire: Mother, we’ll have lunch in about one hour. There are some new people who have just come. Maybe you can work on them.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Sahaja Yogi: Would you like some tea, Mother? Or something, the brunch is ready.
Shri Mataji: I’ll have some tea. Did you have something to eat in the morning? Did have.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Those who did not, have to have. You want to have something? All right. What do you want?

[Unclear conversations in the back]

You are the new people who have come?
Yes, we taught Kundalini. Hum? This one is an old one of mine.
[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: Hum?
Seeker: [Unclear] you are in your heart.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. You are so many things. You are not only your heart. There are so many things, you see? You are much more than that. Everything, of course, surrounds heart. But heart is a very big thing, you know. What we think of heart is a very limited stuff. It is a very big thing.
Seeker: Yes. Now everything seems to come back to the heart since I was in [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s true.
Seeker: It seems to come back to the heart.
Shri Mataji: No doubt. Sincerity is in the heart, no doubt. But it has to throw lights on something else, isn’t it? You must express your sincerity in your life.
I mean, if it is just there, hanging in air, then what’s the use? It has to work on something. It has to reflect on something. It has to show its results. So, you must have a reflector of that type.

Seeker: In action.
Shri Mataji: Yes, in action in behaviour and everything.

Take it from the book if you want to. All right. Yes, yes.

Frank [unsure] is very happy, I tell you. Some music amongst the Sahaja Yogis, you see. That’s one side where we, in London, is our music party. We don’t sing and we don’t have - music is very important because that carries the vibrations much better, you see. And I think we should somehow, compose some poems and put them into tunes and - Patricia can compose it and you can really have some nice music played. And music is very good, you see.
I would say sounds. Sound is one of the carriers of vibrations. Our music is organised sound, organised for evolution.

And the confusion about organised and disorganised is so complete that we don’t understand the thing that is organised, works out for our creation and for our construction, can be disorganised and can work out the other way round. Because of this confusion, people don’t understand different things, you see.

Like the other day, as I was telling you, that somebody asked me, "What is the difference between a prostitute and a housewife?" I said, "Very nice". I mean, something like asking, "What is the difference between the fire that burns the house and the fire that is lit in the hearth where you cook?" So, it is so confused, you see, this is the time of confusion. Modernization means confusion, I think, because we are confused about everything. All of our values are confused. All of our fundamental things are confused. And simple things we do not understand, you see. It has become really a confused stuff.

But to overcome confusion, first of all, we must see the different things. Then they integrate them properly. That’s the only way we can bring forth the chaotic conditions under control, and can have some integrated things. So there is a difference between integration and confusion. People confuse integration with confusion. So you have to integrate all these seven chakras and their seven qualities within you. But not to confuse. And this confusion can be only overcome through vibrations. Otherwise, you cannot overcome it. Because first of all, you have to have something absolute to take out your confusion. If you do not have something absolute, then you are confused.

Somebody said, "What, what is there to have children and not to beat them? " No, what it’s, there’s a confusion. "What’s wrong in this? " and "What’s wrong in that? "It’s all out of confusion you ask such questions. If you can feel the vibrations, if you can have a rapport with the Absolute, then you can understand that this is absolute and this is a relative. And relative is not to be confused with absolute. That’s how confusion can be over. And it is inevitable, confusion is inevitable when there is at random growth, you see, this side more and that side less, and this side more and that side less.
So, confusion is the only outcome of such a growth, you see, which is at random without any idea of the Whole, you see. It is malignant. It grows on itself and then it is killing others. And that’s how the confusion starts.

So the complete integration has to come in. All these powers, say sound power now, as I said, there is power of light. And there is power of water. And there is power of this earth. And there is power of air, firmament. All these powers are to be brought into integration together.
How do you get it? How do you do it? By holding their reins into your hands. Now how do you hold their reins? The reins are the things that go absolutely in the centre of it, you see, like a rib inside or you can say like the spinal cord inside. So, you catch all of those reins in your hands, and that’s how you remove the confusion.

And this is the best way you can do it. How do you hold the reins? Again, the question comes in, how do you hold? By Realisation, all the reins come into your hands. Absolutely. You get them into your hands and you can use them if you want. Try it. It’s very easy to try sometimes.
How you can control sound and how you can control elements? It’s very easy to control them. Now see this, fire, you can control this fire also. It also acts all the time. It’s there. Just it is acting all the time when I’m talking to you. And it’s working out. And it catches hold of all the spirits that are around, and just attracts them towards itself and then burns them out. It’s happening. You don’t know, but it’s happening there. It works out this way. Without your knowledge, it is being done.

So because the reins are in one hand, so they are working it out. I don’t have to do anything. They know their jobs. Once they are with me, they get enlightened. They go on to their reins and they start working, because I’m controlling supposing the rain and they get in touch with their reins. So it starts working like that. It’s that simple, but it is so fantastic, that one cannot believe it.

But as you have seen Kundalini rising, you have seen vibrations coming. You have seen people emitting vibrations. You have seen diseases being cured. Some of you have seen cancer being cured. So, gradually, you must know that all these things can happen to you, all of you. It can happen to you, and you can work it out.

So, the powers are tremendous, no doubt, but actually the so-called power of yours becomes zero. Because the powers of God start flowing through you, then what is your power? This simple little ‘ego’ power? It goes away. Not only, but it troubles you if it is there, it gives you a headache. So, it’s better not to have.
[Laughter]
Yes.

So, what other music are you going to? Hum? Who else sings? You sing? Does she? No, yes. Sure.
I think, a little bit this way. Who else is going to sing to Me?
Sahaja Yogini: I don’t sing Christmas choirs, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Well if you might. I would love to hear that. It’s beautiful.
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Ah. All of you know? Which one?
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: I mean, commonly one. Hark the angels?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: All right.
'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing'. Let’s have that one.

Patricia, can you play that?
Patricia: [Unclear].
Shri Mataji: Just try. Try.
Patricia: I can give it a try.
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, you can, you try everything, it will work out. I can tell you.
[Laughter]
You played very well, Patricia. I can’t believe that you have forgotten playing. It’s beautiful what you have done; very clear, very clear. Every note was very clear, beautiful it was. And you kept the rhythm all right, and it’s beautiful.
May God bless you. I’m so happy.
And now you are going to increase your ability to do that. She is a very great genius, you know. She knew this very well. She lost it, but she’s got back again, I think. So thank you very much and let’s have it now, come along.

Patricia: Some carols?
Shri Mataji: Yes, some carols, let’s play. This is the time, you know, it’s the Christmas time.

What is that? Is that?
