The difference between you and this one is is that he does not know it is carried.

This is also a bit. But it is not. Who does not know it is carried my voice, but you know you are carrying the d. And that is how you enjoy it because you're aware of it. You see the thing and you enjoy it. You just gonna be, John. You So what is OK. What about breakfast and all that? You never had anything or you had some lunch in about one hour. There are some people who just come. Would you like some cleaning. Did you have something to eat in the morning?

Did have who do not have to won't have something, all right. Yeah. Anyone will be starting for the weekend. a lot. Any others. OK. He outside behind the garage. great. Uh, Who are the people who are. No.

He's one of mine. He's not. No. From No, no, no, you have so many things. They are not only your heart. There are so many things, you see. You're much more than that. Everything, of course surrounds heart, but heart is a very big thing, you know. What we think of heart is a very, very limited stuff. It is a very big thing, it's no doubt is in the heart, no doubt, but it has to throw lights on something else, is it?

You must express your sincerity in your life. I mean, if it is just there hanging in there, then what's the use? It has to work on something. It has to reflect on something. It has to show its results, so you must have a reflector. Of that type. Yes, in action in behaviour and everything. Oh. Yeah. Take it from the book if you want to.

All right, yes. Some music amongst the jos you see, that's one side where we in London is our music party. We don't sing and we don't have music is very important because that carries the vibrations much better, you see, and uh I think we should somehow compose some poems and put them into tunes and uh. Patricia can compose it and you can really have some nice music, uh. Play and music is very good, you see, uh. I would uh. To say sounds. Sound is one of the carriers of vibrations. Our music is organised sound. organised for evolution.

And the confusion about organised and disorganised is so complete. That we don't understand the thing that is organised. Works out for our creation and for ours. Construction can be disorganised and can work out the way down. Because of this confusion. You should be don't understand. Different things, it's Like the other day as I was telling you that somebody asked me what is the difference between a prostitute and a housewife. I mean something like asking what is the difference between the fire that burns the house and the fire that is lit in the hearth where you cook. So it is so confused, you see, this is the time of confusion. Modernization means confusion, I think, because we are confused about everything.

All of our values are confused. All of our fundamental things are confused and simple things we do not understand, you see, it's become really a confused stuff, but, uh, to overcome confusion, first of all, we must see the different things. Then they integrate them properly. That's the only way we can uh bring forth the chaotic conditions under control and can have some integrated things. So there is a difference between integration and confusion. People confuse integration with confusion. So you have to integrate. All these 7 chakras and there are 7. Qualities within you but not to confuse. And this confusion can be overcome only through vibrations, otherwise you cannot overcome it, because first of all, you have to have something absolute to take out your confusion.

If you do not have something absolute, then you are confused. Somebody said, what, what is there to, uh, have children and not to beat them? No, what is there's a confusion. What's wrong in this and what's wrong in that is all out of confusion. You ask such questions. If you can feel the vibrations, if you can have a report with the absolute, then you can understand that this is absolute and this is a relative. And relative is not to be confused with absolute. That's how confusion can be over. And it is inevitable. Confusion is inevitable when there is at random growth, you see this side more and that side less and this side more and that side less.

So confusion is the only outcome of such a growth, you see, which is at random without any idea of the whole, see. It is malignant. It grows on itself and then it is killing others. And that's how the confusion starts. So the complete integration has to come in. All these powers say sound power now, as I said, there is power of light. And there is power of water and there is power of this earth. And there is power of air for a moment. All these powers are to be. Brought into integration.

Together, how do you get it? How do you do it by Holding their reins into your hands. Now how do you hold their reins? The reins are the things that go absolutely in the centre of it, you see, like a rib inside or you can say like the spinal cord inside. So you catch all of those reins in your hands, and that's how you remove the confusion. And this is the best way you can do it. How do you hold the reins again? The question comes in. How do you hold? By realisation, all the reins come into your hands.

Absolutely. You get them into your hands and you can use them if you want. Try it. It's very easy to try sometimes. Uh, how you can control sound and how you can control, uh, elements. It's very easy to control them. Now see this, uh, fire, you can control this fire also. It also acts all the time. It's there just it's acting all the time when I'm talking to you. And it's working out, uh, and it catches hold of all the spirits that are around and just attracts them towards itself and then burns them out.

It's happening. You don't know, but it's happening there. It works out this way. Without your knowledge, it is being done. So because the reins are in one hand, so they're working it out. I don't have to do anything. They know their jobs. Once they are with me, they get enlightened. They go on to their reins and they start working because I'm controlling supposing the rain and they get in touch with their reins. So it starts working like that.

It's that simple, but it is so fantastic that one cannot believe it. But as you have seen Pundalini rising, you have seen vibrations coming. You have seen people emitting vibrations. You have seen diseases being cured. Some of you have seen cancer being cured. So gradually you must know that all these things can happen to you, all of you. It can happen to you, and you can work it out. So the powers are tremendous, no doubt, but actually the so-called power of yours becomes zero. Because the powers of God start flowing through you, then what is your power, this simple little ego power, it goes away. Not only but it troubles you if it is there, it gives you a headache.

So it's better not to have. Yeah. So what other music are you going to? Huh, who else sings, you sing? Does she, no, yeah. Sure. I think a little bit they say. Who else is going to sing to me? Well if you must, I would love to hear that. It's, uh, all of you know which one?

I mean, commonly one. Hug the angel. All right, let's see hug the uh Haral angel see. Let's have that one. Patricia, can you play that? No Just start right, yeah, yes, yes, you can, you try everything will work out. I can tell you this. You played very well, Patricia. I can't believe that you have forgotten playing. It's beautiful.

You have done very, very clear. Every note was very clear, beautiful it was, and you kept the rhythm all right, and it's beautiful. May God bless you. I'm so happy. And now you are going to increase your ability to do that. She is a very great genius, you know. She knew this very well. She lost it, but she's got back again, I think. So thank you very much and let's have it now, Kala. Yeah, some colours, that's me.

This is the time, you know, it's the Christmas time. Jesus is to be reborn here in the Aya for all of you. And that's what we have to do is to make a proper place for him to be reborn. Uh He had no proper place where he was born. But He does not care for what kind of material. Place it was. But he does care for. Spiritual Atmosphere within yourself. And he can be reborn within all of us. And that is very important.

Because he is the support of Suha. Of this universe. without him. Nothing is possible. People have just done no justice to him. I mean, they have really recrucified him every time. They started a new cult. Oh, let's have the other one. OK. Any other what? Mhm.

Mhm. Yeah Oh But Hm, what's that? Which one? Which one? All right. So, which one is this one? No, you, you just start. Tell her, you tell her, feel accompany. Mhm However you will see. I think that.

Does she know how to play? Oh. You come along here. What It would be all right, Peggy, you needed it. Lots of bottling up is there has to come up, right. Mm. So after I got this. I see. we could all see it is a dam. Then everybody can take, that's that and you.

You know that tune. You want to play the tune on the piano. You cannot work. Hm. I Which one is this? we have some good ones. I mean, it's the one that Modi was trying to teach us in the train from Ahaba. No, no, they call the ances with you in this, yeah, uncle. Oh, but yeah just this girl mm. We have it written down.

No, no, no, no, I have to make it up. Yeah The tune, the tune is very simple. I mean, I think it, you can tell first of all, Patricia, so that. Yeah I was, I don't know, vibrations. You should tell me otherwise. June wise, was that all right? Did he not. This is Modi. Modi is a teacher. He doesn't know how to say it.

Uh huh. Yeah, now let's, I, I could do it go on. They let her take the note. Logan. But Yeah. Uh, it is not so slow, you see, it has to be in the same rhythm, so the second part becomes slower. That's why. Oh. Yeah day. All right, and now to explain.

Oh Yeah. Now You Ah. OK, what is it? What is it? What is it? I don't know. What are you singing? What, what, which one are you singing now? Which one? Yeah, clearly, no, I have to sing to myself.

That's a bit too much. It's a big deal. Come. Let her have the book. You see, they can do that now, mm.
