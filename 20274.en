b'\n1993-1129 Public\nProgram, Paise Ka Mul Nahin [There is no\nvalue for money], Gurgaon, India\n\nI feel so overwhelmed. You have decorated so beautifully.\nYou have done such a lot of work. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much money you may have spent\n\xe2\x80\x93 A Mother gets only such thoughts. And I think, within one year how so much of\nchange has come about in Gurgaon? And people got awakened that we should attain\nthe truth. Everyone wants to attain the truth. Everyone thinks that we should\nattain truth. Because without the truth, there is no meaning of this life. In\nthe darkness whatever we search or see, in that we go into illusions. This is\nthe specialty of Kaliyug. In Kaliyug people go into illusion. They are unable\nto have faith in anything. Because weird people, taking the name of God, talk\nof great things, talk of spirituality and put people in wrong belief. \n\nSo what is the truth? How do we know the truth? But those\nwho are searching, they get hurt. Those who are searching from their heart,\nhaving a lot of faith, they get entangled in wrong path.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I said that in Haryana we should definitely\nstart. Because people here are simple. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that here also they\nmust\xe2\x80\x99ve got entangled with gurus. Where there is simplicity, there gurus\ndefinitely go. They are not gurus, they are agurus [false gurus]. Some of them are bad rakshasas. They call themselves\ngurus and do all such work that they take as much as possible from you and\nspoil your Kundalini. Your get completely lost. You cannot even understand what\nis wrong and what is right.\n\nThere was one person, by saying some mantras, he used to\ngive diamond, pearl etc., sometimes gold chains to people. Now people believed\nthat probably they will also get diamond chain or get something that is very\nprecious. People used get strayed, keep their photos in the house, do a lot of\nthings regarding them. But all this miracles was done by cheating you, which we\ncall mesmerism. Like that he used to mesmerize people. After mesmerizing them, whatever\npeople see, they don\xe2\x80\x99t really see, whatever they are supposed to understand,\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. After that he used to give whoever he wanted to,\nwhatever he wanted to give. To very rich people he used to give diamond, emerald,\netc. etc.\n\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou people should think if they can give like that,\nthen let them make our country prosperous\xe2\x80\x9d. Or you should also think that why\nare they giving it to you, you have everything, they should give it to your\ndriver. But these words were not heeded by anyone. In the end there was a very\nbig program where they put 4 cameras. One on top and one lower. Now camera\ncannot be mesmerized. People can be mesmerized but the camera clicked the\nphotos. Everything was recorded and everywhere it was printed, \xe2\x80\x98who is this maharaj?\nAnd how he is doing tricks and mesmerizing people\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nLike this many types of people cheat in many ways. When they\nhave accumulated enough wealth, they open a University or build something else,\nstart a school for kids. Build something or the other and people get carried\naway.\n\nAmong all these things, you should remember one thing,\nalways, as a Mother I am telling you \xe2\x80\x93 you should see what did you get from\nthis? What did you achieve from this? Whatever was gained was by the gurus. But\nwhat did you achieve? Many people are there. Some say, \xe2\x80\x98they got peace\xe2\x80\x99, some\nsay \xe2\x80\x98they got comfort\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 nothing like that.\n\nPeople will be in such false hood. In reality you should get\nthe Power. In you the Power should be awakened. And the dormant Power within\nyou should be awakened and start working. It should work for you. \n\nWhatever you had, those things disappeared and you did not\nachieve anything. And whatever you got was insignificant. You can get that in\nthe market. For that what is the need to do service of such gurus, keep their\nphoto and put \xe2\x80\x98bindi\xe2\x80\x99 [round red color mark on the forehead]?\nThey don\xe2\x80\x99t have any value.\n\nPeople get carried away in false hood and the reason for\nthat is Kaliyuga. In Kaliyuga many such people have taken birth, who in the name\nof God and in the name of dharma [righteousness],\nthey make up different stories and say that they are doing great work.\n\nHere they have told you how the chakras are placed within\nus. What is their state? How Kundalini is awakened and how our chakras are\ninfluenced by it. And other than that how light comes in them. Our attention\nbecomes enlightened and in that we see what all wrong we are doing. We become\nour own guru and we start seeing ourselves and our movements. We understand\neverything that we were doing this and it is taking us to our destruction, it\nwill destroy us.\n\nThis we understand ourselves because of Kundalini awakening the\nLight of your Spirit comes in your attention. With that you are able to see. Now\nall of you are sitting here and if there is no light and if there is darkness,\nthen you will not come to know each other also. When you walk you will bump\ninto this person, bump into that person. Or you may start fighting. Or may\ntrample a child. \n\nHuman being is lost in darkness of ignorance in this Kaliyug.\nThe main reason of losing it is that till now whatever method was followed, some\npeople came up and started doing everything according to them and the same came\nto us, was imbibed by us in our culture.\n\nNow everyone says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so during our time, now we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how this is happening?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn our time these things were not there\xe2\x80\x9d,\nbecause during that time the things that were told, people had fear of God.\nThey had not achieved the truth but they feared God. They used to think our\nforefathers have told that \xe2\x80\x98such a thing is wrong, it is a sin so we should not\ndo it\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nNow that fear went away because now people are questioning\nwhether God is there or not. Do we trust in God or not? And in place of God\nsuch agurus [false gurus] have come. Such bad people, don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nSo because of their tampering the entire atmosphere changed, we also changed.\nSuch wrong thing started happening that should not have happened.\n\nHuman beings are mostly restricted to themselves. In their own\nselfishness think about themselves and he does not look towards the God. Because\nwhen you go to the Temple, go to Church, go to Mosque, wherever you go its only\nmoney. Nothing happens without money. No one understands that you need not pay\nin Sahaja Yoga, no one understands.\n\nNow such beautiful flowers are here. We have purchased them,\nalright by paying the gardener. But did you pay Mother Earth any money? The One\nWho has done the work, you did not give any money. Because She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand money. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what money is. She has no value for the\nmoney- that money is something big and She needs to get it. She is happy that\n\xe2\x80\x98In Me there is Power because of which I can transform a seed into a beautiful tree.\nSo why not do it?\xe2\x80\x99 This action of transformation according to Her is the gift\nof wealth.\n\nIn the same way you will find that Sahaja Yoga is a living\nprocess, living process. How does it happen? Someone will ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you sow a\nseed, how does the plant grow from that?\xe2\x80\x9d There is no answer. In the seed there\nis something and in the Earth also there is something, cause of which this\ntakes place. All these bindings have been made by God since the beginning. That\nis the reason the nature does so much of such work that we cannot understand.\nLike a flower plant will grow only to a certain height. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a mango tree it\nwill grow only to a fixed height. Apples don\xe2\x80\x99t grow on mango tree. The Power\nwhich sets these boundaries is called as Paramachaitanya. That many people..\n\nToday is Nanak Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s Centenary. I bow to Him and tell you.\nHe told so many times that this is a living process. Why do you go to the\njungle? Where do you go? Achieve the God who is sitting in your heart. He\nhimself said, \xe2\x80\x9cSahaja Samadhi lao\xe2\x80\x9d. Samadhi meaning the way our awareness is it\nis Sahaja \xe2\x80\x93 simple. It does not mean do that, do this. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do\nanything, it happens by itself. And today is a great day. It is said this place\nwas called \xe2\x80\x98Gurugram\xe2\x80\x99 and we had to come here on Nanak Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s Centenary. It is\na very big coincidence.\n\nNow the gurus have come to such a state - where were they [earlier Gurus] and where are these\npeople [gurus nowadays]? You should\nuse your mind and think the people who gave away Jesus Christ for money. Had he\naccumulated any wealth? These people accumulate wealth. They make a big castle\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all business they do? This business of accumulating money,\nno Godly person will do that \xe2\x80\x93 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Like how the Mother Earth\nis \xe2\x80\x93 He has a large heart and only knows how to give. \n\nIf you understand this way, because they told Me last year that\nmany people had gurus who were very influential. Whatever advertisements we had\nput up, they tore them up. Even the photographs that were put up, everything\nwere torn. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cIts alright, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see next year\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nNow you need to open your eyes. Kabir Dasji has said, \xe2\x80\x9cKaise\nsamajhaon, sab jagah andha?\xe2\x80\x9d [how can I\nmake them understand, they are all blind?]. Saying that he lost and gave\nup. All of them lost. That time the situation was not that they understood all\nthis - that first the truth must be attained. There were few people at that\ntime. Very few people and their state was such that like Namdev from\nMaharashtra and one thing significant was that even His servant, she was also a\nsaint. He then came to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib recognized Him. Because only\nthose who have achieved something can only recognize. Those who have received God\xe2\x80\x99s\nblessings, those who are Self Realized, only they can recognize another Self Realized.\n\nNamdev once went to a village. There was one potter; while\ncoming here I saw many potters so I remembered him - a person named Gora potter\nwas there. He was also a saint. So when He [Namdev] saw Him standing there, He\nwent and saw that He was breaking the clay with His feet. As soon as He\n[Namdev] saw Him, Namdev stood astonished. Standing there he said in Marathi,\n\xe2\x80\x9cNirguna cha beti alo saguna\xe2\x80\x9d. Meaning I had come to see the Nirgun [Formless] \xe2\x80\x93 to see the light spread all\nover, to see the Chaitanya, but He is standing in person [Form] here. That kind of recognition \xe2\x80\x93 only a saint can recognize a\nsaint. One who is non saintly cannot recognize. Saying such a big thing to\nsomeone that I am seeing everything in person. This He said and you can see how\nNanak Saab made Him [Namdev] stay with Him [Nanak Saab] with a lot of respect.\n\nThen He learnt Punjabi and there is such a big book He has\nwritten in Punjabi. Namdev, Namdev was from Maharashtra but He wrote such a big\nbook and described what \xe2\x80\x98Nirakaar\xe2\x80\x99 [Formless]\nis.\n\nAt that time Nanak Saab told Him don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of \xe2\x80\x98Sakaar\xe2\x80\x99 [Form], speak of \xe2\x80\x98Nirakaar\xe2\x80\x99 [Formless]. Because once you talk about \xe2\x80\x98Sakaar\xe2\x80\x99\n[Form] then people go on doing puja\nof idols and this and that. Even He didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of \xe2\x80\x98Sakaar\xe2\x80\x99 [Form].\n\nIf you talk about flowers \xe2\x80\x93 people get stuck with flowers.\nThen don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of flowers, talk of honey \xe2\x80\x93 you have to attain honey. When they\ntalk of honey, they get stuck with honey. You should have sweetness, by which\nyou reach the essence of honey. Everyone has told this. I am not telling you\nsomething new. There were Tukaram, Ramdas, Adi Shankaracharya or whoever who\nwere great saints. In the 12th Century even Gyaneshwarji, He also\ntold that without Self Realization you cannot achieve the knowledge. Even in Gita,\nthey told that you first obtain the knowledge.\n\nNow when they said, \xe2\x80\x98get the knowledge\xe2\x80\x99 people started\nreading and writing. Reading and writing [studies]\nanyone can do. By that one does not become knowledgeable.\n\nSometimes I have seen that those people who are learned are\nso egoistical, so aggressive and think highly of themselves. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Kabir\nDasji said, \xe2\x80\x9cPadhi padhi pandita murakh whai\xe2\x80\x9d [reading and reading, the learned became fools]. After studying,\nthey start feeling that \xe2\x80\x98we are great learned\xe2\x80\x99. Like \xe2\x80\x98we have written the Gita\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x98we know all about Ramayan\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98we know Koran\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nIn that like how a person gets intoxicated, the person can\xe2\x80\x99t\neven see, \xe2\x80\x98what I am thinking is knowledge \xe2\x80\x93 is not real knowledge\xe2\x80\x99. Because\nknowledge is such that we come to know on our nerves. We should get the\nknowledge on our central nervous system.\n\nLike there is a difference between human being and animals \xe2\x80\x93\nmany things human beings know, but the animals don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He comes to know\nthrough his central nervous system. He knows through the nerves on his hands\n\n[palm]\n\n. This is knowledge, this is awakening. This word even Budha used \xe2\x80\x93 bodh.\nBodh meaning that within us, how our body is made of. Like this is our head and\nthe brain is in it and other things, in all that you should have the knowledge.\n\nNow you are sitting here, the lights are on. Now all of you\nare seeing and all of you know that the lights are on. No one can doubt this\nbecause you are seeing it with your eyes. It comes from our central nervous\nsystem. In the same way knowledge is something you feel within yourself. It is\nnot through your intelligence. Not through your emotions. \xe2\x80\x98I am all the time\ndevoted to God. I only keep singing devotional songs\xe2\x80\x99 etc. etc. There is no\nmeaning to all this. All this is a drama.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why as a Mother I tell you, \xe2\x80\x98stay away from drama\xe2\x80\x99.\nTo achieve the truth most important thing is that you first know yourself that\nwhy you came on Earth? Science can give the answer to a lot of things \xe2\x80\x93 people\nthink like that \xe2\x80\x93 its wrong. It cannot answer a lot of things. Most importantly\nit cannot answer, \xe2\x80\x98why you have come on this Earth?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98what is the meaning of\nyou being here?\xe2\x80\x99 In this we should pay attention and see what have we\nunderstood about ourselves. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t understood.\n\nWe say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are intelligent, our brains think\xe2\x80\x9d. Or we say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis ours. This is my eyes, my hand\xe2\x80\x99. But who is this \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99? That we have not\nunderstood \xe2\x80\x93 who is this \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99? Knowing this is Self-Realization. To know that\nyou cannot do it through your brain. \xe2\x80\x98It can be understood through your brains\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x93 it is not so. You should feel it in your nervous system. That which you can\nunderstand this way [through your nervous system], in the real knowledge. This\nwas told by Krishna to Arjun first. When Arjun asked a question, then He said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright, you do your duty and leave everything to God\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 it is not possible.\n\nKrishna, you can say was Diplomatic. He said that human\nbrains are upside-down. By telling them simple things, nothing will enter their\nbrains. So He twisted it and told, \xe2\x80\x9cYou surrender all your work to God\xe2\x80\x9d. So now\nif there is a murderer also then He\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes I have surrendered to\nKrishna\xe2\x80\x9d. Someone does something bad and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have surrendered to Krishna\xe2\x80\x9d.\nKrishna knew that these people will understand that there is something in it. It\nis only possible when you become Self-Realized. When you become Self-Realized\nthen it does not occur to you that I am doing this or doing that. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nhappening, everything is happening by itself.\n\nIf a Sahaja Yogi is raising someone\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini and I ask what\nis happening? \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not raising, It is not coming down. It is not happening\nfor this person\xe2\x80\x9d. He will not say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not doing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 will not talk like that.\nThis is a big question that is happens by itself and human becomes effortless.\nIts just that Sahaja Yoga is your own. \xe2\x80\x98Sa\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x98with you\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Ja\xe2\x80\x99 meaning\nborn. This is your right. It is your right that you receive it.\n\nIn Urdu many people call dharma as \xe2\x80\x98haq\xe2\x80\x99. It means dharma is\nyour \xe2\x80\x98haq\xe2\x80\x99 [right] \xe2\x80\x93 to attain\ndharma. Not talk of dharma. They may be a Christian, a Muslim, a Sikh or any\nreligion \xe2\x80\x93 a Hindu, all talk a lot of dharma. But all bad things, anyone can\ndo. Its not that if a person is Hindu, he can\xe2\x80\x99t do it or if he is a Muslim he\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do it \xe2\x80\x93 everyone can do bad things. It means that there is no dharma in\nthat. Just by belonging to a religion people don\xe2\x80\x99t become dharmic. Dharma\nshould be awakened from within, this is the only Dharma and it is your right.\nAwakening Dharma within you is your right. Once this is awakened \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nrefuse anyone from doing anything.\n\nLike you understand, once you awaken your Kundalini, then in\nthat light you will set yourself right \xe2\x80\x93 no need to tell anything. Whatever is\nwrong automatically drops off and the good things remain. So many blessings you\nget. Many people used to write to Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother this miracle happened with us,\nthat miracle happened\xe2\x80\x9d, so on and so forth we got a lot of letters. I told\nsomeone, \xe2\x80\x9cYou take these letters and whatever feel, you tell more people to\nwrite about the miracles that happened to them\xe2\x80\x9d. In one month he called Me,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother the letters have reached this high [Mother\nraising both Her hands]. Now you tell Me in this which should we print?\xe2\x80\x9d I\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time, whichever you think is good you print\xe2\x80\x9d. He\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of them is fantastic\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhat you call miracle like that many miracles can happen in\nyour life. Those miracles are such that no one can explain how it happened,\nwhat happened. Later we understand that we have entered the Kingdom of God. And\nthe Kingdom of God is not like Government of India, not even England\nGovernment. Kingdom of God is very effective. The minute you think of something,\nimmediately it is attended to. It is amazing. The court of Paramachaitanya is such\nthat it is made in such a way that anyone says anything and it takes place.\nSlowly, slowly everything happens that you will say that we had never even thought\nit will happen like this, how did it happen?\n\nAll these things I am telling you, you should not believe\nMe. Because then it will be blind faith. There\xe2\x80\x99s no room for blind faith. I am\ntelling you all this so that you understand what you need to achieve. That\nthing is your own and your right that you be in the Kingdom of God. You be under\nHis ruling. You become its citizen, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll see how you are taken care of.\nFor this to happen its important that first your Kundalini should be awakened.\n\nSo what is the truth is that you are not all this body, mind,\nsoul etc., but you yourself are the pure Spirit. This is the truth. Till now\nwhat you were saying as \xe2\x80\x98mine\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98mine\xe2\x80\x99 will become \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99. The other truth is that\nthe God\xe2\x80\x99s Powers that is spread all over which is the Paramachaitanya which\ndoes the living work. That same Power, when our relation is built with That,\nwhen we achieve It, It flows through us all the time and like how this\nconnection is there [pointing to the mike],\nsimilar connection Kundalini will make with the Paramachaitanya.\n\nNow if you try to understand this with your intellect and\nthink, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it possible? Mother, people have told the awakening of Kundalini\nis very difficult\xe2\x80\x9d. Then some say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, from Kundalini awakening lot of\nheat is generated.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing like that happens. This has not happened till now.\nIt is just that we are Sahaji and Kundalini awakens. If the Kundalini awakens,\nthere has to be some specialty. If It awakens then there is some specialty and\nyou have been born in such a time.\n\nThis is special blooming time which we call as blossom time.\nDuring this time such people have taken birth that they are very eager to know\nGod. Very enthusiastically, very diligently, they desire \xe2\x80\x98we should achieve Truth\xe2\x80\x99.\nBut they get trapped in false hood because this is Kaliyug. They got lost in\nthe darkness of Kaliyug. No matter what happens if they are seekers, then it is\ntheir right that they achieve it and they should get it.\n\nFor this how much money can you pay? To Earth you give money,\nyou give anything, does She understand? Does She have that sense? What money\nwill you give Her? And for this work how much effort will you put? If\neverything is built within you, everything is ready within you - like: just\nunderstand this candle is already made and if you have to light it what effort\nyou need to put? Get a lighted candle near it, it will light up. It is very\nstraight forward. There is no give and take in this. The most important thing\nis that one should love everyone. No one talks of love. Just pure love, pure\nlove. This pure love is so sweet in you, it does such tricks that you will be surprised\nthat what miracle has taken place in Sahaja Yoga. There is no working of your\nmind. Its beyond your mind, beyond your psyche, it is a state.\n\nIn this two states are achieved. First state is that which\nwe call as \xe2\x80\x98nirvichar samadhi\xe2\x80\x99 [thoughtless\nawareness]. In that state, in the state of thoughtless awareness \xe2\x80\x93 you\nbecome thoughtless. One thought rises and stops, second thought rises and\nstops. We are either in the past or future. Whatever has happened in the past,\nwe think of that or we think of future. We keep going back and forth. But we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think that this time i.e. the present, are not able to stay there. In\nthis time we are unable to stay. We are not able to be in the present.\n\nBecause of Kundalini awakening this thought which rises and\nfalls and again raises and falls, they become separate. And the place in-between\nthese thoughts called as \xe2\x80\x98vilamb\xe2\x80\x99[gap],\nthere your attention stays. There is no thought. But you are completely aware\nand attentive. Like this you attain \xe2\x80\x98Nirvichar Samadhi\xe2\x80\x99 [thoughtless\nawareness]. Samadhi meaning - \xe2\x80\x98dhi\xe2\x80\x99 comes from \xe2\x80\x98budhi\xe2\x80\x99 [mind], \xe2\x80\x98sama\xe2\x80\x99 meaning joined [one\nwith]. It is state beyond thought. But\nunderstand mind becomes one. Your awareness becomes one.\n\nSo first \xe2\x80\x98Nirvichar Samadhi\xe2\x80\x99 is attained. After that, after\nthoughtless awareness, you attain doubtless awareness. For many both take place\nat the same time.\n\nIn \xe2\x80\x98Nirvikalpa\xe2\x80\x99 [doubtless], there is no doubt. When you use\nthis Power, you will be surprised that the Kundalini of people are awakened by\nyour hands. Now are able to cure people, you can feel others chakras. Because\nyou are awakened in collective consciousness, there is no other. You become the\npart and parcel of one body. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you are feeling, you are understanding\nthe problems of others, you feel on your fingers. When you work in that\ncollective consciousness, when you are collectively conscious then you attain\nthe other state which is called \xe2\x80\x98Nirvikalpa Samadhi\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x98Nirvikalpa\xe2\x80\x99 meaning\nwhere no doubt remains. Then you understand that you have achieve the truth. \n\nTo tell this it feels extraordinary. First people don\xe2\x80\x99t say\nsuch things, tell such things. Your awareness is transformed or you get a new\ndimension that you become collective and know everyone, understand everyone.\nYou know about everyone\xe2\x80\x99s chakras. You may not say but you will understand.\nJust understand because of these chakras whatever is bad, whatever is wrong within\nus, all that is because of these chakras. \n\nPhysical, psychological, materialistic and worldly things whatever\nis there, other than that spiritual, whatever is wrong is because of problems\nin these chakras. Once we learn to set right the chakras and learn about them,\nwe can become alright and we can also set right the chakras of other people.\nAll these Powers are within you, is placed. You just have to achieve them.\n\nJust one thing is important that for this transformation, you\nhave to have a pure desire from within. All other desires which are fulfilled\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t give satisfaction. This is the pure desire that we should be connected to\nthe Paramchaitanya. If you have this pure desire in you then this work will\ntake place easily. And the other thing you need to understand is that you\nshould be devoted to yourself. You should have faith in yourself.\n\nWe are humans. Above all animals, above everything. These\nare flowers alright, they are fragrant but we are above them. We are humans. If\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t respect ourselves, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand ourselves, think ourselves\nto be sinners always. This is a different way, \xe2\x80\x98you are sinners, give this much\nmoney, your sins can be washed away\xe2\x80\x99. Many people do such wrong things. All\nthis is very wrong. Or \xe2\x80\x98do fasting\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98do this rituals\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98do those rituals\xe2\x80\x99.\nThey drive women so crazy so that I see and get surprised that why women listen\nto them. It should be understood that, first you understand that you are human\nbeings. And within all of you there is Kundalini and She can be awakened. She\nis your Mother. She is the individual Mother of each one of you. She knows\neverything about you and She is eager to give you rebirth.\n\nIts not because I am saying so, it is the truth. You first\nrespect yourself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of yourself as any sinner or sorrowful or wrong\ndoer. It is very necessary to say that whatever is created in this world, above\neverything is the human and Indian are even higher. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, this\nis a holy place. This is a sacred land, lot of auspicious deeds have been done\nhere, many good deeds. After going out I understand that such holy people live\nhere that they already know about sin and holiness. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that\nhow fortunate we are and because of this holiness how we will be benefited. So\nmany holy people have come today to achieve the Yoga. So don\xe2\x80\x99t have any\nthoughts about yourself, like having doubts, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I achieve, I have done\nthis, I have don\xe2\x80\x99t that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFirst of all you need to understand that this\nParamachaitanya is the ocean of forgiveness. First of all. And you cannot\ncommit any such mistakes that it cannot be forgiven. It wants that all of you\nachieve the Paramachaitanya and whatever has been told till now \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98you should\nbe reborn\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98you should get your Realization\xe2\x80\x99. This is the special time to\nfulfil all that and at this time you are born in India. It is a very big thing.\nUnderstand this and know that you completely deserve the awakening of your\nKundalini.\n\nStill there is one more thing that I will tell you that when\nyou come in Sahaja Yoga, like how the seed sprouts and even when the plant\ngrows, still you have to nourish it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it should not happen that you\npeople come to listen to My lecture get your Realization and you will feel that\nyou are swimming in joy, you will feel like that and then the Kundalini will\nwork on each and every chakra of yours. It is necessary for you that there are\ncentres here. Good thing that best people are running the centres here and they\nare helping. So you should go to such centres because this work is collective\nwork. The work of collective awareness is collective. If you talk of the entire\nUniverse then, then all Sahaja Yogis are part and parcel of the same body. If anyone\nis in problem then all countries will come to know about it. If anyone\nexperiences some problem, everyone will rush \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98how do we help them?\xe2\x80\x99 every\ntime. Such relationship, such love you don\xe2\x80\x99t get to see anywhere.\n\nI saw that when I went to Russia, there some 7-8 thousand\npeople came. In many countries \xe2\x80\x93 those who don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the language \xe2\x80\x93 such\nlove, such lovely talks. Looking at that a Mothers heart is very enamored. How\nall people had come, no conflict, nothing. Yes there is lot of happiness and\nfun. They are smiling always, having fun, pulling each other legs all that. But\nsuch love, such caring, such togetherness.\n\nThey are all like that in the hangar, nothing, no\nrequirements of any type. Everyone is enjoying. This kind of a [form?] is\nprepared. This [form?] we can say is Sahaja Dharm. You can recognize them\nimmediately, their speech, how they behave, how they speak, everything about\nthem. \n\nI want that all of you who are from Gurgaon, yesterday I\nmade a mistake, I thought I have gone to Gurgaon. They said Gurgaon people are\nvery sweet, many nice people were sitting. So I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is only Gurgaon\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThen I came to know Gurgaon is another place and its name was Gurugram. I said\n\xe2\x80\x98you people are very sweet like guru\xe2\x80\x99, so I told them only, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are from\nGurgaon\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhatever it is, today is very auspicious. On this day these\npeople - saints have given so much of blood, said so many things, talked so\nmuch, worked so hard. But we are unable move on that path because we are not\nyet capable. Because in us we still don\xe2\x80\x99t have the light. In the light you will\nsee that you will float in the ocean of joy. Today Mother just told you, I\nusually don\xe2\x80\x99t tell so in the beginning but don\xe2\x80\x99t know why today because of\nGurunanakji\xe2\x80\x99s centenary; from the heart, whatever He has told, whatever Kabir\nDasji also has told about the future all that will happen and there is no doubt\nin that.\n\nSo all those who want Realization, you are most welcome to\nsit here. But those who don\xe2\x80\x99t want, one should not force them. Because God has\ngiven you your freedom whether you want to go to hell or you want to go to\nheaven, God has left that to you. That\xe2\x80\x99s why no one can force you. Those who\nwant to get their Realization please be seated and those who don\xe2\x80\x99t want please\nleave, it will be a big help. I will definitely tell you that how much ever\nspeech one gives, do anything, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a difference. \n\nAwakening happens so quickly in India that even I Myself am\nsurprised. Outside, My hands starts paining cause of hard work. Need to work on\neach and every one, do that and this. And here you people are worshipers and\nyou achieve so well that I get surprised. Yesterday in Gurugram they said that\n100% all people were awakened. Its amazing. After it takes place it should not\nbe that you are shaky. You should establish yourself. The power to establish is\nless in Indians but more in foreigners. Foreigners establish themselves because\nthey understand that they have got such a thing that they cannot get anywhere.\nThey toil a lot. But for Indians \xe2\x80\x93 today here, then tomorrow one more guru baba\nand so on. They go guru shopping. \n\nFor this you should have a lot of faith, towards one self, faith\ntowards oneself. This is our Self Realization which we have to grow. That\xe2\x80\x99s why\nI tell you again and again have faith towards oneself. With that faith you establish.\nFirst know yourself then others. \n\nNow don\xe2\x80\x99t try to understand Me, it very difficult. First you\nunderstand yourself and with that you establish yourself. Establish that truth\nwithin. Then you will understand what you are. I am telling you, \xe2\x80\x98you are dignified\xe2\x80\x99,\nI will prove it. But later don\xe2\x80\x99t become shaky, but be firm.\n\nIts told that wherever you get some water, you have to dig a\nwell there. What is the use of digging at 10 places? But this is the habit of\nIndians that till they don\xe2\x80\x99t go to ten places, till they don\xe2\x80\x99t get cheated at ten\nplaces, till then they cannot establish. But I wish that first all of you establish\nthen live your life in comfort and joy.\n\nWhat is the benefit of this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to tell\nbut you yourself come to know and tell Me that \xe2\x80\x98Mother we got benefited like\nthis, benefited like that\xe2\x80\x99. This is very joy giving.\n\nThis means all of you want that you should get your\nRealization. Alright. Indians don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do a lot of work, this is a big\nblessing for you people.\n\nKeep your hands like this [Shri Mataji opening both Her palm]. Just keep it like this. Now\nclose your eyes. If you wish you can remove the spectacles also. Because your\neyesight also become alright with this. Close your eyes. \n\n[Shri Mataji blows\nChaitanya]. Now open your eyes. Keep this hand [left] towards Me. And placing this hand on top of your head, right\nhand place it above your head like this; above the fontanel bone area and check\nif cool or hot air is coming out. At first it can be hot also. Move your hand\nand check - right hand, right hand, keep it above not touching. Keep the hand\nslightly above, then you can make out. Hmm\n\nNow place your right hand towards Me and feel with your left\nhand. Bend your head, bend your head. Move it [hand] and feel. For some it can\nbe felt much above the head and for some closer to the head. First bend your\nhead.\n\nNow left hand, place your left hand towards Me. And right\nhand [Shri Mataji moves the right hand\nabove the head]. Now place both your hands towards the sky. Tilt your head\nbackwards and ask the question, \xe2\x80\x9cMother is this Paramachaitanya?\xe2\x80\x9d Ask the\nquestion three times. Ask in your heart, \xe2\x80\x9cMother is this Paramachaitanya?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPlease ask the question, \xe2\x80\x9cMother is this the Paramachaitanya?\xe2\x80\x9d\nthree times. Now bring your hands down. In everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands or fingers or on\nthe fontanel bone area cool or hot, any type of air they are feeling \xe2\x80\x93 all\nthose people, please raise your hands. \n\nAll of you got your Realization, all of you. You got your\nRealization. I bow to all the Realized persons. First you were seekers now you are\nsaints. My salute and many blessings. \n\nI only wish that you take this further and by spreading you\ngrow into a large trees that many other people also are awakened.\n'
