Shri Ganesha Puja. Kalwa (India), 31 December 1991.

Translation from Hindi

Today, first to do the puja of Shri Ganesh then Devi puja, we have assembled here. The belief in Shri Ganesha especially in Maharashtra, is very strong. Because here, Swayambhu [created by Mother Earth] Ashtavinayak [eight Ganeshas] is located. Now people can say that there was nothing like Ganesha. Also they can say that the Swayambhu is not Ashtavinayak. But once you get your Self Realisation, when you get your vibrations, then you can ask, “Is this Swayambhu? Is this really made by Earth?”

Many miracles of Ganesha has taken place in Sahaja Yoga. Especially if you see My photographs, you will be astonished how He has given ‘darshan’ [appeared].

The significance of Ganesha is that He is seated on every chakra. First of all Ganesha was established. Ganesha came in the world to spread chastity. First to make the entire Universe pure. Most important thing is purity. If purity is not there then nothing can be created.

Just supposing there is a tree. Its surroundings become polluted, then the trees will die. In the say way to purify the environment of the entire Universe, Shri Ganesha was established.

These days in this environment, people cannot understand what is chastity? And what is the meaning of chastity? The same Ganesha later on appeared as Isa Masih [Jesus Christ]. That is the reason Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has talked more about the significance of chastity. That even your eyes have to be pure because He is on the Agnya Chakra. Even in the eyes there should be purity. If there is no purity in your eyes, then you will not be considered pure in any way. But it does not mean that you tell yourself that, that this is bad in us, that is bad in us. But if you believe in Shri Ganesh, if we do His puja, then His character, we should imbibe in ourselves.

His first character is chastity. Now how can we achieve this purity? It cannot happen by telling. By telling someone, “You become pure”- it is not possible. Even after bathing in Gangajal (water of the Ganges), one becomes pure – nothing like that. So what should we do to achieve this purity? For this your Kundalini should be first awakened. Once the awakening takes place, then you should understand that slowly She will purify all the chakras.

But there also it is the work of Shri Ganesha. Because this is Chaitanya [vibrations]. In the form of vibrations, Shri Ganesha keeps cleaning every chakra. In the end, in the Sahasrara, you know that Shri Ganesha sits on the lap of Sadashiva.

All these things, we feel are ancient, mythological. The truth of all this can be achieved in Sahaja Yoga. First you have to achieve the truth – absolute truth. After that whatever question you ask, the right answer will be felt on your fingers. You will understand what the truth is.

Just by calling something untrue, it does not become untrue. You should research further. This is a very deep thing. Shri Ganesha’s work is very, very deep. And He is an eternal child. The chastity and innocence in Him, He is an eternal child. He is child-like. Christ has said, “If you have to enter into the kingdom of God, you have to become like children”. It means that the innocent character that is in children should come in us.

But by forcing or daily practice, it does not happen. If you force it, then your ego will increase. If you say, “We are sinners, we have sinned, we are bad”. Then your superego will increase. Both sides are wrong. So what should be done?

What we should do is first awaken our own Kundalini. Because of Kundalini awakening you go to a different dimension. Once you go to a different dimension, slowly, slowly, from within, the purification takes place.

Since ancient times, Kundalini is placed in you. And She is waiting for the time, She is waiting for the time that you meet such a person who can awaken your Kundalini. Because She is your Mother and She is your own individual Mother. She knows everything about you. The way your mother, while giving birth endured all the pain Herself, in the same way Kundalini Herself takes up all the pains and you get your Self Realization.

After getting your Self Realization, you have to do only this much, that the union of yours which has taken place with Parama Chaitanya, that you have to establish.

In all four directions we see, see how beautiful the flowers are! How beautiful the creation is! But we never even think how these are made. Who makes them? One flowering plant will grow only up to a certain height. A tree grows only up to the same height. Who does all this?

About this if you read Pantanjali it is written as ‘Ritumbhara Pragnya’. The name he has given is ‘Ritumbhara Pragnya’. But this is the Brahma Chaitanya. This is the Parama Chaitanya which is spread all over. Which Adi Shankaracharya has called ‘Saleelam Saleelam’ – cool cool breeze, they come in waves. In Bible also it is called ‘Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost’.

This way the Kundalini was settled in us and is waiting – when the rebirth will take place.

Till now we come from amoeba to this state, we have become human beings. But there has to be a higher state than this. Had we achieved the truth, these fights going on these days would not be there. We would all live in one mind, with one truth. All these fights that are happening is because we haven’t achieved that truth. Till the time we achieve the truth, we would not have achieved the zenith of this evolution. Without achieving it we can never live in bliss, peace and satisfaction.

All the questions that are there in you, mostly humans only have raised them. To bring a transformation in a person, lot of work is of Shri Ganesha – He toils a lot. He has Ganas, so he is called Ganapati [head of Ganas]. All the time He is serving His Mother.

Everywhere, wherever it is needed He goes there immediately and does the work. Now all these things feel like they are some heavenly things and there is no relation with the humans. But in this world only we can establish that heaven whose glory has been praised in the Shastras. It is not a difficult task. For this we just have to be armed and have pure desire to achieve it.

These are not lies. These talks are not so as to mesmerize someone. But this is the truth and we have to achieve it. We bow to Shri Ganesh, but we don’t think that who is Shri Ganesha? Where is He established in us? What all work does He does and what should we learn from Him?

One more thing we have to imbibe from Him is ‘subudhi’ which is called as wisdom. Shri Ganesha has so much wisdom and love that He knows that you are doing mistakes. He knows that there is fault within you, but like a small child He forgives each and every thing. He doesn’t know how to be angry on someone. Similarly He forgives you a lot. To an extent He forgives a lot. But when you cross all the limits, then He becomes angry.

Just believing in Him, going to the temple and offering money – He doesn’t understand money. If you want to offer something, offer your heart. And you have to establish Ganesha in your heart. Till the time He doesn’t come in our heart our life will not become pure. And the blessings we have to get as a result of purity, we will not get.

Other than that, He also has the Power that He can kill evil people. If anyone troubles you, he will be around you.

Many miracles have taken place in Sahaja Yoga. People have seen that whatever questions they had were solved. Even that work is of Shri Ganesha. He does the work in such manner that we don’t understand how it was done. No flaw will be left.

When such a powerful Shri Ganesha is with us then what are we scared of? What are we frightened of? We just have to accept Ganesha and establish Him within us. This doesn’t take place by preaching. When you experience it; when the awakening takes place then you will understand the importance of Shri Ganesha.

All the foreigners sitting here have, they had not even heard the ‘Ga’ of Shri Ganesha. They did not even know. But they always worship Shri Ganesha, because by worshing Him they have benefitted a lot.

All of you also, those who have come here today, may you all achieve your Self Realization and Shri Ganesha, whose puja is going to be performed today.

Shri Mataji speaks in English: time – 22:35

I have been telling them about Shri Ganesha. How important it is to worship Shri Ganesha. Now you know through photographs and all that, that It is a living Diety and It is on Mooladhara.

He is actually the Chancellor of all the Universities I would say in the sense that He is sitting on all the chakras. Without Him nothing can work out. Because He is the one who is Holiness.

So wherever the Kundalini goes it is He who pours the holiness and the cleansing Power of Shri Ganesha cleanses your chakras. So it is very important to understand the virtue of Shri Ganesha, how He works within your chakras and how He helps you.

We may worship Him. Just we may sing His praise and all that. But we should also think what qualities we have got from Him of great chastity, great purity, also of wisdom. We have to understand that our wisdom is not something that could not be inculcated. It cannot be something that can be maneuvered. It is something very innate thing and it comes through our maturity.

So this maturity can only come through the proper attention to your Kundalini, fixing up your Kundalini with the All Pervading Power. This has to be done through regular mediation. It’s not a ritual but it should be done whenever you feel like and after sometime you will find that you are all the time meditation. You don’t have to even meditate, but you are in meditation.

His style is so great that it has no words to be described. But only thing I would like to say that He’s a little child. He’s an eternal child and the eternal child would gives Him that innocence of a child. We cannot force ourselves to be innocence. Because we have grown and we have learnt lots of cunning things. But when Kundalini starts rising and She starts blessing our chakras automatically we start thinking our innocence has come back. Now we have got innocent heart, innocent mind and innocent love.

This simple innocent personality is the sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

And then He also knows for definite through his experience that has looked after by the Ganas of Shri Ganesha. Whether you are in Russia or in England or in India.

They are all over and the way they are watching you and the way they guide you and the way they help you. You have these experiences and you know that how many people have written about their experiences that we could not even compile them in a book.

But all these Ganas are there and they are so kind and so nice. But apart from that they are also watching you. They are seeing how, how is your behavior? If you try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga by any chance it may be punished, it may act against you.

I’ve warned you many times not to exploit Sahaja Yoga for your advantage. It is for the advantage of others and not for your advantage.

You already have got your own Realization. But exploitation should not be there at all. On the contrary enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga is the best way to know Sahaja Yoga. So far we’ve had some bad experiences but very very few. Surprisingly, people who had never known even the first word ‘Ga’ of Ganapati, have become such devoted bhaktas [worshipers] of Shri Ganesha and they have understood the importance of innocence and of purity.

I am rather sad today that all the Sahaja Yogis are now going away to their countries. And I wish them that they carry this purity of Shri Ganesha with them, which is very much required in your countries, very much to be spread out. Only you have to desire and it will spread.

I am sure things will change very soon and you will have a much better, much better time. Moreover I am sure also there are many people who think and who are seeking this truth and they are seeking also this purity. So only thing what you have to do is to find out, find out as to which people are those which are just striving to seek the truth. Try to find them out. It’s very easy to find them out. And also after finding out then do not argue with them, just give them Realization.

Let them feel the vibrations and then things would be better. There are many many things which are false in this world. Lots of things are full of falsehood doesn’t, matter. All this falsehood everything can be easily cleared out by the truth - light of the truth.

So today, Shri Ganesha’s temple is here, so we’ll do Shri Ganesha’s worship first and then the Devi’s worship.

I hope you people will say all the Atharvasheesh and everything. May God bless you all. I hope you have enjoyed the tour very much and now you are going with such good vibrations. Carry them to your own countries and give My love to all the Sahaja Yogis who have not come.

May God bless you.

I've been telling them about Shri Ganesha, how important it is to worship Shri Ganesh. Now, you know through photographs and all that - that it's a living deity, and it is on Mooladhara. He is actually the chancellor of all the universities, I would say, in the sense that He is sitting on all the chakras. Without Him, nothing can work out, because He is the one who is holiness. So wherever the Kundalini goes, it is He who pours the holiness and the cleansing power of Shri Ganesha cleanses your chakras.

So it is very important to understand the virtue of Shri Ganesha, how He works within your chakras and how He helps you. We may worship Him; just we may sing His praise and all that, but we should also think what qualities we have got from Him of great chastity, great purity, also of wisdom. We have to understand that our wisdom is not something that could be inculcated. It cannot be something that can be maneuvered. It is something very innate thing and it comes through our maturity.

So this maturity can only come through the proper attention to your Kundalini, to fixing up your Kundalini with the all-pervading power. This has to be done through regular meditation. It's not a ritual, but it should be done whenever you feel like, and after sometime you'll find that you are all the time in meditation. You don't have to even meditate, but you are in meditation.

His style is so great that it has no words to be described. But only thing I would like to say that He is a little child. He is an eternal child and the eternal childhood gives Him that innocence of a child. We cannot force ourselves to be innocent because we have grown and we have learned lots of cunning things. But when the Kundalini starts rising and She starts blessing our chakras, automatically we start thinking our innocence has come back. Now we have got innocent heart, innocent mind and innocent love. This simple innocent personality is the sign of a good Sahaja Yogi. And then he also knows, for definite through his experience, that he's looked after by the ganas of Shri Ganesha. Whether you are in Russia or in England or in India, they're all over and the way they are watching you and the way they guide you and the way they help you, you have these experiences and you know that how many people have written about their experiences that we could not even compile them in a book.

But all these ganas are there and they are so kind and so nice, but apart from that, they are also watching you. They're seeing how is your behavior. If you try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga by any chance, it may be punished, it may act against you. I have warned you many times not to exploit Sahaja Yoga for your advantage. It is for the advantage of others and not for your advantage. You already have got your own Realization. But exploitation should not be there at all. On the contrary, the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga is the best way to know Sahaj Yoga. So far we have had some bad experiences, but very, very few. Surprisingly, people who have never known even the first word: "Ga" of Ganapati, have become such devoted bhaktas of Shri Ganesha and they have understood the importance of innocence and of purity.

I'm rather sad today that all the Sahaja Yogis are now going away to their countries and I wish them that they carry this purity of Shri Ganesha with them, which is very much required in your countries, very much to be spread out. Only you have to desire and it will spread. I am sure things will change very soon and you'll have a much better, much better time. Moreover, I am sure also there are many people who think and who are seeking this truth and they're seeking also this purity. So only thing what you have to do is to find out, find out as to which people are those which are just striving to seek the truth. Try to find them out, it's very easy to find them out, and, also, after finding them out, do not argue with them, just give them Realization, let them feel the vibrations and then things will be better. There are many, many things which are false in this world. Lots of things are full of falsehood - doesn't matter. All this falsehood, everything can be easily cleared out by the Truth, the light of the Truth.

So today is - Shri Ganesha's temple is here, so we'll do Shri Ganesha's worship first and then the Devi's worship. I hope you people will say all the Atharva Sheersha and everything.

May God bless you all!

I hope you have enjoyed the Tour very much and now you are going with such good vibrations. Carry them to your own countries and give My love to all the Sahaja Yogis who have not come.

May God bless you all!
