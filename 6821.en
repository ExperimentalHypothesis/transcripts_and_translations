Prophecies of Acharya Bhujender. Sholapur (India), 30 January 1982.

Shri Mataji: Khandhavara, Indian [UNCLEAR], [FIRE], which deals with, the [FIREMEN].

Sahaja-Yogini: You talk [UNCLEAR]

The median one, that [BEINGS] that, that is based on the Moon. See, the Moon is the moodiest thing. And so we, we the Indians, follow the Moon. And here they have tried to establish how astrology is so correct. And whatever is predicted 14000 years back is also today coming up. But this is about two thousand years back. One of the great astrologers of this place, not Sholapur, but little downward, Karnataka, he described about this thing so clear-cut that, I mean, you'll be amazed, that he said that this great Yogi will come on this Earth on the Mina Rasi, the Pisces. So I'm just on the cusp of the Pisces and the Aries, you see. But that's not so important. Then he says that gradually we'll start seeing some miracles from 1964 to 66, which he says that, maybe little bit. But he says, the real change, Mahan Mankar, in the age, the new age, he will start from 1970. And by 1980 it will take its grip. All right? That time, by this new method, the new age will be formed and this, the old one, Vaivastav. You see, there's one another,... we have yugas, you see. One of the yugas will be over and that yuga is in Kali Yuga. So that's how Kali Yuga will be finished from 1970. Will be start receding back, Kali Yuga, and a new age of active Divinity will start, Kruta Yuga. New age of active Divinity, Kruta Yuga will start. That time, that time the Sun will rule in a new way, the Sun. The axes of earth will be reduced and the speed of the Earth will be reduced gradually. And that time a great Maha Yogi will be born who will be completely Parabramha, completely Parabramha. That's Me.

All Sahaja Yogis: Bolo Jaganamata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai

Shri Mataji: And He, He will possess all the powers to do or not to do. I mean is Mahakali and Mahalakshmi, all the powers, all the powers. Before this, people used to go into Bhakti, devotion, Gyana, means reading, Patanjali Yoga, and then they used to get their Mokshas. But with this new method that this Maha Yogi will bring in, the pure power within you, in your chakras, will rise and as a result the Kundalini shakti will be awakened and will be enlightening. Because of these new method of Maha Yoga you will see with your own eyes and you'll get it in this body in your lifetime, the Realization. And you'll get the joy of Realization. Imagine, two thousand years back. He's greater than Blake, I must say.

Sahaja Yogini: What's his name, Mother?

Shri Mataji: His name was....[Hindi] ... Bhujender, Bhujender Kaka, Kaka Bhujender. His name was Kaka Bhujender. Acharya Kaka Bhujender.

Sahaja Yogi: Acharya Kaka Bhujender. Satwachari.

Shri Mataji: Satwachari. Satwachari. You don't have to sacrifice this body. Many people, great saints, sacrificed their body in living condition. They went into a cave and shut themselves and died. That's not necessary with this new method. And you won't die either, means you will achieve your Spirit. And the "Sakshatkari Santvara shabdakari ka sant", the Realized Souls, the saints who are Realized, the Brahmananda, the joy of the Brahma, by this new Yoga. And they won't have to go into Samadhi. Samadhi is where people just sit down, go on meditating for hours together and the ants grow up on them, and all that is not necessary. Just without do anything like that they will get their Realization. And they will enjoy the joy of Brahma. The Sahaja Samadhi, this is Sahaja Samadhi, according to him.

Among millions, first one will get Realization. So you understand your own positions. You see, the way sometimes we flitter away our attention in nonsensical things, you realize that among millions you are one. This is written here. We flitter away our attention in useless things, like my husband, my wife, my children, this, that and that. So it is written here that among millions one will be selected. Do you follow that point? Then the, all the human race can get over their death or their destruction by this Yoga. You'll have to lead a life, a married life, a normal life, maybe may not married but like a normal householder. Otherwise you cannot get this Yoga [UNCLEAR]. Like if you become a big saint and a Sadhu Baba, or a guru or something great, you cannot get it. You have to be a normal householder, maybe married, may not be married Ã¢Ë†' it is not the point. Samsari means living in this Earth, in the "brass tacks", as you say.

Sahaja Yogis: Brass tacks. Brass roots. Grass roots.

Shri Mataji: Grass roots. Is grass roots. But brass tacks are also. Brass tacks.

Sahaja Yogis: Brass tacks, yes. That is to be in down to the bones.

Shri Mataji: Down to the basics. I'm getting American now.

Sahaja Yogi: But it is British, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Is it? Is it?

Sahaja Yogi: I think this brass tacks is British.

Shri Mataji: And what is the American for that?

Sahaja Yogini: I'll have to think about that...

Shri Mataji: Think it over.

Sahaja Yogini: I'll tell you.

Sahaja Yogini: Nitty gritty.

Shri Mataji: Nitty gritty. Then all your diseases will disappear so fast with this Yoga that you won't need anything like a hospital. In the beginning, these great yogis, you people also, only by touching people, you can cure people. It's a fact. Like the Ardhanari Nateshwara is the Shiva that will be the state of human beings. Their old age will disappear, their body will remain as it is and they will have a body which is divine. What a promise! So don't worry too much about your bodily comforts. All right? Then maybe some of you, if you want, you can fly in the air also, with that, with that body. Also they can become subtle and can enter into the body. That already you are doing, enter into the body of others to get them cured. That already you are doing. They will not be touched by the fire and any weapons. Also you will be able to see these subtle things with your own eyes. You can see them. This will not only happen in India, but all over the world. India is a country of great punyas. That's why there are powers, which will look after the protection of this country and this country will gradually rise. He says that the third world war, that was.... (Speaking aside: When was that time?)

Sahaja Yogis: Two. We had two so far. Second World War finished in '45, Mother. Maybe there will be none. Third World War. [Sahaja Yogis laughing...].

Shri Mataji: They may have go for a Third World War and they will have to suffer for it. After that this great Incarnation will interfere and all the countries will come together with the understanding of collective oneness. And they will understand that war is so horrible. In a very big, I don't know which one, in a very big city a conference of all the countries will be held. There not the politicians, but the Yogis will direct them, Yogis. There he calls you Yogis throughout. This might be the third war we had with China, maybe.

Sahaja Yogi: The Korean War, Mother?

Shri Mataji: No, maybe China because he says that because of China's aggressive policies and the Third World War, we'll have to bear lot of...

Sahaja Yogi: Line?

Shri Mataji: No, lot of...

Sahaja Yogi: Responsibility?

Shri Mataji: No, no, you will have to bear lots of problems, you see. And these we will have to fill up the gaps in. But by true prayers we will be able to unite all the countries.

Sahaja Yogi: Could be the Vietnam War.

Shri Mataji: By the new inventions of science, the Divine Knowledge and the science will become one. With the science we'll be able to establish the existence of God and of Spirit. That is how there will be no difference. There will be coordination between the science and the..., co-relationship between the science and the Spirit or, or the Divine Knowledge. Already we are getting it because, you see, on My photograph people get vibrations. It's a science, you see. On the television, mantras, all that, if you start curing through scientific methods, you're also using the science for that purpose. We can prove that these things can be carried by magnetic forces, by sound, by all these things, you see. We can prove it. Then he says that because of ignorance and because of Maya, Yogis had to suffer a lot to become collectively conscious, Brahmayeet, to feel the Brahma. But now... and they had to do lot of penance. That was so difficult. They'll become Sahaja. This is the word, Sahaja, Sahaja-Prapta [Prabha], Sahaja. And you have to give up anything to achieve Brahma.

In the new Yoga system, when it will manifest in the different countries, in the new age, the administration will be governed by people who have their own powers of Yoga. Depending on how far you are in your Yoga, and their qualities as Yogis, that will be the determining fact. They will be able to create a society, which will completely fulfill their desires and their necessities and people won't need to have money accumulated with them. [Hindi talk] The poverty and sickness will be completely finished and in their absence the country, the samada, the society will be healthy and restful and without any anger. They have described here about the China attacking India and all. These are other places but this is a quite a good thing. They have also given the name of Jacqueline Murray. She's an American lady. Jacqueline Murray.

Sahaja Yogini: M U R...

Shri Mataji: They don't spell. This woman had depicted about Me. And she had said that, she had said that a great personality will be born in India, a lady. She said about 1924. I was born in 1923. About correct. But Cheiro has said that by 1980 the new Advent will start a new age. There's a difference of ten years.

Sahaja Yogi: This is good.

Shri Mataji: There's a lady called Alice Belly. She's supraconscious, I believe.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is, Mother.

Shri Mataji: And in supraconscious state she, she has said that there will be a new... you see, because Indians have all their attention on Yoga, you see, so there will be a new Yoga which will come by which people will be connected to the Holy Ghost. She has said it, this horrible one, Alice Belly. There's a danger of a Third World War and is inevitable. But it may be avoided if people develop love for each other with this Yoga.

Sahaja Yogini: It's up to us.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you. There's lot of things but I've just read a part of it.

Sahaja Yogi: Let this be a prayer that it all comes true, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yea...Now this is a... another thing, ha. What's that? This one is a tape about what Gyaneshwara has said about this new age, what will happen. The translation of that is with Me, but it is in Marathi. I have to translate it in English, you see. That how people will become Realized and what will happen and how they will love each other and all these things He has said, Gyaneshwara. And this is sung in this record by a very well-known singer of India, Lata Mangeshkar. And this they want to give. Side one is Gyaneshwari and another is Om Namo Ji Addya , Addya Devi and Pasaydan, that is the second part. Now this is one they want to give it to Warren. And you can tape it and give it to everyone.

Sahaja Yogis: Thank You. Wonderful.

Shri Mataji: This is the sari they have got for Me from Sholapur. It is in nine yards. This is a place known for its handiwork. And I wish you have bought some of these bed covers here. You get very good bed covers. It's a famous place for bed covers. This is to be kept inside. This is the one they gave yesterday [UNCLEAR], all right? Here you don't have to wear a petticoat. You have to wear that kind of a thing at the back, you see as the Goddesses wear . [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]. They want to have a photograph. [Shri Mataji and yogis speak Marathi] You must send them a photograph, all right?

Sahaja Yogi: Barbara, would you make sure that you send the photograph to them?

Shri Mataji: Take their address and [RIGHT] before leaving, you thank all of them with your hearts and say that you are very thankful and you have been very happy here, all right?

[Shri Mataji speaking in Marathi]

Shri Mataji: You see, all of them have spoken with such love and such feelings, that it's too much for Me to translate, you see. So I am Myself now filled with that great feeling that firstly they are saying that you have come here. Because of that we have become aware that there are celebrations on, are on this place. And we feel that great festivities have started in our hearts. We are so very happy and we cannot express our happiness to what has happened to us. We feel we are just floating in the air. We don't know how we spent our time [WITH ALL THESE]. And you are My brothers and sisters and their brothers and sisters, and keep this fact in your heart and let it grow in your heart. And then we have done some mistakes, not deliberately, but it happened that we tried to reserve some halls but we couldn't. It's a small place. We couldn't give you a place, but you have a place in our hearts. [HERE] inconvenience has been passed. Three of them have been saying the same thing. So we want to beg of you thrice that, please forgive us if we have inconvenienced you or troubled you by anything, and we are very, very at fault because something had gone wrong with us, I think. We could not arrange stay for some people and the people at the lodge also ditched us and they didn't give us proper guidance. But next time we will arrange very well. Don't be angry with us. If you [UNCLEAR], if you have any anger you all should forgive. And Dhamle father also said that we have not been able to look after you and the little girl also said that we have not been able to give you the conveniences and everything. So you all, please forgive us and... but we ourselves have enjoyed that you're coming and we are gainers. We gained a lot from you, learned a lot the way you have shown patience to our mistakes and also we, we cannot say that there's anything to learn from us but whatever we have tried our level best, but sometimes happens like that. So please forgive us. And they have been asking for forgiveness.

Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR] us from these nice words. Could we help them in any way to solve the bottlenecks in spreading Sahaja Yoga? For example, if they need some material help, in [DOING] together possibility of renting the halls to count a bit or a distribution [UNCLEAR], whatever. We might you know see whatever we can help in one way or another.

Shri Mataji: All right, I'll tell them. That's very kind of you. [Marathi talk] They want to also thank you for giving them a tape-recorder as a present and all the, all the photographs and everything that you gave them. Their presents I'll give you in Poona because again the carrying will be a problem for you.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, more than anything, from all of us, we want to thank them for their love. Jai Mataji.

Sahaja Yogis (together): Bolo Jaganamata Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai. Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai. Parabrahma Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

Shri Mataji: That's all. I think you go ahead now. Finish the things and enjoy yourself.

Sahaja Yogis: Thank You, Mother.
