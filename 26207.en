Today’s experience is absolutely unique, which cannot be expressed in words. On the one hand the waves of the sea, and the shimmering beautiful scenery, and with that  so much from the heart , with love your  singing and music. My heart is just overflowing. You people are so far away, sometimes it seems, and sometimes there is worry also, that how can Sahaja Yoga spread. Obstacles are always there, there is nothing new about it .Everywhere obstacles are there and ups and downs keep happening.  But the depth that you all have achieved, that very few people have achieved. And this personality that you have, this excellent state of being that is made, with that I am fully confident that in  this Sahara place, here , as these people have made beautiful homes and such beautiful dwellings, you all will make new dwellings of Sahaja Yoga. Because in you people I have seen a special quality that is you have understood Sahaja from your heart.

To understand Sahaja is difficult because we are ASahaj (not Shahaj) and when we come into the Sahaja state, one gets filled with joy. Peace, solutions, and the sea like depth gets established in him. Seeing this love of yours one feels very fascinated  one doesn’t know from where to where  we may reach and how many  Sahaja Yogis may get established.   And whoever are there today, look like sparkling diamonds to me. Because everyone has a lot of depth. I didn’t see anyone who had not understood Sahaja from the heart. To understand Sahaja, one needs a very big heart, a very big heart. To understand it one needs a very pure, clean heart, clean heart. And in that heart should be unparallelled compassion, love and respect should be there. This doesn’t happen by talking about it , if I say do this , do that, doesn’t work that way, it has to happen, means it happens and in you this has happened.

It can be that Sahaja Yoga  is established on a small scale, you people for this reason have become very deep. This depth is extremely beneficial. That is there. And other people also will see you and get into Sahaja, come to Sahaja Yoga. There is no doubt in this. A lot of people can come. But the other benefit of this is that in the environment here, in the thinking process here , in the understanding here, Sahaja will come.

From a shop here you know I  keep buying  jewellery  for puja. The reason is you get it cheap here and in Pujas we need this jewellery a lot. And [UNCLEAR] . But that man he had a very bad backache, that I cured, and he started believing. After that I asked him do you have peace, calmness within you? He said now there is. I said okay, put your hands towards me. He started to shake a lot and he started getting cool breeze from his hands. Then I said that  a Muslim, until at the time of Qiyamah, until at the time of resurrection if his hands do not speak,  then he is not a Muslim. Then he will go to hell. This is what one must say. This is like that ,that you only decide, this is the last judgement,  in this either you will swim or you will drown. And the surprising thing is that in all three of them, their hands they starting getting the cool breeze. And they themselves were surprised. Then I said now you will get peace. They said we are very troubled. The conditions in Pakistan, first it was that, now it is this ,cannot understand what will happen. I said now everything will be alright. Slowly, this will spread. Slowly these people will surely come. Because such calamities have befallen them, they are searching, how can we somehow get peace. At our place some Kashmiri Muslims had come. And they started telling me we are Hindustanis and we will never go to Pakistan, never, because there whichever Hindustanis were there, they get killed. The second thing is that we do not want independence because the independent Kashmir that has been made, these people from [UNCLEAR] from Afghanistan, from Pakistan, these people have come and settled here and they have a lot of money. And on the basis of that money they are staying there and the Kashmiris also, getting this money, are doing all these things, but if you ask us the truth everyone wants peace. There we do not feel settled. We are Hindustanis and we want to stay in Hindustan. Not at all do we [UNCLEAR] All these things they said to me and I was surprised and as they were saying it , their Kundalini got awakened. Got awakened and on their hands they started getting coolness. So I said this is the work of the world, this work is happening  all over the world. You know that eighty six nations, in eighty six nations, Sahaja Yoga has spread. And a lot of Muslims, like in a country named Benin, it is a surprising thing that  seven thousand Sahaja Yogis got established in three years. Apart from that Turkey you know already now the situation ( cant hear ?) The situation of Turkey was such that a very big earthquake hit Turkey but not even one Sahaja Yogi in any way got affected, not even one Sahaja Yogi got harmed, their houses did not get harmed. All the people were surprised that so many people got devastated, it was mainly those people who were fundamentalists. They got destroyed.

Till today people who have come into Sahaja Yoga they get the blessings of a very long life. And as you said you are in a wave of bliss. Till today humanity did not know what is bliss. They did not know what is joy. He was surrounded but all kinds of troubles. But when he came to Sahaja and got connected to the all pervading  God, got one with it, then you see that man becomes something totally different. And amongst themselves so much friendship, familiarity and so much pouring of so much love, this is only because this is only inside you,is the essence of the spirit. And when you become the pure spirit, all its qualities, all its nature starts manifesting. To man and man becomes something else. This thing you have to established. Whether you are few or lots, you are very deep and with this depth I thing that one day here also there will be a lot of Sahaja Yogis. And I got a lot of joy , the experience was very good. And in such  few days you have progressed so much , not only that you have progressed but that  you have spread out, how deep will you become. Seeing your depth I am surprised. How you managed to become so deep. In reality this is a matter of great joy to me and infinite  bliss to me. And every year I  try to come here, the  programs  are made such that I cannot stay  even one day.  But nevertheless meeting all of you I got a lot of joy,  got a lot of peace.To all of you my  infinite blessings, infinite blessings, and in Sahaja keep progressing in this manner and in your life keep getting joy.

And you are all invited if you can come to Turkey, it’ll be good and this time Sahasrara Puja is going to be very strong so you can come  to Italy also and after that Ganapatipule also as you have said you can come. Wherever you wish to come, everyone gets a lot of joy. And everyone sees with great interest  from where to where you have become so deep.

And these songs that you sang, these were also very beautiful and I expect because of these songs you got a lot of sparkle. And I noticed that you all have a lot of sense about singing. And little little girls  sing so beautifully  aalaps (slow and melodic introduction to a raga ) and all,  it is incredible. And the good news is that in Pune, we have a made a school like Dharamsala, in that we will prepare children to be idealists. Compared to Dharamsala, the expense will be much less here and the training will be good. Surrounded by  mountains, I had got this place many years ago. And  now that school is being made and its foundation has been laid. So if you all would like to send your children there you can send them. Children above the age of 6 years, the entire scheme has been made  they are making. I had a great desire that if one school can be made here as well it would be very good.

Secondly, hearing your singing, I felt great joy and was very surprised. Now the thing is that Baba is no more, who had started this lots of academy but now we have another academy in Vaitarna and in that academy, mainly foreigners will come but you people who are talented who have a good voice , who have knowledge of music, who are spontaneous from inside in are involved in arts. For these people also we have thought. That these kind of people, who are Hindustanis who are outside, for them specially  there should be some arrangement that they would can understand their music and get into it. In this way  in all the children  they can get the knowledge of music and when they learn and come back then they can also teach others. Now, in total there were  ninety eight people there, but because Baba suddenly left us, so we moved the school to Vaitarna, where there is a very big river Vaitarna, near that  its been twenty, twenty five years  and because of that we came here and  in Nagpur that work didn’t happen, there we are going to start something else. But now this school also, its building work has started , and all the people are coming here, and everyone,  there all of you are invited, all of you come, maybe the inauguration will take place by next year, so all of you come once and see, to what level music has been taken and how much you all can benefit.

Like I saw these little girls, [UNCLEAR] they have a lot of sense about singing, they have a grip on everything, these little girls  you can keep and they can study also and side by side learn music also, because their studies also should not stop.

In this way we have thought of some arrangements, you will be surprised that we have approximately  seven lands in Maharashtra and in that we will do  seven kinds of social work. In that some women who are for example  widows, who have no support, for these women also in Delhi we have taken a place, there also a hospital. They would be having children also so for their children also I thought we should make a place and who are young girls, and in whose lives  there have been troubles, due to which they got troubled and had to run away, for these kinds of girls also we have taken a place where such girls can lead very healthy lives. These girls who have been shunned by their  mother and father [UNCLEAR] such girls can be brought with police protection and under police protection can be kept there.

In this manner there are a lot of matters in my mind which are very important for society, for social life. And specially what we have made for women for this I have thought that in our country specially in Uttar Pradesh , in north India, women are not very well respected. They do not understand women with love and because of this in our country there has been a huge [UNCLEAR] It is essential that we uplift these women and alongside there should be education of men. They should also be made to understand that married life [UNCLEAR]

Whatever all of you have done here, it is extremely deep and it will bear fruits, will definitely bear fruits. I also heard that here they do not allow Indians to come, in a few days they will have to let them come. Because except Indians no one is so intelligent . They are very intelligent people. Now what I say is that Saraswati is now united with Lakshmi and everyone is earning quite a lot . Those who have worked with computers are earning a lot of money and big nations like America their children cannot work on computers because in our children there is a lot of decency , very good [UNCLEAR] In this way the special qualities we have specially Hindustani women in society [UNCLEAR] , in maryadas and their character is alright. For them this is a very [UNCLEAR]admirable thing.

Now in Sahaja, children also need a lot of looking after. In them the the outside qualities,  outside nations are getting destroyed. You know [UNCLEAR] Now whatever is good will be made and what I want is that how ever much I can, I should also do this social work and Sahaja Yogis, how ever much they can should help us.

To all of you my infinite blessings, infinite blessings. And for all the joy that you have given today, for that many many thank you.
