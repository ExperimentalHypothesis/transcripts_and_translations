2000-0312  Public Program, Kundalini ki Jagruti se, (With Kundalini Awakening), Mumbai

Translation from Hindi:

I bow to all the seekers of truth.  First I will speak in Hindi, and after that in Marathi;  because it is our National language, and I feel that everyone should at least have some knowledge of Hindi.  Of course there is no language like Marathi. This I agree.  But the person who knows Marathi should find it easy to know Hindi.  It is a very easy language.

I have spoken to you many times about Kundalini, and I have explained that with the awakening of the Kundalini all the unwanted particles and fragments inside us, get removed.  The Six Enemies of the soul (Shadripus) inside us, like Lust, Anger, Greed, Attachments, Jealousy and Vanity – these shadripus are always troubling us.  This happens because whatever our brain sees, it always reacts to it.  Because of this reaction we feel inside our brain, that if we also do these things, we will get some advantage.  But these are our enemies, and if we adopt and encourage them, how can they be beneficial to us.

But the society we are seeing in these times, especially in this country of India, anarchy has spread; such unrighteous people have sprung up, that they have not only destroyed themselves but are trying to destroy the country.  Such kind of people are there, especially in Mumbai, and people say there are a lot of villains and evildoers.

It is difficult to understand what happened here to cause such people to flourish.  The reason for all this is, that this is the time of Ghor Kaliyug – The Terrible Age of Destruction.  We can recognize the Age of Destruction by the proliferation of such evil elements who are enemies of themselves, enemies of others, and enemies of the country.  They are the ones who will prosper and grow.  But for how long.  For as long as they do not get their transformation.  Their awakening.

When your Kundalini is awakened, you will be amazed at the change that comes over you.  Your reactions change.  One gentleman was telling Me, “Mother, when I came to Sahaja Yoga my state of mind changed.  Meaning that, whenever we got a transfer of location, my family, my wife, and I used to get distressed.  But it is the wonder of Sahaja Yoga that now we do not get upset.  I am happy.  And I am enjoying, that whatever had to happen has happened”.

There are so many such examples.  That when you get blessed by your Kundalini awakening, and when you receive these blessings, then you yourself get transformed.  There is no one to give you advice or examples.  This happens spontaneously.  Because this energy is placed within you.  God Almighty put this Shakti (energy) inside you.  But if you do not want to see it, you do not want to know about it, and you are wasting your time in other useless things, then for such people it is better that they do not come into Sahaja Yoga.

But those who are seeking, who desire to achieve something; who feel that in this lifetime if we can get our self realization, then what a great achievement that will be.  You don’t have to retire into the Himalayas, nor do you have to spend money to get it.  You don’t have to do anything.  So what a wonderful happening this is.  And to achieve it, you did not have to get into difficulties or do exercises.  God Almighty Himself has established this Shakti within you.  And it is important to get this energy awakened.  If you do not realize this now, then nothing can be achieved, and you have failed yourself.

Now you work hard, you experience a lot of difficulties, and you do so many activities, but up till now you have not experienced the pure joy.  In joy there are no two things, like happiness or sadness.  It is only joy.  Pure joy.  Secondly you do not find the truth.  Yes, may be half here and half there.  But the truth, the absolute truth, has not been found.  To experience that you have to get your Kundalini awakening.  That which causes your brain to react to everything, that will stop happening.  And when that stops, you get the connection with the all pervading divine energy which is around you.

The most amazing thing is, that this great happening is so easy and comfortable.  There are no headaches or severe exercises to be done.  No need to stand on your head.  And, this is available to everyone in this world.  This is for the whole world.  Not just for you.  Not just for a few others.  But for the whole world.

Sahaja Yoga has spread over 86 countries, and those people are immersed in it.  Fully absorbed.  They are happy, and their lives have become meaningful and complete.  And in their lives there is a kind of peace and contentment.

In every place, we must understand, where great religions have spread,   in every dharma it has been said that a day will come in which your transformation will take place.  In which you will attain a wonderful state.  And in the Koran it is written clearly that when Qayamat  (The Day of Resurrection) will come, your hands will speak.  It is there today!  But if your hands are not speaking, then what is the use.  To achieve this, is the main purpose or objective of your life.  If you do not desire to do so, it is your wish.  If you do not wish to receive it, it is your wish.  But this thing can happen, and is happening.  In many countries it has happened.  And it should also happen in our country.

So the turmoil and conflicts of this place, and seeing the unrest of every day, we should recognize and understand that we should attain this state, in which there is absolute peace, and absolute joy.  To achieve this you do not have to do anything.  I have already told you.  You don’t have to leave your homes or families.  Nothing to be done.  And, you have to receive this.

The problem with us, especially in Maharashtra, is that people have too much knowledge.  They have collected a big bundle of gods and goddesses in the house, and spend their time from morning till night, doing pujas, and this and that.  They have gone in that direction.  Or, they will do some other kind of activity.  This is the situation with Hindus, and also with the Muslims, and also the state of Christians.

When, inspite of all these entanglements, nothing has been achieved, they should also look on the other side, that what is the thing I have to achieve.  By which I will be able to know myself.  And then that truth will dawn on us, in which there is only truth, and no falsehood.  We will come to know that.

The great scientist Einstein, in his papers, has talked about this.  And he has called it the “torsion area”.  And he has said that this realization of truth will come from the torsion area,  and it is necessary for you to get your connection with that truth.

Until and unless you get this connection, whose praises are you singing in worship.  No one even knows you, and you are chanting their names.  Whatever you should be actualizing by this chanting, you will not achieve.  The real thing will only happen when you come into the reality.  And all the possible divine energy will pour into it.

It is not a difficult task.  I have told you that if you practice Sahaja Yoga for a full month, then you will become your own guru.  And you yourself will be able to cure the diseases of others.  It is not necessary for you to go to any other place, or take help from others.

This truth, no matter how many times it has been told, does not enter the attention of people.  This is very unfortunate.

Because a time like this, just had to come.  How can it be possible, that the God who has made this creation, can watch the people that He has created, get beaten, tortured and suffer, and have all kinds of problems.  Never!  Definitely He has made some kind of arrangement within ourselves, to overcome all these difficulties.  All the saints and holy men have talked about it.

Kabir has spoken very openly, but people could not have understood him.  Maybe because he used poetic language and people failed to interpret it correctly.  But Kabir has said very clearly.  Whatever he has said, it is all about Sahaja Yoga.  He has said it very clearly in his (Dohas) couplets.  Where he has talked about Ida, Pingala and Sukhumana Nadis.  Now someone might say, what is this Ida, Pingala and Sukhumana Nadi.  You come into Sahaja, and everything will become clear.  Soonya Shikhar par Anahat Vaadi Dein (In the silent pinnacle or summit, there is the unstruck sound when the spirit merges with the absolute).  Now who knows what is Soonya Shikhar, and what is Anahat Vaadi.

In Hindi language a lot of poetry has been written about this.  Guru Nanak especially, has given it a lot of predominance.  All saints and sages have written in the same sequence and essence.  When Namdev, who was a great poet and a great saint of Maharashtra, arrived in Punjab, Guru Nanak welcomed him with great recognition.  And he told him, “Son, you study Punjabi language, and then write in Punjabi”.  He has written such a big book in Punjabi, and in that he has fully described Kundalini, Adi, etc., and everything very clearly, and in very beautiful language.

Now, Namdev was a devotee of Shri Rama, and he believed in Sagun roop (where the deity is personified, having qualities and attributes).  Nanak Sahib said to him, “See, it is not wrong to believe in sagun form, because you are a realized soul.  It is alright for you.  And you know the difference,  as to which sagun is real and which is not;  which material form is swayambhu  (self existent), and which is not.  But the rest of the people do not know this.  So for them you must talk only about Nirgun (formless, attributeless)”.  And Kabir has said, “I will nirbhay (fearlessly) sing about nirgun, (the formless).  I will become Nirbhay (fearless) and sing about Nirgun (the unqualified, absolute being)”.  He said, “I am not afraid of anyone, and I will only talk about Nirgun”.  And this is what it is.

Adi Shankaracharya also wrote, and called it Spandh.  Spandh means the experiencing or feeling of Chaitanya (vibrations), which is within you.  The feeling of Chaitanya, which we call as Vibrations. That is Spandh.  Everyone speaking the same thing.  Even in foreign countries people have talked about this.

But let the talk of books remain in the books.  And nowadays we don’t know what strange ideas affect the brain, and people do not want to understand what it is.  Why am I going on the wrong road; why am I troubling everyone;  why have I supported this wrong course of action....they don’t think about these things.  And what is the result of all this. Is that mankind has gone astray.  He has wandered into wrong paths.

But by that he destroys himself, not others.  No harm to others.  Only harm to himself.  There are many roads to destruction.  You also know this, and you also have seen others going into their destruction.  Just by telling them, nothing can be achieved.  I have seen this.  If I tell them don’t do this, or don’t do that, half of the people will get up and go from here.

But when your kundalini is awakened, you yourself will understand and become aware that this is wrong, it is harmful for us.  This is because, the light of your spirit rises from your heart and comes into your attention.  And every human being will understand, the one who is a realized soul, he will realize what is wrong and what is harmful, and why it is so urgent and necessary.  This is the speciality of your Self Realisation.  Where you can clearly understand what is good for you, and what is bad.

And in addition to this, besides this, all the help of the Paramatma (God Almighty) is with you.  Because the energy of Divine Love is spread on all four sides.  Prem (love) this is a very important, strong and competent power with you.  A very big capacity.  Such a great power exists within you.  This love is called Nirvaaj Prem, (unconditional love), where you do not expect anything, but just go deep down into the ocean of love.

The language of love is something different.  The methods and practices of love are different.  The style and manners are grand.   Especially Sahaja Yogis have experienced this.  We think that such people are very rare.  Not at all.  There are lots of people who are gracious in love.  What a great thing is love.

But speaking nicely to people seems to be difficult nowadays.  If you go further, then stealing each other’s things seems to be the order of the day.  And if you go another step further, then in the country all kinds of transgressions and tortures are being committed.  Those who cause destruction, disorder, depression and remorse, and things like that, are proliferating.

Human beings were not born for this.  Human beings were born to know the Shakti, the power of that Paramatma, Almighty God; and experience and enjoy that power, and forever live in peace.  The best thing for spreading peace is, that there should be a reformation of man.  Until and unless man does not change; until and unless this light shines within him, till then he will keep going astray.  He will continue to do this kind of misdeeds.  He will keep getting involved in these kind of things, in which he will not even know whether he is on the right path or not.

That is why we should light the lamp within ourself.  When this lamp becomes enlightened, you will be able to understand everything easily, that what Shakti lies within us.  And how we can benefit from this Shakti.  This is the Shakti of Love.  It is very superior, this Shakti of Love.  Not a shallow, superficial love, but very deep and profound; and flowing through, like the  ocean.  And with the help of that love, you will live in complete peace.  And you will give this joy to others as well.  This Great Shakti is within you, and I will only make this request, that you accept and respect this love.

24:51 to 44:45 [Marathi talk - translation missing]

Translation from Hindi: 

You people must be understanding a little Marathi at least.  Having lived her for so long, you must have learnt the language.  If you do not learn, then how can these people learn Hindi.

I was just telling everyone that those who do not want their self realization, can please leave and go outside if you wish.  I agree that Marathi is a difficult language, but it is very eloquent and fine.  And as far as Yoga is concerned, there is no better language to express it than Marathi.

What about Hindi language.  What is so difficult about learning two languages.  Not difficult.  There is no harm if you learn a little Hindi.

[Marathi to English Translation]

I bow to all those who are seeking God. What has been said is true that only that person who is seeking God will actually receive God. This is true. There is no reason to doubt this, because God is not going to come and fall at your feet saying, “Dear one, please search for me”. But it is a state. It is a special state attributed to such people who have evolved in their past lives and who have done good pure deeds. Those who are of a very dignified mind, and who have always done a lot of good deeds. It is only for such special people.

“Yedya Gabalyaache Kaam Navhe.” 

“It is not something for any random person who is not of a good standing. “

Especially here in Satara district, the very famous Shri Ramdas Swami has lived here. And if you take any saying of his, it is completely the description of God almighty. He has angrily described this to those who are of a lower state of being, and he has said such things that only he could have said. I consider him to be an avatar of Shri Hanuman. I consider him to be of a very high stature.

But here in Maharashtra, whatever is heard of is less. If one were to describe, this is the land of saints. Great, special people have graced this land. This really is Maha-Rashtra (the Great State). There is no doubt about it. That we have turned it all into mud, that is a different story. But this truly is Maharashtra. And similar to its name, to carry out the good work, there have been innumerable brave people. Shivaji himself was a self-realised person. If not, it wouldn't have been possible to get such a fine person of such great characteristics. He got a Guru like Ramdas Swami. There have been great poets here like Tukaram. Gora Khumbhar, Naamdev, Sakhubai... especially then Dnyaneshwar as well.. At such a young age he wrote out that beautiful book of Dnyaneshwari. So then, they were lying. They didn't go about gossipping like politicians. Or they were not corrupt like civil servants. They wrote and praised God (Parameshwar). They described God and placed a new idea in front of you to seek and obtain God. There is no other path other than God. 

And also, when they met each other, they didn't understand this discrimination of caste and creed. When Naamdev met Gora Khumbhar, he described it beautifully.

“Nirgunaachya Bheti, Aalo Sagunaashi.”

“What I was looking for as the formless, I have come to meet in a physical form.”

Wherever you look, whatever poetry you look at, what great stature it has. Just by studying these things, you cannot understand them. This doesn't mean that you should not be educated. You should of course be educated. But to understand this and to enlighten your education, you should attain God. Otherwise, there is no use for your education.

Now, the Honourable Mr Patil has honoured me so much, and I am very grateful to him for that. His father has done so much good work here that he has been awarded a medal named “Karmaveer”. I had the opportunity to find out so much about him and I am indeed very happy that such a great society has honoured me.

That education, well, that has now been done. We learnt how to write the language, mathematics etc. We learnt other subjects as well. But in the background to all this education, one must definitely be enlightened. If one needs to see how this mundane education goes to waste if you aren't enlightened, you should visit foreign countries. The first thing that hits such a person is Ego. They just cannot bend. They just cannot bend. It is said that education does not show up in good behaviour without humility. That good behaviour is nowhere to be seen because this knowledge is very artificial. How much realism is in there?

This much is true that the science of God, the science of the power of God -- it takes people of a certain stature to take care of it. It is not possible to keep it in the hands of mundane everyday folk. Then it doesn't matter whether you are educated or not. Now let us assume that we have a lot of Doctors with us. Architects came along. They came to Sahaja Yoga and understood the Truth. And they properly understood this power of God. And through that, they have evolved and progressed a lot. I agree with that. But that would have happened even without that education. If you were to attain the Aatma (Spirit).. Aatma is everyone’s Guru and is sitting in everyone’s hearts. Today, especially, as it is Shri Datta Jayanti (the birth anniversary of Shri Dattatreya), we should all submit to Shri Datta with a prayer that “Mother, please make us all our own Guru”.

What I mean is that all this knowledge and this science is all in your heads, and you don't really need to go out anywhere. After all, which university did Dnaneshwar give his exams in? Which school did Shri Saint Tukaram get admission into? Which school did Jesus Christ get his education from? They have obtained all that from a very short path, which we could call as a short cut. Everyone can take that. To all Indians and to all the people living in Maharashtra, that path is freely available, and it befits them all very easily.

But this big problem that we have in Maharashtra should be very well understood by us. There is a saying in Hindi - “Adhaghar ghaghari chhalakkat jaaye” [translates as a half empty pitcher will splash out the water]. We have a half baked education. It has not reached a completed stage. Not in the developed countries and even with the renowned people in this country, they have realised that there is something beyond this, the source of which we should attain. But this big problem we have in our country, that if we cannot manage it, then we act mischievous about it. And to act flightily and mischievous. For example, if someone doesn't understand classical music, let's say. It requires some understanding, some education, some sense of listening, and depth in a person. It is difficult to be understood by just anyone. But if you don't understand, then they make fun of it. So then they dismiss it. And due to this stupidity, any thing that carries a gravitas is something we cannot attain. This characteristic that we have got, especially the journalists now-a-days. I remember giving a speech here in Satara, and they printed an article against me in Kirloskar [probably a local news outlet]. It just didn't have any meaning to it. They didn't mention anything about Sahaja Yoga. Everyone already knows that Kirloskar doesn't believe in God. But to then brand everyone else in such a manner, that all this is false and that God doesn't exist. Who are you to write such things? Have you seen God? If you don't understand such things, then you should think with a little bit of humility. Were all these great saints who lived here, were they all idiots? Or were they all frauds? So they just started abusing me in that article. So all these well-educated people are going to have their heads working like this... even in the women’s magazine, they printed an article that there is nothing called God.. Mataji is telling us something that isn't true, and that the Kundalini doesn't exist. This over-smart attitude is going to work to their detriment. This has to be understood. The reason we have not progressed in Maharashtra is because of this mischief making. The main thing here seems to be how to erase out the other person. 

But Sahaja Yoga is for your benefit. Is Krishna also stating a falsehood when he says - “yogakshemam vahamyaham”. Which means that once you have Yoga, you will get the well being. I sometimes think that all these people are riff-raff, because they have never achieved any depth. If they look at the Shastras in depth, then each time since the time of Adi Shankaracharya, and you call yourself Hindu, even the great Adi Shankaracharya who set up the whole Hindu dharma has stated that no one should claim any thing until the Kundalini has been awakened. So I am not telling you anything new. But on the basis of some dharma, they will create a society or on the basis of some other thing, and then they will try and erase the other. Putting yourself in such handcuffs, it means that we will never evolve. There is a joke in England about us Maharashtrian people. You should listen to it so you understand what others are thinking about how a Maharashtrian person is. They brought scorpions in from all over for some experiment. And one of these jars holding the scorpions didn't have a lid. They said this has come from Maharashtra. So they were asked why there was no lid on that. They replied that it is impossible for any scorpion to escape because the moment one tries to climb out, another will drag him down.

They will have an excuse or the other. The day before I asked them why they didn't print something about Shri Ramdas Swami. Oh because he was a brahmin. So because he was a Brahmin they ignored him. So then what about Tukaram... they will call him Tukoba. Why? Because he was not a Brahmin. So pull one person down because of this and another down because of that. This attitude to fight all the time and this anarchy is still continuing in Maharashtra. And until it continues, we will continue to regress. To get out of this rut, the first thing you should do is to awaken your spirit. I keep coming back to Satara to say this, but there is no effect on people.

Wherever you go in the university - they will fight. Wherever else, there is a fight. Earlier, I went into this project. It has been going on for the past seven years, and nothing seems to happen. So I thought I should go and have a look. They said there are two groups, each suggesting one particular village that should be represented. And they don't look at the poor people who are getting eviscerated due to that. Even when we have everything, we should let go of this pettymindedness. But the one thing they have held on to is alcohol. Alcohol, they will definitely drink. Which shastra has said that you should be drinking alcohol? That doesn't take any time of theirs, but that which is for the benefit, and that which is good, that which is subtle and has been advised, why do they not do that? The reason for that is because we are still in delusion.

All this is in abundance in the west. Where I live in England, they also are a lot in delusion. It is not just here, it is everywhere. But they understand that they are living in delusion. Here, that realisation isn't there. That is the difference. We are in delusion, something is not right. Because when we fall from the cliff into the abyss, then they realised that even though we were already in the pits, we have gone down even further. They have understood this that they have been in delusion. That much has been understood by them. And for us, we have not yet realised that we are in delusion. Oh no, we think we are all right; we are all really smart. And thinking no end of themselves. That there is something beyond all this, that our country has this legacy, such a magnificent legacy. Even Shivaji Maharaj used to say that it is the desire of “Shri”. Who is this “Shri”. Shri means Adi Shakti. It was his continued mantra that this was Shri’s desire. Now all that, you can only see in the theatre. But shouldn't we have that shining through in us humans now? Was that all false? All that history; was that all false? All these massive magnificent forts we have standing around - was this all false? And that we are here today, is on the back of all of this. So we have gone and forgotten our legacy as well. And no thought of the future, not of our kids. If we had that, we wouldn't have brought his dirty alcohol into our country.

At least on this special day for Dutta, we should bring this thought into our heads. You can become your own Guru. No one needs to tell you this. There is no point in me coming and telling you this each time. What is the point anyways - it is like water off a duck’s back. You should get your spirit awakened. This spirit will ensure that all sorts of discrimination gets destroyed, because this is a collective being. A collective being, and it is the one element of God embedded in everyone. That same basic element is there in all the Gods. All of you are Gods, and that basic element of the spirit resides in all of you. It has been said that all of you are temples. All you need is for that light to come within you and your attention so whatever knowledge you want or whatever kind of prosperity or satisfaction you want can happen for you. Saints have said that “Avghachi Sansar Sukhacha Karina” [All the world will be made full of peace]. This is exactly what I am trying for, that what has been said should be made evident. 

What has been said in the Pasaaydan [a treatise written by Saint Dynaneshwar] is what we have to do today. But who should I do that to? I keep thinking .. Where are those people? If some movie star actress comes up tomorrow, then thousands of people will go and fall at her feet. This personality trait of slavery in us where we don't have any self respect and give respect to all these things that are superficial - this is wrong. When this education was given and Mr Patil must have done so much hard work, he must have thought about it all before doing so. And his thought surely would have been that if this education happened then the knowledge provided by the saints would be read and the people of today will have the light awakened in their heads. And then they will attain God. The only reason to have this knowledge is to attain God. 

Dnyaneshwar saw that the general public couldn't understand Sanskrit so he wrote the Dnyaneshwari in a very simple language. But look at the result. No one seems to understand anything. They have built a nice temple in Mumbai dedicated to Dnyaneshwar. So we went there and told them that we would like to meditate there. They said no. You can only have processions. When I asked why they said - “No, you can only have processions here.” I asked them whether Dnyaneshwar, of whom they had erected statues all over, had ever carried out processions? It is OK sometimes to celebrate and dance due to the joy. But to only carry out processions all the time - don't you need to look at his legacy. So they said - it was different for him. So I asked them why they built a temple for him? I have never seen a temple built for someone because of processions. If it is a procession carried out in Joy, then that is fine. There is no problem with that. That is some kind of a calling to God from us. But it doesn't mean that you should not meditate and not go deep within oneself. That you should not get to know your own wealth. Does it mean that you should not know your own knowledge?

Now the state of the world today is such that if you do not awaken from this delusion, then you are going to dissolve into it. This is the same situation all around the world. That is why these people are now aware of it, because they are alert. They are alert; we are not. Our priority is that as long as we get to eat once in the morning, we are happy. That is all. If there is a god, he will give me a bed. We are not ready to go a step further. But we can actually attain this faster than these people. Because they have got it after going through all kinds of trials and tribulations. They are here because of all those problems. Why should you go through those troubles? You should simply obtain it.

But one should have some sense of single mindedness about it, and we don't even have that. That one should sit and meditate for 2 minutes and to realise God in those two minutes. Are you going to get God without that? Sahaja Yoga means something that has been born within you - Saha - Ja. Born with you, within you. You have a god given right to this Yoga. This is your god given right. Tilak [one of Maharashtra’s foremost leaders during the Independence struggle] stated that Swaatantra (Independence) was our god given right. And he was correct. But what I am saying is that you should have the “Swa” of the “tantra” [an understanding of the subtle system]. 

What great achievements have we got with independence? You know the situation we are in. Are we really independent? Consumed by alcohol, or jealousy, or lust or ego. That is how we are. It does not look like we have got independence. We call ourselves independent but we are beholden to the Shadripu [the six enemies of the self]. Until you do not know your own self, you will not be independent. What sort of independence do we have now? If we had this real independence, then our country would have really been in a different place today. People would have thought differently about our nation. But it is not like that now. It isn't. This corruption that we have. Torture of women and of men, different kinds of crimes that do not make any sense. If you want a solution to all of these things, then first you should awaken your spirit. Once you awaken the spirit, your ego will dissolve. Your bad habits will dissolve and any diseases you have will dissolve. All this has to happen. Krishna has said - Yogakshemam Vahamyam. [Once yoga will take place, your prosperity will be looked after].

Just being superficially knowledgeable about it is not going to work out. The example of Karna from the Mahabharata is a very good study. Karna was a very charitable person; he donated a lot to people. He gave away and did a lot of things for people. But when his foot got stuck during the battle, and Arjuna held back his arrows, Karna said to Arjuna that as you are brave and so am I, until my leg is freed up, you should not release your arrows. Krishna gave the rule of Dharma at that time asking Karna where that bravery of Karna had gone off to when Draupadi’s chastity was being attacked. Where were you then? And he ordered Arjuna to release the  arrows. This is exactly what our situation is going to be. Just being superficial about it or showing some outwardly demonstration of work is not going to benefit at all. Until you do not attain God and until you enter the Kingdom of God, nothing is going to work out for us.

You are going to see innumerable benefits the moment you enter His Kingdom. Lots of blessings. After all, he is God. He is very great. People think it is all talk, and there is nothing called God. Lots of pandits speak like this. They say this because they are out to swindle us. Just like so, Badwe had started something against me saying Shri Mataji says there is nothing called God. I asked him what he was doing in the temple. His response was that he was running his business there. Nice... you continue with your business. So now because for him it has become a business, he cannot believe that God can exist. And so they are very open about it.

So this is not just talk. You should try and experience it. It will happen once you do it. There is no point in arguing with those who aren't yet in Sahaja Yoga. So I have given up on it. Because they are very good at arguments  and debate. That's the only thing they seem to have learnt. God is beyond all of this, and we cannot realise his power and greatness until we awaken our spirit. The spirit is the source of that special state and that special personality, where you can see and experience God. You comprehend... Or otherwise, you just go to the temple of bow down and say we went to Tulja Bhavani [a temple to the Devi]. 

The kundalini is explained in these songs that we sing everyday in Maharashtra. Now.. “Jogawa Maagena Aaila”. I will ask my Mother for Yoga. If they suggest singing this song, everyone will be able to sing. Naamdev has said - “Bodhaachi Bharani me Paradi”. Bodh - that means to know this in our central nervous system, not just in our heads to be able to continue giving speeches. Otherwise they will sit and continue praying. They will be praying about Dutta and will be reeking of the smell of alcohol from their mouths. Is there any sense to this? There is only one way to get rid of this pretentiousness and that is to awaken your spirit.

But that seems not to be possible. That doesn't happen. If I declare that I will come here tomorrow as a Babaji and ask everyone to give me 10 Rupees each, I know that there will be thousands of people who will turn up. Because 10 rupees is good enough, isn't it. We will get our Gurupad in 10 rupees - it is worth it and cheap to have this Guru in 10 rupees. Then they will say this Guru is cheaper than that other one. And this Guru isn't even asking you to let go off any habits. It is OK to continue drinking alcohol.

Now, I don't ask you to give up anything. Nothing. Once your spirit is awakened, you will see.. You will lose these habits immediately. Everything will just fall off. Automatically.. Because he is all-powerful and once you have this power within you, why should I have to tell you to do this, that and the other. You will be looking at yourself. And what is yours is after all.. Yours. So once you get it you yourself will ask me how there was so much on offer and we had no clue about it?

We had so much wealth? But the first thing that should go is the Ego, isn't it. There is too much Ego. “I understand everything. I pray.” Ok, but did you actually achieve anything till now? You did so much but did you get something? God is within you, and you should attain him first. Everyone has told us about it so why do we not put our attention there?

So, this is my fervent prayer to all of you. This wealth exists within us. I have come here so often, but I do not understand what it is about Satara district. It doesn't seem to work out so well. People do say now that something is working out, and many people are coming. But still.. It's the same in Pune. There are a lot of snobbish people in Pune. Too much!!! And mischievous. They will continue gossipping about something or the other. That's all they seem to do there is hurl taunts at each other. They do not understand anything beyond that - these Punekars. But Sahaja Yoga has worked out there, so why not here. Are people that much more obstinate here? Why not here?

If the wealth is with you, and you are well educated. Why do you not comprehend this? What has gone wrong? There is no humility. In Sahaja yoga, you need to have humility, and once you have it, God will be there for you. So I have seen that it works a lot in the villages. Then they will say that they are doing well. Is that not so in the cities - are they all in a perfect state here? Let me get to them, and then see. Just a day earlier, I met this person who is an industrialist and he was suffering from Angina. I cured him, and he went around the village and brought over all those who had angina and all other sorts of diseases. I had to ask him whether he had opened up a hospital. He requested me to look after all of them. Why? Why should I do this? First, attain God. Once you are in the Kingdom of God, then it is my responsibility. You are not in my kingdom, so first you have to attain that. Then I will cure everyone. If not, I am not responsible for you and what is the relation we have to each other? I am sitting here in the Kingdom of God and you are somewhere else. So then I am not bothered.

Come in once, and after all, God has made all the arrangements for you. He is waiting for you to see when you step to his door. He is waiting to see when he can have you sit on the throne. He is looking to see where his children have wandered off to. And here.. All we are doing is appearing oversmart. So this artificialness and this falsehood... too much. You have to go into the depths here, and you won't get anything until you get there. So people say what is the point? Not like this. You should only hark out to God and it will work out. But you should have the belief.. Not blind faith. I don't want money from you, and I don't want to exploit you. I am here to give you what is yours. That's all. But then when people ask a question, it will be so rude. There is so much abruptness now in Maharashtra. I don't understand when they are going to understand civility. People in Lucknow are not abrupt like this. Not in Delhi. People in Delhi are not as abrupt as they are in Maharashtra. All they don't do is hurl abuse, but there is a lot of rudeness here. This is not a sign of good education.

What I have come to give you here. And pleading to you saying - please, I have made the food for you. Sit down and enjoy the food. But you should at least have the hunger. If you don't have the hunger, you will kick the plate away. How many times am I to come to those who do not have any hunger? So, everyone should take to Sahaja Yoga with humility and become your own Master and spread it out to others. Because this is God’s gift and today especially it has worked out. So everyone should receive it.. This is my fervent prayer to you all.

What I have to say is that they called me here with such honour. And organised it so well. So on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis, I offer them my thanks.

Now if you have any questions, please ask them now. Otherwise, do not get up in the middle and walk off. You should have a little bit of patience. At least a little bit.

The source for all your science also is God. He has made this universe. If you can understand the basis of the 5 elements, then you do not have to do so much hard work. But since science is there, you can use science to prove it and explain it to everyone. A very famous agriculturist from the UNO came to me. And he was an advisor there in all those areas of work. And he is a Muslim from Iran. He came to Sahaja Yoga and he tried to experiment with the vibrations on the product. And it could grow 10 times is what he says and he has photos of it all. And he is going to take that word around to other countries to get more funds sanctioned.

But for it to come here from outside... How shameful is it? For people to come from outside to Satara and then talk about Shri Ramdas Swami.. What words would you have for this? This is your legacy. This is why I do not understand that people from abroad have to come and tell you about this. Does this look good for us? It is all within us, and if you just let go of our ego, then everything will work out, won't it. So why should we be so snobbish about it all? Is there any meaning to it. People from abroad coming and telling you about it.. I feel very ashamed about it. Myself.. I was born here in Maharashtra. I know how great Maharashtra is and that is why I took my birth here. And now people from abroad come here and tell you about the greatness of Sahaja Yoga and the scientific questions that were solved, and about architectural problems that were solved or some others. Or that we have resolved some medical issues due to this. That they should come and tell you about this, isn't it better that you should learn it yourself in the first place? And if a city dweller and someone from the village can learn about it similarly, then what is the harm in it?

Everytime I tell you the same thing, that it has to work out in Sahaja Yoga. There is absolutely nothing to be done now, except for this seed to be planted in the Earth. And automatically it sprouts. Nothing needs to be done, does it? It is a living process. But once the shoots grow, it has to be cared for. And once it is cared for, and it grows, it will become a tree. And the fruits are going to come up on these very trees. This is not a difficult thing. It is going to happen. Today. If you are not going to have this done in Satara, then I will get it done somewhere else. But why? Spare a thought for Ramdas Swami. He came and lived here for so many days. Spare a thought for him.

Now come down and sit. There is no need to go there at the top to sit. Come down here and sit for meditation. Come along.. Sit on the floor. Sit comfortably on the ground. This earth is your Kundalini. Come along.. Come with some humility everyone and be awakened. Come down and sit. If those who never sat on the ground are doing so, then why should we not? Come and sit down comfortably. Everyone, come down humbly and sit. Now I saw Mr Patil’s photo and he looks like such a humble person. He is so humble, because he is a saint. Come on.. Sit.

[a person asks a question: inaudible]

That yoga is of no use. I will tell you. Come on and sit down. Whatever yoga and worship you did was all just words. Here we have an experience. First, we should experience and then we can talk about it. What is the point of reading so much about it.

[the person asks again: this knowledge about god is so great, and there were great saints here. It is available to people in India. But why was it that discoveries happened abroad and not here?] 

Please sit down. The question is very good. Very nice. I will tell you. But please sit down. The question is very nice that our Indian tradition and culture is very great. Agreed. And lots of saints took birth here, and the power of God exists here in India. And all these inventions of the television etc happened abroad. Why did we not have these discoveries here?

The main reason for that is that there are principally two states to a tree. Firstly, the tree itself and secondly the roots. This country has the roots to the entire universe. Abroad.. We have the tree. That tree grew and the people there have made all the inventions and progressed, but now those people have been driven to suicide because they do not know of their roots. Now these countries, those that we call very prosperous - there are 4 such countries. And they seem to have a competition amongst themselves in those 4 countries on who commits the most suicides. So, after all this innovation and these discoveries, what they ended up with is suicides. And they are all begging. Their situation is much worse than ours. Much worse. Nobody cares about the other; there is no peace in the household. The people are just running away from those countries. They don't know what to do. And they know that there is some place where they are mistaken. And so when they say that in the 18 years of our life, we have had a realisation... so now they have seen the intellectualism of the entire tree but they can't see any joy there. So even if they have the radio and the television, where has the joy gone? So now to find that joy, they have now come to Hindustan [India].

Now if you look at the basics of economics, it is that any wish you have will be satisfied, but not all of your wishes will be satisfied. Not in general, but in particular. Now this is the main theme of that science. So if today you want a motor car, you will have one. And tomorrow you want a house, you will have a house. And so on and so forth. Now because your wants never end, you never get joy. Aren't we there on the basics? This basic has gone there.

We want something; someone wants to become a minister or something else. But my dear, are you at peace? Then they will have a sorrowful face. Why? didn't you get what you wanted? I have seen the richest of people. They too are similarly sad. I have never seen anyone who has a peaceful life. Not peaceful. Why - because the basic principle has gone missing.

That principle we had in India. That foundation - it is here. But we have now gone and forgotten it, and we are going running behind them. We had such a big responsibility of looking after the principle and we left that to run after these people. We have 300 years of servitude in our mentality, don't we? It is a good thing Columbus didn't come here. Otherwise, he would have finished us off properly. He went and killed all those who lived in the Americas. Now they only have the whites there. You hardly ever see any original indigenous inhabitants there. We would all have been finished. I think Hanuman must have worked his (Columbus’) direction differently and told him not to come to these shores. 

So the principle is here. So these people are on the tree, and we are running behind them. We should first figure out why we don't look for those roots? You have the roots in your hand, they have the tree and they are falling off from that tree one by one. So they made all those discoveries; agreed. But there is no happiness (joy) in those discoveries. Now these people - they don't watch television (we don't want it), or the radio (we don't want it). To meditate on Krishna - that is a joy to behold. We have forgotten that principle. That which God has given us, and that we have grown up on - we have left that behind and are running after other people.

And we think they are happy? Not at all. No one. We should not be blind about it. There is nothing worth learning from them. My dear, in England, and within London, which is an important area there, an average of at least two kids are being killed by their parents each week. I am not lying. The parents are killing off their own kids. And not just sub-average kids. Good proper kids. They suffocate them. They kill their paren'ts, grandparen'ts. Kids of eight years old - they are killing them. And kids of eight years old are also killing others. They are such murderous people. They are murderous because they don't have that basic love.

The foundation of that love is what is here in India. And we have forgotten that love. Even now we have this anomaly within us too. We also have stopped paying attention to it. This is the basic principle. Once we figure that out, this radio and the television is nothing but dust off our feet. You should obtain that main wealth - this is what I am saying. Now, did you understand?

And you should go and ask these people how bad the situation is in their countries. We think so.. From afar everything looks beautiful. I have lived there for 12 years, and again my husband has been elected to stay there for another 4 years. I was thinking even Ram only had 14 years of exile. I will have 16 years of exile there. I am sick of those people. They are such dirty people. From that, these people here have come up like lotuses. It is just mud otherwise. You are better off as flowers. That is why the moment some Indian goes there, they start worshipping that person. You don't know your own greatness is what I am saying. You really do not.

So, do not look at those people. They are a dirty lot. There is nothing there. Even after making so many discoveries, they have made an atom bomb hanging over their own heads. When that will explode, no one knows. They will press one button, and everything will be destroyed. There is no wisdom. They do not have Ganpati. We have Ganpati. How big is that? There is such a big treatise about Ganpati. Rather than understanding that, they will keep a ganpati (statue) and whether you are a doctor or an architect, they will just do a namaskar to it. My dear, at least awaken that Ganpati that is already existing with you. “Eh? How can you say such a thing? Which science does it say so in?” I said this is not science; this is science beyond science. It is the science of God that you should learn. But we are not ready to learn that. We only want what those others have.. Because we have servility in us. Now people from England will come and teach you. I want to ask whether you will only learn then?

Done? So now first you should obtain it. First at least you should attain your powers and then we will see who has obtained what. Now .. you come forward. This question was excellent.

[Another person comes forward with a question but his speech is slurred. Mother asks him to come up on the stage to ask her the question properly, as she is not able to understand what he is saying. In the end, it seems he is just saying - Om Satchitananda. Mother then continues her talk]

Om Satchit Ananda. Satchit Ananda. That is the description of the Aatma (the spirit). I have given at least 10 lectures about this. You should ask for those and listen to them.

Om Satchitaananda. Om - that means the chaitanya [the vibrations]. OM is - A, U, M. These are the 3 powers. Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati. They are the 3 powers of these goddesses that are called A, U and M. And the nasalised vowel on top of it is the Aatma [spirit]. And then Satchitaananda. Sat. Chit. And Ananda. What is Sat [truth] is known through the Spirit. If I say that this statue is Swayambhuv [borne through the earth]. How and why will you believe that? If you get your realisation, then through the Satchitananda, if you go and front your palms in front of the statue, there will be cold vibrations coming from it. And that will be an indication that this is indeed an awakened statue. This power of the Satchitananda is what makes all this work happen. 

Sat Chit Ananda. This is the personality of the spirit.

Just for the sake of it, if you learn some terminology somewhere and repeat it. That is not Sahaja Yoga. First you get the experience, and comprehend it all. It doesn't take too much brain power. You just need to have a heart.

[Mother addresses the young man again]

Is that what you said? Did you say “Om SatChitAnanda”? Very good.

Now another thing I want to say to you is to take off all these hats. One doesn't go to their Mother wearing hats. One has to cross the Sahasrar. Sahasrar has to be crossed; this is where the Kundalini arises from. Please take off your hats. Why do you need hats when you are with your Mother? If you are going to a king, then it is OK. But if you are with your Mother, the first thing she will do is keep her hand on your head. She gives her blessing on your head first, doesn't she?

Keep off your footwear and keep it aside.

[Another person gets up to ask a question]

Now it is done. 99% of people want realisation. Ok. Please ask your question later. I will explain to you afterwards. First get your awakening. Then we will talk. Take off your footwear, because this earth.. We think it is a normal ground. It isn't so. It is a Yoga Bhumi [the land of the Yoga]. Please agree with me on this, and take off your footwear. Please sit cross legged on this floor. Now sit down everyone, why are you all standing? Sit down. Sit down now.. And get your awakening. How much should a Mother explain? I don't understand this. Are you here to stand like a heron [the bird]. Why are you behaving like this? You should be adults about this. Take off your hats and sit down. Or sit on a chair. But sit. You should be a little settled, shouldn't you? 

One should have a pleasant attitude. One should be pleasant. One should have a pleasantly faced attention towards one self. First you should get this power so you will understand what I am saying. How much more are you going to understand before that?

Now both hands like this.. Keep them like this. You should feel the vibrations flowing in these hands. This is the main thing. Now we don’t know about medical science. But the Ida Nadi, or what is named in English as the Left Sympathetic Nervous System, that Nadi flows through this hand (the left hand). And the other... the Pingala Nadi, that of the Sun, that runs through this hand (the right hand). And that is called the Right Sympathetic Nervous System. And Sushumna Nadi runs the Parasympathetic Nervous System. Actually, these Nadis [channels] are subtle and they run these systems. So, the left side is our power of desire. And the right side is the power of action. And it crosses here at the Optic Thalamus. Like so. So the right side goes like this to the left, and the left goes like this here. 

So now to read about this there are books, and there are people to explain all of this. There are very good Sahaja Yogis here in Satara. They know the full knowledge about all of this. They are engineers and its all very nicely maintained. But you should go and ask their address, and ask. It is all going to be free. God doesn't understand money. You should not give him any money. They say that people only come if you take money. What use are such people? They come to God because they give money. Are such people going to be able to do anything?

“Yedya Gabalyaache Kaam Navhe.” 

“It is not something for any random person who is not of a good standing. “

So, Sahaja Yoga is for those people who have self respect. Those who do not have self respect. How will they be able to enter the Kingdom of God? Are we going to set up for beggars there? We are self respecting people. Why should you be giving money to God? God doesn't want money.

Now put the left hand towards me. Meaning... that you desire for this. You have a desire that you should be one with God. That you should have Yoga [union]. As a show of this desire, put the left hand towards me. And the right hand represents the action. So while keeping the left hand towards me, put the right hand towards the ground. So the conditionings within you will be pulled into the earth. Try it. Put the right hand down here on the right side. Simply. Nothing complicated. Just keep it to the side. On one side. Simply. You don't have to press it or anything. Just let it be so. Now see how the vibrations will flow. Left hand towards me. This left hand is your desire. And what is going to stop the desire is the conditionings you have within you. That conditioning should go. This earth is going to pull that out from you. This earth is truly sacred. And so magnificent that She will quickly pull it all out. You should just desire. This is the principle of Ganpati. She will pull out all the negativities within us. See how She pulls out all the conditionings within us. Look at this science. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes and put your attention on the top of your head. Or any other place you want; just let it be. Relaxed. Simple; see how simple this science is. 

You might feel a cool breeze on your left hand. Cool, cool breeze or something like that. Initially hot, and then cool. Your thoughts will altogether stop. Your thoughtlessness immediately manifests. These days, the Kundalini shoots up instantly. Immediately. It doesn't look here or there. It just goes up instantly. Now keep your right hand on top of your scalp. Right hand.. The left you can keep as it was. Keep the right hand like this on top of your hand. Feel it on the top. Is it cool here now? From within the scalp; observe. Is it coming?

Now, out the right hand towards me. Right hand towards me. And the left hand up like this. Today, it will work even if you pray to Dutta. It is a special Dutta Jayanti [birth date of Shri Dattatreya]. Today, I want to make all of you Gurus. It is a very simple act. Right hand towards me, and left hand like this. Now whatever thoughts might be swirling in your head, or what we call futuristic thoughts, and these flights of fancy you will have created for yourself. The Ego, all of it will go into the sky element. This is the science of the five elements; one should learn this well. 

You should feel cold in your hands. If you are feeling cold beneath your hands, then you should transfer it up like this. Like this. You should feel cold in your hands. Again, keep your eyes closed. Observe whether you are having any thoughts. If you are having thoughts, then ask for forgiveness. This is the mantra. I don't want any such thoughts. It is very simple. Now keep your left hand on your head. Open your eyes. Now keep it over your head like this, and ask - is the cool breeze coming out? Observe.

Now, unless you say that you want self realisation, there is nothing I can do. You should say it seven times. Now your right hand. See it again. Is it? Are you feeling cool? Say it out loud. Is it so or not?

Now, put both your hands up. And ask so with your neck leaning back if this is the power of the God. Is this God’s power of love? Is this the chaitanya [vibrations]. Now put your hands down. Now see if you are getting anything cool in your hands. Is it? Say yes, if it is. Are the men feeling it less? Close your eyes now. Everyone. Now put your right hand on the heart. I have to do this in the Western countries. In India, people get their realisation much quicker. But Satara seems to have become modern. Now ask Mataji a question while keeping your hand on your heart. Shri Mataji, Am I the spirit? Ask it three times. Not aloud. Ask it within. 

Now keep your right hand on the left side of your stomach. On the left side, keep your right hand. This is the place of the Guru. The power of the Guru [master] resides here. Now in relation to the Spirit, you should understand that if you are your own spirit, then you also are your own master. So ask: “Mataji, am I my own master?” Repeat it thrice. 

Now place your right hand on the lower side of the left abdominal area. This is the site of pure knowledge. We process all the pure knowledge out from here. This is the Swadhisthan chakra and this is where all the processing of the science of the God happens. Now press your hand there. On the left side, and close your eyes. Now here again... you are independent. So you should ask: “Mataji, please give me pure knowledge.” I cannot force this on you. “Please do give me pure knowledge. Shri Mataji, please do give me pure knowledge.” Repeat this humbly 6 times. And you should be humble about it while asking your Guru, just like you ask your mother for food saying : “Mother, please serve me some food.”

Now once again, move your hand up to the upper side of the left abdomen and press it there. On the left side. On the left side, press your right hand on the upper abdomen. This is where the Guru resides. Now we have to help the Kundalini. Now that you have requested for pure knowledge, the Kundalini has started moving. Now to help her, with full confidence, with self-confidence, you should state that: “Mother, I am my own master.” Now you should repeat this 10 times as there are 10 principles of the Guru. “Mataji, I am my own master.” Say this with self confidence. You are raising your own Kundalini now.

Now raise this hand and place it on the heart. The heart is the place of the spirit. On the left side, from the lower side. The right side, on the left side from the lower side. Like you are holding the heart. Now with full self confidence, you should say that: “Mother, I am the spirit.” Repeat this 12 times as this chakra has 12 subplexuses. Or we call them petals as everything is rather poetic in our language. These are petals of the lotus. “I am the spirit. Shri Mataji, I am the spirit.” You should say this firmly. You verily are. All this superficiality is because of ignorance. Once you have the knowledge, you will know.

Now God is the ocean of love and compassion. But principally, he is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you may have made, or this happened or that. You should not listen to stuff that says you are living in sin or anything like that. You have made no mistakes. You are human, and humans will make mistakes. And God has to forgive your mistakes. And you should realise that he is the god of forgiveness. Thus, take your right hand on the left side between the neck and the shoulder. Forcefully. This is the chakra that is most caught up over here. And this is caught up because of one reason. That I am bad, I have made these mistakes, I am inferior, etc etc.. putting yourself in an inferior position.. And that means this gets caught. And then people get a lot of diseases. So, you should pray that you are not guilty. I have not made any mistakes, Shri Mataji. God is the ocean of compassion and forgiveness. You should say this 16 times. I am not a culprit as I have made no mistakes. You should say so with full confidence. Because this chakra has been caught up very hard.

Now, the right hand should be kept sideways on the forehead. Press it from both sides just like when you press it if you have a headache. Now, this is the Agnya chakra. The mantra on this chakra is that “I have forgiven everyone.” Now people ask me how we should forgive. My dear, you don't really do anything whether you forgive or not. This is just a delusion. But if you don't forgive, then this catches up; so you should sit like this with your hand holding the forehead. And pray that “I have forgiven everyone absolutely.” It doesn't matter how many times, but that you should say it from your heart. “Mother, I forgive everyone altogether.” Press your forehead from both ends. This is a very important chakra.

Now take this hand to the back of your head and press your head very hard. Lean your head back a bit. This is the second portion of the Agnya chakra. Now while not putting any mistakes on yourself or feeling guilty about anything, you should say: “God, if I have made any mistakes, please do forgive me.” That's all. But you should not take any guilt about it. Keep your hand at the back. Everyone should do this. Otherwise, I will not answer any questions. Everyone should do it. Press it hard. It has caught up a lot.

Now the final chakra is the Sahasrar on the top of your skull. So you should open up your palm completely like this. The centre of the palm directly on the top of the skull. Press it. And move it clockwise 7 times like the hands of the clock. And pray humbly that: “Mother, I want my self realisation. Please give it to me.” Say it 7 times.

Now put your hands down and your right hand towards me. There was so much heat in you. Now put your left hand above and see whether you are feeling any cool breeze. We have done so much hard work. It has to come. Right hand towards me and left hand above. Is it cool now? Is it coming... yes. Now it is coming. Now put the left hand towards me and the right hand above. It should be cool emanating from the head. For some it may be hot if their liver is caught up. Right.. Now is it coming.. Good.

Now check again with the left hand. Now put both hands towards me, and observe if you are having any thoughts. Look at me with a thoughtless awareness. Now you don't have any thoughts, do you? This means you have a thoughtless state. The state beyond this is Nirvikalpa [doubtless awareness]. That should be attained, is all. So now are you feeling any cool breeze from your hands? Put your hands up and see if it is cool. Is it? Those who are feeling a cool breeze from their hands or on the top of their heads, please put both your hands up. 

Let's see how many people felt it. See, the whole of Satara has been awakened on this birth anniversary of Dutta. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Very nice.. Now put your hands down.

My Namaskar to all of you. This is very good news. Now all that has happened is that the Kundalini has awakened and it has pierced through. But you should continue with this. Now how many out of this are going to continue and nurture this, I do not know. But please you should respect your own self realisation. You will not understand what this self realisation is if you do not use it. Now if I gave you English money, you will ask me what it is useful for. You should see its use by going into the market. So first, you should understand this wealth that you have received. You should manifest it well so you understand the power that you have been bestowed with. And you will feel verily at peace. You should not debate about this too much. Just be at peace. Just peaceably sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Sit quietly for at least 5 minutes. Do not think too much. You will feel much at peace. Now sit still for at least 2 minutes without looking here or there.

You should be swastha - he who is “stha” in his “swa”. Which means he who is stabilised in his own self. One who has manifested is the person who is swastha. You should not behave like half baked people. You should understand why we behave like this if we have something so precious with us. What has happened to us? You are all yogis now.

Kalpataruche Arnav - [the gems of the wish-fulfilling tree].

Mother speaks to the western yogis asking them to play instrumental music, as it will not generate any thoughts.

These people do not understand our language so they are very happy. They say that Mother, if you speak in Marathi then we can meditate very nicely. So we don't understand what you are saying, so we get into the flow of the vibrations emanating from you. So please do not give us a lecture in English because if you speak in English, then our thoughts start. But if you speak in Marathi, then because of the mantras, the vibrations start flowing, and we get into meditation. So please just speak in Marathi. Now they are learning Marathi. Now at least do not learn this in Marathi from them. At least let that not happen.
