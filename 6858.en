Puja in Adelaide (Australia), 4 March 1983.

So it's very nice to arrive here among all of you and I'm sorry for what has happened before My coming here.  But, as I also told you that nature also can be awakened with the presence of a Divine personality, and once it is awakened it starts behaving in a manner, as a realized soul would do.  Like it gets angry with people who are not religious, people who don't want to know about God, people who are doing wrong things on life, people who are not normal people, in the sense they don't want to be part and parcel of the whole, recluses, all sorts of people.  And once it is brought to that level then it starts working on its own.  

As you know that according to Sahaja Yoga all these elements have got a deity behind it.  For example, agni has got a deity called Agni Devata.  In pure form Agni Devata is the one, which really purifies us.  It purifies everything, it purifies say a gold, if you put gold in the fire it doesn't burn, it comes out more brilliant, better.  But if it is something that is not of such a value it will burn off. 

So all inflammable things are mostly of a low-grade things, which are to be burned only.  But amazingly these lower things only when they are enlightened or you can say, when you put some wood, you take and you put fire to it, so when fire is added to that wood the same fire which is coming, actually the base is that wood itself, it is inflammable, and the flames that are coming out of that fire, once they are enlightened they start knowing what is truth, what is untruth. Or reacting in such a manner as if they know it, what work has to be done.  Now the difference between a Sahaja Yogi and the fire, which is so initiated, is this, that it does not think about it.  It just goes on completely finishing things, which it has to do.  And by a method of frequencies it knows where to go and which one to burn off.  And that's how it goes on burning things, which it has to burn.  

And some of the unfortunate things are that people feel that this fire has no compassion and that the fire must have some compassion also to spare some people.  But the trouble is we must understand that we have so many things within us.  We've got fire, we've got water, we've got Mother Earth all elements are within us.  But in the fire - it is only the fire element, nothing else.  So it acts according to its own quality, that is fire.  And whatever is the quality of the fire when enlightened, separates truth from untruth and starts behaving in that manner, but it remains fire.  It cannot become compassion.  But in a way if you see, when you start choosing between the wrong type of a person and a right type of a person if you see in a subtle way it is compassion because it is truth, and truth is love.  So whatever it is doing is to manifest the love of God, and when it is manifesting the love of God you should know, that though it is fire it gets the performance of a personality, which is as if, is a human being.  Because it is discreet.  It knows what to burn and what not to burn.

One day I must tell you, we were doing some sort of a cleaning of the doors with those lamps you get and Linda one day you see by mistake, brought that lamp very close to My body and the lamp, the flame was very strong, but it just went round Me, didn't touch Me.  She was surprised, she said, " Mother You're burning." I said, "Don't worry," it just went round and came out.  So the fire doesn't burn a person who is pure, doesn't burn.  The example is Sitaji.  Sitaji when She was brought by Shri Rama from Ravana's place, you see, everybody said that She has lived with a Rakasha and She must be found out whether She is guilty or not.  So Rama first of all He said, "All right," He put the fire.  She Herself said that, "You put a fire, a big pyre of fire," and She sat on that.  And when the fire started burning it could not burn Her, She could not be burnt, you see, and the whole fire subsided. 

So that time the Agni Devata knows what is right, what is wrong.  Who is holy, who is unholy.  But human beings take lot of time to recognize that and to understand, even in Sahaja Yoga, because the sensitivity has to be grown much more.  Now why is it, that anything that like water, or Agni or any one of these elements become so sensitive than human beings are.  How they just obediently do the thing, as if they know the job and they're so quick at it, so efficient.

The reason is they are completely under the control of the Divine.  They are under the control of the powers of God, absolutely, hundred percent.  Whatever God wants, they do it, once they are enlightened.  But human beings are still, you see, dwindling between his own human awareness and the Divine awareness and the oneness with God.  So it is the sensitivity in a person grows very, very, slowly - doesn't matter makes no difference - and when it grows, it comes you see it moves sometimes, two steps forwards and five steps backwards, you see again like that.  When the time is about two years, you'll find a gentleman at the same spot where he started.  You get quite upset at how it has happened, despite Sahaja Yoga.  But this is the thing is, that human beings can think, and they can decide, and they have ultimate freedom to give up this sensitivity at any time.  So you have to be under complete obedience of the Divine, which is, one cannot understand sometimes how to be like that because we have not been brought up that way.  We don't know how to do it and it's very difficult.  

So many people say, "Mother it's very difficult to surrender."  It's not that they don't want to surrender, but they think that, "We are still you see, there is still ego popping up somewhere, Mother says something but we start questioning her.  Mother says this, then we think that we should, we can suggest to Mother there's another alternative and this and that."  But there's no alternative, there's no alternative for a person who's a sensible person.

If he knows that Divine is only thinking of your hitha, of your well-being, and whatever it sees and does, you see, knows much more than you, much much more.  And in so many dimensions that, if somebody says so that, "Do like this," best is to do that.  Sometimes it shocks people.  People have ideas about sympathies, ideas about being, you see, kind to others, and compassionate to others.  But what is a human compassion, it doesn't do anything it just talks.  While the God's compassion works, it works.  It works on people, it doesn't talk that, "Oh, I'm very compassionate, I'm full of compassion," nothing, it just works, it manifests itself.  So one should understand to be a complete ego-less personality, one should try to obey the Self within yourself.

Now how do you obey yourself within yourself?  It is through vibratory awareness.  Try to obey through your vibratory awareness.  Any question you want to ask, anything you want to do, you must obey it through your vibratory awareness.  Now some people are not so sensitive, that's true.  The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it.  Now you think with your brain, all right? If your brain can be enlightened, then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will improve, because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system.  Now in the central nervous system if there is any blockage it is actually in the brain because all the centers are represented in the brain.  

So the best thing is to say that, "Mother come in my brain.  Please reside in my brain.  Please make Your room in this brain.  You be the controller of this brain.  Let this brain be guided by Your divine wisdom."  And you don't think for yourself, and this word 'I think' should be dropped completely from Sahaja Yogis.  'I think' means, goes on you see, in funny ways; it can be anything, you see.  Like once we went out and we had one of my very stupid relations staying with us, a girl.  And as I was going out - we had no servants that day, so I was cooking - but that day when we were going out I said to her, "I'm going in the morning, so can you make a little bit of kedgeree for us and when we come back we'll have it."  That's the only cooking she did in her lifetime, maybe she did not do also.  So when we came back she told Me that she has not cooked.  So I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook, because we were supposed to take our food here."  She said, "I thought that maybe you may not come.  Maybe you're not hungry, maybe you may not like to eat.  Maybe I may not cook well," you see, all these four alternatives not to do the cooking.  But I said, "Why didn't you think that we may be hungry, that we will eat. Why didn't you think this way?"

"But I thought," you see this is an explanation for not having one in the brain I should say, that there is no Divine guidance in the brain.  Then the guidance comes from your ego or from your superego, which says, "I thought that this might happen."  But how, why, why did you think like that?  Why not the other way round?  Why didn't you think the other way round?  But that is how it is, and when these things happen we really are so much used to this kind of justification and alternatives to be offered, that this becomes again the habit of the brain and the brain gets separated from the Divine.  So you tell your brain, "But why, why did you think like that?  Now will you stop thinking about these things on these lines?  Let us think of the positive thinking."  

Now positive thinking is nothing but is thinking - as according to Sahaja Yoga, is not aggressive thinking, but it means that a thinking which helps to manifest the Divine.  That is what is positive thinking.  And the result of that is that your nerves start opening out, and you start feeling the manifestations of divine power in your fingers in your being.  And this is the basic thing that doesn't happen in the West or in the Western culture because we have a very big idea of always giving an explanation for anything.  Now you can see that, supposing you go to a person who is possessed and you get possessed, then you'll give an explanation you see, I went to that person thinking, I thought, that I would cure that person.  But the result is that you are mad now.  Instead of that person getting cured you have (inaudible).

So what is the reason?  The reason is that you thought in a very negative way, that, "I thought that this would help me or I was helping that person," on the contrary you got into trouble.  Now the trouble did not think, no, it just entered into you without thinking.  It is there, it never thought "whether I enter this person or not," it just came in, walked straight forward.  While you were busy thinking, you see, it entered into your being and settled down there.  So it's like a thief walking into your house nicely when you are busy, absentmindedly doing something, you see, it's exactly like this.  You see the thief walking in suddenly you find Oh, the thief is standing behind you - now you said, "I was thinking." 

 Is exactly the same way it happens to us and when we know, our mind knows, that "I can give an explanation about it."  Every time it is ready to give explanation then the mind, you see, is used to that kind of a phenomenon, that it will always give an excuse, always it will say something.  So it is never on the alert, because you see, even if the trouble walks into you, you'll always say "this is the explanation."  But explanation doesn't cure, doesn't help you.  Because by mental explanation - (DELETE Lady coughing. she's not well, give her some soothing things. Yogi also speaks)...

So one should not be extremely on the thought waves and on depending on their thinking because, you see, thinking has an alternative.  Thinking always has an alternative.  You can say, " I was thinking this, or I was thinking that."  But whom are you blaming?  It was you who were thinking so you are responsible for that.  So if you take the responsibility for your thinking, then you may not do such a thing as to say that, "I thought, if I had done this thing it would have been better," because you are responsible for your thinking.  Supposing an engine driver decides that "I thought I better go by the other route," and has a big accident.  People will ask him, "Why did you think like that?  What was the thing that made you think like that?"  But in everyday to day life I find human beings are always saying, "I think, I think, I think," all the time giving alternatives and that's why they go up and down, up and down, up and down like that.

But for fire, or for water, or for Mother Earth there is no alternative, no more alternative.  If I just touch the Mother Earth and I say, "Suck in their problems please," She just sucks them in.  If I tell the fire, "Now come along you have been ignited."  I don't even tell, I don't even tell, they immediately suck in.  Their Kundalini rises you can say.  You put a fire in front of My photograph it's vibrated, you put a light it's vibrated, it has no alternatives.  It doesn't think it has no alternatives, it's just enlightened, it has its own quality of enlightenment in the purest sense, because thinking makes it impure.  Your enlightenment becomes impure by your thinking, by giving explanations, by giving all these nonsensical alternatives.  So one should know with the Divine there is no alternative.  In Sanskrit the word is pariyai (Spelling?), there is no pariyai for Divine instrument.  There's nothing like that.  Supposing you don't want to accept it, you'll have problems and then you'll say that,  "Mother  how did we have problems?"

As you saw in Delhi, I told these people many a times that, "Please do not have any program for eight days and let all these people stay with some friends."  They wouldn't listen to me.  They're in the program in that flat business and they were thinking they will have a big pendal in which they'll give them the food to eat and all that.  But you know what happened, it rained, and rained, and rained.  Now rain knew what I wanted, because it had to rain for the rabbi crop, you see, I have to look after the whole universe.  And that's why I said, "That for these eight days don't allow them to stay in this because it will be difficult for them to move out, better keep them with some other people so they can carry them along and all that.  But they did not, you see.  Ultimately it turned out to be a fiasco. They had to arrange for the stay of all other people into some houses.  So this is this situation.

Now they might say that, "Mother, You better stop the rain."  I will not.  Because it is, they must know that the question of rabi crop is also equally important for Me and they have to have their share.  After all they are human beings and they are to be helped.  But why didn't you listen to Me?  And then he came to Me and he said that, "Mother will you please stop the rain tomorrow?"  I said, "All right, tomorrow I will."  Went back and he told the other gentleman, he said that, "Let's put up the (inaudible), let's put up pendal and let the, let us cook there."  He said, "But no it will rain."  He said, "No, it will not because I've told God Himself."  He said, "Where did you meet God?"  He said, "I did meet Her, and now it's done."  

Next day was, he got up at five o'clock the other fellow and he saw the whole sky so clear and he said, "Look at that.  You have told God and God has listened to you."  So this is it, then when you are that much one with God, I mean if you tell anything it will work out.  Anything you ask for it will work out.  But we are not, we are always finding alternatives, you see.  And these alternatives is a game, all these people have played with you, all the time giving you alternatives.  See now, in the market if you go, just now I asked him about how, what car you have.  So he told me there are so many combinations, this that, cylinder this that, so you go mad.  "All right Baba, give me something, whatever it is."  And then you see they, this is all playing with your brains all the time giving you alternatives, whether you want this or that.

And you feel that you are really a great personality that you can decide about "I'll have this color and that thing," very seriously people do it.  Even I've seen, you see, in a dinner if people are sitting in a hotel or something, they'll study all the menu very carefully and anyone of them will say, "All right I'll have this," the other fellow will say, "I'll have that"  And the bearer is quite puzzled but owners are happy that they have befooled you completely.  They just mix up this with that, "Oh this is this, this is this," and just they try to befool, you see.  Everything is boiled, kept there, all right, this is the choice, this with masala, this with masala, it's all ready.  You see, just mix that, put it before you, "Oh I've got very good this thing..."  It's not, it's not that your Spirit is happy with it, it's not even your stomach that is happy with it, it's not even your palette that is happy with you, it's only your brain, this ego is happy.  And you say. "Oh, very nice, oh."  Still it's not good.

Same thing with gurus it happens like that.  That you see they pay for the guru, all right, so now the satisfaction is "I have paid for the guru."  And when you go there, even they feel the scorpion is pinching them, you see, all the time is biting.  You say, "What happened?"  "No, no, it's all right, nothing has gone wrong." And they continue with it,  "Oh I'm very quiet.  Yes I'm all right, I'm very peaceful, I'm never agitated, I'm absolutely relaxed."  And you can see his nose is jumping, his eyes are jumping, his head is jumping and he is supposed to be the most relaxed person.  "Oh, I felt very peaceful, very happy, no doubt." How can you?  With bhoots, how can you?  I mean I know you cannot but I've seen many people telling Me this story, oh they felt very nice with the guru and they felt very peaceful with the guru, and then you become dishonest.  Just to support that guru one becomes dishonest.

So we come back to the same point, that all these elements are honest, they're absolutely honest.  Whatever is their quality they profess that.  A fire will not say that, "I will cool you down," it will not say.  But after realization so many of you must have noticed that if you put your hands to the fire you'll get cool breeze coming out of it. Because it burns away whatever is ugly, whatever is bad in you, and you'll get the cool breeze from everywhere then, because that part is burnt away.  It does the work of burning away and when it burns away then you put a hand towards the fire and you are surprised that from the flame the cool is coming out.  Instead of burning me, how the flame is cooling me.  So the quality, whatever they represent, they have within themselves built-in and they are honest.  They are not dishonest, because they are absolutely one with the divine laws.  But human beings are not like that they play tricks here, there, that.  That's why to give realization to human beings is a very difficult thing.

Now I'll also tell you about the swayambhu things that come out of Mother Earth.  You see the Mother Earth sends out certain forms above Her being for you people to see that there are vibrations.  To work out Her spiritual thing by which She makes the spirituality emit among you, by which She guides you, by which She creates a nucleus for you to worship and this work She does in a very honest manner.  But when such a swayambhu - things comes out, you can't understand why people are attracted to it.  So then you become a sort of, in charge of that thing.  Then you want to make artificial images of that, it's human nature, to make everything that you see real, make it artificial.  And that goes on and on and on, till human beings themselves become so identified with their artificiality that they don't understand what reality is.  In reality whatever you are, you are the highest.  

You are the highest epitome of all the creatures.  Even the thing that comes out of the Mother Earth cannot do the work that you can.  It cannot raise the Kundalini, it cannot, no maybe a little bit, effects might be, but it won't work out with that force with that maneuvering I mean you are like a very advanced machinery of God's work, very advanced, extremely sharp, and extremely effective.  And the problem is this brain of yours, you see, when it comes in between, which is nothing compared to that big brain, you see.  Your brain is nothing but like a little mosquito, it comes up, comes here and there, says, "Oh, this, this, this, this, this" and then the problem starts.  But if you really start using this power with in you, God has made you as the best instrument that you could think.  And as you start using your instrument with that wisdom and surrender or humility, gradually it evolves more and more and more, and you start developing more sensitive sides, or we can say evolving a new method in this and getting a better and better understanding of the working of Sahaja Yoga.  

So it is important that first of all you must decide to stop the brain working too much and say that "Mother You be in our brain."  Thank God I'm before you in person, it's not difficult.  Just say that "Mother, You have to be in our brain."  Now this brain is as you know, is supported by the five elements, they all are in this brain and if you can somehow or other bring Me in that brain, somehow or other, by telling your brain, now, not to disturb you any more, you'll be amazed that immediately the whole system will start working like a dynamo.  It will be such a sensitive thing, you don't have worry about anything, don't have to think about anything.  You touch anything it becomes gold sort of thing, you see becomes Midas' touch, becomes such a great thing.  But that, to achieve, is difficult for human beings.  They find it difficult to achieve that kind of a perfection where you lose completely your ego and you become egoless. 

 Like the fire, the Mother Earth, like all other elements - they have no ego.  It's only human beings who have built the ego.  And the ego is such a big myth.  Because when you don't do anything, why should you think you are doing something, and why should you be responsible for doing anything?  But the thing is, we think that, "No it's not God, we have to do this thing," and  "I have to decide." You see it's just we play tricks with ourselves morning till evening spoiling our brain, absolutely becoming mad. Best thing is to surrender and see the things will come before you, you'll be amazed, oh, how it has happened, how it has worked out.

  The other day I told just Kerry, "You better go and register yourself."  She said, "Mother the university has closed down these days, I can't get into it, it's very difficult."  I said, "All right I've said it, you go."  Then she telephoned, they said, "It's impossible, you just can't do it but if you want you can come and see."  And as she walked into the university in the office they said, "All right, come along you are registered."  It is, so many times it will happen to you people.  But it took about ten minutes for Me to convince her that you just try it.  But I must say still she was not so adamant she was thinking, " If Mother is saying, I may get it this thing, it will work out."  

But if you suppose, "It's all right, Mother You are saying, I'm just going to register, finished."  Then what happens even if you do not get registered doesn't matter. That's not important. Your brain improves. That's important, that your brain improves, it becomes more sensitive.  It's not important that the work should be done, that's not important.  What is important that in you brain you must get this idea that "Let me be enlightened, truly."  All right?  This is what one has to understand, in a very subtle way that we all are very sensitive instruments made by God and all our energies are not yet working.  So we have to supply energy to all our nerves and that's only possible if we remove our blockages created by our ego and by our conditioning.  If you can remove the blockages, all our nerves will become very sensitive.  And that's why, tell your mind that, "Now any further, you better put Mother down there."

Now it is also expressed through the way you talk you see, you jabber, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab and nothing I've seen you jabbering and  I say, all right, now?  There is nothing to talk about, there's nothing to say about it, it's just there and if it's just there then it is better to be done and to be executed, and it will work out.  Because if you know how to talk too much then it's difficult, it's going to be difficult.  Because you'll not suck in anything within yourself, and you'll always give explanations, you'll always say, "Oh, maybe I thought, maybe this, maybe that."

  A simple example, say for example I say, "Oh, think I brought -" If I say I think I brought, I mean something with it.  I say, "I've brought my chappals with me."  The other person, "No, I think..." finished.  

May not be true, I may not be true at all when I'm saying that, you see, I may be saying it just to test you.  And to say maybe "Then, let's see, all right." Try.  Once or twice you say, that whatever you know so far you say must be, if Mother says so, must be, just try to train your mind that way.  I tried these tricks and I find mostly they fail, then I give up. Mostly they failed and they just can't understand how these things happen, and how what Mother says comes true and how that thing works out this way and... 

 But now understand that, I am just playing tricks with you, just to make you understand that put your mind absolutely at rest and let the big Ahamkara, the Mahat Ahamkara take over, the Mahat ego, the great ego of God take over and you'll get it, all right? May God bless you.

 It's better now, I think the brain activity has stopped quite a lot.  So now what should we do, now what is the theme as you asked me now, I don't know...

You see, by washing My feet what you are doing is that you are awakening the Spirit in the water, first of all. And when you decorate My feet what you do is that you decorate the powers that are there and when you put those red things on.....
