Advice to Brides, Bordi (India), 12 February 1984.

Into a married life and, and you have been virgin so far and now you have to enter into another life of marriage and is a great responsibility on all of you to see that you make your marriages successful. And you have to see that you behave in such a manner that you create a proper motherhood within yourself and a discipline that you want your children to imbibe and your husband to have. You have seen your mother, own Mother has been sitting for 9-10 hours, sometimes, at one place, not even getting out of this place. But I have seen people that they can't sit for two hours in a place, even if they are meditating [unclear]. And they will get up, disturb everybody else and get down. It's a sign that we lack in our discipline. That our parents did not discipline us. That we did not discipline ourselves. So now first thing is that you have to have a perfect discipline of your temperament and is a sign that you are the people who represents this Mother Earth, who has a special wisdom and a special power to express that wisdom. 


So all of you have to be extremely careful that whatever you do will be reflected in the whole family and in the whole Sahaja Yoga system. Now when you get married to your husbands try to understand that you are the mother earth. And you have to give and because you have powers you can give. Because you have so many shaktis within you, you have to give. That means you are superior in a way that you can give. So that your ego should not stand up at all the time and say why should I do, why should I. And then you will start enjoying this womanhood. 


So try to be good mothers, good wives and responsible Sahaja Yogis. Those who after marriage, try to deviate their husbands from Sahaja Yoga are really the most cursed ones. You should have sweet tongue for others, should be careful what you talk, you have to be responsible, you are special people that you are married in Sahaja Yoga. I hope you will keep this in mind.
