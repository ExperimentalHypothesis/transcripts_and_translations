[Yogis waiting for Shri Mataji]

[Shri Mataji arrived]

[Yogis giving flowers to Shri Mataji]

Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is "Welcoming letter" from our prime minister

Yogi: I am sure Shri Mataji you will get it peace award, we all pray for it

Shri Mataji: They were really very open, and Mr.Shrivastava talked to them, that is what we want, all the superficiality is useless, Mr Shrivastava said to me nobody done work like you around the world. It was a big surprise for them that it could be achieved in a peaceful way. At the end of this month, it will be done; it showed on TV that peace award will be giving this month. There is another fellow, that Chinese boy, he tried to create a revolution, and in Hong Kong, many people reacted. That many young people can die. Even if you get democracy, how you can enjoy it?

Yogi: Once you get a peace award, we will all have parties.

Shri Mataji: It will be a good thing, because even now so many things going I really shocked, like Belgium, Holland. Now about priests, so many priests are stupid. One priest runs away in England, can't understand this madness. It's like a disease. The worst was I think Belgium, very bad. Small, small girl has been murdered. Politicians are really ashamed. First I was in Italy so they all got exposed, half of them are in jail, and in India, the same thing is very sad. They have no social ideas they have no worries, what are they going to do? And all the times they are playing tricks here and there.
