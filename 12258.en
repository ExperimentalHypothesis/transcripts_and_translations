Guru Nanaka Jayanti, Noida residence, India, 13/11/2008

They didn’t talk of Kundalini, that is the only trouble. And they all, that time they were all fighting. Because of that fighting nature nobody had the patience to tell them: "Baba! You don’t fight now, it's a bouddism [unsure]." Because when there is fight going on, you can’t talk to them!
But with Sahaj Yoga [cut in the video]
And there was no fighting.
Sahaj Yoga is given you a complete freedom but as Sahaja is a complete-
Shri Mataji [to a girl]: Darling?
Girl: Surein? Surein is not coming.
Shri Mataji: Come here [inaudible. Hindi]
Baba [Hindi] Ha.
Girl: Surein?
Shri Mataji: [Speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: There have been very great gurus.
Girl: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Very great.
But that time, everybody was quarelling. Nobody was listening and they were all fighting. [Hindi]
So they never talked about basic, is the Kundalini. This is the trouble. And then, above all this, they were not friendly with each other. This is the problem, that's why they faught. And now, they didn't talk of Kundalini and Self-realization. They were all very eminent, but because of this gap, the problem became wider and wider.

None of them talked of Kundalini, can you imagine? They said it is- some mentionned about it in Sanscrit language, but have not seen everything. So they all knew the same thing but they didn’t say. So, so many got separated. And there was a big rift within each other. Because the truth was, there is a Kundalini. And this was not said critically.

[Hindi]
Now we have started going to school. [Shri Mataji is smiling looking at children]
[Hindi: Please look out. we will tie up that NOT CLEAR and very wise very wise Their morning starts now. [Shri Mataji pointing to a child] and these grown-ups they always stand first in their class]

Shri Mataji: [Unclear. In Hindi]

First Canada, then Russia.
Canada I have not been and they have been waiting and waiting. they sent six people to invite Me. But I just couldn’t go there. But I must go to Canada.
Just about a week, I will stay there.
[In Hindi] After that, where have I to go?
Sir C.P: Russia.
Shri Mataji: [In Hindi, after that] Russia.
Sir C.P: Russians are very keen, very, very keen.
Shri Mataji : [In Hindi, So what we have to do?]
Sir C.P: Russians are very very keen. They want very much. They have been praying to you to come to Russia.
Shri Mataji: Yes! Yes Russians are! Russians are extremely keen, very keen. And they are great Sahaja Yogis. Now what is happening, it is a [unclear] nation there. They want to work out and have a way, not Communism. But I told them that: "Now your communism is internal. So every part of it is internal." They are all communists. But now the thing is, it has to bring Sahaja Yoga. After communism, they have to bring Sahaja Yoga because in communism if there are some extraordinary people, extra sensory people, you cannot- they cannot come out. But after they seek, they take to Sahaja Yoga, then all such people who are at midpoint, they'll come out.
In every country, there are very remarkable people and very talented and great understanding. Every country has. But the only thing is, I have to meet all of them and I have to go to all these countries. So, now the only thing is that I cannot go to all the countries but I can do to two countries at least, ne?
Sir C. P to Shri Mataji: You know, the President of Russia has- President of Russia, mister Medvedev has taken Self-realization from a Sahaja Yogi.
Shri Mataji: Yes. End is Russia. First I will go to Canada. Canadians have been trying but somehow, I could not go. Canada is little far away. So, I couldn’t do that.
But now I have to go to Canada at any cost, and then to Russia. That I cannot have now. But, there is some work here that has to be done.

Sir CP: And a great musician.
Shri Mataji: She is very good at music. and she writes poems and she gives tunes to Varada. She is very capable. We have all kinds of experts and I know, they will come up and spread Sahaja Yoga. They can.
Now there won’t be any mistake. Even Guru Nanak could not say much about Sahaja Yoga. In a way, he has spoken, but nothing clear. But now, you are clearer about it and you know what is Sahaj and how it can help the whole world, can solve the problems of the whole world.
Of course, whatever problems you have, please write it down and give it to Me. I would like to attend to it.
