 परिचय : स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र एक उपग्रह की तरह नाभी चक्र से जुडा भवसागर के चारो तरफ घूमता है तथा उसके दस पन्खुडियों को (जो दस गुरुओं के उपदेश के प्रतीक है ) आधार देता है। जब कुन्डलिनी शक्ति जागृत होती है तो पहले नाभी चक्र से गुजरती है और बाद में स्वाधिष्ठान से गुजरती है और वहाँ से वापस नाभी चक्र से होकर अपना सफर सहस्त्रार तक तंय करती है। उत्क्रान्ति के दौरान मानव ने शरणस्थल की इच्छा को घर बनाने मे परिवर्तित किया। मानव की सौन्दर्य शक्ति निरन्तर बढ़ती रही है और अपने शरणस्थल (घर) को अधिकाधिक आधुनिक स्वरुप देने लगा | फलस्वरूप सौभाग्य से वास्तुकला शास्त्र का निर्माण हुआ। उसकी यही सृजनशीलता (creativity) बढकर अमूर्त स्वरुप लेने लगी, जहाँ वह सोचने लगा, उसे प्रकाशित करने लगा और उसकी छवि बनाने लगा जिसका इससे पहले वस्तुस्वरुप मे कोई भी मेल नहीं मिलता था। इसी उगते हुए सौन्दर्य शासत्र से रचनात्मक कला की उत्पति हुई। में D गुण : स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र का मूलभूत गुण है सृजनशीलता । यही से सृजनशीलता के लिए उज्जा उत्पन्न होती है। अपने आत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद हम जानने लगते है कि सृजनशीलता को पाने का सच्चा मार्ग हैं अपने ध्यान में निर्विचार समाधी प्राप्त करना। इसी से हम जानने लगते है कि सृजनशीलता का सौदर्य हमारे अन्दर एक स्तब्ध तथा शान्त तालाब की तरह है। जब हम उस तालाब को खोज निकालते हैं तो हम उसका माध्यम बन जाते हैं। हम इस सामूहिक अन्त: मन का सृजन साधन बन जाते है जिसमे अहंकार नहीं होता जो इस कला के शुध्दता को प्रदूषित करे। कवि वर्डवर्थ के अनुसार, "यह एक हृदय, जो देखता है और ग्रहण करता है"। सृजनशीलता की हर एक विधि स्वाधिष्ठान के गुणों से ही संचालित होती है। अगर यह क्रिया संतुलन मे प्राप्त की गयी (सूक्ष्म यन्त्रना के सुषुम्ना मार्ग से) तो फलस्वरुप अध्यात्मिक उन्लति होती है और हम कह सकते है कि यह हृदय से बनी थी। आत्म-साक्षात्कार के बाद इस बातपर जोर दिया जाता है और फलस्वरुप एक सृजनप्रेरित कार्य हो जाता है। पुराने कलाकार जैसे मोझार्ट और माइकेल अन्जोलो जो की जन्म से आत्मसाक्षात्कारी थे, उनका सौन्दर्य अभिरुचिपूर्ण कार्य हमे यही चीज दर्शाता है । इस गुनवत्ता का कार्य अमर होता है जो हमे आनंद तथा सौन्द्रर्य प्रदान करता है जो कि सम्पूर्ण युग को दर्शाता है । लेकिन इस आधुनिक कार्यपद्धति मे यह अकसर देखा गया है की जो कलाकार शुरू मे हदय से कार्य करते है, उनकी प्रवृत्ति कुछ इस तरह बन जाती है कि वो आगे चलकर निर्जीव, उथला तथा शोषण करने वाला कार्य करते हैं। इस प्रवृत्ति का मूलभूत कारण है, कलाकार का अहंकार। जैसे जैसे कलाकर यशस्वी होने लगता है वो अधिक परिश्वम करता है जिससे उसकी यशस्विता बरकरार रहे। इसके लिये उसे बाईने नाडी का (पिंगला नाडी या कार्य नाडी) बहुत ज्यादा इस्तेमाल आवश्यक हो जाता है। फलस्वरुप इस नाडी के अत्याधिक तनावपूर्ण उपयोग से कलाकार के अहंकार का गुब्बारा बहुत फूल जाता है। ध्यान दीजीए कि मानव के सूक्ष्म यन्त्र में अहंकार पिंगला नाडी या कार्यशक्ति के अन्त मे सिर के दाहिने बाजू मे एक गुब्बारे के आकार मे स्थित है। जैसे जैसे कलाकारयह सोचने लगता है कि वही संपूर्णत: कला का निर्माता है (दैवी प्रेरणा को भूला देता है) तो यह प्रक्रिया बढने लगती है, अहंकार बढ़ता जाता है, और अन्तता उस के कला से अध्याति्मिकता का अंश संपूर्णत : नष्ट हो जाता है। आत्मा जो हमारे हृदय में विराजमान है, वही सृजनता का वास्तविक स्त्रीत है और कलाकार और अन्य लोग जो बहुत सोचते हैं, नाम तथा शोहरत के पीछे भागते है, उनका स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र कमजोर पड जाता है और वे एक असन्तुलित व्यक्ति बन जाते है। दुसरो की अपेक्षा श्रेष्ठ बनने की अभिलाषा दूसरो से अपने गुण की प्रशंसा की महत्वाकांक्षा उनके अहंकार से आती है जो कि पिंगला नाडी व्हारा स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र के दाहिने तरफ से जुडा हुआ है । इस महत्वाकांक्षी तथा स्पर्धात्मक सृजनशीलता के कारण उनकी सहजता लुप्त हो जाती है। इसी से यह स्पष्ट होता है कि आधुनिक कलाकृतियाँ मे चेतना, हृदयता तथा अत्मिक पहलूओ की कमी क्यो होती है। "The function of the liver is to absorb all the poison of the body and convert it into heat, which passes through the blood stream when you start thinking, too much you neglect your liver and then the poor thing does not know how to do this job. So the whole is saturated in the stomach. The person has heat here, then the heat starts passing upwards through the right heart. It creates problem and that problem is called Asthma. Then this heat passes into the throat, which creates a 2

 kind of a cold where you will sneeze twenty times in the morning. There are two types of liver. One is lethargic liver and the other is overactive liver. I am talking of the over active liver, where a person develops cold, sneezing, temper, anger, acidity and tension. Then this heat passes over and can go to the heart at a very young age. Supposing there are boys who are playing tennis or exercise of a vigorous nature and drinking this might affect and can cause a massive heart attack at a very young age. The same heat when it passes to the throat we develop throat trouble, hoarseness etc. when it moves down to your pancreas then the poor pancreas is also suffering because it has no energy from the center. Then a person develops diabetes. Too much of thinking gives diabetes. People think too much, sugar gives diabetes. In Maharashtra people drink tea where sugar is so much that the spoon stand up. Nobody gets diabetes because they are villagers, living simple lives, not thinking of tomorrow, how to do this or that. Only the people lives simple, not thinking of tomorrow, how to do this or that. Only the people who are sitting on their seats, planning thinking, worrying gets diabetes..." (Doctor's Conference, Meridian Hotel, Delhi, 25.03.93) परम्परा: स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र पर साक्षात श्री ब्रम्हाजी विराजमान है । वे मूलभुत निर्माता को दर्शाते है तथा उनकी शक्ति श्री सरस्वती जो कला तथा संगीत की देवी कहलाती है। स्थूल भौतिक पहलू : इस चक्र का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण कार्य है अपने पेट के चरबी को मस्तिष्क के भूरे तथा सफेद कोशिकओं मे परिवर्तित करना जो हमारे विचारो में लगने वाले शक्ति के लिये ईन्धन का कार्यकरता है। अति वैचारिक्ता और अति पूर्वयोजना इस क्रिया को अतिकार्यशील करते हैं जिससे यह चक्र का जरूरत से ज्यादा उपयोग होता है। स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र यकृत (लिवर) का भी कार्य नियमन (नाभी चक्र के साथ मिलकर) करता है। अगर इस चक्र को अति विचारों के लिए कार्य करना पड़े तो दूसरे अंग जो इसके द्वारा नियन्त्रित है उपेक्षित हो जाते है । इस उपेक्षा का प्रभाव यक्ृत पर सबसे ज्यादा पडता है । इस चक्र की बाधाए हमारे दाहिने हाथ के अगूठे तथा बीच के उंगुली पर फडकन, झनझनाहट और हाथ पर चुभन के रूप मे महसूश होती है। हमारे यकृत का इसमे अलग महत्व है क्योकि यही हमारे चित्त का पीठ है। चित्त और विचारो के भेद मे भ्रमित नही होना चाहिए । विचार तो हमारे अहंकार से और प्रतिअहंकार (हमारे पुराने संसकार तथा परिस्थितियों) से आते है। और चित्त शुध्द एकाग्रता है जो विचार तथा मस्तिष्क के कार्योके बिना है, उदाहरण के तौर पर जब हम फूल की तरफ देखते है तो अपना चित्त उस पर डालते है (साक्षी स्वरुप मे) लेकिन हम उसके बारे मे विचार नहीं करते हैं। चित्त विचारों से संलग्नित नहीं होता, वह शुद्ध एकाग्रता और साक्षीभाव से देखना मात्र है । एक संतुलित यकृत हमारे चित्त को सम्भालता तथा पोषित करता है। वह बाहरी बाधाओं और अशुध्दयों को छान कर उसे शुद्ध रखता है और इसी शुध्दित चित्त से शान्ति तथा स्थिरता हमारे ध्यान के दौरान हमें प्राप्त होती है। हमारा यकृत अतितापित होने पर ( मद्यपान , उत्तेजक पदार्थ सेवन से) बहुत संवेदनशील बनता है जिसका विपरीत प्रभाव हमारे चित्त पर होता है और हमारा ध्यान कमजोर हो जाता है। "The third thing which is even more dangerous is the speed. Nowadays life is so funny that it cannot be congenial to the working of the Spirit. What happens in the morning is that one reads the newspapers, horrible news, Bombay blast, etc., the spleen start wobbling. Then you don't eat your breakfast properly. You rush to work, cursing the people on the way because of the traffic jam. This craziness makes it vulnerable to blood cancer. The spleen does not know how to react to this craziness. Then a shock will happen on the left side because you are working on the right side and then it fails. The connection with the whole is lost. The brain cannot control anymore. Then this trouble of leukemia comes in. Then it goes to kidney. You cannot pass urine. Then he is put on dialysis and poor man dies bankrupt. Dialysis has not cured anyone so far. It just makes them live

 longer and longer. Sometimnes you don't feel hungry because of the liver plus you feel constipated. Constipation can be of the worst kind where all their lives they have to take enemas. These are the common diseases faced by the over active people.

 YAS HIMALAY A SAHAJA INSIGHT It is said that meditating on the Himalayas brings liberation in the form of true knowledge dispelling the darkness of ignorance and helps attain a pure state of the ultimate and not just the seat of the wise and source of waters that keep life, but the very fountainhead of 'Sumati' and 'Smriti' or knowledge and cognitive memory, As a proverb it is said, just as dew disappears with the morning sun, all sins get washed away at the very sight of the magnificent Himalayas. The whole of the Himalayas are viewed as the abode of Lord Shiva. He rests in different forms on these mountains with Mount Kailash being his permanent residence. He even married the daughter of the king of the Himalayan Mountains, 'Sati' or 'Himavati' or the Daughter of Snow. There are innumerable stories related and buried deep into these mystic snow white peaks of divine creation of Divine the Himalayas. It is said once the Pandavas, the five heroic brothers of the epic, Mahabharata, visited the Lord here in these recesses of mountain. When Lord Shiva saw them coming he, however, changed his form into one of a buffalo and tried to run away. The five brothers managed to get hold of him, but only his posterior. It is believed that in Kedaradesa only the posterior part of the Lord remains. His body was separated into five parts and spread all over the Himalayas and these five sites are together known as "Pancha Kendaras". The path to heaven is said to run up the Himalayas. Yudhishtra, of the Mahabharata, is said to have climbed these peaks in his progress towards heaven the one leading to the heavens is called "Swargarohini", where Swarga means heaven "Arohini" means ascent. Chomolungma is the "Goddess Mother of the earth" in Tibetan. Romel Verma, Shri Mataji's SonIn law, once narrating his experience of his trek to the Himalayas referred Arjuna, who had to travel to northern part of India as separate entity (separate from his other four great brothers, who traveled out in other three directions). So he traveled across the Himalayas and met Lord Shiva in Form of Kirata (Hunter) who in turn bestowed upon Arjuna His special powerful energy. Eventually, in the pages of history this made Arjuna the great and powerful man on Earth. Later, we learn how he fought and defeated the Kauravas with great ease. Relating to this encounter of Arjuna and the blessings of Lord Shiva with His special powers, Romelji said that we could also absorb this special energy of Shri Shiva, and possess qualities of like Arjuna and counteract any negativity in our path with full

 powers of Shri Shiva. The Himalayas, Abode of Lord Shiva is like a living dynamite of power, (14th February 2004 on the Eve of Shiv Puja 2004) Since ancient times, the Himalayan peaks have always held an attraction for seekers of knowledge and meditate in the solitude of the mountain vastnesses. The gorgeous beauty of the Himalayan Mountains embellished with silver snow marks a magnificent paradise on earth. Where else on Earth do two of the massive tectonic plates that form the surface of the Earth overlap to form a wide, sky-high plain than in the spectacular Himalayan region? These majestic Himalayan ranges are located in the sub continent of Asia. Himalayas are erected as a protector for the countries like Nepal, Tibet (China), India, Pakistan and Bhutan. Himalayas are the world's highest mountain chain crowning the snow-capped peaks of 26,000 feet. (8000m). The Himalayan range forms a curvature of 1,500 miles through Southern Asia. The curved shaped Himalayas stretch out ahead the unbroken northern boundary of India and chisel across the Indian subcontinent as they carve intensely into the life encircling them. The Indian pilgrims who wander in these mountains in ancient times fabricated the term "Himalayas" from a Sanskrit word 'him' (snow) and 'alaya' (home) also means "the Abode of Snow". For centuries, the Himalayas have a strong impact on the inhabitants of India; their emotions were guarded by the blend of esteem, wonderment and apprehension. Indian Himalayan range stretches from west India to east India include 5 Indian states Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.. With double thick continental plates as a base, the peaks of the Himavat raise up yet another two and a half vertical miles culminating in the tallest of the Himalayan peaks - the 29,028- foot peak of the Lapchi Kang (Everest). The great Himalayan peaks that ring the Tibetan plateau to the south catch the snow and form the rivers that water the plains below. Tibet itself is a magical place, the Land of the Gods and the location of the fabled Shangri La. Most of the Himalayan ranges are raised up to more then 3 miles above sea level. Ganges, Indus and the Brahmaputra the most sacred rivers of India flow from the snow clad mountains from the foothills of Himalayas that are the major rhizome. It also treasures the adventurous trekking excursion, lush green meadows and exhibits the imperial power, splendor and zest of Nature. In Rig-Veda and Atharvaveda, the Himalayas is mentioned by the name Haimavata., No wonder then that a mountain of so many aspects is viewed in Indian mythology as having a 'divine soul'. It is called "Devatatma" in a Sanskrit poet Kalidasa's works. That divinity is an all-pervading idea can be seen by the fact that there is a reference to a situation where a sage catches sight of the mountain ranges in Krishna's stomach!

 As the 5th century AD famous Indian poet ranges to be the center of the earth. Kalidasa writes in his poem Kumarsambhava: To the sage's description may be added that these Astyurasyam Dishi Devatama Himalayo Nam ranges are the youngest in India and one of the Nagadhirajah Purvaparo Toyanidho Vagahaya youngest mountain systems of the world with Sthita Prathivya Iva Mandandah Means, in the many peaks yet to be christened.

In fact, a text called the Sama Veda (Sam Veda) does describe the mountain The Indian plate continues to move northward relative to Asia about 5 cm per year. Given the great magnitudes of the blocks of the Earth's crust

 involved this is a remarkable rate, about twice the speed at which your fingernails grow. This movement caused the rocks along the leading edge of the Indian plate to deform and fracture. Immense slices of Indian crust were pushed southward and stacked up to produce the Himalayas orogeny. Himalayas epitomizes the nature's creation on the Earth. As Shri Mataji once said," India had to move to the north so that Kailasa could rise to complete the seventh chakra of the universe". (Informal talk, Dehradun, March 1979) What the Himalayas reveal is interesting while, what it conceals is enigmatic. Shri Mataji reveals the riddle wrapped in enigma enveloped in mystery regarding evolution of Nepal and the position of the majesticheights of the Himalayas. "Nepal was named after a Rishi called Ne-Pal. Christ also came to Nepal. It is a special country created till it by Mother Earth. It was only a sea, after the Amrut -Manthan, the Himalayas started pushing up reached a certain point called the Everest. It was created to shield India, the Kundalini of the Universe. It was necessary to protect the Kundalini, It is the brain of the Virata. They had to fence some country to preserve the ancient culture. Shri Ganesha had to be placed in India. That is why I had to take my birth in this country, at the Tropicof Cancer."

 Mother said that one shouldn'e chant any Mantra. If a particular chakra/Nadi is catching then the respective mnantra should be said with Shri Mataji's name. If the stomach is paining then the mantra for the stomach should be said and not of the head. A Sahaja Yogi had discussed about Mantras with Shri Mataji and the experience is given below An Indian Sahaja Yogi, Mr. Phadke, published a magazine called 'Bhakti Sangam' on the occasion of Mother's 60th birthday (2 -03- 83). Mother asked him to translate this Magazine from Marathi into English. Therefore an Indian Yogini translates the notes of Mr. Phadake. ahaja Yoga - Discovery Knowledge In every sphere, self-experience is the knowledge of a seeker. A Sahaja Yogi who may be a teacher, a doctor or a scientist feels that Sahaja Yoga is 'the mother of invention'. It is interesting when a teacher at a deaf and dumb school, who has complete faith, wants to lead those deaf and dumb boys into Sahaja Yoga. In those days, H.H. Shri Mataji was staying at Prabhadevi in Bombay and one got a chance, quite often, to visit that place. There, experimental realisation was given and Shri Mataji satisfied whatever questions arose. With pleasure, She would satisfy all the questions and discuss them all. Regular meditation and experiments were done at home. The Chakras (seven of them) can be felt on both the hands. When the awakened Kundalini climbs towards Brahmarandra and pierces it, then the vibrations start flowing, the Spirit is then awakened. This is called self-realisation. Thoughtlessness is achieved in this stage. Since Shri Mataji has closed the Agnya Chakra, The Gods and Goddesses cannot be seen on reaching this Chakra, only the sensation is felt on the tips of the fingers. That's when the question arises, Is there God?" Whether to believe it because Shri Mataji says so? Then, how could the saints see God earlier? And so all sorts of questions may arise. Within a few days of meditation, colors were seen in the Agnya Chakra. It was rather surprising. Time would simply dissolve away while meditating, Two to three hours of meditation felt like 10-15 minutes only. Regarding colors, it was confirmed by referring to the Dyaneswari. This was told to Shri Mataji one day at Bharati Vidya Bhavan. Mother said, "Mr. Phadake, Chakras and their colors don't mean everything. You have to go further ahead than that. These colors mean only a particle of the sea or sand. We have to reach to the complete sand as a whole. These colors are like the scenes we pass while traveling by train. We don't remember the scenes and get involved in them. Wejust have a destination to reach. We forget all that we pass on the way, in between. In the same way attention should not go to the colors you pass on the way to Sahastrara. How the thoughtless awareness comes, how it should be established for long time,

 these should be observed. Only looking at the colors will reduce the attention at Agnya and it will be spoiled." After hearing this I was aware and realised. Eight to nine years have passed. After that so many experiments were done and people have been cured and negativities been removed. I am a teacher at a school for deaf and dumb boys. So, what will be the advantage of Sahaja Yoga to these deaf and dumb boys? One day, I asked inquired about this to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji said, "Boys will also get advantage of this, because the ear is also one of the five organs. These organs convey messages to the brain. The main power is different. If any disturbance occurs in the working of conveying the message, we can work it out through Sahastrara, but a lot of effort needs to be applied for that because the Sahastrara should be completely open. The Vishuddhi and Agnya Chakras of the deaf and dumb boys are already spoiled by their previous births. They should be purified and cleared, only then they can hear through Sahastrara instead of their ears. As our auditory center is in the brain, this center receives the hearing vibrations through the ears. If this message is received through the Sahastrara, then the work is done. The message, which is received by the auditory center, is connected to the speech center, by the way of answer. When it reaches the speech center. Then only we can answer properly. This happens in no time. Itstruck us that we could experiment with becoming artificially deaf ourselves. We blocked our ears and went into meditation. Thoughtlessness came as soon as the Kundalini reached Sahastrara. It took quite some time for this to happen. The experiment started by plugging the ears with small cotton balls and further blocking the ears completely by putting the index finger into the ear until no sound was heard. As we went into deeper meditation, cool breeze started flowing on the Sahastrara and both the hands. Then slowly, sound started coming from the Sahastrara. One could define the words in the beginning, and later on, after putting on the radio, songs could be identified. That time it was a wonderful surprise: complete, deepmeditation is required to clean these Chakras thoroughly. After some consideration, it was discovered that in the deaf boys, the two organs i.e. of hearing and talking don't work like those of a normal person, so their energy is saved, whereas normal people use quite a lot of power in doing these. Such people have special powers. The blind have special powers touch, which make them recognize better. of Ibrought 7 to 8 boys home and gave them realisation. I sat with them in the chain style with closed eyes. When I left the chain I asked them how they felt. From their answers it was known that some of them felt numbness in their legs, some had a tickling sensation in their backbone, all had got special, Divine Vibrations, which were flowing from one hand to another. Insome way, all could see Shri Radha and Shri Krishna, but I could not. I wondered if my progress was less. I asked Shri Mataji about it. Shri Mataji smiled and said, "Their Agnya Chakra is spoiled so they see God. It is good that you cannot see anything as such because I have elosed your Agnya Chakra and taken you to Sahastrara. So why do you come to Agnya? This type of vision is not required. Everything should be felt by the media of Divine Vibrations." Then later the question was whether they were real deities that were seen by these boys? How could one be sure of that?

 Medina aback to see Muhammad waiting for him for three days. The man said, when I didn't tuIrn up you should have gone away. Muhammad replied, "Since he had promised to meet, I had to wait to keep my word". Because he was extremely trustworthy, he became knownas Al-Amin. One day, Muhammad accompanied his uncle to Syria on business. On the journey he met Bahera, a Christian monk, who immediately recognized in the young boy a future prophet. That time Bahera told him that He was sent by God to be his messenger. In all his teachings, Muhammad openly praises both Judaism (Abraham is deeply respected within the Koran) and Christianity (Muhammad frequently praises Jesus and Mary in the Koran). When Muhammad was twenty-five years old he married Khadija, a widow of Mecca. She was a gentle woman of spotless character. She was also the first to follow Muhammad is considered as first Mohammedan (Muslim). Every year during Ramzan, Muhammad went to a cave on a hill called Hira and meditates. When he was forty years old, one day he heard a voice say, "Read". He replied, "I cannot read", Again the voice commanded, "Read in the name of your Lord who created man from a clot". Muhammad got confused and came out of the cave but stood thinking on the voice he heard. Again, he heard the voice saying, "O Muhammad, you are the messenger of God and I am Gabriel". The voice continued saying, "Rise, for thou art the Prophet of God. Go forth and preach in the name of thy Lord. Your God is merciful". When he returned from the cave, Muhammad was filled with divine majesty. After going to house, He narrated the whole thing to his wife and then she said, "You are faithful and never utter an untruth. Therefore, you may obey the call and follow the voice". She also takes him to her cousin, Waraga who knew all the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. He listened carefully on the whole narration and said, "Yes, I believe you are the promised prophet". Waraqa said all the prophets got their revelation in the similar way like the experience of Moses on Mount Sinai. He believes in himself to be the prophet and goes all out to preach the divine knowledge. Khadija was the first disciple to profess faith in the Prophet. She became his disciple and the first follower of Islam. "This is the only solution is to give them Self Realization. This Realization was called as miraj in the Koran. But they have said that nobody can get miraj. Muhammed-sahib gotit, butnobody else like they have banned people from getting Self Realization, which is not true -Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi After the revelation, Muhammad was commanded by God to tell his relatives about Islam. Islam means "Submission or Surrender" Surrender to the Will of God. Muhammad delivered public sermons on his faith to a large number of people, proclaiming the unity of God and denouncing the evil of drunkenness and impurity. He preached that they should worship only one God, they should respect women, and they should not lie, cheat and misappropriate money belonging to the poor. He said there are three types of Prayers to God, one is when you want something, second is because you are afraid of hell and the third is because you love God. He preached that everyone should pray God because you love God and for 16 2e

 nothing else. Though some ridiculed and turned away, others were converted by the power of his words. Once, he went to the Kaaba and proclaimed that there was no God but Allah. The worshipper of idols looked upon this as a great insult and attacked him, but was rescued by his disciples. He was abused and insulted frequently in public. The Prophet of Islam did not hold any debates nor did he challenge anyone to controversies and discussions. He silently converted people to his faith through his strong personality, charming demeanor and force of divine virtues. He bore with patience the persecution of his tormentors. His characteristics as well as the power of the verses of the Koran captivated the hearts of people. Since Qoreish tribe were against accepting his faith and also planned to take his life, Muhammad fled from Mecca to Yaathrib (now known as Medina) in 622 A.D. The Muslim calendar begins on the day of this flight, known as the Hijrat. The people of Yaathrib were anxiously waiting for the prophet and when they got this news of Muhammad coming to Yaathrib, they all came happily and eagerly to receive him. The people of Medina accepted Muhammad's faith readily because it was plain, simple and direct. With their help and with an army of men the Prophet later returned to Mecca, where he succeeded in converting his relatives and fellowmen. He then sent missionaries to other parts of Arabia in order to convert the entire peninsula to the new faith. In Medina, He constructed the first mosque for people to worship and offer prayers. Around the mosque, he constructed the houses for His followers to live ad also school where he taught divine laws to the people. Muhammad was himself a living example of the Divine's infinite capacity for forgiveness: many times he forgave enemies who had committed unspeakable atrocities against him and his brethren. He stood on divine truth and never compromised anything for this truth. In administering justice, he made no distinction between believers and nonbelievers, friends and foes, high and low. Sakhar, a chief of a tribe, had helped Muhammad greatly in the siege of Taif, for which he was naturally obliged to him. When two charges were brought against Sakhar, he decided against Sakhar and made him undo the wrong. He preached what was told by divine and made people imbibe these qualities by his own living. "So to get rid of this ego, we have a very simple method which Muhammad Saheb has suggested, which works very well, which is that you just have to take a shoe and beat yourself nicely everytime to get rid of ego." Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi The teaching of Muhammad attracted numerous followers because it was very simple and came from an honest man who never posed as a world teacher. He often told his disciples that he was an ordinary man as they were, teaching them to believe in Allah and His revelations. He emphasized the principle of brotherhood and equality of man, and is based on austere, simple living and complete surrender to Allah. Hence the religion based on his faith came to be known as Islam that means "Surrender". When the Quoerish tribe in Mecca learnt that Muhammad has influenced many people with his faith in Yaathrib, the chief of Mecca rage the battle to kill Muhammad. Till this time, Muhammad and his followers were silent and suffered the insult of Meccans. At this time God commanded Muhammad to fight against Meccans for seif-defence. Since, lot of family had homes in Yaathrib, Muhammad chose a place called as Badr, which was eighty miles away from Yaathrib. This battle is also known as Battle of Badr. This battle ended with followers of Muhammad defeating the Meccans. The Meccans fled and Medinites came with the news of Victory to the prophet. Muhammad's peak defining experience, called the Meraj, saw him elevated through the seven heavens to the realm of God Almighty at the resplendent Sidrath where he communed with God, received his 17

 divine visions and instructions and was placed on the inexorable course of his life-mission to establish Islam. Muhammad was escorted by the archangel Gabriel.(a masculine force) but the vehicle upon Muhammad rode was the beautiful "Buraq". The Buraq was a white horse with wings and the face of a woman! Clearly suggesting that the great power by which Muhammad was elevated to the level of supreme consciousness was ultimately feminine in nature! Some scholars say that the Buraq is an Islamic symbol of the Kundalini, a force that Eastern Yogis describe as the Goddess or Divine Mother. Even though, Fathima was daughter of Muhammad, He treated Her with great respect because He knew that She was a Kaaba, The Black Stone (Meccashwar Shiv) in Mecca incarnation. which divine Finally, in 632 A.D., lot of people in Mecca accepted Muhammad's preaching and embraced his new religion, Islam. Muhammad went to Mecca, went round the Kaaba (the holy black stone) and delivered his last sermon there and forgave all the cruelties committed against him and exhorted his followers to look after their women and treat all human beings equally. On 12th day of Rabi-ul-Awal (632 A.D), he passes away and was buried in Medina, the city that had loved him and welcomed him dearly. Even now, all people who go to Mecca then go to Medina after the pilgrimage is over to visit his grave. like all the manifestations of the past, assured his followers that a great messenger would come after him. He said that the religion of God, which had come down from heaven through Him, would go back to God after the passing of thousand years. Finally He said, when no trace of God's religion was left on earth, the people would behold the face of God himself. After Muhammad passed away, His daughter Fathimaji who was also an incarnation laid down some rules for women to protect their chastity. She was the one who started the Burkhs system. Fathima was very beautiful to look at and was in the midst of very aggressive Arabic people who never respected women. She covered her face with a cloth so that people never look at her and can maintain Her chastity. This is the way; She also protected the attention of men not to get distracted. Now at this time of Kaliyuga, when no religion exists in its true form, the people have no option other than hold the face of God whom Muhammad, The main injunctions of Islam are Namaz (prayer), pilgrimage, charity and firm belief in the oneness of God and His prophets, particularly Muhammad. The holy Koran, divided into more than one hundred chapters, opens and ends with the subject of the unity of God. The religion of Islam is essentially a religion of peace, for Muhammad was a lover of peace and non-violence. Selflessness and service to suffering humanity are the watchwords of Islam. In all his preaching, He had high esteem for women and regards Mary, Mother of Christ, as the most marvelous women and considers her as a high adept and living example of the pure and holy life. Later Koranic commentaries describe Mary as an intervening force between God (Allah) and humanity. This intervening force is characterized by Allah's mercy, forgiveness, sweetness and humility-the embodiment of Allah's love for creation. In Sahaja yoga, we know that this power is nothing but Kundalini, which is responsible for union with God. In Sahaja yoga, we all know that Muhammad was none other than the incarnation of Adi Guru Dattatreya himself. He came on this earth to teach the people about divine laws in a very simple way that even a common man can understand. Also, we consider Fathimaji as the incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. Sheis the beholder of purity in one's attention. 18

 परिचय : स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र एक उपग्रह की तरह नाभी चक्र से जुडा भवसागर के चारो तरफ घूमता है तथा उसके दस
पन्खुडियों को (जो दस गुरुओं के उपदेश के प्रतीक है ) आधार देता है। जब कुन्डलिनी शक्ति जागृत होती है तो पहले
नाभी चक्र से गुजरती है और बाद में स्वाधिष्ठान से गुजरती है और वहाँ से वापस नाभी चक्र से होकर अपना सफर
सहस्त्रार तक तंय करती है। उत्क्रान्ति के दौरान मानव ने शरणस्थल की इच्छा को घर बनाने मे परिवर्तित किया।
मानव की सौन्दर्य शक्ति निरन्तर बढ़ती रही है और अपने शरणस्थल (घर) को अधिकाधिक आधुनिक स्वरुप देने लगा
| फलस्वरूप सौभाग्य से वास्तुकला शास्त्र का निर्माण हुआ। उसकी यही सृजनशीलता (creativity) बढकर अमूर्त
स्वरुप लेने लगी, जहाँ वह सोचने लगा, उसे प्रकाशित करने लगा और उसकी छवि बनाने लगा जिसका इससे पहले
वस्तुस्वरुप मे कोई भी मेल नहीं मिलता था। इसी उगते हुए सौन्दर्य शासत्र से रचनात्मक कला की उत्पति हुई।
में D
गुण : स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र का मूलभूत गुण है सृजनशीलता । यही से सृजनशीलता के लिए उज्जा उत्पन्न होती है। अपने
आत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद हम जानने लगते है कि सृजनशीलता को पाने का सच्चा मार्ग हैं अपने ध्यान में निर्विचार
समाधी प्राप्त करना। इसी से हम जानने लगते है कि सृजनशीलता का सौदर्य हमारे अन्दर एक स्तब्ध तथा शान्त तालाब
की तरह है। जब हम उस तालाब को खोज निकालते हैं तो हम उसका माध्यम बन जाते हैं। हम इस सामूहिक अन्त:
मन का सृजन साधन बन जाते है जिसमे अहंकार नहीं होता जो इस कला के शुध्दता को प्रदूषित करे। कवि वर्डवर्थ के
अनुसार, "यह एक हृदय, जो देखता है और ग्रहण करता है"। सृजनशीलता की हर एक विधि स्वाधिष्ठान के गुणों से
ही संचालित होती है। अगर यह क्रिया संतुलन मे प्राप्त की गयी (सूक्ष्म यन्त्रना के सुषुम्ना मार्ग से) तो फलस्वरुप
अध्यात्मिक उन्लति होती है और हम कह सकते है कि यह हृदय से बनी थी। आत्म-साक्षात्कार के बाद इस बातपर जोर
दिया जाता है और फलस्वरुप एक सृजनप्रेरित कार्य हो जाता है। पुराने कलाकार जैसे मोझार्ट और माइकेल अन्जोलो
जो की जन्म से आत्मसाक्षात्कारी थे, उनका सौन्दर्य अभिरुचिपूर्ण कार्य हमे यही चीज दर्शाता है । इस गुनवत्ता का कार्य
अमर होता है जो हमे आनंद तथा सौन्द्रर्य प्रदान करता है जो कि सम्पूर्ण युग को दर्शाता है । लेकिन इस आधुनिक
कार्यपद्धति मे यह अकसर देखा गया है की जो कलाकार शुरू मे हदय से कार्य करते है, उनकी प्रवृत्ति कुछ इस तरह बन
जाती है कि वो आगे चलकर निर्जीव, उथला तथा शोषण करने वाला कार्य करते हैं। इस प्रवृत्ति का मूलभूत कारण है,
कलाकार का अहंकार। जैसे जैसे कलाकर यशस्वी होने लगता है वो अधिक परिश्वम करता है जिससे उसकी यशस्विता
बरकरार रहे। इसके लिये उसे बाईने नाडी का (पिंगला नाडी या कार्य नाडी) बहुत ज्यादा इस्तेमाल आवश्यक हो जाता
है। फलस्वरुप इस नाडी के अत्याधिक तनावपूर्ण उपयोग से कलाकार के अहंकार का गुब्बारा बहुत फूल जाता है।
ध्यान दीजीए कि मानव के सूक्ष्म यन्त्र में अहंकार पिंगला नाडी या कार्यशक्ति के अन्त मे सिर के दाहिने बाजू मे एक
गुब्बारे के आकार मे स्थित है। जैसे जैसे कलाकारयह सोचने लगता है कि वही संपूर्णत: कला का निर्माता है (दैवी प्रेरणा
को भूला देता है) तो यह प्रक्रिया बढने लगती है, अहंकार बढ़ता जाता है, और अन्तता उस के कला से अध्याति्मिकता
का अंश संपूर्णत : नष्ट हो जाता है। आत्मा जो हमारे हृदय में विराजमान है, वही सृजनता का वास्तविक स्त्रीत है और
कलाकार और अन्य लोग जो बहुत सोचते हैं, नाम तथा शोहरत के पीछे भागते है, उनका स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र कमजोर पड
जाता है और वे एक असन्तुलित व्यक्ति बन जाते है। दुसरो की अपेक्षा श्रेष्ठ बनने की अभिलाषा दूसरो से अपने गुण की
प्रशंसा की महत्वाकांक्षा उनके अहंकार से आती है जो कि पिंगला नाडी व्हारा स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र के दाहिने तरफ से जुडा
हुआ है । इस महत्वाकांक्षी तथा स्पर्धात्मक सृजनशीलता के कारण उनकी सहजता लुप्त हो जाती है। इसी से यह स्पष्ट
होता है कि आधुनिक कलाकृतियाँ मे चेतना, हृदयता तथा अत्मिक पहलूओ की कमी क्यो होती है।
"The function of the liver is to absorb all the poison of the body and convert it into heat, which

person has heat here, then the heat starts passing upwards through the right heart. It creates

lethargic liver and the other is overactive liver. I am talking of the over active liver, where a person
develops cold, sneezing, temper, anger, acidity and tension. Then this heat passes over and can
go to the heart at a very young age. Supposing there are boys who are playing tennis or exercise of
a vigorous nature and drinking this might affect and can cause a massive heart attack at a very
young age. The same heat when it passes to the throat we develop throat trouble, hoarseness etc.
when it moves down to your pancreas then the poor pancreas is also suffering because it has no

पूर्वयोजना इस क्रिया को अतिकार्यशील करते हैं जिससे यह चक्र का जरूरत से ज्यादा उपयोग होता है। स्वाधिष्ठान
चक्र यकृत (लिवर) का भी कार्य नियमन (नाभी चक्र के साथ मिलकर) करता है। अगर इस चक्र को अति विचारों के
लिए कार्य करना पड़े तो दूसरे अंग जो इसके द्वारा नियन्त्रित है उपेक्षित हो जाते है । इस उपेक्षा का प्रभाव यक्ृत पर
सबसे ज्यादा पडता है । इस चक्र की बाधाए हमारे दाहिने हाथ के अगूठे तथा बीच के उंगुली पर फडकन, झनझनाहट
और हाथ पर चुभन के रूप मे महसूश होती है। हमारे यकृत का इसमे अलग महत्व है क्योकि यही हमारे चित्त का पीठ है।
चित्त और विचारो के भेद मे भ्रमित नही होना चाहिए । विचार तो हमारे अहंकार से और प्रतिअहंकार (हमारे पुराने
संसकार तथा परिस्थितियों) से आते है। और चित्त शुध्द एकाग्रता है जो विचार तथा मस्तिष्क के कार्योके बिना है,
उदाहरण के तौर पर जब हम फूल की तरफ देखते है तो अपना चित्त उस पर डालते है (साक्षी स्वरुप मे) लेकिन हम उसके
बारे मे विचार नहीं करते हैं। चित्त विचारों से संलग्नित नहीं होता, वह शुद्ध एकाग्रता और साक्षीभाव से देखना मात्र है ।
एक संतुलित यकृत हमारे चित्त को सम्भालता तथा पोषित करता है। वह बाहरी बाधाओं और अशुध्दयों को छान कर उसे
शुद्ध रखता है और इसी शुध्दित चित्त से शान्ति तथा स्थिरता हमारे ध्यान के दौरान हमें प्राप्त होती है। हमारा यकृत
अतितापित होने पर ( मद्यपान , उत्तेजक पदार्थ सेवन से) बहुत संवेदनशील बनता है जिसका विपरीत प्रभाव हमारे
चित्त पर होता है और हमारा ध्यान कमजोर हो जाता है।

HIMALAY
A SAHAJA INSIGHT
It is said that meditating on the Himalayas brings liberation in the form of true knowledge dispelling
the darkness of ignorance and helps attain a pure state of the ultimate and not just the seat of the wise
and source of waters that keep life, but the very fountainhead of 'Sumati' and 'Smriti' or knowledge
and cognitive memory, As a proverb it is said, just as dew disappears with the morning sun, all sins
get washed away at the very sight of the magnificent Himalayas. The whole of the Himalayas are
viewed as the abode of Lord Shiva. He rests in different forms on these mountains with Mount Kailash
being his permanent residence. He even married the daughter of the king of the Himalayan
Mountains, 'Sati' or 'Himavati' or the Daughter of Snow.
There are innumerable stories related and buried deep into these mystic snow white peaks of divine
creation of Divine the Himalayas. It is said once the Pandavas, the five heroic brothers of the epic,
Mahabharata, visited the Lord here in these recesses of mountain. When Lord Shiva saw them coming
he, however, changed his form into one of a buffalo and tried to run away. The five brothers managed
to get hold of him, but only his posterior. It is believed that in Kedaradesa only the posterior part of the
Lord remains. His body was separated into five parts and spread all over the Himalayas and these five
sites are together known as "Pancha Kendaras". The path to heaven is said to run up the Himalayas.
Yudhishtra, of the Mahabharata, is said to have climbed these peaks in his progress towards heaven
the one leading to the heavens is called "Swargarohini", where Swarga means heaven "Arohini"
means ascent. Chomolungma is the "Goddess Mother of the earth" in Tibetan.
Romel Verma, Shri Mataji's SonIn law, once narrating his experience of his trek to the Himalayas
referred Arjuna, who had to travel to northern part of India as separate entity (separate from his other
four great brothers, who traveled out in other three directions). So he traveled across the Himalayas
and met Lord Shiva in Form of Kirata (Hunter) who in turn
bestowed upon Arjuna His special powerful energy.
Eventually, in the pages of history this made Arjuna
the great and powerful man on Earth. Later,
we learn how he fought and defeated the
Kauravas with great ease. Relating to
this encounter of Arjuna and the
blessings of Lord Shiva with His
special powers, Romelji said that we
could also absorb this special energy
of Shri Shiva, and possess qualities
of like Arjuna and counteract any
negativity in our path with full

 powers of Shri Shiva. The
Himalayas, Abode of Lord Shiva is
like a living dynamite of power,
(14th February 2004 on the Eve of
Shiv Puja 2004) Since ancient
times, the Himalayan peaks have
always held an attraction for
seekers of knowledge and
meditate in the solitude of the
mountain vastnesses. The
gorgeous beauty of the Himalayan
Mountains embellished with
silver snow marks a magnificent paradise on earth. Where else on Earth do two of the massive tectonic
plates that form the surface of the Earth overlap to form a wide, sky-high plain than in the spectacular
Himalayan region? These majestic Himalayan ranges are located in the sub continent of Asia.
Himalayas are erected as a protector for the countries like Nepal, Tibet (China), India, Pakistan and
Bhutan. Himalayas are the world's highest mountain chain crowning the snow-capped peaks of
26,000 feet. (8000m). The Himalayan range forms a curvature of 1,500 miles through Southern Asia.
The curved shaped Himalayas stretch out ahead the unbroken northern boundary of India and chisel
across the Indian subcontinent as they carve intensely into the life encircling them. The Indian
pilgrims who wander in these mountains in ancient times fabricated the term "Himalayas" from a
Sanskrit word 'him' (snow) and 'alaya' (home) also means "the Abode of Snow". For centuries, the
Himalayas have a strong impact on the inhabitants of India; their emotions were guarded by the blend
of esteem, wonderment and apprehension. Indian Himalayan range stretches from west India to east
India include 5 Indian states Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Sikkim and
Arunachal Pradesh.. With double thick continental plates as a base, the peaks of the Himavat raise up
yet another two and a half vertical miles culminating in the tallest of the Himalayan peaks - the 29,028-
foot peak of the Lapchi Kang (Everest). The great Himalayan peaks that ring the Tibetan plateau to the
south catch the snow and form the rivers that water the plains below. Tibet itself is a magical place, the
Land of the Gods and the location of the fabled Shangri La. Most of the Himalayan ranges are raised up
to more then 3 miles above sea level. Ganges, Indus and the Brahmaputra the most sacred rivers of
India flow from the snow clad mountains from the foothills of Himalayas that are the major rhizome. It
also treasures the adventurous trekking excursion, lush green meadows and exhibits the imperial
power, splendor and zest of Nature.
In Rig-Veda and Atharvaveda, the Himalayas is mentioned by the name Haimavata., No wonder then
that a mountain of so many aspects is viewed in Indian mythology as having a 'divine soul'. It is called
"Devatatma" in a Sanskrit poet Kalidasa's works. That divinity is an all-pervading idea can be seen by
the fact that there is a reference to a situation where a sage catches sight of the mountain ranges in
Krishna's stomach!

(Informal talk, Dehradun, March 1979) What the Himalayas reveal is interesting while, what it
conceals is enigmatic. Shri Mataji reveals the riddle wrapped in enigma enveloped in mystery
regarding evolution of Nepal and the position of the majesticheights of the Himalayas.

 Mother said that one shouldn'e chant any Mantra. If a particular
chakra/Nadi is catching then the respective mnantra should be said with
Shri Mataji's name. If the stomach is paining then the mantra for the
stomach should be said and not of the head. A Sahaja Yogi had
discussed about Mantras with Shri Mataji and the experience is given
below
An Indian Sahaja Yogi, Mr. Phadke, published a magazine called
'Bhakti Sangam' on the occasion of Mother's 60th birthday (2 -03-
83). Mother asked him to translate this Magazine from Marathi into
English. Therefore an Indian Yogini translates the notes of Mr.
Phadake.
ahaja Yoga - Discovery Knowledge
In every sphere, self-experience is the knowledge of a seeker. A Sahaja Yogi who may be a teacher, a
doctor or a scientist feels that Sahaja Yoga is 'the mother of invention'. It is interesting when a teacher at a
deaf and dumb school, who has complete faith, wants to lead those deaf and dumb boys into Sahaja
Yoga.
In those days, H.H. Shri Mataji was staying at Prabhadevi in Bombay and one got a chance, quite often, to
visit that place. There, experimental realisation was given and Shri Mataji satisfied whatever questions
arose. With pleasure, She would satisfy all the questions and discuss them all. Regular meditation and
experiments were done at home.
The Chakras (seven of them) can be felt on both the hands. When the awakened Kundalini climbs
towards Brahmarandra and pierces it, then the vibrations start flowing, the Spirit is then awakened. This
is called self-realisation. Thoughtlessness is achieved in this stage.
Since Shri Mataji has closed the Agnya Chakra, The Gods and Goddesses cannot be seen on reaching this
Chakra, only the sensation is felt on the tips of the fingers. That's when the question arises, Is there God?"
Whether to believe it because Shri Mataji says so? Then, how could the saints see God earlier? And so all
sorts of questions may arise.
Within a few days of meditation, colors were seen in the Agnya Chakra. It was rather surprising. Time
would simply dissolve away while meditating, Two to three hours of meditation felt like 10-15 minutes
only.
Regarding colors, it was confirmed by referring to the Dyaneswari. This was told to Shri Mataji one day
at Bharati Vidya Bhavan. Mother said, "Mr. Phadake, Chakras and their colors don't mean everything.
You have to go further ahead than that. These colors mean only a particle of the sea or sand. We have to
reach to the complete sand as a whole. These colors are like the scenes we pass while traveling by train.
We don't remember the scenes and get involved in them. Wejust have a destination to reach. We forget all
that we pass on the way, in between. In the same way attention should not go to the colors you pass on the
way to Sahastrara. How the thoughtless awareness comes, how it should be established for long time,
 2004_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_IV.pdf-page-11.txt 
 these should be observed. Only looking at the colors will reduce the attention at Agnya and it will be
spoiled."
After hearing this I was aware and realised. Eight to nine years have passed. After that so many
experiments were done and people have been cured and negativities been removed.
I am a teacher at a school for deaf and dumb boys. So, what will be the advantage of Sahaja Yoga to these
deaf and dumb boys? One day, I asked inquired about this to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji said, "Boys will also
get advantage of this, because the ear is also one of the five organs. These organs convey messages to the
brain. The main power is different. If any disturbance occurs in the working of conveying the message,
we can work it out through Sahastrara, but a lot of effort needs to be applied for that because the
Sahastrara should be completely open. The Vishuddhi and Agnya Chakras of the deaf and dumb boys
are already spoiled by their previous births. They should be purified and cleared, only then they can
hear through Sahastrara instead of their ears. As our auditory center is in the brain, this center receives
the hearing vibrations through the ears. If this message is received through the Sahastrara, then the work
is done. The message, which is received by the auditory center, is connected to the speech center, by the
way of answer. When it reaches the speech center. Then only we can answer properly. This happens in no
time.
Itstruck us that we could experiment with becoming artificially deaf ourselves. We blocked our ears and
went into meditation. Thoughtlessness came as soon as the Kundalini reached Sahastrara. It took quite
some time for this to happen. The experiment started by plugging the ears with small cotton balls and
further blocking the ears completely by putting the index finger into the ear until no sound was heard. As
we went into deeper meditation, cool breeze started flowing on the Sahastrara and both the hands. Then
slowly, sound started coming from the Sahastrara. One could define the words in the beginning, and
later on, after putting on the radio, songs could be identified. That time it was a wonderful surprise:
complete, deepmeditation is required to clean these Chakras thoroughly.
After some consideration, it was discovered that in the deaf boys, the two organs i.e. of hearing and
talking don't work like those of a normal person, so their energy is saved, whereas normal people use

Ibrought 7 to 8 boys home and gave them realisation. I sat with them in the chain style with closed
eyes.
When I left the chain I asked them how they felt. From their answers it was known that some of them felt
numbness in their legs, some had a tickling sensation in their backbone, all had got special, Divine
Vibrations, which were flowing from one hand to another. Insome way, all could see Shri Radha and Shri
Krishna, but I could not. I wondered if my progress was less. I asked Shri Mataji about it. Shri Mataji
smiled and said, "Their Agnya Chakra is spoiled so they see God. It is good that you cannot see anything
as such because I have elosed your Agnya Chakra and taken you to Sahastrara. So why do you come to
Agnya? This type of vision is not required. Everything should be felt by the media of Divine Vibrations."
Then later the question was whether they were real deities that were seen by these boys? How could one
be sure of that? Within 15 minutes we got the answers, through the thought that came into the mind.
Once Shri Mataji had said in a lecture, "When you are in complete thoughtless awareness, and the

aback to see Muhammad waiting for him for three
days. The man said, when I didn't tuIrn up you
should have gone away. Muhammad replied, "Since
he had promised to meet, I had to wait to keep my
word". Because he was extremely trustworthy, he
became knownas Al-Amin.
One day, Muhammad accompanied his uncle to
Syria on business. On the journey he met Bahera, a
Christian monk, who immediately recognized in the
young boy a future prophet. That time Bahera told
him that He was sent by God to be his messenger. In
all his teachings, Muhammad openly praises both
Judaism (Abraham is deeply respected within the Koran) and Christianity (Muhammad frequently
praises Jesus and Mary in the Koran).
When Muhammad was twenty-five years old he married Khadija, a widow of Mecca. She was a gentle
woman of spotless character. She was also the first to follow Muhammad is considered as first
Mohammedan (Muslim).
Every year during Ramzan, Muhammad went to a cave on a hill called Hira and meditates. When he was
forty years old, one day he heard a voice say, "Read". He replied, "I cannot read", Again the voice
commanded, "Read in the name of your Lord who created man from a clot". Muhammad got confused
and came out of the cave but stood thinking on the voice he heard. Again, he heard the voice saying, "O
Muhammad, you are the messenger of God and I am Gabriel". The voice continued saying, "Rise, for
thou art the Prophet of God. Go forth and preach in the name of thy Lord. Your God is merciful".
When he returned from the cave, Muhammad was filled with divine majesty. After going to house, He
narrated the whole thing to his wife and then she said, "You are faithful and never utter an untruth.
Therefore, you may obey the call and follow the voice". She also takes him to her cousin, Waraga who
knew all the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. He listened carefully on the whole narration and said,
"Yes, I believe you are the promised prophet". Waraqa said all the prophets got their revelation in the
similar way like the experience of Moses on Mount Sinai. He believes in himself to be the prophet and
goes all out to preach the divine knowledge. Khadija was the first disciple to profess faith in the Prophet.
She became his disciple and the first follower of Islam.
"This is the only solution is to give them Self Realization. This Realization was called as miraj in the
Koran. But they have said that nobody can get miraj. Muhammed-sahib gotit, butnobody else like
they have banned people from getting Self Realization, which is not true
-Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
After the revelation, Muhammad was commanded by God to tell his relatives about Islam. Islam means
"Submission or Surrender" Surrender to the Will of God. Muhammad delivered public sermons on his
faith to a large number of people, proclaiming the unity of God and denouncing the evil of drunkenness
and impurity. He preached that they should worship only one God, they should respect women, and
they should not lie, cheat and misappropriate money belonging to the poor. He said there are three types
of Prayers to God, one is when you want something, second is because you are afraid of hell and the third
is because you love God. He preached that everyone should pray God because you love God and for
16 2e

 nothing else. Though some ridiculed and turned away, others were converted by the power of his words.
Once, he went to the Kaaba and proclaimed that there was no God but Allah. The worshipper of idols
looked upon this as a great insult and attacked him, but was rescued by his disciples. He was abused and
insulted frequently in public. The Prophet of Islam did not hold any debates nor did he challenge anyone
to controversies and discussions. He silently converted people to his faith through his strong personality,
charming demeanor and force of divine virtues. He bore with patience the persecution of his tormentors.
His characteristics as well as the power of the verses of the Koran captivated the hearts of people.
Since Qoreish tribe were against accepting his faith and also planned to take his life, Muhammad fled
from Mecca to Yaathrib (now known as Medina) in 622 A.D. The Muslim calendar begins on the day of
this flight, known as the Hijrat. The people of Yaathrib were anxiously waiting for the prophet and when
they got this news of Muhammad coming to Yaathrib, they all came happily and eagerly to receive him.
The people of Medina accepted Muhammad's faith readily because it was plain, simple and direct. With
their help and with an army of men the Prophet later returned to Mecca, where he succeeded in
converting his relatives and fellowmen. He then sent missionaries to other parts of Arabia in order to
convert the entire peninsula to the new faith. In Medina, He constructed the first mosque for people to
worship and offer prayers. Around the mosque, he constructed the houses for His followers to live ad
also school where he taught divine laws to the people.
Muhammad was himself a living example of the Divine's infinite capacity for forgiveness: many times he
forgave enemies who had committed unspeakable atrocities against him and his brethren. He stood on
divine truth and never compromised anything for this truth. In administering justice, he made no
distinction between believers and nonbelievers, friends and foes, high and low. Sakhar, a chief of a tribe,
had helped Muhammad greatly in the siege of Taif, for which he was naturally obliged to him. When two
charges were brought against Sakhar, he decided against Sakhar and made him undo the wrong. He
preached what was told by divine and made people imbibe these qualities by his own living.
"So to get rid of this ego, we have a very simple method which Muhammad Saheb has suggested,
which works very well, which is that you just have to take a shoe and beat yourself nicely
everytime to get rid of ego."
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
The teaching of Muhammad attracted numerous followers because it was very simple and came from an
honest man who never posed as a world teacher. He often told his disciples that he was an ordinary man
as they were, teaching them to believe in Allah and His revelations. He emphasized the principle of
brotherhood and equality of man, and is based on austere, simple living and complete surrender to
Allah. Hence the religion based on his faith came to be known as Islam that means "Surrender".
When the Quoerish tribe in Mecca learnt that Muhammad has influenced many people with his faith in
Yaathrib, the chief of Mecca rage the battle to kill Muhammad. Till this time, Muhammad and his
followers were silent and suffered the insult of Meccans. At this time God commanded Muhammad to
fight against Meccans for seif-defence. Since, lot of family had homes in Yaathrib, Muhammad chose a
place called as Badr, which was eighty miles away from Yaathrib. This battle is also known as Battle of
Badr. This battle ended with followers of Muhammad defeating the Meccans. The Meccans fled and
Medinites came with the news of Victory to the prophet.
Muhammad's peak defining experience, called the Meraj, saw him elevated through the seven heavens
to the realm of God Almighty at the resplendent Sidrath where he communed with God, received his

 divine visions and instructions and was placed on the
inexorable course of his life-mission to establish Islam.
Muhammad was escorted by the archangel Gabriel.(a
masculine force) but the vehicle upon
Muhammad rode was the beautiful "Buraq". The Buraq
was a white horse with wings and the face of a woman!
Clearly suggesting that the great power by which
Muhammad was elevated to the level of supreme
consciousness was ultimately feminine in nature! Some
scholars say that the Buraq is an Islamic symbol of the
Kundalini, a force that Eastern Yogis describe as the
Goddess or Divine Mother. Even though, Fathima was
daughter of Muhammad, He treated Her with great
respect because He knew that She was a Kaaba, The Black Stone (Meccashwar Shiv) in Mecca

Finally, in 632 A.D., lot of people in Mecca accepted Muhammad's preaching and embraced his new
religion, Islam. Muhammad went to Mecca, went round the Kaaba (the holy black stone) and delivered
his last sermon there and forgave all the cruelties committed against him and exhorted his followers to
look after their women and treat all human beings equally. On 12th day of Rabi-ul-Awal (632 A.D), he
passes away and was buried in Medina, the city that had loved him and welcomed him dearly. Even now,
all people who go to Mecca then go to Medina after the pilgrimage is over to visit his grave.
like all the manifestations of the past, assured his followers that a great messenger would come after him.
He said that the religion of God, which had come down from heaven through Him, would go back to God
after the passing of thousand years. Finally He said, when no trace of God's religion was left on earth, the
people would behold the face of God himself.
After Muhammad passed away, His daughter Fathimaji who was also an incarnation laid down some
rules for women to protect their chastity. She was the one who started the Burkhs system. Fathima was
very beautiful to look at and was in the midst of very aggressive Arabic people who never respected
women. She covered her face with a cloth so that people never look at her and can maintain Her chastity.
This is the way; She also protected the attention of men not to get distracted.
Now at this time of Kaliyuga, when no religion exists in its true form, the people have no option other
than hold the face of God whom
Muhammad,
The main injunctions of Islam are Namaz (prayer), pilgrimage, charity and firm belief in the oneness of
God and His prophets, particularly Muhammad. The holy Koran, divided into more than one hundred
chapters, opens and ends with the subject of the unity of God. The religion of Islam is essentially a
religion of peace, for Muhammad was a lover of peace and non-violence. Selflessness and service to
suffering humanity are the watchwords of Islam. In all his preaching, He had high esteem for women and
regards Mary, Mother of Christ, as the most marvelous women and considers her as a high adept and
living example of the pure and holy life. Later Koranic commentaries describe Mary as an intervening
force between God (Allah) and humanity. This intervening force is characterized by Allah's mercy,
forgiveness, sweetness and humility-the embodiment of Allah's love for creation. In Sahaja yoga, we
know that this power is nothing but Kundalini, which is responsible for union with God.
In Sahaja yoga, we all know that Muhammad was none other than the incarnation of Adi Guru
Dattatreya himself. He came on this earth to teach the people about divine laws in a very simple way that
even a common man can understand. Also, we consider Fathimaji as the incarnation of Goddess
Lakshmi. Sheis the beholder of purity in one's attention.

अकार तो ब्रह्मा उकार तो विष्णु। मकार महेश जाणियेला ॥
