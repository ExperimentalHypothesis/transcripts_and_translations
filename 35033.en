Shri Mataji reads a part of the chapter 1 of “Jesus, The Son of Man” from Kahlil Gibran, 1985

"And were it not for sorrow in all of you I would not have stayed to weep."
“Who are you and what are you, Judas Iscariot? And why do you tempt me?"
“Have you in truth weighed me in the scale and found me one to lead legions of pygmies? And to direct chariots of the shapeless against an enemy that encompass-that encamps only in your hatred and marches nowhere but in your fear?"

Shri Mataji: "Marches nowhere but in your fear", means you have enemies within yourself.
“Too many are the worms that crawl about me feet, and I will give them no battle. They are worms! I am weary of the jest, and weary of pitying the creepers who deem me coward because I will not move among their guarded walls and towers. "
"Pity it is that I must needs pity to the very end."
"Would that I could turn my steps towards a larger world where larger men dwell. But, how shall I?"

Shri Mataji: And now he said about the future, he?
“Your priest and your emperor would have my blood. They shall be satisfied ere" means before, "I go hence. I would not change the course of the law. And I would not govern folly".

Shri Mataji: Because, it’s because of the law that he was to be crucified.
“Let ignorance reproduce itself until it is weary of its own offspring."
“Let the blind lead the blind to the pitfall."
“And let the dead bury the dead till the earth be choked with its own bitter fruit."
“My kingdom is not of the earth. My kingdom shall be where two or three of you shall meet in love, and in wonder at the loveliness of life, and in good cheer, and in remembrance of me.”
Shri Mataji: This is collectivity. This is collectivity, just understand.
“My kingdom is not of the earth. My kingdom shall be where two or three of you shall meet in love, and in wonder at the loveliness of life, and in good cheer, and in remembrance of me.”
Then of a sudden He turned to Judas, and He said, “Get you behind me, man. Your kingdoms shall never be in my kingdom.”

Shri Mataji: Kya Kahlil Gibran!
He’s tremendous!
May God bless you all!
There are so many things written already to encourage us to be walking in the right path of our Spirit. We should never get desperate or discouraged. There’s so much already said about it.
All right. May God bless you.
