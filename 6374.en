Talk on arrival in Kyiv, Borispol Airport, Kyiv, Ukraine, Sept. 24, 1995

I really don’t know how to thank you for this surprise. [Applause]It’s very kind. All and your children have come down here.

I have a very great concern for Ukraine. [Applause and laughter]While coming in the plane, I was looking at your beautiful land near the river Dnieper. Aside: It’s good now.And I felt such a good land you have here and I also know that once upon a time, this was a very rich country where the wheat and all this produce were supplied to whole of Europe. So I was asking about, “What has happened to this country? It was very reach country just before separation. So they said that this land is now doesn’t belong to anybody and the government does all the [unclear] and agriculture.

In the- in My country also, we had same problem that land produce was very little, because few people were doing only for themselves. But then they formed cooperatives and gave the land to people for cooperatives and it was called as the ‘Green Revolution’. And thus our problem was solved, our problem of food, everything. So, if Sahaja Yogis can ask for no war anymore, so they can help their government to solve the problem. Because Ukrainian Sahaja Yogis are very deep and are very good people. We had one problem because of this Chernobyl problem. But it seems you people look very much now all right and healthy. [Shri Mataji smiles] [Applause and laughter].

With Sahaja Yoga, all these problems which are minor can be easily solved. But one thing is that you must work in unison as one person, as part and parcel of one Human being. And also try to understand how you can solve the problems. He’s just told me that you don’t have oil [inaudible] – doesn’t matter. You are such great artists and you are producing beautiful things out of your hands. And do you know in the West they don’t know now anymore how to do handmade things. So, you can really sell all that out and can really solve your problems. There are so many things you can think of because you are now Realized souls. Because there is a help of the Divine as well as you yourselves become very alert.

I found, in Russia, that Americans are taking over. They have brought all their dirty culture to Russia and people are taking to it. If you go to America, you will know that they are really living in Hell because they believe in a joy at every minute. But what they are doing is nothing but self-destruction. Their music, their everything shows that they are extremely frustrated. With all the money they have, they are committing suicides. The mothers kill their children, the father kills the wife. It goes on those like this: killing. So, you should keep to your own culture and this horrible culture should not be allowed to come. Most of the women are nothing but they are like prostitutes. All children are drug addicts. Or alcoholic, the men are. They are not normal people. So, Sahaja Yogis have to produce our Sahaj culture, which brings peace, which brings joy and is based on innate morality.

I think this awakening is coming now to people in Russia. I’ve been there for a conference and in the conference, the subject was ‘Health, Morality and Peace’. So, these are very important points to make a nation solid. Not money, that comes automatically. So I told them that, “Don’t buy anything that comes from abroad”. Nothing imported we bought.

You’ll be amazed in India, you can’t buy even a pin from abroad. There’s no shop like that. Our Mahatma Gandhi told that, “Don’t get anything from abroad”. And so we have come up. Three hundred years, these British ruled us. They take away our gold, they take away our all-precious stones, everything. But now, India has come up by becoming Indians, that means by becoming patriotic, that will really give your children a very nice time.

I wish I could come for more time here. But somehow, I’ll go back. I wish that I am not running from place to place.

May God bless you all.
