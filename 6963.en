Talk to Sahaja Yogis. Vienna (Austria), 7 July 1986.

[I thank them] ...again for what they achieved in Guru Puja. The way the [autel ?] was arranged so beautifully and organized so beautifully, so that nobody felt any strain whatsoever.

Of course in Sahaja Yoga there are always ups and downs. As you have seen, we try to do our level best, but still sometimes you feel that there can be some mistakes we might have committed. But there's - it is not for you to be upset about it. Because once you have reached the shores of joy then you should not give it up for anything. Because it is own your choice whether you want joy or you want unhappiness. Now in this Guru Puja I felt everybody reached a very great height of achievement and have become the joy itself. Now whatever your past was, whatever mistakes you might have committed in the past in your ascent or whatever might have happened in the past because of others to you, is all lost in the past, the ocean of the past. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Aside: It's all right, let it be, leave it. It's all right. I won't need, it's all right.

But now you see when you reach a certain state then you should not allow anything of the past to come back. I would even suggest to give a challenge to the past.

(Advice to translator regarding microphone) Will be like this, you see, keep it like that is a good habit. Just you have to remember it, yes. (Shri Mataji laughing) Now after some time I have also learned how to use the mike. (Laughter)

Terrible they are, this one I know very well, you see, I mean, even if you speak there I have seen, that they move, you know, with you, as if - (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) you get frightened of that. (Laughter) Yeah, I know, all right.

So, you have to challenge the past. Huh, now you sit down here. Ah, now let's see what was the past, "Oh that one was, that one was, all right let's see that, gone to waste, finished, good for Nothing" - like that. Then you are fixed into this point. But even if you are afraid of the past, to look at it, "Oh God", and you feel funny (Laughter) or you get angry with yourself or you feel upset about it - then yet you have not reached the point. So now you have to see it that you are at a distance, that's why you are seeing it. Nothing can touch you.

So the judgment will come from you to yourself, "Am I still involved in the past that was last, that was yesterday, is finished now? Am I even now bothered about it?" And your Mother will also sometimes test you on that. (Shri Mataji laughing) Sometimes I may remind you of some mistake of yours and then see what happens to you. And then I will know where are My children. (Laughter) Now you have become the fruit, which is ripe. So why should you worry about things which you are not anymore? Now if you have become a full-fledged bird why should you worry about the egg that used to smell so badly. (Laughter) So this is the attitude one must have towards oneself, the confidence within yourself. So that's how you challenge your past, and now you can even challenge your future. Now start thinking what can happen to us, supposing. (Laughter) Which is very, very common nature of the western people. Yes, because if you tell somebody, "Now, will you please go and telephone to that person", immediately that person will tell you, "Perhaps he may not be there. (Laughter) Now let me see what's the time. This is the time he has to go out, so he must have gone out." (Laughter) But why don't you telephone? And you telephone and the fellow is there. This is the western style of futuristic explanations of everything.

(To the translator) Is that difficult?

Sahaja Yogini: It's a word which doesn't exist in German.

Shri Mataji: Which one? (Laughter)

Sahaja Yogini: Futuristic.

Shri Mataji: I mean, what do you say to future?

Sahaja Yogini: Zukunft.

Shri Mataji: Zukunft. And then make it into 'it' - that's all. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) You have to coin words now, what to do? (Shri Mataji laughing)

Now so, when you challenge your future - I've been always challenged by the people who were futuristic, all the time. Like - you tell them, "I want to do this." So they'll say, "But in that the problem is this." (Laughter) 'Problem' - you see, this is modern word. (Laughter) We never knew this word before for all these things, we used to only use it in geometry. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) Really, I am telling you the truth. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) Now this word geometry is, you see it was for proving something, you see that was a problem. So that's how we have proved, you see. All right, so now you see, then another thing you should say that, "All right this is the problem, so can you try this one." He'll say, "Then the problem is this." (Laughter) You give the solution another - another problem. By the time there are eleven solutions you are fagged out and you just sit down and you don't know what to say. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Now your mind has been doing the same thing with you. You see, that kind of a mind always tries to find problem because it doesn't want to solve. So as soon as it starts, wants to say he wants to go somewhere, to the station, immediately he said the word, "Problem is, there is no car." That means he starts quarrelling with himself all the time. His body is quarreling on one side, his heart is on another side, his mind on another side, liver is on another side. So as a result, at the end of the day you find all of them sitting, "Ha", (Laughter) doing nothing whatsoever, all exhausted, fighting with oneself. You see any film or any thing nowadays, the modern ones, you will find all of them in the film they'll come and sit down chair, "Ha". (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) But you see the trouble is, "What have we been doing? What work have we done? Nothing but thinking and figuring out."

Now you are Sahaja Yogis. You have to remember that God's all powers are with you. But only thing you have to be with Him. The powers are with you, but they are not going to run after you. (Laughter) I mean if you want to [regale ?] out of it, what can the powers do? So you have the powers of God.

I'll give you an example. There was once in My house, you see I had made a banister, a complete banister for the staircase. Laurent is here, he'll tell you. And I told him, "Laurent, that you fix it up and I'm resting for a while, because now all the Gods are sleeping. So I'll rest for about half an hour and you try to fix it up." And I was just lying down in the drawing room where he was fixing it up, you see. I got up after one hour still he was sitting with a hand like this. (Laughter) He was measuring this distance that distance, again going back to that and measuring it with very, very small calipers, you see. (Laughter) Did everything, and he was tired. (Laughter) I said, "All right, just lift this and fix it." And it fixed, it was fixed in a second. (Laughter) You see because I know I have God's powers. So what is it? If I say the wood has to increase or decrease - just fix it, that's all. (Laughter) (Explains for translator) What to expand, or...

So that's how, you see, the future we start thinking like this, "Now, let me figure it out, if it works out or not, when they fix me up?"  What is there? This is God's work, just fix it, it will fix. But still some people will linger on to think, "How can it be, Mother?" Now I'll tell you the secret. You are in the Brahma Shakti and this Brahma Shakti is the vibrations that you feel. It has all the creative power, it has all the destructive power, it has all the evolutionary power - it has all the powers we can say. And it's like a big computer, it uses whatever it wants to use. Now if you take a molecule of sulfur dioxide you'll find a sulfur has got two oxygens, you see, vibrating - tug, tug, tug - like that. They are different types. Some type isometric and all that - different, different types of vibrations, equal or unequal. These vibrations are Brahma Shakti and they exist in every matter whether dead or alive. So when you see that "fix", the wood knows the order has come and the vibrations in the molecules act.

(Problems of translator)

It's very interesting, everything, you see. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

So, this Brahma Shakti is everywhere. It penetrates into everything. And if you believe in God it acts in everything. But it's not blind belief. First, you have to be perfect Sahaja Yogi. Then you are one with the Brahma Shakti. You can control everything and you do not waste your energy in controlling nonsensical things. You don't want to become like a juggler, you see, creating a flower out of a thorn or sort of a thing. But wherever necessary, it works, it acts.

So you'll have experiences in life, one by one and you'll be amazed how things work out. And then you will realize that you are not an ordinary Sahaja Yogi. Whatever you have committed wrong in the past or whatever you used to think of the future - the present becomes Divine. And that Divine present is the ocean of joy, of which you are the part and particle. Just enjoy that! As I was telling you today, that then you don't think about who is the enjoyer and who is the creator. You just become the existence. Existence is the present. That is how it works out. Where you lose all words, all thoughts, all feelings, which are emotional type, an absolutely silent confidence you drink like nectar of life.

May God bless you all!

Have you got any question to ask Me?

Ask Me some questions, you know I have no questions here in My head. Any problems? (Laughter)

Any questions? No, not about yourself, about others you must ask. How to deal with them, how to answer their questions, you must be having problems dealing with others, not about yourself I am saying.

You can't even think. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Sahaja Yogini: May I ask one, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes please.

Sahaja Yogini: Yesterday just by chance one elderly lady was sitting near me and she struck a very long conversation with me to repeat and repeat one fact which was rather annoying but I had to listen in order to try and give an answer. And the fact was she said, "I am here, I came here because I am very interested in what is going on but I refuse to bend down - this is a personal cult."

Shri Mataji: She is an Italian lady?

Sahaja Yogini: From Rome, yes.

Shri Mataji: Ah... (applause) I know her very well. She is a possessed woman. You know she came to Me, she said, "My husband is a singer and I don't feel very happy with him." So I said, "All right you can bring him to Sahaja Yoga otherwise we can't do much." So she said, "With my love I can improve him." But I told her, "He is possessed and you are also possessed by him." (Laughter) She said, "How?" So I asked her to put her hand towards Me and her hand started shaking. (Shri Mataji laughing) So I put a paper on her hand and "See now", I said, "What is happening?" So she said, "This is emotional." I said, "Why is it Mine is not shaking, theirs not shaking, why yours only emotional?" (Laughter) So what happens that when such a person, you see, gets after your life and she asks many questions, there is no need to satisfy them. Just tell them, "You are a bhoot", that's all. (Laughter & applause) Yes, that's how, because that's the fact. And I told her that way. And if she says, "How do you say I am a bhoot", you tell her that, "You come and put your hand towards the photograph" and raise her Kundalini and she'll start [come up and down]. (Shri Mataji laughing) And then she - they will know that they are. So that's it was and - she tried everything but she failed because she had to bend and - (to a Yogi) you are great hero here, he just put her down - (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) and her Kundalini they could see very clearly was just going like that [Shri Mataji opens and closes Her hand].

So there are only two things, which do not want to bend before God. One is the bhoot or another is the ego. And today when I gave the lecture you can listen - make them listen to it because it's a very short one but very good one, it shows what is surrender. Surrender means your ego and your superego, your bhoots. And headache to Me. (Shri Mataji laughing) I really tell you some of them when they touch My feet I feel as if some scorpions or some snakes are biting Me. Sometimes I feel they are burning Me and I find blisters on My feet. So it is very kind of them that they don't want to touch My feet. (Laughter)

So that is how we have to have our confidence and we should know that if somebody is a pesterer that must be a bhoot, only the bhoots pester you, they have no self-respect. I would only suggest that such people should not come to Puja. But she was only one who was singled out.

Sahaja Yogis: [INAUDIBLE]

(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Shri Mataji: Oh God. She is terrible.

Sahaja Yogini: [My neighbor in the room had a bad Agnya ?]

Shri Mataji: Better to sleep in the corridor. (Laughter)

Sahaja Yogini: I did. (Laughter & applause)

Shri Mataji: How do I know? She is from Australia basically but now they worked in Sierra Leone, is a wonderful place you see. (Shri Mataji laughing) Then I said that you should have slept in the corridor (Laughter) and she said she did. (Laughter)

So it's worth enjoying. We are so many, we know the joke. (Laughter)

If somebody is curious and sensible and asking about something, "What is this? Why you are bowing to Her?" Supposing somebody says, "Why do you bow to Her, after all She is like a human being", supposing. So then you can say that, "That not because She was our Guru but She has given us Self Realization. And also it is said, only it is the Holy Ghost or the Adi Shakti you can give Self Realization like this en-masse. So we absolutely we have found out that She is the Holy Ghost. Now it's correct. So then also we have seen Her photographs, we have seen Her work, we have seen Her wonders, and now you better see that. The miracles of Christ were only seen by his disciples, but of Shri Mataji so many of us have seen it. And the way She has changed our lives why should we not bow to Her? What would you do yourself?"

Then the question is correct on her, on the other person. But the question has to be honest and sensible, not like the mad woman.

Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE] ...some question about Sierra Leone and I like to share the sweet story.

Shri Mataji: All right please. All right just open the door [Sandal ?] Yes please because you see, he has been there and you must really hear about that. And also what about the tape? You have it here. So you should expose it and let them have a look somewhere, it's a good idea.

We have big windows, but no breeze. Better order, send some order to the breeze.

Better. All right, let's have it.

Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]

Shri Mataji: You come and have this.

You understand that much English, don't you? Who does not understand English and only German, raise your hands?

Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]

Shri Mataji: At all. Who has the problem? Only one lady is there - all right. All right, so let him speak now.

Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji. The little story that I wanted to relate to you regarding our bowing to Mother came a few weeks after I was in Sierra Leone and a few of these native people had their Realization by then, and I asked them how they related to Shri Mataji. And they quickly explained to me that there was the Holy Trinity, which was the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. And they said that if there is a Father and a Son then the Holy Ghost has to be the Wife of God. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter & applause)

Because they live very, very much as a family and the woman is the basis of the family. She is so strong and she is so beautiful and demure and she holds the chastity so strong. So they related very quickly to Mother, and they came to Mother very, very fast. We couldn't believe. Christy had told me how the Indian women get on the trains, they get on like that very quick.

Shri Mataji: Jumping.

Sahaja Yogi: And these Africans get on to Sahaja Yoga like that - very quick. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Very true. Anywhere, you see Indians are very smart like that I must say.

Sahaja Yogi: The other thing that I would like to tell you which I think these people are going to teach us a lot of how to be very beautiful Sahaja Yogis is that every day they enquire as to, "How is your body?", that is how the conversation goes. They come to you and they say, "How is your body?" And the answer for that in the native tongue is [kayan goma ? ] and [kayan goma] means "Praise be to God". So they never answer that their body is sick or that they are not well or that they are happy or they are anything. They praise God because they are alive.

Shri Mataji: That's it. Straight forward. (Applause)

Sahaja Yogi: And the other question Shri Mataji, that I had was that Sierra Leone means 'mountain lion'. And it was always a questioning as to what significant this small, small country is, because on the mountain ranges there is one peak, which looks like a lion. So we always toyed with ideas as to what this place was for in the Divine play. So if You could help us Shri Mataji, we appreciate that. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: You see, if you say anything in the body about a country what it is, I mean you may like it but I don't like it very much Myself. I think of the Europe being the horrible liver, you see. (Laughter) Europe is so beautiful, but to call it the liver, but I have to tell you it's the liver. But liver is no good, horrible thing it is, liver. So, you see but there are some ductless glands also in the body, and one of them is this one - like pituitary and all that.

(To the translator) Hello, Mary, there's no need to have a technical word, it's not UN [United Nations]. (Shri Mataji laughing) It's not UN.

Just tell them, one of the ductless glands, which is without any ducts, means on the messages it works. It's like a remote control. Remote control - that sort of a thing it is. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, may I translate the stories of Peter.

Shri Mataji: Yes please.

[Sahaja Yogini translates]

Shri Mataji: That's it. Any other question now?

(Side B of the Tape)

Sahaja Yogini: How should we handle some category of people, say those very ego through all scientists, through all the status of Agnya, and want to carry a conversation on the level they are used to i.e. they'll want to dissect everything you tell them and insist on having answers. I'm having quite a full dozen on me and I feel...(Laughter.)

Shri Mataji : Another type

Sahaja Yogini: And I feel that all along I have been making the mistake of trying to convince them. Should I give it an answer?

Shri Mataji: It's very simple to understand you see, now if there are medical science or there're physical science. What sciences are they dealing with?

Sahaja Yogini: They are mostly physicists, nuclear physicists.

Shri Mataji: All right, so the nuclear physicists must be told on their language only, we can talk to them about this that, "The thing that physical laws, you see, act isn't it? There are so many laws, physical laws, which act in the physics. Now who has made the laws? (Laughter) You just see what is there, what laws are acting, that's what you see. But who has made the laws, who has bound them by the laws? See say hydro electric now, with the water falls from a particular height it releases energy, the energy becomes the thing. All right, you see that is happening from the energy getting transferred into this, into this. But who has made that in the water, who has put that law into that?" Now that is if you want to talk about God, "All right, there is something beyond it. But now we have to see that - where have we reached? When we started discovering science, the epitome of science is what - is hydrogen bomb, atomic bomb, or we can say computer. But we have not been able to produce any computer like a human being." This is second point.

All right, do tell them now, "But by the scientific advancements we have created people who are very imbalanced. They are so volcanic, they are so criminal, there is violence, the human beings are fighting among themselves, even the animals don't fight this way the way human beings fight."

Now so we reach a point. You take them to a point now that, "That's what we have achieved. What is the reason?" Rationalize it. "What is the reason, why human beings have not been benefited the way we want to benefit them? So, why scientific research has gone onto toward destructive research, why? So if you start judging that why we always end up like this, there must be some reason that the controlling point within us is missing. So there has been no integrated progress or all-sided progress. So if you see that, we have not progressed at all. Because the progress is to be only known how we relate to each other. For that even - there we should go to psychology, if it is a science - there is you who says that you have to become collectively conscious. And as scientist we must have open mind to see what other people who had perhaps higher awareness than human awareness have thought of it. So those who try to be benevolent on this Earth have said that, 'You have to have your second birth', every one of them. Also rationally we can see that we are not at an absolute point. Because we think this will do good. But ultimately doesn't do any good. And we commit so many mistakes also. The whole world is like a mess, one must admit a confusion.

So science can't solve it. At least one point is clear that you have to go beyond this human awareness to that position which is called as the Spirit. And as an open-minded scientist you must accept this hypothesis first. Before accepting the hypothesis if you argue, what can I tell you? That means you are not a scientist - simple. So now if you accept this hypothesis now the time has come to prove everything. As the tree of awareness has grown outside it must have grown inside also - to find out the roots. So let us see, keep your eyes open. If it works out and if you see that it works out in you, rather difficult but still, rather difficult and we can't promise, but if it works out you will know that you have a higher awareness of absolute value. It is not a challenge to any science, but it explains all sciences. So if you have this power within you why not get it, to be sensible enough?" The only problem with scientist is again that they think they are perfect, they want to work on others, not on themselves. Little humility can tell them that science has reached at no perfect point. "So, just be little humble and know that you have to know little more, because it actualizes on your central nervous system. Like in evolutionary process everything manifests on the central nervous system and so this also manifest and you do really become collectively conscious. So why not try? A scientist must try. That's what it is."

They think that now they have reached a point when either they have to jump down (Shri Mataji laughing) or they have to go back.

(To the Yogini, explaining 'jump down') Precipices, you see, they have to go.

"But you see the Kundalini ascends you. You don't have to go down or not, to recede back, She ascends you." This is what, this is how you talk to them. You tell them that, "You have to be sensible. And if you want to really do good to others and to yourself and to your progeny..."

Now for physics I'll give you one very good example. It can be chemistry, but on molecules, you see, it is. I was, I told once a very great scientist in America that a carbon atom is on one side looks like Om and on other side like a Swastika.

What do you say to carbon?

Sahaja Yogini: Kohlenstoff.

Shri Mataji: Kohlenstoff. Kohlenstoff. Kohlenstoff. (Laughter) Because we say [kolsa ?] in Marathi, we say [kolsa].

So they took the picture this is with a spectrographic picture of carbon atom. And when they saw from the left side they saw the right side, it was like Om. And when they saw from left they saw it to the right it was like a Swastika. Then they will ask another question, I am sure with this, that how this Swastika was used by Hitler. (Laughter) So because Lamas knew the trick, they told him about using the Swastika, because that is the sign of innocence. And he used them with the stencil, painted with stencil, many stencils, you see, stencil is a typical type, you see where you cut it out in a plate, a Swastika and then paint it on top.

(To the translator) Ah, "stancil" [german pronounciation]. You make anything ‘a’, it becomes ‘a’, you see: 'steel' you make 'Stahl', finished. One german principle is, you see, anything 'e' you become 'a'. You see, mother is - I'm 'e’ in Marathi - ‘e’ is the mother. So here they say ‘a’ because fatherland.

Sahaja Yogini: This is difficult to translate, I don't know how to say this, shall I translate this?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no need. (Laughter) German may not like it.

Then by chance - you see the stencil they were using the Divine played a trick in their brains. They got confused, you see. So they started painting the Swastika from the other way of the stencils. (Shri Mataji laughing) So the constructive or the positive Swastika became a destructive, negative one and they started losing. Even if you see Hitler's older pictures and later pictures you'll find he has two types of Swastikas. (Shri Mataji laughing) That's how they lost. Otherwise this world would have finished long time back with so many Hitler-like people came on this Earth.

And in modern times all fake Gurus have come, also some of the organized religions are there, destroying. Some are obviously fanatics and some are very sophisticatedly.

(To the translator) There's no word sophistication in German? (Laughter) You see, so because of them scientists do not believe in God, but God exists and we can prove it. That's what it is, it's simple.

So you can make them listen to this. Instead of arguing with them you said, "You better listen to this lecture." (Laughter) Because that will go on them. (Shri Mataji laughing) You see it's that simple as that, you put everything on your Mother, "Listen to Her, what She has to say, and then now ask questions, them (Shri Mataji laughing) - scientists."

Sahaja Yogini: Can you explain to them the new technique, "If you look from beneath, you'll see the cross"?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes I was telling them how to see that also - cross. But you see the trouble is that they don't have that kind of spectrometer so far. They don't have that kind. There is a, only on the sides you can see, not from down upward. That's the problem is. Also if they see from down below, see, you see it's a very practical thing you can understand, say this is carbon atom here, and it is, actually if you put the light from here [beneath] then you just see these flats are first reflected on this side, isn't it. But what you have to see is what is here [more aside]. So what it looks at this point you can't see practically.

Sahaja Yogini: Some Johan tried to build a three dimensional Swastika.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. I mean three dimensional Swastika to be made into look like, yes it does, it does look. But still I would say like this you think. I was suggesting to them, what they have to do is to put carbon here, all right and reflected onto this one like here, you see then reflected into another mirror there, reflected into another mirror so that you bring to this point, parallel. But you need many mirrors to do that. You see My point? This is something that you see like this, if you have to see like that at a right angle you will have to have mirrors after mirrors, isn't it. And still it won't be exact.

Sahaja Yogini: Can't we contact some of our astronomer who are very expert in using mirrors and building apparatus like that.

Shri Mataji: Yes, you might have to. But you will have to use lots of them you see, because by little, little angle you'll have to move to go at - something you know like that. It will be difficult. Say for example now this is a glass, all right. Now this portion - at the most I will not have water like that - now this portion [beneath] to be seen like that [in front]. Now will you show. So what you will have to do that this one has to be reflected on some thing little closer to this and this one reflected onto this one here then this one again with point, point, point to move - still it won't be exact, at an angle.

Sahaja Yogini: This is becoming very interesting Shri Mataji. Can I discuss this with some of my friends? Maybe they can find the equipment for it.

Shri Mataji: Rather difficult. You see, because even if you take a photograph [of the beneath portion] you'll get a photograph of this  [portion of its side]. But you have to have the photograph of this, when this thing has to stand up like that you see how will it look like. But it changes. Same carbon changes itself. It's not exactly the same when it turns round, the angle it changes, that's the point is. You see, that's the problem.

So, I mean, if two things are proved, the third must be accepted. (Laughter & applause)

In Sahaja Yoga also once I gave you Realization you accepted that, all right this means heart, this mean this, this mean this. Then you try. There are so many things I say which you accept. You may not have proof so far but, because at least 75% is proved. So 25% Mother is not going to tell us lies. (Laughter) Or else we can say like this the - whatever I have said, say in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, is very different - not different but it's so rudimentary, but what I said the other day in Guru Puja, I would not have said in the beginning, would I have? So you see the awareness also has to rise to understand it, you see. This is very important, because say - I can see supposing the light coming on Me. The camera also sees but you don't see - and if I tell you there's light coming on Me then you will think that, "Mother is trying to befool us." But you know that because I put My hand like this [to protect Her eyes] and I said, "No", like that it's clear-cut. So I knew that there was light. But now if you don't have the eyes that the camera has I should not tell you something like that. But supposing also now if I tell you, you will believe Me. So you see, this is about, if you, if you are saying something 75% correct and it's you have proved it, is 25% is to be learned later on.

But by believing in it nothing is going to be lost. But in believing in it you'll find it out also. That believing in that there is Kundalini in you, you have achieved your Realization. It has done good to you. It has transformed your life. So henceforth even if I tell you something it is better that you should understand that is for your good, so you would, you accept it. But there is one way of finding out for you. When I say the truth you get the vibrations. Even when I boast about Myself also you get tremendous vibrations. (Laughter)

(Shri Mataji laughing) They don't boast? In German you don't have a boast-word? (Laughter)

What's the word for 'boast'?

Sahaja Yogini: Angeben.

Shri Mataji: Angeben.

Sahaja Yogini: Angeberei.

Shri Mataji: Angeberei.

So when I say 'boast' really it's no boasting because vibrations start. So you can find out the truth, if I am telling the truth or not you can find out. But is it possible that when I am sitting here you don't feel vibrations? And if you are not getting vibrations, always it is wrong with you, not with Me. (Laughter) So how to find out whether I am telling the truth or not? (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) That is MahaMaya, you see, that is MahaMaya. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) So don't believe in Me, to be very frank. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) That's the conclusion. It's just a play, you see, just a play, just fun. You got word for 'fun'? (Laughter)

Sahaja Yogini: Spass.

Shri Mataji: Spass. But in French - nothing. (Laughter) Nothing in French for 'fun'.

Sahaja Yogini: There is.

Shri Mataji: Which one? Gregoire has told Me. (Shri Mataji laughing). So find out for 'fun' and for 'awareness'. 'Awareness' is there?

Sahaja Yogini: Bewusstsein - in French: conscience.

Shri Mataji: Conscience - now, 'awareness' is different - 'consciousness' that is.

Sahaja Yogini: Bewusstsein.

Shri Mataji: You see, I will lose 400 pounds to My husband. (Laughter) Please find it, he won't know. He will never give Me, in any case. (Shri Mataji laughing) I can charge him interest. But that also he wouldn't give Me. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

All right, very nice meeting you, all of you. And as - we are all friends together here, after the Guru Puja's pressure now today we are all friends. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Any problems you have, you'll let Me know. But one thing one has to remember, to try not to create problems, not to create any stupid things - just let God manage everything for you and handle it. He'll do it very well. So don't be in a weeping condition or in a dominating condition or in a quarreling condition. But be nice and sweet to each other. Express your love fully and well. And you will get it back in full measure.

Thank you very much!

Good night!
