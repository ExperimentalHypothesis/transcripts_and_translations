Seminar, Dedication Through Meditation, Morning

Please be seated.So nice to see you all here.This time now again is to have a very informal talk between the Mother and Her children, you can say. And for that, I was thinking of getting about five or six people from various countries to be seated here, and who all -Hello, how are you?Sahaja Yogi: Very good Mother.Shri Mataji: Nice to see you.

Who’ll ask questions to them. And I want to watch what sort of questions you ask, what sort of answers you get. And of course, I'll also be able to answer some of the questions.

And how to answer the question of a person who is not yet Realized, is half-baked, and how to handle the situation. We have to learn, that is very important. Because you have to know that negativity is in complete force all the time. And we have to face the negative ideas, negative people, negative plans. And when they plan, it is necessary – please, come, all of you-It is necessary for all the Sahaja Yogis that they should be equipped-- Move forward.Sahaja Yogi: Come forward.

Shri Mataji: They should be so equipped that they should be able to face sometimes [inaudible]. There can be many like that you meet, who are seekers, who have been seeking, who have been doing lots of mistakes and who have conditioning problems and it's not easy that kind of confrontation you get. Then also you get some funny sort of people who are in Sahaja Yoga for some time and somehow, they cannot manage to get up. Very low graded people I should say. And really, you get disgusted with them. That's the second style of people. Because God's work today is to save as many people as possible, that's the work we have to do. But there are all kinds of mental projections and hangs-up and all that.And the first thing they do to attack is a question. Then there are suggestions. Then there can be actual fighting.

I had such a one very recently which I must tell you, the most interesting one. That’s Peggy and you know Peggy, how she is. Nobody needs worry about her. The kind of a quality she is, you know, we have told her that we don't want her anymore. In Sahaja Yoga, we do not ask people to come. They come to us, we don't force them, and if they are hopelessly bad then we say, "All right, we've had enough of it now, please forgive us". And they get out of Sahaja Yoga, you see, mostly, this is how it works out.Because we have to choose, you see, that’s what we have to do with people. There can be very high-quality people and there can be very cheap type of people also.Now, Peggy everybody knows has been with us for five or six years. And she has been to horrible places and has a funny type of a personality, I don't know. If God has made her, I don't know how He has made her that way. She's been to all kinds of wrong stuff, absolutely horrible things, filthy, dirty. She has been a married woman with three children who are Realized souls.Now my interest was in her about her children because we knew about her but her children were very good. And when she came to Me, I told her that, "See, we can't do much about you, I'm sorry. But in a way, but you have to work hard if you are willing to cooperate" "Oh, I'm willing to cooperate, Mother, I want to say I’m willing to."Then I discovered that she was actually ill-treating her husband, ill-treating her children. Every time I tried to raise her Kundalini, it was a big labouring thing, I mean it's a very hard work with such people. I used to say, "Oh God I hope next time I don't see her face somehow, it's too much". And the whole attention goes to something so nonsensical and useless person. I mean, in that time we can give Realization to so many people. And she would attract the sympathy of some here and there. Then ultimately, I raised her Kundalini thrice and I told her, "You’ve got, you've touched your Realization but you have to now promise Me that you will not ill-treat your husband and not ill-treat your children". And she said, "Mother you have to promise me that my Realization will be established". I said, "All right, promised, but you must promise Me this. Start it that way.

Imagine to be ill-treating your own husband and your own children! I mean, I haven’t got sufficient time to be with my children, to express my love. And here is a person, sitting down quietly with three children and just thinking how to torture them. A very difficult case I felt with this woman. Very fond of living like a lady-like personality, this and that. But she couldn't do that. Every time her Kundalini fell down. You see, she used to think that she's obliging Me all the time, that's her funny stuff. And she thought that I promised her and how is it not established? And then, I think people told her that you better not come to Sahaja Yoga, we have had enough. She stopped the children, she never brought them. I said, "All right".

But, you see, negativity is such that they know they have no personality. Otherwise, without Sahaja Yoga what is their personality? They are nothing. So, she tried to assert herself all the time and this time she appeared where we had gone and she just came by herself. I never called her nor asked her to come but she was there. And I asked Rita, how is she here? She said, "Mother she is here because she said that You told her". I said, "I?" She said, "Yes, You were in her head and told her". I’m neither in her heart nor in her head [laughter]. So, how am I going to tell her? So, she came.

Question: What to say to somebody who comes up and says very concernedly: ‘what is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and these...?’

Shri Mataji: What’s it?

Man: What’s the difference between what You are doing and what these cults or these other gurus are doing? The all seem saying the same thing...?

Shri Mataji: ‚They are using the same language... Ah, you see, because in 1970 I was in America, they have picked up everything. And a gentleman told Me, warned Me. He told Me: ‚Mother, You better get all your tapes – what you call them? – copyrights, you see. I said: ‚Why?’ He said: ‚No, this audio words vibrations this, that, will used by these people, chakras and all...’ I said: ‚Very good!’ But ultimately they have to come for realization. But they are using the same... - doesn’t matter. Now, tell him. What’s the difference between the technique of Sahaja Yoga and the technique of these people? They use the same words.

Shri Mataji requests the Yogis and Yoginis to answer to the question.

(24:50) Answer of the Yogis and Yoginis.

(35:30) Shri Mataji: You see, always the artificial has to copy the real. It is always so. Artificial has to copy the real, otherwise you can't sell. Of course outwardly in the gross we can say that artificial can sell, the real is spontaneous. Or artificial can put up a show, the real does not. The artificial is more earnest because it has to sell while the real is disbothered [? word ambiguous] as he said about Me. It’s correct. But beyond that, how to make out an artificial from the real is the problem, because they have the same style of thing and these people say that we are doing the same thing, we are having vibrations, we have energy, we are raising the Kundalini, everything we do. Now the best thing would be to be extremely practical with this people. First of all you must judge whether they are seekers or not. Then you should see what chakras are catching. See, you move on another line. They move on another line because you are empowered. So you just see what chakras are catching on them.

If you answer them directly, they will come out with another answer. So, when they say something to you, you must know that if they are bhoots and they are possessed then they know your bhoots also, not only that, but they are read your mind, that’s one of the powers of bhoot. Because they can live on mental level, they can live on physical level, they can live on other levels like they have seen whatever past you have had they can tell you. They can [...] that. They can [...].They can tell you about your future, they can tell about past, they can tell about your mental problems, your brother, father. They can even tell you where you have lost your properties or where you have kept your ornaments and who is the ring. All these things they can tell. Because their interest is material, so they know everything about it and they can tell you.

Now you have facing a person like that. So he reads your mind, all right. So, when he – you confront such a person, to deal with a person is to just kept quiet. Get into your thoughtless awareness. Be quiet. Your fortress is your thoughtless awareness because your are read (?). And try to see his Kundalini. Try to raise it and see where it stops. Now, he says: ‘Why don’t you answer?’ ‘See, I’m, still let me hear, let me hear’ All right? So show all the patience. Try to raise his Kundalini. Now if the Kundalini – see it is absolutely useless, it doesn’t rise you can say: ‘All right, I give up. Finish!’ Nothing would happen. Our real nature as he said he loose (?). There is a word for the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’. She doesn’t get attached to anyone. She cannot. If She is the energy for the whole universe, how can She get attached to anyone to any person at all? Only She can nourish and the nourishment can only go to a person who is willing to take a nourishment. You are on the giving stage, you are not on the thinking stage. If the other person doesn’t want to have it you can’t open the mouth and pour it in. So when such a question comes in you just go into your meditating mood and you will be amazed that the dynamism of the spirit will [...] there at that time. Now, maybe it stops at nabhi. Supposing the question at nabhi stops. On the right. So you know, he is a liver patient. All right? You can ask him questions about liver. He’ll be amazed that you know that he has a liver trouble. It stops at right heart. You just ask him a question about right heart. You just tell him these things, then I’ll tell you about this.

(40:57) Like, I tell you Douglas. Douglas is not such an intellectual, [...]. And they [...], you see. Just see My photograph, they do contortions (Shri Mataji whirl Her hands) and he telephoned in the ashram and Douglas received it. He said: ‘Who are you?’ He said: ‘I’m Douglas, I’m a Sahaja Yogi.’ ‘Really, what this Sahaja Yoga is?’ He said: ‘By the way are you perspiring too much?’ He said: ‘Yes I’m boiling (while) talking to you.’ He said: ‘That’s it. Have you been to TM?’ He said: ‘Yes, how do you know?’ ‘I know, because your chakras are catching.’ He said: ‘Surprising, these people can tell you.’ These don’t be [...] and you start open the book, I think he took My name or I think, or he took the name of the Goddess or whatever it is. And he just went in this contortions again. He said: ‘What have you started?’ Actually he got frightened [,,,] phoned to Me: ‘Mother, [...]

So, your powers are divine powers. Never forget that. On arguments, then once you have given them realization then start argument with them. But you can do it with your attention. You give them realization and then the arguments can given.

Because when I’m discussing with them actually I’m raising their Kundalini. Outwardly I’m discussing you see, everybody think Mother is talking, this, that [...] sometimes - but I’m really raising their Kundalini inside. So, first of all try to raise their Kundalini, because that works. Now, you know for definite what is the difference between the real and the unreal. That unreal is that a myth, – that: ‘This is a snake’ – it’s a myth. But when the light comes in you know it is not. The light has come to you. Even small children as they said, they know. You have got your own powers, no doubt about it. You can raise your Kundalini, no doubt about it. You can raise others Kundalini, no doubt. You can cure people, no doubt. For that if I have to give an example I have even cured the president of India. (43:39)

Now even that may not such a [...]. Then coming to the mental side of it, how you have achieved you know, you have given up all habits, then you have become a better person. While people who belong to other cult the don’t have give up any habits. On the contrary they become just slaves. Just slaves, they are not [...] as he said they are not [...] They become all slaves together and behave - collectivity to them is just slavery. Apart from that your knowledge is tremendous. You know why you do puja, you know why you make mantras, you know what mantras to say, when to say how to raise it and the whole science you do. Even their gurus never do the science that you do. All the technique Nirmala Vidya [...].

So, all the points that they have said, you have your own powers. You can ask them: ‘Can you feel me?’ ‘Yes, yes, we are feeling very hot.’ That’s all. But you should say: ‘I’m feeling you. You have been to such and such guru.’ Then your power to give him realization. Also later on can be told and show how to give realization. You should say: ‘Now you try to give me realization.’ You say: ‘All right, you give me realization.’ It‘s like [...] All right I will give you. ‘Will you allow me?’ Supposing he accept this. Finished! Then he is finished now. Once he is realized then he want talk. So you have to be very understanding of the situation. That first of all you are a realized soul, you have your own powers, the whole divine is behind you. [...] With all confidence just face the person. First going to meditative mood, [...] up your powers. And see that you raise his Kundalini, bring him to some point of report. Then this points one by one as this maybe they have suggested all right (?). But before raising them, discussion will lead to discussion. And it’s a headache [...]. I just do it because I don’t get a headache. You people don’t do it. I’m nothing to with the people who cannot be brought to a certain level of understanding. And they themselves will be impressed by your personality, by your methods. In your quiet way you should say: ‘Ha, this is..., ha!’ – like that, go on say: ‘Yes, yes.’ So he think, that he is impressing you, also you are listening to him [...]. That also pleases them [...]

Then now: ‘Thoroughly let me see where is your Kundlaini. Let me see. See around him. All right, now say what you have to say. Again say: ‘I’m not to [...]’. And at the back, raise it. Because if you cannot take out some [...] you have to pur your finger in around [...] way to take it out. [...] Kundlaini doesn’t won’t rise, we have nothing to do with such horrible people. So first of all you must judge the other person, raise his Kundalini, work it out and then once he has got it, then [...] All right [...]? You know the technique. So everyone whatever they have said, [...] and first class as we have said it. Warren is very [...] and all this points must be brought in but when we have brought them to a certain level established. Otherwise they just wobbling their heads or they will be deny you. Its total useless. But definitely you know your knowledge.

Now, second question. (48:31)

(39:59)
 So, when such a question comes in you just get into your meditative mood and you’ll be amazed the dynamism of the spirit will [...] in at that [...]. Now when it stops at Nabhi. Supposing the question at Nabhi stops, on the right. So, you know here is a liver patient. All right? You can ask him questions about liver. He’ll be amazed that you know that he has a liver trouble. It stops at right heart. You just ask him a question about right heart. You just tell him these things then I’ll tell you about this.

(45:28) ‚Will you allow me?’ Supposing he accepts this. Finish! Then he is finished now. Once he is realized then he won’t talk. So you have to be very understanding of the situation. That first of all, you are a realized Soul, you have your own powers and the whole divine is behind you. Don’t forget. With all confidence just face the person. First going to meditative mood, [...] up to your powers. And see that you raise his Kundalini, bring him to some point of report. Then this points one by one as this maybe which they have suggested are all right. But before raising them ... [sounds like ‘espacion’] we need to discussion. And it’s a headache [...]. I just do it because [...] a headache. You do may not do. I have nothing to do with people which cannot be brought to a certain level of understanding. And they themselves will be impressed by your personality by your [...]. In your quiet way you should say: ‘Ha! This is. Ha’. Like that. Go on say ‚yes, yes’. So he think that he is impressing you, also you are listening [?]. That was ... [?]. Then now: ‚Let me see where is his Kundalini? Let me see.’ See you around him. ‘All right, all right’, now say what you have to say. I’m not to ... [?] and at the back raise it. Because if you cannot take out some ... [incomprehensible – background noise] you have to take your finger in a round ... [?] way to take it out.
