Seminar, Dedication Through Meditation, Morning

Please be seated.So nice to see you all here.This time now again is to have a very informal talk between the Mother and Her children, you can say. And for that, I was thinking of getting about five or six people from various countries to be seated here, and who all -Hello, how are you?Sahaja Yogi: Very good Mother.Shri Mataji: Nice to see you.

Who’ll ask questions to them. And I want to watch what sort of questions you ask, what sort of answers you get. And of course, I'll also be able to answer some of the questions.

And how to answer the question of a person who is not yet Realized, is half-baked, and how to handle the situation. We have to learn, that is very important. Because you have to know that negativity is in complete force all the time. And we have to face the negative ideas, negative people, negative plans. And when they plan, it is necessary – please, come, all of you-It is necessary for all the Sahaja Yogis that they should be equipped-- Move forward.Sahaja Yogi: Come forward.

Shri Mataji: They should be so equipped that they should be able to face sometimes [inaudible]. There can be many like that you meet, who are seekers, who have been seeking, who have been doing lots of mistakes and who have conditioning problems and it's not easy that kind of confrontation you get. Then also you get some funny sort of people who are in Sahaja Yoga for some time and somehow, they cannot manage to get up. Very low graded people I should say. And really, you get disgusted with them. That's the second style of people. Because God's work today is to save as many people as possible, that's the work we have to do. But there are all kinds of mental projections and hangs-up and all that.And the first thing they do to attack is a question. Then there are suggestions. Then there can be actual fighting.

I had such a one very recently which I must tell you, the most interesting one. That’s Peggy and you know Peggy, how she is. Nobody needs worry about her. The kind of a quality she is, you know, we have told her that we don't want her anymore. In Sahaja Yoga, we do not ask people to come. They come to us, we don't force them, and if they are hopelessly bad then we say, "All right, we've had enough of it now, please forgive us". And they get out of Sahaja Yoga, you see, mostly, this is how it works out.Because we have to choose, you see, that’s what we have to do with people. There can be very high-quality people and there can be very cheap type of people also.Now, Peggy everybody knows has been with us for five or six years. And she has been to horrible places and has a funny type of a personality, I don't know. If God has made her, I don't know how He has made her that way. She's been to all kinds of wrong stuff, absolutely horrible things, filthy, dirty. She has been a married woman with three children who are Realized souls.Now my interest was in her about her children because we knew about her but her children were very good. And when she came to Me, I told her that, "See, we can't do much about you, I'm sorry. But in a way, but you have to work hard if you are willing to cooperate" "Oh, I'm willing to cooperate, Mother, I want to say I’m willing to."Then I discovered that she was actually ill-treating her husband, ill-treating her children. Every time I tried to raise her Kundalini, it was a big labouring thing, I mean it's a very hard work with such people. I used to say, "Oh God I hope next time I don't see her face somehow, it's too much". And the whole attention goes to something so nonsensical and useless person. I mean, in that time we can give Realization to so many people. And she would attract the sympathy of some here and there. Then ultimately, I raised her Kundalini thrice and I told her, "You’ve got, you've touched your Realization but you have to now promise Me that you will not ill-treat your husband and not ill-treat your children". And she said, "Mother you have to promise me that my Realization will be established". I said, "All right, promised, but you must promise Me this. Start it that way.

Imagine to be ill-treating your own husband and your own children! I mean, I haven’t got sufficient time to be with my children, to express my love. And here is a person, sitting down quietly with three children and just thinking how to torture them. A very difficult case I felt with this woman. Very fond of living like a lady-like personality, this and that. But she couldn't do that. Every time her Kundalini fell down. You see, she used to think that she's obliging Me all the time, that's her funny stuff. And she thought that I promised her and how is it not established? And then, I think people told her that you better not come to Sahaja Yoga, we have had enough. She stopped the children, she never brought them. I said, "All right".

But, you see, negativity is such that they know they have no personality. Otherwise, without Sahaja Yoga what is their personality? They are nothing. So, she tried to assert herself all the time and this time she appeared where we had gone and she just came by herself. I never called her nor asked her to come but she was there. And I asked Rita, how is she here? She said, "Mother she is here because she said that You told her". I said, "I?" She said, "Yes, You were in her head and told her". I’m neither in her heart nor in her head [laughter]. So, how am I going to tell her? So, she came in.

Now, I found that Rita had a weakness for this lady. So, something was to be done because I wanted to save Linda. My foot went absolutely crazy with this lady, I told her not to come in, what to do?But the Divine has its own methods and she suddenly got exposed completely. And Rita was shocked with the way she was. Because she just started fighting with Me, absolutely fighting with Me. And so rude and so shameless. Rita couldn't believe her eyes. So, I was very happy in a way, she said, "[inaudible] is over, " because she was always pestering me. And I told her that, "If Mother doesn't want and if it is not allowed, how can I do it? And she always used to say, "Do this, do that".

Now, why I am telling you this story is that when she went to India, everybody resisted her. And in England, you see, Sahaja Yogi come, you know, are very eager to develop Sahaja Yogis and she was literally frightened of them because she was quite aware of the nonsense that she was having and her cunning and all that. And it came up to this point with the way she behaved there and the way she created scenes and things and all such nonsense, that they said to Me, "We are going to book her back. She has to go back otherwise, we throw her in the sea, Mother we can't have her." [Shri Mataji is laughing] I said, "It’s all right".

Now, the main thing that we have to understand is that how much time do we spend with these people? We must learn how much, we must judge the depth of a seeker. That's very important because we haven't got time to waste much. And if you don't get anybody in England anymore, let's go to India. If not, India let's go to China. We have to gather human beings; we are not bothered as to what country them come from. You have to weigh first of all the quality and you'll find, you’ll be amazed, those people who think to be very much qualified, you'll find them to be useless people. And the Divine will not help you. The best part is that the Divine will not help you. It will be angry with you for wasting your time on such a person. And as you will be growing, you will definitely use this discrimination within yourself and you will understand. You will not waste your energy with someone like that.

All these ideas of being kind to everyone is not for us. We have to be kind to ourselves and to God. All such useless people have to go out of the circulation of evolution. Absolutely, there is no doubt about it. This is what I want to tell you that today I want you to ask the questions. That's important. And when you’ll ask the questions, I will see how they answer.

Now to be positive, a person has to see how the question is asked and how it is answered. It's not a question of your mind, it's a question of spirituality. The question is from spirituality to spirituality. It's not from one mind to another mind, and I would like to see that how it works out with Sahaja Yogis. Because I know you are people of very high quality and that’s how I know all this great work will be done. In one year, I have seen people they have come up so much. They have come up so much, they have gone so much up and they have done so much. But there are some who are struggling and they cannot come up. Some people don't feel vibrations, it doesn't matter. Need not feel vibrations constantly, maybe some physical problem is there or some sort of problem is there. But the main thing is the attitude of a person is important and negative people are there to take our time, to divert our attention. They’ll go into tantrums and show-off, they’ll do this, they’ll do that, and they'll try to divert out attention to them, attention from the Spirit, attention from our ascent, attention from our work that is so important, the emancipation of the whole humanity. So, we must understand that our lives are valuable lives. We are Sahaja Yogis. We are workers of God. Our Kundalini has risen, we are Realized souls of a very high quality and we have not to waste our energy to people who do not deserve our attention. That's very important, between you and Me, I am telling you this story. It's all right what I do. It's different, I play quite a lot of things with them. And I see to it that they get out. But you please don't waste your energy. If you find somebody difficult, funny, better give up that person.

Now with this idea, we’ll have about one person from every country. They'll sit down here and I would like to see. You should all ask questions. Questions, not material, but about Kundalini, about what answer to be given because now as you are going in the fields, you know people ask you questions, and what questions they ask, and how to answer these questions, so we can sort it out just now. Because sometimes, they can be so aggressive that you can be just dumbfound. But as I said, after a certain time, you should just give them up as lost. It's not our responsibility to give Realization to everyone. It's not expected. It's only those who deserve that will get it. It's the deserving quality of people that’s important. If they are not deserving, we are not interested in them. We are sufficient already. Better-- I always say that those people who are to enter into the Kingdom of God should only enter and not every Dick, Tom, and Harry. It's important. So, those people who cause problems, just do it to because they attract our attention.And Sahaja Yoga, you know, as it is, it’s very different from other so-called organizations of God. Here the genuineness is judged by vibrations and by attitude of yourselves. You have to be extremely positive. I've seen even some cancer patients who came to Sahaja Yoga who are so very positive, it’s surprising. And some people, for nothing at all, they’re wasting your time and energy. So, the interest should be for the people who are of [that] quality and not for people who are just wasting our time and energy. It's a kind of an ego within us there I think that we try to correct people who are good for nothing. We cannot. It's all right, they are hard nuts, but why do we need to break our teeth for that?

This is what I want to tell you. After this experience, now, Rita has said, taken a vow that she’ll have nothing to do with Peggy. And she always used to peg her down to Me every time. Rita used to telephone to Me about her, she used to tell Me, "Mother please look after her, all the Sahaja Yogis are angry [laughter]". Especially, she said, "People have told her off and cannot come to the programs". That's how it was. So, thank God now she's corrected. I’ve tried my own ways. But you can directly understand and know that you know in your heart who is settled and who is not settled. You know very well about everyone. You are quite capable. But if you try to be extreme, "Now, let it be, let it be, it's all right". They are no good. They can never come out. So why waste your energy? Simple thing is that whether you are good or bad, or if your heart is like that-- just the same. As Sahaja Yogis, we have to realize our position. The work is very important. It's not that we are here for England or America or for China, we are for the whole world. Whenever we can get people of that quality, we are going to collect and decamp. All right?[laughter]Now. So, I would say that we get some people here, like from every country that- you’ll be there.Sahaja Yogi: Mother, maybe Bryan could come first.Shri Mataji: Bryan also. No, Bryan should ask the questions first of all, then I will put you down in his place and he can switch.[laughter].

Shri Mataji: All right. Then, now we’ve got Kamala [unsure] from England and we have to answer, you see. Everybody has to answer because it’s a ‘one answer’. Then I think Steve can come from America. Marie can come from France. [Olga?] you come from Switzerland. All right, now nobody is higher or lower. You see, they’ll ask questions that have to be asked. Need not be answered. It cannot be answered? One should not worry. But anyone of you can answer the question.Now there are so many intelligent and intellectuals [laughter] and over-educated people sitting here. The ones who have to ask the questions are always better placed than the people who have to answer. All right? So, in a way I would like to see how the questions are asked and what answer is given. I would like to see the game.

All right. Can you ask to get Me something?Sahaja Yogi: A cup of tea? Would one of the ladies get Mother a cup of tea please?Shri Mataji: Now, yesterday's speech was really good. [Inaudible]

Yes, come along and sit. Ah, you must know, there are great intellectuals sitting here [laughter]. Be careful, all right. So, we are very friendly and niceWho else from which countries are here? Spain?Sahaja Yogi: Mother, there’s Robert's from Belgium.Shri Mataji: Is he there, Robert?Marie: Yes. Robert?Shri Mataji: Robert, come along, come along.

I’m so happy to know what you've done! Really remarkable, I must say this. Robert, I really say: what a man![Laughter and applause]. Do you remember how we shot off, you see, that horrible Rajneesh [Osho]? From there he came in, how we shot off! Remember him? [Inaudible]I'm very proud of you.Robert: Thank you Mother. My ego is going into this.Shri Mataji: That’s good. Ego is the same one. That should be the right type of ego.[laughter]. That type, that ego is a better type where you question the wrong type of a person. But that ego which questions the right type of person is a stupid ego because it has no sense, it has no wisdom. But, you see, for him to come, it’s hell I tell you, you see, he's sickening, he's very sickening, he sickens people. How horrid. Most of the people whom I know who were living about, say, from the beginning of it must have ended up in a lunatic asylum, most of them. Or, [inaudible], another thing I must tell you. Those, don there, have been doing this for years [inaudible],Robert: I saw pictures of him, recent pictures, and he wears -Sahaja Yogis: Gloves?Robert: Yes. He wears now gloves.Shri Mataji: Why?Robert: And big warm gloves. I think he is crazy.[Laughter].Robert: And I had vomited from this picture.Shri Mataji: Let him not die because otherwise he will be more troublesome. It’s all right.

All right, now, please make yourself comfortable.Now, most of the people who are real Sahaja Yogis should ask questions and not those who are yet too weeks and formless, all right? Because they, still I know they, they have to reach a certain stage of understanding. All right, from Sahaja Yogis only. Don't become thoughtless aware. [Laughter].Sahaja Yogi: You said not mind to mind.Shri Mataji: All right. Not mind to mind either. But let the inspiration come. [Inaudible]

In India, you’ve led the day to day life and you have been facing other people in Sahaja Yoga. You should ask questions about that, what are the questions they have asked, what was the problem. Now, for this, why do you think you have to that way? All right?Because, you see, now we should sit there all the time. [Unsure] It would be nice expressions. [Laughter]. All right? Three on this side and three on [inaudible]Let's have it now. Ah, that’s it, that’s a good idea.Now, come along.Yes, please.

Sahaja Yogi: What to say to somebody who comes up and says very concernedly: ‘what is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and these-’Shri Mataji: What is it?

Sahaja Yogi: What’s the difference between what you are doing and what these cults or these other gurus are doing? They all seem saying the same thing, I mean, they do.

Shri Mataji: Say‚ they are using the same language.Sahaja Yogi: Using the same language.Shri Mataji: Ah, you see, because in 1970, I was in America, they have picked up everything. And a gentleman told Me, warned Me. He told Me: "Mother, You’d better get all your tapes " – or what you call them?Sahaja Yogis: Copyrights.Shri Mataji: Copyrights! You see. I said: "Why?" He said: "No, this audio words ‘vibrations’ this, that, will used by these people, ‘chakras’ and all". I said: "Very good!" But ultimately, they have to come to Me for Realization. But they are using the same, I agree with you but doesn’t matter. Now, tell him: What’s the difference between the technique of Sahaja Yoga and the technique of these people? They use the same words.[Sahaja Yogini refuses]Let’s have another person, who? Warren?[Laughter]Warren: All the basic differences, I feel Mother is that, in Sahaja Yoga, it’s not the promise of an experience it’s the actualization. Something actually happens in the presence of Mataji or other Realized souls. And you get it.Another Sahaja Yogi: They also make experiences.Shri Mataji: They have their experiences. Now, let’s see.Marie: One thing that you can explain is whether they keep the freedom of the individual or whether the individual is actually maneuvered. And you can explain.Shri Mataji: 

How exactly would you know [unsure]? Then how [inaudible] by mesmerized or not by mesmerized?Marie: Yes, if you are in Sahaja, then you don’t know. But if you look for and you’re asking, you can ask the people to see how does it work, do you feel that these people are free in what they are doing? Do you feel that they doing it out their own freewill? Do they look like individuals? If you go there, are you taught to think for yourself? And is it something where your freedom is respected. Because a lot of the other ones you can explain that to people is that people are taken in charge and they are taken in charge morning till evening and even during the night. They never have to learn and they do this, do that, sing and pray and do whatever and they never stop. And they’re actually made to fit into a mould and once they are nicely shaped, they can’t out of it.Shri Mataji: You mean they don’t understand what they are doing?Marie: Eventually, they don’t. They’re fitted into something and it’s some weakness from their left side which make them want to be led. And it’s something that you still find in Sahaja Yogis, if you look carefully in yourself, we all still got that. And we all have to be careful of it. Because it’s still there, this tendency to want to fit into an organisation, be a “something” [inaudible][Shri Mataji is laughing.]Marie: And not be who you are.Shri Mataji: Yes.Marie: And go through with it, go and look at yourself and go through with it. And that’s the way it works, people are told that you, you know, are talking nice and all this, and all that. But basically, they are taken in charge. And then they don’t think for themselves. And the language, yes, is correct, but you have to see the results. If you want facts, there are plenty of facts, and these people got files and a [inaudible] of files [unsure] on what happened to people going there and if you managed to get them out, if ever. And that’s were the difference is.Shri Mataji: It’s very big, you know, the Sahaj is not being different, it’s rather being? I should say.All right, let’s see what [?] has to say.Sahaja Yogini: There are two points that we usually make. One is that you can’t pay for it and then you don’t pay for it. And this especially, comes up in America because there are people who used to pay for absolutely everything-Shri Mataji: Anything happens in America.Sahaja Yogini: You go to this introduction, to that introduction, quite always that way. It’s not like over here.Shri Mataji: All right.Sahaja Yogini: So, that’s something that attracts a lot of people if there are used to pay for things, you know, if this is a sort of wage there. And you say, "You cannot pay for it; we won’t accept things".

( not yet verified after 28:45; )

[...]

(35:30) Shri Mataji: You see, always the artificial has to copy the real. It is always so. Artificial has to copy the real, otherwise you can't sell. Of course outwardly in the gross we can say that artificial can sell, the real is spontaneous. Or artificial can put up a show, the real does not. The artificial is more earnest because it has to sell while the real is disbothered [? word ambiguous] as he said about Me. It’s correct. But beyond that, how to make out an artificial from the real is the problem, because they have the same style of thing and these people say that we are doing the same thing, we are having vibrations, we have energy, we are raising the Kundalini, everything we do. Now the best thing would be to be extremely practical with this people. First of all you must judge whether they are seekers or not. Then you should see what chakras are catching. See, you move on another line. They move on another line because you are empowered. So you just see what chakras are catching on them.

If you answer them directly, they will come out with another answer. So, when they say something to you, you must know that if they are bhoots and they are possessed then they know your bhoots also, not only that, but they are read your mind, that’s one of the powers of bhoot. Because they can live on mental level, they can live on physical level, they can live on other levels like they have seen whatever past you have had they can tell you. They can [...] that. They can [...].They can tell you about your future, they can tell about past, they can tell about your mental problems, your brother, father. They can even tell you where you have lost your properties or where you have kept your ornaments and who is the ring. All these things they can tell. Because their interest is material, so they know everything about it and they can tell you.

Now you have facing a person like that. So he reads your mind, all right. So, when he – you confront such a person, to deal with a person is to just kept quiet. Get into your thoughtless awareness. Be quiet. Your fortress is your thoughtless awareness because your are read (?). And try to see his Kundalini. Try to raise it and see where it stops. Now, he says: ‘Why don’t you answer?’ ‘See, I’m, still let me hear, let me hear’ All right? So show all the patience. Try to raise his Kundalini. Now if the Kundalini – see it is absolutely useless, it doesn’t rise you can say: ‘All right, I give up. Finish!’ Nothing would happen. Our real nature as he said he loose (?). There is a word for the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’. She doesn’t get attached to anyone. She cannot. If She is the energy for the whole universe, how can She get attached to anyone to any person at all? Only She can nourish and the nourishment can only go to a person who is willing to take a nourishment. You are on the giving stage, you are not on the thinking stage. If the other person doesn’t want to have it you can’t open the mouth and pour it in. So when such a question comes in you just go into your meditating mood and you will be amazed that the dynamism of the spirit will [...] there at that time. Now, maybe it stops at nabhi. Supposing the question at nabhi stops. On the right. So you know, he is a liver patient. All right? You can ask him questions about liver. He’ll be amazed that you know that he has a liver trouble. It stops at right heart. You just ask him a question about right heart. You just tell him these things, then I’ll tell you about this.

(40:57) Like, I tell you Douglas. Douglas is not such an intellectual, [...]. And they [...], you see. Just see My photograph, they do contortions (Shri Mataji whirl Her hands) and he telephoned in the ashram and Douglas received it. He said: ‘Who are you?’ He said: ‘I’m Douglas, I’m a Sahaja Yogi.’ ‘Really, what this Sahaja Yoga is?’ He said: ‘By the way are you perspiring too much?’ He said: ‘Yes I’m boiling (while) talking to you.’ He said: ‘That’s it. Have you been to TM?’ He said: ‘Yes, how do you know?’ ‘I know, because your chakras are catching.’ He said: ‘Surprising, these people can tell you.’ These don’t be [...] and you start open the book, I think he took My name or I think, or he took the name of the Goddess or whatever it is. And he just went in this contortions again. He said: ‘What have you started?’ Actually he got frightened [,,,] phoned to Me: ‘Mother, [...]

So, your powers are divine powers. Never forget that. On arguments, then once you have given them realization then start argument with them. But you can do it with your attention. You give them realization and then the arguments can given.

Because when I’m discussing with them actually I’m raising their Kundalini. Outwardly I’m discussing you see, everybody think Mother is talking, this, that [...] sometimes - but I’m really raising their Kundalini inside. So, first of all try to raise their Kundalini, because that works. Now, you know for definite what is the difference between the real and the unreal. That unreal is that a myth, – that: ‘This is a snake’ – it’s a myth. But when the light comes in you know it is not. The light has come to you. Even small children as they said, they know. You have got your own powers, no doubt about it. You can raise your Kundalini, no doubt about it. You can raise others Kundalini, no doubt. You can cure people, no doubt. For that if I have to give an example I have even cured the president of India. (43:39)

Now even that may not such a [...]. Then coming to the mental side of it, how you have achieved you know, you have given up all habits, then you have become a better person. While people who belong to other cult the don’t have give up any habits. On the contrary they become just slaves. Just slaves, they are not [...] as he said they are not [...] They become all slaves together and behave - collectivity to them is just slavery. Apart from that your knowledge is tremendous. You know why you do puja, you know why you make mantras, you know what mantras to say, when to say how to raise it and the whole science you do. Even their gurus never do the science that you do. All the technique Nirmala Vidya [...].

So, all the points that they have said, you have your own powers. You can ask them: ‘Can you feel me?’ ‘Yes, yes, we are feeling very hot.’ That’s all. But you should say: ‘I’m feeling you. You have been to such and such guru.’ Then your power to give him realization. Also later on can be told and show how to give realization. You should say: ‘Now you try to give me realization.’ You say: ‘All right, you give me realization.’ It‘s like [...] All right I will give you. ‘Will you allow me?’ Supposing he accept this. Finished! Then he is finished now. Once he is realized then he want talk. So you have to be very understanding of the situation. That first of all you are a realized soul, you have your own powers, the whole divine is behind you. [...] With all confidence just face the person. First going to meditative mood, [...] up your powers. And see that you raise his Kundalini, bring him to some point of report. Then this points one by one as this maybe they have suggested all right (?). But before raising them, discussion will lead to discussion. And it’s a headache [...]. I just do it because I don’t get a headache. You people don’t do it. I’m nothing to with the people who cannot be brought to a certain level of understanding. And they themselves will be impressed by your personality, by your methods. In your quiet way you should say: ‘Ha, this is..., ha!’ – like that, go on say: ‘Yes, yes.’ So he think, that he is impressing you, also you are listening to him [...]. That also pleases them [...]

Then now: ‘Thoroughly let me see where is your Kundlaini. Let me see. See around him. All right, now say what you have to say. Again say: ‘I’m not to [...]’. And at the back, raise it. Because if you cannot take out some [...] you have to pur your finger in around [...] way to take it out. [...] Kundlaini doesn’t won’t rise, we have nothing to do with such horrible people. So first of all you must judge the other person, raise his Kundalini, work it out and then once he has got it, then [...] All right [...]? You know the technique. So everyone whatever they have said, [...] and first class as we have said it. Warren is very [...] and all this points must be brought in but when we have brought them to a certain level established. Otherwise they just wobbling their heads or they will be deny you. Its total useless. But definitely you know your knowledge.

Now, second question. (48:31)

(39:59)
 So, when such a question comes in you just get into your meditative mood and you’ll be amazed the dynamism of the spirit will [...] in at that [...]. Now when it stops at Nabhi. Supposing the question at Nabhi stops, on the right. So, you know here is a liver patient. All right? You can ask him questions about liver. He’ll be amazed that you know that he has a liver trouble. It stops at right heart. You just ask him a question about right heart. You just tell him these things then I’ll tell you about this.

(45:28) ‚Will you allow me?’ Supposing he accepts this. Finish! Then he is finished now. Once he is realized then he won’t talk. So you have to be very understanding of the situation. That first of all, you are a realized Soul, you have your own powers and the whole divine is behind you. Don’t forget. With all confidence just face the person. First going to meditative mood, [...] up to your powers. And see that you raise his Kundalini, bring him to some point of report. Then this points one by one as this maybe which they have suggested are all right. But before raising them ... [sounds like ‘espacion’] we need to discussion. And it’s a headache [...]. I just do it because [...] a headache. You do may not do. I have nothing to do with people which cannot be brought to a certain level of understanding. And they themselves will be impressed by your personality by your [...]. In your quiet way you should say: ‘Ha! This is. Ha’. Like that. Go on say ‚yes, yes’. So he think that he is impressing you, also you are listening [?]. That was ... [?]. Then now: ‚Let me see where is his Kundalini? Let me see.’ See you around him. ‘All right, all right’, now say what you have to say. I’m not to ... [?] and at the back raise it. Because if you cannot take out some ... [incomprehensible – background noise] you have to take your finger in a round ... [?] way to take it out.
