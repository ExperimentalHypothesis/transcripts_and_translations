b"\nSeminar, Dedication Through Meditation, Morning\n\n(Transcript starts from 23:45)\n\nQuestion: What to say to somebody who comes up and says very concernedly: \xe2\x80\x98what is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and these\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x99\n\nShri Mataji: What\xe2\x80\x99s it?\n\nMan: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between what You are doing and what these cults or these other gurus are doing? The all seem saying the same thing\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\nShri Mataji: \xe2\x80\x9aThey are using the same language\xe2\x80\xa6 Ah, you see, because in 1970 I was in America, they have picked up everything. And a gentleman told Me, warned Me. He told Me: \xe2\x80\x9aMother, You better get all your tapes \xe2\x80\x93 what you call them? \xe2\x80\x93 copyrights, you see. I said: \xe2\x80\x9aWhy?\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x9aNo, this audio words vibrations this, that, will used by these people, chakras and all\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 I said: \xe2\x80\x9aVery good!\xe2\x80\x99 But ultimately they have to come for realization. But they are using the same\xe2\x80\xa6 - doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Now, tell him. What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between the technique of Sahaja Yoga and the technique of these people? They use the same words.\n\nShri Mataji requests the Yogis and Yoginis to answer to the question.\n\n(24:50) Answer of the Yogis and Yoginis.\n\n(35:30) Shri Mataji: You see, always the artificial has to copy the real. It is always so. Artificial has to copy the real, otherwise you can't sell. Of course outwardly in the gross we can say that artificial can sell, the real is spontaneous. Or artificial can put up a show, the real does not. The artificial is more earnest because it has to sell while the real is disbothered [? word ambiguous] as he said about Me. It\xe2\x80\x99s correct. But beyond that, how to make out an artificial from the real is the problem, because they have the same style of thing and these people say that we are doing the same thing, we are having vibrations, we have energy, we are raising the Kundalini, everything we do. Now the best thing would be to be extremely practical with this people. First of all you must judge whether they are seekers or not. Then you should see what chakras are catching. See, you move on another line. They move on another line because you are empowered. So you just see what chakras are catching on them.\n\nIf you answer them directly, they will come out with another answer. So, when they say something to you, you must know that if they are bhoots and they are possessed then they know your bhoots also, not only that, but they are read your mind, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the powers of bhoot. Because they can live on mental level, they can live on physical level, they can live on other levels like they have seen whatever past you have had they can tell you. They can [\xe2\x80\xa6] that. They can [\xe2\x80\xa6].They can tell you about your future, they can tell about past, they can tell about your mental problems, your brother, father. They can even tell you where you have lost your properties or where you have kept your ornaments and who is the ring. All these things they can tell. Because their interest is material, so they know everything about it and they can tell you.\n\nNow you have facing a person like that. So he reads your mind, all right. So, when he \xe2\x80\x93 you confront such a person, to deal with a person is to just kept quiet. Get into your thoughtless awareness. Be quiet. Your fortress is your thoughtless awareness because your are read (?). And try to see his Kundalini. Try to raise it and see where it stops. Now, he says: \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98See, I\xe2\x80\x99m, still let me hear, let me hear\xe2\x80\x99 All right? So show all the patience. Try to raise his Kundalini. Now if the Kundalini \xe2\x80\x93 see it is absolutely useless, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rise you can say: \xe2\x80\x98All right, I give up. Finish!\xe2\x80\x99 Nothing would happen. Our real nature as he said he loose (?). There is a word for the Goddess is \xe2\x80\x98Nirmama\xe2\x80\x99. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get attached to anyone. She cannot. If She is the energy for the whole universe, how can She get attached to anyone to any person at all? Only She can nourish and the nourishment can only go to a person who is willing to take a nourishment. You are on the giving stage, you are not on the thinking stage. If the other person doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have it you can\xe2\x80\x99t open the mouth and pour it in. So when such a question comes in you just go into your meditating mood and you will be amazed that the dynamism of the spirit will [\xe2\x80\xa6] there at that time. Now, maybe it stops at nabhi. Supposing the question at nabhi stops. On the right. So you know, he is a liver patient. All right? You can ask him questions about liver. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed that you know that he has a liver trouble. It stops at right heart. You just ask him a question about right heart. You just tell him these things, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about this.\n\n(40:57) Like, I tell you Douglas. Douglas is not such an intellectual, [\xe2\x80\xa6]. And they [\xe2\x80\xa6], you see. Just see My photograph, they do contortions (Shri Mataji whirl Her hands) and he telephoned in the ashram and Douglas received it. He said: \xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m Douglas, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Sahaja Yogi.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Really, what this Sahaja Yoga is?\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98By the way are you perspiring too much?\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98Yes I\xe2\x80\x99m boiling (while) talking to you.\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Have you been to TM?\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, how do you know?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I know, because your chakras are catching.\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98Surprising, these people can tell you.\xe2\x80\x99 These don\xe2\x80\x99t be [\xe2\x80\xa6] and you start open the book, I think he took My name or I think, or he took the name of the Goddess or whatever it is. And he just went in this contortions again. He said: \xe2\x80\x98What have you started?\xe2\x80\x99 Actually he got frightened [,,,] phoned to Me: \xe2\x80\x98Mother, [\xe2\x80\xa6]\n\nSo, your powers are divine powers. Never forget that. On arguments, then once you have given them realization then start argument with them. But you can do it with your attention. You give them realization and then the arguments can given.\n\nBecause when I\xe2\x80\x99m discussing with them actually I\xe2\x80\x99m raising their Kundalini. Outwardly I\xe2\x80\x99m discussing you see, everybody think Mother is talking, this, that [\xe2\x80\xa6] sometimes - but I\xe2\x80\x99m really raising their Kundalini inside. So, first of all try to raise their Kundalini, because that works. Now, you know for definite what is the difference between the real and the unreal. That unreal is that a myth, \xe2\x80\x93 that: \xe2\x80\x98This is a snake\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a myth. But when the light comes in you know it is not. The light has come to you. Even small children as they said, they know. You have got your own powers, no doubt about it. You can raise your Kundalini, no doubt about it. You can raise others Kundalini, no doubt. You can cure people, no doubt. For that if I have to give an example I have even cured the president of India. (43:39)\n\nNow even that may not such a [\xe2\x80\xa6]. Then coming to the mental side of it, how you have achieved you know, you have given up all habits, then you have become a better person. While people who belong to other cult the don\xe2\x80\x99t have give up any habits. On the contrary they become just slaves. Just slaves, they are not [\xe2\x80\xa6] as he said they are not [\xe2\x80\xa6] They become all slaves together and behave - collectivity to them is just slavery. Apart from that your knowledge is tremendous. You know why you do puja, you know why you make mantras, you know what mantras to say, when to say how to raise it and the whole science you do. Even their gurus never do the science that you do. All the technique Nirmala Vidya [\xe2\x80\xa6].\n\nSo, all the points that they have said, you have your own powers. You can ask them: \xe2\x80\x98Can you feel me?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, we are feeling very hot.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s all. But you should say: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling you. You have been to such and such guru.\xe2\x80\x99 Then your power to give him realization. Also later on can be told and show how to give realization. You should say: \xe2\x80\x98Now you try to give me realization.\xe2\x80\x99 You say: \xe2\x80\x98All right, you give me realization.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x98s like [\xe2\x80\xa6] All right I will give you. \xe2\x80\x98Will you allow me?\xe2\x80\x99 Supposing he accept this. Finished! Then he is finished now. Once he is realized then he want talk. So you have to be very understanding of the situation. That first of all you are a realized soul, you have your own powers, the whole divine is behind you. [\xe2\x80\xa6] With all confidence just face the person. First going to meditative mood, [\xe2\x80\xa6] up your powers. And see that you raise his Kundalini, bring him to some point of report. Then this points one by one as this maybe they have suggested all right (?). But before raising them, discussion will lead to discussion. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a headache [\xe2\x80\xa6]. I just do it because I don\xe2\x80\x99t get a headache. You people don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m nothing to with the people who cannot be brought to a certain level of understanding. And they themselves will be impressed by your personality, by your methods. In your quiet way you should say: \xe2\x80\x98Ha, this is\xe2\x80\xa6, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 like that, go on say: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes.\xe2\x80\x99 So he think, that he is impressing you, also you are listening to him [\xe2\x80\xa6]. That also pleases them [\xe2\x80\xa6]\n\nThen now: \xe2\x80\x98Thoroughly let me see where is your Kundlaini. Let me see. See around him. All right, now say what you have to say. Again say: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not to [\xe2\x80\xa6]\xe2\x80\x99. And at the back, raise it. Because if you cannot take out some [\xe2\x80\xa6] you have to pur your finger in around [\xe2\x80\xa6] way to take it out. [\xe2\x80\xa6] Kundlaini doesn\xe2\x80\x99t won\xe2\x80\x99t rise, we have nothing to do with such horrible people. So first of all you must judge the other person, raise his Kundalini, work it out and then once he has got it, then [\xe2\x80\xa6] All right [\xe2\x80\xa6]? You know the technique. So everyone whatever they have said, [\xe2\x80\xa6] and first class as we have said it. Warren is very [\xe2\x80\xa6] and all this points must be brought in but when we have brought them to a certain level established. Otherwise they just wobbling their heads or they will be deny you. Its total useless. But definitely you know your knowledge.\n\nNow, second question. (48:31)\n\n(39:59)\n So, when such a question comes in you just get into your meditative mood and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed the dynamism of the spirit will [\xe2\x80\xa6] in at that [\xe2\x80\xa6]. Now when it stops at Nabhi. Supposing the question at Nabhi stops, on the right. So, you know here is a liver patient. All right? You can ask him questions about liver. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed that you know that he has a liver trouble. It stops at right heart. You just ask him a question about right heart. You just tell him these things then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about this.\n\n(45:28) \xe2\x80\x9aWill you allow me?\xe2\x80\x99 Supposing he accepts this. Finish! Then he is finished now. Once he is realized then he won\xe2\x80\x99t talk. So you have to be very understanding of the situation. That first of all, you are a realized Soul, you have your own powers and the whole divine is behind you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget. With all confidence just face the person. First going to meditative mood, [\xe2\x80\xa6] up to your powers. And see that you raise his Kundalini, bring him to some point of report. Then this points one by one as this maybe which they have suggested are all right. But before raising them \xe2\x80\xa6 [sounds like \xe2\x80\x98espacion\xe2\x80\x99] we need to discussion. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a headache [\xe2\x80\xa6]. I just do it because [\xe2\x80\xa6] a headache. You do may not do. I have nothing to do with people which cannot be brought to a certain level of understanding. And they themselves will be impressed by your personality by your [\xe2\x80\xa6]. In your quiet way you should say: \xe2\x80\x98Ha! This is. Ha\xe2\x80\x99. Like that.  Go on say \xe2\x80\x9ayes, yes\xe2\x80\x99. So he think that he is impressing you, also you are listening [?]. That was \xe2\x80\xa6 [?]. Then now: \xe2\x80\x9aLet me see where is his Kundalini? Let me see.\xe2\x80\x99 See you around him. \xe2\x80\x98All right, all right\xe2\x80\x99, now say what you have to say. I\xe2\x80\x99m not to \xe2\x80\xa6 [?] and at the back raise it. Because if you cannot take out some \xe2\x80\xa6 [incomprehensible \xe2\x80\x93 background noise] you have to take your finger in a round \xe2\x80\xa6 [?] way to take it out.\n"
