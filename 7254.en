Public Program. Northampton (UK), 8 October 1982.

Shri Mataji: It’s quite.
Sahaja Yogi: Still quite, some more people are coming. Few people are still coming. 
So, with Mataji’s permission, I will just say a few more words while people are still coming into the hall so that when She speaks that can be full attention. Because this is a subject where we have to really give our attention fully and not be distracted by what's going on in the next seat or behind us.
What has to happen is that our attention should go inside. It's not an easy thing for people who are used to thinking, to stop thinking, and just watch what's going on. 
Because we are so identified with our thoughts, we don't realize that they're not reality and they're actually preventing us from experiencing reality which is absolutely the present time. 

So, please realize that if you have come here to get something, it’s something personal to you by which your relationship to others is very much purified and improved but which is for you and it's for them also, but you don't worry about them. 
Now one thing which will help this experience to take place, this happening to work out, is if you don't mind to take out take off your shoes and just rest your stocking feet on the floor. It's a very simple reason for doing this it's like an earthing system. It's just giving a contact with the Mother Earth. 
It's not a meaningless thing that the Muslims insist that we do this when we go to their mosques because Mohammed was a genuine teacher who was connected to this All-pervading source and who tried to teach people the actions that would help them to be balanced and to reach this higher state. But people follow it without understanding why they're doing it. 
So it's simply to provide an earthing an outlet if you like for negativity to pass out because we have to become the Spirit. We are the Spirit but we have to have that knowledge. And by letting all our thoughts all up but Karma's all our emotional hang-ups farce out through the different elements like the earth, the flame of the candle, into the sky, then we find the Spirit is what remains. It’s absolutely silent, it’s absolutely untarnished it cannot be killed as Christ proved. It cannot be harmed by anything; it's born again and again. And we have to know the joy of the Spirit which is just to be the Silent Witness of all the activity that goes on in our lives. 
So now I'd like to introduce the Divine Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: No, I’ll stand.

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset I must thank our very respected mayor of North Hank Hampton to grant us permission to use this beautiful Hall for this work of God.

Yesterday, at Bedford, I explained to you about this energy which is placed in the sacrum bone which in Sanskrit language is called as Kundalini. This energy is placed in the "sacrum" bone which is the Greek word; that means Greek people also knew that there is something sacred in this bone. Now this energy is the energy of desire within us, the primordial desire, the ultimate desire that is not yet manifested. That is the reason it is called as residual. This desire is to become one with the Divine.

We are born today in these modern times in a very great time I should say because this is the Blossom time of human beings. Never before in the history of spirituality, so many seekers were born, so many honest sincere seekers of Spirit were born. There are a special category of people they don't know why they are not satisfied with what they have, perhaps they don't know even what they have to seek but definitely they know that they have to seek something new.

We have our scriptures all over the world and to understand as I said the personality of any incarnation like Christ, we have to consult every scripture to see where it is indicated about the life of these incarnations.
This knowledge of the beyond, knowledge about the roots of the Tree of Life was a secret knowledge before, was very limited, was given to very few people. It’s described that at the time of Rama, his father-in-law Nanaka, who was the incarnation of the Primordial master, had
only one disciple who came to ask for Self-realization. And he said: "You can ask for my kingdom” because he was a king, "but don't ask for this". Because that was the beginning of life. But as in the story of a tree, there are only one or two flowers in the beginning a time comes when there's a Blossom time and many flowers blossom and the wind comes which sends the
message and they become the fruits. That's what is the time today is the time of Resurrection as described in Quran, as time of judgment as described in the Bible. This is described by a great astrologer in India, who was born thousands of years back whose books were revised about 300 years back. He has described this time again. 

When we think of the Resurrection time or the time of judgment, we must understand that this judgment has to come to us spontaneously from a living force. Because God is a living being and his force is living. All the living things you see that exist - for example, a flower becomes a fruit. All such tremendous things, we see we take it for granted, are the blessings of this living force which is all-pervading but it is subtle which we cannot feel. That's what Christ has said that, "you are to be born again" that's a very important thing. Actually, he came on this earth with this message. He didn't come to establish any balance within us because that was done by Moses and Abraham and all these people. But he actually came on this earth for us to ascend. This is the greatest message and Resurrection is his message and not crucifixion. Crucifixion has a very great
meaning no doubt and about which I'll tell you later as I'll go from chakras to chakras. 

When he said about the Holy Ghost he could not explain either. The reason being there was no time. There were only four years for him to speak about all these things and that's how he could not explain what was the Holy Ghost. So, for every practical purpose, it's a mystery. But after Realization, you will be amazed, it's not a mystery. You know everything about the domain of God, his laws and methods. Once you get your Realization, it's a surprising thing. But it is surprising because we do not know what we are. We do not know the Tree of Life is within us and that this divine power appears as the centres as described in the Bible: tongues of flames, I will appear before you like tongues of flames. And you really see them as tongues of flames. These centres are silent tongues of flames burning with different colours. Of course, especially at the top, they have many colours and all these colours are beautifully displayed and really peace giving.

But all this, what I am saying to you, is not to be taken for granted either and not to have faith in Me blindly. That's not the way to approach Sahaja Yoga. Because I'm talking of reality and not of some brainwashing. It's the reality that you must get and you have to be honest about it that you have to get the reality.
Now, when I say that all these things are within us, I am saying it like a hypothesis in a scientific research. And once it is proved to be true then you have to believe in it. So, as a research
student or as a person who is trying to know the new knowledge about the roots, you have to keep yourself open and a little tolerant about it. As Mr. Brown has told you that we have many angsts and that's why the problem is that's why we are confused. But this Kundalini is such a force that it shoots off taking you away from all those angsts and makes the Spirit shine in your attention in your central nervous system. 
Now the Spirit is a reflection of God Almighty within you. That's the collective being because God is a collective being it is a collective being. It is not that I say you are all brothers or sisters that's not the way so brainwashing, but it exists within us as an actuality. And when you actualize the Spirit you become collectively conscious. You become, that means on your fingers as you see, you start feeling other people. Then there is nobody the other you can feel yourself your centres and you can find out what's wrong with you what's wrong with others. 

Today, when I met the radio gentlemen, they suggested that people would be very anxious to
know how people get cured by Sahaja Yoga. So, first I would like to explain to you what happens. This force the residual force within you is the Kundalini as I told you and is the power that, when rises, she pierces through all these centres. And all these centres represent our physical being our emotional being our mental being and our spiritual being.
For example, the very first one that you see here, the red one, is our innocence. Innocence as human beings. As animals we had innocence. Then God created human beings and he gave them freedom. He said: "All right, you’ll be on your own keep your innocence. Don't run towards the so-called knowledge, the knowledge: "What is this matter? What is that? Who is God? All those things. Keep innocent”. If he had maintained that innocence with our freedom intact there would have no problem at all. 

But in the curiosity of human beings when they had the freedom, they consulted a satanic force. And the so-called book of knowledge started opening out. So, whatever we have got the knowledge is a "avidya " is not knowledge, it is non-knowledge. Because by knowing this you do not know the way about it. For example, if you know that is gravity in the matter or you can say there is gravity in the mother earth, you just know there is gravity. It's just a statement of fact which you see with your eyes but you can’t say why, why there is gravity. Whatever you learnt through science is just the knowledge that you see but you cannot explain why it is there. So, it is not a complete knowledge it is just a gross knowledge of the thing that you have which you can use for your purpose.

Also, science can help. Now, I find science is very helpful because if there was not a microphone, I could not have talked to you people. If there was no television people could not have received
vibrations those who received on the television today. It should not have impossible. So, even the science has helped you. But that knowledge was not required and it was all right.
But when we chose the other way, God also helped us by sending on this earth many incarnations to first tell us that: "You’d better establish your balance". And this balancing was done at this point [the Void] where you see the green circle which is here in the stomach. So, this balance has to be established. 
When we got the Ten Commandments, you see, we thought it's a challenge to our ego: who are they to say: "Thou shalt not do this ". What's wrong? Everybody says "what's wrong?" when they preach people don't like it because those please do not follow it, you see? Naturally people say: "What’s this?" But when the Kundalini awakens, she enlightens these Ten Commandments so we can say the religion within you. That's called as the principle of the Master within you. The master – say, in the car the one who is the master is watching the driver who's driving. First, learning how to drive, then suddenly he finds a driver has become an expert. And then he becomes a master. 

In the same way, when you start moving towards the right-side of action and the left-side of desire you act. Balance it: you make errors, mistakes you correct them, again you balance it. You discover the mistakes you have made, again you balance it. But these Ten Commandments, when they are enlightened within you, you just don't do those things, you don't like it, you just don't like, you just give up because there's enlightenment. For example, in this hall there is no light then you may fumble down when they fall down you may learn by following ten times that there are so many steps. But if there is light you can see everything. You can see the absolute relationship between everything. So, when you discover your absolute, the relative position of everything is understood and automatically you become righteous. Nobody has to tell you: "Become righteous ". You just become you can't help it. 
So, this is what it is we the diseases are caused mostly by imbalances. As Mr Brown has told you that the Mother Earth sucks the problems because all these centres are made out of the elements, different elements at different levels. And we have imbalances of these elements in our body and that's how we get sick. So, now the Mother Earth gives us, if she's here, if she knows Me, she'll suck your problems which are come by the imbalance of the mother earth. 

For example, arthritis and things like that, all these come as problems of Mother Earth. Especially in the cold countries people have this trouble they can be cured by taking help of the Mother Earth. It’s very surprising. The other day I had an Indian lady at my house. She has terrible arthritis, and her hands were like this and she couldn't walk. But when she understood how to ask the Mother Earth to take away her problems and the methods of divine laws, within half an hour she got rid of her arthritis. Even yesterday there was one gentleman who got better, much better which his arthritis. In the same way, we have problems with the imbalances within us.

Now, let us see what problems do we have with imbalances. I am sorry, today I am going to speak on more about our physical side because specially he said people will be interested and I think if you are physically not all right, how can you be all right spiritually? Now the imbalances we have within us, because we are extremists. If you are a person who is emotional you go to the end of your emotions till you become mad and lunatic. You weep out yourself so much that you have to land up in some lunatic asylum. But nature has its own way of controlling that. For example, a person who is a lunatic never, never has the failure of the brain. It should be but the failure- on the contrary the failure of the brain it has, but not the failure of the heart, though an emotional person works with the heart. 

On the contrary the one who works too much with the brain, thinks of the future, plans too much, his brain should fail but his heart fails. All heart failures come to people who think of the future, plan too much, think all the time, all the time worried about the future, work very hard physically because the right side is the physical and the mental side. They have all heart problems. And those who are very emotional, I mean, you say heart too much, always crying, weeping, they get failure of the brain. Just imagine, what a balance is build! And a doctor told Me, from a mental hospital, that they have a cardiograph machine, but it was never used because a lunatic’s heart never fails. So, once you have such an imbalance nature takes the respite but it can be very fatal and dangerous. There are many diseases which are caused, really, most of the diseases are caused by imbalances. Now let us take out a person who is a very speedy person, it's very common these days. I mean people are so speedy that you don't know how to talk to them. They are telescopically speedy their words go telescopically and you don't know how to scan it out, how to talk to them. Now such people who are speedy, who are running all the time, who are not there in the present at all, all the time of the future are the people who move too much on the right hand-side. And there is the second centre which is looking after the right-side, the creativity, the thinking. Because when you think the cells of the brain are replaced every minute by the fat that is in your stomach, by this centre which we call as Swadishthana which in the gross expresses itself as aortic plexus.

Of course, the medical science won't accept it but when we have proved it by curing people I hope they will accept it. Now this imbalance comes in because you are all the time thinking. Now this poor centre has to look after other organs within us like the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, intestines and uterus. Now such a person who is thinking all the time neglects all these organs and any one of these diseases he can have. For example, he can have liver [problems] he can have diabetes, he can have leukaemia. Leukaemia cost more to these speedy people not so much to the people who are futuristic, but more to the people who are speedy. Because the spleen acts for our emergencies. Supposing a person is extremely speedy; he just rushes to the bathroom, takes his bath goes and gets his breakfast and drives on the way eating his breakfast all the time. Poor spleen does know how to cope with this crazy personality. Because here it is, he’s going in a mad rush. In the modern times, you see the traffic is so bad, they just, they are shouting at the traffic. Then there's a breakfast going on. All these things are going simultaneously and poor, this spleen, doesn't know how to react and how to cope all the time to these emergencies, one after another, simultaneously so many coming up.

So, it gets crazy it loses its control completely and it starts producing additional blood cells and blood cells and blood cells. And when they become too much then they start flowing on their own, because there is no relationship left now because of the speediness. And that's how Leukaemia has established. Now leukaemia can be easily cured, very easily cured. Because when you put your hand when you are a Realized soul the energy is flowing. You just you put your hand on the spleen of the person, you'll be surprised that the spleen settles down because it gets new vitality. It gets the wisdom from these vibrations, we can say, from this energy because this energy is the one that thinks, that cooperates and organizes. That's the one which sorts out also all kinds of plants and everything. It is this living energy which when given to the spleen it becomes wiser: it rests, it becomes silent. And also, if you give the person the balance with your hand, you can make the person much more relaxed, much more silent within himself. And that is how you can cure. And we have, not only that, I have cured of course nowadays, I don’t cure people much.

There’s a disciple in America and one gentleman met Me in a village. He came in his car and he told me that: "My grandson has gone to America for his treatment of leukaemia and now they said he’s a gone case and in 15 days he is going to die. That's the certificate". So, I told him that: "I'm so busy in the villages now, you can go back and bring up this lady she's there in New York and she's an American Sahaja Yogini ". And he rang her. She said: "All right, I'll try to work it out ". And she cured him. The boy came to see Me in London he's now back in the school, he's perfectly all right. 

 Now people think it's magical. It is not! It's nothing so great. Because we take so many things for granted, every day, if you see the living work of God, it’s tremendous! Look at this honey, look at the way the flowers become fruits. I mean millions and billions of things we take it for granted even our evolution from amoeba to the stage we have come. We don't know how we have come, how God has done it. It's done so delicately with such care with such understanding. At least we should know that there must be some meaning when he has brought us to this level as a human being. What is the meaning? Why? What was the reason? Why he made us like this? And just when you discover this meaning spontaneously automatically this thing gets cured, because that vitality starts coming to you from the top. Now we grow over tensions why? Because you see, there, with the activity of these two sides left and right side, we develop two big balloons in our head. With the left-side one which is for conditioning us, which frightens us, gives us fear and all that, which is our past, we develop an institution call "superego". Such people are all the time under fear, under danger, or crying, weeping sort of people. The other side are the people who act. When they act, they have another by-product in the head called "ego" which you must have heard quite a lot. And this Mr ego is on one side and superego on another side and once they close down will become like an eggshell. You are closed. You have an "I-ness". You are Mr So, you are Mrs So. 

Now when this is accumulated there [Agnya] we feel the tension because either we are in action or we are in whipping conditions where we are in inaction. This tension mounts up in the head and you feel the tension. And with this tension you get all sort of complications. With the left-side you might get low blood pressure and all that. With the right-side you might get high blood pressure. Now how do you reduce the tension? People ask Me how do you reduce the tension? It's a very simple thing. You see, life’s work is extremely simple. Like your own breathing is so simple! Have you ever thought about the breathing that you do? You don't read any books you don't go anywhere you don't consult anyone it just happens to you. In the same way, it's such a simple thing that your tension on the head is because either you are worried or you are planning something. You are aggressive or you are taking the aggression; one of the two.

So, what happens? Here I say that Christ plays a very big role in our life because he is placed in that crossing point if you see. This is the cross. When he said on the cross: "It has been accomplished". When he says that the placing of Christ in that little space of ego and superego is accomplished. When Christ is awakened through the kindling of the Kundalini then these two things are sucked in. That’s why we say he died for our sins because the left-side are the sins and the right-side are the Karmas the action, the ego. So, he sucks it. By that suction you are amazed that suddenly you find there’s a depression here like a child has. And you feel the throbbing here. And after the throbbing you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. From your own head the cool breeze is coming out. This Holy Ghost is manifesting herself. And she's all around. Also, you can start feeling in your hands if your- this centre is all right.

This is what he meant "to be born again". Not just to call some people: "All right now we have a baptism". So, the poor child is screaming and you put your hand on his head and say: "All right, you're baptized now". That's artificial, it’s just a drama. And this kind of drama they do in every religion. It’s not only in Christianity. You'll find even Hindus do the same joke and everybody has the same joke. But it's not true because if there is baptism there has to be transformation. And there is no transformation whether you baptize a child or not. On the contrary, I have seen some children they become funny. Because this is a very precious place, it is a very holy place [Sahasrara] and anybody who is not a holy person who is not a sanctified person places the hand on top of the head of such any child, he can become even mad. 
We had three examples of that kind that people who got baptism, children who are perfectly normal but after baptism their eyes started squinting around and they lost their awareness. Because the people who put their hands on this very precious holy place where not themselves holy. They didn't have a clean heart. And that's why- this is the centre of the heart which is there in the Spirit. And this one [Sahasrara] when it is touched by someone who has a heart of a stone can pass bad vibrations satanic vibrations. People can spoil them. 

You have a very great poet in this country- you had him- was William Blake. And he said: "A priest cursed on my head". And people asked Me: "What it is?" I said: "The priest must be somebody who is not such a good man perhaps and he touched his forehead". Because he was a Realized soul. And he's written so much about Sahaja Yoga that nowhere in the world I have seen so much written about Sahaja Yoga as your great poet William Blake.

Now when this happens so many other things can also happen to us. For example, a person who is very emotional, for example, the one who is always whipping crying going to the left-side. Oh, they are - most of the people feel guilty that's the worst disease of the West. By feeling guilty you get spondylitis, thyroid all kinds of troubles. So, no use. What’s the use to feeling guilty after all? Or people who believe that "we must suffer". Now this I can't understand at all! Because Christ has suffered for us. What more are we going to suffer? Now he suffered already for us. Has he left something for us to suffer? Those people who believe like Jews did believe in such a thing, they suffered. We don't have to suffer at all! That's a promise. He suffered for us. Only thing, we have to awaken him, that's all. Nor do we have to feel we are very guilty because if you feel guilty then this left-side gets caught up [Left Vishuddhi]. And it creates a problem for your Realization first of all and secondly, it might give you a physical problem.

I've seen this is very common with the West people I don't know why they should feel guilty. One must know that God Almighty is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness. We cannot understand his forgiveness, we cannot be like him. And what guilt can we have? Even the judges on this earth who are just human beings cannot punish you. How can that God is going to punish you for what? So, we live with myths: "Oh, I should not have done it, I should not have done it". 
This has come also with our modern life. For example, if you put your fork and spoon in this way then you are all right, sophisticated. If you just put it a little this way: then you are: "Oh, I should not have done it". If you spill the coffee then you are as if you’d murdered three persons the way you feel about it. It is not so. It's not so. In the realm of God what does it matter? It's nothing important. For him, the most important thing is that you are a human being. And you must know that you are at the epitome of the whole creation and that should have no self-pity about it, no self-pity at all. But you must have self-confidence that God has created you with a purpose, that you become collectively conscious and you see the play of God’s beauty and his glory. That’s why he has created you. Not to feel guilty not to have self-pity and to cry and weep and always say: "I'm horrible. I have problems". Such people get troubles to themselves while those are aggressive trouble others. Both are just the same in the eyes of God whether you trouble yourself or others, it's just the same. 

Now this kind of an imbalance that comes within us can be corrected with the awakening of Christ within us. The chanting at this place when he is awakened, when he is awakened because you are to be connected with him. Then is our Lord’s prayer that's the mantra. We have to say that he is kept awakened and that is the chanting we have.

You’ll be amazed after coming to Sahaja Yoga the Christians who hated the Jews have understood the importance of Moses because he resides in this void part, this green circle and all ten of them who incarnated again and again reside there. Now those who are fanatics say, those who believe that only more Muhammad is the one or those who believe that only the Moses is the one or any such funny ideas, they also suffer physically. 

I had a doctor from Iran, about ten years back I should say, he came to England to see me and he had a cancer of the stomach. And I asked him, I said: "Do you believe that Muhammad is the only one you had?" "Yes. I believe in that." I said: "How can it be? He himself has said there have been many prophets. And how can you say that he's the only one?" So, he said: "No, no, no. He was the last. He was the most modern so I believe in him and I don't believe in anybody else". I said: "You have to believe in Moses. "Oh! That I cannot believe. These Jews, I can't believe in them. I hate the Jews I can't believe Moses." I said: "All right, go ahead, if you can't believe in him. Same is Nanaka. Same is Janaka. They are the same people again born again. And the same quality of the Primordial master is born again. I said: "All right, go ahead, I cannot cure you if you are a fanatic you suffer." So, he went home and he had a bad time. Doctor said: "You are going to die now".
So, after eight days his wife brought him again. I said: "Now do you believe in it?" he said: "Yes Mother, I do. Please, cure me". And he got cured. He's still alive all right. 

Fanaticism has its own respite to. Fanaticism is real madness I should say to be fanatical about something. It's a mental projection to believe that somebody belongs to you. Actually, you have to belong to them and nobody belongs to you. This fight of religion imagine when you see that in this world there are fights going on in the name of God, in the name of religion, you're shocked! The things that were created for peace, for bliss and for heavenly abode of human beings are being used for something that is absolutely opposite of that. It's most surprising how people are believing into a team to such an extent that they are just getting monopolized and filthen [unsure] and they are torturing others.

It could become even very sophisticated like people who have formed lots of mental projections you see, they have dogmas, this, that and they cultivate you every time they have a lecture and then you believe in it: "Oh, oui, [yes?] this is this". And from your childhood you are told, "you are like this you are like that". Ultimately, what do you find at the end of life? Nothing but the same and same and same going on. But the principle of religion is to give you a balance and that doesn't happen unless and until this religion is awakened within you.

Once it is awakened, I don't have to tell you that: "You give up your drugs". You just give up. I don't have to tell you: "Take your alcoholism out. " You just do it. I just don't tell you. I don't say that if you have alcoholism or anything as a disease it just drops up automatically. Even if you want you cannot drink. You won't enjoy it at all! It's just as a by-product as you get rid of your troubles. In the same way, these habits also drop out. You become independent you become free not slave of anything because you are the Spirit which is the freedom within you. Complete supreme freedom is your Spirit.

Last of all, I will tell you about a horrible disease, which is the modern disease nowadays, is the disease of cancer, which is a horrible thing as people say. Cancer is caused mostly, which I have seen, in the people who are left-sided. Not so much in the right-sided people, those who are aggressive. But those who are emotionally ones disturbed get this trouble. So far, I have not seen one patient of cancer who has not been emotionally very much inclined. It might look, appear that a person is very aggressive, but if you really go into the history of a person you will find that he had a problem, that his mother died, or his father died early, or some sort of an emotional problem he developed later on, or a shock from his wife or a fiancée, from his children or something like that. It’s more a case of emotional disturbance. 
Now when you find, that a person has a cancer, on the hands you’ll find that all these fingers are burning [Shri Mataji shows all the fingers of Her left hand], sometimes even these fingers start burning [Shri Mataji shows fingers of Her right hand]. When it is on a galloping state you put your hands towards a person who is suffering from cancer- even doctors might not diagnose it, they might find it later on – all your fingers start burning. You start burning here and here [Shri Mataji points on the top of the palm near the fingers]. Also, you may start feeling a throbbing here [Shri Mataji points to the solar plexus]. Of course, throbbing doesn’t mean that a person has a cancer, but is one of the symptoms. 

Now how cancer is caused? It’s very simple. And to understand it- it’s better that if you understand- you will not those things which are not to be done. Anything we do into extremes, I mean any emergency is taking over by this two sides, because they manifest the sympathetic nervous system. They act for our sympathetic nervous system whenever there is an emergency. For example, a person has a habit, a simple habit, of say, rubbing his ears, very simple habit. He may develop a cancer there. Because he has overdone it. An extreme thing he has done is rubbing, rubbing, rubbing. 
So, what happens is that the cells which are supported by a centre here, for example, it’s coming from left and right [Shri Mataji forms a triangle to mime the spinal cord] – and that’s how a centre is formed. If you can see all of you. This is the one through which the medulla oblongata passes, the spinal cord, this is the spinal cord. Now, when there is a pull on right-side or left-side too much, on the sympathetic nervous system, then this connection breaks out like that [Shri Mataji splits the hands]. When it breaks out the connection of the centre with the whole, because this centre [right thumb] is supplying the energy, is broken. 
When the connection with the whole is broken, there is no coordination left, there is no control left. So, the cells become on their own what we call malignant. They start growing on their own. For example, if their nose develops the cancer, than nose becomes big. The rest of the- is smaller and the cells of the nose start pressing all other organs in here [on the throat]. And sometimes they may pass into blood and go to other areas also. So, these are aggressive cells, malignant cells are on their own, you cannot control them. 

By some chance, if you could bring them back in connection with the whole, if you can do that, cancer can be cured. It’s as simple as that. When the Kundalini rises, what she does is, she awakens the centre. And when the centre is awakened, it just comes back to normal and a person becomes normal. That’s how cancer can be cured. It is very simple, it’s not so difficult. Human life we have made it so difficult, actually it’s not so difficult. It’s a very simple thing if you understand the laws of nature and laws of God’s divine Power. You can overcome most of your maladies, most of your problems and you’ll reside in the kingdom of God.

Now, there are so many other diseases which I don’t want to refer now because I have tell to you the physical side. And the mental side is the left side as I told you. Also, on the left side is another disease, is multiple sclerosis. I saw a very good television show the other day. It was put up by some doctors. And they said that in ourselves there is an area which is built in from our creation, means the collective subconscious. That’s what we call it. And there are proteins which they call protein 58, protein 52 or something like that. They enter into our being and trigger the cancer. So that shows what we have said, that there are dead within us. On the left-hand side is the subconscious and then the collective subconscious. And when you enter into the collective subconscious, anyone of this spirits can catch hold of you. Once they catch hold of you, you are liable to any of these diseases. Specially I have seen if there is a possessed person – of course they become mad, they get epilepsy, all this are possessed people. Epilepsy can be cured; we have someone here who had epilepsy of the worse type. She is cured completely.

And all such mental troubles, depression, can be cured. Not difficult at all. But one must know, that if you are possessed you must really work it out and see to it, that it goes away from you and you become yourself. Because when you are the other, you don’t know what’s happening to you. Now this affliction when it comes to you, there is another horrible disease called multiple sclerosis which comes up. I have seen so far there three cases in England of multiple sclerosis which have been cured by Sahaja Yoga. All of them had either the wife or the husband possessed. Can you imagine? It’s something surprising. We do not know these things are so important. These are very important things and that’s why all these people come on this earth said, that you lead a clean life. And a sensible married life.’ It is not permitted to have an adulteress life in any religion whatsoever, because adulteress life brings forth all kinds of problems of the sex spoiling the last chakra. People can become impotent or overexcited, could become suffering from all the troubles of this centre, which you know are diseases which are kept as secrets.

So, one has to lead a very clean wonderful married life, because marriage is supported and sanctioned by the collective. It is sanctioned by God almighty. So, that kind of a life, that kind of a sexual life, is a sensible one. One should not get a shock out of it. When I say this in the west, people really don’t like it. But I’m your mother. I have to tell you the truth. Even whatever you have done is done – finished, doesn’t matter. But now come to your sanity. Because there are all these horrible satanic diseases waiting just to gulp you down. Apart from diseases such a person creates a problem for children. He creates a problem for the whole society. The whole society topples down. If they do not respect the marriage, if the woman becomes aggressive and try to sort of replace men – they cannot do it, they are woman. Men are man, woman are woman. But that doesn’t mean that somebody is going to suppress. They are equal, no doubt, but not similar. This is a simple point we don’t understand. They woman is to be respected, but she has to be respectable. And she has to be respected, because she is one who is the power behind the man.

If we understand all these simple things of life, the life becomes very beautiful. How we have to respect our elders. How we have to respect everyone. The respect itself is gone from the modern times. People have accepted themselves as something you see ‘what’s wrong’ business. There is no respect for anything whatsoever. I mean the way they bark at each other; one doesn’t understand how human beings have become now dogs or what have they become the way they start barking at each other. The whole system goes out of gear when we become too much materialistic also, because the matter makes us absolutely a dead matter also. But I’m not saying that you have to give up anything. What do you give up? You don’t give up anything because if you have not taken anything into you, if you do not cling anything to anything, what do you give up?

Like this people Hare Rama came to Me and they saw Me in My house and of course I mean, we live very well. Perhaps they thought it was too much for a saint like Me to life in all these luxuries. And they started saying: ‘Mother, You are living in this fashion and how people call You a saint. I said: All right. Now, you talk of Lord Krishna, isn’t it? Now in this house or one My body anywhere you find anything equal to the dust of the feed of Lord Krishna, you take it away. Anything, but must equal! ‘ That’s one thing. They looked around and they could find anything. I said: ‘What have you given up? Stones? Ashes? What is there to give up?‘ When you just see the whole thing as a drama, when you are not clinging on anything, what is there to give up? In Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in false asceticism at all. Be believe in the real asceticism which comes from within. Where a person gives. Where a person enjoys matter in giving others. We don’t believe in this kind of a falsehood that you wear a certain type of cloth or you have a nunnery or this judo-sannyasis going around. None of these things. You have to lead a very normal life in the centre.

All the great saints of India were married and had children. Except for some people like Buddha who died very early. He had to take a sannyasa because of His work. Then we had people like also we can say Kabira, Nanaka – all of them were married people. And nobody talked of this extreme nature that you have to give up everyone. Such people can be very, very dangerous. They can be very hot tempered. They can be so hot tempered that you cannot just face them. Because marriage makes you very normal to come in the centre. In this life, in this married life you are going to receive the blessings of God. There is no abnormity needed. Actually, we become extremely normal when you get your realization. Of course, some of these ideas may not appeal to you. But you can see for yourself, whatever I say is true or not? After Realization, you become a different person. Your priorities change, you become such a beautiful person because you start giving. The whole thing starts flowing from you. Because you become the light and the light starts flowing from you. And then you understand and assume your powers, powers of your Spirit and you enjoy this compassionate flow. And all the things look very different, the whole life changes.

This has to happen to the whole world if you bring peace and sanity, if you have to save this creation, we have to do this. Actually, the divine is more anxious than anybody else to do it because the creation will be lost if human beings are lost. So, those who are people who are seeking should understand their responsibility that they have to become the spirit. And after becoming the spirit they have to manifest the powers of their spirit. These are their own powers which they manifest. Only they have to know how to work it out. It’s very simple as I said. And to have it is the best way to understand it.

May God bless you all.

I would like to have some questions from new people because today is the first lecture here, but for a short time. Please ask constructive questions. Don’t ask offensive questions unnecessarily. I’m here to do good to you, not to do any harm to you whatsoever, take it from Me. So, be kind to Me and ask Me questions which are good for you and for everybody else, because they are all just waiting for their Realization which should not also spoil their chances and delay the matter. So, I would request you to ask Me questions which are sensible related to the subject and I’ll be very happy to answer them because certainly when you get your Realization you will find your mind will peep out: ‘Oh, you didn’t ask this question to mother.’ I’m sorry I have been speaking now every day and last month I was too [?]. Everyday there was a speech on, so little bit there is a strain on My throat, doesn’t matter.

Can I request you to ask Me questions please? Thank you.

Shri Mataji: Yes, please? Woman: Can you get rid of epilepsy? Shri Mataji: What is it? Sahaja Yogi: Can you get rid of epilepsy? Shri Mataji: You just come here to tell Me. Sahaja Yogi: The lady is asking can you get rid of epilepsy? Shri Mataji: Yes. All right. Yes. Woman: [Inaudible] Sahaja Yogi: What is it? I didn’t follow, can you raise your hand, please, where are you? Sahaja Yogi: The lady’s question was whether one can you get rid of epilepsy. Shri Mataji: Yes, we do, we can. If you really cooperate with us it will work out. It will work out definitely. But you have to cooperate. You see, I’m not a doctor which is one who takes money from you, so you are not bound to Me. It’s your freedom. It’s your freedom! Whether you want to cooperate or not, but sometimes people don’t cooperate, then I can’t help it. It’s noting great is to be done but few things that have to be followed if you cooperate with Me, of course it can be done without of course any charges, anything, it just works out. Yes. 

Woman: [wording incomprehensible] Shri Mataji: What’s she saying? Woman: Will You help me please? Shri Mataji: Definitely, why not? I’m here for that, all right. Make yourself comfortable, yes. Actually, I’m not helping anyone, I’m helping myself. Supposing this finger is paining and if I rub it, do I help anyone? Because you are within Me. When you start everyone – you’re feeling another person within yourself we really don’t help anyone. There is no question of charity. It’s question of my saving myself. All right? Woman: I’d like your help too, please. Shri Mataji: What is it? Woman: I’d like your help too. Shri Mataji: What did she say, Gavin? Gavin: She say’s also that she would like to have your help. Shri Mataji: All of you. All of you are going to be helped in a way if you say call it ‘help’, but I don’t like the word ‘help’ much. It’s your own. It’s your own. Just like if you go to a banker for example. Then you say: ‘Can I have my check cashed?’ All right? At the most you’ll say ‘can you help me?’, because you are very generous, I should say and sophisticated. But actually, it’s your bank there and it’s your money. You better have it.

Woman: Mother, can you [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Can you raise your hand I can’t see which one is speaking? Yes, my child.
Woman: Mother, ... [wording incomprehensible]
Shri Mataji: What she is saying?
Sahaja Yogi: What do You hope to achieve through Your lectures?
Shri Mataji: What do you do Myself?
Sahaja Yogi: What do You hope to achieve?
Shri Mataji: Achieve? I mean, don’t you understand. [laughing] What am I achieving is that you all have to become collectively conscious. That’s what I’m achieving, nothing else. As I am. I will tell you in political terminology, all right? I have all the powers within Myself, so I’m a capitalist. But I can’t enjoy it because I have to give you, so I’m a communist. And I want you to enjoy your own powers, that’s all. Nothing more than that.

Shri Mataji: Yes please? Man: Is it possible to receive help after a surgery or before. Shri Mataji: After? Sahaja Yogi: After surgery. Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, of course. There is no problem even after surgery. But if you put something artificial there – sort of a - say a rod or say, steel or something, then we can’t move it. It has to be something living. We can repair it, regenerate it and we can give vitality, but to the rod, say, it’s of steel, then what can we do? But other surgeries we can work out. Shri Mataji: Yes, please? Yes? Please ask the question? Man: [Inaudible] Shri Mataji: What? Sahaja Yogi: He also wants the help of Mother. Shri Mataji: All right, for all of you, I’m there. You don’t worry, you all are there. I’m going to come down and see all of you, all right? All of you I’m going to see like yesterday, as we did. 

Man: Mother. When You were speaking about Holy Ghost

Shri Mataji: Yes. Man: You use the word ‘She’ which regard to that. Shri Mataji: Shri? Man: She Shri Mataji: Yes Man: You said She. Shri Mataji: ‘She’, yes. ‘She’ is the power and She is called as Shakti. ‘Shakti’ – She is the power. So ‘He’ is the God Almighty and His power is the ‘She’ – the Holy Ghost. Man: The creator’s power? Shri Mataji: That’s the power of the divine power of God, His love. Which has got one: is a creative power. Another is the power of His desire. First you must have desire. Then he creates, so He has a power of desire and He has a power of creativity and also, He has a third power, which is the power which gives us sustenance. We become say – we have our qualities, like carbon has four valences and all that. And then it also gives us evolution. So, this third power is more important, because that gives us this ascent also. This is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost which is the power of God Almighty, which is the power of His divine love.

Woman: Mother, if some diseases are caused by our parents, why innocent children get leukaemia for example? Shri Mataji: Oh, they get it because the mother is like that. Mother must be a speedy lady. You see, if the mother – today only I had a lady, I must tell you: I saw a lady, she’s told Me that: " My child is overactive, she is so active that I don’t know how to control. It’s not a mental case, but it is a funny situation, that she is overactive ". So, I said: "What were you doing? " when she was pregnant. She was such, she told Me, in the night she used to work in the factory, the whole day she used to work in the house. Imagine? I mean, you pay no respect to your pregnancy. So, what will happen? If the mother is so, sort of a speedy person, the child gets it. You see, mother has such an influence on the child, isn’t it? The blood of the mother goes into the child. And that blood carries the message. That’s how the children get it. And that’s very difficult to cure also. One has to know also, when you are pregnant, how to treat your children, how to be looking after your foetus. That’s one has to know all these things. These are very important basic things which we do not know.

Shri Mataji: Yes? Man: Your power of healing, is it something that you sought yourself or were you born with it? Shri Mataji: What is it? Come and tell Me as I just can’t hear. Sahaja Yogi: He is asking, is your power of healing something You sought yourself or which was born with You? Shri Mataji [smiling]: It’s all with Me, all right? As you know you are a human being, I knew, I was this. But about Me I’d better not tell. It’s better you discover it. It’s better not to tell about oneself. You better discover it. Gradually, you will discover about Me.

Shri Mataji: Yes? Now, say loudly. Woman: Is it possible to go to classes in Northampton and .... how much is it? [Unsure] Sahaja Yogi: She wants to know if there are classes in Sahaja Yoga in Northampton. Shri Mataji: You cannot have a course in it, you see. It is not courses, but we have centres. You have to just go and know about it. There is no classes, nothing like that, but you can come to the centre, where they will tell you how to use this power, what does this mean, all the decoding of it, how to establish your Realization. We have a centre here in Northampton and I don’t know when you have it. I’ll tell- I don’t know. But we have a centre here, just right here. Can somebody tell when is the program, at what time? Sahaja Yogi: The program in Northampton [Inaudible conversation] Shri Mataji: You can become masters, real gurus. Yes, you can. But I think people must take it more seriously about the whole thing and should understand it and learn it, because the main thing is we do not take any money, you see. So, people think, that you see, you are not bound. You are absolutely free to come and to go. But this freedom sometimes makes a person a little superficial or sometimes a little frivolous about it. But this is so precious, so invaluable, that you cannot charge any money for this knowledge. All right? Now, should we have it? No questions?

Man: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Gavin, what did he say, I just can’t? Did you hear?

Gavin: No...

Shri Mataji: You didn’t hear him: Just stand up, I think. You better stand up here. Gavin, you just stand up. Just say it loudly, please, if you don’t mind. Yes!

Man: [Inaudible]

Gavin: When you have a pain within yourself [...] through the mother earth? [some words incomprehensible].

Shri Mataji: Yes, some things are sucked by mother earth, as I told you – some. Some are sucked by the flame of the... – can be the flame, can be the fire. The sun also sucks in. Then the sky also sucks in, anything can. It depends on, on what centre you have a problem. All these centres are separately made by different elements. It depends on, what problem you have. All right? But on the whole mother earth is the most precious thing. She helps the maximum on thing.

Man: You spoke about living energies and vibrations and the scientist with us [...] not the scientist he enjoys trying to get the rays within, he mentions the gravity [...]. Because there were people who thoroughly enjoy ... into the rays of gravity. I’ve been very ... in things like dowsing. [some words incomprehensible].

Shri Mataji: Ah, dowsing. Dowsing is...

Man: A force now ... bring ... together [unclear]

Shri Mataji: I talked about this yesterday. Yesterday I talked, but again if you want, I’ll tell you in short. You see, we have some other dimension which we are not know, they are unknown to us. But they are not divine, like we have the left side dimensions as I told you, you go into the collective subconscious. Now if you go into collective subconscious some of this busy bodies can enter into your being. And they are the once who give you this power of dowsing. You see, that’s how you start knowing there is water, because there are some spirits in you which can [? ] to it. You see, there are ESP’s and all this thing come from the same sources. There could be some on the right-hand side, supra-conscious once, which are very aggressive. Hitler used them. He is the one who used this supra-conscious people, very aggressive people and enticed all German people and made them so aggressive. So, these two areas are within us.

In Sanskrit the one on the left is called ‘adi bhautic’ and the right as ‘adi daivic’ [?]. Both of these are to be avoided. For example, somebody sees auras around Me, for example now. I would say he should not. It’s not proper. Because then you are on the right side. But if you see some gods and goddesses around Me, that also is not good, because you’re seeing the left side – the past, and the future. What you have to be is in the centre, in the present.

So, all these things come to you from some busy bodies as I said, that they enter into your being. I have seen another television show where they showed Gogin entering into somebody. And he was painting just like him. The lines were just like him, bold the same wave very different styles that he has. And he was doing it and he said: ‘I’m Gogin.’ And this is very common even with curatives. When people cured, they use spiritualists. That’s very dangerous. All these are taking you to the realm, which is not your own. It is somebody else who acts in you. Even a thing like, say acupuncture can be very dangerous, because acupuncture uses the whatever energy in you of the sympathetic. This is energy I’m talking which is all the time flowing. When you get connected with the mains all the time it is flowing within you. That’s the energy we should have. And the scientists are correct when they say vibrations. But they can’t say, why there are vibrations. This is the point. Not that I’m against science because today the science is helping us so much.

Man ask about his son, which have skin problems. [analogous]

Shri Mataji: Ah, skin problem. All right, there’s nothing, that’s liver.

Woman: How can I help myself...

Sahaja Yogi: How can she learn to cure herself.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what I’m saying that today if you get Realization well and good. Otherwise there is a centre, you can come, by which whatever you have cured yourself, but you can cure others also. [1:06:59]

Man: The Self-realization, Sahaja Yoga. Is that the answer about our problems? [... some words unclear]

Shri Mataji: Hundred percent, to all problems. You see, because we live in a relative world. We are living relatively and we are confused, isn’t it? But when you find the absolute, all the questions are solved. That’s true, because spirit is to be awakened, that’s the main thing. Spirit is the solution. Firstly, it is the collective being. Again, it is the source of all vitality. It is the source of all the creativity. It is the source of all the joy and bliss. Once you achieve that being within you, when that being shines in your attention, you become the master of that.

[1:08:03] Woman: Question incomprehensible.

Shri Mataji: Can you say it loudly?

Man: She says Mother, has the mother nature provided the answer in terms of herbs to cure people?

Shri Mataji: We don’t use any herbs or anything. We at the most can sanctify some water or salt or sugar, these basic things, that’s all. We don’t use any herbs or anything, that’s not needed now anymore.

Woman: Excuse me, do we have to be religious to... [some words incomprehensible]

Shri Mataji: You don’t have to be religious at all. But religious is different from religion! Religion is within you, you can’t get rid of it. You see, religion is your quality as a human being. That’s within you, you can’t get rid of it. If you go against it, whatever is within you, then there is a problem. Yes, everyone has that, everyone has that! That’s true and that’s why you get problems. But religious is a very absurd thing. Sometimes religious so called people can be horridly hot tempered, you know. Could be very bad and could be – I mean, it has no relationship whit reality sometimes. So religious is a different thing, but religion is important. Religion is universal, which is within you. Now, let’s start now.

Woman: Question about diet. [exact wording unclear]

Man: She says Mother, does the diet which we ... solve her problems?

Shri Mataji: Yes, not the diet want solve it completely, but when you take to Sahaja Yoga, supposing you are a liver-patient, all right. So, we give you some sanctified or vibrated sugar to eat, white sugar. Now doctors will say: "Don’t eat white sugar", but we have cured so many of liver troubles. All have migraines and this and that and so many troubles of the allergies are to be cured. Now for that of course we say, for about a month, you just don’t eat some fats. You see, that’s all right. But that by eating, you see, you paying so much attention ‘eat this, eat that! That food, that food!’ That’s not needed. It’s too much attention diverted to food. But you should know basics. But if this is the problem with you then what you should eat. That’s all, it’s not such a emphasis on diet that you eat this.

Only by dieting you maybe, all right, at the most physically, but you are not only a physical being. You are also an emotional being. If you pay too much attention to your physical side, you can become a dry personality. Absolutely. There could be divorces in the families and such a person who just is nothing but a physical, imagine. It can be very dangerous and can be a very, very angry person who has just physical thing. And such a person gets heart – heart trouble, because the spirit resides in your heart and if you are too much physical, then the heart goes out, because you must pay attention to your spirit. So, you are not only a physical being, you are a mental being, you are an emotional being and you are a spiritual being. All this must be integrated and there should be a complete balance.
