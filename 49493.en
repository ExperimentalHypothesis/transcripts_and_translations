So the Swadisthan chakra which is placed second now is the one which has got six petals and this is the one that controls the pelvic plexus the aoutic plexus within us that also has got six plexuses now we have to know that  these are subtle centres placed in our spinal cord and the growth centres are outside now this is something one must understand if you have to understand about kundalini that these centres are placed outside of growth plexuses which doctors know but they are actually subtle centres inside the spinal cord beyond that is another centre which you can see that call manipura chakra that told you the centre the navel chakra which has got 10 petals as i have told you that there are have been 10 gurus also and around that is the void is the gap now this gap has to be filled now what happens when you place your hands towards me like this if you could it would be nice all of you should place your hands it works out simultaneously, see this power, this divine power which is an integrated power which is all powers put together starts flowing into your being through your fingers, these fingers five fingers this portion and this portion as you can see from the chart you have to venue are responsible for subtle that divinity within yourself. It was like an anti it goes inside and fetch it filth your stomach by which an invitation is sent to this Kundalini, she's awareness she understands that she is facing the right person and when the invitation comes she starts rising, she starts rising upwards breaking through all these centers already some of you must be feeling cool breeze in the hand already, those who are not feeling also should keep their hands just like this very simple method is the simplest of all now you know that these are all sympathetic point, these are two sympathetic nervous system left and right, it starts working through you passes into your hand goes into your stomach and invites the Kundalini, the Kundalini first of all looks after your physical being, supposing you are sick in ego you can sick then the Kundalini try first to give you physical comfort, it goes to the point where the person has the problem supposing you have stomach trouble liver trouble you can see at the back of that person that at that point it is pulsating you can also see that the in the hand this finger this thumb is burning and if you ask a person are you suffering from hypotizes he will say how do you know? That's why it is a science , it is a science because whatever you see is there happens and you commeneover this power once you are realized so it treats your physical being I have said it off and on and again today i want to repeat it one thing that cancer is a disease which can only be cured through self realization there's no other way because overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system on both the sides create a situation where person becomes malignant means he's self start working on their own they will loose their contact with the whole , to give it a balance and harbony there is a system within us known as parasympathetic in the center which also is connected to all other deities and these are the organizers the deities which always give us a balance for example if you are walking fast your heart start beating fast for the emergency but gradually it comes back and that is brought back by the parasympathetic because of the parasympathetic activity in you, you are what you are otherwise it would have been really cancer set in, with everyone of us because you are quite extremists that is the one which gives us balance and that's why when Kundalini rises she tries to give you cures how Christ cured people she said that something passed from my being what happened actually that when you see a sick person next to you suddenly you feel something passing from you and going into him, that is the power that power which cures first, second then it comes to a point where your mental side is in the for say chakra you can see the Heart center, Heart center is the center where God has given us a sense of security, sense of security and a desire to exist, desire to exist when this center is in difficulty you want to commit suicide. We have so many problems with this center for example women suffering from breast cancer wanted to due to this they have sort of a insecurity in their mind in their subconscious may be and that's why they suffer from it , when the Kundalini flow start she rises in to that realm and helps there and person feels absolutely seeking, then it rises higher up to this point , this is a very important point for human being because through these we have a cheat our humanness and also our freedom to an human beings because our necks are up like that, this is a very very important point, the most important i would say because there are sixty sub plexuses the maximum and here we have become human beings by this center we have brought the conscious we have got the conscious for an animal there is nothing like sin, human beings have sense of sin, if a tiger has to eat a cow it eats , he doesn't have to bother and think and worry about it the conscious is built  in here at the back that's why this is the most important thing from human point of view and this center is given to us by God by which we have discrimination power , we can discriminate if this center is correct then your hands are very sensitive and you can easily feel the divinity. but we go on compromising with our conscious it starts killing it gradually managing somehow or other bringing ourselves to the norms of the society, norms of our understanding, norms of our greed and lust. Such a conscious of course you loses the sensitivity, the conscious is placed in this centre which is excited by the rising of the Kundalini. Your conscious become very active to such an extent ,to such an extent that if you see a person who is possessed sitting next to you immediately you start getting heat from that person you get up and go to another place , you just feel the heat if you start think start thinking according to your own style of thinking and planning without doing something funny or dirty or something which is evil your vibrations will stop, you wont get vibrations your hands will start shaking and you will get heat tremendous heat in the body, the conscious become aware ,becomes aware of itself of its established of itself and it expresses itself, since realization this be your subtle being becomes aware of itself and establishes solve and glorified it such a person enjoys his virtue it doesn't cry O i am so honest that's why i am suffering Oh its a if i am honest what's a nice thing to have it , if i am crying if i am simple O what a nice thing if i am innocent how beautiful it is to be innocent,  there are so many people if i am too innocent people have cheated me oh you enjoy oh people are cheated me very good i have not cheated them thank god that's sort of a temperament should develop. In self realization your subtle being which is the holy being within you is established and glorified , is not only somebody coming and putting the hand on your head or I say baptized finished or it's not also a Braham coming and putting your thread and say no you are being born is not that, The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, it's not giving a lecture or sermon or some sort of a big show or sometimes a circus it is something that happens to you and you are the judge of yourself and you know it yourself, nobody else has to say that about you, you have certified yourself, you have enjoy yourself too like one poet in India said that with Sahaj Yoga fun would itself has started smelling its own fragrance like  the flower has started smelling its own fragrance or  a beautiful scene has started feeling its own beauty. This is what happens after Sahaj yoga and after the realization if it does not happen its not a realization because you are bathed, you are beauty, you are fragrance, you are glory and you have that joy you are, nobody has told you a lie so far if you are denied that you are going to get it, you will have to have it to know that it is so. The, this mark that I have just behind that just in the centre of the optic chiasma where the pituitary anti male bodies are placed this is very subtle centre which doctors don't know is known as the Agnya Chakra. This centre is a very great thing for so called Christians I would say because that is the centre of Christ and that is the point where you have promised your resurrection your rebirth .His message is not his crucifixion but his resurrection, the way he showing him lanky panky type and the most miserable how could he be, he knows joy and she gave us through his own resurrection he has open that door which is described I am the door for you to enter into the Kingdom of God but only by calling Christ Christ is not going to work out, the Kundalini has to rise which is says I am appeared before you like tons of flames , I would like all these priest put together to explain that to me , what does that mean how much do  they understand about Bible which they carry with them and some of these Jews they make a small little mini picture  of that and put it here, Is this the way do you think by carrying the bible on your heads, are you going to go there, there must be something that God has placed within you and that is what it is your own resurrection the right of your own resurrection of your rebirth and that is this centre which is very important. This is the blood of Christ and that is promised that resurrection , to enter into the Kingdom of God that is on top here which we call as a limbic area in the medical terminology but i have recall it Sahastrara in the Sanskrit languages that there are one thousand petals there if you cut the brain in a transverse process you can see that it looks like a petal it is like that but when you see actually the Sahastrara of an enlightened one it is like a Lotus with thousand , thousand i have not counted thousand petals which go on like this leaving petals with many colors all the with your colors are there all of them are there , many have seen , many Sahajyogies have seen that happening to them while getting realization , its not necessary to see anything but through that you are not see anything  the best you are you have the happiest landing and the smoothest one, the easiest people the simplest people  get it just like that without getting any sight or any light or anything just that they just land there but it is something like landing on the moon ,how many believed those who do not understand science, my own grandmother could not believe it and she said We are all just telling lies and even when you showed her the pictures she said oh this could be done with  on the earth only can create a cinema like that , if you can land on the sun why not in the Kingdom of God but somebody has to trigger it and surprisingly even the spacecraft is build on the same way perhaps the unconscious has given them to safe tied like telescopic, like telescope this Kundlaini rise from one to another to another to another like that, in the same way you have seen there in the spacecraft there are these what you call them placed ah different ah westibutes one into another and the first one explodes throwing one with an accelerated speed the second one explodes throwing with the accelerated speed then the third one like that and then it goes in to the space , in the same way the Kundalini acts but this also knowledge has come to us from our unconscious from nowhere else even a person like Einstein who was a realized soul not doubt he says that i was worried about my science and everything i couldn't do anything about this ah relativity and the whole theories under pond me when i was just playing with some bubbles resting in my garden and the whole things was dond up on me from some unknown area , this unknown area is the area of Kingdom of god the unconscious when it pierces this top that's the Baptism which (unknown) Baptist talking about, he was the only realized soul at that time . Today there are many more, many more are born, there are so many realized souls who are born even in your country up to 5 years of age you will find many children born, may be your children might be like that you don't know they are born realized, and there are many people I have met who are born realized maybe some of them have come might have come here whom I recognized and now they recognized me,  and they knew they had these powers in them, they were curing people and they were helping people but they didn't know what it was all about, they didn't know everything and now they have become masters of it. You have to be the masters of this Kundalini that's why you have been evolved, you have been clearing to human beings and you are to be enthroned but before doing that you had to  use your freedom, you have to be free people to choose the good the righteous the great the divine but while choosing we went to the other side of it absolutely, the brain has to be developed, your superego was developed, ego had to be developed to a point so we started from here instead of coming here in rising we just went this side. We are thinking we are planning, even they are planning about God, they trying to plan God and organize him and they are planning even the religion part of it when you see their planning capacity you are surprised and there ego that they can conceive God in their mind. This centre the top most here the kingdom of god when it opens out the light comes into your heart and you become one with a divine then from your hand cold breeze start flowing may be some people might get hot breeze ,might be in the beginning may be they are not well , there some sort of a problem ,may be that doesn't matter they will get cool breeze , a cool breeze starts flowing when it breaks , you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware , to begin with when you enter into it only you become thoughtlessly aware  you become blind if you close your eyes you can see there is no thought coming in the mind you are just listening to me that's all nothing beyond , what is from the subconscious now that to supraconscious you do not think of the future or the past but you are blank and when it breaks you find a cool breeze coming in now what is this , this is the manifestation of your spirit , yourself which is coming through ,which is expressing itself .this is called as Chaitanya Lahari in the Sanskrit language but in the bible it is described in various means. When you put your hand towards a person you can feel that person too. if he is not realized you do not get any vibrations if he is realized you get some vibrations, if he is sick you understand what is the problem, where is the problem even people who are away you can know about them because you jump into the collective consciousness. Sitting down here you can cure people, sitting down here you can give awakening but realization has to be somehow I don't know i cant help it has to be in my presence or through my photograph. There is certain compulsions they had to put because you people never recognized none of them. They are all there within us all of them are within us ready to help you to get what you have been asking for. God has not created you to be absolutely frustrated know for its fulfilment believe me it is so time has come the blossom time has come. The great time has come, this is the time has been promised in all the ancient Scriptures, this is the time it has to work and it is going to work out thousands of people are getting it and why should you get it. England is a very big place as I have told you, English people are very great too but  takes time, I find they are little difficult sometimes in the beginning but what they get it, they really scholarly  the way they sort it out they are not shifty people and I have great hopes luckily my husband was elected and he got an appointment here and I could come to London and now I'll be with you for four years to count, now I am staying in London itself so I'll be available for you. They have all souvenir made they are made they are going to take ah room here where I will reach you every Monday and I would like to solve your problems and to see that  your realization is maintained and that you achieve the calm and the peace and the complete oneness with the divine. I would work very hard I could do anything for you but only thing is that you have to also cooperate little bit, of course there's no question of paying any money whatsoever, you cannot pay for my love, can you? Sometimes I have Christ you cannot think of anything where there is no money required. You cannot pay but think what can you give pay nothing just allow me to love you that's all, if it is possible we work it out, as I have told you it is not  a thing that can be solved by rationality it has to be triggered and have to be worked out and we all should endeavor to get it through that working not through rationality which is a limited thing and if you have to rise to the unlimited realm you cannot do through this limited means that you have. It is much beyond that and that is the place where your heart, your awareness and your brain and your liver everything integrate and you become one integrated personality. All the religions all the great religions have reading you so no religion is to be condemned they have their own places all the saints, all the prophets, all the incarnations has there own places in your being  and you cannot deny it so please remember that Sahaj yoga is secularism it is capitalism because it gives you the power and it is coming from because you cannot help it but give it you have to distribute it. Is your combination of everything, May God bless you all  I hope will have the session now and I hope many of you will benefit with that apart from that we are going to have a three day seminar in our centre in Filthway from Friday, Saturday and Sunday, because these are really beautiful days and I hope ah you all will make it convenient to come there to go further with it and will try to solve your problems and also if you have any questions or impersonal problems hold  now if you have any questions you can ask me for about 10 minutes and then we can have this thing if you have really something sensible otherwise we switch to that like I read in one book this is this then mother what do you say about that, if this so that sort of a question is not going to be any of my use, by reading you cannot get to God,

No questions

Sahajyogi:

Shri Mataji:-  , We need to, it is true, it happens like that, it happens, you know what happens that fontanel bone here becomes dissolved and it is it becomes thin down and actually sometimes you say see a dimple and there was one man who is bald to see you could see the whole thorough in his head they will become suddenly, it's true that's what it should happen and I am very happy you know about it where is it written where did you learn this? where did you learn this?

In Sanskrit language, Shakti means power, inner energy is called as Shakti but you say atomic energy, electrical energy, it can be any energy like that the kundalini shakti is the power of kundalini alright. Shakti means the power any energy is Shakti but shakti in this case when we say it is the power of God , we call her also shakti , Adishakti means the primordial power , the primordial power , the one which is the integrated form which is the complete form which is the beginning which is the power of the God almighty , is Adi , Adi means the primordial , that's why it is same word Shakti means the energy is common word which means shakti , Shakti means ordinary word energy but which energy is this one , the Kundalini energy ,now the Kundalini energy also is stationed within you , this kundalini energy is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini is the primordial kundalini that was created , i have no time to tell you about the creation because its a big subject i have spoken it last time but may be next month ,will have another lecture about creation in which i will tell you about all it , how the different energies are ,how do they work out , how they are manifested within us , how they create our different mind , how do will have all these things , i will be taking you to those portions and areas also , i am here to tell you each and everything , not  a single secret , nothing everything will be note , there's no secret for a mother from her children , now those who are not feel any vibrations please come forward, please come forward , so will fill the gap also , those who are get it please close your eyes because this is a great experience ,just close your eyes and watch your thought.

how you took Pricia , good  yes please sit down, those who are not getting vibrations please sit one this thing row is there is it alright.

How are you Gordon, good , becoming a very rich man , good, sit down, why these ladies are behind please come forward you  are from the press or something , no  i thought you are from the press because press people are not supposed to take part into anything whatsoever,  without getting realization how they are going to report you just tell me , please put your hands towards me just close your eyes and i will come down myself please close your eyes , there's nothing to be afraid of , i must tell you , kundalini is your mother and all the nonsense they are described about kundalini forget it , its not like that , its the most loving mother you have had and she is the only mother you have had and you are the only child she had , and she is always follows you with you, all the time she is with you whether you are dead or living , she is always with you every moment she watching you looking after you and waiting for a moment when she can give you realization so how can she be unkind to you she cannot be she is the primmest thing that you have , but only getting the breeze is not end of it, you must know what it is, how work it out how to do it so please keep your hands towards me just like that the most magical thing I have found out that even my photograph has got the vibrations and even this mic you see carries the vibrations , actually somebody saw them, some realized souls saw them passing into singer I mean might also get it what an advantage it is.

Now most of you got the problems on the chakras that is of Christ can you imagine now why is it got caught first of all that you have to forgive, half  Christians if you believe in Christ forgiveness is his weapon and is the weapon he has given you, you must say I forgive all the people because after all its a myth if forgives what do you do nothing, you just say now I forgiven all of them so that he forgives us, forgiveness is very important, its only sickness to remember that somebody has harmed us or troubled us just say forgive us and we forgive all the rest of them, it's so important.

Fortunately this prayer is the  mantra of this chakra you have to say this prayer even in India whether its a Muslim or a Hindu or a Christian he has to say that prayer if has to excite Christ but Christians have to say some mantras for Krishna who resides here ,who can not discard him either because he himself has said those who not against me are with me , who are those who are not interpreted him properly, how can be say that i am the person having all the assets he said i am the path I am the door but he didn't say i am the destination why should you discriminate why do you say I am everything because you know he has to resurrect you he has to give you passage for rebirth and what he said he meant he knew it because he was truth , now those who are feeling cool in the hands can also feel cool coming from their heads see it for yourself if it is not then wait for a while, if it is hot coming after some time cool will start coming , feel here on fontanel bone  just feel your hand said if the cool is coming in the hand than otherwise no, it is he who looked after each and everything and it is he who has created you and he who has
