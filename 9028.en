Shri Mataji: Sit down
Sahaja Yogi: Mother? Where else should I put this? 
Shri Mataji: Here. [Shri Mataji shows her Hamsa]
Shri Mataji: Yes. I think most of them need it, a little bit. 

Shri Mataji: You see, in Sahaja Yoga, you are not given any mantra or anything. There’s no, nothing like giving you into a big course, like teaching you one after another any mantra, or anything, it’s not like that. 
What you have to know: where the Kundalini is, how it is moving, where it is, what is the charka catching and what is the mantra for that. It doesn’t take anything, hardly it takes about a week for you to understand the all thing. But gradually, as you start using it, you become proficient and you how to do it for yourself and for others. There is not much of a thing- like a child, when he comes up a little age, he starts speaking up language, because he has a built-in capacity to create sounds. And he does it. In the same way, once you get it, when you get the cool breeze in you hand, you learn it by using it, you understand it yourself, you become yourself quite proficient. And you will be amazed how fast you learn this. You don’t have to learn it just like a science book or anything, you just start learning, you can: this is charka which is catching because now, say, for example, this charka is catching [fore finger], right side. Now, there’s a mantra for this is of Shri Krishna. Say, this charka is catching [forehead], here, then there’s a mantra of Jesus Christ. Like that, you must know the mantras and the charkas. But the charkas you just know as a, absolutely, a knowledge which is built-in your nerves: you just feel it. 
This is- now this gentleman is saying: " it’s hot here" [left palm].  Alright, what is that? Hot here means what?  That’s the Sahasrara, at the left side. First it was, the Sahasrara on the right side. Now, on the left side it’s there. So that means there’s a mantra for that, and that one must be used. If you use that mantra, this will be cleared out. Alright? That is how you have to know. And that’s why I said it takes time for people sometimes to establish, because first you have to know it and then use it. 

Shri Mataji: Come along. Have you come for the first time?
Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: All right, come along. Come along this side. 

Shri Mataji: So, it is not a difficult thing, it is not at all a difficult thing to learn it, it’s very easy. You can pick it up in no time, as soon as you start using your hands on other people.

Shri Mataji: Please, be seated. Alright. 
[To a Yogi] Just see them, some people come along. 

Now these people, say-  who are the latest who have come to Sahaja Yoga? Let’s see. The latest ones.  Say, those who have come about a month back. 
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: See, he came back, she came back only one month back. And. 
Sahaja Yogini: This is his first time.
Seeker: I was here on Monday. 
Shri Mataji: How much? 
Sahaja Yogini: Ah. Ok, he was here on Monday.
Shri Mataji: Monday, alright. He’s got it. 
But you see, [to someone else] Have you been giving vibrations now? 
Lady: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: In one month, it’s done. So you can imagine. And you know about the charkas now? 
Lady: Yes. 
Shri Mataji: About the mantras? 
Lady: Yes. Not all of them. 
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see, that’s it. It’s very simple. 
If you pay attention to it, you can do it much faster. There are many people who are here, within a month, one month’s time, they pick up so many things. Many like that, within one month‘s time.  [To a Sahaja Yogi:] He’s alright. 

Because you become the knowledge. You start feeling it on your fingers, you know this is the charka. If this finger is, say, burning, [left auricular] that means your left heart is catching.  If your left heart is catching, then you know because it’s burning! Then, there’s nothing to go to the books or anything to find out, it’s just burning, it’s there. Isn’t it? That means the left heart is catching. Now, only you have to know what [Inaudible] left heart is catching, the decoding only, what does that mean. 
Your hands will speak Christ has said, alright? They will speak, I am just recording it. Now you see for self if it’s true or not. What does that mean? Left heart means there’s a problem on the heart: may be, the person is over hard working, he has forgotten about his Spirit. The mantra you have to say is: "I am the Spirit", for left heart. 
It’s so simple. Because you have forgotten about your Spirit, you are more on the right side in the sense, you are more extra- you are an extravert and more attention is outside, not towards your Spirit. Left heart is catching. 

You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well when your vibrations are steady. Now this finger, this is catching [left thumb]. Now this is catching means the person has been to somebody who s unauthorized in spiritual life. Anything, say ISP, you call it IST. Then you have got parapsychology, even psychology. Then you have got other things like all these gurus, false gurus, you can say this aura business- what else is there, just now he was telling. 
Sahaja Yogini: Supernatural, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Supernatural and under-natural, and [Big laugh]. All these things, you know, all alternatives you can think of. Anything you can think of, all these things and the books, and the Lams and the Dhamas, and every thing. [Laugh]. Even people who go, sort of adhere to a chuch too much, or adhere to Catholicism again. Because they are not connected with God and they are unauthorized.  [Shri Mataji shows her left palm].
But if you have been to a real guru, then immediately I will know. You won’t have this problem and ascent will be very fast if you have been to a real guru. But how many are real these days? In the market, only those who are marketing are they, as I said it: in the market only the buyers and the shopkeepers. It’s a market place now! 
So the real gurus are not to be seen, there are, of course I know, there are many real gurus also, but wherever they are, they are not in the market. I am the only person fighting them and telling them off, you see. None of them are willing to come down or to concede to anything, they said these human beings are hopeless.  They said: " twelve years you work Mother, then we’ll come down ". They want me alone to fight the [ordeal?]  [Shri Mataji laughs] doesn’t matter. So now, it’s a market place, where there are buyers and they are simple naïve customers. They just put such absurd things like somebody says: "alright, I want to sell a big palace, with this and that, and all that, only you have to deposit 2 thousand pounds." Alright, people will be quite willing to do: "Oh, what a bargain, let’s pay 2 thousands." And the palace may belong to the Queen. 
If you go there and ask them: "which palace you want to sell?" "This palace. " And that belongs to the Queen, you see. This is unauthorized. Unauthorized people who have nothing to do with God, who claim that they have something to do with God, which is false, and that’s why they catch on this finger [left thumb]. And what do they do? They use all these techniques; these techniques are called, in Sanskrit language, as "avidya". " Avidya"  means, non-knowledge, you can say that it’s not knowledge, something anti-knowledge, anti-God, this is anti-God. So for that the mantra is: "Shuddha vidya", means the pure technique. It’s the mantra : pure technique, it’s the mantra. "Pure" means the one that comes from the Spirit. Now what they are doing [The Sahaja Yogis] is the pure technique because it’s flowing in them. If they are moving their hands, there’s a power flowing through them and they are working it out. It’s not just a, acrobatic thing that is going on. 
So the pure knowledge: for example, the way they are raising theses candles now in my presence, and they themselves are Realized souls, it’s working out. So this is all, it’ the pure "vidya" it’s the pure knowledge and the pure technique, and those who have not done this, have gone to such people, they have put their heads before them, kneeled before them, have done something that should not have been done! So this is it. 
And that’s how if you catch on this finger, this thumb, left hand, that means a person has been to somebody like that. But, with that, if you have any catch on this Void [on the palm], or Void here in the stomach part- this is left Swaddithana, it’s placed here down below, which moves like that all over, and this becomes right Swaddisthana, this side.  Now supposing a person catches all round here, his Void, and all round here.
Seeker: How do you call it? 
Shri Mataji: It’s called as the Void, we call it Void. It’s not the Zen Void. But the Void is the crossing point which is, it’s the viscera, it’s the stomach part,  where-abdomen you can call it, abdomen part -  and this part, if it is catching that means these are the ten principles of the guru. If this is catching, means you have hurt your principle of guru, your principle of a master. That means you have gone to some very wrong master.  If this is catching, that means that. Now, just now as they said, his Void is catching. The Kundalini will be wobbling there, you can see it with your own eyes also. You can see the Kundalini just potting [?] – pulsating there, you can see the all stomach going into a trauma. And then you have to say the mantra of the Primordial master. Anyone you can do it you see, Guru Nanaka’s name you can take,  Muhammad’s name you can take, all of them are Prophets. Moses’ name, Abraham, all these are there. So if you take their names, the Kundalini can be brought up. You can strengthen that part, then the Kundalini’s pushed up. 

So all these so-called Yogas,  also like physical yoga. Now, in the physical Yoga, you will catch this finger [right annular], this one [right major] and this finger [left auricular]. This ring finger here and this finger [left auricular]. This is heart, means you have been paying too much attention to your physical thing. Anybody who is working also physically too much can also catch this, plus this [right annular]. Because when you go into action too much, also, as a result of that, the fumes or your actions create your ego.  And this is one of the biggest problem of the West you see, they are not aware that they have an ego. But after Realization they start seeing the ballon ....
