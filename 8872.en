[translated from Hindi]

On today’s auspicious occasion we have gathered here. Today is the 7th day of the Goddess. On the 7th day, the Devi Goddess destroyed the various rakshasas and sinners, because they were torturing the great saints and rishis who were doing meditation and penance.

We wonder, ‘Mother, why they did so much penance? What was the need?’ The reason for doing it was because although human ascent was still low, yet their aspiration was very high. They aspired to achieve the Atma through the body. That is why they worked so hard and did penance in this place. It is due to their aspiration that today we are able to achieve this height. This does not mean that we should think that because of the blessing of Sahaja Yoga we are some great people or some specially chosen people by God. People who think like that will receive a great shock. You will see that those who are simple, innocent, and good-natured will ascend foremost and the rest will be left behind. Therefore just receiving your Realization is not the end.

On this auspicious occasion God Almighty has manifested all His shaktis for your protection, benevolence and welfare. In everything God is blessing you. He wants to see you enter His kingdom. In a way it is His desire that you should return to your Father’s home and enjoy its comforts. But at least we should be worthy of it. If we are not worthy of it then how can we enter it? We should examine our worthiness and see what it is.

The first thing is that you should come to your Father’s house. Today I have also come to my Father’s house. I feel like that because Himalaya is my Father. On coming here, I cannot express in words the feelings that are rising within me, but I think that today I have found a great occasion to celebrate the glory of my Father. A great opportunity has come before me to praise the glories of my Father and narrate the great achievements of those who meditated here. With the inspiration derived from the Himalayas they rose from nowhere to such heights that they achieved the highest state.

The Himalayas are the Sahastrara that Mother Earth has created for you. This Sahastrara is to be worshipped. This Sahastrara is very great. I don’t know if you can see vibrations emitting from it. I am completely engulfed by their vibrations that I cannot see anything else. There are only vibrations and vibrations. Nothing else.

Those who are residing here are swimming in vibrations and seem like fish swimming in the ocean of vibrations. You cannot distinguish one from the other. I cannot describe in words the splendour of the beautiful vibrations that are spread here. This is indeed the blessings of the Himalayas.

Foremost we recognize the ocean as our Guru. The ocean is our Father. When the ocean leaves behind all the dirt of the World that is dumped into it and rises in the sky as clouds, then it becomes completely pure and beautiful. Floating in this state it reaches the feet of the Himalayas and spreads as ‘Him.’ The word dhaula means ‘completely pure’, nirmal. Dhar means ‘range.’ (The mountain range is called Dhauladhar.) Like these pure ranges in the Himalayas, they are also to be found in our brain, where they support an opening of the Sahastrara. After this I cannot describe any further but I can say this, that the auspicious opportunity has come today of this connection; try to avail it and go to its depth. Think that before it, we are a dot of sand, an innocent child. There is nothing so special in us that we can stand before its majesty. What are we? It is so awesome!

The Himalayas are the Sahastrara of the whole Universe. They have given the whole Universe so much comfort and joy after which there is nothing more to be attained. With the help of this Sahastrara, I have opened your Sahastraras. With the help of this Sahastrara, I have realized that till the peace of the Himalayas settles in you, till its greatness penetrates your behaviour, it is useless to open your Sahastrara. Otherwise your Sahastrara will burn like a furnace. When I see a furnace burning inside some people I wonder O God! Why did I open his Sahastrar? There is so much smoke and negativity coming out that it is better that his Sahastrar closes. Like the opening of Pandora’s Box, one does not know what all is coming out. It is shocking to see snakes, scorpions and all the possible negativity being thrown out of it.

Today we worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are here, and pray to them to bless us with Devi Shakti. We have received the blessings of the Devi Shakti from a Mother. That is why, in the form of Mother, let us come to the feet (Sharanagat) of the Himalayas.

Keep your attention on yourself. People think of others. They think, ‘this person is bad. That person is not good. That fellow is not good.’ What about yourself? See yourself. Don’t look at others. ‘This fellow does not do this, that fellow does not do that.’ Watch what you are doing.

Himalaya does not see what the World has done with Him. How much they have exploited Him. He only sees what He has to give, what hard work He must do. How to nurture the people? How to protect them? We have gotten our protection from Himalaya’s Peak. From it we received the streams of Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati. All these streams flow within us, nirmal, despite all the negativity we throw in them. Despite the way we disrespect them. Yet, Himalaya unhesitatingly flows His purity in them. But all such things will soon end, they cannot go on forever.

You should remember that I should find sweetness in your tongue, sweetness in your talk, tenderness in your behavior. I am warning you that now I will not forgive. To hurt anyone in any way is a great sin. Kindly respect each other. You are a Sahaja Yogi. The other is also a Sahaja Yogi. Today you may hold a certain position which the other person may not have; you have not achieved this position, I have bestowed it upon you. I can remove you from it whenever I please. That is why, please become worthy of it. With great humility serve others.

Many people have reported to me that, ‘Mother, we will only attend your lectures but not go to the centre.’ I am very surprised that thousands attend my lectures, then why do they get lost? Are you blocking them in between like some negativity? Kindly pay attention to what I am saying and look at yourself. Do not look at others.

What is it that I did? Did I do it like that? Why did I do like that? Then you will know, you will understand, when you will realize your mistake. Then only you will be able to correct yourself; then only you will be able to recognize the greatness of this Himalaya. Otherwise you will not be able to comprehend it. You lack that perception, that vision, that maturity, that discretion to realize what it is. Where you have come, in whose lap are you sitting, in whose lap you were born, nurtured, brought up; that is this great Father of ours.

Honour it’s glory and, in paying homage to it, prove that the work you are doing will be fruitful and will not be wasted.

In this way there is the great blessing of the seven Goddesses upon you – they are like your maternal aunts. They look after your welfare. There is a saying that even if the mother dies, the maternal aunt should not die because the maternal aunt lovingly indulges the child. She looks after him, plays with him, amuses him, protects him from hardships.

You can witness the movement of clouds in the sky, making patterns in myriads of colours and hues, in breath-taking vistas. These are all plays to drench you with beauty. There is a lot to be gained here. It is to be seen that after receiving Blessings of Peace, how beautiful you become.

This Puja is very special, many will go deep and receive tremendous blessings. But first make your attention steady. In your attention pray for peace, “Mother, please bestow peace upon me.” Pray for peace so that you may spread peace in the Universe. Then Joy will come. Joy cannot come without Peace.

It will work out tremendously. I know it will work out, because I have really tried first of all to curb you down, and after curbing you down I think you people should ascend because many things have fallen out.

Now don’t try to gather them or go back to them and justify. Try to be without them.

May God Bless you.
