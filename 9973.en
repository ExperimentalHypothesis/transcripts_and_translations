1994-10-08 Concert of Nishat Khan, Eve Of Navaratri Puja, Cabella, Italy

Shri Mataji: His name all you know, Nishant Khan, But some or other he has such a fascination for playing here is something very I feel miraculous and kind of a holy alliance that I can not explain. And he is not only a very good player and all that, artist but a very humble man, very humble. And When I say he feels shy sometimes the way he is humble to me. You see this, artist is a very great example also because many people are against each other in the artistic world very much. And some people said that he is a Muslim so why should he play anything, they are not allowed in the Koran ...I said  I don't believe that. Mohammad Sahib could not have said such a thing. And all nonsense, how could he have said such nonsensical things ...He was a very sensible personality. So all kinds of arguments people give. It shows the smallness of their mind,& also in a way they are insulting Mohammad Sahib. I think this type of taboo and nonsense has to go away. I have told many a time that how difficult it is, to follow Christianity. Because Christ has said that If you commit sin from your one eye, take it out. Take out another eye if you commit mistakes. And cut your hand, if you have done any wrong thing. So to me,  I have not seen any Christian without 2 eyes and 2 hands. It's very difficult to follow Christ.  Christ told You do it! But Mohammad Sahib, said No, No Let others should do it. Mohammad Sahib said that It should be done by others ...If you do anything wrong, if you have a bad eye, Even to look at a woman twice, is a 'Gunah '(sin ) according to him. But take out your eyes and cut your hands if you are a thief, or he says that ... A very interesting thing he has said about also woman because he thought that Christ is only talking about men. He was so restricted to men. Why not about a woman also. But both these people never knew what human beings are! Really  I think they were too great! Too pure and I think all these punishments are for saints or Sahaja Yogis and not for normal people. Normal people will give without their eyes in no time if the men loos or a woman looks at the men. So Its a very very difficult religion ...Both of them ...And the Jews, are no less. All these three people or religions are not easy to follow or a normal person. They have to be first saints and Sahaja yogis so that it becomes easy for them to follow. That's why I will tell them that first to become Sahaja yogis then become Muslims. Otherwise, you can't follow them. The punishments are too much. Even Guru Nanka had punishments for the people like that. We had our minister who had to clean the shoes of all the people who were coming to the Puja ...So I didn't understand He said No No It is written ...that you should do such and such thing you better clean the shoes of all the people or 'Sadhakas' who are coming there. But In Sahaja  Yoga, we have no such punishments. Its Love ...Its forgiveness ...First, you become a saint, then we will do the punishment part ...First, you have to become a saint. So there is no punishment. Its only Love, as you have seen that. Because When I see...when I went to America, I said Baba! All these American will has to loose their eyes, and hands because the woman will have to be put in the [unclear] 04:53 And would be hit because the way they have no moral sense at all.

And these people talk of morality, morality ...And there is no sense of morality. So Sahaja Yoga is a very right thing to do because with that you become a saint, and after becoming a saint, you automatically become a Muslim, a Hindu and a Jew, good Christian and a good Sikh everything ...Because you just become. You can't help it. You become 'Dharmic' So you have to take first of all to your realisation. And then talk of religion, before that I don't think that anybody can follow such religions where you have to take out your eyes and hands. So also when they say there is no Music, should be now music ...I mean God can't live without music, one has to understand. God has to live with Music and this kind of absurd ideas. There are many people or other obscenities. The other day I met some other people, in say Chicago! So one fellow was there He was a 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna'. And it was very cold like this you see...And he was wearing a 'Dhoti' So I said why are you wearing a 'Dhoti'? I felt really pity for him you know...the way he was wearing 'Dhoti'. He said my guru has initiated and he told that I should wear the 'Dhoti'.I said your guru has no kindness for you. You are in Chicago ...You are not in India ...See In India, people wear 'Dhoti' all right. She said No the guru said If you wear 'Dhoti', you will get 'Nirvana'.I said then 80% Indian will get Nirvana also. Use your logic only by wearing 'Dhoti' if you are going to get 'nirvana' then it is the easiest way to do. 06:42 [unclear ]

I said Krishna has said one thing not to get to temper because temper because temper is the worst according to him. And he was quite surprised. He said have you read 'Gita'? I said perhaps I have! But you better now wear something to cover yourself and this 'Dhoti' won't do ...Because I am a mother and I can't see my children like this in a Dhoti shivering here, sitting around. They couldn't even listen to my lecture they were so old. [unclear ] By wearing Dhoti I never heard that you will go to heaven. Who has said this? Such a stupid idea they have ...So we have no obscenities. Obscenities are against Sahaja. 'Sahaja' is the one, where you live in a Sahaja way, You get your realisation like Gurunanka has said 'sahaja samadhi  lago '. It should be Sahaja. You see all of them has said the same thing ...Even Mohammed Sahib had said the same thing -The problem is this that, this kind of restrictions if you put on some person who is a normal person (not a saint), is going to be terrible. How many people will exist with these kinds of thing that go on? So to understand them, first, you must get your realisation, that is very important ...Must get your realisation, so you will understand what Mohammad Sahib is! You will understand what Christ is! You will understand What Krishna is! Before that, you see ...You just go on criticizing, You see this kind of punishment is there ...Punishment of wearing a Dhoti also...I think this is a kind of punishment. Why should you wear a Dhoti in a cold like Chicago Where people are freezing ...You are wearing a Dhoti ...So this kind of nonsensical ideas are not in Sahaja. You dress up the way you like. You wear proper dresses. You will be looked after.

Now As it is, you see ...our artist is feeling rather cold, so I was thinking bring them one heater there So they will feel better. [In Hindi -I am feeling it ]

Go in Spontaneity.[Sahaja] .There is joy in it...

(Shri Mataji Showing Artist's Sitar to Sahaja yogis )

Can you see a Rakhi tied to the Sitar ...That's how they respect the instrument that they have.

This is Mother's court. Be comfortable first.[Mother says to artists]

He told me that he will be playing Shankara for the first time ...As it's a very beautiful raga. Today is Navaratri. Had forgotten? [mother asks from artist and laughs  ]...

On the Navratri, he said he will play 'Shankara' and I remembered it ! and Durga too!

He said it is the raga played in the second half, and is a raga of only actually five notes and while going upward as we call it 'Aroha' is only 4.And 'Avroha' is 5. So its a very limited, its a very limited raga, in the sense. There are many others also like Durga, I would say also 'Gunkali '.All this raga are also like that ...But you will be surprised to know that Japanese play 'Guna Kali' And when we play before them they are amazed that how can you extend it to that limit ...So you play relax-fully .... 'Shankara'

And he also says that Alap means the slow movement What we call 'vilamb'. It is difficult in that and still, he will manage I know...( Mother smiles ...and performance gets started )

What is the name of the person in tabla?

Artist replied Sukhwinder Singh ...

Mother says Sukhwinder Singh means the one who gave the joy and happiness ...No, I haven't heard you before I must say ...I have never ...I have heard his name but I never heard him ...And we are all very fortunate that he is here and We are going to enjoy him very much. Thank You!

[ Performances starts ]......15:31

Shri Mataji appreciates their performance...

You see every university is called a family. Is a Gharana as you call it ...and he comes from a Gharana which is very well known ...His father was great......He is still there in the [unclear /middle-grade sitarist ] and his uncle[unclear/I have heard him] also. A very good sitarist ...They are really great people ...The whole family What we call is a [unclear /Guicui style is ] means based on the song ...On the song it is based This is sort of a thing So it is very appealing (the song) but if it is without 'guyaki ' then you feel it's very dry...so this whole family has dedicated to the sense ...See the beauty that he has of the song ...But in Song, you can not sing like this ...the way you can play it on Sitar ...

[Performance starts again ]

Very kind to give this recital from there heart ...So very deep, subtle, experience We all have enjoyed because of their hard work. Now I think you people are understanding, Indian Classical Music more than me ...So I need not explain to you. But only one or two points which are important to always notice the offbeat when he was playing to understand the offbeat play .....He plays offbeat sometimes slow sometimes fast suddenly ...It's a very mathematical thing. They must be mathematician  you see...both of them ...Otherwise not possible because it's like a what we call...is a 'Bandish'.Means It is in the  Maraydas. Now suddenly he would go fast, in the same 'avartan'(means, when the tabla is in same 16 bits suddenly he for-beats, will go fast, then he slow then he will fast. It's something very remarkable ... With that, the tabla is also moving...Now it is a great Mathematics, Which works it out ...Because he has to come to the first note in any way. And in this coming to the first note, he should know how to multiply ...And how to divide ...

You see...It's very intricate work and some of you are the professors of mathematics, here sitting ...You can also see ...How it has worked out ...

So it is also Creativity no doubt. It's a natural Creativity. Not a firm wok ...They work very hard just called as 'Riyaz'...Without that you can not achieve this every day to day, perfection the way they have! And the mathematics part of it is so genuine and so innate but they have studied it ...It's not that it's just coming to them, just they are sitting here and singing It's not like that. Of course, they have the creativity and they are showing every time new pattern and all that, but is all built-in before ...And they have worked very hard with their Gurus and done so much of 'Tapasya' that is- the practice. This is the science, a very subtle science, of mathematics, and of music and the sweetness ...otherwise you can not do it. If its mathematics it becomes very much dry!... But if it is without mathematics,also it could be irrelevant  ...Now you are all enjoying it so well and next time you have offbeat music ...Try to see how they manage the mathematical calculation ...This is more than calculus. I can tell you this way ... And some time high, get lost [unclear] ... So this is something which is a very intricate science of  Indian classical Music  Which you can see also in your classical Music also and enjoy that very much  ... And all of them were great composers. But there is no composer It is they compose all the time you see ... the record between us and them ...And they compose all the time though they know like Aeroplane is fixed you see... So they are fixed first of all nicely by the guru and then they fly ...And then they can fly anywhere because their aeroplanes have become fixed So all the melodies are fixed. The systems are fixed. But they can go to whatever height they want. So This is something very Divine Music. Because It's not possible in any Music ...You have to have always something written down before you ...You have to see what are the notings are ...and you have to play accordingly ...It's already been, have been, composed. No, But they have that such deep training from their Gharanas and from their  Gurus. This dedication to gurus has brought this. There are somethings that I always feel that  Indian Musicians are something 'Gandharvas' because this music nobody can sing ...nobody can play. It is impossible. Try! I mean he must be having some disciples and so ...It's difficult but at least you people are enjoying it is a very great thing. In next life, you might become great Musicians if possibly but just now I think you know ...I also ...I am nowhere compared to them. I can only listen,  appreciate, understand, enjoy and that what we have to do ...And we must thank you very much for bringing this great music to us in this far fletched place called Cabella ...And every time he plays in a different manner and in a different creative mood he creates...I don't know what to say more because all these ragas you know very well ... And the way he has rendered it is remarkable ...All the permutations and combination I have never saw him repeating even once the same line ...This is the biggest thing and the same thing I would say to Sukhwinder Singh . He too never repeated the 'mukhdas'.Every time he played different, It's very remarkable, very remarkable ...Because you see I told you that my family was [unclear].They had an addiction to Music. All of them. Morning till Evening in my family, nothing but music, music ...And I knew 4 o'clock they use to get up to practice ... And this is how they achieved lots of things but these are something rare birds I should say ...in the realm of music. I really want to congratulate you very much. And all my blessings for you to get to the deeper and subtler side. We need it very much because this builds up our  'Maryada'. This builds up our 'Dharma'. It builds up our ascent ...So such musicians are to be really respected and appreciated ...I know my father, He `would not eat his food if he has to go to the music program ...He would never sit before the musician have sat down. He had such respect for this art ...And he said that you know...One day will come that the whole world will understand, that India has such a divine Music ...And now you can see how you all are enjoying ...It's my dream being fulfilled you know ...I feel that this Music should spread everywhere. Also, You have classical Music too, but nobody wants to hear it ...Nobody wants to listen here ...We have great Musicians here ...

You listen to Wadly & Vardly both...You will get surprised...

They were really such great musician I men you can just get lost with them. Next time when you will come we will give you the present ...It's really remarkable ...So we all enjoyed it very much and this no amount of grace can really express our feeling, & the joy we had. So again I thank you very much Again Again ...100 times ...
