[Starts at 1:11]
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Musicians have arrived now or even they’ll join us, later on.
Guido: I think they are some children show first. So they may have time.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Hello.

[Laughter. Applause]
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

[American’s collective dance]
Sahaja Yogi: American Sahaja Yogis.

Is there a copy? All Right. I think you’d better do the coping. I’m not seeing anything.

Jose: When is Babamama arriving?

[Jose's caricatures and imitations of some Sahaja Yogis]
Jose: Shri Mataji, in your lectures sometimes you talk about confused Sahaja Yogis, that sometimes we are all of us a little bit confused in some situations. We must admit that all of us we have gone through that through those situations where we don't really know what is going on and we feel sometimes we're not very sure and very secure about what we are doing. So, this is the insecure Sahaja Yogi.

These are the two different answers from Sahaja Yogis when you have a problem. This was in Italy, actually it was in Turkey. And we were all nicely around a restaurant table, and we were all nicely having fun together. And one Sahaja Yogini asked
-Guido how can we overcome our ego?
-You see, I cannot tell you because I have no ego.
And this is the answer from Akbar:
-You must take a big wall and you must bang your head against the wall.

And this is another answer of Akbar to one Sahaja Yogi who was very stressed and wanted to know where we going to sleep tonight for the seminar.
-But Akbar, where are we going to sleep can you tell me it's place for 200 people, we are 700, how are we going to sleep? Akbar please.
-Well, you know, in Sahaja Yoga, the Mother Earth is your mattress and the sky, the stars, the whole universe is your blanket.

Lady (daughter of Shri Mataji?): Can you do Gregoire?
Jose: This, I think I did last time. But I think, maybe, you would like to see it again Shri Mataji, what happens at the back of the scene, in Ganapatipule, while the musicians are playing and while the front part of the scene is enjoying. At the back part of the scene, some are following the advises of Dr Rustom that:
-We should just go on the left. If you feel you're going on the left side, during the bhajans, it will work out if you go in the back and sleep.
So, these are the different Sahaja Yogis.
This is Brian Wells:
-You see, it's not that I don’t like bhajans, but the problem is when the bhajans go after 1 o’clock in the morning, I just can't stand them.

This is an Australian Sahaja Yogi. This is another Australian, trying to keep smiling.

And this is Dr David Spiro:
-Well, you know, I think, I think everything will work out in Shudy Camp. I just think everything is ...

And this is Yoan Cokker [unsure].

[Applause]

And these are two of one famous imitation that I don't need to tell the name, because we just have the Puja in Milan. So, everybody knows me. Two new stories about our friend
Ravier.
One story with Jovert, Jovert.

So, Javert comes to me, Javert.
-Ravier, this is the program we have to work on the people. So, Ravier says:
-Yes, but you have to concentrate on the quality people. So, you have to concentrate on the quality people. See for example, you have to work on this one there. You have to work on this fellow.
-But why do you have to work on this fellow?
-Because he's a quality people, you understand, you have to work on him.
-How is he a quality people?
-He came to the program in a Mercedes.

And this is s one of Ravier that I invented myself. So, don't blame him.

Ravier is at the Guru Puja in the Austria, Italy this year, and Ravier says:
-This is the best puja for Milan because the Austrians organize and the Italians get the vibrations, because it is in Italy.

But for Guido, quality people is different. For Guido, look at these Milanese people, they prepare a seminar and they forget to bring the ibiscus oil for massage. They forget to bring a good film and they also forget the football.

Sahaja Yogi: Bravo. Kingsley.
Jose: Ah! Kingsley, I was forgetting someone, I knew. So, there are two new ones of Kingsley. Actually, they're old ones but now people start to tell me the stories about others and they wanted to be anonymous so, I won't tell the name of those who told me the stories. So, Kingsley:
-He is just amazing, that was someone living in the ashram with Kingsley, I think.
-I mean once Kingsley was absolutely furious! He was really furious, I mean:
-Gosh, it was really too much. So, Kingsley said:
-Mike ?, he said, Mike?, but I can't forgive him really - he is talking about another Sahaja Yogi - I can't forgive him. OK, I will forgive him. Yes, I will forgive him. I will forgive him, no problem. But let me kill him first, please.

And the other one of Kingsley was:
-Before Sahaja yoga, I was my own false Guru.

[Sahaja Yogis ask for an imitation of Gregoire]
So, this is the last one of Gregoire in Turkey. So, this is supposed to be a hoover in a hotel in Turkey. And this is Gregoire planning what he's going to do today.
-[In French] "Mais tu comprends, d’abord, on va aller à Agia Sophia". Pistachios are very good! Now we're going to see Agia Sophia. Then we're going to go to the mosque. Then after the mosque, we're going to go shopping. Then after the shopping, we return to Agia Sophia. Then we -what do you think? What do you think? Good, good idea. Good idea. Good idea. Ok, let's do it. Ok, Agia Sophia, Temple, Bazard, shopping, OK. It happened in front of Jose oh no!

Now Mr Pie. Mr Pie? Now we're going to read mantas, we're going to start with the mantra. So, we start right now with the mantra.
So, and this is Dr Nasik:
-Come along, Guido! Dr Sangue. Come along Guido, we are having a dance, you know. Come enjoy the food, the musicians, the Alibag dance. Come along.

Ok, so Juan will do Mr Venugopalan. And I will be doing Mrs Venugopalan.
-So, dear Sahaja Yogis, brothers and sisters, I would like first to tell you that we have a very interesting announcement for you all today. Board of directors of Nirmala Yoga will be composed by Mr Lal, Mr Subramanian and myself, of course. And now I would like to introduce you, dear brothers and sisters Sahaja Yogis, to my wife. She's a very great singer. She has a very beautiful voice. And she will entertain you with some music tonight. After this, you're all invited to my house. In my house, we have hot water, cold water, half cold water and half hot water. And all this in a very nice marble bathroom. So, I will let you enjoy the singing of my great singer wife.

[Jose sings]

Lady (daughter of Shri Mataji?): Doctor Spiro?
Jose: I think our Babamama is playing me a trick. He’s just eating longer so that Jose can go with his imitations. But the night is still young.
-I would like to relate to you a story, not a story but just a technique in Sahaja Yoga. Because we're talking of all these different techniques, so I would like to remind you one technique which was taught to me some time ago. This was in the beginnings of Sahaja Yoga in England. And uh this is a technique, a very simple technique, which is technique with a piece of grass. So, I know everybody of you can find a piece of grass. It's quite easy especially in Switzerland, it's raining so much you know. But maybe Dr Rustom in his desert he'll find some problems, but in any case, you just take this piece of grass and you just nicely vibrate it with your fingers, you know. Well just nicely give it vibrations on the piece of grass. Then you just think of the problem, but of course, don't think too much because it won't help. Then you just tie a knot on the piece of grass and you tie a knot and you forget about the problem or you try to forget about the problem. And then you just throw the piece of grass and you'll find it works out. I found it works out for me so why not for you too? Eventually if you have a lot of problem problems, you’d better find yourself in a big field because you'll have some.

If you have any problem in India tour, you’ll have to consult your doctors. So, one of the doctors who has to be consulted is Dr Spiro. But Dr Spiro has a lot of things to do also in India. So, he'll teach you the simple ways of curing yourself.
-So, Dr Spiro, what do we do with diarrhoea problems?
-Well, what I'm going to answer about that- I think the simple way being in India, you see, you have to if you have diarrhoea problems, then you just take to bananas.
-And what is the problem if we if we have a constipation problem?
-Well, you just take to guavas.

Which one next?
Daughter of Shri Mataji: That one when you said where Mataji told everyone to love all the Sahaja Yogis.
So, this is a story also happened some years ago, and we were listening to one of Shri Mataji's tapes where she was telling us that we should love each other, we should smile to each other, we should be loving to each other. So, one newly Sahaja Yogi was just coming feeling very good after the tape. So, he just wanted to smile to another one who seemed to be an old Sahaja Yogi and who was not willing to smile.

-You know, I just did not have the chance to meet you all here this time. You know I was traveling all over. I used to tell Sahaja Yogis, Well, I know, I won't see you next time. But every time I would come back ,you know. And this is me. This is Harsh.
Jose: Well, I don't I know if all of you do know the story about the public program, but I think I'll have to tell you again, because I don't have any other sketch of him. you know. So ? was this fellow, you know, he had a such a Back-Agnya you know. So, Mataji told me, "Just work on him ", you know the fellow just arrived to me, you know, and the whole thing was going out. When I looked at him there was one eye going this side one eye going this side. And even he had a third eye going straight before you. You know really, it was something working on him.

These are the different names of Babamama, because Babamama has found that in Europe, he has different names. Not only Babamama, but when he goes to Austria his name is Papamama. When he goes to Italy, his name is “hey Baba Mama’. When he goes to England it's Babemame. When he goes to Spain, he's Vavamama. When he goes to Swiss Germany, Papamama. And when he goes to France Babamama.

And we are still waiting for him.

[51:01; Shri Mataji is talking, comment 1]
Shri Mataji: Ah, we can have some music from you people?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Before he comes. We can have some music, all right. Now real name of Babamama, who knows? Let’s see. That’s the question. Who knows Babamama’s real name?
Granddaughter: I know
Shri Mataji: No, not you. Anybody else who knows Babamama’s real name?
All right, lets it, have some questions.
Sahaja Yogi: You have a mike for Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Hello, now what’s the real name of Babamama?

Sahaja Yogi: I know the initials, Shri Mataji, are H. P.
Shri Mataji: No.
Prakash: Hemendra Kumar Salve.
Sahaja Yogi: Harry Prasad
Shri Mataji: No, no.
Granddaughter: He knows
Prakash: Hemendra Kumar Salve.
Shri Mataji Correct. Hemendra Kumar his name and how do you know his name?
Prakash: Because I was doing the papers for the invitation of the musicians in Paris.
Sahaja Yogi: For the visa.
Shri Mataji: Ah! [Laughter] All right. That’s it.

You see, we had some acrobat, in India, when he was very young. And he was a Hatha Yogi sort of a fellow. He used to walk on the fire and he used to put his stomach inside so much that you could put a, I mean, completely your hand inside. It was like this. He pulled the stomach so much.
Guido: Fakir.
Shri Mataji: Some sort of a thing like that. And then you could break something, a heavy thing on his chest, sort of thing, you see this. So, his name was Hemendra Kumar. So, Babamama was very much enamoured by him, you see, and my mother especially. So, she called him Hemendra Kumar.
Gregoire: Ah, I see.
Shri Mataji: That’s how he gets the name.

In India, we don’t have names without meanings. For example, ‘Jose’, what is the meaning of the word? Must be something, Joseph or something? Joseph, Jose is Joseph.
Sahaja Yogi: Something with the Judgement of God.
Shri Mataji: Is it? But, you see, so many have this name, ‘Jose’, sort of a first name. And Maria as a first name for ladies.
Guido: Yes.
Shri Mataji: It’s very common.
Guido: Jose-Antonio, Jose ...
Shri Mataji: Ah! We have so many Joses, there are many Joses, you see. So, when you say ‘Jose’, you mean which Jose? There’s lot of things in the name also. Like, I was asking for the name of the place where we were. So, I said, "What’s the name of this mountain?" So they said, "The name of this mountain, the meaning is grin, grinning, when the dog who is angry, what he does is to grin". So, I said, "Why give this name to this?" [Laughter] I mean, I didn’t understand. And then they said what’s the name, what’s the meaning of the word Lecco, you see. Just being Indian, I asked, "What’s the name of this word Lecco?" Because you remember, you see, if you know the meaning, you remember. So, they said that means ‘meat’. I said, "Meat? For the lake? I can’t understand". What is -
Guido: The lake was Carnate, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Carnate, sorry, Carnate. "What is the meaning of Carnate?" They said ‘meat’. So, we are living in meat or what? [Laughter]
And what was the Lecco?
Guido: Lecco means to leak.
Shri Mataji: Ah! Lecco means to leak. You see now, what does the leak has to do with the lake? I mean, no connection whatsoever! I was wondering how these names are there, you see.
But they are without any meanings, while Indians names are so full of meanings. But if you give funny names to somebody, then you don’t know how to even pronounce them, because they are very funny meaning, very - something very funny. So, sometimes, I think, if it is meaningless, it is better. So that there is no problem.

And one gentleman’s name was [Parpute ?], means the one who runs away from the fields, you see. All kinds of names! And Marathi names are the worst of all, because surnames, because they did not know how many surnames to have. So, somebody’s name is [Hatwurli] means the one who twists your hand. [Laughter]
And English surnames are even worse. For example, they’ll call somebody a stone. You know, in India, if you call somebody a stone, he’ll beat you. And they call you ‘lamb’. If you call somebody a lamb, or a donkey, it’s too much, isn’t it? But these are the things are.
But some languages have no meanings at all to their names. No meaning at all. But when you go deep into it, then you find the meanings are horrifying. So, I think we should find out what is our surname, why this surname has come to us, what were our forefathers doing, you see. It would be a good idea to find out about it.
So, Babamama has not come, but you all can have your own music. Let’s have it from you people.

They are tired. I think they went out shopping. [Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, they will be arriving in ten minutes. So we can prepare.
Shri Mataji: Oh! They won’t arrive.

[58:57]
Sahaja Yogi: So, just while the musicians are getting setting up their equipment, I just thought that people might be interested -in fact, I know that people will be interested to hear about what has been actually a very historic and very important few days. I'm actually slightly not in touch with the timing of all this because the last few days has been something of a whirlwind. So, if you'll just bear with me while I try and remember what day it is today. Very good. So, on Thursday, I had the great honour and privilege to escort Shri Mataji from Heathrow airport to Moscow. And it was a flight that lasted about two and a half hours and we arrived in Moscow. And we were met by Oleg who is the leader in Moscow. And Shri Mataji and Oleg were there with Rajesh. Rajesh Shah who was there in Moscow, who had months in advance actually arranged to be in Moscow on business. And the reason why we went was because Yogi Mahajan had actually been in Moscow and had met some bureaucrats from a cultural, a Ministry to do with cultural exchange; in particular, an exchange between India and the Soviet Union. And something I wasn't aware of, was that actually the links between India and the Soviet Union are of course very strong and there are lots of business links and lots of different things that go on. For example, there is a combined Russian and Indian restaurant called ‘The Delhi restaurant’ in Moscow. And in a part of this restaurant, you can pay for your meal in rupees and in the other part you actually pay in Rubles. And so there are already strong links between India and Moscow, and Russia and the Soviet Union.
And I stayed at the airport and waited for Yogi Mahajan to come and for Bogdan to arrive. And then we all went to this hotel where Shri Mataji was waiting. And we spent an evening, the first evening, talking to the Russian Yogis. They were something like ten people there, Oleg was the leader. And out of the ten people, probably four or five of them have a fairly good understanding of Sahaja Yoga and certainly recognized Shri Mataji. And some of the others are in very early days. And the following morning we waited to find out what Yogi Mahajan had arranged and he arrived with a Minister from the association for Indian and Soviet relationships. And we went in a convoy of cars to this Ministry where Shri Mataji gave a press conference. And it was an extraordinary press conference. There was a long table and a whole lot of reporters, altogether probably thirty, thirty-five people in the room. And first of all, Yogi Mahajan stood up and um gave a polite and pleasant introduction and then introduced Shri Mataji.

And Shri Mataji stood up with a chakra Charlie on the wall and gave a very simple talk about how the spontaneous energy comes awake and goes through the subtle system. And She gave a very simple talk about how people who have this experience blossom and have a new energy and are cured of all sorts of illnesses. And then she sat down. And one of the ministers actually, the leading Minister for this association said, “Well I have one question. Because Shri Mataji asked for any questions. And he said, "How does this happen? How does this come about?" And instead of giving any kind of complicated answer, Shri Mataji stood up and said, "Well, I'll show you". And She came back to the front of the room and She said, "Now first of all, you put your hand on here. And then you move it down above your ribs. And then you move it down again. And then you put it back here". And She went through the motion and said, "Now you must all close your eyes". And the atmosphere in this room was quite extraordinary. I mean, some of these journalists were looking at each other and I was sitting next to a professor of psychiatry who was starting to look a bit bewildered. [Laughter]

And Shri Mataji was - became very playful. She started laughing and said, "It's easy you know, I'll show you. I mean, I can answer your questions, but it's much easier to show you". And so She went ahead and gave this whole room Realization. And several people actually had quite a strong experience including this professor of psychiatry. And then we, various people stood up and gave talks. I stood up and talked a little bit about drug addiction and about the right side and the left side. And Dr Bogdan stood up and talked about some medical experiences he'd had. And then Rajesh Shah stood up and described how a strike in his company in India had just changed as a result of Shri Mataji's advice and that the workers had thrown out the union leader and were earning much more than they'd ever earned. And now that the productivity of the company was much better and links with the Soviet Union were much better. And we had a pleasant and informative session and then we left for lunch.

And the lunch was one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen. Because we sat at this long table, in a very pleasant Indian restaurant, and we were waited on and while we were waited on, the waiter brought the first course which was very good Indian food. And I was sitting next to the Minister who had said ‘well how does this happen’. So, I turned to him and I said, "Well, did you experience very much when Shri Mataji was demonstrating how it works?" And he said, "Well, I just feel hot. I mean, all I can feel is hot. And I feel a bit strange". So, I put my hand over his head and there was a lot of cool air coming out and I said, "Can you feel this cool air?" And he said, "No, I just feel hot". And Shri Mataji saw me with my hand over this, over this Minister. So, She said, "Bring him to me. Bring him to me. So, he went up to the end of the table". This was, I have to say, in an expensive Indian restaurant at lunchtime in Moscow.
[Laughter]

And there were businessmen having business meetings and people eating Indian food and sort of going on, as presumably they normally do. And there was this Minister kneeling at Shri Mataji's feet. And She was hitting him on the shoulder saying, "It's your Vishuddhi. It'll work out. It'll work out".
[Laughter]

And the lunch was one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen. Because we sat at this long table, in a very pleasant Indian restaurant, and we were waited on and while we were waited on, the waiter brought the first course which was very good Indian food. And I was sitting next to the Minister who had said ‘well how does this happen’. So, I turned to him and I said, “Well, did you experience very much when Shri Mataji was demonstrating how it works? And he said, "Well I just feel hot. I mean, all I can feel is hot. And I feel a bit strange". So, I put my hand over his head and there was a lot of cool air coming out and I said, "Can you feel this cool air?" And he said, "No, I just feel hot". And Shri Mataji saw me with my hand over this, over this Minister. So, She said, "Bring him to me. Bring him to me". So, he went up to the end of the table. This was, I have to say, in an expensive Indian restaurant at lunchtime in Moscow.
[Laughter]

So, we then went to the Ministry of Health which was something that Yogi Mahajan had arranged. And the Ministry of Health is actually quite a splendid place, it makes my office look like a slum. My office is actually a slum. But the hall has marble walls and a marble hallway, and we went into this-
Shri Mataji: And marble pillar.
Sahaja Yogi: And marble pillars. And a wonderful atrium with a beautiful lamp in it. It really is a splendid place that looks like a museum. And we went into a conference room, with a long table. I think there were about 10 people in the room. And the professor of psychiatry was a leading member of the Ministry of Health. And he asked Shri Mataji to sit in the middle of the table. And he sat opposite. And then we all sat on various sides.

And he opened the conversation by being very polite and saying how pleasant it was that Shri Mataji had come to explain Sahaja Yoga. And he suggested that there is an association already within the Ministry of Health –
Shri Mataji: And we have to be one in it [unsure].
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. But he - what I understood he said was that Sahaja Yoga should become part of an association that exists, that has acupuncture and homeopathy and other types of yoga. And while he was saying this, Shri Mataji sat up at the table and she said, "No, there's no point in bringing me people who've had acupuncture. I can't raise their Kundalini. There's no point in bringing me people who've been to false gurus, it's no good. There's no point in bringing me people who've had various types of medicine, whether it's real medicine. If somebody's having renal dialysis, I can't raise their Kundalini. Sahaja Yoga has to be independent".
And this professor who was sitting next to me was slightly taken aback. Because he'd made what he presumed to be a very generous gesture. And Shri Mataji was saying, "No, this isn't good enough, Sahaja Yoga has to be completely independent of all these other alternative forms of medicine". And so the conversation continued and I must say, I didn't say a word. I just sat there and I watched Shri Mataji who became again very playful she was laughing and saying, "There's just no point, you know. It doesn't make any sense. Of course, Sahaja Yoga has to be independent, it's a unique thing. This is the root of how people get well this is the root of how people avoid having disease".
Shri Mataji: And there's no money involved.
Sahaja Yogi: And there's no money involved. I'm sorry, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: And it was extraordinary to watch this situation. Because it started off as a fairly formal business meeting with people: we had a reporter, we had a lady who was translating. Oleg was translating. There was another lady taking notes. And Yogi Mahajan, who had met these people and set up the meeting, was being quite formal. And Shri Mataji just turned this meeting into to a joyful occasion in which this chap, who wasn't quite sure what to say when She'd said ‘no it must be independent’, was completely won over. And after, he'd actually had quite a profound experience that morning when Shri Mataji had given Realization. And the outcome was that he absolutely agreed that Sahaja Yoga should be its own independent association within the Ministry of Health, which is actually, quite a historic, it's not only quite a historic, it's a major historic event. Because at the moment, Yogi Mahajan is still in Moscow and he's drawing up the protocol drawing up the paperwork which will be signed by both parties.

And we really left the meeting feeling that, you know, a major bit of work had been achieved. And the meeting lasted about an hour and a half two hours. And I don't know what's going to appear in the press, but there were a number of journalists who were present at both the meetings. One of the journalists asked if she could come to the afternoon meeting. And she arrived, having had the experience with Shri Mataji, and she arrived in this conference room and presented Shri Mataji with a bouquet. Now I don't know what they're going to write. I don't know what the outcome is going to be of all the contracts that need to be drawn up, all the protocols that need to be addressed, but I was very aware, and Dr Bogdan and I were very aware, that something very, very important had happened. Because we were actually dealing with top people in a country where it's not a democracy. And as soon as the top people agree that a particular association needs to be developed, needs to be involved within a particular Ministry, then this feeds down very rapidly.
So, it does seem that Sahaja Yoga has actually struck at a very important time, in a country where their thinking is changing, where Gorbachev is actually causing huge changes in the thinking of the individuals there. And it was a tremendous privilege to be present and it was also a tremendous joy.
Jai Shri Mataji.
[Applause]

[1:12:12 Shri Mataji is talking just after this long speech, comment 2]
Shri Mataji: I have to say one more thing, that I felt that Russian people are very pragmatic. And those bureaucrats, I’ve never come across such bureaucrats, nor such people in the medical top hierarchy to be that wise, it’s such wise people. Democratic countries think no end of themselves, but I think they lack wisdom and pragmatism. One sentence that gentleman said was very remarkable, this gentleman who was the head of the medical. He said, "I can see clearly, it is something great and these things happen in thousands of years. And I am not going to miss this opportunity". I can’t think, anywhere, in all these so-called democratic countries, anywhere, even in India, a person of that level could see the point so clearly. So, I think we should give them a hand, to those Russians.

[Shri Mataji applauses]
1:13:37

[1:43:59 Shri Mataji is talking, comment 3]
Shri Mataji: Now it is going to be 3:35. So, I think now, for tomorrow’s puja, we should now spare ourselves. You have all enjoyed it so much, isn’t it? This is Ganesha’s joy and his dancing. Beautiful it was. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi with Babamama]
Thank you very much.
Sahaja Yogis together: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Such a beautiful expression of joy! Spontaneously the whole thing worked out. You all have enjoyed?
Sahaja Yogis together: Yes, Shri Mataji.
We'll have tomorrow the puja about 12:00, I think, we start again. And tomorrow is an important day, because it’s a Ganesha Puja. I think Ganesha in you was dancing, in all of you and enjoyed it. It's great. Thank you very much.
[Hindi conversation]
Now sitting down, if you want, you can sing one song, last one.
[Applause]
He Adi Ma.
Babamama: He Adi Ma.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi with Babamama]
Babamama: Ok you, Jose.
Shri Mataji: All of you put together should sing.
Babamama: You follow us.
Jose: Ah, OK.
1:46:17

[1:51:54]
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
May God bless you all.
Thank you very much.
[1:52:00]
