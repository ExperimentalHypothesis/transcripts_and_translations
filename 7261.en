TV Interview. Istanbul (Turkey), 01 April 2000

77 years old  and the leader of a teaching called Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi came to Turkey to distribute the joy and happiness inside of Her. Shri Mataji gives conferences in every part of the world and her disciples; she called them as my children, they do not depart from Her even for a moment. Shri Mataji has millions of disciples in all parts of the world. These disciples say that they have found love and happiness in their Teacher’s energy. They do not complain at all, that they travel country to country by following Her. Shri Mataji’s name means Holy Mother and Her room at Swiss Hotel was flooded by enthusiasts who sought for self-realization sessions. Shri Mataji says that the main point is to raise the light within us which is called as Kundalini.

I am rising his Kundalini now.

Shri Mataji does not leave the Star TV correspondent also far from the benefit of this light. She says that Her main message is love.

Shri Mataji: I wouldn’t call them as students, they are my children. There is no relation as such, I just give them Love, that’s all, like a Mother.

Correspondent: Love?

Shri Mataji: Love, compassion and love.

For correspondent, Shri Mataji said, She thinks too much.

Amongst the İndian tunes, the disciples who are relaxed due to the hands and deep glance of Holy Mother, departed from there in peace and with gratitude.

Shri Mataji: (Raise you hands) Higher.
