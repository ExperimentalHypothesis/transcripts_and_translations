(France)

Indians are ancient people, they travelled all over the world. They went to, even to England. 
[Inaudible]
But the best part in the [Inaudible]
Six hours difference. And this six hours difference come in with the exact timing in India and there. And another I will tell you, the way they give degrees to the studies, bachelor of arts. “Apne a brahmachary tatva”, masters of arts, Brahmins. 
These are the things of ancient times, guru [?]
Sahaja Yogi (Dr Rustum Burjolee): Like laureates. 
Shri Mataji: You are surprising Me. Even in, near Peru or somewhere, there are mountains called Shiva, Vishnu.
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know Shri Mataji.

Another Sahaja Yogi (Arnaud): Even in Bolivia. 
Shri Mataji: Bolivia, what do you have?
Another Sahaja Yogi: In Bolivia there are some ruins, Shri Mataji, which is unexplained and they think that the people came from a very far away country to built this ruin. And it was a city in the Altiplano. 
Shri Mataji: What is it big? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: It was all the city. It’s not the Maya it’s a city which is quite close to La Paz. Tiwanaku. 
Shri Mataji: Best part of it, I’ll tell you, is that we went down to Bogota. And what is that port? In Bogota?
Sahaja Yogi: Cartafel? 
Shri Mataji: Hum, Cartafel. So we went there and they were having a party, reception party. So I asked them: “Why do you have a condor, Garuda, as your emblem for name, why do you have a condor?” So one fellow- still they have some aboriginal people there, quite a lot.  He told Me that: “Our forefathers told us that Shri Vishnu came from your country on a condor.” Now C.P. might say: “Go to a stand”, you know, I don’t know [unsure]. Really they told. And amazing he was; and then I made a little mistake, in a way. They said: “Mother these Americans are just torturing us and troubling us so much and they are taking our wheat at a very low price and we don’t make any profit. We don’t know how to exist in Bogota. So can you bless us with something that we can also exploit them? And they got the cocaine. My Goodness!  
Sahaja Yogi: But maybe that was not your blessing Shri Mataji. 
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, I’d rather say. [Laughter]
It’s a destructive force of that thing.
Sahaja Yogi: But actually, Shri Mataji, in the old days, in the 19 century, Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine. 
Shri Mataji: I know, I know. 
Sahaja Yogi: And the women used to drink it and it didn’t harm them. 
Shri Mataji: I don’t know but I could never take Coca-Cola once upon a time. 
Never could touch it. Then somebody said that now: “You‘ll like it.” I said: “Why?” He said: “There was cocaine in it before.” So I said:” All right, I taste. Now I can drink it. 
[Inaudible] doesn’t harm because this – because we have got this "avidya" now. It doesn’t harm these people because it is very cold and they eat it and they feel alright. 
Sahaja Yogi: This is right. 
Shri Mataji: It’s adjustable. 
Sahaja Yogi: But they eat the leaves.  
Shri Mataji: Then they can adjust themselves to this climate. Not meant for Americans. 
[Laughter]
What ever goes in one country, like if you go to the Himalayas, there’s one yak, it’s a big animal, it’s very big what you call, hair. Now if you make a coat of that and give it to a South Indian, what will happen to him.
[Laughter]

So, so this "Kaaba", Kaaba [Black stone in Mecca]. 
Now we should try to understand this Kaaba. Now, if it is Makeshwar Shiva, if it is Shiva, then sooner or later, we’ll reach it by the end of their wanting road as he enlightens the road, those who do not even believe in the uniqueness of God. Uniqueness of God.
Sahaja Yogi: What he is trying to say Shri Mataji- 
Shri Mataji: It’s time to say that those who believe 
Sahaja Yogi: In one God. 
Shri Mataji: In one God,
Sahaja Yogi: Monotheist, yes. 
Shri Mataji: They will reach first, is not possible.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s not that they will reach first, but that they will all reach.
Shri Mataji: No, no, ultimately, they will all reach. But those who claim themselves as monotheist are indeed like government that are equipping their own ways and through different path. This is a wrong idea. 
Sahaja Yogi: The idea that it is inevitable. 
Shri Mataji: For two things, you see, most important thing for a religious life is "zila" character, "zila" [or śīla], means morality, which is preached by Buddha, is that at first you must have a pure character. Those people who follow widely one God, openly, are these three [religions]. What they lack is morality. Though they will be the last to reach, to be very frank, unless and until they get transformation. Because, say, I'm saying it today, you can find out also, there are too genes which are protective in us, which have got protection against the sin against the Mother and sin against the Father, so they protect us. And, say, India, Indians have these still intact not to most of Indians but I am just saying dharmanga [whose body is the law]. But otherwise, these genes have gone into mutations everywhere. So they are immoral, I mean Indian’ego take, I think, ten thousands years to take to something nonsensical, like this, their child abuse.  
Sahaja Yogi: This is unbelievable.
Shri Mataji: I mean you can’t think [inaudible]
C.P. asks Me: “What do they do?” I say: “Do I know what do they do?”
[Laughter]
I don’t know what they do, and what is- as soon as you see the child, you develop a feeling of what’s Hell. 
Sahaja Yogi: You see what has happened now Shri Mataji, it has reached such a degree that even people who are innocent in their heart are afraid to hold children because someone will say they are abusing them.
You told us this story once about this woman in America who came to you and said she is afraid to kiss her own son. 
Shri Mataji:  Ha.
Sahaja Yogi: Small boy.
Shri Mataji: She would not even hug him and kiss him.
Sahaja Yogi: Because people would say-
Shri Mataji: But I can understand because you see there they follow Freud. But what about Muslims? And what about Jews? Jews follow Freud because he was Freud. But Muslims? They rape women they do all kind of violence why do they do it? But poor women how Muslim are maintaining. I don’t know how they live with men there. But at least they are dharmic. 

Sahaja Yogi: How did they, Shri Mataji, if they form very close relationships among themselves, the women. Yes and they protect each other. Once, I was in the hospital in Arabia Shri Mataji, in the women’s ward, and all the women were sitting, talking to each other and they were all laughing about their husband: “Oh he’s like this, this one is like this, he thinks he is like this” and they all have a party and they laugh at their husband and that’s how they protect themselves, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But they are doing this with their husband and their [inaudible]?
Sahaja Yogi: No, they just bare it, like. 
Shri Mataji: I don’t know if I told you my experience. I was once going to this place, what’s that, it’s a, that place was actually Daulatabad [Maharastra] where our car stopped. Daulatabad, Daulat, but little further on. I don’t know the way where we were going, Maswari or something. 
On the way it stopped where there was a little pipe of water. And I saw only Muslim ladies and children so poor, so poor. I mean in India, I’ve not seen such poor people as they were. And they were wearing all torned saris and children were all naked. Ameshwari is the name. And such a dirty, filthy appearance of everyone there. The hair was not washed or anything. 
So I got down and I had such feeling for them, and I got down and asked: “What the matter with you? Why are you living here? Why have you come all the way?” They said: “What we are living? We are just living like a beg gypsies here, all the women.”  “And who are these children?” They said: “A lady had eight children from one husband. Another lady who remarried had seven children. Another one has six children. All the children of this man are there. They say: “Talaq, talaq, talaq [repudiation]” And I said: “You didn’t get your "meher" [dower]? Meher was something, hundred rupees. What is it? And so many of them were there, I can’t understand such human tragedy. 
Sahaja Yogi: It’s very common there. 
Shri Mataji: They treat their women so badly.
Sahaja Yogi: And their children. And one of my patients was the son of one of their kings. And I asked him. And how did you get on with your father. He told me: “I never saw my father in my whole life.”
Shri Mataji: Why?
Sahaja Yogi: He just ignored his son, the father has no interest. He had produced the child, divorced the mother, marry someone else, produced a child, divorced- he would divorce before they gave birth to their children, he would never see his own children. 

Shri Mataji: This, I’ve seen Myself. So as he says that it’s not written in Koran that you ill treat your wife. And talaq, in between one talaq and another talaq, there should be some time.   
Sahaja Yogi: Also it is written Shri Mataji all the things that is allowed. 
Shri Mataji: He? 
Sahaja Yogi: It is written of all the things that is allowed to human beings. The one that God hates the most is divorce. 
Shri Mataji: Acha. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes it is written in the Koran. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: It’s an injustice. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. This divorce is only being used when it is impossible for a man and woman to stay together.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Or if there is a serious reason. 
But Mother, the women are responsible in a way for their status, because they are accepting anything and so the men are taking advantage of the thing. 
Sahaja Yogi: Actually Shri Mataji, the women are more conservative. In Omar, when I was teaching.
Shri Mataji: Hum, they are. 
Sahaja Yogi: The people who were against me were the women. Not all of them but some of them.
Shri Mataji: Now in Bangladesh, this new women have started and all the women have come up with the protest. But there are also some women who came out to say that: “You kill this writer who is spreading all these things.” But there, they had suspicion on a woman that she was having relation with another one, they buried her in the thing half way and hit her with stones and then, [inaudible] three cases like that. 
Sahaja Yogi: They kill them, they hit them with stones until they die. 
Shri Mataji: Now, what I am saying, these people talk of everything. They say that there is aggression of the- say, Hindus or the Christians or whatever.  About that they protest. But when in your own community such cruelty is going on, why don’t you talk against it? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: People are afraid to talk about that. 
Shri Mataji: What I am saying, they should talk that they are your mothers, they are your sisters, they are your daughters. 
Sahaja Yogi: But Shri Mataji, words don’t have the same meaning in those countries. A mother or a sister or a daughter is like a servant. She’s not important. She is there to be used, especially your sister or your daughter. She’s there to marry the man you want. She’s there to do what you tell her. There’s no relationship.
Shri Mataji: But not in Koran. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: No, it’s not. They are justifying that by Koran but in Koran it’s not said.
Shri Mataji: Where is the thing written. 
Sahaja Yogi: It’s not written. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: It’s not written but they say they pretend that Koran says that woman is inferior and they should submit to the man. 
Sahaja Yogi: But in the Koran it is written that a woman‘s brain is not as good as a man’s brain.  
Shri Mataji: But heart is better. 
But Muhammad Sahib used to listen to his wife, to his daughter. If it was so, why did he not kill his wife or his daughter any time? 
Sahaja Yogi: Muhammad Sahib was very attached to womanship.
The thing about him, Shri Mataji, is he was only active for about fifteen years.

Shri Mataji: There is one thing I’ll tell you. Now what difference I find, that, you see, in the South India, I mean, below the river Narmada, they respect their wives, they love their children, they love their daughters, women have a position. Because in Sanskrit is written: “Yatra naryastu pujyante tatra ramante devatah” “where the woman is respectable and respected, there remain the Gods.” But in the North, where there are Islamic rules, Punjab, Yupi [?], Bihar, Bengal, Polisap [?] , all these places you find is just like Muslim, not like Muslim it is impossible, but still. Position of women, is bad. But there are women who are, either will be dominating, or absolutely suppressed. Indira Gandhi comes from the same religion. So you can imagine. And also, normally I’ve seen now in my own family, in my husband’s family, women have no position as such. 
But the Hindu fought it so much that now they have equal rights in the property. When the daughter is married she is given the equal part of the thing. Every reform has been made in Hindu marriages. But nothing in the Islam because we are using the shariat in India.  Why should they? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: Because they are giving a religious significance to these rules. And so  they say: “You cannot change them.” You know, women will have half part of the heritage if there is a boy. Boy gets two parts and the woman one part. It’s always half of a man. Because they say it’s religious, you cannot change anything that is religious, which is completely stupid. 
Shri Mataji: Is it in Koran to give half? 
Another Sahaja Yogi: Oh yes, yes. Men are not, have the double of a sister for example. 
Shri Mataji: Now what I am trying to tell you that in India, stupid ladies, Neru dynasty, accepted the Muslim laws for India, for the Muslims. You see, it’s nowhere, in India, if you are there, you have to follow English, whether your are Muslim, Hindu, Christian.  
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, here Shri Mataji, even in Pakistan, by law, you cannot marry more than one wife. 
Shri Mataji: By law?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. 
Shri Mataji: Really? 
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what they told me. I asked one Pakistanis, I said why- 
Shri Mataji: They marry. 
Sahaja Yogi: They marry, yes. 

Shri Mataji: Now one thing is their part, you see, we should go to the practice of the religion. In the practice of the religion, what happens? That- I’ll give you the one example very important; I was once coming from Ryad to London in a Ryad Air aeroplane. And I went off to sleep, you see. When I got up, I saw very smart men with the Burda and this and that, smockings, and the women dressed up in half skirts. I said: “Where did we stop?” [Laughter] 
I tell you, I asked the lady: “Where did we stop in between, airport?” She said: “Nowhere” “We didn’t stop anywhere? Then how these people have come?” “You see, they are the same.” [Laughter]
So that means all this force doesn’t create any change but hypocrisy. 

Sahaja Yogi: I used to see it Shri Mataji when I used to fly. Just after the plane would take off or just before it came to land, there would be a big rush to the toilette to change the clothes. 
Shri Mataji: Apart from that, if you happen to see the way they drink, ??. Drink like Hell in England. 
Sahaja Yogi: Like a fish, Shri Mataji. Not only in England, in their own country. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogi: Even in Oman, alcoholism is very common. 
Another Sahaja Yogi: In a private. 
Sahaja Yogi: In a private circle. When people used to visit me, the first thing they’d say: “Do you have any alcohol?”
Shri Mataji: So, what this gentleman can do is to divert the attention of the fundamentalists to their own force by putting Koran at the top and Muhammad Sahib on the top and showing what are we doing? Just by spreading Islam, you’re not going to get the real people. 
If he could have that much courage I’ll give him marks. 
Sahaja Yogi: But even that, Shri Mataji, they can kill him for. 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. 
Sahaja Yogi: You don’t know these people. Look at Salman Rushde, he just wrote some silly book and they want to kill him. 
Shri Mataji: I think he too is- I gave him Realization 
Sahaja Yogi: Salman Rushde, he came to see You. 
Shri Mataji: Salman Rushde! God bless one. I don’t like him because he said against Muhammad Sahib. That I can’t bear. Who is he to talk of Muhammad Sahib? What does he know about spirituality? On that point, I will not give him any marks. Whatever is happening is good for him. But I don’t think that somebody should kill somebody for that. But in India, they write so much against Rama, Krishna, this, that, about everybody about Christ also they write.
