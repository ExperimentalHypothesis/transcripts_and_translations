So first of all, I wish you all a vey happy Diwali and a prosporous whole year, after this New year day. 
[Applause]
The whole program, I must say, was overwhelmingly joyous and happy and such beautiful words have been said about enlightenment. You don't know how happy I feel to see you all develop your enlightenment into such a joyful establissment of a, absolutely, a new generation of people. 

Tomorrow of course, I'll tell you about Greece and about Adi Shakti. But today's program, one after another, started expressing your higher awareness in everything. Of course, to begin with, we had very good groups from Benin and â€“ who I have seen there?
Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast. 
Shri Mataji: Hum? 
Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast. 
Shri Mataji: Ah!
I always, I don't know why, I forget this name  "Ivory Coast". I've been there, once, I've been there. And somehow,  Ivory Coast, I don't know why, it makes me feel that it is a place where people are like Ivory and their hearts are shining and glimmering with the hope for Me and for the whole world at large. I'm so overwhelmed that I don't know what to say about everything. 

Then, the dramas that you had, the first one was so touching and so much realistic and the feelings that you have for India also made Me really crying with joy. 
I never expected that the sacrifices of these great men of India would be one day recognized and resounded in such a beautful maner. Every Indian will be so enamored when they will see these renderings of different people  and of this great, very, very great people. 

And also, I love to hear about Abraham Lincoln. I know about him very much because I've read a lot. I never had a chance to meet him. I think, much before my birth he was not there.  This is alright but in thoughts and in his work, a greatness of a great soul is shown. And such people are never lost to the world. 
There have been so many great people in this world, so many great, so many enlightened people. And their lives, if you want to depict, you won't know how they have become so great. Unfortunately, they had no Mother to guide them, to save them, to protect them: that's what they thought, but it's not so. Because all these great people are always protected, always given encouragement. Because this is what is very much needed for their life.

The Greek Collective has done this program in such a short time and shows there, very, very old traditional authority in organizing things and working out things with a minimum of minimum.

Also their music was very enchanting. I wish we had some more of that, because it is the mixture of the Western and Eastern music. And so many Greeks who went with,  I should say, a great warrior Alexander, stayed back in India. And they still sing songs like this. And their styles are the same and they make terracotta. And I am selling that terracotta all over the world because they're in a very miserable state. Perhaps, they have not much clothes to wear and they live on the trees.
But now it's better, much better.
These people came to India and they wouldn't return with Alexander and they settled down.

And when they were asked: "Why do you want to live with this miserable condition?" They said: "There is peace in this country." There is peace. There is light in this country. We want to live there. What do I, [unsure] we need all the materialistic things? We are very peaceful. We are very happy people and we are making very simple things. 

I was surprised how these Greeks have become so much detached from all the worldly pleasures that they could have here, and that they never felt that they were sacrificing anything or getting detached.
