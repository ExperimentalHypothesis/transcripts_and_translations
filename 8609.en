[Note: Here the dotted lines are depicting the Sanskrit phrase]

So when the Gods are fighting because you are present they were so emboldened by your presence that they create this big Noise and all this brings terror and astonishment in the heart of their enemies. And you keep all of these gods in the state of excitement and you proceed to battle showing great anger on your face and lift your arms which holds the deadly weapons (all the weapons are deadly weapons in the hand of the goddess to strike the demons)

Shri Mataji: This is only the one side of the goddess... you see ...

Sahaja yogi: And this is again one more of the goddesses on the battlefield and you can see it .....

Shri Mataji: This is the description of the Mahishasura's killing and that's why it is more than how she kills the demons to protect her children from the invading evil this is why more of her warrior-like capacities are described ...

Sahaja Yogi: This is for another 3 overs after that it's the description of the Goddess as the mother and Ocean of Compassion.

So...
When you by your own powers simply say "Hun" that itself makes great volumes of smoke and bright light emanate from your mouth and these 2 demons" dhruma & vilochan " They just got completely [unclear 01:51 /emulated]
"Shonit beej" is same as Rakt beej and in the battlefield, you sucked out the blood of the terrible demon and whenever any drops fells of this demon on the earth from your mouth more such "rakt beejas "came up...
So this means that these demons are the "rakt beejas" and "shumbh nishumbh " who are the other demons you kill them all and on their blood all these ghost and ghouls that go round lord shiva saying shiva they have a big feast of that blood. So You as the mother of Compassion you even look after these ghosts and ghouls because they say the name of Lord Shiva... 

This means that on the battlefield, Dhanur is your bow and your arms are moving so much together. You are so absorbed that your arm is moving continuously shooting arrows at the enemies & yet your whole body is moving as if you are dancing and your anklets I mean your bracelets are going "Natak katake " so they are also making a musical sound ...So the Goddess, even though she is fighting the demons she is doing it with such grace and beauty.

You who destroyed this demon "Vatuk ''(is a demon ) from your arrows in the battlefields flashes of gold and yellow and light come out and sounds which are very pleasing to the ear...

Here "batuk" is bhairava and the Gods are also filled with great enthusiasm and they see you fighting and they are fighting beside you that the quivers on their backs shine forth with new colours and seeing all this Lord Bhairava who is dancing in front of you starts dancing in great ecstasy. And I am sure he must be saying -Jai Mataji, Jai Mataji!

So when we say your name and say it again and again then we come into great meditation, and then there is no need of any more sounds or language and immediately we come and {unclear prostate } for ourself before you, You who is the queen of the whole universe Or who you bring to the salvation to the whole universe.

"Bhoot pate" is the lord of the "bhootas" ie-Lord Shiva ...& when he hears your ornaments which is "nupura" making the sounds like "Bhan Bhan Bhinjimi Binkriti " He who is beyond sound but when he hears this he leaves his own meditation & he wants to hear that sound again and again.

So, Once you take the form of a great goddess of Shri Ardha Narishwara( half Shiva, half Shri Parvati ) & when you dance in the company of other dancers including Lord Shiva who is supposed to be the Lord of the cosmic Dance your dance puts them all to shame ...And when you dance your divine dance the greatest musicians and singers accompany you ...There is something for you ...

Shri Mataji: Word "suman" ...
So "suman" could mean the one who has the beautiful mana (The mind)
or "suman" is also a flower(like also a soft beautiful flower ) or "suman" is also the combined form of Shri Parvati and Lord Shiva and "suman" also means that your whole being your form is so beautiful ...
And " sumanohar "...And seeing all this you make our mind who are your devotees absolutely pure and beautiful ...And "Kanti yutey" all kinds of light emanate from you because you are totally fulgent.
This we have seen 

[Shrit Rajni ..............................................................].
Shrit Rajni is the night ...Rajni here means night or darkness ...The darkness takes refuge in you because you are the light, the darkness dissolves in you. Rajni also means that you are very beautiful, Rajni means also the one whose arti we do ...Ra+ajni also means the one who has no birth who is totally eternal ...and Rajni is also a lotus and colours in the hands so you hold lotus in your hand ..." Vakravitay'' your noble face shines like a full moon

[Sunayana rabhram.........................]
Even the,..."Bhramara" actually means the black bees ...So, many times this black bees also have been her ganas and ...
Shri Mataji: No no, ganas can be made into "Bhramaras "
Sahajyogi: The goddesses' ganas have been made into black bees and have been sent to destroy... And her name is also "Bhramramba"
And also black bees because the bhramara means the black bees are the ones that pollinate (goes from flower to flower ) so they are the ones who gave the realisation from person to person giving them power ...Then the sound of the "bhramranda" The buzzing of the bees is like the sound of the Kundalini rising in the Sushumna Nadi ...And the bhramara also When the clusters of the Bhramara when we see...Sunayana means the beautiful eyes ...and vibramhara there ...It means that your dark eyebrows are like clusters of black bees and she is also "brahmaradi patey " because as I mentioned earlier that by moving her eyebrows up and down the three lines on her forehead are the 3 worlds themselves and she creates and dissolves these worlds simply by moving her "brahma randra"...

Sahit mahlav mall matalik......................
This I will I think hand over the mike with your permission to Shri Mataji :
Shri Mataji: I mean I can't praise myself ...
You better read this ...
Mallas are the great wrestlers who fight with their own arms they don't use any weapons so, these mallas come into the battlefield This is in the first line ...and You battle with them in the same ways that they fight and you tire them out and you become totally absorbed in the battle and you plan to fight them in the same way and they are ....they have been harassing the bheel tribes ...Bheels are the "adivasis" (the aboriginals who lives in the forest) So, Whole Bheel-tribes have been harassed by these mallas but you fight with them and destroy them and Bheel -tribals are very happy that you are doing this ...Then continuing of the forests similes it says that your actions are so beautiful like ..."Sal lalitey " is also that you have done all this with great fine art ...and you see the rising of the sun...the rays of the sun in the morning as it rises ie -"sitarun" or the "Tallaj pallav " would mean the trees and the leaves of the forests as well and all this ...The "sita krita" is where you have your own actions are such that you have completely cooled us or they created the cool shiver of the Goosebumps you feel...
Shri Mataji: With the cooling, they get the shivers...And its a poetry you see ...that all these ...I am always worried about aboriginals ...you must have heard many a times saying that what this praise did and why did they try like that and I am always concerned because they are "adijana" ...They are the primordial people & they have been ruined by so many peoples so, that's what they are saying that when she kills those demons who have troubled these "bhills" means the people who live in the jungles than all the leaves and all the trees are vibrated by her joy and they shine that's what it is ...

Sahaja yogi :
[Avind..........................................]
So, here "gajraj patey" is again the lord of all the king of the elephants rather the king elephant himself ...Dignity with which he carries himself and the way he holds his neck and his movement and also that his throat is filled with nectar and this means that the goddess ...your neck is lifted up like that the King of elephants with dignity and prestige ...Your carriage is very regal ... And your speech is like...Is filled with nectar.

[Tribhuvan .......................................]

So, You are the ornament of all the 3 worlds. That is, you are the most beautiful, shining ornament or jewel of the ...It's difficult to do an exact translation into English...
That which brings the beauty the Bhushan is that brings to the glory, so, "Bhut kala nidhhi " ...You are that ocean of various arts of creation and you are" roop payonidhi " that means you are the ocean of beauty ...
"Rajsutey "... you are the daughter of the king or you are a great princess

Shri Mataji: It means... Ocean of many forms.

Sahaja yogi: "Roop payonidhi " is the ocean of many forms, each one more beautiful than the other...

So, the children of "Dhriti " (the children of demons ) by your many forms and by your beauty they become pure and the baser self is not excited but they become the people with pure minds So those who are not good you can make them completely pure ...

As in today's drama, Shri Mataji mentioned it to us.

[Kamal dalamal........................]
So Kamal is a lotus, dalamal is a cluster of lotuses Komal Kanti means from these lotuses you make them emit the beautiful, gentle kind of light and you have the art or you have the power to make them blossom and when they do that you take these lotuses and put them in your hair means that by your own power of desire you can make the Sahasrara lotuses blossom and when they do these clusters of pure lotuses then illuminate the beautiful light of self-realisation.

[Sakal Vilas Kala ...............]

So, the swan can discriminate between the milk and water or discriminate between good and evil these heavenly swans are around you and when they recognise your great work which brings a joy, they get filled with joy and they move around in an excited manner ...This is also your connection as it is ...Because you are Shri Saraswati and you are at the Shri Hamsa chakra is the one you open up ...
[Alikul sankul ..........................................]
So, clusters of bees as they are attracted to groups of flowers the same way the stars and all the planets...They are attracted and they come and take the abode on your forehead ...
Now, this is also the tribals and the forest's description of the Goddess there...

[Karmurli Rava ........................................]
"Manjumatey "-It means you are very mild or intelligent and is music personified ...So Your intelligence is total as music personified and when you in your hand take the "murli" ( which is the flute )even the whole forest is filled with that beautiful sound and even the nightingale is put to shame

[Milit .............................................................]

"Milit Pujit " Means you are very being around us gives that static feeling which we know we feel in all our hairs strands and on ends on we get goose pimples the same way this name gives the "Manohar gunjit "..."Gunjit" is the sound of Bees Buzzing ...So you have the beautiful sound very pleasing to the mind of the bees buzzing which is rising of the kundalini & you who lives on the mountains on the "Shaila " ...You make the whole mountain very excited "Ranjit " ecstatic that all the shrubs (in the same simile that hair on your handstands up ... same with the shrubs get vibrated and blossoming ....)

Shri Mataji: Hair on the mountain ...You are sitting on the mountain The mountain feels so happy because you are there ...Mountains are so happy so the hair stands on their ends means they have become "pulkit " and when they get that feeling also the shrubs which are the hair in the body of the mountain have also...They also become 'pulkit'.
"Pulit " is a Sanskrit word or Marathi also we have mean when you are filled with feeling this means how your whole body starts getting these beautiful feeling of hair raising (is not a good word )
(again line in Sanskrit) ...............................

So here,
Shri Mataji: On the mountains, there are these aboriginal women who have got their original good character and original and very natural life ...They are very natural ones you see... and so when they get these shrubs being vibrated they also get into a very playful mood. It is to make them happy ...Because they are living in the jungles... nature ...

Sahaj yogi: Now we have the form of the goddess when we have done her puja ...and we are ready for her darshan So,.................................................

So "chandra ruchey" is one 21:03 who is fond of the moon ...You are the one who is fond of the moon because of the spirit...Or Also moon because you are Shri Shivani so you have moon in your [unclear].You wear cloth...yellow cloth around your waist emanate multi cloured lights even put the peacock to same ...And they are so brilliant about the clothes that you wear. In the next line, is the multitude of gods and demons all of them prostrate themselves at your lotus feet and that many jewels of the crown give off very brilliant lights...But the light emitting from your toenails is so great that those light from the jewels is not even the smallest particle of the light from toenails ...And the next line is translated that your entire front when we decorate the goddess is covered with gold ornaments. And the garlands reach down to your feet and they worship your feet making it more beautiful and your entire form is ...
Shri Mataji: ...is that you feel as if you are absolutely secured ...You look like as if there is -You are standing without support absolutely equanimity.

[Sahaja yogi : [sanskrit phrase]...............................]
