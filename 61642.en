Shri Mataji: .... poor line all that. which is has got regular very artistic

Yogi: But this Shri Mataji it is also very freshen again in Europe. We are going back with the two handles with old style...

Shri Mataji: Because they are not so complicated.

Yogi: Yes, we can easily very pears

Shri Mataji: That’s why I thought the two things that can be declared and also I think I unclear() they have eternal values.

Yogi: Could be sign

Shri Mataji: Then of course people are saying unclear(you look/you should) very modern by., you see in modern I don’t mind. You must have some unclear(character/talent) in it.

Yogi: Easier to just...

Shri Mataji: and also, its Brass. It is natural Brass. Indians are becoming very, very superstitious. Very superstitious. Plastic so expensive, everything so expensive. I don’t know they lose it completely unclear(when) the way you people are moved in your industrial revolution as if you have lost unclear() and Indians are so concerned about that. That’s why I was telling the management that to start one new operation. Then you ask to do Indian art, Indian craft. Once it is lost, it is lost. Now in Germany, crafts and handmade must be very expensive. Because everybody labor is expensive, and they would lost that.

Yogi: Yest Shri Mataji, everything single thing which is handmade Shri Mataji its very expensive.

Shri Mataji: See that is also unclear() it has something to do which prohibited, has, unclear(they says) vibrations it has. Which has vibrations. which can retain vibrations. You can’t give vibrations to a aluminum. But to brass you can. Unclear(not to wood), plastic, plastic you can’t, plastic can’t absorb minimum. It won’t retain vibrations.

Yogi: Do you think Shri Mataji, all these things also go out that we were losing again?

Shri Mataji: We will have to. Because if you use too much plastic, will get sick.

Yogi: and they will like it Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: They will like. You know, you learn to use plastic thing maybe you like it because it’s easy to usage. But after some time, they will develop diseases. The women who wear nylon saree develop diseases. But they will wear nylon instead of silk or cotton. Cotton and Silk are not cheaper in India. They don’t like cotton. Even this is the wear nylon. But mine is all the time unclear() to wear nylon then you develop some sort of a skin problems with shoes and everything. Because it is anti-body. I mean the anti-bodies growth.

Yogi: Against the nature.

Shri Mataji: In foods also, you put all artificial chemicals this that. The whole thing is on destruction. Machinery is all right till it is for construction. But once it starts destroying people. Sahaja yoga is just of the other way round. I didn’t tell you about my land. They told me that nothing can grow in this land so don’t grow, I got rolled out rice 60 kilos of rice which is the best basmati rice. They said basmati cannot grow. When I sowed it in a part of it, very very little part of it for 60 kilos we got eighteen bags food. One bag is equals to 100 kilos. And very that become thinner better. Now these were not we didn’t use what you call them hybrid. Ordinary. Hybrid we didn’t use. If you use hybrid, it has no reproduction and you become a slave to some company – (seed) suppliers.

Yogi: unclear (for all these seeds.)

Shri Mataji: But now we can change it. The ordinary ones you can make them into good seeds.

Yogi: yes. the seeds are same like hybrids.

Shri Mataji: But as if this hybrid is unclear() plastic unclear(). It will go back. I am sure it will go back out of sudden.

Yogi: Let’s think so, Shri Mataji not just in sahaja yoga now many people are very conscious about buying things of which are (free of cost)

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: Yes, I mean unclear(for wood), unclear(those who can afford Shri Mataji look after this quality now)

Shri Mataji: You see they could have imported. But when then industrial dimension came in

they closed down all mills unclear(in London). All mills were closed everywhere. They would not produce any cotton. Because there were not producing cotton, we were the ones who produce cotton, cotton wood. we could not sell it. So, all our work: agricultural work as well as cotton works were stopped. So, they are producing out of that sugar cane. If you had kept your machines working, you could have got raw material from us. Actually, my father had lots of unclear(people). Unclear But he was such a, really became such a patriotic man, joined Congress and sacrificed, we were lost all the lands, asserts. Also, they were ceiling in India over land owning. Will you have ceiling here on land? For forming land?

Yogi: What does this means?

Shri Mataji: Ceiling means up to a point you can buy. So many acres

Yogi: No no

Shri Mataji: You can buy any

Yogi: If you are Austrian, you can buy if much money you have and you can get, no limitation.

Shri Mataji: A non-Austrian cannot.

Yogi: A non-Austrian cannot Shri Mataji, there is a limitation Shri Mataji. Foreigners cannot.

Shri Mataji: But a non-Austrian can buy a house here, here now.

Yogi: I am not sure, in certain areas not at all. In certain areas not, you have to do it through unclear()

Another Yogi: Really.

Yogi: Yes.

Another Yogi: I think in Germany you can. In Germany it’s possible that foreign people can buy a house(s).

Yogi: But this will change when we, of course and they call a market then its finished.

Shri Mataji: unclear()

Yogi: They are too conservative; they want now to join very soon. The socialists, they see the pros and cons unclear(of course also) But the consumer it was very good,

Shri Mataji: unclear(what/but) for the producer.

Yogi: For the producer we have still many areas where it’s quite protected,

Shri Mataji: for certain things you know.

Yogi: just take electronics, its thirty percent more expensive here than in Germany unclear(so why) Nobody knows for cars much more expensive here.

Shri Mataji: No, not at all, you see, German cars you buy here in England, they are so expensive. Those sell them like hot cakes.

Yogi: Just take that, I may say that Shri Mataji which is just produced in Germany unclear(BMW), we pay at least thirty percent more in Austria.

Shri Mataji: In Germany?

Yogi: It could be at the Germany.

Another Yogi: Its cheaper in Germany than in Austria.

Yogi: Its nice cheaper. They manage things.

Another Yogi: Because more taxes

Shri Mataji: But you don’t pay that money to them. Do you pay to them?

Yogi: No no no

Shri Mataji: To the customs

Yogi: It’s not with customs also the wholesalers and retailers. They earn more money. They are putting more money on it.

Shri Mataji: Really, unclear()?

Yogi: Ya, and customs of course, there is also customs sure, which they also go with the corn market, it’s also a path which increases the price definitely.

Shri Mataji: No but they will have a big turnover.

Yogi: Ya

Shri Mataji: They will sell much more.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, I believe here very much with if you don’t have to compete, you get weak. I mean a good economy is function when there is competition.

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Yogi: Ya because you have to unclear() you are not very protective. Because if you are not good, you will not unclear(compete).

Shri Mataji: Competition can also be a very dirty competition.

Another Yogi: Also, Shri Mataji, it leads to a dead end in the end. In the end where there is so much competition where everybody will be better and better and better with...

Yogi: But that is not possible, unclear(we will crash/crush)

Shri Mataji: For supposing, hello, supposing we have collective product, then there is no competition here.

Another Yogi: I think it would be much better.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, I would say with sahaja yogis it would be possible. But normally, in normal life, just take the government I mean they have the competition every single day the way it is twice expensive. Take the post service, in Austria the post is monoploid. It’s not in England. Overall post services are much more expensive than in England. Well, It’s the government business to take the garbage away. They made it charge a lot but still they are in the way.

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s true.

Yogi: Some villages with unclear(there is a lot) some private enterprises it’s the same amount they get from the community, they make the profit.

Shri Mataji: It’s true. I agree. That is why you see Gorbachev has decided to change that. But it has another dividend. Competition as he says because up to a point

Yogi: Yes, then it’s of worst

Shri Mataji: Then it is very wasteful, it’s very wasteful production. Like in England it’s not so much outside. If you go to America cars that are broken just kept them as like mountains. Bigger mountain than unclear(yuan/you) The plastic that they have wasted with such a lot that they don’t know what to do. They cannot burn it, they cannot sink it,

Another Yogi: They shoot it in to the unclear(cosmos) Shri Mataji, they spray into the space, they shoot it.

Shri Mataji: So, competition has its own dividends also. So much of wastage of, and then the unclear(equality/Ecology). They start digging your motherland. I think they are exhausted.

Yogi: Unclear(Till now)Shri Mataji, I think they get better understanding. Unclear() was another corporate of course now it’s very expensive for example to deposit plastic some where we have to pay money now. So, it’s also goes into production cost now cannot just through it, it’s not allowed.

Shri Mataji: But if you have a machinery see, if you have a machinery, to work it out, you have to produce it whether you like it or not.

Yogi: Sure.

Shri Mataji: If you do not put it into a balance. See once you put a machinery it goes on exhausting like a devil it goes on increasing you see, you will have to digging into the Mother Earth. Now that’s the problem you don’t have brass, you don’t have gold, you don’t have this, and you don’t have that. Because of progressing so much and wasting it. Like, in my house for suppose I put up a machine instead of people in the house, then for over production I will have to have consumption. If I don’t have the consumption, I waste it. Here I am exhausting out of proportion unclear() my income but apart from it has some other also very serious execution. Why you say America goes all the way to Koria and all these places? Because they want to sell them, so a kind of a you can say as a kind of an exploitation starts.

Yogi: The whole company policy was up to now at least is directed to its expansion. It’s very much through and now they have to learn because in many ..

Shri Mataji: But still the problem like, I would say, they say the Indians are very poor unclear(). But what is your esperance is lust. See every Indian movie you go, any unclear(bit of core) they will have some unclear(symbols) somebody will love. How many people have here?

Another Yogi: Sure, not many.

Shri Mataji: They will have say for example, we have say diamonds. Diamonds are they need not be first quality. They can be tenth quality; they can be twelfth quality we have ruby’s any quality. So, depending on the person, if you want to buy a ruby, anybody can buy. Not necessarily only the rich can buy. Because every quality is allowed, there is no standardization on that you see.

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: When you sell it, you get the price whatever is the level of that.

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: But this standardization they have to make for competitions. As a result of that a very few people can have anything. If you see an Indian home, if you go into any Indian home, ordinary – even a clerk’s house, the amount of brass he’ll have, the amount of silver he’ll have, the amount of gold he’ll have will be much more than quite a rich man. But he may have more plastic more glass may be rubber.

Yogi: Means Shri Mataji, most of us are investing on things we can show off to the outside very often Shri Mataji they because beginner say this unclear(we may not pay that every single on credit, when you come it a home they sit on ordinary wood chair. Because at home nobody sit but they go egoistical there is..)

Shri Mataji: see, too much showing off and also empty showing off.

Yogi: Yes, it’s stupid.

Shri Mataji: Another thing I have seen in these modern times is very sad- where we have lost is this that because of this competitive world people have become extremely busy and also the people busy with the work so much like they are tired very tired with the competition. So, there is so much tension. Now they come home, they can’t even talk to each other. They quarrel, fight. And after five days they go to some place to have a holiday. The house is just a bare necessity. It’s not a house. Very small small rooms. Just live there for five days and then you are out for somewhere.

Another Yogi: So, the dryness comes in, and everybody dries out completely.

Shri Mataji: Dries out. No no heart. You can’t talk to anyone lovingly; you cannot discuss anything like this they will never sit down and talk or have some unclear(record) nothing. Run run run run run for five days and then you go out. And the competition is so much that there is competition between husband wife also. You see unclear(), the competition is so much you see between husband and wife also.

Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That I was telling that in England, nothing sells. I must say you are the last unclear() on flowers. From where do you get all these flowers?

Yogini: They just come from by plane to me.

Shri Mataji: From where?

Yogini: Colombia and from Poland.

Another Yogi: Shri Mataji also I think everybody is completely manipulated because of this over production people have to buy what is produced. So, everybody has to buy what they is, due to advertisement also everybody has the same car, has same things, it’s very unclear(artificial).

Shri Mataji: And this fashion is also a part of the same competition. Fashion is also the part of the same competition.

Yogi: Yes yes, it’s one devils circle, is one circle.

Shri Mataji: So, go to some house, pile of clothes you know,

Yogi: Again those who unclear() outside, it’s always same Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: And also the busyness, unclear() They have no time to talk to anyone.

Yogi: And everybody is taking pills, everybody is taking drugs, everybody is taking medication.

Shri Mataji: Absolutely. Everybody is sick, such a competition unclear()

Yogi: Shri Mataji, we are seeing that the problems, I mean so many have problems or unclear() eyes?

Shri Mataji: So so many things.

Yogi: Unclear()

Shri Mataji: Nervousness, this that,

Another Yogi: Also, the Hamsa Shri Mataji, it is very much effected. The Hamsa is also very much affected.

Shri Mataji: Hamsa is very bad. Unclear() this Hamsa unclear().

In England the routine of a person I will tell you. He goes to work, doesn’t even brush his teeth at home. Goes in the office and brushes his teeth. Then he starts working.

Another Yogi: His breakfast on the bicycle Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: He comes home, doesn’t go to the home, because his wife is in the pub. They sit in the pub and quarrel, come home and sleep. It is common. Next day same thing. He sleeps in his jeans, takes out his jeans next day next day wears the jean and again back to office. Five days he does the same. Sixth day both of them are somewhere out, out of the town for another unclear() or camping. They start camping, and the camping such a headache. They can’t sleep on the ground; they take these cots this that everything. They cook I mean it’s such a headache you know unclear(). so how do they get their rest? I can understand if somebody is cooking for you, one looking after you, I mean something natural is there. There also same thing artificial. So, one should take over all view of everything. Machinery as for us we are not machinery have some machinery unclear(). This madness of materialism must go. What is materialism? It’s nothing, what we have is nothing but plastic plastic plastic plastic plastic. Have few things but good things of eternal life. Indians are becoming much worst. To them, now they are very poor, what is good is to have plastic. I have to take plastic for them-Nylons for Indian women.

Yogi: We have seen it Shri Mataji unclear(in India/an Indian) advertised pure plastic.

Shri Mataji: Yes, and cotton is expensive

Yogi: Next is cotton. Plastic is expensive and cotton is cheap.

Shri Mataji: Very expensive, cotton is much cheaper. It is much more expensive. There is not end to it, madness. How a man doesn’t have any balance?

Another Yogi: Shri Mataji, we could may be like this that human mankind have to go through this madness to then find the balance again.

Shri Mataji: I think so must be.

Another Yogi: Maybe they all have to go through it.

Shri Mataji: Or you can take the consolation like that. But one should be, Shri Mahatma Gandhi said that we should not take to machines much. He was not very much unclear(inclined/in favor). I think he was very right there. If you have to be affluent, see you should be really affluent. Not the way that you have plastics. The affluence is just psychological. And there is no heart at all as you, he said now you become dry.

Another Yogi: Also I think You mean mankind they have to learn through mistakes Shri Mataji. I think life has to teach them. Because they are not able to teach themselves. So, life has to teach them.

Shri Mataji: At least I used to believe that Indians are sensible, wise people. Now they too useless. They now want to learn through your mistakes. They want to know what mistakes you have done, they will all unclear() this that and..

..

Yogi: Poor Indians

Shri Mataji: And then they become Sahaja Yogis.

Yogi: I think Shri Mataji, they all have to go to the roots. It’s like a child. I mean the parents are telling the child I mean – you better do this now, the child has to make her own experiences. It looks like the same.

Shri Mataji: But our countries have known for obedience for the stuff., I was surprised to know that my granddaughter Sona, she said she wants to do medicine. Means she is such a sensitive child, she is a realized soul of course, she is a very sensitive child. She can’t even touch an ant. Leave alone unclear(). Cockroach mans a very big rakshasa for her. And they can’t see even a lizard in the house. Means the whole house goes into a chaos. Lizard, everybody say lizard. Now they can’t kill the lizard because they don’t want kill, they don’t want to have the lizard. So how is it? So, this is the situation and she wants to do biology. So, I called her, she said, yes that is true. I can’t touch anything, then I said why taking biology? So, I called my daughter. She said see Mother, these days children are not like the way we were. They do what they want to do. Because her friend is doing biology, that’s why she. And said she will fail. She said let her fail and understand. Unclear(She said will your children forced to listen to me/you). And we have made good out of our life(s). But with these children? I said just listen to them, she said they will. But let her learn in this. And in India, today we need doctors, we need to many doctors. We need lawyers. Horrible lawyers we have. So corrupted. And need good journalists in the whole world I should say we need.

Yogi: Yes, that’s very much true.

Shri Mataji: unclear(This mud briefing case), this fellow first said unclear(not/me) to just pay five thousand. He gave up to so far, I paid about thirteen thousand dollars that time, about ten thousand rupees. And he would not allow me to say that there was something sinister about this man that he deliberately beat out this case. He would not. I was wondering why he is not saying because it is so obvious. Now he is says you have to pay twenty-five thousand dollars more then only we can make the case of punitive damages. I wrote a very strong letter to him that I am not interested in money, I am only interested punitive damage and if you think that five thousand rupees, I spent to get some sort of a compensation for them then you are sadly mistaken. I want him to be punished that’s what my idea is and if you cannot do that, you better change your profession.

Yogi: This is a very good lesson. They just think about money Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: See but I self, he calls me Mother, both of them call me Mother, they came to India, they came to my birthday, I said, they written that, you see you don’t take any money for your work, you are not employed so how can you value the time part and all that. So, it’s a question of not valuing my time, it’s a question of the insult.

Yogi: Of course, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: I said at least there are somebody who doesn’t take money for work. What about you for a change. I gave them left and right. I said in any case what are they going to do? I said you better change your profession. Even now, I would say Indian lawyers are better than the American lawyers. They are not unclear(). I mean they know what is justice. Even doctors are better now. But soon they will become like this. Full competition. It’s a cutthroat competition among doctors. It is terrible. Now. That’s an idea as far as unclear().

Yogi: Shri Mataji would you like unclear() talk to Andria?

Shri Mataji: unclear() This candle is a miracle, unclear() one is from unclear() one is from Germany

Another Yogi: One is from Singapore.

Shri Mataji: If you don’t mind, I will just take it.

Another Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji of course.

Yogi: No no, unclear(we just served this), we don’t want you to starve Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: I must say, this unclear(streak) I have eaten so much. I never eaten so much of that unclear(). so many varieties even looking at it feels full. I am sure you all will enjoy. You people are really very balanced at compared to Indians. Indians don’t have so much balance. But you like the taste.

As soon as I go there today I have to sure think from unclear() the whole house painted, and the van is coming in the evening I have to go out. My son-in-law is coming tomorrow morning at around 5:30. More rest. Unclear()

Yogi: Unclear() brought it for you Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: Really? So sweet of her. I have so many but at the right time you don’t find it.
