I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very out set we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot conceptualise it, at this human state.

Whatever I want to tell you today, you are not to accept it blindfolded, but you should have an open mind of a scientist and if it works, then you have to accept, as honest people, because it is for the benevolence of every Individual and for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

These are special times when we are born. I call it as a blossom time, where many seekers of truth are born, but they have to know first of all, what is the truth.

First thing is that you are not this body, this mind, this intelligence, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure spirit.

The second truth is that there is a subtle, all-pervading power of divine love and this power does all the living work. We see these beautiful flowers and we take them for granted. We don’t even think that it’s a miracle, how from one seed these flowers have come, also who runs our heart.

Doctors will say autonomous nervous system, but who is this auto. We have science but it cannot give us answers fully. It cannot answer, why are we here on this earth. It cannot answer what is our purpose of life. It cannot tell you about totality.

So we take to religion. It’s very disappointing to see that all these great religions are only power oriented or money oriented, and they are not spirit oriented.

Every religion, every scripture has said that, you are to be born again. They have talked of your resurrection. Some people just brand themselves as born again but they are not. They are just like us. Any religion, now for example Catholic religion we can take. It is absolutely unnatural to make nuns and priests who cannot marry. That’s why there are problems. There are priests, there are nuns, but they are having women and the nuns are becoming pregnant.

It is also true that when we are not connected with this all-pervading power we are slaves of all sorts of ideologies. An entrepreneur can enslave us, see for example he starts very tight pants, so every body loses his personality, his identity and starts wearing the same. Till, they develop varicose veins.

Also the new styles every year coming up from Paris. Now in England to wear six inches of skirts is absolutely dangerous, but we accept it, because we have to be in. All of us lose our identity and we start taking to some sort of a idea which is just put through medias to us.

So in the democratic countries the freedom that is given to us really makes us slaves. Now the worst is America, they also produce some sort of a stupid idea. For example, recently now they are celebrating the birthday of dogs, if that is not so now they have teddy bears which have got birth dates, and very seriously they believe in it.

Such idiotic things if we are doing in our freedom, where is our wisdom? For example, a lady marries eighth time or ninth time and there are four thousand people, more than you, four thousand people watching her going to honeymoon, and there are ten helicopters which are hovering around and they are parachuting down with the cameras, and they fall on the trees or they fall on people.

America is supposed to be the greatest democratic country, if you go there you can’t even wear your wedding ring. The people might kill you for that. So where are we going? There are diseases like aids and schizophrenia, all kinds of diseases and nobody has any solution. The children are becoming murderers, drug addicts, what’s going to happen to us? Is this the reward for our freedom? Are we really free? Freedom without wisdom has no meaning at all.

We take to all kinds of destructive things very easily. For example, Switzerland, which is very affluent as you know, making money out of the third world, is having people who are committing suicides, and other Scandinavian countries who are affluent again, are competing with them in committing suicide.

All this is happening, we see it every day in the newspaper and we are shocked. What is the reason? We should find out, what is the solution. The main problem is that we are not yet fully evolved. We have not yet become the spirit. In our evolutionary state we have become human beings alright, but there has to be something more. The last break through, by which we get our wisdom and we relate it to reality.

So as you are told, this subtle system is within you which works it out. It’s within all of you. It was placed in the triangular bone, which we call as sacrum. That means the Greek knew it’s a sacred bone. So there is already placed within us a power by which we can ascend and become one with this all-pervading power.

Now in the west the whole civilization has grown big, very big, but for this big tree we should know our roots, and the knowledge of the roots if it comes from East why should we mind. For a saint, East and West doesn’t exist.

The solution lies in understanding what we are, and that is very simple. Very easy to get it. Sahaja, means born with you, is the right to have this yoga, meaning the union with this all-pervading power of divine love. Like this instrument here, if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. It has no identity.

In these modern times even to talk about God is out of date, but now the time has come to prove the existence of God. Sahaja Yoga is meta science. Where, when you get connected with this all-pervading power, you can feel the absolute proof on your fingertips.

Even children can feel the same, because spirit is the source of absolute truth. You have been already told there are five, six and seven centres on the right and five, six and seven centres on the left hand. These are sympathetic centres which get enlightened. When this power rises through six centres. She emerges through your seventh here, centre which we call as the fontanel bone area, and you get actualisation again, I say, actualisation of baptism. It is not that somebody puts the water on your head and say you are baptised.

There is no difference between a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone. They can commit the same sins, but once this connection takes place, you start feeling on your finger tips the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost as they call it. Then you know also what’s wrong with you.

Most of the world problems are because of human beings and most of the human problems are because of their subtle centres, because these centres look after your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being, and if you know what’s wrong with you on your fingertips, you have the self knowledge of your being. That means instead of going to the moon, you go within your self.

Now as a result, your physical being is cured. Means many of the incurable diseases have been cured by Sahaja Yoga. Also mental troubles and spiritual troubles which have come by going to wrong places all have been mostly cured. All this curing takes place by your own power, and it’s your own doing, your own understanding which gives you this self realisation.

Then the second thing that happens to you, that on your finger tips you can feel the centres of others. Say, if you think of somebody who is dead or somebody who is far away and just put your hands like this, you can know what centres are in jeopardy. Thus you develop a new dimension in your human awareness which you call as collective consciousness.

Now when we are thinking, we are thinking about the past or about the future. Past is finished and future doesn’t exist. So if I say you have to be in the present you cannot be, but when this power rises she separates these thoughts and between those thoughts there is a space and this space is the present.

So you develop another dimension in your human awareness, which we call, as thoughtless awareness. That means you are aware, absolutely alert, but you are thoughtless. If you want to think you can think if you don’t want to think you need not think. Because of this bombardment of thoughts, you get stress and strain, but then you open out and all your problems are sort of dissolved.

For example, if you are in the water, you are afraid of the waves, but somehow if you can get into the boat, then you can see the waves. You are not disturbed by them but somehow if you learn how to go back jump into the water and swim, you can save many.

This is how Sahaja Yoga works. One person gets his realisation, they get the power to give realisations to others. Like one candle is enlightened can enlighten many candles. This is the purpose of our life and the destiny is that we enter into the Kingdom of God. The life is filled with blessings then. You are completely protected, you enjoy every moment of your life and suddenly you find all over the world you have lots of friends, your own relations.

Because, Spirit is the source of absolute knowledge. Absolute truth. In the light of the Spirit you understand what is right and what is wrong for you. I don’t have to tell you. For example I am holding on to a snake and there is darkness and somebody will say it is a snake, throw away. I will say no it is a rope because I am obstinate. Till the snake bites me I’ll not give up. But supposing there is little light, immediately I’ll throw away. That light, when it comes into you, you know what is constructive for you and what is destructive for you and effortlessly you get transformed.

The Spirit when enlightens your attention, the attention becomes active. Suddenly you find your attention has become innocent. Believe me, innocence cannot be destroyed what ever you may try. Maybe, there may be some clouds, but these clouds once removed you’ll find your innocence completely intact, and your attention becomes absolutely innocent. Such attention is so powerful that wherever you put the attention things work out.

It is benevolent, it is compassionate and it’s very intelligent. The Spirit is the source of joy. Joy is not happiness and unhappiness. It is absolute. In this state of joy, you become the witness. The whole thing looks like a drama and you enjoy your own spiritual powers. Then you don’t develop your ego, because you start talking in third person. For a Sahaja Yogi will say “Mother, It’s not working, it’s not going.” They won’t say “I can’t do it.”

Thus you become an angel. It all sounds very fantastic I agree, but you are fantastic. You are glorious. You don’t know yourself, once you know yourself you will be amazed. Only thing you have to not blindly refuse me or to blindly accept me. The only problem is that I cannot force Sahaja Yoga on you. I respect your freedom. You have to ask for it and if you have the pure desire it works. It works in every one. Also there’s a big fashion to feel guilty for nothing at all. Now if you have done any mistakes you just face it, why do you feel guilty. After all you are human beings, you are not God. And to err is human, what is the use of feeling guilty.

If you feel guilty then this centre here on the left goes into problem. Physically it causes a disease called angina, also it causes you spondylitis maybe, lethargic organs, so why feel guilty. Please don’t judge yourself. This power within you will judge you.

It will hardly take ten to fifteen minutes for you to get your self realisation. But you must be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Not to condemn yourself for anything what so ever. At this moment you are perfect, because this all-pervading power of Divine love is the ocean of forgiveness.

So you have to forgive your self fully. This is the first condition, and the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Logically, whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself.

If you understand it’s a myth, so please don’t even think about them because it’s a headache to think of those people, and in general you forgive.

We have a centre on the optic chasma which is just like this it is closed completely, crossed like this, if you don’t forgive it won’t open, but if you forgive it opens and that’s how the Kundalini can pass through.

If you don’t for give yourself the Kundalini will get stuck here or if you don’t forgive others it will get stuck there. I request you again and again please fulfil these two conditions and the third condition is that you all be very ,very confident that you all will get your Self realisation. After all you are Human Beings. Human Beings are at the epitome of evolution and the journey is hardly three to four feet. So why not?

Of course you cannot pay for it, it’s a living process. Like we put a seed in the Mother Earth and she sprouts by itself. Because it is built in, in the Mother Earth and built in, in the seed that they sprout.

In the same way it is built in within you and whatever is built in within you, works automatically. You don’t have to go to Himalayas to stand on your heads, no you don’t have to suffer. It’s a very strange idea that you should suffer to get to God. Absurd. If God is the person who is your Father, he is the most compassionate. Which Father wants his son to suffer?

So how can the Father of all the Fathers would like to do that? So there’s nothing to suffer here on your chair so you can get your self-realisation. I promise you but, have faith in yourself. Have confidence within your self. It is working out because the time has come and because you are seekers of truth, it’s not meant for idiots and stupid people. It is meant for only seekers of truth. It’s not meant for arrogant people or people who are conditioned and glued to some sort of an organisation. First you have to be free to be absolutely free. This is what it is as in Sanskrit they call it a Realised Soul as dvija means twice born. Even a bird is called as dvija. First a bird is like an egg, then it becomes a bird. In the same way Human Beings also become Realised Souls. I had come to Hamburg about year of 1965 and I had that time only the feeling that Germans are the first who should understand Sahaja Yoga and I’m really surprised how they are sensible to see the point.

That is how not only that you get your realisation, but, you give it to the whole world or surprisingly, very surprisingly it’s in Russia that Sahaja Yoga has taken off. Perhaps they never had any time to waste on choices. I’m not for communism, I’m not for this kind of democracy, but I was amazed the way they were introspecting and now we have thousands and thousands of Russians who are Sahaja Yogis.

It’s a joke, we had a meeting all of us were there in Romania and one (Keliati) Sahaja Yogi from Russia asked an American one, “How many Sahaja Yogis do you have in America?” so he said “We are fifty six.” So this [Keliati] fellow says “Oh my God, we are only twenty one thousand you are fifty six thousand.” So something has worked out and should work out even in Germany I think because you are quite people in the centre and have been seekers of truth since long.

I know these Germans when they came to India they were just seeking about Kundalini, about the truth, they didn’t bother about our diamonds and emeralds and all those things. They didn’t bother. And lastly I have to say that you all must be having some questions so I’ve now become an expert on answering any question what so ever, because I have been doing this for the last twenty three years now. But it is just a mental acrobat. Now for example these electric lights are here, beautiful ones. To put them on you need only one switch, because they are built in, but supposing I have to tell you about the discovery of electricity and how it came to Hamburg and how it came to this hotel. Half of you would leave the hall.

So the best thing is that we get our Enlightenment first.
It’s very simple, very, very simple. Now, there’s only one request I have to make, that you have to take off your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Again those who don’t want to do it can leave the hall.

All of you can come and sit here there is room for you. See these gentleman, there’s room here, on this side.

The first thing you will enjoy is your own peace. There is something so innate within us. I have met people who have got peace awards you see, but they have no peace with them. They are very hot tempered, if you have to go near them, better take a( bath cool) could be (barge pole). So all this hypocrisy finishes. You jump into reality.

Alright it is very good now. Just you be all seated as you are very comfortably, a little straight not too much of backward or forward, but a little straight. You have to put both your feet away from each other. I don’t know if you are told or not, that there are two powers, left and right. These are sympathetic powers and, by left you desire and by right you act. So, we have to put both the feet away from each other and put the left hand like this towards me which is symbolic that you want your realisation. Just to put like this. The left hand. On your lap. Now use your right hand for nourishing your centres. You have to do it yourself. Only here, later on you don’t need. Now, this right hand you have to put it on your heart. In the heart resides, the spirit, if you become the spirit you become your guide, you become your master.

So, you put your right hand on the left hand side of your abdomen on the left hand side. We are working only on the left hand, upper portion of your abdomen. This is the centre of your mastery. Was created by great prophets. I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.
So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre which gives you, the pure divine knowledge, which passes into brain and gets distributed. How it happens, you will know everything later on.

You have to know that this is a collective happening. It’s like a collective organism. The microcosm becomes the macrocosm. Like a drop becomes the ocean. So if a nail is cut out of your body it doesn’t grow, so to grow you have to come to our collective.

For knowing this divine knowledge, you don’t have to pay anything but it becomes your innate knowledge. Only thing, you have to spend little time for your ascent. Ascent with complete maturity.

Alright, so now please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here, I’ve told you that is the centre of your mastery. Now raise your hand on your heart, now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. I’ve already told you about this centre. Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across........

(Tape blank for a minute)

Forgive everyone in general. Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Now here, is the centre where you don’t have to feel guilty, you don’t have to count your mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power. Now please stretch your right hand. Stretch the palm and put the centre of your palm on the fontanel bone. Now this is the last centre.

Now please put down your head, here you have to move your scalp, not your hand so much as your scalp, seven times clockwise, slowly, that’s all we have to do. Now we have to close our eyes put your left and right feet away from each other. Please put your left and right feet away from each other. Please put your left hand on the left lap, and the right hand on your heart. Now hear you close your eyes and please don’t open them till I tell you.

Better to take out your spectacles because maybe your eyesight might improve. Now, here is your Spirit. So ask me a very fundamental question about yourself three times. You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji whatever you like.

Ask please, three times, “Mother am I the Spirit”? Ask in your heart, not aloud please. I’ve already told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your own master. So now please put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it. And here you ask me another fundamental question about your self. Three times, “Mother am I my own master”?

I’ve already told you that I cannot force Divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So now please take your right hand into the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and ask six times, because, this centre has got six petals. “Mother please give me pure knowledge”? Please say it six times. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising, so we have to nourish our higher centres with our full self confidence.

So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here with full self confidence you have to say ten times, “Mother I am my own master”.

I’ve already told you, that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this intelligence, these emotions and conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and with full confidence please say twelve times “Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

This all-pervading divine power, is the ocean of pure knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed get easily dissolved into this ocean of forgiveness.

So now raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck and turn your head to your right. Now forgive your self and with self full confidence please say it sixteen times. “Mother I am not guilty at all”. I’ve already explained to you that whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do any thing. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. All your life you have tortured yourself and at this moment if you don’t forgive, the centre won’t open and you will miss your chance of self realisation. Just forgive, just forgive everyone. Raise your hand on top of your forehead and put down your head and now forgive every one without thinking about them.

Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes you have to say for your satisfaction “Oh Divine Power if I have done anything wrong please for give me” and this you have to say from your heart without counting how many times.

Now for the last centre you have to stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of your head. On the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head, here again I cannot force self-realisation on you. You have to ask for it. So press your scalp, push back your fingers, this is very important to push back your fingers.

Here you move your scalp seven times clockwise. Say “Mother, please give me my self-realisation” seven times.

Sound of Shri Mataji blowing into microphone seven times.

Now please take down your hands. Now please put both your hands open your eyes towards me like this. Now watch me without thinking. You can do it. Now put the left hand towards me and put down your head see with your right hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now if you have not forgiven your self or forgiven others it will be hot breeze. So now please forgive. Forgive everyone and forgive your self.

Now please put right hand again towards me and see with left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. On top of it. A little higher, don’t put it on top. A little higher. Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head, close your eyes and ask a question three times. Anyone of these three questions, first one is “Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost” or “Mother is this the al-pervading power of Divine Love” or “Mother is this the Paramachaitanya or Rue”? You see they are different names for the same thing. So you can ask anyone of these questions three times.

Now take down your hands, please put your hands like this towards me and feel your peace in thoughtless awareness. All those who have felt cool or a hot breeze on their fingertips or on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area please raise both your hands.

The whole of Hamburg, may God Bless you all. May God Bless. My God.

Now again I have to tell you one thing that it’s a collective happening. So you have to come to our collective programs. It’s a very big revolution going on and now you are the part and parcel of that spiritual revolution, which takes humanity to reality and it’s benevolence. You have to be mature in this, otherwise it would be like the parable of Christ where some seeds got sprouted and got lost. Of course you don’t have to pay anything I tell you again and again but, you have to spend some time for your self realisation. You don’t know what you have got. Say if I have German money I don’t know what it means, I have to spend it. In the same way what you have got it’s so precious you will know how precious it is when you will mature and you will give it to others.

So may God bless you.
