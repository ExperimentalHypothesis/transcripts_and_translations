Public Program, October Palace, Kyiv, Ukraine, Sept. 25, 1995
I bow to all the seekers of truth. We have to know at the very outset that Truth is what it is. You can not change it, you can not describe it, you can not transform it. Whatever I’m going to tell you tonight you should not take it for granted. Blind faith has harmed us the most. So it is important that you should keep your minds open like scientist. And then what I’m telling you should be treated like a hypothesis. If it is proved then as honest people you have to accept it. Because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your family, benevolence of your city, your country and for the benevolence of the whole world. 
At this juncture when we are facing problems all over the world it is important to understand why do we have problems. The problems are there because we do not know the absolute Truth. You don’t know about your physical, emotional, mental being. And it is said that if you don’t know yourself, you can not know God or Divinity. We say, “This is my hand, this is my head, my…”, but who is this “My”? So what is the truth? – That you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this emotions, you are not this intelligence. You are not this ego or your conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit. For example if I am born in a Christian family or a Hindu family or a Muslim family, immediately I accept the conditionings. Without understanding what good it has done to the world or to yourself. And thus we start living in a hanging condition.
So the second Truth is that there is the All Pervading Power of Divine Love, which does all the living work. You see here such beautiful flowers. It’s a miracle. We never know how it comes out of one seed, one bulb of these beautiful flowers. We take all these for granted. If you ask a doctor, “Who runs your heart?”, he will say, “It’s an autonomous nervous system”. But who is this “Auto”? Who looks after us? This is what one has to understand that there is a superior Power beyond us, which does all these things.
I find the people of Russia and Ukraine too much impressed by the Americans. I just don’t understand because compare to you Americans are just stupid people. They have no wisdom. Compare to you they don’t understand life. To them every moment must be spent in enjoyment. And every enjoyment they discover is self-destructive. It has destroyed their body with horrible diseases. It has destroyed their mind with perversion and schizophrenia. It has destroyed the whole society, the family, everything by their own idea of this enjoyment. You people living here must be thinking that the whole country is paved with gold. It is such a violent country that every individual is a Mafia. When I go to America I’ve to take out all these ornaments, which I supposed to wear from My family. Their music is maddening. There was one fellow who was really mad while singing, mad. That was no music but it was just like a shouting noise. And then he used to take out the whole of his trot out as if. Itself the singing was horrifying. And he called his group as ‘Nirvana’, meaning the liberation, ultimate spiritual liberation. And ultimately though he used to drink, smoke, take drugs, ultimately committed suicide. I think is important you must see some of them and know about what sort of a country it is.
So God has given you this wisdom. Because you have been ancient people. Do you know about your ancient history? I was so surprised to read about it. You have a great relationship with Indians. They say the Ukraine name came from a king called Kuru. He was the forefather of Pandavas and Kauravas in India. Also it was said that Shri Rama came here and built this place – Kyiv. Before the Christian religion came in there were such beautiful faiths in this Kundalini.
(Shri Mataji speaks aside) Is it now Kundalini? They have put it there. All right. 
All right. In the... I studied the paintings and the museum pieces where it is absolutely shown this Kundalini there, see now. They’ve shown the Primordial Mother and Her Kundalini they have shown in the paintings. And the lowest Chakra that is the called Mooladhara that has got like a swastika frame. Is all there in the paintings. Everything, all these Chakras, everything there. And you don’t know what were your forefathers. They were all very spiritual. This spirituality has given such fertile land to you. I was amazed the way in this country spirituality was thriving at that time. Now I know why you people and Russians are so sensitive to spirituality. Is in your blood. You can’t help it. You will be never satisfied with something artificial. For the time maybe impressed by America. But you will realize its stupidity. And you’ll come back to your original culture. I was amazed how these people in those days. They called themselves Aryans and also they came to India and so many from India came here. For a normal Indian the goal of life is to get Self-Realization. As also Christ has said that, “Know thy Self” and also Mohammed Sahib has said, “The one who does not know himself is not a complete person and he can not know about Divinity”. With all these sayings and understanding one knows the goal of his life. And from ancient times, three thousand before Christ in this country people knew their goal. Not drinking, not other dirty things they do in America. Only the false people can impress them. They only understand money. How can a spiritual person be money oriented? Those who are money oriented can not be near God. But as a blessing of God all kind of prosperities come. You don’t have to run after prosperity, the prosperity runs after you.
So within you (Shri Mataji asks the interpreter, “Somebody has told them about Kundalini?” He answers, “Yes, yes, Shri Mataji”). So within you is already placed this great instrument by our Creator. All of you have this within you. This is your own Mother. Everybody has an individual Mother. It’s like a tape recorder of your past and your aspirations. She knows everything about you. And She’s anxious to give you your second birth. This is all your own. Now we have become humane beings in the evolutionary process, which is the living process. And now there’s going to be one more break through by which this Kundalini rises like a primula in the seed and passes through you fontanel bone area, becomes one with the All Pervading Power of Divine Love. Just like this instrument (Shri Mataji indicates to the microphone), if it is not connected to the mains, has no meaning, we have no meaning. We have no personality. We go on drifting from here to there. When this happens then you are connected with this All Pervading Power and this Power starts flowing through you on your fingertips. So you can feel the Absolute Truth on your fingertips because you know what Chakras are in trouble. Also you know about others because you get connected with this All Pervading Power, you develop a new dimension called as ‘collective consciousness’. With this new awareness you can know the centers of others. All your problems are there because your centers are in jeopardy. Through this awakening of the Kundalini there have been thousands and thousands of cures of incurable diseases. If you remember first time when I came here there were so many people sick of Chernobyl this thing. And with the Kundalini awakening they got cured. All their problems solved. None of them died. They must be some people sitting here. That’s the minimum. There are four doctors in India who have got now MD in Sahaja Yoga. In Russia there are about I think two hundred doctors were following Sahaja Yoga and curing people for no money at all. So money is not so important.
The second thing that happens to you that you become mentally absolutely peaceful. Like our thoughts rise and fall, rise and fall and they come to us from our past and from the future. And our mind is jumping on the cusp of the thoughts. If I say, “Now, come to your present”, you can not. But when this Kundalini rises she separates the thoughts and elongates them and you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware but you are thoughtless. That is the present. Thus your memory becomes just photogenic. Now for example this carpet is not Mine, is very beautiful. Normally I would think how much to pay, how much to buy. If it is Mine also I would think it should not get spoiled. But when I see in thoughtless awareness all the joy that is putting to it to make it starts pouring on Me as soothing current. In the present if you want you can think and if you don’t want you don’t think. You become absolutely peaceful. And then you start emitting peace to others. Wherever you go you can create peace. Not by giving awards people have peace. On the contrary I’ve seen this people are very hot tempered. They have Peace Award, but you can’t talk to them, they jump on you. So one has to understand that there is a space within us for peace, which not only makes you peaceful but makes others also peaceful.
The third thing that happens to you that your attention becomes enlightened. Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”. But your attention becomes moral, becomes. I don’t have to say, “Don’t do this, don’t do that”. Only in the light of Spirit you yourself become absolutely moral. We can say, like angels. So this is within you, which works out. I’ve seen some criminals becoming angels because the data base of their genes change also. It is so fantastic! But you are fantastic you are glorious. Only thing you have to get connected.
Now one has to know that this All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the Ocean of compassion and love. It is the Ocean of knowledge. All the real knowledge you know, not from the books, not from the words, but the real knowledge about Reality. It is the Ocean of so many miracles and so many blessings. But above all it is the Ocean of forgiveness. Whatever wrong you might have done, whatever mistakes you might have committed, all are forgiven by this Divine Power of Love. Truth is love, love is peace, and all of them are one. You become the master of it. You don’t dominate others, don’t torture others, but you love. And this love is without any lust or greed. Above all this Ocean of Love is the Ocean of Joy. You become joyous. Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness. It is singular. You enjoy yourself, you enjoy the nature, you enjoy everything. It is such a remarkable thing that is going to happen. We can say now there is a global transformation. So there will be no wars, no arguments, no discussions. Because everybody will know the same truth. No fixed ideas, it is just Reality.
I was so impressed by your forefathers who have done so much already for spirituality. And I’m sure you all have a special right to become one with this Divine Power. It’s like you put a seed in the Mother Earth and it sprouts by itself. And your forefathers believed in the Mother Earth as the Primordial made of the Primordial Mother, She has made it. Imagine they have Kundalini depicted. How many people in the world knew about Kundalini except for Indians? But surprisingly the Colombians also, the ancient Colombians knew about Kundalini. That was their faith. They might have seen it, they might have felt it. So you have such blessings of your forefathers. It’s going to work out, I know all of you are going to get your Self-Realization tonight. Only thing you must have faith in yourself. You should not feel guilty about anything. You don’t have to confess anything to Me, you don’t have to change your dress or change your hair style, nothing of the kind. It is not superficial, it is within. But you must have full self-confidence in you. You must know that you are going to get it and that you have to forgive yourself. If you have committed some mistakes, finished. What’s the use of feeling guilty?
Another thing is – you have to forgive everyone from your heart. Only thing is that as the Mother Earth has the power to germinate, the seed has built-in power to get germinated, you also get your Realization in the sense the awakening of the Kundalini. But you must look after your Self-Realization. We have some very good Sahaja Yogis here who can guide you how to meditate only for ten minutes in the evening. But you should not leave it in the middle (Shri Mataji laughs). It would be like the parable of Christ that some seeds cast to germinated and were thrown in the marsh, you see, that’s will be something like that. If you respect yourself then this Self-knowledge should grow. It’s for free, you can not pay for Divine love. Many people don’t understand how much do we pay to this Mother Earth for this flowers? Because this is your own, your own right to have your Self-Realization. So time is there, we have to have our experience of Self-Realization. And we have to feel this All Pervading Power for the first time.
So I would request you, all of you, first of all to have full self-confidence. Then to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Now you might say (Shri Mataji speaks to the interpreter, “Tell him afterwards, all right?”), you, you might say that is difficult to forgive. But just think logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive what do you do? So you don’t do anything. But you torture yourself for nothing at all. All your life you torture yourself like that. But at this moment is very important that there is a center what we call the optic chiasma in the brain where is this center. And this center is like this constricted. It won’t open unless and until you forgive everyone. So how will the Kundalini come up? Now when you don’t forgive and feel guilty this center catches here on the left very badly. Physically also you might develop a disease called as angina for the heart. Also spondylitis and lethargic organs. So please forgive yourself. At this moment is very important that this center should open and this center should open so the Kundalini will rise.
You go beyond the mind into Reality. When we have the power of our mind we just moves in a linear way. And it then recoils because no truth in it and harms you. Can harm the society like Freud. He had some funny ideas, he has harmed Americans completely, like Hitler. So many of them. But if it is the light of the Spirit it moves in all the sides. It penetrates into all subtle things and never recoils. So you have to develop your spiritual awareness.
When I come I know there are thousands and thousands, but when I go away that doesn’t mean you should not grow. So when I come there is a kind of a periodic sort of understanding. But it’s a living process, you have to look after it and you have to grow into it.
Once you achieved the second state, which we call as doubtless awareness, you will know how great you are, what powers you have. I’ve seen people becoming great scientist, great artist and great musicians through Sahaja Yoga. Even the children become very-very intelligent, alert and obedient and moral. Overnight I’ve seen people giving up drugs, alcoholism, all these destructive things. Now I am seventy-three years of age Myself and I’m traveling every third day and I don’t feel tired. Because humane energy is limited. But if he gets this Divine energy then what does it matter? So to make it flow into you, you must grow into it. This is My request as a Mother.
So it will take hardly about five-ten minutes for you to feel your Realization through this All Pervading Power. I would request you not to disturb at that time. If you want you can go away before we start it so that people are not disturbed. One thing, I can not force it on you because I respect your freedom. And in your freedom you have to ask for it. You must have pure desire to have it. Because this Kundalini is the power of pure desire. So I’ll wait for one minute, if somebody wants to leave, can leave.
(Shri Mataji speaks to the interpreter, “No one. Great people”.) All right (Shri Mataji laughs). 
All right. (Shri Mataji speaks to the interpreter, “Might just get it like that. All right.”)
First I’ll try a very short method (Shri Mataji laughs), which has worked in Russia. All right. Now please put your hands like this towards Me. Don’t close your eyes. Now please put your left hand towards Me like this and now bend your head and now see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. (Shri Mataji blows 7 times in the microphone.)
Now, please now put your right hand towards Me. Now again bend your head and please see with your left hand if you are feeling cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself and you have not forgiven others.
Now, take the left hand now. All of you must do, please do. Now bend your head again and put your right hand and see if there’s a cool or hot breeze coming out of your own head. Sometimes it comes nearer the head, sometimes little away. But don’t touch your head. Above the head, above.
Now, please now put both your hands towards Me like that and watch Me without thinking.
Now, please put both your hands towards the sky like this and ask a question, one of them in your heart. Put up your head and say, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Ask three times in your heart. Otherwise you can ask, “Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?” Again three times. Or else you can ask, “Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?” Again three times in your heart.

Now bring down your hands. All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their fontanel bone area, have to raise their hands.
(Shri Mataji laughs) See? Quite all. May God bless you all. See, this is the first time you are feeling this breeze. I told you that this is a country of very spiritual people. This is a proof. All of you have felt it. But I again request you that please try to continue to grow till I come next year.
Another simple thing you can see these are Ukrainian people singing so well Hindi songs, Marathi songs, Sanskrit songs. If you don’t see them you will think they are Indians singing it. (Shri Mataji laughs.) It’s very difficult. But how they have managed that I don’t know. So let them sing one song I would like also to hear. Which one – “Anadi Nirguni”? ‘Jogawa’? You’ll sing ‘Jogawa’? Ah, this is the song written in the sixteen century by a saint in India in Maharashtra, My state, in a Marathi language. He is saying, “Oh, Mother, give me this Yoga, this union with the Divine”. And then he says, “I will give up all that is bad, all that is wrong, I’ll do everything but give me this Yoga”. And all the people in the villages sing this, they don’t know what it is. It is now the other way out. You don’t have to give up anything. You don’t have to go to Himalayas. Here, sitting here, you can get your Yoga, your union with the Divine.
(Yogis are singing the song.)
May God bless you all. Please respect your Self-Realization, respect yourself. All My love. I’ll come next year again to meet you all. Ah, if you have any problem you can write to Me through the leaders here. Thank you.
