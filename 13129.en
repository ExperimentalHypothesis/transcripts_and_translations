1982 0705 Guru Purnima Seminar Day 3, Nirmala Palace, Nightingale Lane Ashram, London (UK) How to deal with bhoots.

Please note there are many instances in this tape where the words are inaudible due to background noise, talking etc.

(Shri Mataji talking in Indian Language to someone)

Shri Mataji: For me I think August is a better idea.

Yogi: There is no problem with Scotland either Mother, Gavin said he could adjust accordingly just whatever you choose, for Switzerland he can adjust Scotland accordingly.

Shri Mataji: Do what you please, I mean I would say do what you please. Because I ruined his timing August I just thought would be cool but I don't know. If September is better then I'll come in September, I mean if Mathias can bring more people according to him you see we have to be pragmatic.

Yogi: Mmmmm
Yogi: Yes but we are not sure that it will be more, we can't be sure.

Shri Mataji: So, what I am saying anyway you go and see for yourself, if the hall is done, I mean still there's time. Alright?

Yogi: Yes Mother

Shri Mataji: Well and good, if not I'll come whatever you say

Yogi: Mother originally thought August was the best time, that was her original time.

Yogi: Yes August but they altered it.

Shri Mataji: But he told me Mathias told me that you can have more people you see, my main thing is ??? I want to go there.

Yogi: Yes yes
Shri Mataji: What about tea these people will.... Yogi: I've made it?
Yogi: No trouble Mother

Yogi: Only that we can say that we tried to discuss all our, all our offers you see that the date and so on not the date because you weren't saying which the date you want, but, and so it was just by luck like that, by himself, that's what was changed.

Shri Mataji: ??? I think Mathias is not sure of that so you tell him that Mother said its alright for me if he has got the hall got everything that means it is Sahaja , I will see because now my stay is spread out a little, you see it came out the idea that in any case it is spread out like I can do it. But I will be better off there in August. I personally think from my point of view September is very cold I don't like it, if it is very hot also I don't like it, but you can manage heat, but you can't manage cold?

Yogi: Mother we have, Mother after the last program in London we had a few people coming getting realisation and then coming afterwards and one of the ladies is about to have an operation and it was difficult for us to see whether I mean she should go through with this operation or not. It's in the intestines.

Shri Mataji: In the what?
Yogi: This is her picture Mother She wanted me to show you.

Shri Mataji: Ah.?? .she is catching on the heart, on the heart See if you think all the time about other things than the spirit then you develop all these problems better think about the spirit...............left nabhi, is she married?

Yogi: No Mother
Shri Mataji: What
Yogi: No,........I don't know
Shri Mataji: ?
Yogi: We could just telephone the girl just to find out

Shri Mataji: Nowadays...?? In England
But you can overcome it you see, but marriage is for having children, if she develops that feeling that Ginny has done then you can do it.

Y. Bridget! (Calling in background) your little boys!
Shri Mataji: you have overcome your left nabhi, you get little bit. Yogi: Bridget! (Calling in background)
Yogi: No Mother

Shri Mataji: If you develop that feeling, see she is not married, but you can get over your left nabhi by thinking that you are living for others for other children, you see they are your children, if you develop that Motherhood without getting married there is no need to have a marriage.

Yogi: We have so many children now.

Shri Mataji: We have so many children now they are all your children isn't it , be comfortable, it may be that, that thing is making you rather uncomfortable. Then pull it out, pull it out.

Yogi: Christiane is staying in London for 6 weeks Mother Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Christiane is staying in London for 6 weeks Mother Shri Mataji. Good, good, that's a good idea, that's good.

Yogi: She will.

Shri Mataji: You must bring some speed in Sahaja Yogis here, you see they must be sent to Switzerland and Swiss people should come here.

Yogi: That's very....

Yogi: Yes we will

Yogi: Ah that raises another question Mother, the young man from Belgium, Robbert, he is in a little dilemma, he would like to stay for a few days just to get more experience. He would like to come with me to Brighton tonight. I am going down there, and he has a little program in Brussels tonight. And he was wondering whether to stay for a few days to get some extra experience or whether to go back. Should he? Do you think that he should stay for a while, he would like to in all honesty.

Shri Mataji: I think he should.

Yogi: He only has one or two people coming regularly and he could ring them up.

Shri Mataji: He should stay it would be better, he's very good.

Yogi: He's very good Mother he's gone into it so thoroughly and so assiduously

Shri Mataji: So remarkable

Shri Mataji: Pure intelligence. From Rajneesh, imagine

Yogi: Really,

Shri Mataji: Yes

Yogi: My God.

Shri Mataji: he came with those clothes I believe.

Yogi: Mother we gave him, you gave him realisation in Paris, and he came and I said why don't you come to London and he came to London.

Shri Mataji: He was from Rajneesh
Yogi: Really, how amazing.
Shri Mataji: He was horrible. When he came to me
Yogi: He stayed in a hotel I remember
Shri Mataji: . Right heart Ravanna. Right heart Alright? Yogi: That explains my dream Mother
Shri Mataji: Mmmmmm (What was that?)

Yogi: It was a very big dream, you were talking to me, I don't know what you were saying but at the end of the conversation the last sentence you said "you see even Ravanna was a realised soul" that's all. "You see even Ravanna was a realised soul".

Shri Mataji: Yes I mean a realised soul doesn't mean that you pass out, that's not my meaning. It doesn't mean that you pass out.

Yogi: No you can go the other.

Shri Mataji: You have to develop, you have to become, I mean you see if you, if your seed sprouts the process is so simple I mean I don't know how you people don't understand. You see, supposing the seed sprouts, it doesn't become a tree does it? You have to become the tree, a realised soul doesn't...it's too easy

Yogi: Yes ha ha, you are supposed to go that way not that way

Shri Mataji: Ha, On the contrary when they become realised souls, they think that now you have become a big tree, but first you have to work out. Downwards then upwards. I wanted to talk to Dr Singh, I said I want to know what is the problem with these people the intellectuals, what are they quarrelling about these vaitas? Or advaitas? Duality and similarity and why were they are criticising Adi Shankaracharya? And what he told me was very interesting. He said because they were arguing you see Adi Shankaracharya could not tell them so he stopped ??? ...he wrote all these duties and philosophy and he said that better talk about Chaitanya, ??? and all these vibrations, better not talk about it. He just started talking about ??? And all these duties and he said that I will be....?? And that's how people said he was lost. I said that's true, he had a little limitation, he could not give them their realisation. If you have given them realisation then you can talk, you see they are not at that point that you can talk about it. That it's all God, everything is God, but he is not Rock of Gibraltar. I mean it's so simple you know. Everything's so simple.

Yogi: Mother perhaps you would be good enough to just repeat this, a few words about pragmatic, pragmatism, perhaps you would be prepared to talk about.

Shri Mataji: Yes. I have not taken my breakfast, I think I told you a little bit of a something you see. Ah yes, you know ??? (Speaks in Indian Language)

Shri Mataji: Not this, you see in this house we have so many presents where you place what I got in Spain Somebody gave me as a present so sweet of them, ?? when will I use all that it's just....... So what did you want? You said pragmatic....

Yogi: Just about pragmatic

Shri Mataji: You see pragmatic is like this. At the time of say Muhammed Sahib so many men were killed, and there were very few men and many women. So for the society the laws were formed according to the pragmatic values. That is so many men are there and so many women are there, so he thought that let us have the right proportion of men to the women. Alright? So to achieve maximum morality, maximum morality in the society. Because if you say that only one woman for one man the remaining women will be left and naturally they are not realised souls they cannot control themselves, there will be a problem. So Alright? Five women for one man is alright. Then there were some young girls who could be married, may not be married, you see because people didn't want to marry young girls, that style, because they thought, they were, you see sensitive people don't want to marry young girls because very young girls are like their daughters you see.
If you are a sensitive person cannot have feeling for a young girl, you cannot, so just to cut it down at that point, that kind of a feeling alright? Marrying young girls because what will happen to the young girls? Nobody will marry them. It's the other way round. Now today the society is just the other way round. I would say that in England if you can have shariat it would be a good idea, not in Riyad, but it won't work out, you can't have shariat you cannot say that if this man looks at a woman he must be killed by stoning. Can he do that? You cannot have this principle, that's not the position, so what have you to do? You have to be pragmatic. For a place like western countries what should we do? What is the law that will suit them? Tell me,

Yogi: Gross laws, not to make eyes you mean? Shri Mataji: What, what is it?

Yogi: Not to make eyes at woman, I mean you shall not sin with your eyes. Shri Mataji: What is the law?
Shri Mataji You should not sin?
Yogi: You should not sin with your eyes.

Shri Mataji: That's true, but that's after Sahaja yoga what about before Sahaja yoga? You see when the people think "What's wrong" what should God do at this point? This is after realisation of course it is alright to know for the definite. But before realisation what should be the law? What should be the situation, pragmatic, of God, what is pragmatic law?

Yogi: Try somehow to find a way to re establish dharma, I mean it's...

Shri Mataji: It's alright, that is for incarnations to do.

Yogi: Marry

Shri Mataji: (Speaks in Indian Language). It is somewhere kept? ???? try to find out, it's alright. (Speaks again in Indian Language)

Yogi: OK so he has to play tricks, he has to use the ego, maybe the superego as a means of getting people to change.

Shri Mataji: When they have gone that bad. When they realise that they have gone bad now, allow them to destroy themselves, let them get cancers, let them get all physical problems, then let them get all dirty diseases, when they indulge into these things, let them get bad eyes, let them get all kinds of problems physically, then mentally, let them be confused, let them commit suicide. Let them be condemned by themselves. When they are going on and on with it let them be finished by themselves. Let them be absolutely crushed. Because they are playing tricks against God, you see they are finding methods of tricking God. It's alright, go ahead. Get yourselves completely destroyed. Now smoking, give up smoking, people have started, younger people are not smoking, drinking, give up drinking. Let's start. Close down their pubs and close down their racing courses, close down their sea shores.

Yogi: Close down our Soho
Yogi: Soho
Shri Mataji: Close down Soho, is it coming up.
Yogi: It's starting to go down a bit Mother, they are out of work.

Shri Mataji: So like Roman Empire destroy, and this is the condition in which I have been working. Where you are just on the verge of getting destroyed from there to pull you out because at that point only you will accept my situation. Otherwise you will not. Just at the drowning point I have arrived to save you because otherwise you won't listen to me I'm too good to be true. That's a very delicate work. But when you are at the point of destruction then only you think of your identification with yourself, till then you are identified with many other things.

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: Then real love for yourself comes in, Oh I must save myself. When that comes up that's the basis of Sahaja Yoga. At this time only at that point one can do it. Then selfish love goes away then perfectionist love comes in. You see you have to perfect yourself. This is the point.

.......in her Left hand. Clear out quite a lot she's better now, since yesterday she is better. The question I will not say that because that again that gives her. I am going to work it out strictly with her so she must be ....

See everybody who is at the top has got this problem, Gavin his wife, Gregoire his wife, Mathias his wife, Warren his wife.

Yogis talking this part unintelligible

Yogi: You have to be at the point that's all.

Shri Mataji: Yes I mean you have reached that conclusion, but that's true one reaches to that conclusion that's true. But these nonsensical marriages it is better not to marry. You have to have Sahaja Yoga. See like. Jane and all that, I mean I don't know what to do with Jane. I don't know what to do with Mathias wife. She said Mother when can we meet again, and others I said forget it, at the time, just forget it.

Yogi: It is finished, the milk is finished. Shri Mataji: Mmmmm?
Yogi: The milk has curdled, excuse me (Talking in background)

Shri Mataji: She knows him, she was born like this ?? , but what. But why don't you put in your will power, why don't you get after yourself. So why do you give a way to these things. I have taken a promise from you that you will not cry even once. Why do you try these things again? You know Gregoire is getting a repulsion for it, believe me, I am telling you, and then you don't blame me later on. I am warning you, look at Mathias now, he does not know what to do with this woman she plays tricks with him with herself, why is she doing it, why you are not sincere to yourself. What is the pleasure? How can you be satisfied, watch your mind, what it teaches you. Why does it make you cry, Just think of it. I would like to know what it does to you. What does it teach you? What does it say to you? Does it say that you are very miserable, this, this, then what does it do, just tell me that.

Yogi: I think it's a lack of confidence in myself.

Shri Mataji: But how, how, that this is the basis, this is the trick, you are not actually, you are over confident, because you have been able to destroy, don't think, don't think that you lack in confidence, you are overconfident your bhoots are extremely confident, what makes you think you are lacking confidence.

Yogi: I feel pressure here.

Shri Mataji: That's now, thats come up now, but otherwise it was coming from left swadisthan, and left swadisthana can never be lacking in confidence. They are doing ?? . they are going against God, they are doing anti God activities do you think that anybody would indulge into anti God activity if they were afraid of themselves.

Yogi: They must have absolute courage.

Shri Mataji: Yes. These are all the tricks they play, like even Jane told me that Mother she is rejected by everyone, I said really who told you that? I mean you create a situation in which everybody should 

reject you and then you make a capital out of it and say that everybody has rejected me. Now tell me what is this?

Yogi: Trick

Shri Mataji: It's very clever, it's very clever, indeed it's a very clever thing, one should know. Why are you playing into the hands of the bhoots now, why? Raise yourself up, rise above it. You have got the Kundalini, you have got the Kundalini with you. Then why should you worry, you have to be brave, what's the use of getting realisation if you are not going to be brave people.

Yogi: The trick is to be braver than the bhoots.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Yogi: The bhoots are over confident and make you think yourself are confident.

Shri Mataji: No they don't make you feel, you play tricks into their hands.

Yogi: It's a trick

Shri Mataji: It's a trick, OK? A trick.

Yogi: You know you are not really under confident that's the spoken word, but in fact they are so damned confident that they tell you even to say I am not confident.

Shri Mataji: They say everything and then Sahaja Yoga is a very good method because you know chakras, and you can say I am catching here, I am catching there, it is the bhoot catching.

Yogi: It's the negativity
Shri Mataji: Mmmmmmm Thats another trick
Yogi: Mother after Guru puja I thought that left sidedness was an indulgence. Shri Mataji: Absolutely 100% you have said it
Yogi: absolutely
Shri Mataji: Absolutely you have said it.
Yogi: Completely It's pure indulgence.

Shri Mataji: Absolutely you have said it. It's pure indulgence "Our sweetest songs are those
songs .........You see this was sarcastically said by Shakespeare, because he was ??
It was said sarcastically, but nobody understood him. It's a very great indulgence absolutely just like alcohol.

Yogi: This is the whole point that it is indulging the bhoots we should stand up to them.

Shri Mataji: I am very miserable, I have told you one month, count your blessings one by one. Now look at this one, their situation.....

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: Look at Jane, Jane had landed herself into such a problematic situation that nobody would have accepted at all. She had really ruined herself. But she was saved. She came back, she has 

such a sweet child, oh she has a husband who is ?? Count your blessings, I've told look at her, count your blessings, where she was and where she is.

She had a mother who was so horrifying everything and she has a husband like Gregoire, she has a child like this one and she is destroying him destroying the child. It is an indulgence of a very sadistic way sadistic level. You had better go on condemning yourself, then only you will get rid of it, when you tell yourself that I am now enjoying the filth, then only you will improve. Absolutely, it is an indulgence of the worst type. It's an indulgence from right, from alcohol to everything it is an indulgence. It is a habit you enjoy and you don't see what..how you are troubling others. Egotistical people are better because whenever they trouble you, you can see obviously. ?? But these so called sympathy seekers, they don't know how they torture others, create problems for others. Make them miserable. Alright, I have said come along if you want to suffer, better suffer, like Jews, in particular, if you want it you can have it. You had better enjoy now. So enjoy that Hitler.

Y; You were saying earlier Mother that we were all the time making rules for others, we forget about keeping strict with ourselves, this is very important.

Shri Mataji: That's what I said that your relationship with yourself should be of perfecting yourself, you should be a tyrant with yourself. See look at me how tyrannical I am being. You have terrible egos in the Guru Puja sort of you felt oh we are the privileged ones sort of thing, was there a little bit too much. So I broke my finger, I am tyrannical with my body. The amount of work I do. The amount of exertion I put in, I am really tyrannical I will tell you. Sometimes I really pity this body of mine the amount of pressures I take upon my....I'm really tyrannical towards myself. I want you to take out one bhoot and you go mad, but how many bhoots I am taking in if you see your Mother you see ??........came to me a little girl from there she said you are making a burning forest out of your mind. I mean the way you work hard say ??? your being is really being made into a burning fire by you. The way you are burning yourself, and you are rubbing yourself like a chandan. Oh God I am tyrannical, with myself, you don't.......absolutely tyrannical.

Yogi: May I ask you if we are thinking about that that we are making you suffering and so on, I mean. At first to be .....??..to be better, can you see my point? Can you explain...

Shri Mataji: Yes I understand that, that's what I am doing.
Yogi: And so, If we are thinking of what we are doing to you Mother, we will be more Shri Mataji: Yes, Because you are part and parcel of me.
Yogi: Now we have to think of a very very ???....time

Shri Mataji: Alright>. From that angle you think well and good otherwise at least if you can't think of me think of yourself. Of perfecting yourself. if that you can think like that you are very kind. But if you cannot be kind to me at least be kind to yourself. Whichever way you move you have got caught up.

This is the centre and then dealing with the anyone you must be pure relationships, you are a Sahaja Yogi that's a Sahaja Yogi. Alright. So a Sahaja Yogi must deal with the way Sahaja Yoga the way he is. If he is a good Sahaja Yogi he must respect, if he is doing work for Sahaja Yoga he is helping me. But if there is a Sahaja Yogi say, a Sahaja yogi who has been destroying Sahaja Yoga who has been troubling, be harsh. Be very harsh, but I have seen Sahaja Yogis will always sympathise with the person who is destructive, and will try to pull down a person who is constructive, isn't it true?

Yogi: Absolutely true Mother that is so precisely the problem.

Shri Mataji: When I said you must respect Sahaja Yogis they will only respect the person who is a destructive person. The other day you see they are complaining to me first of all about Terry, who is the, his name is Terry? Kerry, Kerry, somebody told me about him, first complained of him so I said who complained. They said Susan. I said that's it to begin with Miss Susan is a miserable creature who makes everybody miserable, but is not miserable herself, she is quite smiling herself. I said nothing doing , that's not the thing and she is aware of it now.. And then I asked her I said why were you upset? So she said Mother really I don't know why, now she has reached that stage she is better, she was like that now she is much better, she's much better and improving herself. She realised that this was a mistake with her and she is perfecting herself. When I asked Kerry, Kerry is from Australia, everybody likes him, vibration wise he ???? What is wrong with Kerry? He started complaining about ? He has also has all the rules and regulations for others but himself he has nothing.

Yogi: He is a typical example.

Shri Mataji: He is very good at making rules and regulations for others also with Mr Nick, all such people are very good organisers but no rules and regulations for himself. So being on these three points you topple down, so we have to be tyrannical with yourself. When you are dealing with other Sahaja yogis you have to be respectful and kind and loving and affectionate, but with the Sahaja yogis who are not Sahaja yogis but who are destroying Gods work you have to be harsh. But if I scold somebody I see everybody is going ah he's ....

Yogi: Yes
Shri Mataji: It's alright.

Yogi: What's happened to Jane, poor Jane you know, that's how they were talking in the Ashram, it's absolutely stupid.

Shri Mataji: Absolutely stupid, on the contrary you must support me.

Yogi: Mother when you scold I have never felt ego pressure behind the scolding.

Shri Mataji: Yes because you are a sensible man.

Yogi: It's a privilege when Mother scolds

Shri Mataji: It's tyranny for me to scold, You don't know, I don't like it at all.

Yogi: But there's not the same kind of pressure behind it, means there is no ego behind it to make it negative, it's.....

Shri Mataji: If you are sensible

Yogi: It's a positive.........

Shri Mataji: If you are sensible, I am trying to take out something from your head because unless and until I do that it won't go away I know that. You are much more sensible. But see Mandy is not so much sensible as you, she is not . So it's a question of sensibility. Gregoire used to scold me left and right I mean poor fellow he would come down pulling his ears for the book you know. Poor fellow was writing a book and on top of that I am sitting on his head all the time. I am telling him, this is not sweet, this is not so direct, this that, poor fellow you see dealing with me, when I know everything how to do, poor fellow he didn't know what to do with himself. But he was a sensible man he knew that whatever I was doing for him or for the book was for the better, and he never objected never objected , it's pure intelligence.

You are more intelligent than Mandy is definitely, no doubt sensible person means pure intelligence doesn't it, sense comes from your intelligence only. It doesn't come from education or anything it comes from within. It's the wisdom. But now Mandy because she got a child's sake and all that, then she realised and she's come up. Of course I didn't want to punish the child but the child was punished by her family, ??? Then she realised, and she came up.

Yogi: It was both because I didn't assert myself as a guru because I knew the truth bu compromised. Yes I compromised the life

Shri Mataji: Very compromised

Shri Mataji: You see one can be henpecked if the wife is sensible but if she is not then you become really ruined absolutely, it is a horrible thing to do is to listen to your wife. Otherwise you should listen to your wife, you see she's nice because she's shakti, she can tell you properly. But if she's like this like child, child????

Yogi: Very nice

Shri Mataji: She'll bring him round, she said Mother don't, I will bring him back, and then he will be back, she's finding methods and ways

Yogi: That's the pure quality of shakti.
Shri Mataji: In her own small way she is, but she is really really dynamic. Yogi: ?

Shri Mataji: First when I met her in ??? at Holi. You see first day when I met her she said Mother are my vibrations absolutely ruined or are they still there. I said they are still there. She thought that fighting out these things she might have lost her vibrations, that's all she wanted to ascertain, I said You are caught up but vibrations are alright caught up.

Shri Mataji: That's the thing.

Yogi: What you have said Mother I think it is tremendously important and.....

Shri Mataji: Mmmmmmm

Yogi: A new phase I think where we have to be absolutely strict with ourselves, we have to be absolutely disciplined within our own lives.

Shri Mataji: Shri Krishna himself who came as a collective being has said this, see what he said that for a greater cause a smaller thing can be sacrificed. Say you are working for your country alright then you have to sacrifice your children, you love them but still.

Yogi: Shri Ram did it, Shri Krishna did it.
Shri Mataji: Everybody did it.
Shri Mataji: For a greater cause you have to give up something that alternative ??

Yogi: In my own case Mother when I had to face this horrible problem that I had, it was absolutely, I just felt like destroying as if I was being destroyed, and then when I took a stand and I sent her out of the ashram and did what I had to do, it all started to work out and then..........

Shri Mataji: In your case luckily I must say in his case one thing would happen that the whole thing came up so speedily.
Some people you see develop this disgust. Then this that that then gradually. Then another person starts becoming stronger stronger stronger stronger, but if you can do it with a little sharpness as he has done it is better.

Yogi: you don't give the bhoots a chance

Shri Mataji: But your wife had no chance, never she had. When he asked me I was shocked

Yogi:Yes

S: I was really shocked, for one minute I didn't say anything, I just kept quiet and then I said alright, I hope you'll be happy that's all. Happy.

Yogi: Yes you did Mother not...??
Shri Mataji: Ego
Yogi: Ego pampering
Shri Mataji: You can't understand your choices.
Yogi: It's absolutely stupid But I am wiser for it. Thanks. Shri Mataji: She's not a Sahaja yogi

Yogi: Not at all not at all. God knows what it was. But thanks to you Mother I have realised it now Shri Mataji: She will have to become a Sahaja Yogi, Catherine a Sahaja yogi she is
Yogi: It's a different case
Shri Mataji: It's a different case altogether a different case, she's not a Sahaja yogini that's the difference. Yogi: It's still the same approach from the man has to apply, it has to be firm.

Shri Mataji: You say whatever you want to say, if he wants to say it and you too must apply the same. Tyrannical

Yogi: You must apply a tyrannical approach to yourself you must be very firm with yourself, so firm that you.....

Shri Mataji: .....................Close the door Shri Mataji: How are you now?
Yogi: Mother said How are you? Yogini: Yes...????

Shri Mataji: So these three principles in your relationships you can achieve only the attitude, only the attitude you are not yet at perfection, but attitude towards yourself because you want to offer yourself to God.

You don't want to offer anything that is not prefect. You see even if you make some embroidery for me, you make it beautiful you want to give something whatever is perfect. Even the small thing that you make to wear you try to make it very very perfect. Now this perfection must be achieved but you have not achieved it. Only thing you can do is to have an attitude towards yourself. Like I have seen I am working on people. How are you feeling? "I am tired". Imagine it's I who is working it out. "I am tired" "I" the whole picture, a very common expression. One should never say what I am, that's the best way. Have you heard me saying that? That now I am not going to do any more.

Yogi: The best you can say to Mother when she says "how are you" is "the Kundalini is working it out" or, It's working or something like that.

Shri Mataji: Well you had better take this, I had better look after myself. This is the way you should say. Mother I will look after myself, alright. One should be ashamed that you are not perfect before me. More worry. But even not that tosay that I am very imperfect and you better cure me. What is........................And the third stage is not only that but to say that I am absolutely imperfect, I am horrible, I am no good, I am rejected by you, you don't love me, and the fourth category is the person who tries to play tricks with me.

Yogi: Sometimes that category will use both of the other 2 as tricks

Shri Mataji: What is it made of?

Yogi: It is very strange Mother.

Yogi: Rose hip? Rose hip, a dried berry which is a dried berry, which is ?? I don't know why by the seasons???
