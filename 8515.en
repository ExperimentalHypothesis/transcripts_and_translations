[missing start].... very anxious that Sahaja Yoga should be established. And the fourth thing he said that there is going to be anniversary, some fourth anniversary or something, of the U.N. And the gentleman who is in charge is that Muller fellow who is already suffering from something, and he will definitely need My help. And he said that they, they are going to have a spiritual dimension to their celebration in which he wants Me to come and give a lecture to them. And also he said I should go to UNESCO and give a lecture there and also I should go to Senegal to give a lecture there and to establish Sahaja Yoga. Though he is a Muslim, he believes in Sahaja Yoga very ardently. So all good things have come out of him. And this gentleman, Mr. Angel, whom I’ve met yesterday was very positive and he said he will try to get also a, our Rustom here with whom he will discuss and other Indians will be discussed, and we’ll be able to find out something very positive because he got a tremendous experience of realization yesterday that he felt the cool breeze and all that, and he is a man of great learning. And I was very happy that he got this realization and he was so good. So it seems that we are now about to take a big leap into a new type of people who will bring Sahaja Yoga to a much wider level, and that is going to help all of us.

At the same time I have to tell you that we all Sahaja Yogis have to understand certain things which are very important. Of course, I was very much pleased with the way you had done this thing and all that. It’s very good. But certain things must be understood very clearly. And one of them was that some people, of course, come to complain to Me also. You must know that, that they said that the charges were rather too much for them, for this programme, and that the food was not sufficient and some of them didn’t get sufficient food. All right, whatever it is. So from next time we have to remember that we must keep charges little lower, try to give sufficient food. Then I discovered that I was rather angry with Christine and I told her that, “How is it that the food was not sufficient?” Then she said it was a caterer. But you don’t have caterers; that’s not proper. We shouldn’t have in Sahaja Yoga any caterers or anything. There are Sahaja Yogis; they should cook. That’s the best way. We are so many of us. And we should not arrange with the caterers because the caterers are, you know, they make their own profits and they are not bothered whether everybody has got food or not. So that should not happen. Next time we should have a more - I mean, actually I could have cooked for you. I’m very good at cooking Myself, but I didn’t know there was a caterer or anything. So, this is what one has to see to it that you should arrange things in such a way.

And then another thing I have decided tomorrow to open an account in My name in one of the banks here. And so that those who have to send money for next year’s programme should send it there directly or they can send it to Christine, and Christine has to send all that and keep a receipt of that and she has to tell Me. This is very important; one must understand. Secondly, I would say that you all should have all the accounts properly written down. That is one of the most important things in Sahaja Yoga. When I asked Christine, “What about the accounts and all that?” she said that there isn’t any system like that existing. I said, “That’s something surprising.” Because in London, though whatever it is, you know that very well, every penny is accounted for. Even I am so meticulous about it that if I borrow even twenty p from you or anything, I return it, see to it, because it haunts Me. And in the same way I think the accounting is very important. One of the reasons why you suffer from money may be that the accounts are not there. Must keep accounts, because I may not see the accounts but I may just have a glance at it and look at it. Actually, I would like to know what sort of money is coming and what sort of money is going. It’s important. Is the Lakshmi tattwa, which you must look after. It’s very important. It’s extremely important. So next time when I come, anything you do, you must have proper accounts. And just to show Me. That’s all. I am not going to deal with it, but I must just see. My glances must be on that, so that if there is any problem of the money it can be solved.

Like, we did, in North America was a big mess, I must say, last time. It was a very, very big mess, and the whole thing took so much of money and the way it was wasted, er, we must, because there was no accounting system. Is Patrick wants to be put to the account system that, “We have to give account to Mother of every pie and everything that is important.” There he could not have run away with all that money. And despite that, he was a bankrupt. Because he didn’t know where he was spending, what he was doing. And if you don’t keep that kind of an accounting, saying that, “This is Mother’s accounts,” you see, what will happen? Money will slip out. You’ll over-spend money. That’s what exactly happened last time. And this time I don’t want it to be repeated. This is God’s money; this is His work. And we have to be very careful with every pie that we have. This is a very important thing which people don’t understand, and I was amazed when Christine told Me she has no accounts of things and amazed how is it. She is the leader of New York and she should have kept it. And I’m really sorry that she had no accounts of anything. It really surprised Me. How could she do like that? And she knows; she has lived in London and she knows what is to be done. This is another thing, because I must tell you all these things, because you should not repeat.

Then another very important thing I must tell you: I felt yesterday while the Puja was on, I tried to raise your Kundalini. A terrible catch of a very worst type on the heart, Vishuddhi, went into the chakra here. Now, that means there were some people who were not fully Sahaja Yogis. So, it should never be done. Even in France, they did the same thing. And I told them, “You shouldn’t get half-hearted people, just who have come for the Puja. If they are friends of somebody or something, Puja, you have to be very, very cautious. Because it gives Me pain.” You don’t want to give Me pain and don’t want to trouble Me, isn’t it? I’ve come here to solve problems, not to get into these. And it was really so painful yesterday, you have no idea. But somehow I managed to take it out. So I would tell you, those people who are not fully realised, who are not in doubtless awareness, you must not have them for Puja. It gives Me trouble or they may go off. There was one fellow, I told him not to come in, in France, and he became crazy. And then he will go to the jail, he will go to the people and say that, “Because of Kundalini jagruti I got it.” But I say to you, awakened Kundalini is not an easy thing. And when everybody’s Kundalini is rising, his Kundalini also may rise, and may have such a problem that we cannot solve it. So you be careful.

First of all, you should be really very, very strict with people that you should say, “You must all become. Unless and until you have become, you cannot come to Puja.” And I tell you, this works much better. Then everybody tries to be that; everybody tries to race themselves. That, it’s a competition, sort of thing, you know, they set into, and they say, “We must do this. Otherwise, how can it be?” So they try to improve. But if you allow right, lovey-dovey style, it goes on like that. It’s not that. And France, it’s one of them, which has suffered so much because of this kind of thing. And I find in France then the wave comes up and suddenly it drops down, again comes up, goes down, because there’re not solid people there. So you have to create really very, very, very, very solid people. That is important, and Puja is only meant for them. Yeah, they may be only five, they could be only ten; doesn’t matter. Not important to have many people for Puja. We can have it for programmes. So remember: I’m telling you very clearly anywhere. You want to have a Puja, supposing now, say, in, er, San Francisco or San Diego, you want to have a Puja, anything of even of the photograph, then please do not admit people to come in who are not realised fully. Remember that. Never get them. You’ll have trouble, your children will have trouble, your husbands will have trouble and their bhoots will get into you. Because they’ll be so frightened as to face it that there could be very serious things happen. So remember my words: do not allow people who are half-hearted, half-baked to come to Sahaja Yoga in a way that is in the inner circle. Sahaja Yoga has three circles, as you know. One is the periphery where people come, go, like that. Second circle is where people come and settle down. And third one where they are settled down. Only the third one can do the Puja. They only have the privilege; it’s a special privilege. Everybody cannot have that privilege. All right?

This is one thing, then. Another thing which really frightened Me was the little child here. He was very badly caught up. And now I don’t know why, but I must say that you must have your vibrations corrected. May be something wrong that how could you not feel the child. Means he would have gone mad the way he was. You don’t know how he was. It was very dangerous. It could be with any other child. Why I am telling it openly? That it could be with any other child that can happen. So be careful about your children. Be very careful. Always feel their vibrations. They, you see, you are just trustees. They are My children. I was so amazed, I tell you. And he is so aware, so intelligent and such a great soul like him. And he was suffering within himself, you see. Not only him; anyone of them could be like that, anyone of the children. He’s just an example. It came to My mind yesterday, and I was really very much upset, very upset, because they are My children, not yours. They are in your trust, and nothing should happen to My children. Otherwise, I’ll take them away. You have to look after them. Keep your vibrations all right. Keep your, all others should say.

Now when the children come to the programme you just feel their vibrations. See how they are. Look after them. It’s not the responsibility of one person. It’s the responsibility of the whole centre. Like, Olympia got lost very much. And I was amazed how she got lost so much. I went to find out what was the reason, how this child got into this thing. To Olympia, is such a great soul, and I gave it to Gavin and Jane. And why this child is lost? Now Jane is gone out there to learn some Sanskrit. There was one lady who tried to be over sort of possessive of Olympia. She ruined her completely. So, but one thing about English is that they all are joined together. All the children are there. They always see them in the programmes. They are all the time there. Even if they are running, jumping or doing anything, even sleeping; doesn’t matter. But they bring the children to the programme. So the children are checked all the time. And they immediately informed Me about this. And we have now arranged her to go to some other place, not with the parents, but she will be staying with somebody else. So there is no more problem. You see, you must know it’s very important. Because of their grace we are getting so many things. They are great souls God has given us. They are great saints God has given us. We have to respect them. We have to allow them to grow in Sahaja Yoga. They should not be denied any opportunity. They should be brought to the programmes, they should be tested by you. They should be looked after. They are in your trust.

So if something happens, say, in San Francisco to children I will definitely catch hold of someone in San Francisco why it has happened to them. All of you are responsible. It’s not only Judy who is responsible for her children, but all of you are responsible for these children. It’s not only that he is responsible for that child, but everybody is responsible for that child. So children are a collective responsibility; this we must understand. Otherwise, we’ll be in trouble because if you do not look after the saints, God is not going to be happy with us. That is very important for all of you to look after the children in such a way that’s a collective responsibility. Every child must be looked after.

Moreover, in England, after all, because I’m there I’m very alert. And sometimes I find it happened even in Switzerland something like that. And I was amazed how one child was so caught up. And then we found that the father was trying to play some tricks with him. And now he might go to jail, his father. But you see, you should be alert. What I am trying to say is you should be all alert about it. This is your responsibility. This is your collective responsibility, and I would say that I will hold all of you responsible if something goes wrong with My children. So be careful. They cannot suffer. They are not to suffer. They have to enjoy life, they have to be happy children and you have to see their needs and things and they are a collective responsibility all of us have got. They are not the children of the parents; you must understand that. They are your children, they are My children, they are everybody’s children, they are people’s children, they are important things. Till they are grown up let them be here. Then we’ll arrange their schools. We’ll look after them. They are very precious things, extremely precious, all right? And this is what I would like to tell you that no child should suffer in My absence. I was quite disturbed because it’s such a great thing, Scott, it’s such a great thing. First day I came here I know. I was so happy to meet him. This is a great personality. But they should not suffer, you know. They will get rid of it but they’ll have to fight it out too much. If you help them, if you are alert, you should see to whom they are talking, what they are doing, where they are going. Keep a watch. Be alert, because everybody is under attack. All the children are under attack. All the satanic forces are there. You must take them to programmes. That’s one thing you must do, because there it cleanses out. You should not be afraid of taking them to; even if they sleep off or anything, doesn’t matter. Take them in sleeping conditions; doesn’t matter. It’s all right. But they should be there. It works out. They should be kept always very alert.

Then the last thing that I have to tell you, that all of you must clear out your vibrations. You all should become really sensitive. You should be able to see how much you have improved in your sensitivity. That’s very important. You cannot play games with yourself. You have to be very sincere. You all should know how far you are, how far you are identified with your Spirit. Is very important. Because you are yourself, you are great seekers, of a very great value, and you should not play about with yourself. Pay full attention to your Spirit. Pay full attention to your sensitivity. How far you are sensitive, how far you can feel others, how far you can understand others. And if there is somebody you find is rather, er, bit too much caught up, just tell Me on the photograph. I’ll look after that person. We’ll try to improve him or improve her. If she does not, then we’ll get rid of her. But don’t get caught up yourself; don’t get into trouble yourself. You are saints. You are great things. You are not to suffer anymore. That’s over now. Let Me suffer for you. You don’t have to suffer at all. So you be careful about yourself. Now know your personality, respect your Spirit and rise in that. And don’t in any way allow yourself to be exploited or to be tortured by anything. Try to rise.

In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, the time as it passes you become matured and matured and matured and, and that’s why we have everywhere, I have appointed somebody as the leader of the thing. One person has to be the leader. I cannot contact all of you, I’ve said many a time. So now as we have one leader of every place, let us have everything done through one leader, because if I have to scold I can only scold one person. That’s Christine in New York. Or I can scold Danny in one place like that, or I can scold some Alexander.

Now, say, in France they created a problem for Me this Jean Francois, you see, he's another mad cap, I should say. I don’t know what to call him. I never said anything to him because I don’t know French language and I don’t know. How will I speak anything to him? He’s just saying that, “Mother said you are a great leader. You are this. You are that.” He’s behaving just like Patrick. Can you imagine? Why will I say to him that, “You are like this”? And if I say, supposing there must be somebody to translate, isn’t it? But he is self-appointed person there. I’m getting news about him. That’s why they decided not to go to Toulouse. But this kind of a nonsense is not going to work out at all. This kind of, you cannot use Sahaja Yoga for money. You cannot use it for power. You can only use it for your ascent. Like some people think, “I’ve become the leader of this.” How can you become? And, “Mother told me.” Of all the things, I don’t know French, a word. I know three, four words. (laughter) And he doesn’t know English. How will I, how will I tell him something which I don’t know, and that nobody knows about I am telling him in privacy or can I talk in privacy French language? Who is from there? From Toulouse? Somebody has come? No.

(Sahaja Yogi: No, no, no, nobody from Toulouse.)

Shri Mataji: You are from Toulouse?

(Sahaja Yogi: No, no.)

(Sahaja Yogini: No, nobody.)

Shri Mataji: Now what do you say of him?

(Sahaja Yogini: It was beautiful because for her it was a big programme, I mean...And)

Shri Mataji: Loudly.

(Sahaja Yogini: Well, it’s some strange thing because I was going big distance because I have many things and because to get here tonight.(not very clear) Because at last tour I was too remembering for (unclear: all I was going to meet) the vibrations (cool). And we have things from Paris, we have things from Toulouse and we didn’t know how to manage and at last, things are at clear tonight. Thank you.)

Shri Mataji: But I made it extremely clear, of course, in English language but I, I made it so very clear that it is Alexander with whom I deal.

(Sahaja Yogini: Yes).

Shri Mataji: What do you say, Marie?

(Marie: It was extremely clear, but somehow he managed to work out the contrary as to what You said, and to tell other people.)

Shri Mataji: I mean, this sort of a thing you should refer back to Me. Thank God it is referred. At least it won’t go too far. Like, Patrick appointed himself, self-appointment, the leader of the North America. Just imagine. And I never knew. Who told him, I don’t know. And how much he troubled Me. So anybody says like that, you refer it to Me. Please refer it to Me, immediately. And understand that these useless, egoistical people are trying to be very funny. Let him do what he likes in Toulouse, but you do exactly what Alexander says, and I’ll see him. I’ll talk to him. He was a headache, in India, was he not? He was a big headache there and suddenly now he becomes a leader. I just don’t know. So please don’t do all these things. Try to keep one person in charge. I appoint somebody by understanding that person. Everything I understand, and then I appoint that person. So don’t challenge Me, please. None of you should do that. I would request you not to do this. So for all practical purposes, all North America should work through Christine. Christine has to inform Me. I cannot telephone to all of you. Otherwise, I’ll become bankrupt. If we have every telephone is one leader, say, then what will happen to Me? So just keep to one person, all right? Is it all right, Steve? Do you understand that? You refer it to Christine, all of you. Refer it to Christine. All right? She is the main person here. And for others who are in their particular places, like you are there in Boston, or somebody is there in Vancouver, like that, in every place you have one person in charge. But let her be in charge of all that. I cannot telephone even to San Francisco, to San Diego. So you must accept it, because she is the one who came all the way from there to start Sahaja Yoga. It is she who started this Sahaja Yoga, isn’t it?

Like they told me that one Mr. Arizono came here and you named the thing at, he has (unclear: named) even today that's how she came here. So I know her. There’s nothing wrong with her. Her vibrations are good. She’s perfectly all right. She’s very sensitive. If I find anything wrong with her I will correct her. Now this is, say, simple plain English language which I have learned. But you do not read into words now, anymore. It is simple as that. I want to make it very clear, because I shouted at her and she was very nervous and she cried and wept and all that; happened. Doesn’t matter. But I’ve shouted at her, because she is responsible. She has to assert herself and she has to see and accounts from Boston or from Vancouver should be brought to My notice. They should be sent to India. I would like to see how you people are managing. So the one account will be for the future plans and one account should be, you should manage ad hoc. Like you want to have a, say, you want to have a programme of your own. For that you want to collect some money; is all right. But one should never start collections. You know, in India. It’s very common in the West. In India nobody does that. Very common; we had a horrible time in London. There was one fellow called Peter Pierce. He came from TM. And when I went away he started a Building Account. I don’t know which building it was. Without the land, without anything, a Building Account. And he had taken one house, that Chelsham Road, and he started. And they collected five thousand pounds, and no-one knows what happened to that account. He took two thousand pounds from My husband. Can you imagine such a thing? And within three months’ time when I was in India. But I don’t know why My husband trusted him so much. Then everybody gave him five thousand pounds and two thousand; seven thousand pounds he had nicely with him, but the result was such that he became bankrupt. And it was such a bad result that the government asked him to get out of the country and he had to leave the country and now he is in Africa in a very, very bad state. Whatever he did for seven thousand pounds has ruined him completely. Imagine; he’s nowhere now. I mean, he is gone away. His wife and children he lost. Everything he lost. And he’s just all alone there in a very bad shape.

I’ve told you that it is God’s money, and these are saints. You cannot collect out of saints something and spend it the way you like. Ravanna used to do that, and you know what happened to Ravanna. So one should never, because I do not take money. That doesn’t mean that anybody should collect money like that; seven thousands pounds. Danny knows all about it. It’s very wrong. You understand that this is God’s work. And you cannot do anything like that. This is very important. Otherwise, money problem will never be solved. It will never be solved. For the time being you might feel, but then everything will be wasted. So be careful on that; be very careful. We have to be honest people. Just now that Doudoudiem was telling Me that in Sudan they are having a shariat that anybody steals even a, say, a fruit, they cut the hands. In Sudan; just imagine. Now we don’t want that kind of a thing to happen here, that people should cut anybody’s hands or anything. But it is a serious thing, because this is God’s money; this is God’s work. Has to be done with that understanding and dedication. Every pie that was collected for even Indian tour was recorded, put into thing, every bit of it.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I’ll just have that little one. All right? And thank you, thank you all.

(Sahaja Yogi: But I think I speak for everyone here that everyone will support Christine. And I would think everyone here feels the same that she’s the ideal choice to be the leader of America, North America.)

Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much, thank you, thank you. And you don’t judge your leaders. Let Me judge them. All right? Just let Me. Try to, try to understand that our, most of the instructions are coming from Me. Because I shout at her and she looks at Me like this. So I said, “What are you doing? Why are you not strong? Handle them properly.” And on the whole, what I am trying to tell you is this way, that this Patrick business came because Christine was just thrown away. She had no idea about it. And he wrote letters to all the people in Europe without consulting Christine. I never knew. When I went there they said, “We have send money to Patrick.” I said, “Why Patrick? And did Christine tell you? “He said, “No”. Then I said, “Why did you send it?” I Myself, I didn’t understand why should he write letters. And when I saw the letter I was amazed. It was horrid. And now what is he? He is hatching the chicken (laughs) in a far-fetched village, far-fetched city, and looking after the chicken farm. Very wrong. One should never do like that. It’s a very big example. You see, because it has happened in your presence now I want to bring it to your notice again, that never do such a thing again, please. And money matters; don’t start your collection suddenly like that and don’t be in this way high-handed. It’s very wrong. Because then you should not blame Me that, “Mother, we did everything for You.” No, no, no, no. Collectivity: one should understand the word, collectivity.

Now, see how we develop cancer. I must tell you, that’s very important. Now how we develop cancer is this way. What happens? That one cell starts thinking because he’s lost connection with the whole. Now this is the centre, and the centre has connection with the right and the left, all right? Now what happens that when the centre is too much used on one side, it may happen that the centre gets separated, or maybe that one cell gets over-excited and thinks, “Oh, I am so great,” and it loses its connection with the whole, with the whole of the spinal chord, and starts working on its own. Then we say it is malignant. It doesn’t observe the main line. You see, what is a leader is nothing but he is in the main line. When it is not good to have a particular one, he’ll be thrown away. I will immediately know whether the messages are carried or not. So somebody in the main line is working it out, all right? Now what is happening that when we start on our own we become malignant and the cancer is caused. This is the point is. And that one has to be very careful, because in the west the ego is so great. To them that to follow one leader means, aah, subordination. It’s not that. It’s a connection with Me. It’s a connection. Now supposing this is connected to the plug. Now I’ll say, “Why to the plug? We’ll plug it somewhere else.” You cannot. The plug is kept there to give the connection to the whole instrument. In the same way, there’s somebody, A, B, C, D. You could be there, you could be there, you could be there, anybody. But somebody has to be the connection. When you break the connection, you break connection with Me. And you become malignant in Sahaja Yoga.

So one should never feel hurt about it. It is very simple to understand that there is nothing to overpower you. You don’t have to leave anything. Only thing you have to be surrendered in the sense you surrender your ego. What do you else you surrender to Me? I don’t take money. I don’t take anything. I give you powers. I do not take away your powers; I give you powers. So what is there that you are going to surrender to Me but your ego? And ego is the one that cuts you out from the mains, believe Me. Ego is the one which is the barrier between you and your heart, between you the brain and the Divine; is a barrier. And this ego should be surrendered. If you surrender that, you’ll be much happier. Do you know, it’s such a headache to have ego in your head. Thank God I don’t have any. Enjoy your egolessness. Enjoy it; that is the best way. Enjoy the good health of egolessness. It’s so wonderful to be egoless. And it’s so innocent; it’s so sweet, you know. It works out so beautifully.

Like today, we went to the shops, and Christine said, “I want to buy a present for Pat because she’s married. We never gave her any present.” She’s a friend of Pat. I said, “All right, I’ll select something. You don’t select.” Went down the shop and we bought something, very simple thing, very simple. Now I didn’t think much. I didn’t do any choice, nothing; just I went and bought something. And when I bought something we brought it home. And you should have seen Pat. She opened it ten times. She saw it; she saw the design. Nothing was there; it’s just a child’s play. But she was feeling that joy, you know. That happened, and it was very innocent, you know. And everybody felt her joy, receiving and also giving. It was beautiful; it was very simple thing. So you don’t have to give something complicated or anything elaborate or expensive, but a simple thing in tune with the person, in tune. That’s the thing which I think I manage very easily, the tuning. And you should also tune with the person. For that you need not be hot-tempered, you need not be over-softy, but you could be in the centre. But you just know what is the thing will tune the fellow. It’s very interesting. They were there; they saw the whole drama. Very simple, it was.

Now it was all that we did was very good, and I met one gentleman when I was waiting for these people to come back. He was an Indian. He said that, “Here people know a lot about You, and You, You had even some lectures here.” I was amazed. He was an Indian, and he said that, “A day will come that there will be many people who will be following You.” Because many people have said that, “She is the only person who is the truth. The rest of them are all false.” I was very happy to know from a Hindu. It was so joy-giving that he said so. And he was very simple. He was not playing any games with Me; just very simple man. And he was telling Me that. And he recognized Me, very surprisingly. It was very, very good thing that just a man on the street, you see, should come and say that to Me. He, he, I don’t even remember him to have come to My programme, nor did he say so. But I think people have started talking about it in the area, and I’m sure it will work out. Another thing that is working is the 'hundred monkey' because I told you many people are feeling the cool breeze coming out of their backs. So Sahaja Yoga is taking a universal nature.

So now again it is for My saints to stand up in their glory, absolutely above all these nonsensical things into a greatness. Now the sweetest thing is that I’ve got candies for My children. You share lots of them, whatever I could lay hand. Where are the candies? (appreciative laughter). I didn’t know candies meant also chocolates. But I thought chocolate is not good for children. But I didn’t know candies meant chocolates. I thought candies means anything that is sweet, yeah. So, now, whatever I could get, I got it and you all are going to have that now. So this is one candy. Come along. All of you should take it together, all of you, and should distribute to everyone. All right? Now, this is another candy. Now keep it all that there. All this is there; let’s put together. Now, this one there. All right. Now, this one there. No, no, no, no, one more, one more. Then we are going to distribute; we are going to distribute. Now bubble gums (big surprised laughter). Now one more. She should have also one. No, we’ll, we’ll give it to all of you. You see, we are all going to open it out and we’ll keep together. And I’ll get you some more. All this and all these.

( child: No, no, no, no, Vimal.)

Shri Mataji: Let them, let him have, let him have. What is there? He’s not going to open it. Let them see. Let her also have some more. Open it and give it to everyone. This is for all of you. Like? He says, say like, whichever you like you take it.

( child: Oh, we got them all.)

Shri Mataji: Everybody should take one each. First of all to one each, all right. Take one each. You like it?

(Sahaja Yogini: He wants to give You some.)

Shri Mataji: Oh, I’ll have one. Thank you.

(Sahaja Yogi: Well, and these are from the children to the elder children. And these I give it to (unclear))

. Shri Mataji: What are these?

(Sahaja Yogini: Hindu sweets.)

(Sahaja Yogi: Mithai hai Ma.)

Shri Mataji: Mithai hai? American style?

(Sahaja Yogis: Yes.)

Shri Mataji: Indian aye kya?

(Sahaja Yogi: Ji, Ma. Ma, barfi hai, ladhu hai, peda hai.)

Shri Mataji: Achcha main balushahi ke tike hai. Ao.

(Sahaja Yogi: Ji, Ma.)

Shri Mataji: That’s all. Let him, let him have. Let him have one bubble gum. You have one bubble gum. Achcha. This one is for Herman and Judy. Come along. I have already given you one which you are carrying.

(Sahaja Yogini: And we have one for You from...)

Shri Mataji: One for Me?

(Sahaja Yogini: From Trinity and from Mira and from Vimal.)

Shri Mataji: No, no, but I’ve already got. You’ve given Me.

(Sahaja Yogini: But this is for You.)

Shri Mataji: Oh, thank you. What’s that?

(Sahaja Yogi: Trinity, Mother, to Your bag [unclear].)

Shri Mataji: Baby Trinity. Now you can have it. You know, you know you have to sing a song to Me yet. All right, today. I’ve not forgotten. What’s that?

(Sahaja Yogini: Gum, gum.)

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

(A child: Harrington.)

Shri Mataji: Look at that one.

(A child: Harrington.)

(Sahaja Yogini: Harrington Bear.)

(Sahaja Yogi: [unclear] has many relations in America.)

Shri Mataji: That. Beautiful piece. Very nice. Like Your Mother’s sari. Like Your Mother’s sari, isn’t it? Beautiful colour.Very nice piece. Because normally you don’t get this, nowadays, colour. Bohod sundar cam. Bohod bari cam. Achcha hai. Aplog hai? [Hindi]. Good. Got sweets? [Hindi] Nahin beta, yeh kya hain?

(Sahaja Yogi: We got every kind which You think of.)

Shri Mataji: Yeh chiije chikki hamare hai?

(Sahaja Yogi: Malum nahin Ma. Ma, yeh peda hai, barfi hai....)

Shri Mataji: Bas, bas, tike. I don’t eat much sweets. In childhood I used to eat. Now I’m a grown-up old lady (laughter). So, Isha, you keep it in this, everything. All right? It was nice. Now, we can have some music because after ten o’clock I don’t think you can have any. Up to eleven. So there’s time; we’ll have some. Now, I won’t eat. Too much for Me, all these sweets. Now, what is, what is this? I must see.

(child: Too much, so all these. What?)

Shri Mataji: Very sweet of him. This is a little thing that he has given.

(child: I have that.)

(another child: [Isha doesn’t want to hear it]. [Wish you] all this?)

Shri Mataji: So very happy. Thank you. Such a nice photograph. Who has done this one? You took it? (?) very beautiful. Have you seen? Very beautiful photograph, that one. I didn’t know he’s such a photographer. Really? Aaaa! Some very beautiful camera.

(A child: Which [flavor], which [flavor]? Any kind of gum. Any kind of gum you can get [unclear]. Wah, I’m putting towards my [unclear].)

Shri Mataji: Why? It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Such a beautiful. It’s a very beautiful thing. I didn’t know she was such a photographer. I think Sahaja Yoga is sort of, gives a very big photographic sense, I think. Because I’m seeing you know, anybody, you see, anyone getting such good photographs, I am amazed. But others, such professionals and all that, they take My photographs; useless.

(Sahaja Yogi: Mother, such a sunshine, You can only be beautiful [only]...)

Shri Mataji: But, but you should see how others get, horrible. But must be something special about you people that you handle this subject like that. Like today, you see, in the shop, the lady said, “Oh, You, You had come with Your husband.” I said, “Which one?” And that was Raja, Rajabhai Modi. I said, “That’s My son. What are you meaning?” Imagine, what age I must have looked. Just imagine. I was wondering what, what camera she must have used to create such a nonsense. Very nice lady, very nice.

(Sahaja Yogi: Camera is Mahamaya.)

(Mother unwraps something)

Shri Mataji: (unclear : Be sure of that.) Lotus in a lotus.

(applause)

( child: Nice thing, that.)

Shri Mataji: Is it American made?

(Christine : I don’t know Mother, I don’t know. (Christine speaks, but muffled, unclear)

Shri Mataji: I see all that. But is it made in America, no? I must see that because... Yes, beautiful. I would like to see what porcelain Americans make. Nothing there. Beautiful porcelain, isn’t it? What an idea. It’s really beautiful porcelain. Because in the shops you don’t find any American porcelain anywhere. It’s all Chinese or something. So I wanted to know. But I didn’t find any American porcelain anywhere. I think they are not very much interested. Nor did I find any crystal, American crystal. I don’t think they make any. Do they?

(Sahaja Yogi (Derek?): I don’t think so, Mother. I think most of Americans buy Waterford crystal, made by the Irish, German, Yugoslav.)

Shri Mataji: They don’t have any crystal, no? And the, and the, this also, this they don’t make. But the, the crockery you use, is from where?

(Sahaja Yogi: Mainly crockery that the most people like is English. There are all kinds of Royal Doulton, all that kind of thing. Americans, there are also some china, but I really don’t know so much of that.)

Shri Mataji: I mean, they never had this in America. So what other hand-made things they do, I mean before they started this? They must be doing some handwork. Woodwork?

(Sahaja Yogi: [unclear])

Shri Mataji: That, that’s all right, that’s, they are not Americans, in a way. But to what handwork they must have done before. [Hindi] Can you say?

(Sahaja Yogi: Just carpenters, Mother. They are good carpenters and they make nice interiors of houses, wood houses, wood floors, cupboards. But they, they made a lot of ....)

Shri Mataji: No, but I mean in decorativeness. What do you say? In decorativeness, what Americans have been making?

(Sahaja Yogi: Sculpture.)

Shri Mataji: Sculptures?

(Sahaja Yogi: Yes, all plastic, Mother.)

(Another Sahaja Yogi: Jewellery.)

Shri Mataji: No, but in olden days they must be making. Jewellery?

(Sahaja Yogi: Jewellery, they are best in the world.)

Shri Mataji: Is it?

(Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother. They are the best in the world, Mother. Their designs are, they have the most designs (Cartier, New York, unclear))

Shri Mataji: Is it?

(Sahaja Yogi: Excellent jewellers.)

Shri Mataji: I didn’t find anywhere.

(Sahaja Yogi: Possibly [unclear]. So I mean...)

(Sahaja Yogini: Mother, we have to go in the market. We have to do the market. It’s not far from the hall.)

Shri Mataji: No, no, what I am saying before all this started.

(Sahaja Yogini: Yes. Beautiful, exquisite [unclear] glass stone You will find there.)

Shri Mataji: Glass made.

(Sahaja Yogini: [unclear] anything and crockery.)

Shri Mataji: Crockery they make? What, which one?

(Sahaja Yogini: They made before.)

Shri Mataji: Before, yeah.

(Sahaja Yogini: And even now there are good potters, but they have a choice between making special things, which they have to get as it is very expensive.)

Shri Mataji: Oh, hand-made must be expensive here, isn’t it?

(Sahaja Yogini: But there isn’t anything like in India or in Mexico where good quality things are available. (unclear))

Shri Mataji: And the weaving they must be doing in the olden days?

(Sahaja Yogini: In America the weaving is very expensive)

Shri Mataji: You remember, Christine, you sent Me one, you’ve seen... But that’s not American? That is Mexican.

(Sahaja Yogini: Yes. Just [sort of] American china. American china and I haven’t mentioned that.)

Shri Mataji: American china is there?

(Sahaja Yogini: [unclear] beautiful in silver.)

Shri Mataji: In silver?

(Sahaja Yogini: Old silver, yes. [unclear])

Shri Mataji: Old silver what?

(Sahaja Yogini: Old silver [unclear] in America [unclear].)

(Another Sahaja Yogini: But there’s no demand for any.)

Shri Mataji: What?

(Sahaja Yogini: There’s no demand for any. The masses don’t demand it so there is no profit in it.)

Shri Mataji: I didn’t follow.

(Sahaja Yogi: Not enough demand for it, Mother, not enough people want it. So they don’t produce too much of it anymore.)

Shri Mataji: What is that?

(Sahaja Yogini: The, you know, aesthetic, [unclear] things like that. The average person simply can’t afford it.)

Shri Mataji: But what is that they produce actually?

(Sahaja Yogini: OK, although they do produce a lot of things [but I think], they do heavy machinery production. And there’s, there’s not much that goes into the household items, so much imported, that is in plastic.)

Shri Mataji: But not on these finer things, I think.

(Sahaja Yogini: If it gets [unclear]. And there’s also lot that can afford it. It really gets [unclear])

Shri Mataji: Only in Toledo I found they were making beautiful glass things, beautiful bells of glass and all that, hand things, hand-made. Toledo

Shri Mataji: Toledo. Tiffan was the name of the place where I went. It’s a village like.

(Sahaja Yogi: Murano.)

Shri Mataji: And I was really surprised how they were moulding into things and beautiful things they were making out of glass. Very nice. Like bangles not there, but something like this kind. So there must have been lots of things of that kind here because industrial development took much late, isn’t it? It came much later in life. So they must have lived with, you see, some sort of plates and things must have had.

(Sahaja Yogini: [unclear] oven and baking)

Shri Mataji: [Havan/Oven] things.

Sahaja Yogini: [unclear] very beautiful.

Shri Mataji: But that, too, was made in Poland. I’ll try next time. It’s like, you know, you want to see something made in America. You don’t find anything. If we’ll...

(Sahaja Yogini: But if we are looking then in the assembly line which is, was the, the exploiter of the mass production.)

(Sahaja Yogi: Plastics.)

(Sahaja Yogini: So we moved away from the er what we would call cottage industry.)

Shri Mataji: No, but sort of, we want to have, say, something made in here. Eh? What she’s saying?

(Sahaja Yogini: They make blue jeans.)

Sahaja Yogi: They make blue jeans.

(Sahaja Yogini: Blue jeans here, blue jeans.)

Shri Mataji: Blue jeans.

(Sahaja Yogi: The American hand-made things.)

Shri Mataji: Blue jeans?

(Sahaja Yogi: The Americans have no taste.)

Shri Mataji: Americans what?

(Sahaja Yogi: They have no taste.)

Shri Mataji: I think they are the greatest. That’s why you are all existing. They buy from all over the world. You don’t know, you get Chinese goods here. Every sort of good you can get in America where you cannot find it anywhere. All the best things there. Have even bought all the old things from all over the world. I mean, they have a good taste, no doubt. They are the ones who got the sense of antiques also. They are the ones who introduced this idea of antique. I wouldn’t say that, but what I am saying that there should be something. Why I am asking you this question is this: everything I say has something behind it.

(Sahaja Yogis: Yes.)

Shri Mataji: Now you tell Me why. Let’s see how far you understand Your Mother.

(Sahaja Yogini: Course we should be, we should be doing something. We should be making handicrafts.)

(Sahaja Yogi: What is needed...)

Shri Mataji: No, no.

(Sahaja Yogini: In America.)

(Sahaja Yogi: To create the beauty.)

Shri Mataji: No, no... Not that. No, no.

(Sahaja Yogi: Some sort of enterprise that Sahaja Yogis can do together? So...)

Shri Mataji: You are very near. You see, why I am saying so... First I was thinking that we’ll come to America. We’ll propagate; it will work out very well, Sahaja Yoga, this, that. But I found the people, you see, they get realisation; then they are finished. They are no more there. They do not take it that seriously. They become frivolous or thing. So how to settle them down? Because the environment is very bad; environment is so bad that everything fizzles out, you see. Everything sort of fritters away. Everything. I mean, the seriousness of it goes away. People just try to play with Sahaja Yoga, little bit here and there. They don’t take it seriously. So I thought of a plan which I’ve told you before also, that in a big land in India I was thinking of starting a school for teaching them Indian crafts. And that for that, whatever you are not making here, we can make there. But now I find that you are making nothing. So...

(laughter)

So I was thinking of inviting people from America to come down there, settle down there for three months and learn a particular craft. We can have about twenty-one crafts I have found out which are very, absolutely very, very Indian crafts and old crafts, and they can be taught very easily. Within three months you can pick up the craft. But by that, learning by that, you won’t be able to do it yourself because it’s a, it’s, er, labour, it’s very expensive here. But what you can do is that, supposing you like something, and now you have, now for example this piece of silk. Now to get it in the market it’s easy that you go and get it. But supposing you know the craft, then you can precisely say what sort of a thing you would like to have to sell it. So you might have something very unique things to suggest. Because Indians whatever they will send you whatever they have. But your style, what you want to have or what is you like, whatever you will be using that only if you know the craft you can... Yes.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, [Radha] was having an idea because there is good leather in India which is imported in form of raw material [unclear]. Theoretically, tradition of leather was here in this country, and there’s definitely a market for it also. That is just an idea.

Shri Mataji: I mean, you want to export.

(Sahaja Yogi: Well, it is not the, it is not the....)

Shri Mataji: You see, all such hand-made things from here cannot fetch you much money because the reason is, it is very expensive. But you can get the cheaper things from other countries, like Taiwan, this, that, is sending to you, but cheapish stuff. But from India you can get genuine, good things.

(Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I am talking about.)

Shri Mataji: Hah. Leather work.

(Sahaja Yogi: Leather work from India, made in USA. For the American market. That’s what I am talking about.)

Shri Mataji: That, yeah, yeah. But that is the taste part of it you can tell us if you know the craft, isn’t it? If you don’t know the craft little bit, at least, you won’t be able to exactly say or design it and say. Another thing says, Indian furniture or something, it’s quite good, hand-made. Now if we send you the parts of the furniture, if you know the craft, you can assemble it. It would be much cheaper to send it here.

(slight gap) ..country, which you can first of all what I would suggest that you must learn the craft, little bit, to understand what can be done. Supposing now this is the thing in pieces. Now you should know in this what we can do, how far can we go, what colours we can use. And then you exactly tell that this is what we have to do. Then the people can do it. Then you can sell them here. But Sahaja Yoga should never be involved with any, any business. I hope it is clear. No business should be done under the name of Sahaja Yoga. Hah, you can have your own cooperative or anything between yourselves, but never, never use Sahaja Yoga, the name, My name or anything for any business. Sahaja Yoga is doing no business at all. But by this kind of a thing we’ll generate a better taste, better aesthetics, better living standards in this country. So I would suggest that when we start this programme, I have to also get one more “Yes” from you, because you are Americans. And I think if that happens I will say that this, My programme, has really reached its climax, because that’s one of the things I wanted to know from you. That when we have that place done, I didn’t want to have it into cement and all that, to make cement houses and all, but I wanted to make it into ethnic style of huts, but comfortable and clean. What do you say?

(Sahaja Yogis: Yes, yes Mother.)

Shri Mataji: That’s good. Then that can be done very easily, very soon. And we can start it this year, of course not, but maybe next year we might start that kind of a school. We have already got teachers, we’ve got everything and we’ve got land also. Can you imagine? And the land will be near some river where you can jump into it every day, every minute. That would be nice near a river. We should have a big place where you all can enjoy yourself. Anything else? Any other suggestion?

(Sahaja Yogini: Cooking classes.)

(another Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Indian cooking. We would like to know Indian cooking.)

Shri Mataji: One of them is that. There are twenty-one crafts. Indian cooking, Indian sewing. Sewing also. Embroidery, then housekeeping. (laughter). Husband management (again big laughter) How Indian women manage their husbands! Without arguing, without fighting. The husbands, just, you see, never allow them to cook. No cooking will be allowed to be learned by men. So the women will know only the cooking and men will have to come home to have their food. (Mother laughs) That’s how we manage our husbands. Best way to manage your husband is through his stomach and tongue. Every man is a child as far as this is concerned.

(Sahaja Yogi: Children marketing, Mother)

Shri Mataji: Children. They are all children as far as food is concerned, you see. So if you know how to make Indian food, I tell you there are so many permutations and combinations that they look forward. You see, every day you don’t have the same stuff in India. The repetition may come after two, three days or maybe after two, three years if you are an expert cook. It’s like that. So... and decorations of the house, everything we’ll have it.

(Sahaja Yogi: Like stone carving.)

Shri Mataji: Stone carving, wood carving, ivory carving and there are other carving also. We have what you call, yes, this is a silversmith, goldsmith, that is there. And also weaving, weaving of different types. What else? There are twenty-one, we found out, which are very easy.

(Sahaja Yogini: What about painting?)

Shri Mataji: Aaaa?

(Sahaja Yogini: What about painting?)

Shri Mataji: Painting.

(Sahaja Yogini: In the village I think it’s called Madhubani, if I’m pronouncing that correctly.)

Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon.

(Sahaja Yogini: Madhubani, [unclear]. I’ve read in a book about a village or area in India where almost all of the women learn painting.)

Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s in the north. Yes, I gave you paintings out of that. You didn’t get the paintings? Those who got married, in their house, there? You have one?

(Sahaja Yogini: We have one, some. You have given Daniel one, I think. We have it, here. I’ll show them.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, I see. We have, the whole village will be doing carving of the wood. Then one village will be doing the inlay work, one village will be doing painting work, like that. We can do that. That’s something very, very remarkable that painting work. Not one village but quite many. Madhubani, Madhubani painting, yes. And then also this, what you call knitting and cane work.

(Sahaja Yogis: Oh, beautiful.)

Shri Mataji: Canework, canework and making mattresses, chatais, what you call, mats, and things like that. Canework; that all can do. Inlay work, inlay work, inlay in wood, inlay in under stone, inlay; all that you can do. Could be many things much many more like the, you see, these things also we make very well, very decorative. Mandapas, we call them. Extremely beautiful, they are. Very well done. Also many things we can learn it. Silver is very, very, but in India they don’t make silver utensils out of sheets. They make out of, what you call them, I don’t know, moulded, moulded one.(I'll have the tea I think. it has gone cold or not?) It is moulded.

(Sahaja Yogi: And wax.)

Shri Mataji: Wax work?

(Sahaja Yogi: And in wax and then they melt it like for the casting.)

Shri Mataji: Casting. And also they do wax work on the saris and clothes. That’s very... what they are called? Batik. They do a batik also on the leather work. Leather work, batik, very beautiful leather. Batik work. But only thing is when you will be there you will be as it is that the American taste, as he’s saying. We’ll have something with the American taste. Then we are very good at doing certain things which are very, very expensive here. Is making frames out of silver, gold, out of, er, horn. Horn, we are very good at horn carvings. Out of horn you can make so many things in India. And then this metal work, brass. All kinds of brass work. Glass work. We have tremendous glass. And I, our crockery also is very good now. Our crockery is now being exported to Russia. And also our crystal. Then we have, what you call, all kinds of glass work; beautiful glass work we have. Beautiful animals and things they make, beautiful.

(Mother is shown something) How did you get it?

(Sahaja Yogini: I don’t know. I just find it somehow and it's there.)

Shri Mataji: (aside) [unclear].

(Sahaja Yogini: Yes.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, they are very different, aren’t they?

(Sahaja Yogini: No, is still here.)

Shri Mataji: It doesn’t want to leave you. Can’t see it. She is still with Me or with you?

(Sahaja Yogini: I don’t find it. Somewhere.)

Shri Mataji: Can’t see it. Then also we have our temples. How we make our temples, it’s very interesting, you know.

(Sahaja Yogi: We remember that, it’s stone carving, Mother.)

Shri Mataji: Stone carving. No, that’s you carve stones. Then the carved stones are put in such a way that the, the complete pillar is made, you see, out of that. But that is also very big art. Sometimes the carved stones are such that you cannot make out whether it is one stone or there are many pieces. Now, great.

(Sahaja Yogi: So we can learn so we can make some temples here, You see.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, you can, you can have. But what I would say that it would be better that you, you learn it and tell them what do you want, you see. Like now we have lot of carving, but say, Greek style. Or something, you have four dimensional things. That they don’t do. You can tell them, “We want four dimensional.” They can do it. Work it out on stone or marble, anything you want to do. And toy making.

(Sahaja Yogini: What about mirror work?)

Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon.

(Sahaja Yogini: Mirror.)

Shri Mataji: Mirror work? Quite a lot. That’s in embroidery and all that. And also...

(Sahaja Yogini: Oh, or I don’t know, elephant and things we can hang on Christmas tree.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. That is, that is made there. That’s quite a lot; that’s quite a lot you can do. Plus you see what they do, it is a mirror work on the clothes and things like that, that also quite a lot. There is the whole country is doing it; the whole country is. You won’t know how, where to stop it. We make beautiful Ganapatis and all other things. Especially from Nagpur from where I come, they make the best Ganapatis. There’s a kind of a, now here this clay that you use so expensive; in India is very cheap. Only thing we do not have proper firing. But we have crockery; we have got, what you call that, er, porcelain, kind of a porcelain, beautiful. And we have ceramics; all these three things we have. But they are to be properly understood in Indian style. It’s very different.

Like I went to Japan. I said, “I want to, I’ve come to see some ceramics.” I went to one place where they were making some ceramics with their hands. So they said, “Here they are all on leave.” I said, “Really? They are on holidays?” They said, “No, no, they have now gone to India to learn ceramics.” So I looked at them (chuckling) I said, “From where do you learn?” Then they told Me the place from where they learn. And that place is so close to My husband’s place. When I went there I went to see that, and it was there. Like that, so many. Because, you see, we haven’t got machinery so we, our hands work out. Kashmir work is, papier-mache work is so much, so much. There’s no end to it. Everything they use it for making. They never allow any lines to go straight. It has to be worked out into something. Out of these also they make ten, ten thing. But you see, that is how one should live with the matter, to make it beautiful, and that can be brought here for no money at all, quite cheaply, compared to these people are making so much money and they have no taste also. So if you can get something like that, you can sell it for a cheap price and people will have better taste to live.

(Sahaja Yogi: There I have been investigating it, the import laws, and they are rather strict in this country. I’m not sure what they would consider, if they would consider things that are in pieces coming from another country [unclear] or not. Certainly four things are heavily tariffed and controlled. So there is, export is high.)

(Sahaja Yogi: Depends of their [unclear], it depends of the hand-made. If hand-made, is a labour by the country which [unclear] no taxes at all.)

Shri Mataji: You see, if it is hand-made in America, no problem.

(Sahaja Yogi: No tariff at all. True.)

Shri Mataji: You see, if it is hand-made, even in England you’ll be surprised, such a conservative country. If it is hand-made, nothing. You see, they want to enrich their country because they don’t have hand-made things. Ha, for other things they do it. Not only that, but anything that is more than hundred years it’s absolutely free of (unclear word). Anything hand-made. You just find out; you’ll be amazed. Otherwise, you will have no hand-made things here. We’ll be all moving in plastic bags. Horrible. Horrible picture. To change all that, to bring in Sahaja Yoga, we have to have natural things, beautiful things around us. And it’s very simple to do, to get all these things here. But also then their taste will develop. People will think more. You see, you have brains, you have better aesthetics and you can suggest better things which Indians may not have. But that you can suggest and get things; knitted, hand-knitted clothes, hand-knitted shirts, hand-knitted things, you can get very well. Cotton, beautiful cotton. Now here you get very good cotton, but that cotton is to be stitched into proper dresses and things.

(Sahaja Yogi: Children’s wear.)

Shri Mataji: Children’s wear? Oh, beautiful children. We have one lady, she’s making such beautiful children’s wear, Mrs. Nigam, but she says, “The market here is so great that we don’t want to export it.” Just imagine. But now supposing, I mean, if there are some people like you help her out, then she might give you something for export. For she makes, she says she has no time. Many people have stopped exporting. The market is so great in India itself. Handicrafts. And you can give lots of suggestions, lots of suggestions. Like, say, now you have got this brass. Now, how to keep it shining all the time? You might be able to give some suggestions also.

(Sahaja Yogi: We have lots of treatments, lots of chemical treatments to make them shine.)

Shri Mataji: Ha, that’s what we don’t have. Also, like, we don’t have good buckles in India, say. Really, we don’t have. We don’t have proper glues in India. And we don’t have zips. You should export your zips from here and get a, get a purse instead. Yes, we don’t have. Many things we don’t have there. Proper, what you call, today, this, Marie showed Me something in which you can fix a picture. That’s such a nice, beautiful, er, latch. We don’t have. In India we don’t have such nice latches. So many things. You can also export from here your taps. But I don’t know; American taps are such that they don’t fit anywhere. Everything is so funny here. Your, er, this thing, electrical is hundred and ten. It doesn’t fit anywhere. Hundred and ten. Everything is like that. You can’t buy anything electrical from here. Your television is different. You cannot use the cameras that you use here.

(Sahaja Yogi: How is the videos?)

Shri Mataji: You cannot use for videos, you see. We cannot use your tape recorders. Nothing electrical we can use. So what a bulk is gone. See, what will you export? I mean, your government is seeing to it that nothing should be exported. What will you export then? Electrical goods are out. Now take another. Your cars: your cars are funny. Nobody wants it, because one reason: they are too big.

(Sahaja Yogini: But [unclear] it started here. I don’t understand how the rest of the world got out of sync (?) are inflexible. These are inflexible [unclear]).

Shri Mataji: That’s the thing with them is, that’s the main thing. It is that they want to do something different. Can I have My sweater please? They always want to do something different. And in doing so, they have alienated themselves, separated themselves from the rest of the world. That’s the point is. They, they just don’t want to do the way others can do. I mean, a simple thing like a sweater, you see. I wanted to buy one for My son-in-law. It’s all funny style. It’s not one that he would wear. Whatever generally people wear is not available here. They were all English. Otherwise, with a neck like that, with a collar like that. (laughter) And the frocks you try to buy for your children, they’ll have all funny things. All is funny things they make. I went to see the socks. Socks are colours like, what you call them, what colours, shocking pink. Now imagine Me wearing a shocking pink.(Laughter) Ha, then we went to buy, I mean it’s like that, went to buy what you call them, goggles. The ladies’ goggles, all of them, are like this. You’ll like a witch, you know. All of them having like this. This is ladies’. All of them had some sort of a white stuff or a golden stuff or anything coming out up to this point. I mean, if you wear, it is for the witches to wear like this. And no Indian woman would wear a thing, I don’t know. What to buy. Then I didn’t buy. Same with the watches. Everything big problem, you know. It’s odd-looking; nothing decent. It’s odd-looking. I mean, simple things like this. What is the?

(Sahaja Yogi: Traditional style. The traditional styles you can’t get. They import them from England and Switzerland.)

Shri Mataji: No, no, all right, I don’t say traditional it should be, but something near decency, isn’t it? Now supposing you have a sweater like this. I mean, you are not some king or someone to walk like that. It looks so funny, na? All funny looking, I mean to say.

(Sahaja Yogi: Mother, and they sell clothes that are already worn out. So when you buy them....)

Shri Mataji: Ha, with holes.

(Sahaja Yogi: Yes. All tears.)

Shri Mataji: It is I can’t understand. Anything that we found that was really something, we can say, it’s traditional or something that anybody can wear decently, was all English, all English or Polish or anything else but American. Either the pants would be baggy or would be so tight that once you wear it you cannot take it out.(laughter) Very difficult. That’s why they have junks here. Nobody can take it and nobody can purchase it. (sips tea) Same with jewellery, I must say. Jewellery is also quite odd, you know. In the ear such big, big things you know, hang from here up to here. There are jewelleries also very funny and queer.

(Sahaja Yogi: The original jewellery they used to make was beautiful and they stopped making it. They import all the stuff now.)

Shri Mataji: I don’t know what to say, but really I feel that people must come to some universal understanding in this country which stands for universality. It’s, is the centre of collectivity. Then you go on seeing people also like that. They become very queer. There’s no universality in them. Somebody will talk like this; another will talk like that. Every time you have to adjust your ears to every person. That’s not good. I mean, if you have to have rapport with the whole world, you must have certain norms, isn’t it? And this country should create norms, on the contrary, I would say.

In these, I think twenty-five years or so, they have deviated so much in individualism (teacup falls over) and all that. It’s too much.

Now this is also a very small cup, American style. It’s all right; doesn’t matter. Can you get something to clean? It’s rather a small cup for a tea. It’s all right. You just bring some cloth. It’s all right. Doesn’t matter. Nothing to be worried. So this is what happens. And one has to bring it to that normalcy. I don’t know when will be they think about it? It’s all right. That’s all right. We just only, you have to use a little wet cloth for this. Because the tea takes, the silk might get it. Just wet, wet it with little bit water. So I would suggest that when you people try to do something, like even having a video now, we had a problem. I said, please try to buy something in which you’ll also have VHS, because now we can’t make for Americans something separate. And you will be missing all the videos.

(Sahaja Yogi: We are, Mother.)

Shri Mataji: You are missing it. Now to get one like that, it’s very cheap here in the market because I know that doesn’t cost. So now if you have to buy any television, buy that one which has got both the, isn’t it? I think this doctor Bhavar bought one.

(Sahaja Yogini: Yes, it is quite [American].)

Shri Mataji: Aaaa?

(Sahaja Yogini: It is quite [unclear].)

Shri Mataji: [unclear], yes.

Sahaja Yogini: And it cost?

Shri Mataji: Three, three hundred, three hundred dollars. Yes. I mean, most of the recording is done by this particular thing. So if you buy that now, I mean, instead of buying anything else.

Can you? No, is it, is it little bit wet? It should be wet.

(Sahaja Yogi: You want some clean, clean water)

Shri Mataji: Yes, water. Little water on it; that’s all. Bring some water on it; that’s all.

If you buy something like that, then wherever we have the films, anywhere in the world, you can see it. Except from America, everybody can see it. Is very big problem. And to adopt anything from this one to yours is very difficult. But more difficult it is from yours to this. Is even more difficult.

(Laughter)

He’s so playful. Let him play, let him play. He’s feeling shy.

(Sahaja Yogini: He’s smiling to us.)

Shri Mataji: Hello, Bhima, I can see you. Aaaaaa. Are, baba, so much problem. Just, just a little wet cloth. It’s too much. Just have it wet cloth. She’s brought it. She knows. Just a wee bit.

(Sahaja Yogini: Here it is wet.)

Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s all right. Anything will do. Just, just a wee bit it stands. It takes out the stain; that’s all. It’s a, you see, always there’s a stain with this. Clean, ha. A bigger cup would be better, not such a small one. You see, normally they use that small one for the coffee, isn’t it? Not in here, America, I don’t know. There, it's faded, already. No, it is, it is little bit already there. You can take it out there. The stain is there also.

(Sahaja Yogi: Mother, that is a half-cup.)

Shri Mataji: Aaaa?

(Sahaja Yogi: It is a half-cup, like a half-truth.)

Shri Mataji: But you don’t have it anywhere in the world, one like that, you see. It’s for a coffee after dinner.

(Sahaja Yogi: Any time.)

Shri Mataji: That’s a wee bit. But for tea they don’t have it. But you see, in America you have to accept everything.

(Sahaja Yogini: Does soap help?)

(another Sahaja Yogini: No, soap doesn’t help.)

(Sahaja Yogi: No, just water, cold water.)

Shri Mataji: Yes. Is done, I think. Is done.

(Sahaja Yogi: Only a little bit there.)

Shri Mataji: And a bit there.

(Sahaja Yogini: Which wants stay there forever.)

(sahaja Yogi. I know

Shri Mataji: Yes, I think so. He is very good at taking. Oh, Danny is another, a real Englishman. He is so resourceful; you have no idea. Oh, he’s extremely resourceful. He is so resourceful and I have to come across another person like him. He’s like Jeeves, you know.(laughter) Leave it to Jeeves; Leave it to Jeeves. Extremely resourceful.

Thank you. He’s very straightforward and very resourceful.

(More tea is offered)

Ha, this is a proper cup. Ha, that’s it. That’s very sweet. Thank you. Thank you, thank you very much. English put the milk first. But that’s not very logical. (laughter) You see, if you put the milk first, then you don’t know how much milk you need, isn’t it? (again laughter) Isn’t it? Not very logical, I think. You must put first the tea and then the milk; you know how much it is to be put. But they are competing with you in everything. Specially now they have produced a special one thing in which they have got the highest marks, is punks. That’s a good idea to keep the left Agnya open like that, eh? That’s a good idea. big laughter.

(Sahaja Yogini: American [missing part].)
