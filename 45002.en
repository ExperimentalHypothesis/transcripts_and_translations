18 April 1999, Puja Talk: Akshaya Tritiya, Mumbai, India

Today is a special day, called as Akshaya Tritiya. Akshaya means something that cannot be destroyed, cannot be changed, that cannot be challenged, and that is the third day of the moon which is tritiya.

It is regarded as the best day to decide, to decide to do something or to have some sort of a determination. This determination is such which will never change, which will never [unclear/differ,] which will not have problems. That’s what it means; today is the day, it’s very important, that we should decide as to something which is very, very firm, which will never be faded.

It’s a very important day and that’s why the Indian people, when they want to take up something, some sort of a challenge, some sort of a precedent, then they decide on this day that: I will do this. And this decision will be absolutely indestructible, will never be challenged. It’s a very good day because we have sometimes so many problems, and we want to overcome them.

At that time, when sometimes our weaknesses, sometimes our tendencies try to – after all, we are human beings, so they try to neutralise, or sometimes try to take us away from reality. But once on that day you decide for something good – to do something, to accept something – that should be absolutely, firmly adhered to. It’s a very good day that we should really stick on. So for Sahaja Yogis, what have we to decide? That is to be seen today what we can decide to do.

Now there are many, we should say, many reactions, permutations on our way, as Sahaj Yogis also, because you have now become one with the all-pervading Power of divine love. And when you have become that, you are the person who is just one with that great Power of God, then you have to decide firstly, that you will always remain connected with that Power, always; that is the supreme Power, that is the Power that [unclear/controls everything], and that is the Power of love.

So, we have to decide that whatever we do, whatever we are trying to achieve, whatever we are trying to make in life begins through love, that gives this determination and this faith should be with you. Through love only we can do, not through hatred, not through violence, not through anger.

Many people believe that it’s not possible, but I personally feel that this Power is the most powerful thing and it is such a, such a energy that it acts. It has computer of its own, I should say; it works so beautifully. If you desire for anything, if you ask for anything, you see if it’s a pure desire, it works. So we have to depend on this Power of all-pervading Power of divine love. And with this love what do we get? We get a kind of an assurance all the time. Now many people tell Me: this miracle took place, that miracle took place, this happened, this has worked. So many people tell Me.

But the main thing behind all of this is this Power that is working it out. It works all the time and it is so competent, it is so fast that, we don’t have to worry about anything. But one thing should be that our desire should be pure. Now what is the pure desire in this, this desire of God Almighty? He has created this universe, He created this world, He created us with the desire to create a beautiful vision of His own. What is His vision is that we should always, all of us, be very happy.

The other day I told in My lecture, as you have heard, that every human being has a Kundalini – that’s the Mother that you have – and everybody’s Kundalini acts the same way, behaves the same way. So to believe that we are different people is wrong; we are all one. But those who believe we are different can be violent, can be very aggressive: can be very destructive also. But with this Power, you can overcome and let them understand that it’s all wrong. We are all one people created by God, we are all in the same pattern, with the same Kundalini, which acts the same way.

Now, if you realise that we are all one and if you understand that we are guided by one Power, you will be amazed how peaceful you will be. All the things are happening in this world just as a drama, and you should see it as a drama, the whole thing, and you will be amazed how your desires and your visions will be fulfilled. Very clearly you will see that and you will be really so much surprised at the whole happening, at the whole becoming, the whole... just appearing before you.

Suddenly you will find everything works out the way you like. This is the day, which is very important I think for everyone, which is promised that, this day or yesterday and whenever you decide that, I will have the use of this divine Power for all the purposes that Almighty desires, will just work. It will work in such a beautiful manner that you will be amazed how these things happen suddenly.

The other day I met a lady and she told Me of lots of miracles that have happened; how she was ill, how she could not get work, how the burglars came in her house and ran away. Apart from that, how her little girl, her child [unclear] and all kinds of things she told Me. So I listened to her, because [unclear] so many things there are. But then I asked her, ‘What do you think of this, first of all, that you have so many miracles compared to other Sahaja Yogis. What is so special?’ She said, ‘Mother, I don’t know how. But I have got a lot of shraddha.’

Shraddha is devotion, devotion without question, is that inner growth within yourself where you become so much dedicated, you enjoy your dedication and enjoy yourself also, the way you are dedicated. This dedication has worked out and this dedication has brought to her all these beautiful experiences in life, and I really thought that must be the reason – shraddha. She said, ‘Only the shraddha that, I can say that I have.’ And I find out some Sahaja Yogis, they don’t have so much shraddha. But some have so much of inner shraddhas that they have told Me that: ‘Miracle has lost its meaning, it has lost its existence: is just for us, has become a natural.’ So, this shraddha has to be seen that it grows within you.

Now you cannot make it grow like you make things and all that. That’s not artificial, it’s real. It’s a real thing which is inborn within you, within us, like a little plant it grows. It grows and grows and grows by itself, through the living process. In the same way this also grows. But what do you do with it? How to make it grow is with your love. You have to respect yourself, you have to love yourself and you have to understand that this body is meant for God's work and once you start looking after your body and looking after yourself in a way that is divine, then it is shraddha, grows just like a plant can grow. But it is a living process and what water you have to give within is that of love.

So to love yourself doesn't mean to be selfish. It by no means it means to be something very special. To love yourself is first of all that you should not allow many of these things to touch you. One of them is ego. If ego is there then you don't love yourself; you love your ego which can be dangerous, which can be [unclear/polluted] and which can be just very aggressive. While if you love yourself, then you don't have ego. You just laugh at yourself sometimes, how it behaves, [unclear] in the company of ego, and you try to just get out of this.

I have seen many people in Sahaja Yoga, once they are in Sahaja Yoga, they say, ‘Mother if we do like this, will our ego grow?’ I said, ‘No, it won’t.’ Don't have these feelings that, if your ego will grow. But you should know one thing for definite that, when ego comes, you’ll behave in a manner which will take away your vibrations, which will take away whatever you have now. And you know it is so good that you can also judge yourself through your vibrations. On your fingertips you will know what you are catching and you are not ashamed to accept that. I have seen many people coming and telling Me, ‘Mother, you know my ego is catching, will You take it out?  I am too much of egotistical.’  You see, anybody who says that can see himself, can see that; it is very clear that he can see himself that this was their ego working.

There are, as they say, there are six enemies you have and all these six enemies can drop out without any difficulty once you start loving yourself. If you are in love with anything, you wouldn't accept anything wrong, anything... this feeling or that, or some other bad thing; you would like to keep it clean. So when you love yourself, you try to keep yourself clean. Clean means absolutely saaf, which is sufi, that they call: Sufi is saaf. So you become clean, you become nirmal. And that’s what is you have to do if you really love yourself and care for yourself.

So on this day you have to decide that, first of all for yourself, you have to ask that you should be clean, you should be absolutely devoid of all the six enemies. Then for others, you have to think of their well-being, by saying that they should also become Sahaja Yogis. Why not? We have entered into the Kingdom of God, why not get others also. Talk to them about it. Manage somehow or other. You can raise Kundalini of all other people and you can make them one with this all-pervading Power where there is no discretion, there’s nothing, and you become absolutely a clean personality with other people being helped.

And it’s such a joy-giving thing to give realisations to others. So whenever you have a chance, you must try to do it. Something that I must tell you that, this love is also universal. I have seen people from Germany especially, who were supposed to be tough people. Most of their forefathers had killed so many people and they are going to all of the places wherever they think they have done something wrong and I was asking them,‘Why are you here?’ They said, ‘Mother, don't You think we have to do something bigger, because our forefathers have been cruel to these people, so we have to correct it.’ See like this, a kind of a feeling comes in that shows that, also your forefathers did all this: ‘So we are responsible now, we should try to neutralise it and to make it different.’

So this love for [unclear] the whole being,within and without. When you see a person, this love gives you a great strength, and a great strength to fight all kinds of odds, I’ll tell you. Because you’ll become a silent person: start watching everybody. Only with that kind of a personality you can fight the evil of the world, otherwise not.

If you are angry, with violence, or try to overpower others, you cannot, because you yourself have taken all the bad things of the other person. So the only attribute should be of love, and see a person with love and this will help clear out, and this is what is today’s great – I should say, a great effect of the divine Power of love.

Whatever has to be done will be done by this Power: you leave it to this, it will do it. If you don't leave it, then what happens, that it says: ‘All right, you want to try it: try.’ In Marathi, they say: [sounds like/ Al kol arisht kubai’]; All right, you have some special connect, all right, you have that: then work it out; and it will allow you to work it out. And you will never work it out. But if you say: ‘All right, I am not going to work it out, you work it out. I have nothing to do with it, you do it. You make everything work,’ so quick, so beautifully, and so marvellously, you should be amazed how it has worked out.

The basic problem is that we don’t understand sometimes, we don’t realise how powerful is this Power. It thinks, it understands, it organises, it cares for you. Above all it loves you. If you can be one with it, you’ll become so sensitive and so much knowledgeable about it. And it gives you that powers we call as [unclear] – cognitive science, they say. But I would say, the science beyond the sciences, the science beyond your mind. And once you have that within you, you will immediately know whatever it knows. And the best part of it is, it is most practical, most practical. It gives you ideas the most practical. I am telling you; you will be amazed to say that, ‘Mother, Sahaja Yoga is very practical.’

It is the Power which you have to realise and know and to have faith in it that, you have created the shraddha, [unclear/ that is the Power that’s going to work out.]

You can call it by any name. You can call it by Paramchaitanya, all-pervading Power of God, or divine love. You can call it as Ruh. You can call it as Brahmachaitanya – all kinds of things have been written. But the main thing is whatever may be the name, it is a Power which is so all-pervading, which has created all this world, everything, it has created us; it has evolved us. Now at this juncture, the time has come for you to feel it. You feel it, and you can feel it all around and it’s so joy-giving. It’s so joy-giving.  So we are not bothered for what others are doing, what others are creating: more problems they are doing.  You leave it to this Power, to this Power which is so powerful, so beautiful and so right.

So today is the day when we have to decide that, I leave everything to this Power. Let us see what it [unclear/has done.] Few people, even if you desire, it will work. It is quite a powerful thing and if you will only ask [unclear/it for it,] it will work. And whatever is good for whatever country, for our world, for human beings, it just works out very smoothly. You shouldn't try to expedite it, you shouldn't try to force it, because it knows.  It knows how it has to – you see, it is [unclear.] You see for example, if you watch a little seed, when it sprouts, how the roots go down. Little root, you know, goes down and down and then it hits the obstruction of a stone. Where does it go? Round; it goes around the stone, so that the stone can be [unclear/ used for its later purpose.] Then it will go again round and round, up to a point where it has to go to stabilise: stabilise that root. So what intelligence it has within a little cell, that is at the tip of the root.

And this is what we have to know, that we have that [unclear/shraddha], which is the tip of the root, you can say. We should just make [unclear] and how to move, because nature is all within the control of this Power. So it doesn’t bother – it is not bothered about anything, [unclear/it just knows, that’s all] how this Power works. Only we have to figure, to decide: only we have to figure out, to decide. And this is the day when we have to decide that, whatever is good for the whole humanity, it should be done through us – you are an instrument, but the Power is in you. You just surrender yourself entirely to this divine Power [unclear/it will all be all right.]

So today is a special work you have to do: we are few people here, I know but if you all decide this, it will all work out in a very, very beautiful manner. May God bless you.

Yogi: We are very fortunate, Shri Mataji, that You have come. We are very fortunate You are here on this day in Bombay.

Shri Mataji: Now it is for you to carry on, this little gathering to a big, you can call, a very big area, where people get enlightened and can receive the blessings of this all-pervading Power, which exists. I have done nothing, I should say, but one thing that, I have told people that this Power is available to everyone. Whether you call yourself anything, this Power is there, is available and can work. And the Kundalini is the one which connects you to this Power. That’s all – it is a very simple thing I have told you. But it has worked: it has worked as you know – for thousands and thousands of people all over the world – because, you see, they never believed that there is such a Power. Even if they believed [unclear], it’s like half and half. But now when you feel it, it’s on your hands: that’s it. [unclear/ Just now, open your hands and see]. You can feel it on your hands, on your fingertips and know what it is: it’s there. [unclear] or you can see the experience of that; just talking is not going to help you. [speaks aside to yogi: All right, we start.]

So this is what is very, very important, that you have to have full faith in the all-pervading, that is God, is there – mentally, physically, emotionally – everything, and that is what will... that will cleanse you, that will cure you, that will give you all the blessings that you want.
