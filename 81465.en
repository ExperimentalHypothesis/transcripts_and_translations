Because, like Matthew said, Mother was just... we were so informal. She was really like a mother. You could ask, "Can you put your hand on my head so that my exams go all right?" And she used to put her hand on you and say, "Yes, don't worry."

On one occasion, when I had my SSC exams—that's called GCSE in this generation—I got an opportunity to give Mother a ring. I rang her up and said, "I've got my exams. I just would like to have your blessings." And Mother said, "Oh, that's fine. Don't worry." And that's it.

Also, in those days, Shri Mataji used to come to all the meetings, like the local meetings we have here now. She attended quite a few—maybe two or three meetings a week. She used to travel and then sit late, until about 11 or 12 o'clock at night, to work on people.

There used to be two rows of people to go to Mother's feet. What used to happen during those days is Mother would just sit, and there was no separation for ladies and men; they would mix. People used to go, and we could put our hands under her feet and take the vibrations, really doing namaskar. It was a lovely experience.

You could feel the vibrations coming from the feet of Mother when you put your hand underneath them. We were so fortunate to have that experience during that time, which people now won't even know about. There used to be Sahaja Yogis standing on both sides, and Mother used to clear the chakras. I have seen the Kundalini rise when people used to go to Mother's feet. If a chakra got caught, you could see the throbbing of the Kundalini on that chakra. You could see it clear out, and then it used to come up to the Sahasrara because that person was at Mother's feet. So we could see the Kundalini rising and coming through. That was a really unforgettable experience, which, of course, people now wouldn't even imagine.

Afterwards, we used to take the bus and go home, but we used to experience all these things. About 30 years ago, I went back to Bombay and decided, "Let me go to this Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan," where Mother used to go. The stage was still there where Mother was sitting. And I said, "Oh, my God, the stage is still there." It's beautiful. It was a lovely experience.

Yeah, but that experience is completely different. It was intertwined, but different. Let Rupert tell you the beginning.

Well, it is. It was pure accident, because I was trying to improve my martial arts...
