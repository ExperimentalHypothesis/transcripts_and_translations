I am sorry there was an accident on the way and it took us so much time that they were delayed and we were also delayed. I hope you will excuse us.

[Shri Mataji explains the bhajan written by Saint Namadeva ‘Nirgunanchi Bheti Aalo Sugunasange’]

“This song, this song is an introduction very much because it’s a song which was created in the sixteenth century by a very famous musician – I should say a very famous poet – called Namadeva. And he was himself a tailor and a Realized soul, a saint. He went to see another Realized soul who was a saint, who was a potter [Gora Kumbhar]. So, when he went and saw [that] this potter was just trying to knead the clay for making the pot. And he was just doing it with his feet. So this great poet stood before him absolutely flabbergasted. And there he says this sentence that “I came to see the formless.” Nirgun [means] formless. “But here I meet the formless in the form of form.” That is sagun [form]. That is nirguna [formless] becoming sagun. Only, only a saint can say this to another person who is a saint. This appreciation of the Divinity of another person is only possible for a saint. There is no jealousy, there no backbiting, nothing. It’s just appreciation of a saint. And he said it in that way. This was in the sixteenth century [that] he made this poem. He was a great poet; he went to Punjab. And Guru Nanaka, another great saint who had combined together so many poems of the saints of that time in the Granth Sahib for the Sikhs. And he is one of them who contributed a lot to that. And his maid [Janabai], domestic lady, also had made poems [sounds like ‘are there’]. Also, he has written a huge, big praise of the formless and the form in a very elaborate and a beautiful poetic way in Punjabi language. That was not his mother tongue. His mother tongue was Marathi. Such remarkable things have happened in that country. But as it is the saints were never accepted. And you know the Gnostics after Christ were tortured by the people who were at the helm of affairs. And so these saints also had to suffer a lot. Doesn’t matter. But they have done a lot for us in our ascent. 

May God bless you.

Let us hear this song, it’s a very special one.

I am sorry for starting the whole program so late.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. As I have told you yesterday, the truth is what it is. You cannot change it, transform it and unfortunately, at this human awareness you cannot know it.

You have heard about the Gnostics who were the first Christians and they had to deal with the people who were at the helm of affairs like Paul. Because they found out that the Christian religion is taking a form which was not what Christ has said. Christ has talked to them – like Thomas, John, Mathews – about the Spirit that ‘you all are to be born again’. But they were not Spirit oriented, they were power oriented at that time and later on they became money oriented. In all the religions as we see today, there is a problem. And thus, all these years they could not find the reality. But even in modern times, there are many saints who are born. Abraham Lincoln was a saint. Even Gorbachev is a saint. Also, we had in our country Mahatma Gandhi who was a saint. Another was the prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri – he was a saint. But they were alone and they had to fight their way through ignorant people. India has been a great country of saints. They are not certified by any temple or church, but they are certified by the people. Mahatma Gandhi spoke about Sahaja Yoga in his lifetime. His secularism was the same as we have in Sahaja Yoga. In his prayers first he used to say let me be born again, let my Spirit manifest. And then the whole theme was to respect all the religions. But not only respect, but also worship all the great prophets and all the great incarnations. Because, if you get your Self Realization you will know the reality that all these religions were flowers from the same tree of spirituality. But today’s situation is that people are fundamentalist in every country, practically. They talk of secularism, but they are absolutely controlling even the politics. This is the reason why people have not been able to come out to find out what is the truth. Whatever these people at the helm of affairs told them, or helm of religion told them, they had to believe in it blindfolded. So, if you ask a Muslim, he will say that Christians are the lost people, they will never go to heaven. But if you ask the Christians, they will say that these Muslims are the worst. But ask the Jews and they will tell you about both of them. So there is a big understanding among themselves that they are the chosen ones and are going to go to heaven. If you are born in one religion, you are supposed to follow that out and out. And all of them have one book as prescribed and they consider it to be the highest and the topmost. It is remarkable how people accept it, [people] who are intelligent, educated, developed. Even if they find out all kinds of things which are done wrongly by the priests, they don’t want to understand that this is not the reality. Despite all these so-called religions, we have had so many problems with the fundamentalists. But some people do see, but they don’t know [that] there is an alternative. There is an alternative – that you are to be born again, that you have to ascend and transcend this human awareness to a higher level. Surprisingly, Gnostics as they were in those days... Thomas also has written a beautiful treatise in Hammadi. Now ‘Gn’ in Gnostic comes from Sanskrit meaning knowledge. And knowledge on your central nervous system, it’s not mental. Also, it should be tangible. It should be scientifically proved, then it is the knowledge. It’s not just sort of a sermon or a lecture or some sort of a mesmerism. One has to understand that our creator is not going to allow this creation to be destroyed. Whatever we may try, it cannot be destroyed. As it is, we are taking to all kinds of destructive ways. But there is within us, built in, this power, you can’t see here [Shri Mataji is looking for the chakra chart], about which they have told you. And the central path of your ascent is absolutely ready to give you your second birth. One may say that Christ didn’t talk about Kundalini. But you must understand [that] at the time of Christ how blind those people were. He could live only four years of public life, at the most, and they crucified Him. Same with Mohammed Sahib – with all these great incarnations, they were not given any chance to say about the complete ascent. I was in England for four years working on seven Sahaja Yogis, so-called. I had given up – I was so fed up with them. They were all from Cambridge, Oxford – over read, over educated – scientists. And arguing all the time. But gradually it worked out. But today the situation is different I think – the seeking is serious and honest.

People are seeking the truth. But what is the truth? The first thing is you should know [that] you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, and this ego. But you are the pure Spirit. And the second truth is that there is an all-pervading Power of divine Love which does all the living work of creating these beautiful flowers and running our heart. Everything that is living is done by this all-pervading power. In Koran they call it Ruh, in the Bible it is the all-pervading Power of God Almighty. And also, in 

Sanskrit language [it is] called as Paramachaitanya. It is the knowledge from the East which some people think is not good. But one has to penetrate into the question [of] why we have grown so big and now we are about to collapse. Why our societies are breaking, families are breaking, children are taking to drugs. Why in affluent countries people are committing suicide. What is the frustration. It is because we do not know why we are on this earth. Because we do not know what is the purpose of our life. Of course science cannot answer these questions, it has its limitations. But there is an answer. As this instrument is connected to the mains, it has some meaning. In the same way, when we are connected to this all-pervading power, we also have a meaning. So the purpose of our life is to enter into the kingdom of God to enjoy His blessings and to live in complete peace, harmony and bliss. 

Now, what happens when this ascent takes place through this power of Kundalini which is placed in this bone called sacrum bone? Now this sacrum bone is sacred and was perhaps discovered by the Greeks because it is a Greek name. But when this power, which is residual, arises then She nourishes all these centers above (six centers) and ultimately pierces through this center which is the fontanelle bone area.

Christ has talked about Mohammed Sahib’s coming. And Mohammed Sahib has talked about the subtle system within, very clearly, in Koran. But as you know how all fundamentalists are, the Moslems took to Sharia. The first five books of the New Testament you know that there is one called [sounds like ‘Jeremiah’] in Hebrew it is [sounds like Yirmeyah’]. In this book He describes... These are the five books also respected by Muslims as Injil. There He describes what happened when Moses came down with the Ten Commandments and He saw all the Jews were indulging into very decadent habits and He knew that this society is going to be destroyed. So He wrote this Sharia. This was given for the Jews. But the Jews don’t follow it, the Muslims follow it. What do you say to that? Nowhere in the Koran is written about Sharia. Also, Koran was written 40 years later than Mohammed Sahib. But still I must say it has certain very good points that it respects the Mother of Christ – Mary. I told yesterday that in the Bible Mr. Paul didn’t want to show any respect to the Mother of Christ because he was a hater of women. I find in the west where there are such developed countries, the women are very insecure. That’s why they take to all kinds of these nonsensical things just to keep the man in his own place. They have to all the time please the men otherwise the man can run away with somebody else. But as it is, the society is not at all worried about what happens to a woman if she is thrown out of the house. I must say in India, thank God, our economics is bad, our politics is bad, but the society is good. If any man tries to trouble his wife, he will be thrown out of the society. And women are respected for their maturity, for their wisdom, for their chastity. But in the west, women are doing all kinds of mad things amounting to prostitution because they are so insecure. There is no respect. And this is the curse I think of Christianity, specially the Catholicism. And the worst I think is the Greek Orthodox – the way they treat their women, unbelievable.

All right, so whatever has happened so far doesn’t matter. You are all seekers of truth and you must have discovered something wrong somewhere, that’s why you are here. I have to tell you [that] it is very simple, that within you is this Power, is your own. And you have all the possibility of getting you second birth, this Yoga, this union. It’s a living process and the last breakthrough of your evolution for which you don’t have to do anything. You don’t have to suffer – this is a nonsensical idea [that you have to suffer]. Why do you have to suffer when your Father is such a compassionate Father? All these ideas are given just to make money, I think. Christ has suffered for us, as they say. So then why should we suffer? Are you going to suffer more than that? But they want us to feel a kind of pity within ourselves. [They] make Christ look like a skeleton. Can a skeleton carry such a big cross over the mountain? So there is no respect also for the greatness of Christ. Now, we have to know that Christ is the path, no doubt. But how He is the path and how He works within us you will know after you have had your Realization. But that does not mean that Mohammed Sahib is in any way less than others. Or also it does not mean that Rama and Krishna were not living identities. Christ has said very clearly that ‘those who are not against Me are with Me’. Who are those? He must have said lots of things, I am sure. But Mr. Paul who just took over and edited the Bible must have missed lots of points. Yesterday I told you he was epileptic. Also, I read a book in which they say he was a homosexual. In Sahaja Yoga we have found out that a person who is epileptic is a possessed person, by some spirit. We have cured epilepsy, so we know. And then he goes to Peter who was the worst disciple of Christ and he says that Peter [sounds like ‘can give lectures’]. While Christ has said that ‘a satan will take you over’ – He must be referring to Mr. Paul. Khalil Gibran has written a big chapter about Paul. Because He [Gibran] was a saint. Anybody who gets Realization can see through – what is the truth and what is the falsehood – because you develop a sense of knowledge of absolute truth. And once you know the absolute truth, there is no quarrel, there is no fighting, there is no questioning, there is nothing like that. And you all are capable of getting it. Actually, you don’t need this lecture also.

I think it is better that we now get to our Self Realization because it is getting late for you and for Me also. I think you all are just ready for it. You have to have complete self-confidence that you all are going to get your Self Realization. So as a result what happens [is] that you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. It is the Ruh, the Paramachaitanya, the all-pervading Power of divine Love. It is fantastic, but it is so; you are all fantastic people. Only thing [is] you have to be connected. So, to start with it, I have to tell you [that] you have to be fully confident. It will take not more than ten minutes for you people to get your Self Realization. And you have to have pure desire to get your Self Realization. It is not meant for idiots and [not clear], or for stupid people, or for [the] arrogant, or for the conditioned. It is meant for people who are open-minded like a scientist and want to have their Self Realization. Yesterday, I must tell you, there were four [or] five people who did not get Realization. And I asked, “Who are these people?” And they gave Me the information that they are from ADFI. I was surprised – how much they are conditioned. You may not be knowing this organization. But I didn’t know they were such conditioned people that they are not open to truth.

So now first condition is that you have to have pure desire and full self-confidence. First is the pure desire and self-confidence. The second one is very simple – is not to feel guilty about anything whatsoever. Now, it is a fashion to feel guilty. I mean, if you understand that you are human beings and human beings can always make mistakes, you are not God. So why should you feel guilty? If you commit mistakes, all right, face it up. But don’t feel guilty because it spoils this center here which is very important. You don’t have to confess. You don’t have to remember what so-called mistakes you have committed. Just forgive yourself and forget the past. It doesn’t exist now anymore. So, the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. Logically. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself. But the worst thing is that when you don’t forgive now, the center which is on the optic chiasma is like this [Shri Mataji demonstrates], very constricted... And if you don’t forgive it won’t open like this. So how will this Kundalini rise? As it is you have tortured yourself all your life and now you don’t want to miss your Self Realization. Please don’t say that you can’t forgive. Only you have to say in your heart that ‘I forgive everyone’ and don’t think about them because it’s a headache to even think about it.

Because it’s headache [Shri Mataji corrects the translator]... I really think I understand Dutch a little bit.

All right. So this is the second condition. And the third one is that you have to know it’s your own power; through your own power you are going to get your Self Realization. It doesn’t depend on anyone. It is built in within you. Like in the seed it is built in to sprout and in the Mother Earth it is built in to sprout. So it is spontaneous; it’s a living process. So you should not take any name, any mantras or prayers – nothing is needed just now. And don’t try to concentrate also. The Kundalini itself will manage everything; just leave it alone. With these three conditions, I have to make one request – those who don’t want to have Self Realization must leave this hall. In any way I cannot force it on you. You have to ask for it. Christ has said, “You have to knock at the door.” So please those who do not want to have can leave the hall. There is no problem at all for you getting the Realization. If you don’t forgive... I think many are not forgiving. So please forgive otherwise this [indicating the Agnya chakra] catches very much. Again and again I would say [that] those who don’t want to have Self Realization should leave this hall. All right.

First we’ll show you how we are going to work out ourselves our Self Realization. First of all, we have to take off our shoes because this Mother Earth gives us a great help of sucking our problems. I hope they are not wearing Dutch shoes or boots. Now, one has to realize that there are two powers of sympathetic working within us – the left and the right – which we can handle ourselves. Left is the power of our desire; the right is the power of our action. So please put both your feet apart from each other and put the left hand towards Me like this [Shri Mataji demonstrates]. This is symbolic that you want to have your Self Realization. It is really great that in a short time you will discover how beautiful you are, how glorious you are. Now you have to use your right hand for nourishing your centers on the left-hand side. So, you first put your right hand on your heart. And here resides the Spirit, the reflection of the God Almighty. And the Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost who is the primordial Mother. Now, if you become the Spirit, you become your own master. So now please take your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here is the center of your mastery created by all the Prophets. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force divine Knowledge on you. Now please take you hand to the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and this is the center of pure Knowledge, pure divine Knowledge. Now raise your right hand again on your upper abdomen on the left-hand side. And now raise your right hand on your heart again. Now take your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and put your head to your right. This center, I have already told you, is in jeopardy when you feel guilty. Also, it causes diseases like Angina, Spondylitis, and lethargic organs. Now please raise your hand on top of your forehead across and slowly put down your head. This is the center for forgiving everyone in general. Now, please take your right hand to the backside of your head and push back your head. Now, without counting your mistakes, without thinking you are guilty, at this center for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the divine Power. Now please stretch your right hand fully. Please put the center of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area and now put down your head. Important it is to press back your fingers so that there is a good pressure on your scalp. Now please move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise. That’s all you have to do.

Now, we have to close our eyes and you need not open them until I tell you. You can take out your spectacles. Now, please put your left hand towards Me and both the feet away from each other. Now, put your right hand on your heart. Now, please close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself three times. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please ask three times: ‘Mother am I the Spirit?’ I have told you that if you are the Spirit, you become your own master, your own guide. So now, please take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard on the left-hand side. Here ask another question three times, very fundamental: ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So please now put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now, you have to say six times because this center has got six petals. Please say six times: ‘Mother, please give me pure Knowledge.’ As soon as you ask for pure Knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So now, we have to open our centers with full self-confidence. Raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Please keep both your feet apart from each other. Now, here you have to say ten times with full confidence: ‘Mother, I am my own master.’ I have already told you [that] the truth is you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are pure Spirit. So now, raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence 12 times: ‘Mother, I am the pure Spirit.’ This all-pervading divine Power is the ocean of compassion and knowledge. Above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you have committed are dissolved completely into this ocean of forgiveness. So forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right. Here again with full confidence you have to say 16 times: ‘Mother, I am not guilty at all.’ It’s very important. I’ve already told you [that] whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you torture yourself. So now at this moment, please raise your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head. And here you have to say with full confidence, in your heart, without counting: ‘Mother, I forgive everyone in general.’ Now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here now, you have to say with full confidence again, not how many times but from your heart, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes: ‘Mother, or divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly.’ Now the last center is very important for which you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area. Here again, I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it. Now, please put down your head properly and press your scalp. Please move your scalp clockwise seven times [while] saying: ‘Mother please give me my Self Realization.’ Not the head, the scalp. Push back your fingers, then only you can do it.

Now please take down your hands. Open your eyes slowly. Please open your eyes. Now, put your hands like this [open towards Shri Mataji] and watch Me without thinking. Now, please put your right hand towards Me and put down your head and see with [the] left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. You shouldn’t put your hand on top of your head but away from it. Some people get much away from the head. Move your hand and see for yourself. Now, please put your left hand towards Me. Again bend your head. Now, see carefully if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Now again, once more the right hand towards Me and see with the left hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. And ask one of these three questions three times: the first one is ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?’. second one is: ‘Mother, is this the al-pervading Power of divine Love?’, the third one is: ‘Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?’ Ask any one of these questions three time from your heart. Now please take down your hands. Put your hands [towards Me] like this. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on these fingertips or on your hands or through your fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands.

The whole of Antwerp. Most of you [have felt it]. You didn’t feel? You are feeling something in your fingertips Madam? Tingling is there? Nothing? All right, we’ll work it out. You also didn’t feel it Sir? All right, we’ll work it out.

All right, thank you very much. I think Belgium seems to be a very spiritual place. Antwerp I’ve been before also. And I’ve also felt this is a very, very spiritual place and it will work out very well here, Sahaja Yoga. Now, it’s a collective happening I must tell you; it is not [an] individual happening. One nail is cut out of your finger, [it] cannot grow. It is a living organism. We are working in 55 nations; you have brothers and sisters everywhere. They are your own. Now you will also understand each other much better and you will enjoy each other’s love and affection which is pure. For this I have to make a request that you please come to the follow-on program. Do not miss out because it should not be like the seeds that are sprouted and are wasted. Please respect your Self Realization. You have to grow, and you’ll have all the powers of giving Realization to others, of curing others, and knowing about others in collective consciousness. It’s so much of knowledge, all available to you without paying a single pie. I am sorry, some people did not feel it. Doesn’t matter. We have Sahaja Yogis here. They can raise their Kundalini and they will feel it immediately. Now, enjoy this peace within yourself and you will know and master everything within one month’s time, for which you can’t pay. I am not for sale. So please try to understand your own value. And it is very important [that] at this juncture a great spiritual evolution or, say, a revolution is taking place. You have to join hands. Your diseases are cured, your metal problems are over, your stress is taken over and you will jump into the ocean of joy. All this is true, but you have to find out about everything that is reality within yourself.

May God bless you.

Next year I will definitely come, no doubt.

These two people didn’t get Realization, they should. I don’t know what is the matter. They did everything properly.

Just put your hands now. Now [you feel it]! You needed My attention specially, I think. Good.

She didn’t? She was writing all the time. What were you writing? All right, doesn’t matter. Put your hands [towards Me].

Madam you didn’t get? You got it.

Just one minute, let’s see. You got it, just see now. You see on her head, you can see yourself. Ask this gentleman to see on her head. She has got it. Certified.

You didn’t get it? Take out your shoes please, one minute. You have to forgive. You didn’t forgive isn’t it? You have to forgive; I can’t forgive for you. You understand? Just forgive and you will get it. Now, better? It’s better now. This was the only point – you had not forgiven. What can I do about it? Just go on forgiving. Tell all the trees that ‘I have forgiven everyone.’ You have so many trees here, beautiful ones. They forgive you. All right.

This is a beautiful country, very beautiful country.

I will take your leave.

May God bless you all. May God bless you all.

Enjoy yourself.
