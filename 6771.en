Sahastrara Puja. Chelsham Road, London (UK), 5 May 1981.

Today is a day, when I should talking about Sahastrara. Because tomorrow is the day of Sahastrara and that is the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga after Christ’s advent. Even if He has sucked your sins, you are to be given realisation. Without realisation it has no meaning and so this Sahaja Yoga which is todays Maha-Yoga came into being (??) you all have to be realised. You have to know yourself. (??) that is the Spirit. That is the only way we can know God. There is no other way that we can know God. We have to be our Spirit.

The second thing that we in all the Christian nations have done is to forget our Spirit. It is a devil catch. If the ego develops, it covers your heart. You can even become emotionless. When it covers your heart, then your heart becomes like a stone and the Spirit does not shine. All the time what you have to say, that ‘I’m the Spirit!’ All the realised souls have to say ‘I’m the Spirit. I’m not this body, not this mind, nor this superego, none of these ‘uphadis’ as the call them’, but I’m the Spirit, the pure Spirit I am. If you could that recognise in you, that you are the Spirit, your realisation will be fully established.

As long as you are identified with other things, this cannot be established. So first and foremost thing you have to recognise that you are the Spirit. You are not the thoughts which are overcrowding you, you are not the fears with which you suffer, you are not the ambitions whit which you run, but you are that pure Spirit, which never changes, which is eternal, which is blissful, which is sat-chit-anand. We all the Sahaja Yogis have to know, that we are the Spirit. This is the mantra, that one hat to recite for heart catch.

If your heart is not clean, you can never get realisation. Anybody who comes with funny ideas about Me you have seen, he never gets realisation. You have to have clean heart. You have to cleanse your heart, that’s why I sometimes say that you have to put your guru into your heart, who will clean your heart. Just to clean your heart, as you employ a maid in the house, to clean your heart you can employ your mother for that purpose. Cleansing is My job, morning till evening I’m cleansing. That’s My name is also. But cleansing is such a big thing, such a big thing that brings forth everything else with it. If there is dust on the (??) on any diamond which will be very expensive, you cannot see it! In the same way if your Spirit is clouded with doubts and fears, cunningness (?), then your Spirit cannot shine. Now, it’s such a vicious circle that it is not easy to break. Even there your mind (??) for Sahaja Yogi it is very easy is to sit before My photograph, put your left hand here and one on your heart and say: I’m the Spirit. Mother, I’m the Spirit.

Can you try that now. Just put it and say it together. The people in the audience say ‘Mother, I’m the Spirit’ trice. And a humbler way could be also: ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ The people in the audience say ‘Mother, am I the Spirit’ trice. Shri Mataji: See now.

Now, Sahastrara braking took place on the 5. may 1970. I was just pushed into it. Then I said one has to now break it. And if you see a very thin line of Kundalini really breaks the Sahastrara through the heart chakra. Here is the heart chakra. Through the heart chakra point only it breaks. If your heart is not clean, it will not break. So the first and the foremost thing is your Shiva Tattwa, is your heart. Heart must be kept absolutely clean. There should be nothing, that is doubting, that is confused, that is angry, that is ambitious, that is afraid of, nothing of that kind should be into the heart. Just be confident. Just leave it into the hands of God. Because that is the point where the Kundalini breaks it and if that point is heavy, you can never break the Sahastrara. Then it happens, it’s such a vicious circle again sets in, those people who have a bad heart, they come to Me and they cannot get their realisation. So they have an additional chance to attack Me by saying: ‘We never got the realisation, we never felt the vibrations, so how is it, that You are this?’ Because already the heart is dirty, you see. It starts there emitting manifesting its Spirit (??) and it goes and adding up and adding up and then they can build up a big story against Me.

But the main thing is you have to come to ask for something so great. You have to be, have a heart which is humble, steadfast and also proud of itself. Because in this heart is the Spirit which is going to be enshrined. But what do I do about your realisation. My heart is very pure, absolute purity. There is not even the slightest ripple of anything else but love for it. Even if I get angry it is out of love. Even if I say something sometimes harsh to you, it is out of love. To keep you out of troubles. But in My heart there is nothing but pure love, pure love. And this pure love is the pure vidya, is the pure knowledge. Is the pure knowledge, is pure vidya. The complete technique of purity it knows. How does the water purify you? Do you know the technique what the water does to you? The complete technique of purity resides in the heart and how do I give you realisation is to put you in My heart. Bathe you there nicely. Have you seen crocodiles? People are laughing. Crocodiles have a very ferocious - but when the have their eggs, they take all the little, little crocodiles in their big mouth and you should see the eyes of the crocodile, there are full of love… People are laughing… at the children (? ambiguous). And the crocodile then put the mouth inside the water and cleanses their… (?)People are laughing. First thing I do is to give you birth in My heart and then cleanse you there in My heart, and then take you through My Sahastrara. I give you your second birth.

Many people ask, that what happens to our karma? I say I cleanse it! It has to be cleansed. So many people have ask one question so many times, that how is it that Kundalini is such a difficult thing and how is it, You can do so well? I think, there must be something special about Me. I did not tell them who I am. If I say Adi Shakti they say some sort of a (??) woman, see who is about to Adi Shakti or else Shakti power itself is horrified and then all talk of that is Adi Shakti. But this is the Adi Shakti of love which is beyond human conception. Only by its power you can recognise it and understand it. How it cleanses you. That’s how people get cured. They don’t know how they get cured. Just with a photograph under your pillow. There is another actress in India who is getting cured. A very famous actress, it’s all cured. Just they can’t understand and they cannot explain. But this is a pure knowledge of cleansing which is built in that photograph, built in! It knows vibrations. It knows everything, the whole technique is built inside. Once you have the vibrations, you don’t have to learn any technique, it works out by itself. It is very subtle. It is complete Brahma Shakti. Is a very powerful, very penetrating, very understanding - but it has all its knowledge built in itself. Is the Shuddha Vidya, is the pure knowledge. When you say Nirmala Vidya is also the same. It is immaculate. It cannot compared with anything. The technique is so perfect, that it never fails. It knows all the permutations and combinations. It knows how to work it out. One has to enter into the kingdom of God to see the working of all these techniques. That is why it was necessary to open the Sahastrara of people. Otherwise everything is Greece and Latin for people who listen to all these great prophets and the great Avataras, they thought they were talking trough their heads. I mean nowadays we talk through our heads only. Because Sahastrara is there and through Sahastrara we hear and we talk. To break the Sahastrara was very important. Of course you were also ready to be saved. The time had come. Mutual understanding was there and it worked out. It’s a tremendous thing that has happened. It should work out in England. I should be here on this day because as I have told you before, England is the heart of the Universe.
