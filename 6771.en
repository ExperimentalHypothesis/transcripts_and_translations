Sahasrara Puja. Chelsham Road, London (UK), 5 May 1981.


After getting realisation, after getting everything what should we have? We should develop faith. Faith in yourself. Faith that you are the spirit, that you have to love and that you have to enlighten others. This way it may close different when you think of what am I the spirit. If you are the spirit then this whole nature is with you. I know of some Sahaj Yogis. One of them was a fisherman. He did sahaj yoga. He had tremendous faith in Me, and somehow he was going to another village to do Sahaj Yoga. When he came out of his little hut, he found it's full of clouds, black clouds.

I am going for Mother's work, and you dare not start raining. You keep as you are hanging there, see I finished my work, you see ................................and other Sahaj Yogis thought what he was talking about. They got into the boat, they reached the other village, he gave realisation to others, and he finished his lecture and everything. He came back on the shore, and when he entered his house, when he was closing the door he said, 'Go ahead'. And he vanished. So the complete faith that this Paramchaitanya is like your servant. Is all the time waiting there to serve you. Whatever you say, we have to, but first you must have complete faith in yourself, that you are a sahaj yogi.

Even now, I find that you people have some lust, some sort of horrible things in them. So first you must establish in dharma. Dharma is known as righteousness. If you are in the righteousness, there is no question. There is no question that this Paramchaitanya won't go to you. But supposing you want today something, and it doesn't work out, then to even get disappointed itself is not very good. Disappointment is also is a sign of your world, immaturity. What is there to be disappointed? Maybe that that was good works.

Supposing I loose my way, I'm going this way, and I loose my way, I don't know where to go, so I get lost, it is all right, where I am I am there. How can I be lost to myself, and then what I find that I had to go that way, because I was to meet somebody, I've been wanting to meet somebody and I met that person there. Funny such thing happens with me and even if don't meet, so what I was to go that side, I had to give vibrations that side, it said that. So once you know that whatever you are doing, you command, we command full faith. Actually the whole authority comes to you through your faith. ......[Inaudible] the truth. The truth gives you the authority, if you have the truth with you, you have the absolute truth with you, then you have authority. And the authority is such that that authorises you not others, but to you. This authority that you have works and works.

[I am concerned about you.]

One has to work very very hard on yourself, is to keep yourself ..... You have to, Inaudible you have to see what your vibrations are? How are you? What have you accomplished? You have ......... problems you have created for yourself. If you were beautiful flowers, I would have done the job myself. But no you have really doing yourself, you have to really clear out yourself, you have to work it out.

You have to clear out yourself; you have to love yourself as you have to love others. Now you have to love yourself, here now come to that point. You have to respect yourself because now this is the chapel of God, you are realised soul. You are a saint, love is, how much I love you. In the same way, you have to love yourself and care for your body. Care for your mind, care for your spirit. Pay attention to your spirit. Is my spirit happy with me? Am I doing what I should have done for my spirit? Or I am doing something for my ego? Or for my superego or for saving some money up out of my food. All these things are to be seen within us. I am not saying for others. I am saying it for individual persons to see what other problems are.

Now even those who are ..........into sahaj yoga and are willing to, must know that they have had very big problems. I have never told that some of you are suffering from cancer, which is settling you your past and I am worried about them. Some of you have serious of such problems, which I have not told you, I am not going to. Some of you have very very serious of problems. You must see all this, you must correct yourself, as I have said that you must love yourself and understand that you are the saint. You just cannot play about with yourself and try to ruin it. Let us not pay any attention to ourself just taking it easy.

It is a precious trust you have with you, because your spirit is enlightened, because you are the light for all the rest of the things of world is walking in the dark. See if you are the light, keep it clean. You are especially Inaudible of this, upon you this great Inaudible has fallen. All this beauty is you going to waste, because your light will not show who you are going to ............ You have to think about it and that's how once you come up at least this much, then one can work it. Keep yourself as you are,

If I have to give explanations, explanations are not here. Who wants explanations here, whom are you giving. I am your Mother, I love you. What explanations are you giving? Even anything little thing happens, I will go out of the way to save you. Even ...in Mother, I still love you. So what explanation can you give? No explanation is needed my children. It has got to yourself...I am concerned about you.

What are you doing to yourself is the main point. And when you understand that Am I the most beautiful representative of Sahaj Yoga? Am I the person who can impress others with my light? Am I looking after my light? Very easy to make out vibration. Your vibrations are proving if you are enlightened. There is a way of finding it out where you are. It is not like other gurus are taking money from you when you are walking in the dark. If you know what chakras are caught, where is the problem, what is happening to you, why it is happening, what are the deities, what mantras have to be said, every thing you know, inspite of that why is it that there is no progress and growth? Because they have no self esteem They have no love, or you are not in the centre. Unless and until you are in the centre, that's what these bhoothas have done and also they have tried to show ......Why are you going to extremes? Leave it to God.

[Mark of the Adi Shakti]

The emblem of the Adi Shakti of course you know is, a thing like this, is or call it a, an elliptical, isn't it. This is elliptical, elliptical, we all know that. But the mark of the Adi Shakti is the half-moon and the star. If you put a half moon and bindi is a point. For the point is the star. So see Islam follows the star, this side and below that is this you call it the moon. But that's the half mudra or we can call it half of the coil. But half according to the western mind half brings it's ...[Inaudible]

But half is the one that that takes everything with you. See the one the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea is always bigger than the sea itself. Yes the half Shakti takes all the shaktis into itself, and this half bindu represents the half. Or you can say the Atma. So is the complete team. The Adi Shakti and the bindu. Inaudible Islam is the sea, and the same way this is the sea, this is the sea of the Adi Shakti is a half circle, is not even half, we should say half first night's moon and a star and why this is used, because this is the thing coming from the creations from the nature. So that also what we call Islam is nothing, but is the creation of Adi Shakti.

[Emblem of Adi Shakti]

Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti and the reflection of Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini. We can say this is the worship of Adi Shakti and the Adi Kundalini. If you understand that all this is created, this entire universe and in many universes is the work of the Adi Shakti. Now many people believe that there is one God. It's true. There is one God. God Almighty. But He has His own powers which he can embody into someone and can get his own manifestation expressed.

So first of all He did was to create the power of Adi Shakti. When it was created then there was a sound. The sound that we call as AUM, logos or anything you call it, by the primordial sound. These three powers came out of that sound is A O. and M. OM. The Adi Shakti is the one who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion and for His own expression, for His own manifestation, for His own reflection. I will say that He must be tired of loneliness, so He must have thought of creating a partner, who will manifest His desires. Thus the power of God Almighty separated from Him and formed an embodiment of His compassion, His desire to create. They say in Sanskrit they use a word "Chitvilas", is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti. Chit is as you know is attention. The attention has his own joy and to manifest that joy of our attention. She created all the universes. She created this mother earth. She created all this nature. She created all the animals. She created all the human beings and She created all the Sahaj Yogis. This is how the whole creation has worked out.
