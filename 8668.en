1986-01-25 Puja in Madras

Please be seated. Madras is known for perfect rituals about puja and that is how in the growth of our awareness even towards God and towards the rituals we have moved from reality. As they say the tree of awareness grows downwards so in the West it grew towards materialism, grew towards something that was filthy went down and down. But as Shri Krishna has said the roots are in your head But in the Hindu religion it didn't go that bad. In other religions it did but not in Hindu religion that bad. What happened in the Hindu religion that it went to the left or to the right. So when it went to the right it went towards the elements of worshipping of elements. That's how they started Vedas. Vedas are like Stuties and Smrities are made to master the elements, to master the elements. How do you master the elements? You can ask the breeze to blow in now you need some breeze, all right have it. you can do the Sun miracles of every kind. You can get the rain if you want all these things could have been done through the Vedas. But the first and forth thing fore foremost thing in the Vedas, is that it should be Vida, Vida is the word, Vida is the main word. Now vida means bodha Bodh means the experience of the central nervous system. It doesn't mean that I give you a big lecture or you read some books, you read Vedas by heart, no. It was meaning that you first become the vidas. vidvanaas, vid, vid means, the bodhas That means the awareness must achieve it's fourth dimension and should, you should become a person with that fourth dimension, achieving the sensation of the All-Pervading power on your central nervous system. This was what Vedas were. But when you have achieved it and then you read the Vedas then you can have power on all the elements. So then now, if you read stuties and smrities, it has a meaning. But to achieve that state first of all, is important. That's why in sahaja yoga we don't deal with Vedas just now. We have to achieve that state, when by reading those Vedas or by saying those mantras we can achieve that state in which automatically, spontaneously you can have power on all the elements. But not with desires, it just works out spontaneously, is a state, is a state of a personality. So, this is how it started. Now, even in the Vedas they wanted to go to the essence of everything. It was not nirakara they talked of but the essence of every chakras. To say that they just talked of nirakara is the way, you don't understand at all Veda. They didn't talk of the formless they talked of the all pervading Power, which is formless. They talked about that part which is the essence of chakras but they didn't want to talk about the Deities. Because when you talk about the Deities then people get stuck with it. Like as I always say that when you talk about the flowers people get stuck to it and they don't seek the nectar, they don't seek the honey. Now, the second part is, if you talk about the honey also you just talk about the honey. It's talk and talk. So you have to become a madhukar, you have to become the bee, to get to that honey. That's the main point. Unless and until you become the bee you cannot get to the honey whether you talk about honey or about flowers. So Vedas also became another talk and after that the horrible thing happened was the Arya Samaj. That's the worst of all. I mean if you meet any Arya Samaji you feel like jumping in the sea, I mean to get rid of him, it's horrible. He talks, talks, talks,talks through his hat, he doesn't know what he's talking and what he is meaning. So this Arya Samaj business came out of the same Veda which is a one side, the right side. So we got stuck on to the right side; the awareness, the tree of awareness got stuck, the leaves caught on to the right side. Like in the West they have got it in the grounds , absolutely into the filth. the dirt of Mooladhara, beyond Mooladhara. But we too have lost ourselves on to the right side and doing all supra conscious nonsense at the time of [UNCLEAR - SHYAMDEV?] that was when Shri Gyaneshwara was there. he was a supra conscious mind person and he tried to show some supra conscious miracles. to Shri Gyaneshwara. Gyaneshwara and his brothers and sisters were sitting on a wall and suddenly the whole wall lifted up and took them from one place to another and this fellow was surprised how on material things how they are working out. because they became first of all realized souls of a very high level. Gyaneshwara was an incarnation and then they had also their mastery over all the five elements. But that is first you go urdhwagami first you achieve your realization, you achieve your state of your realization and then you come down in a way that you go to the right and you can go to the left. But first your doings must be built. This was the state. That's how in our Hindu religion we got stuck upon the right side say mantras, stuties and you are not realized soul, you are not even vidas. Without realization it's like a charpat panjari, as they call it, it's just talking,talking, talking, talking. so that is no use. The second thing was, we got stuck on the left in the sense, where they talked of the Deities we started worshipping Deities, who would worship the Deities. you have no right to worship, you have no passage to them, you have no connection with them. How are you worshipping them? In the air somewhere, they're worshipping, like going to Vitthal mandir in Maharashtra. You see it was alright for Tukarama to worship because they were all realized souls. But these stupid people nowadays, from the villages, they take some Tabacco in the mouth and go on worshipping God in the sense that they go on saying alright Vitthal, Vitthal, Vitthal, all like mad going till they break their necks and when they go there also these,the priests there break their heads actually, just like coconuts. And I have met many who have lost their heads completely. they said we got it through Vitthal.Imagine. Vitthala gave this, Imagine! This is the situation. So we have to realize that we also in our seeking, we got stuck on to the left hand side. But much worse in Madras I've seen a horrid scenes like I saw ladies going round the temple somebody pouring water was so shocked at the cruelty of this kind of a thing. I sat down was wondering, who told them this nonsense? God knows? Then the ritualism was taken over, which was not real rituals because you have not connected by the Brahmins all over India. Now the Brahmins are the ones, who have known the Brahma. You are Brahmins because you know the Brahma. But Brahmins were not to be considered as Brahmins because they are born in a Brahmin family. It was not according to your birth but according to your karmas, is a fact I'll give you an example. Like, once there was a problem, Shankaracharya, so called, raised a Parliament question, you see, that it is written in the Gita that you get your birth prenatal natal or post-natal stuff. In the post-natal condition whatever you are born that is your caste. and so, the Brahmins are the only ones allowed in the temples and so as we are born Brahmins we are the ones allowed in the temples. So that time a person came to ask Me, how to answer this. I said,"very simple". You ask them who wrote Gita? Vyasa. Who was Vyasa? Illegitimate child of a fisher woman. Now, how can he say such a thing? Because he was a Brahmin. It's true, only the Brahmins must be allowed in the temple. But who are the Brahmins is the basic problem. If you are born as a Brahmin, you are not a Brahmin according to Hindu religion. Should not be. You have to know the Brahma. What about Valmiki? He was another fisherman, who became a daaku. He was a dacoit and this dacoit was really a horrible man. But was corrected by Narada, as you know the whole story. So, he is the Valmiki. Now, how does Valmiki becomes a Brahmin? So, how is he the one who wrote Ramayana, who was a dacoit and born of such a low caste. But they will not allow Vaidas and Kabir Das to enter the temples, but these horrible, so called brahmins are sitting there eating the money,that is given to God. So it is necessary for Indian sahaja yogies to understand how we have failed we must know our defects, why we have failed in our pursuit of God? Why there are so many temples? See, many people ask Me Mother, You say, it's a yoga bhumi, it is this that then, why are you so poor? Why such a problem in your country? The reason is we're not yogis Yogakshema vahamamyam if you get the yoga, then He gives you kshema. First you get the yoga then the kshema, without the yoga, there is no kshema. And without the yoga, you are not the Brahmin. That's as simple as that. Even to interpret Shri Krishna you have to be a realized soul. See what He says, three things He has said, Bhakti yoga He says, "Patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam" all these things, I give to you. I take from you, I receive. When it comes to giving, He says, the word ananya bhakti, ananya; means when there not the other. When this happens, He is the diplomat. I want to tell you frankly on your face. Ananya means when you are a yogi, when there is not the other. Then He comes to second point. Gyana He said the first thing.Gyana means bodh bodh marg that is sahaja yoga. Then about karma, right side what does He say? You do all your work and put it at My lotus feet. "Karmanye va dhi karastey phaleshu ma kadachin." Impossible situation. See this is diplomacy Put absurd conditions, which look sensible, but are absurd, so you go on rubbing with that. There are many who tell Me,Mother, we do, all our jobs and put at the Lotus Feet of God. I said, "Really, how do you know that?" Because unless and until you are a realized soul you feel you are doing it but once you're realized soul you said, 'It's going, it's coming, it's happening, not happening, see the point. Now, because of this what happens that people get into a bhrama, into an illusion that we are doing all God's work and putting at His feet, you are not. You are not a realized soul you have to become a third person you have to say, I am giving it. No, it's going, it's coming I goes away. Doesn't work out, it works out. You never say, 'Mother, I can't work out sahaja yoga. I've not heard anybody saying that. They say, Mother, doesn't work out, it works out, it's working.' We start just talking about it all the time, as soon as we become a realized soul. There was a lady, who came with Me to America and she said, Mother, please give realization to my son. He's come all the way from Honolulu, this that. I said, "You give him." I can't. I said then, "How can I?" Then you give him a certificate, he is a realized soul. How can I, it's false? I said that's what it is. It has to happen. You cannot give a false certificate that you are a realized soul, it has to happen. And that is what sahaja yoga is absolutely a shuddh vidya (pure knowledge) and a shuddh thing that in that you have to get realization and establish yourself. So by going to the left-side we got stuck up into the collective subconscious.This side the collective supra conscious that side the collective subconscious. The people who are now in the West have discovered all about the matter and all that has come out of this kind of a venture on the right hand side because God wanted them to know that know the matter that's all, for their convenience, for their comfort, for giving them more time, so that they come to God. But Science moved in a one linear way and has produced atom bombs and everything like rakshasas and now they are waiting for the rakshasas to drop down upon themselves. On the left-hand side now we, now, this is India left hand side is India. We got stuck, we are stucky people. You see, they lost their roots, you can be fool them like anything in as far as religion is concerned. They have no roots at all also because they have gone down so much or there, their roots are lost, they have no roots. They're dangling, you can put them into left or right You know, witchcraft is so much common in America. You can put them into witchcraft, you can put it into any craft you want to you can manage them. or they can go to the right side, they can go to the left side you can create Hitlers out of them, you can created anything what you want because they have become just like bananas, they have no roots. So one side, we got stuck with this too much argumentation, too much of discussion, too much of what you call Philosophy this that, the intellectuals, so called, vidvanas in the Hindu Philosophy, are stupid people. Because they have not got their realization and even to such an extent, now they are saying that Adishankaracharya did not write, Adishankaracharya did not write the Saundarya Lahiri. Intellectuals, you know, they are the great grandfathers of Adi Shankaracharya so they're saying he did not write. Because, how can a Vivek Chudanami, the one he wrote, you see, after that whole thing such a treatise of all Philosophy, how could he write that you must serve the Mother, how can that be? In puja you should sit in right manner. Don't do this, you attention should be towards Me. Alright, so as a result of that what happened that we got lost into intellectual understanding of our Philosophy and for that As Kabir Das has put it "'Padhi, padhi pundit moorakh bhaiye." So they have become stupid fools right side. Left side people got stuck into these rituals so these Brahmins became very powerful so called Brahmins. So much so that in Nasik the Brahmins sent Me word saying that the because You have come from abroad you have to come for your prayaschit to us. Even Gandhiji had to do the prayashchit. I said, "One day you will have to do prayashchit." Such arrogance and such horrid things they're doing. And Kashi Vishweshwara they have got Romans, you see, Roman soldiers. Actually they came to Maharashtra on the Konkan side maybe in Goa or some place, Panaji maybe, and from there they went. Adi Shankaracharya must have thought that in the beginning they were nice people He must have given realization one or two person So he appointed all of them, these Konkanasthas, They are Konkanash
(One Cast of Brahmins in India) into all these places and within two, three generations, two generations, I think, they came in their true colors as Romans. And they're just like cobras, you see, like cobras. And in Kashi Vishweshwara they started using women. They had a one big slippery board and the when women went there, they used to fall down with ornaments, on them Then they would take out all the ornaments, sell these women as prostitutes. That's why in Banaras you have the maximum number of prostitutes. These Brahmins the way they behaved in certain places like, Ranchordas's temple, all the Nath Dwara that was called as haveli, it was a very big case and the main man there, the haveli man, the one who, chief priest, was supposed to used the brides on the first night. I know of so many great women, who have been used by him. All this nonsense started growing in this country like that. So many things, I mean there is no end to it even in Vindhya, Vindhiya Vasini, they did it. Then out of these at the extreme end, started coming the tantrism and the tantrikas discovered a thing that if you can displease the Goddess in any place then that place becomes a vacuum because She's so much there. Once She goes away, the vacuum is created, then use that vacuum for getting all the bhoots there like Kamakhya Devi. There are twenty-eight places where the goddess's body fell down, when you know the Sati, Sati's body fell, She was carried from Daksha, the father by Shiva it fell down on twenty-eight places and when it fell down on twenty-eight places There form a temple, came out of the mother Earth. One of them is Kamakhya Devi that is, I think, in Assam or Bihar some border there. All these temples were used for doing negative things because they did vyabhichara all that in the presence of the goddess, as a result of the goddess, you see, the goddess got angry, She went away from there. Because, you know, supposing you put the filth here, I won't sit here, will I? That's how and then they used that part for mesmerizing and this and that and that's how the tantrism started. As a result of this tantrism just after Adi Shankaracharya's death the tantrikas just came out just like snakes coming out of the grass. And they spread the tantrism right from Konark all through on that whole I should say the whole patta of it, the whole line from there up to Surat, up to down like that the whole of it, they covered. They could not cross into Maharashtra, thank God because Maharashtra is, you have to come up and then go into the plateau so they didn't come. But the whole thing they covered, above the river Narmada, above the river Tapi they covered all that area, Madhya Pradesh, you see, all the Raja, Maharajas all of them were involved. And what they did was to play a trick with the Raja, Maharaja Just because they had Jain, Jain people. as what you call ministers or mantris. And the mantris said that we want to build temples. So these Rajas, Maharajas were all under these tantrikas. So the Raja, Maharajas said, all right. if you can put these erotics outside, I am willing to do. So they said but why do you want to put the erotics. They were very clever people these mantricas. so they said, No. You can put these things outside because that is life. we must show the life and they put in very big, sort what you call the very big competition. They put a very big competition and then that competition they tried to defeat say sort of one, one organization working here in in competition with the another then there should be a defeat and one is defeated, that was not given a chance to produce. So the artist also got involved into it. But still in the, I should say in the, Madhya Pradesh now these places, the artists were still dharmic because they made the all these erotic figures with lanky- panky bodies, you see, and very funny looking bodies like sick people. and the Gods and Goddesses are very thick so you don't see them, I mean, normally you don't see them where are they hanging. And the same architecture because it was in the thing was brought in your country, in your side also, in Madras. And in Madras temples what they did was to put all these erotic outside and they called this is fertility cult, fertility cult. And on your temples if you see these small, small figures they are all those. So how far this negativity has gone to spoil say like if you go. to the temple of, say, Tirupati, Tirupati where sakshat it is, it is there outside, of the temples these Brahmins have put all these things on the door if you see. Imagine to be put erotics! Even in Jaggannath Puri all over they have put these and we don't understand. The Konark temple the whole thing was so horrible because the architect himself was a tantrik. There's no temple, nothing. What he has done he's made all these horrible things and put them in the shape of a temple, there's no temple. And he said that on top of this I want to put one very big magnet so that all the ships will be attracted. So the king agreed to that and he gave lot of money and that is how the Konark temple was built. Now the Nepal temple was built when the artist would not accept this. They have seen, see this is made out of kashtha means out of wood and if the Vishnumaya falls upon it means the lightning then it will be all burnt so best thing is to keep Her attention out. Why not we make some erotics so that She doesn't come because She is a virgin. So, poor artist agreed to it and they made those. But when we Indians go to a temple, we never see this, you see you must have escaped in your temples you must not have seen this. But if you see the foreigners then you will know, where they are, because they have zoom lenses you see. They'll climb over. I've seen in, in Nepal you see they, once I when I went there so Gregoire, I said, "Gregoire where are the erotics sites. I don't see anything where are the erotics?" So, they said, "Oh! You can't see the erotics?" I said, "No." He said, "See those Japanese." The Japanese has had put up, you see, big, big what you call Staircase, which is automatic, 

Yogi: Ladder Ladders but ladders of a very see the ... alertness the ladders but not this like escalator see, they were like escalators, huge big things. They brought all these from Japan and put it up and took the photograph. You see, they were taking photographs. Then I saw all the machinery going on What's that? They said and zoom lenses, you see, big, big lenses. Nonsense. Big. I mean they brought all the machinery all the way. This is what happens. Then we had other religions which tried to, sort of, neutralize it like Jainism that went into another nonsense. Jainism is another nonsense because, you see, at the time of Shri Krishna, Neminath is the one, who opposed, Neminath opposed, Shri Krishna for one thing because He said He believes in hinsa. Because in Gita when they say the Krishna has taught ahinsa I'm surprised. He taught hinsa. You know Karna, when his foot was caught up in the wheel so Karna Arjuna, you see, raised his gandiva on him so,Karna said, "See, you are a veera, I'm a veera." and how can you kill, a nishastra (without any arms) veera See! So then Krishna pointed His finger like this, and He said, "When, where was your veerta, where was your bravery when Draupadi's laaj (chastity) was taken?" He said, "You kill him, now." Where did He teach ahinsa I don't know? Stupidity to think that He teached ahinsa. He preached that who is so ever is dushta, who is wrong should be killed by God. and by the people who are following God. Like Arjuna, the very beginning of it is he went into Kaivalya. He said,"Oh! I don't want to kill anybody, be there's my guru, there's my brother there's my sisters this, that." So Shri Krishna said, "What they are already killed, In the name of dharma you have to kill them." And here these stupid these Jains are looking after the mosquitoes and looking after the bugs. They put some bugs in a hut that's good for the brahmins of course and give some money to the brahmins and the bugs have to take all the blood, eat the blood of the brahmins, and then they give the money to the brahmin. But the worst is you know, now, in Bombay there's a problem because they take all their filth not in the bathroom or anything but they put it on some hill because the kitanoos (germs) must come out, the germs must come out. This is Shwetambaras only but the silliest are the Digambaras You see, they are the worst of it. I mean once what happened that Shri Mahavira was meditating. While coming out his cloth got cut, caught up in one kunja. When his cloth caught up in the kunja what he did was to cut it out, because he thought how to get out so he cut half of his cloth near a half cloth on his body. But then Shri Krishna went just to take his pareeksha (test) and He said, "Now, see, you are a avdhoota, why do you need a cloth upon yourself, I'm a nude person you give Me something?” So he gave Him that. Just for a minute because he was a king's son, he didn't have to do anything and he went back he hid himself and he went back and he wore his dress. Now, these people are horrible like this Mahabali and all that making all the details about it it's horrid, people they're insulting him all the time. But if you see like William Blake, he has made pictures of human beings, not showing any parts other that but in a nude way, when he makes the God or makes anybody Mary or Christ, covers them. Same with Michaelangelo. But I don't understand these horrible Jains. They want to show Gods, as nude and fight for that. The worse is they're fighting, that's the good part so much fighting that. I want to tell you My own experience but it was horrid one day I'll tell you that First time when I saw them they were terrible mess. Alright, so now it has reached such a stage that there is one Parshavnath's thing was found out somewhere, some old statue, so there was a fight going on in the, is the place where Indra was given realization. This place, his chhidra (pierced) was made here that's why we call it chidendra see this chhidra was being here but actually he's Shuchendra, he was made Shuchi. This is at the time of Prahlada that this Indra, when the mother was pregnant, she.. he wanted to help her. So he brought her to Shandilya muni's place. Now this Shandilya muni, Shandilya is My family, My gotra My father's, Shalivahanas, gotra is shandily and he brought that one in Shandilya's ashram. Now the land we have got in Neera is that ashram just imagine sahaja that is the land we have got. And then now it has come out in the newspapers for somebody went and did the research after I purchased the land that this, there was, a meeting between the Neera river and the river some King came all the way here and built that. So imagine, the Shalivahanaas knew the Neera is going to come in them, I'm called as Neera in My family, and on that Neera river, we have got this land. And this also with a very mysterious thing because you see, one man had given this land to the government see and this land I wanted, I liked it. He said, 'The government won't release it, how can You have this land?' I said I want to have this land only people didn't understand why I wanted that land, I insisted Then they said, the government won't release. But suddenly he got a letter one day saying that government think they've taken a surplus land this land is yours. So he sold it to us and that's how we got it. Now Prahlada was born there. He lived there till five years of age and used to go and play there. Then Shandilya muni told Indra that you leave this lady here because out of her will come out Prahlada. He brings forth the promised Narsimha avtara. So you just don't worry and you go South. and there he came and he got the Shuchindra here That's how he got realization. Now this Prahlada went there you know what happened then but here about Peshwai time they tried to build a temple of Narsimha and they spent lot of money to fill up the place and they did it but they could not do much about the temple it was half done. Then one fellow about three hundred years back decided to collect some money to build the temple and he built the temple. In his dream came Prahlada and he told him that I have already made the statue of Narsimha on the river Neera, you go and find it on the bank you'll find. He went there and he saw the statue made out of ordinary sand for so many years it's there. He picked it up brought it and it's back there and it is still there full of vibrations, see the vibrations. We have seen it. And in that temple there is on top of the gopuram you see a little dhara (stream) of water coming all the time. We have so many still, so many miracles in this country but we should go deep into it to find out. instead of that like stupid fools we are just running after these so called brahmins. So the depth and the greatness of what should you say, the Indian seers and the rishis and munis was lost like this by these so called mushroom people. Now it is for Sahaja Yogies who have to find out all these things, put them on record and have to boldly tell them that we have had enough of you now let us take over all the temples. Only the brahmins can enter you are the only brahmins I see Where are the brahmins? Like once in Puna they had a program arranged for in a place called Rajwade karyalaya. This Rajwade is a brahmin and Rajwade was told later on that no no no this Mataji is not a brahmin how can you have it here? So these, the boys never told Me anything they said alright if you say so we won't have the program but we'll have to announce in the newspaper that because She's not a brahmin that's why you're not allowing Her. He said, "No, no that you can't do. He said, "Then what are you to say,what is the reason?" So they got a fright. They said, "Alright, let us have it." So when I was having it, I don't know why,I said, Those who think you are brahmins come here in front of Me." Four five of them came, started shaking like this way. I said, "What's the matter?" They said, "No, we accept You're Shakti, stop it, stop it." I said, "But I'm Shakti nobody is shaking." "No, there are people sitting here, they are also shaking." I said, "Call them." I said , "Go and ask, who are they?" They are certified mad from Thane were sent by the district man. These brahmins got a fright of their life. I said, "That's what you are, you have to go to Thane now, that's the only place for you." And our Rajwade was sitting on top there, all sort of caught up by some sort of an arthritis. I said, "Rajwade, come down now." He 'I'm also a brahmin, he says from I said, "Alright, you come down." Say, "I can't, I can't even walk." I said, "Get up and walk." He's the one who just got up and walked. came down, then he was so good. He started going on a cycle. That time he was sixty five. Everyday he used to go and do work in all the villages, this that I told him, "Stop it now, you shouldn't over do it also, it's too much, he won't stop." And then he started catching from people this, that, he got sick, again I cured him again, I cured him, so many times it happened. But I think ultimately he lost one foot, one foot he's lost, little bit. But that's what it is, so he never listened to Me. What I'm trying to tell you is this this is how our great Hindu or we can say, Hindu word I don't want to use because it has nothing to do with us. This word was given to us by Alexander because he crossed the river Sindh he didn't, couldn't say Sindhu, you see, 'sa' he could not say, so he called it Hindu. Sindhu Hindu, see And then he came down from there and that's how we become Indians, you see. So, they don't know how to pronounce many words, you see, so that's how they couldn't call Bombay, Mumbai. so they use to called it Bombay. See, but Mumbai is a very big word it means primordial Mother. She's the mother of Mumba and Mumba is the mother Amba, is Mumba. And She's the mother of, who is that? That's the Mahakali that's the Primordial Mother. They couldn't pronounce that word so they called it Bombay. That's how we've got Bombay and all those all words were ruined by them. All right! So this is the situation is. Now today's first thing we have to know that we are facing a very great crowds of mudhas, who're stuck up, stuck up there roots are dead and they 're stuck up like dead deep root somewhere. So to shake them is not easy, talk to them is not easy, to convince them is not at all easy because they think see they are all wise, Madrasies think they are the wisest. people as far as religion is concerned and I don't know where to look when they say that. See this is the trouble is. So with that understanding if you face because also, I think, Venugopalan told Me, "Mother, I'm sure it won't happen to the real Tamilians." I said, "Why?" He said, "They're no good, they can never get it, because I'm a Tamilian I know what it is." So I said, "Cannot happen to Tamilians?" He said, "No, because Murthy is not a Tamilian, Jayakar is not a Tamilian. They cannot be Tamilians. " I said, "Let's see the Tamilians also." He just could not think that Tamilians can take to it He said they are so dead into it, they cannot. We have so many now Tamilians also in Delhi but how many come to us, very few. So, Can you open the fan now? You start, who else will start. Can put that also. It's al  right, it won't go. Not so much you can put it little less you see, little movement. You didn't feel the hot, till the electricity had not come. Do you notice that? Didn't feel the hot at all. As soon as the electricity has come you have started feeling hot.

Yogi: Some is not Tulsi. SM: Huh Smelling nice 
Yogi: Which flowers are these? S M: Its Ok All right! There's one thing we are missed on this, which I want to tell you about the Vedas now, as I told you In one lecture you can't cover the whole thing but in short that how they went into the abstraction of the chakras. Some might, might say that they didn't talk about the chakras, you see, because this is what they are it, it's not in the Vedas, it should not be anywhere else. I mean supposing in the beginning that was the situation then today this is the situation. Like, when a electricity started nobody knew much about, it they could hardly put a little flickering light, now today we have this, we have that, we don't refuse this because it was not there so it should not be there You see evolving and it is in aware, our awareness, it is coming. But they will always say, it's not written in that book. Book and that not into that. First time somebody wrote about Kundalini was actually I should say in a real sense of the word wrote properly was Adi Shankaracharya himself and then our, what you call, Gyaneshwara because that was the time and before that of course Markandeya wrote it, thousands of years back but who considered Markandeya as something, no one listened to him. So if the Vedas become everything they will say then what about your chakras, there's nothing in the Vedas. So it could be in some other books. Now Bhrigusamhita has written, Bhrigu has written a book called Nadi Granth, in that he has described complete sahaja yoga. He said that Kundalini will rise and this will happen. So the knowledge of the Kundalini we had since long but it was kept as a secret and was not discussed by the Sushumna people and they are the ones who formed this Machindernath, Gorakhnath all these people. Most of this work was done in Maharashtra. Most of it was done in Maharashtra and that's how we have the Sushumna path in the central path of ascent or realization was kept as a secret and we can say that there were two, two or one or two flowers one or two flowers on the tree of life but now we have many flowers. That's how we can tell. Then the essence how they discussed is that see, what they say "bhu" Bhu is the essence of Mooladhara- made from the Prithvi tattwa. Bhurva is the antriksh. Bhurva is the essence by which it was made the Bhurva. was made the antriksha, means all the elements and all that, is Brahmdeva's job. You call it Brahmdeva or Bhurva is the same, is the shakti of Brahmdeva is Bhurva. So Bhu Bhurva Swaha. the stomach is Swaha The shakti of the stomach is Swaha. Swaha is what to take everything in, burn it, digest it, swaha Then 'Manaha' is the essence of the heart chakra is manaha is mana, is the emotions is the mana, is the Parmesh God's emotions. is in the heart is Jagdamba there. Mana Jana is Shri Krishna, is for the jana. Jana is when Shri Krishna came on this Earth, when He thought of the people. He mixed with the people, He talked to them, He tried to spread and He's the Virata, so He is a collective, He's the collective being - so Jana Tapa, Tapa is Shri Christ because He went into tapaswita. His life was a tapasya, He went into tapa and the last is Satya, at the Sahasrara you know the truth. So all these seven things essence of all the chakras they are describing over here, in the Vedas but these, they will argue, they'll say the mantra of Gayatri, this, that, what is that ? Gayatri is the essence and that's the trouble with them is. By saying these mantras they go to the right side they are not there on the essence. the whole thing get's spoilt. Specially in Kashmir, I must say, they suffer from this Gayatri mantra. And the worst thing, that has happened to us now I don't know about other places but specially in Maharashtra we are two types of horrible Brahmins and there are other very good types of Brahmins also. But the bad ones I'm telling the ones who, who look after the temples and manage the temples and they think, Oh! we know what is God is, there's nothing like or we have made this God, God is all this is just a stone, we know how to manage. it's all Swayambhu and all this nonsense. So they, they are least afraid of God. They do all kinds of things, without being afraid of God because they think there is no God really, it's just a joke so one thing cancel. Second thing is that the people who are sort of educated out of them, they think it's dishonest to say, there is God because there is no God, better to say there is no God. Out of them have come out these Samajwadi's, you see, socialist like Kirloskar, Gorey all these people. They openly say there's no God openly. So that is how it is. Now,we have to understand that we are real Brahmins no doubt, assume your powers. know that you are real brahmins, you are the Brahmins. None of these are brahmin because you know the Brahm, this is the Brahm tattwa, you know how to handle it, you know the vibration. Chaitanya is the Brahm. Of course you are different than them so they are not allowed to enter into any temple, as you are. One day will come when that will happen you'll see that. we have to change the whole system upside down, otherwise things won't work out. The whole system has to be changed but still, because this a yoga bhumi still, you can find the truth in this Motherearth. Saints and saints have born. they have talked about all these things, so there is no chance of abusing anything much, cannot go to Mooladhara of that action that we understand. At least that wisdom we have we, we won't go that side that's the worst of all. Mother: For washing My feet, you do this,
remove it from underneath Now call Madras yogies to wash the feet, Keep water here and recite Ganesha Stotra. Now do this, the one who in going to recite Mantras, will not do that thing, You come here, you understand everything. You recite the Mantra, you recite the Mantra
