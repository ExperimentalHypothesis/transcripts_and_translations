This is the first day of the year of Satya Yuga. Nature will show you that Satya Yuga has started. Sahaja Yoga has brought Satya Yuga. You should have faith in yourself, you have to believe in yourself, you are realised souls. You should have faith in the working of Sahaja Yoga. What works is your enlightened faith. Complete trust should be there. Look at Me, single handed I have spread Sahaja Yoga. Just have faith in Param Chaitanya. If you have any doubts, just ask Me. God is not there but at least I am there to talk to you. Hence Sahaja Yogis should now be free from doubts.
1. Leaders should be very careful. They should become free of all arrogance. They are only a communication link like I have to put a letter in the envelope and post it. They should be careful of possessions.
2. Whenever we are planning something we should keep our attention on the most important thing. You should keep your priorities clear.
3. If there is negativity, you should tell Me, I will work it out.
4. Often organisers get worried about money. In Sahaja Yoga you will always get money but if you worry about money then you will not get it. Money is not so important.
5. We should have wisdom about each other.
6. You should not have any fear. It is all a drama going on, there is nothing to worry. If you say that I am afraid then what am I to say? Even if you make a mistake, you should not mind. If there is something to correct, I will correct it. If you are afraid then your ego will come up, then I will simply pierce it. At least you should not be afraid of Me. We learn from our mistakes. We should not be afraid to make mistakes.
