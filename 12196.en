Today is the first day of Satya Yuga (Age of truth). Nature will tell you that Satya Yuga has started. Sahaja Yoga has brought forth Satya Yuga. You are self-realised, you should have confidence and faith in yourself. You should have faith in the working of Sahaja Yoga. What work is being done in your enlightened faith? There should be complete faith. Look at me. I have spread 
Sahaja Yoga by Myself. Just have faith in 'Param Chaitanya'. If you have any doubt, ask Me. Parmatma (the supreme spirit) is not here right now, however I am here to speak to you. Therefore, sahaj yogis should be doubt free now.
1. The leaders should be very careful. They should be without ego. They are merely a medium to pass on the message just like to post a letter I have to put it into an envelope. They should beware of being master-like.
2. While planning anything, our attention should be on the most important thing. Your priorities should be clear.
3. If there is any negativity, tell Me and I will sort it out.
4. Often, organisers start worrying about money. In Sahaj Yoga, money will always be available. But if you worry about it, then it will not be. Money is not that important.
5. We should use our discretion for each other.
6. You should not have any fear. This is only a play that is going on. There is nothing to worry about. If you say that you are fearful, the what am I to say? If you commit any mistake, even then it doesn't matter. I can say to you that this is wrong and you should not feel bad about it. If there is something to improve, I will improve it. If you are fearful, then your ego will become a hindrance and I will just pierce it. You should not be scared of Me atleast. We learn from our mistakes. We should not be scared of making mistakes.
