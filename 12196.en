Advice Given By H. H. Shri Mataji, Gudi Padwa, March 24, 1993, New Delhi, India.

Synopsis, translated from Hindi
First version:
Today is the first day of Satya Yuga (Age of truth).
Nature will tell you that Satya Yuga has started. Sahaja Yoga has brought forth Satya Yuga. You are self-Realized, you should have confidence and faith in yourself. You should have faith in the working of Sahaja Yoga. What work is being done in your enlightened faith? There should be complete faith. Look at me. I have spread
Sahaja Yoga by Myself. Just have faith in 'Param Chaitanya'. If you have any doubt, ask Me. Paramatma (the Supreme Spirit) is not here right now, however I am here to speak to you. Therefore, sahaj yogis should be doubt free now.
1. The leaders should be very careful. They should be without ego. They are merely a medium to pass on the message just like to post a letter I have to put it into an envelope. They should beware of being master-like.
2. While planning anything, our attention should be on the most important thing. Your priorities should be clear.
3. If there is any negativity, tell Me and I will sort it out.
4. Often, organisers start worrying about money. In Sahaj Yoga, money will always be available. But if you worry about it, then it will not be. Money is not that important.
5. We should use our discretion for each other.
6. You should not have any fear. This is only a play that is going on. There is nothing to worry about. If you say that you are fearful, then what am I to say? If you commit any mistake, even then it doesn't matter. I can say to you that this is wrong and you should not feel bad about it. If there is something to improve, I will improve it. If you are fearful, then your ego will become a hindrance and I will just pierce it. You should not be scared of Me, at least. We learn from our mistakes. We should not be scared of making mistakes.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

Second version:
This is the first day of the year of Satya Yuga. Nature will show you that Satya Yuga has started. Sahaja Yoga has brought Satya Yuga. You should have faith in yourself, you have to believe in yourself, you are Realized souls. You should have faith in the working of Sahaja Yoga. What works is your enlightened faith. Complete trust should be there. Look at Me, single handed I have spread Sahaja Yoga. Just have faith in Param Chaitanya. If you have any doubts, just ask Me. God is not there but at least I am there to talk to you. Hence Sahaja Yogis should now be free from doubts.

1. Leaders should be very careful. They should become free of all arrogance. They are only a communication link like I have to put a letter in the envelope and post it. They should be careful of possessions.
2. Whenever we are planning something we should keep our attention on the most
important thing. You should keep your priorities clear.
3. If there is negativity, you should tell Me, I will work it out.
4. Often organisers get worried about money. In Sahaja Yoga you will always get money but if you worry about money then you will not get it. Money is not so important.
5. We should have wisdom about each other.
6. You should not have any fear. It is all a drama going on, there is nothing to worry. If you say that I am afraid then what am I to say? Even if you make a mistake, you should not mind. If there is something to correct, I will correct it. If you are afraid then your ego will come up, then I will simply pierce it. At least you should not be afraid of Me. We learn from our mistakes. We should not be afraid to make mistakes.
