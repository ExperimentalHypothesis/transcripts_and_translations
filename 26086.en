Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Perth Ashram, Australia. 04-03-1990

So for all the Sahaja Yogis from Perth, I must say all the Indian Sahaja Yogis have sent their love and are sorry that they could not come here, though the musicians would be coming other side of Australia. But in any case I will give them the good news that you have already become musicians. Now coming back to the basics in Sahaja Yoga, we have to know that in Sahaja Yoga we have no hard and fast rules for anything because you are awakened people; you are saints, you know what is good for you. But you must keep that quality of saintliness within you. And certain things you should avoid yourself if possible and if not then see what’s wrong with your centres. If something's wrong with your centres you start getting into problems, getting into ideas, something’s which are destructive. So best is to judge yourself first of all, how are your vibrations. Now the best part that has happened so far I think is that the Perth (inaudible) is happy and they have assured me that they will try and get a big ashram. Because yesterday you saw how many people were there, day before you saw how many people were there. Now if you have to help somebody in such a big way then we have to have a big ashram, a big place where people can come. Now found out a suggestion another one if you can accept it, that first of all you can have a big ashram somewhere which is to be renovated. And all of you try to renovate it.  It’s not difficult as he said that you can purchase some dilapidated thing and as we have in Sahaja Yoga mostly people come dilapidated, isn't it?, and then we put them right. In the same way we have to rebuild the whole thing, renovate the whole thing, a big thing. And he says that he can get a loan for that, for renovation, which you can pay as a rent and can be looked after and also the people who are coming from outside you can tell them that this is not for Sahaja Yoga but for this hall that we have here, a bigger place. That little bit money should be paid and they wouldn't mind paying you some money. But not for Sahaja Yoga, it’s just for that gradually you should introduce these ideas to them will be a very good thing.

Now collectivity should grow. And collectivity grows with certain other subtler ideas that we should have for collectivity. First of all we are all saints , aren't we?, so now we cannot talk ill of each other; we cannot talk if we are thinking ill of somebody or criticizing somebody then we must know that there's something wrong with us. In Sahaja Yoga we should not criticize anybody; we should see the beauty, the glory of another person; and praise the joy that you have and the happiness that you have, because if you want to gather the thorns you will get thorns, you can't get flowers. But if you want to gather flowers you will get flowers. So nobody should talk ill of others because that is one thing that is a problem in Sahaja Yoga. Secondly there's a leader wing. Now there a leader in this you find something wrong with him then you directly tell me. Don't discuss among yourselves and create a group against him/her. Because through him/her only I can talk to you or come to you. Now supposing there's something wrong, you can telephone me or trump call to me, if things are too dangerous something (inaudible), it's all right, doesn't matter. I can talk to that person, I will ask the whole thing and we can manage. There's nothing wrong with it. I mean after all you are the part and parcel of the whole, but every moment if you go on standing and fighting with the person or trying to do something that will harm the basic unity then it's very wrong. And that is one of the responsibilities that you have that whatever you think, there's something to be done or suggestions, you can give it to the leader. And if you think there's something very wrong in the leadership or in certain decisions he/she has taken then you are open to write to me absolutely. you can telephone to me, all these letters pass through proper ways and every letter is sort of found out to be in a way whatever is needed to be given to me they give me, otherwise also they mark it that Mother this is the point that the letter has. And the letters which do not require any sort of answering we don't answer; but the answer comes somehow though. supposing you have a problem, the problem can be solved and all that; so there's no need to write various things , like sometimes from Australia a letter comes, could be 10-20 pages. First of all it costs so much money to you; secondly the people in England become suspicious, not the Sahaja Yogis, the post people, they think what's going here? Some sort of politics. So there's no need to write long letters, just few things of how you are and how you are enjoying Sahaja Yoga. And sometimes from America, the Thanksgiving Day, they wrote such sweet sweet things only one sentence but such beautiful things that really I couldn't get over it for ages.  I said oh God! have I done so much as they have respected, very deep and subtle. So the subtler you become the less you talk, the less you tell things, the less you write. As you know in Zen system, you write very small sentences; and in that small sentences they say such deep and subtle things. So there is a record on a subtler level not on a superficial level.

Thirdly I would say there’s also a tendency among so many people, like Harsh was with me or somebody is with me closer, but he is not the leader you see, so they tell him Harsh go and tell Mother like this, please tell Mother and he got fed up and he said I am not the channel. Leader is the channel and why don’t you tell the leader? Whatever you want you tell the leader and the leader can tell can tell Mother; not me, nothing doing. Then he got really mad because everybody started telling him tell this to Mother, tell this to her. He would not tell me anything. He said I am not telling her anything, what’s the use of telling me? So you should not find out any other channel. Your leader is there and he can decide. Now the point that he has brought out now that about marriages.

Normally, now there’s no hard and fast rule as I said, normally it’s better to marry a person no from the same place or not from the same collectivity. Now the reason why, now in India supposing there’s a village, from a village they don’t marry in the same village or long time back it was not from the same university, they would not marry. Even today, the one who belongs to a particular university is called as a ‘Gotra’. See my gotra is ‘Shandilya’ gotra so I cannot marry in the shandilya. Now this was thousands of year back see our forefathers must have studied in that particular university of the Shandilya University but even till today I cannot marry somebody belonging to the same shandilya university; I mean it’s so farfetched. But the reason was that in the colleges or in the universities a relation should be there of complete celibacy and purity. That purity gets spoiled. Supposing you want to marry somebody in the same area is alright you can marry, but it should not be a common rule. Because then the purity cannot be maintained. You will be looking out for a girl in the same area where you belong and there what happens is some minds will lose their innocence. Mooladhara might be caught up. So it should be that you marry outside. So at least the purity of this place is kept. You are all brothers and sisters but if there’s somebody who really thinks that it’s important to marry and they want to marry someone, there’s no hard and fast rule so it’s alright but normally it should not be. It should not be a normal thing because then you start seeking out girls and all the time looking at girls with this idea whom should I marry, whom should I choose; in the beginning we had these things, Lot of these things in India, this problem and it was such a problem and mostly such marriages have turned out to be very funny, it’s very very funny. We had very big mishap in Austria. There was a girl who wanted to marry someone. I said alright, it’s this I can’t force anything like that but since you both are Sahaja yogis. And then that girl fell in love with another Sahaja yogi and quit another and she became pregnant with another man while this Sahaja yogi had gone out. Such a problem I didn’t know what to do with her. I just don’t know. Then this Sahaja yogi, the first one, her husband, refused to have her. Then another Sahaja yogi would not say that that is his child and a big problem came too. Because this girl lost her sense you see. She went from one boy to another because if you go on like that there’s no end to it. And it was a big problem, still it exists there. But now she’s left high and dry because there’s none who’s with her. So first of all we should not pay so much attention to this, it’s not so important in Sahaja yoga but the most important thing is that you try to keep yourself pure; your vibrations alright, no problems. And also if you, any Sahaja yogi want’s to have a relationship outside Sahaja yoga, one has to be very careful. Because we don’t know what sort of Mooladhara they have; what kind of problems they have. You might jump into something serious and then you come back with a very serious problem telling me, Mother, we had such problems. He knows very well even in Australia that somebody went with somebody else and she developed a herpes. And now it’s difficult to marry her. So in Sahaja yoga we have to understand that marriage is all respected it has to be, but it has to be monogamous. We cannot have monoandrous and monogamous (unclear). We don’t believe in marrying one man, living with another man, running after third man. Because you see what I have been saying is coming true. Now people have AIDS, people have all kinds of disease. Now in America also they think that monogamy is the best. And after all it is not natural. Because supposing a man is married to a lady then the lady wants that the man should be in her privacy should be hers and also the man wants the same. If it is not so they feel jealous. They are not happy. That’s one of the symptoms that if the person is not happy with this kind of thing then what’s the use of doing such a thing? Marriage must make everyone happy. That’s the first sign. If a marriage doesn’t make everyone happy such a marriage is a curse and these marriages don’t stick also because you must have the support of the collective. You have the support of the collective and if it generates joy and happiness, children are better, society is better and the whole situation is so good; you enjoy such marriages. But when you find something goes wrong, you all become very serious, you don’t like it. As in, you know in England, you have problems with the royal family and all the rumour that princess Diana is going to divorce. And everyone was so unhappy about it. They used to think as if they were Romeo and Juliet and all these ideas were in their heads and suddenly you hear of such ugly stuff. And people were very nervous and then they became very unhappy about it. So the marriage is the best way to give happiness to others: by having sweet children, having good family, having a sensible life. This gives such a joy to all the collectivity. So that’s why it is important in Sahaja yoga, that you should have marriages which will be sensible, which will be balanced and you create beautiful children because I told you so many children are anxious to get born to Sahaja yogis because they are great souls and they want sensible parents so we must understand the essence of everything. Why in Sahaja yoga we prefer this? But of course there is no hard and fast rule if you want to experiment with something you can experiment but when you suffer, Sahaja yoga can’t help. So whatever is needed, whatever is good has to be toured and guided and we should live with that idea.

Now another thing that affects collectivity, I think, is the idea of having a separate house, it’s very common with Indians especially, so beware of them. Indians can find out ten excuses to have a house of their own. This is the worst part of Indians you see, they cannot have a collective life. Now we built a nice ashram for them in Delhi, spending so much money I tell you I also gave them a lot of money and there’s not even a rat in there. I said what is this? Nobody lives there. They said Mother you can live there, I said I am the only one who has to live in so many ashrams. What’s the use of wasting money on the ashrams then? What is this? There’s no need to build any ashrams if you are not going to live together. If you people cannot live together how can this world going to live? And only when you, all of you, are together my attention is there. Now we have some very good ashrams, very good ashrams and they have done wonders; where the leader is kind, compassionate, loving and also correcting. If you love somebody the person doesn’t mind being corrected. Now I also tell you many things you don’t mind because you know I love you very much. And this love is the thing that really is the collecting point. So if the leader is very affectionate, compassionate, then if he tells you that this is not good for you, this is not good for your benevolence nobody minds, because it’s good for you. It’s just for you, for something that will be good for you, for your society, for the country, for the whole world. And so we have to realise that we are here for a tremendous task. Such a work nobody has done so far. No saints have done so far. Poor things they were born one here, one there and one there; either they were killed, poisoned, thrown away or tortured so far. But you are not one. You are so many all over the world. You have friends everywhere and you have so many relations everywhere, such a sweet thing.

Then another thing these people come to Ganpatipule, many of you, then you should not form an Australian group. This was once we discovered that Australia is great, Australia is this thing and then it fell down.  God created one world really, but then human beings called them Australia, India, England like that, that’s their own brain. See it’s all their headache, not ours. We are all one. So when we come to Ganpatipule, we must know that we must mingle with other people. We should know them and we should write to them and we should have lot of fun and make fun of yourself and fun of them. It’s very enjoyable. Because after Sahaja yoga only you start seeing what’s wrong with Australia, what’s wrong with India, what’s wrong with England. Because you are so detached and you start seeing that this was the mistake and you really enjoy. I enjoy really when they pull each other’s legs nicely and enjoy each other’s company. And so sporty and so sweetly enjoying each other’s company. That’s the greatest enjoyment for me. And when I see people are in a very jovial mood, in a very understanding mood and they are together, of all the nations. Now they are 40 nations, can you believe? And if you just forget that we belong to any particular country, we belong to the country of God’s kingdom. Everything works out alright. And we have to be beautiful people otherwise the others see and say, oh! Such a man was there and such a person was there and he did that. I mean we have no business. You don’t need to be arrogant at all with anyone. There’s no need. We have to be extremely loving. Because love some people think is weakness, it is not; it’s the strongest thing. Now you can see from me, in a way I am foreigner in your country I came to you, know that and the love has worked. So love is the strongest thing and we have never used the power of love, which of course you know, how to give bandhans and things have to work it out your love.  So you have to have faith in yourself that you are loving, you are compassionate, that’s why you are dynamic cause love is dynamic. And all these things will help you. Now living together you can do something collectively also and bring in some ideas that you can work out this way and that way and so many things can be done and we can really establish a kind of a proper society of Sahaja yogis. As you know that Vishwa Nirmal Dharma has been accepted as a federal religion in America. So we have to establish here also. Now when you have entered into that then all these conditionings and all these egos just stop alright and you become pure and beautiful people, which you can I mean it’s your own property, it’s within you, so why not get to it? Why to ruin yourself for anything else but to ascend? And in ascending you never can be in trouble.

Now we have to help so many people. There are people suffering from alcoholism, suffering from drugs, suffering from other things, mental problems, physical problems, all kinds of things you can do a lot. One person can save so many people. So now all of you should decide also how many people you are going to meet and how many people you are going to give realisation to and how many people you are going to attend to. Now when these new people come in then also one has to be careful. Not to immediately say you are bhoot, you are this, you are that. They don’t understand your language. See you must know your language is different, of chakras. So the best thing is to talk to them softly, gradually tell them what is Sahaja yoga. Because it’s absolutely new science, they think it’s a new philosophy; it’s not. It’s an ancient one but they think like that. So the best thing is you take everything in such a manner that the another person understands that you are dealing them in a very subtle and beautiful way. You don’t just try to be aggressive. Aggressiveness is not a sign of saints. You have to be very kind, you have to be very gentle, you have to be very sweet and understanding and that they are not yet realised souls. They are just now come into Sahaja yoga, they are not established as saints. That’s the sign of a good Sahaja yogi. Anything else you want to ask me, you tell me and I will definitely try to see to that it works out.

Now this one thing I have seen how much depth should we have that works out? Sometimes it’s so remarkable. There was this one fellow called Alok who came to me in Madras about one and a half year back only and he just jumped into the ocean. He’s such a great Sahaja yogi and then he was in Bombay where he received news from his mother that she was very serious there. So he went down to Rohtak from Bombay. When he was in Rohtak, he found out that his mother was just about to die, the doctors said within three days she will be dead. So he just took my photograph and before my photograph he went, Mother please cure my mother, that’s all and can you imagine within three days she improved so much that he brought her all the way to Bombay. Then he took her, they said it’s a serious type of cancer and they took her to a very famous hospital in Bombay, Tata hospital for cancer and, you will be amazed, they said its negative, there’s no cancer at all. So it’s the depth within you, it’s not the blind faith but the depth, deeply how much you are in Sahaja yoga and he’s been there only one and a half year and then he said I want to give up my job , now what’s the use of doing job. I better do Sahaja yoga job. I said you are doing Sahaja yoga job alright don’t give up this job, there’s no need to give up anything. So you know like a tree is settled in the same place but grows, in the same way you have to grow and it works out very well.

Now another thing you asked me about a school to be started. It’s a good idea to start a school, that will be very good for little children and then when they grow up we will see (inaudible).it’s a very good idea. And in a place like that you can have a school, if you have a big placement, you can have a school, you can have a meditation centre there. Meditation should also be somewhere. Everybody should not be brought to the photographs which has got the crown and all that, they will be shocked. So just have ordinary photographs like this, for meditation room. But for meditation room you can have a photo that you like, but for a general centre you should not have all these things because they don’t like it to be (inaudible) and then for children also you can have there. You can also make it an exhibition room or something like that.

And another thing I find that Australia is a very expensive place. So I think when you all come to India you should get the list of things you want to collect over there and buy them. I just can’t imagine how expensive it is. So all those who are here also you can buy things for them and bring them. I think this is one of the most expensive places. I don’t know much, but Helsinki is another one; but in some things this is a very expensive place except for food, food is alright. And rest of it is very expensive. So when you come to India remember that you go out shopping nicely and get things for other Sahaja yogis also (inaudible). So next time I hope to see you all in Ganpatipule. I know that Ganpatipule is rather expensive but try to put it down a little bit. But as the time is passing you see every inflation going up, and even the food getting (inaudible) I don’t know how to bring it down, but we have kept to the same amount for last three years and this year maybe we might be getting it down more , a little bit, some sort of a compromise. But for one month in Australia we pay much more than in India. Only you travelling is the problem, which you should little bit sort out, but the more the merrier, as they say, you come along. But I would say still Australians shouldn’t stay together. You should meet with other people, make friendship, write letter. Because I am talking here about the collectivity of the whole world. And that’s what you belong to. Anywhere you go, any place, it’s so surprising sometimes how you meet a Sahaja yogi. Like we had one girl, she went down to Sicily, and another one went from, I think, Austria. And both were sitting in one restaurant. This one was sitting here and another one there and suddenly because of vibrations they were attracted to each other. In a while they were attracted so one went and talked with the other and said you come from where? And she said I am from Austria. And she just put her hands under the table and she said,” Are you a Sahaja yogini?” ” Yes, how do you know? Are you a Sahaja yogini?” “yes.” And the amount of love they felt between themselves and they described it so beautifully like a poetry, and I was so happy that in a farfetched place like Sicily, two girls from two countries meet there. So very happy just with vibrations. Same with the people when they come, you see, sometimes they are not wearing badges or anything, just with vibrations they know that these are Sahaja yogis. All over the world you have brothers and sisters and never get lost even if you want to. That’s how it is. You have anything, any problem you tell me.

Now about this one marriage you have said, I have no objection but responsibility is more there and that’s not mine so much. And second one is the problem of this lady having two children, she is a Sahaja yogini and (inaudible), somebody like that, we must have our self-respect. Unless and until you are married to someone, if you stay with someone it’s a stigma for you, as well as your children. So I don’t think I agree with that if you stay with someone without marriage. See you don’t know how he will treat you, how it will work out. And they have to be Sahaja yogis cause then we can see that they don’t misbehave. Of course I won’t say 100% we are successful at this, but 99% we are successful in our attempt to get very happy, prosperous, beautiful, married life. And without that what’s the use? All the time there’s struggle, fighting, what’s the use? So that could be a better idea is to have a sane thing which is marriage and which is very sensible thing and which will definitely help you all very much to settle down. Otherwise you will be all the time unhappy and insecure. Now those who cannot get married say, you cannot come to Ganpatipule can send their photographs and all those things we will decide there. I mean they can get engaged, they can get married not a problem. They can get married here also but they should send their photographs properly also and send their, just like in India and supposing, supposing we find somebody for you there very good, then we will send you a message and collectivity can pay for you. You come and you can stay with that person for a month, go around, see and if you like it you can marry. So there’s no compulsion for you to marry somebody I tell you. Or there’s no compulsion about that you have to get into that marriage, not at all, if you want to get married, you get into that list, you send it over then I sort it out more on vibrations and it works, on vibrations. Somebody could be this way or somebody could be that way, like very remarkable thing happened this time that we have a very very good Sahaja yogi called as Chris Marno in London, very good Sahaja yogi, and he told me that he wants to marry an Indian girl, but she should be very good in vibrations. And said any colour, any shape, anything, doesn’t matter, as long as she is a bundle of vibrations Mother. I don’t want anything else. I didn’t understand what he was saying. But for his age there was only one girl available and she was from south, very dark. Though I would say she was quite good looking in a sense to me with the norms over there, but very dark, and little on the plump side. He wanted a plump wife also that was one more point. He said I don’t want bones around my life (inaudible) that was alright. Still I would not quarrel anything (inaudible) or for a western mind she may be ugly you know. And I told him on this that see this is the photograph of this girl and this is this, and if you like her and really want to marry her, really want to marry her then you can marry her. So when he saw her he just jumped, he just jumped, he said ‘that’s the one, Mother!’ I was so surprised, I said why? He said tremendous vibrations from her eyes also, there are vibrations flowing from such innocent eyes, he just fell for her and he was so so happy I tell you. While you will find somebody because, somebody is a, I mean, I don’t know why, somebody will just say no for someone, because they have black hair, somebody has grey hair or I don’t like a blonde and I don’t like a black hair person, all these nonsensical ideas start, I mean they are so superficial, I mean hair you can always colour it, except for some people will say the nose is long, somebody will say. After all God has made everybody differently, they cannot be one, like they are not plastic things. So they have to be different and the faces have to be different and in Sahaja yoga they have that inner beauty shinning in their faces and that you can see it. If you understand this point then you won’t say no because this is this. But of course if there is any reason for saying no I will say alright, you never marry. But even after marriage I have seen people become so crazy and mad, I can’t understand what happens to them. Like we had one marriage to a boy who is very good Sahaja yogi in India, to a very good looking girl, very very good looking girl, I mean a good Sahaja yogini and then she went mad, I don’t know, she went amok. She took that boy to Kashmir for a honeymoon, we don’t have honeymoon, because we have honey and moon everything in Sahaja yoga. There’s no need to go for a honeymoon and all that. But she went for a honeymoon and spent 2 lakhs of rupees of that boy. And then she started asking him for this and that and she started giving all kinds of troubles to the mother-in-law, father-in-law staying in their house. “We must take another house, we must get out of it.” Within one month’s time everybody went crazy and she went into Poona street, you see, kissing him, hugging him, oh God! So embarrassing for other Sahaja yogis. They came,’ Mother, what is this girl is?’ and the boy also got frightened with her, he said, “Mother, please send her away, I just can’t bear it, it’s too much.” Now she’s gone, now she’s improved, she said I was possessed, it was a bhoot. When you blame a bhoot, you are a Sahaja yogini, how did you get into this kind of a madness? That because he was a rich boy, alright; so you shouldn’t get into such a mad idea, you should understand that he is a Sahaja yogi and you are a Sahaja yogini and the whole thing is so absurd now, that, this boy says, “no Mother! Not me, not with her.” He’s so frightened of her. Though she says I am alright, the bhoot has gone, this that. I didn’t marry her actually, that’s one of the point I must tell you, because there was some sort of remark about her from the leader. So I just had kept that waiting, I said let’s see, next year we will see about her. But she stayed back, she was anxious to get married and they stayed in the same house where these people were living. And she managed him I think and then all these things happened and such a problem. That boy is completely shattered, such a nice Sahaja yogi. So you also have news like that, sometimes without my knowledge things have happened, but you have to know that whatever you have to think, whatever you have to analyse, whatever you have to decide, should be done before marriage not after marriage. But before marriage they will never think, Mother has said it, alright, we like this. After marriage, oh! This is so, this is so, this is so. It’s a funny thing, it’s not a joke, it’s not a show, it’s not something as cheap as that. You are married somebody, you have no business to ruin somebody’s life like that. They start thinking after marriage is a wrong thing, before marriage you should decide, that is one of the curses of the western society which should not be brought to Sahaja yoga. We have no right to hurt anybody, no! You decide yourself beforehand, you tell me last minute if you tell me I don’t want to marry it’s perfectly alright. But after that when you have married somebody you have no business to hurt somebody, it’s sort of a very sinister thing. It might come up that you are trying to hurt someone, that’s not good. So before marriage you should decide and after marriage you should accept it and make it a beautiful marriage. You can show to people, there are people who we can say have been very happily married. And also a situation of the husband is dominating or the wife is dominating and that should not be such. As I have told that you are two wheels of one chariot but the left is on the left and the right is on the right. If you try to fix the left on the right it will be a mess or any one of the wheel is smaller than the other they are equal but not similar, then the chariot will be going round and round. So it is that you have to respect the equality of Sahaja yoga and Sahaja yoginis and Sahaja yogis. But also you must know that you are not similar, woman is a woman and a man is a man. And it’s nice to be a woman, I sometimes think, because poor men have to please so many people in this world and a woman has to just please the husband, finished, it’s a simpler job. But in any case, you should be proud of being a woman or a man, and this fighting with men for what? Fighting with men for job is not necessary. What is there to fight with men for jobs and for getting this thing better and that thing better, after all it’s so materialistic. You should really understand that we are the source of power, we are like this Mother Earth which gives everything and since she is so clear and that’s how we should have that idea that we have been doing everything.
