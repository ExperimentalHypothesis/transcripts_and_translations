Talk to yogis. Dr. Johnson's house, Birmingham (UK), 16 June 1979.

I am really sorry you [must be here to] achieve that but I am saying that to achieve [it has to be done] according to the timing of the Divine. You cannot plan out your own things. That's how sometimes one has to be [later] and sometimes one has to be earlier.


But one thing is definite the time has come for the final happening of your being. This being has been passing through various creases of life. You know that? You may be a small little amoeba and then a fish or a plant. And that's how they believe they went on till you are today here sitting as a human being. 


All this has happened to you without your knowledge, without your deliberations. And you have taken for granted that you are a human being and all the rights as a human being [as/on?] your own. In the same way you have a right to be something more than what you are, because even today you do not know what is your purpose, why all these effort was put in to create you, what is the meaning of this life. [Do we/To be?] conscious. Just you were created for nothing at all for thousands of years. In such a manner so many saints were discarded. So many seers were discarded. So many [Gods/forms?] were discarded. And then gradually one by one they started disappearing from this earth. Ultimately we find there are so many human beings now on this earth. But it is not easy to explain how in this short time you were created and so many were created.


Whether you believe it or not but there is a source, there is a controlling power, which starts acting. Human beings themselves have been talking about God,  have been writing about God, themselves. Of course they were guided by incarnations who let them do this kind of a [scripture/feature?], no doubt. But still animals do not think of God. They cannot think of anything abstract. So there is an awakening within every human being that we are not complete and there is something [exist?] after beyond. 


Now if I say that just now there is, we know about this universe through our senses. It is just a dream. It's a fact. It is just a dream. You are not going to believe it that this is all a dream when you can see very clearly. But those who see everything in the dream Ã¢Ë†' clearly in the dream Ã¢Ë†'  are we not related to all the thing that they [create] in the same manner as it exists today? So when I say that you have to be awakened out of this dream and jump into that awareness, which is complete awakening, you might say that this is going to be from one dream to another dream and from this dream to another dream. [How are] you going to prove that even that awakening [INAUDIBLE]?  You start feeling the vibrations as you have heard about it. Then how are you to believe that even those vibrations that you feel and the supreme power you feel, all-pervading collective consciousness you feel within yourself, it also another dream and you have to be awakened beyond that. 


I would like any one of the Sahaja Yogis to answer this question if possible. Can you tell Me that if you [INAUDIBLE] if you [INAUDIBLE]?  I would like to know if any Sahaja Yogis can say definitely that the dream that you have come out of it now  Ã¢Ë†' because you are feeling the vibration, you are feeling the collective conscious within you yourself Ã¢Ë†' is also not another dream. I want you to think about it. Can anyone give explanation? Can anyone think of an explanation that even that all-pervading power you are feeling is not a dream? 


Sahaja Yogi: Dream doesn't change.


Mother: Beg your pardon.


Sahaja Yogi: Dream doesn't change.


Mother: But how can you say that you are [still in a dream] and how will you say that it will change or not? How can you say definitely that it is not going to change? [If it is all right] [INAUDIBLE] .So I want to give a little [INAUDIBLE] supposing you see why should you believe Me also. 


Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]


Mother: [Why not /You should find out] well I am taking you from dreams to dream and again to another dream.


Sahaja Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]


Mother: Today only I told you that I will ask you a question. How do you say that these vibrations that are there, you are not dreaming about them?


Sahaja Yogi: If they are there how can we dream about them?

Mother: See, but may be that in this case they are there because you are in another dream state, the third one. 


Sahaja Yogi: This is my personal opinion that this dream for me. It is one that has come true. 


Shri Mataji: True, but what do you say that for the next dream, what about the next dream? May be something else would be there. 


Sahaja Yogi: We feel that by vibrations.


Shri Mataji: But even vibrations could be dream. You see, you just think about it, why am I saying that you don't just accept Me as I am saying it? You should keep your mind [in balance/on the alert?].


Sahaja Yogi: You don't just think.


Shri Mataji: You don't think about it. Why not? [You can also think about it] and this is the point. The point is not that you don't think about it. But, but in the dream whatever you have now you have come to this state of consciousness where you are just conscious. Then whatever you have in this conscious state cannot be used in your dream. You cannot use that in your dream. But when you get realized then you can use that finding [in Sanskrit called ............?] to solve the problems of this dream. You see, that is why that is not a dream.


Whatever creates the dream, the ignorance, you can face it by the findings of Sahaja Yoga. Every minute you can face it as you [INAUDIBLE].  So, it should not be a criteria that I do not take any money from you, so you just believe Me. No, you should not believe on this point. But the thing is, if your dream, that is today's conscious mind where we are in the center in the conscious mind, then this conscious mind receives super-consciousness. Then that consciousness can be used to solve the problems of this dream. And this is why we have to know that whatever you achieve through Sahaja Yoga breaks all the dreams. Later on you can even use it for the dream itself, because you entered absolute state and you have that absolute awareness which we call as Chaitanya Lahari. It is the vibration by which you can judge everything. The dream that was there you should clear [INAUDIBLE] and this conscious [mind/sign?] and also the future that is God and his ways. All these things can be felt through these vibrations.


The obstructions, which come in your way not to feel, we call them as baddha. Obstructions are called as baddha, means by which you cannot feel them fully. Maybe the instrument is not all right. Maybe there is something wrong. But the feelings that you get of these vibrations are not clear-cut in your mind and there is a Vikalpa. Vikalpa means doubt. The doubt is there because your feelings are not correct. There is a vicious circle on this point. Even when you do get your vibrations, then doubts are there because your feelings are not yet all right. 


So when you feel the vibrations perfectly well you can be doubtless. It is a vicious circle. Because of the doubts you do not feel the vibrations. And because there are no vibrations you are in doubts. This is the point. Even after realization one has to know beforehand because we have had experiences, because people came to My program, got realization and they never come back. The reason for that is, this time is very important and that is the time when your Kusaal,  your capacity, achievement, is tested. 


Realization people get. Vibrations they do get. But your capacity to be steady into that state is only possible if you yourself, you are determined to do it. Otherwise you are again thrown into the same [plain/place?]. Like if you are getting drowned and somebody tries to save you, brings you on the boat, but still you are not sure whether you are in the boat or sinking deep and slip down back again. Again, we push you back. Again, you slip down. This thing goes on.


But if you could stick on to the boat with determination it helps much more. Because that is how you are going to know your meaning of life. Because of this little problem I have seen in Sahaja Yoga we get people who are excellent. This is not the work of ordinary people, of the mediocres. There is a saying in Marathi language [saying in Marathi goes here?]  It's not for the lousy to come into it. So this is the point where you have to achieve that, and that point is very important. Why I have today started with it, because I have seen many a times all the effort sometimes are lost just like that.


Now here placed within you, all the chakra that are shown here. I would like to tell you the names of these chakras here. Now this chakra is the first chakra of the center within us, which is in a subtle form we do not know about, but we know about it in the gross form, again in the dreamland, you can say. The gross form is called as the pelvic plexus. But it is manifested by this subtle chakra known as Mooladhara. 


This is a very, very important chakra within us, because that is how we started having life, because this carbon was introduced in life. Now without carbon you cannot form life, and so this is the chakra where this is the state where we really became living being. The life pulsates within us and that's how it is demarcated. It also represents all the matter that we have used. So carbon stand in the center of the periodic table, as you understand, and that is the highest evolved element, because when carbon was introduced then only we started pulsating as living being. But it has nothing to do with Kundalini. So all the living beings are at this level now. But while you have a higher position, all these built in you, then they also have the capacity to have all these. So the human history starts straight from here. It is the base. That's why it is called as Mooladhara charka, base of creativity, the base of [INAUDIBLE]. Now which is the root Ã¢Ë†' is this one.


This one is the germinating force within you by which you evolve to a higher state, and this is placed within your triangular bone which you can see with your naked eye. Believe it or not, it's there. It exists. But if you tell a doctor he won't believe you. I was Myself a student of medicine and I would think now, "How to talk to these people? So better to learn their language so that you can talk to them." It exists there and many of the people who are here have seen this pulsating in them, this one. And this Kundalini is the force, which is kept there, residual force, which is kept there for your rebirth, as they call it.


The Brahmin is called as a dwijaha means the one who is born again, reborn. As Christ himself has said, that you have to be twice born. Like an egg of a hen, you are born living into this dream and in this cocoon of your own being. When you are ready, your Mother can pierce on the head of the cocoon and can bring you out, though the transformation has been done by you, within yourself, without feeling it through the divine force, and I have seen today is the time you are just right for hatching of the egg.  


The blossom time has come. The time of transformation has come. And thousands have to be transformed. You have to know the meaning of your life. Because you are created for a purpose from amoeba to this stage, you have grown, and now the one who has created you, the one who has given you all the beauties and bounties of this universe, wants you to know Him and enjoy all the bounties.


Like the Father bestows you all the properties, all these enjoyment [on earth?] out of His love. It is a manifestation of His love that has brought us to this stage. And His love only is going to give you that status by which you are going to be enrolled into the Kingdom of God. Instead, I know people have been harmed much more. It is very, very simple proposition, which is difficult for human beings to understand, that this was desired as a father desires for his son, even when he is not his [INAUDIBLE], how he is going to bring him up and how he is going to bestow all his love and all his earnings on that child. 


In the same manner, the Great Father has planned the whole thing in such a beautiful manner and He is going to look after His own creation. No one can destroy it. He is Almighty. Only thing is that you may destroy yourself, because He has made you free. He has given you freedom. He has treated you as a friend. Because if you have to be enrolled you have to be a free person and you must know how to enjoy the glory of freedom.


In that freedom if you have chosen something wrong then you cannot blame God [for it?]. But even if it is just a mistake then He will work it out with thousandfold of His glories and mercies to see that you are safe. He is going to use all His powers to see that you receive, that you get what is promised. That is what Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja means spontaneous. Perhaps we do not understand the full meaning of spontaneous, because spontaneous itself is an abstract word [to be] precise. It is just His spontaneous power that works it out. He is spontaneity Himself. And His powers are spontaneous. His plans are spontaneous. You can see everywhere how nature spontaneously bring thousands of things which we cannot answer, neither can we understand it, nor can we appreciate it. Like a little flower becoming a fruit Ã¢Ë†' we take it for granted. If there are flowers, all right, take it. They are there. If they are fruits, we eat them. In the same way we have taken for granted everything and we have taken for granted Sahaja Yoga also. It's going to work out, going to be within you, and all of you are going to get it.


In this center, the second center which [INAUDIBLE] because this is the center, which is called as a Manipur center, which controls our navel organs or, as we can call them, as the solar plexus. There is a solar plexus which controls all the organs in the stomach, all the viscera, and this center actually comes out of this center. It is an additional center of this, which revolves around this area and looks after organs that are inside the stomach.


And God has made you in His own image. You can see that, that this is the place where God has created this universe. Then the stars and all the galaxies are created. And then the earth is created down here. And we have a sun and a moon, but in our being itself also we have got all these centers placed within us. This is the star of Jupiter, you can say. All of them have also stars which are like all these big stars, are push buttons in the, in the viscera or in the stomach abdomen or [God Almighty?].


In the same way, we too have got this center. Is very important. If you can see here that it is surrounded by this water element, and this center is meant for your freedom. So, first the life started existing in this water and then seeking started. The seeking started because we have in-born built-in sense of seeking. Amoeba seeks the food. Animals seek also food and also other things like protection. It learns how to protect itself. But the human beings seek the meaning of his being. This seeking here is our [sub-conscious?]. This side is the blue line that is showed within you, is the line of your existence which manifests your left side sympathetic nervous system. And the line, other line that is shown here is the line of your creativity, of your physical being which is represented by or manifested by your right side sympathetic nervous system. 


In the center is the seeking. And you see that there is a void. There is a void in between. You do not know how to approach from there. Human being have this center as critical point because after the point of protection, animals [learn/die?]  They learn methods how to protect themselves. But this is a point, which is very important, where human beings have raised their head up. This center is a very, very vital center because that is the point where human beings have accepted their responsibility. They've accepted the [petty notion?] that they are [the I-ness?] started with this center.  Because at this center as it is shown in the figure is slightly wrong. You can say that is connected on both the sides.


At this center, when the human beings start using these two powers within them, of one of existence and another of creativity or we can say emotional, [mental], physical power, they reduce from their being fumes of tensions. And these two fumes as they are showed there, go into the brain and form on this side the super-ego and that side as ego. Now how super ego is formed and how ego is formed and what it is, I will tell you in short. As in a factory, when there is activity, you see the fumes coming out. In the same way, when we have our emotional activity, all our physical mental activity, the fumes, which represents all the activities of  [backstabbing/back sharing?], are accumulated in these balloon-like structure. These two balloon-like structures when they meet [INAUDIBLE], then a human being [INAUDIBLE] separated from the mains.


Animals are not separated. Only human beings are separated. They have been given a freedom. They are born with a fontanelle area as you can see in childhood is very, very soft. And you can see the pulsation through which the power flows into the limbic area. But when a child grows and his [true/does?] activities [INAUDIBLE] just like that, there's calcification of that bone and you find that the head here becomes hard. That's why sometimes people say "hard nut". This hard nut is the place where this Kundalini has to pierce. She has to rise from her seat, go upward and pierce that fontanelle area. Which means, although it's called as baptism. This was the baptism that John the Baptist said. Not that you get baptized from some theological college or from some [INAUDIBLE] or some sort of a clownish looking people. They cannot do it. They may present like clowns, then say, "All right [all right, you are] baptized." It's absurd. What is their authority to do such things? And that's how when in the modern times you feel, if you ask people, "Do you believe in God?" "No." "Why?"  "Because our clergyman is like that." But the church should not assume that they are representing God.


In the same manner, in every religion, this so-called Hinduism, which you think is something very great, and people have exploited you is even [sincere] and much worse than Christianity could be any time. This sort of exploitation is one of the greatest hurdles in your getting the realization. One time the seekers, the innocent seekers were seeking. They don't find in church, so they go to an Indian [church/temple?] and where they may purchase some ganja and end up in some [INAUDIBLE] or something like that. That is one of the greatest hurdle, I would say today, that the way the innocence of the people is being exploited by people who think that they can sort of make money. They are not worried about their own seeking. How can they [INAUDIBLE] or some sort of a flagrant or you can say sadistic happiness out of it?


This center, the whole of this center, which is supported by your sustenance, is disturbed. Here the human sustenance is retained and created and looked after. And there are great incarnations who come on earth to teach that this is the sustenance you should adhere to. But there are also horrible, wicked, evil geniuses who come on this earth. They come in this area and they disturb your sustenance. That is the, as I said, the greatest problem that is facing humans. Actually, it will be something like a beautiful garden I come to and I find beautiful flowers around and [I just find/ I am just fine?].  And here I find the flowers mutilated for the selfish end of the absolutely depraved and low type of human beings, they should have honed actually and [killed]. That is how depraved they are. Even animals with horns are thousand times better. They want to retard your progress and that is how we find today the situation is at the blossom time. That all the flowers have [dried?]. Otherwise they were to be fruits, very beautiful. It was to happen with all of them with great care and concern from that [INAUDIBLE]. Now they have come up with [INAUDIBLE] and here we find that [suddenly] destroyed by the nonsensical horrible [creatures/people?]. Actually, I have no words to describe. You cannot understand this anguish. Now it is for the flowers to understand this. I was happy to learn that people have started calling themselves flower people. It was a good idea.


But they started another style of self-destruction out of suspicion. Others are destroyed as well, as you are also destroying [yourself]. The other side of it is also very, very tragic. I met the one of the Sahaja yogis here who has broken his back because he was parachuting. So I said, "Why did you do this?" [So I said, "Why should you do parachuting of all the things?"] because I know his value, I know he is comfortable. I know this he is a genius. I said, "You should not have gone for parachuting. You are not the child, for playing." This is [sheer/sure?] out of frustration. I said, "Better get [INAUDIBLE]"  till I go out of it [INAUDIBLE] something more the way I did it. I did it very well. But still it is there. There must be more there. But some of you have [INAUDIBLE]. Why? Because you have not been able to evaluate to find out the problem to know about yourself, what is serious you are. You are the core of the whole creation. How is it that you did not seek your own being? And this is the second hurdle that I have to face, you have to face, all those who believe that they should get realization have to face. This is how I am describing the void here. Because I have to do in a very short time and you know that subject matter is very clear.


I would suggest that let us have the light first. Let us get the realization. Then it would be easier to talk about it. Without light, what am I going to describe? And why should you believe? So better have your light. Better feel it, maneuver it, understand it and then use it. First time when this Kundalini touches your Brahmarandhra and when it opens out at this point, then you start feeling the cool vibration. So actually, that has happened. Let us see, in medical terminology the central path, which is the Sushumna, represents the parasympathetic nervous system. I do not want to bore you with the medical terms because I have been bored myself once upon a time. The central path of this Sushumna is manifesting the parasympathetic and if you go and ask the Doctors, they'll say, "Oh, no. We don't know much about it." Don't talk. 
This is the point; this is the line by which we manifest our present. Now today, just now today [INAUDIBLE] we cannot stay on this moment. Either we go to the past or in the future but we cannot stay here. If you could stay here then we could see these two things clearly. But we are all the time jumping and we cannot see because the past is finished and the future doesn't exist. So we don't see anything. Some [INAUDIBLE] that we don't see anything. We can only see something or feel something if you could steady ourself on this parasympathetic which we cannot. Medically, they say that we cannot tamper this energy of parasympathetic. Now this is what we have achieved up to this point as human being. 


This is our achievement, which is felt in our physical being, in our emotional being and in our mental being. But also, there is another being which is our spiritual being which we can aspire but we cannot feel it and that spiritual being resides in the heart as Sprit. That Spirit sees. It knows everything about which you cannot get to it. Your own attention does not reach that. That's why you cannot feel it. For example, you see this pillar; so the pillar is not you. You see these flowers. Flowers are not you. You see this hand, and this hand is not you because you see it. So there are two things going on all the time. Then, you see, you have a brain. That means you are not your brain. Then you see that you think, that you are not your thoughts. Then the one that sees everything is the One who resides in the heart. This is the reflection of God Almighty who resides on your head, on your heart. Now immediately, if you start jumping like a jumping jack, that how we talk of God. I am just talking of it. I am not saying that here is the key. Later on we'll find out really all what I talk is true or not. Because for the time being it's just a hypothesis. We'll just take it as a hypothesis. 


So the reflection of God within us is the Spirit. And when the Kundalini rises, she touches the feet of God Almighty. This is symbolically I am saying. Immediately, you become enlightened by the Spirit in the heart. And it starts pulsating you. In your heart there is pulsation but you cannot feel that pulsation in your body forcefully. When that happens you start feeling that pulsation when the Spirit pulsates. And when she is the one who is part and parcel of the whole, you get connected to the whole. You start feeling the whole, and that's how you actualize. You actually get it within yourself, the manifestation of collective consciousness. It's very much higher than that of animal consciousness. You are very [wholly compared] to the animal. It [INAUDIBLE] like the animal has to pass through [INAUDIBLE], but human beings can. They do not feel the color. They do not enjoy the color. They cannot enjoy the [INAUDIBLE]. For an animal, if you show him a [INAUDIBLE] he'll not understand [INAUDIBLE].  He doesn't know what is the beauty.


So, in the same way when you become your being, your consciousness become collectively manifesting. That means you become one with the whole. Say you are Self somewhere here in the image of God, then this self become connected with the whole. You can feel the connection. That's how whole oneness is established within you. How it's happening is that you start feeling the vibrations flowing from your [heart/hand]. And all these chakras, which are enlightened, get enlightened here and activated. All these colors will tell you which chakra are related to which finger here. If you see here, you can make out all of them. Now when these are activated, you start feeling others on your activated hands. You can start feeling their centers. You can start feeling your own centers. This is what is self-realization, that you can feel your own centers.


All other nonsense has no meaning. People talk of self-realization and end up by going to some sort of a cemetery. They try to show that from the dead they are going to get you something that is [above limit]. This is the only way that you get your realization. If you say a seed sprouts through its primule, that's a fact. But if somebody says that you can sprout a seed through, say, the trunk, very good. [INAUDIBLE] It's all properly made and built-in within us. And this is the instrument, which is there within us, and only through this instrument you are going to get your realization. There is no other way out. And this one is such a beautiful one because here is your Mother, is your individual Mother waiting for this [thing?]. She is the one who finds you. She is the one who took you to spirituality. She is the one. She told that there is something above, and she is just waiting for a chance to rise and give you back your realization.
