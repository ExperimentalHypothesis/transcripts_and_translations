1983-02-10, Questions and Answers About America

Shri Mataji- did you hear me, nothing to learn from the Indians on the gross, and nothing to learn from the west, both are in the same melting pot. One is developed and one is developing

Yogi- on the spiritual level??

Shri Mataji- what do you think about Indians spiritual level is zero

Yogi-well the aspirations, what is still preserved in this country

Shri Mataji- you see if I have to talk to Americans, you know they’re ego oriented they’ll feel hurt, better not say India is anything greater than they have

Yogi- you’re being the diplomat of the diplomats

Shri Mataji- you see our main object is to get them into Sahaja Yoga, isn’t it? Not to blast them, so let us avoid subjects which will challenge their ego. Why to challenge their ego so they just get out of

Yogi-what we are trying to answer mother is the question of why do say 130 westerners come to India and undergo the sort of, the discomforts of India, what is it that they are looking for that they feel they can find here, from that point of view

Shri Mataji- then don’t put _______ you can put that, what is difference between Indian seeker and western seeker. That’s a better one, it doesn’t give them a seeking at a gross level because as long as they are seeking they are at a grosser level we can compare. What is difference between the two. But if you come to the subtler things then there is no difference.

Yogi-last one- what we thought was the suggestion you made to us that you also talk a bit about the guru. So what we are going to ask is that there are so many paths. Why does only sahaja got a God and what is the aim of the other gurus? It’s also controversial

Shri Mataji- (general chit chat)

Shri Mataji- Alright ask, better remove Ganesha otherwise they may question this

Yogi- what is importance of receiving self realization?

Shri Mataji- in the evolutionary process, as human being, has come out of a small little unicellular animal called amoeba as they say, the size, what is the purpose of becoming a human being. The purpose of his becoming a human being is that he has to become the spirit. This vehicle of a human body is to express the spirit within. Self realization is the epitome of our evolution so we all have to become self realized. Without self, we are in darkness, we are not aware of the all pervading power which is doing all the living works, all kinds of living works which we cannot do, what we do is the dead work or the mental projections which recoils back upon ourselves and ____________we must get to self realization, that’s the goal of human ascent from amoeba to this stage.

Yogi- what are vibrations?

Shri Mataji- vibrations are the feeling of the all pervading divine power within yourself on your central nervous system. You can feel the divine power for the first time after self realization on your central nervous system ending up into your finger tips where the sympathetic centres are located. So you start feeling on your hand the universal language which is spoken by the hand, the different centres and thus you know a rapport is established between the spirit and yourself because when you ask a question about any fundamental problem, you either get a cool breeze blowing into your hands or you just stop it sometimes you might get some blisters, also if the person is suffering from some sort of very great maladjust? You might get numbness if the person is on his way to death or could be very freezingly cold, so the hands start speaking as said by Mohammad Sahib that your hands will speak. When the time of resurrection will come, this is the time of resurrection because kundalini resides in the sacrum which is the Aquarius, this is the age of the Aquarius, this is the age of the kundalini.

Yogi- so this is the double question. The west has received from India a lot of gurus and each with seemingly a different path and its believed in the west that all the paths lead to God, many many people believe that it doesn’t matter how you go but you are going to get there. Is that what India has to contribute to the west, to the seekers of America?

Shri Mataji- India has to give the knowledge of the roots, while the west has the knowledge of the tree. But those who are exported from here I wonder how many of them are really genuine or they know anything about the roots. So I just can’t say that those that are going there are the people who can deliver the knowledge which is not yet known to the west. Whatever is unknown is not divine. To understand logically the difference between India and the west is this that India has still retained the fundamentals as the goal of life and the fundamental is that one should get self realization, that one should try to lead a life of balance of dharma because there is so much of knowledge of the roots in this country, people can become very hypocritical, they can be very dishonest and can misuse that knowledge to exploit the western people who are naïve about this knowledge. My idea of bringing some of the sahaja yogi’s from the west to India in the villages of India was to make them understand that comfort is not the goal of life because we have villagers who are realized souls who do not have any comforts which are so important to the western people but are very happy, satisfied and peaceful people and are extremely good yogi’s but that does not mean that you give up your comforts and you become godly, it’s all a mental behaviour if you think that be negation you can become godly is not the way but when you come to India you understand that this habit of seeking comfort must be given up, if you have any it’s alright but let not the comfort sit on your head. Let your spirit rule and not the idea that you should be comfortable or affluent that idea should not rule you.

Yogi- the other thing is we can ask you 1 or 2 of the questions for the American Press, the shorter American press

Shri Mataji- but I haven’t said anything about the guru ____. As I have said it that many fake people have gone to America because they know you are all naïve and anything bombastic will impress you very much, because American life is now become very money oriented and ego oriented so they have developed all the methods of pampering your ego and getting money out of you so that you feel that you can purchase the world. I was the first to go to America and then all of them followed and so many Americans suggested to me that mother why do you not get some money for yourself, and also ask for money for what you’re doing for these people because you are doing the real thing. Because Americans will not understand anything that is free and is precious but I said that money can only buy what is lower than you, it cannot buy something that is higher than you. But they said you will not be successful in America, you have to fix some money, I said I don’t want this success, I want Sahaja yogis, I want yoga to work. One day will come they will realize that those gurus whom they have purchased have exploited them, have exploited completely and have used them for their own purpose and have run away. Let them realize because if I tell them they are not going to realize it. One must know whatever is vital for life you cannot purchase. In all humility human beings also must realize that you have done nothing to become human beings. God has done everything. How much have you paid to him? But still they have to learn the lesson and once you get into the clutches of these gurus it is very difficult to get out till you get into big problems like heart attacks or lunacy, epilepsy, all these things but even if you get it you cannot connect that with this. You must understand that if you have a real guru as your master then at least your health should be alright, your wealth should be intact while they are only interested in the purse. Americans have lots of money and I think they are more interested in Americans than Indians because Indians don’t have any money. It is as simple as that.

Yogi- can anybody gain their realization?

Shri Mataji- yes most of you can, I mean, I would not say I can give realization to Hitler that anybody means even Hitler will stand before me and say that I will shave my moustache now give me. That’s too much for me. You must see truthfully, honestly if your own preconceived ideas about yourself then God says alright go ahead, try your luck, but if you think that you haven’t yet found out and that you have to see then if you’re humble about it it works out, it does, I think in the west all those that came to me got realization except for one who is not married, doesn’t believe in marriage, who doesn’t think that women are anyway good or something like that but he will also get married and get his realization

Yogi- why is too dangerous mother to experiment in the occult? Aren’t we learning something when we do those experiments?

Shri Mataji- because it is unknown to you, you don’t know what you are up to. Now we can divide this occult business into 2 sides, one is right and one is the left side. The movement of your attention to the right or to the left and is achieved by many blockades put into the chakras because if there is a blockade then the attention cannot move upward it starts moving sideways and they can block your Nabhi chakra or agnya chakra, any one of them and can take advantage of your position when your are not in the centre but either on the right or the left. If you go to the left then you run into the area called subconscious and then into collective subconscious where all that is dead from the creation is there. Now it is said that cancer is caused or triggered by proteins, just call it protees they don’t say dead souls as we say, 58 & 52 would trigger cancer, and these come from that area which is built within us since our creations means collective subconscious. All kinds of these diseases, myelitis, leukemia, all this comes from the left side. Now the right side movement only physical problems. Right side if you move, then you get very ego oriented and you meet people who are in the supraconscious and then into the collective supraconscious where all the ambitious people are dead and still hovering around. Doctors do not know about them much, but these people can work out these spiritual centres and where they can cure people and do operations and all sorts of things through these dead spirits and they can also work out things like Hitler did because Hitler used supraconscious forces from the lamas he learnt all this from the Tibetan Lamas, they used them and he enticed people with this idea of a superior race and he killed so many Jews, so the supraconscious or the collective supraconscious has a forces which are extremely dominating and they take you away from your heart and give you a very bloated idea about yourself and could be very violent and injurious to the whole society such a movement such people suffer from heart attacks from the over activity, then they can suffer also from diseases like diabetes, liver, all those diseases which look very simple like siroccos of liver, but the worst is that they are extremely harmful, they become very powerful, ahh gathering such ego oriented people and try to put very aggressive ideologies. They are mostly heading, they are at the helm of affairs mostly, they manage to reach there, their only ambition is to be at the heads and when such heads are there they can take countries into disasters, so anything is possible if they are into collective supra conscious state where these other forces act on them, these dead souls act on them and give them sinister idea and all kinds of dirty politics can come out of it or political problems may come out of it, which has no control over themselves and they get lost into that and people are harmed who cannot control it, ahh that force acting on them as what has happened in Germany so is a very good example. Then fanaticism also could be leading you to the same area, so its not only the occult that takes you to supraconscious area but fanaticism or any some sort of over martyrdom idea of nation is mine and I can dominate anyone as Americans definitely believe in freedom, they must know that they are rendered absolutely slaves by these souls which attack them either from the left or to the right. I must give you an incident to explain this. Some people came from America to see me, three of them, they told me they were scientists I don’t know their names, don’t remember long time back, about 10 years back, and they asked me that they have come to me to learn how to fly in the air, I said who sent you here of all the places, they said you please tell how to fly in the air, I said I don’t want to tell you that, its not proper because this is only done through souls which are dead, ambitious who try to give you a feeling that they are taking out your souls and is a very dangerous thing, tomorrow they will take out some childs soul away talk to the child and he will feel what a communication we had with the child and next day the parents will find the child is dead because ____?____ It’s a very common phenomenon these days people find suddenly the child is dead while asleep, it is because of these tricks people are trying on so many souls that they try to take out the souls and use them and then the souls cannot return back, so the child is dead. But they would not be convinced when I told them they would be enslaved by this because they said Russia is doing the same. I said if Russia is doing something wrong why do you want to do it, you will be enslaved, you believe in freedom so why do you want to do it? they said no because Russians are doing, we must out beat them and all, I said this is a very short term policy, very short sighted, you must not think on those terms because it is very dangerous, is dangerous for them, they will get possessed, you will get possessed, we’ll have set of 2 nations possessed what is going to happen to this world, so why do you want to do it, but then I asked them you have to tell me who sent you here, they told me the name of one Patanjali, he is a journalist in Bombay who came to see me because he was suffering from a disease like this, his body use to go out and soul use to fly out and his wife was so much worried and she gave me lots of proofs of what he was talking was true, then I had to treat him for a month regularly everyday to get rid of that problem, I said he could not have told you to come here but if he has I don’t understand, if I can remove the disease can I put back the disease into you. But they would not be happy with me because if I told them that I can teach you flying I am sure they would have been very happy, but it is rather difficult for me to tell lies, even if I want to please you. I don’t want to tell you lies because ultimately it turns out to be a horrible thing. Now the worst thing that can happen to human beings who get into occults is they get epilepsies. All mental diseases are from occult from occult practices, people can commit suicide people can become violent, you can make the complete mob a very violent mob, like you know an organization call anandinake tried to kill people, now we have many disciples from anandinake who are coming to us and what you find even then they built in a kind of a system within themselves that violence is the way you worship God. In occult you can take people to such wretched state that you can teach the people that sex can take you to God, I mean imagine Christ who said thou shalt not have adulterous eyes, they people who start teaching you that sex will take to God you have to accept against Christ, which is ant Christ which is anti God. How can people accept such a nonsensical thing, see which is not religion, if they read any book any traditional book about God they will know this is not religion so occult can take you to these things, but the worst is that it dangerous for people in America is that they believe that we should get traditions and if they do not see to the subtler side of the tradition they may fall a very great chances that they may fall prey to occult because apparently occult seems to be the tradition to them or sometimes it depends on certain gurus who were here about 50 years back or so who talked about Upanishads, about Gita, this, that, they talked but were not realized souls and they established themselves, even they went to America some of them and talked about these big big things with big big mouths and people believe that they are traditional is not true, tradition of Indian life has been as I told you is to get self realization, is kundalini awakening, that’s what Adi Shankaracharaya has repeated in the 6th century and I am repeating it again, so the tradition of this country has been throughout that a person must get his second birth which is tradition of Christian religion, tradition of Islam, and tradition of Bhudhism, tradition of Jainism, of Tao, of Zen, I can’t think of any traditional real religion who has not talked of self realization and even when they talk of kundalini they such horrible things about kundalini that one can’t believe it has anything to do with divine things, if it is the kundalini which gives you self realization, how can Christ talk about a kundalini which was harmful, which was troublesome because these people don’t know the way or method and they have no right to the kundalini they are doing something else which is occult. Occult is the most dangerous thing because it is coming from the satanic forces. When a person dies if he is a normal person he just dies and lives in the other world till he has to take another birth but if a person dies and if he has satanic forces within him one of the sadism, he takes back at the supraconscious area and who is a machoist stays in the collective subconscious area, so there is satanic forces, so going to a cult is just enslaving yourself to satanic forces. There was a guru who went to America, died there, and was very much influential with parapsychology and all that, now if I tell parapsychology the satanic they are not going to believe, dealing with spirits is not allowed in Christianity at all. I mean that is correct, not only in Christianity but in any religion it is not allowed. If you read kavitas has written pages and pages, but this guru has collected, 6 chrores worth of diamonds and the 2 disciples are fighting for that, another guru has collected 6 thousand chrores by telling you that he will make you fly, I mean you must use your brains, Americans are supposed to have brains but I don’t know what happens when it comes to human machinery, they don’t understand. And this is what it is, that if you want to ruin yourself you take talk Its sound fantastic to begin with, its sounds very well to go there, but its all advertising department of the hell.

Yogi- will be asking them to go on Australian tour, so have them in different settings, the questioner won’t be on the film, just your answers

Shri Mataji- as a mother I see that people are drowning themselves into trouble, all your problems of vandalism, huliganism, of dopes and things that you take, of violence, of bad marriages, all your social problems come because you have allowed the occult to grow there, and ultimately it comes to power, so be careful

Yogi- what is right way to have devotion and using our vishuddhi, so its related to America

Shri Mataji- you must know that it is the virata, so once you become one with the virat, then if you sing any praise to him it goes to him directly, any praise is sufficient, but you should not be one sided, all the time singing praises also one gets tired. So what you have to do is to also go meditate and sometimes when the heart is full you must sing. But specialization is not the way we have in Sahaja Yoga, I would suggest that some people really sing horridly, so they should not sing. They must try to___?___ their vishuddhi try to have a better voice. I’ll tell you Christine she had a very bad voice, after realization her voice became very sweet, so please try to improve your vishuddis so that whatever you sing is melodious at least to the ear. That’s the best way, but you are alright, you are melodious, but it should not be sound with aggressiveness to God but with surrender. You see sometimes this music is sung in such a way that you are just drowned inside and you don’t know how many are on top of you, it should be sung in such a way that there is no aggression of the music but a kind of a soothing effect, for everyone, and every style should be sung, every style is good, and try to find out better styles if possible. It should not be pleasing to you but pleasing to Gods. And the best judgement comes through vibrations. Now we have one American lady with us, I would like you to give her realization. Is she there?

Yogi- she’s gone, she had to go at 12

Shri Mataji- so she’s gone away, alright, she’ll come back, she’s worried about the women of India

Yogi- the Michelangelo statue in Rome of Moses, thats that adi-guru

Shri Mataji- you see __________ that the open sahasrara and that a guru always uses these horns to hit disciples to clear out the left and right, that’s why a mother guru in a simple thing, cannot get angry more than 10 minutes. They have 2 horns and they go on pushing into your and should not pay so much attention to these things. Everything will work out, you have to depend on your mother. Now those who are going to England, who are they? You have to take one ___man?___, one suitcase and one very light painting. Will you do it or will it be too much?

Yogi- each?

Shri Mataji- not much heavy and Linda will take the carpets for me, you’ll take the carpets for me. But if you can’t take it, or have objection, leave it, I’ll take it. You’ll want to want it, is to put my photograph on top of your luggage, that all, alright, the big ones, borrow them from Australia. In any case we are not smuggling anything. You might think it so simple like I have got things bought out of my own money, everything is there, but they said I cannot send it with Linda. You see India has so many qualities, one of them is tremendous intelligence and we have pick pockets you see. In India everything has an institution so pick pockets institution, and they have some very good ones in Lucknow, who boast of their pick pocketing, and some in Bombay who say they are the best pick pockets. So one fellow came from Lucknow, boasting that I am the greatest pick pocket and no-body can pick pocket. So he came to Bombay and he was wearing a ordinary what you call kurta with a coin he put it in it kurta pocket, which you can see very clearly gold coin. So he went round and round and around nobody pick pocketed, so he went near the one near the paan shop where this gossip is there, he said, see these people in Bombay, they could not pick pocket my coin, it is openly left there, they could not pick pocket, so the paan wala told him that please, see that coin of yours, it has been pocketed 32 times and everytime there is a new mark because it’s a coin which is not real coin so they have returned it back. So he felt very hurt, so he said alright, now I will out- do these Bombay wala, he said let some Bombay wala come with me and I will take him to Lucknow and see if he can pick pocket something. I’ll try to pick pocket something and I will see, the other way around, let him carry something with him and I will pick pocket him and lets see if he can find out, so they said alright (recording ended)
