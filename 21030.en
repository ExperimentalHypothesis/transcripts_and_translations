I bow to all the seekers of truth.

As you know very well, that all the religions have talked of one thing that is, we should seek the truth and that we have to be born again. But it is not just a certificate or a kind of a group we form, say that we are born again. But it is the actualization to believe that we have found the truth, that by reading a particular scripture, we are the people who are following the truth is just taking us to the darkness of fundamentalism. And that's why when people tell me that they are following the religion very strictly why is it physically, mentally, emotionally, they are so sick? But actually, they are not following reality. They have not tried to find out the reality. Thousands of years, our forefathers have been doing the same thing. There is no religion which has said that (inaudible) but this falsehood has  lead us into a very big mess that we have started hating each other in the name of religion and they have become now, all religions, very money-oriented. Either they go to the right side as told to you or go to the left side and become possessed. The ones who follow any religion whether it is Christian, Hindu, Muslim, any religion, is capable of doing any sin. There is no difference between any human being as such. They have to be truth-oriented and there is only one truth one must know that we are the Spirit. And that there is an all-pervading power, the Devine power, which does all the works, all organisation of all living things. As long as you have not felt that Devine power, you have not reached the reality. And unless and until that happens, how can we claim that we belong to this religion or that religion? So this blindness has led people to fundamentalism and I think this is the biggest problem of the World today.In Sahaja yoga, people get cured, no doubt, because of the internal system working it out, because it is the bi-product of your Self-realisation. And once you are established as a self-realised soul then it's very seldom you get sick. Physically you improve. No doubt. Also, you become a very relaxed personality, as if you are away from the waves of turmoil in a boat ( inaudible....)Of course, the doctors should not have any worry that Sahaja yoga will displace them. There are very few people who are really wise, so far I have seen, who come to Sahaja yoga, especially the very rich always go to the doctors to the specialist.So what we are trying to tell you is that this system helps the people who cannot afford to go to the doctor. Diagnosis is very easy because you can feel on the fingertips what the problem is on the chakras. When you want to treat a tree if you treat the leaves it can not be cured but if you really can go into the roots, reach the roots, it's very easy to cure that tree. So the knowledge of Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of the roots. Roots of human civilization. Another problem we have is of  ecological problem which we have created ourselves. Machinery are for us and we are not for machinery. But the way we have become so materialistic that we have to have  machines to produce many things for us, and all useless things like plastics and nylons. When a person gets his Self-realisation he also becomes very sensible and balanced. In the West, there are so many ways the entrepreneurs are befooling the ordinary people. (inaudible....) we should be committed.But we are crazy and there are certain norms that we try to always follow. Like  first time we went to London, we never used to offer drinks in our house in India, but in London, they said that you have to offer. So to get six tumblers for every sort of drink we had to spend, in those days, 900 pounds. In that amount, we would have got at least three dozen of silver tumblers.Real silver, handmade. But for every type of wine, there is a different type of a glass and if you don't do that way you are not elite. So also these norms are formed by these entrepreneurs to befool us. And they have also killed our individuality. Because say, today is the fashion in Paris, then the whole of Europe must wear the same thing. You all look the same. If they have to wear tight pants they all will wear tight pants. All are just the same, just like a military. So we also have to understand how far we have to go, to balance between machinery and handmade things, and how many things to own, so that the piles and piles of plastics, nylons and all this horrible stuff is all over. You do not know what to do with it. Now if the machinery output is reduced what will happen is that ecological problems will be very much reduced. Say in India we have a such a big population no doubt, but the ecological problem is very little.No problem. Only the cities, some cities, because people have  say one plate of brass, which is sufficient for their life. So one has to be satisfied souls. But above all, once a person gets Realisation he becomes a medium of this divine power which starts flowing through him, and that triggers the atmosphere to be cleansed out. We have experimented with trees and we have found out that if they are given vibrated water then they survive very well despite the acid rain. We have experimented with agriculture and agriculture has improved ten times when you use vibrated water. And we don't use also, the seeds which we have to take from some organisation because they are hybrid. We use non-hybrid seeds. Also from non-hybrid animals, we get milk much more, their growth much better. So many things can happen.Everything living can be improved through these vibrations, the Chaitanya all pervading power. We spend all this money,we run around too much,we work so hard, for what? For joy. But if you see, it is all joyless pursuit. Your Spirit is the source of joy. It is the source of absolute truth. And it is the one that makes your attention so beautifully dynamic. And you become holy people. Auspicious people. The marriages become auspicious and the society improves. What is the culture we see in the West is that we change our wives and husbands like we change our dresses. And the children become like orphans. All kinds of struggles and all kinds of fights come out of hatred, but when you start using the power of love you are surprised how powerful you are. So the Sahaja yoga is not only for physical nor only for emotional or mental stability but for the stability of the whole world. So the new race of enlightened people have to come to lead the whole world into enlightenment. So it is a very easy method, it is very spontaneous because it is a living process. And now we are going to try it that, for all of you.Thank you very much. (clapping)

And if you have any questions you can write to us. Like you have here so many lights and you have to just switch on and you get all the lights spontaneously. But if I have to tell you all the theories behind it and then the discovery of it, all the rest of it, you will be fed-up. So the best thing is to have your realisation, and then we can talk about it.

At the very outset, I have to request you that you have to take out your shoes because we will take the help of mother earth. We will hardly take about 10 minutes.Please put your left hand towards me like this. This is suggesting symbolically you want your Realisation. Because the Left side is the power of desire. And the right hand we will have to use for the action. Dr Spiro will show you how to do it. Alright, now you have to put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit.Then you have to put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We will be working on the left hand side. Then you have to put your right hand on the lower portion of the abdomen. Now the upper portion of the abdomen is the centre of your mastery. All the great prophets and masters have created this centre within you. Now the lower.....
