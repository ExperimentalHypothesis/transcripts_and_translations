1988-0813 Musical Evening, Givrins Ashram, Switzerland

I was just telling him that you have created the great [ Ghot Indian word?] of the Adi Shakti here.And all the great minstrels of God called as Gandharvas and Yakshas and all of them are here. I wish you could take a photograph. I can see all of them in the sky feeling that "look at these great musicians". I think they are a little jealous also.
