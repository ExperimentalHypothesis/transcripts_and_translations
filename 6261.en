New Year Puja, Kalwe, India. 31 December 2000.

Now, we are starting a New Year, and I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.

(Applause)

In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very deep growth in Sahaja Yoga. (Applause)
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga. For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am sure you are doing meditation, introspection and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals, I should say. In this New Year, I'll think there is greater chance for you to do much better, because all those years of ordeals are over. (Applause) We are now entering into the New Era. I say now the Satya Yuga is established.

(Applause)

In the beginning you may not feel the atmosphere of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely. Of course gradually you'll find that's all clearing out and all the people who are dangerous for your spiritual life, for your national life, for your family life, will have to take back their way; they cannot be successful here. (Applause)

Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over. How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga? There should be many more waiting for you this year, and maybe this year, if you all decide to work it out, I am sure you can get lots of people who will be saved from the curses of Kali Yuga. This is going to be your vow on the New Year day, that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga in a new way, in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

For that, first thing is needed is your Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity. This collectivity has to be extremely well built-in, well made, well understood and absolutely loveable. This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga, because practically all your jealousies, all your baser ideas have been completely washed out by your Kundalini. She has transformed you, you are different people; you are very, very different. Not only that, but you have now understood yourselves. You are knowing your Self. And all those who know their self cannot fight with each other. Because this Self is the reflection of one person, of one Deity, of one God. And so how can you fight? When He is within your heart, how can you fight with each other? Otherwise you'll be fighting with yourself. It would be very, very stupid to do that. So all the fights and all the funny things that you have been thinking about will of course disappear, no doubt. But you'll become very dynamic. You'll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you have to rise; just you have to expect your Self to manifest. You can become very, very collective, progressive and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

You have been given Realization; you have been given the knowledge of Realization; whatever was possible has been done for your health and prosperity, but now it's your duty to repay to the Divine by your creative methods. You have to be very creative. You will find so many people in this world are full of lots of problems, which you have got out of it. But you can help them. You don't need any help because you are yourself full of power - power of Divinity within you. This Divine power should be used. It's not given just to be rusted. This power has to be used. Otherwise what's the use of becoming powerful? Supposing we have electrical power here, and it doesn't even give light, so what's the use of having electrical power? So the power that you have is for the emancipation of human beings. It is for you to raise the Kundalini of people - you can do it. One person can do it for thousands! And I hope now you take up this responsibility upon yourself. This would be the greatest blessing for you, for Sahaja Yoga and for the whole world. Because in My vision, we have to change the whole world. I don't know in My lifetime if I can achieve it or not. But if you people really join hands with Me, with full effort, it will work out.

Firstly I hear many people don't go to meditation, into collective meditation. They do not join together. It's surprising after so many years of work I've done - 30 years I've been working, and there are some people who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don't understand your responsibility. You have to meditate collectively. Whenever there is collective meditation you must join that. You can also start something in your areas, a collective meditation. And it will work out. Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga are now meditating, I can make them out. I know who are the ones who are meditating and who are not. It's not difficult to make it out.

And then you come out with other problems like my mother's, father's, uncle's - this thing. There's no need to worry about that. Even if you are a realized soul, and when you are connected with the Divine, even your own wish will be fulfilled. But it does not. Why? Because you still do not understand what you have become. You first try giving Realizations to others. See what joy you feel. Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get in anything else. Whatever you may buy, whatever you may have, you cannot get this joy of giving Realization. And you will be so very happy; not because you expect anything, you want anything, nothing of the kind - but only thing is pure joy - pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis. This is what you are here for. This is what the Divine wants you to do. Not just to take advantage of Divine power: "Cure my father, cure my mother, cure my sister... " or else, "I haven't got properties ..." Then somebody says, "My husband ill-treats me..." or some wife says that.... so the husband says that..... It's going on and on and on. Forget it! You are now above everything, above all these things. And you have become absolutely powerful, believe Me. If you haven't used your power, then how will you know what powers you have got? It's as simple as that. Those who have used it go on telling Me what miracles they had, what things have happened to them, how they were protected, whatever they wanted - how they got it.

But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy, Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows you are a hypocritical. It is for your good, for your growth you have to be in Sahaja Yoga. It's not for somebody else that you are doing it, but for yourself. When people are that powerful I am amazed, how they easily they can get cured. But they must meditate, and they must join collective meditation. Most of the people don't join collective meditation. I am surprised. I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is no sufficient space, so people have to come twice, either Saturday or Sunday; some of them have to wait outside - doesn't matter. But going for the collective meditation, you'll be amazed that Divinity is flowing there. Vibrations are flowing there. I am there. It's not that you are just going there just as a ritual.

Problem is you people don't realize that you have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga, responsible for giving Realizations to others and attend all the programs you have of meditation. With collective meditation you get all right. All your problems are solved if you go to the collective meditation regularly - I promise you! But the problem is you won't go; you will write letters to Me, you want to meet Me. This is not going to help. You may come and trouble Me like that, or do something like that, but doesn't help. What helps that you help yourself. Next year is going to be a great year for you.

In the West now I was surprised how things are spreading fast. In Russia the people are so deep - so deep. Once they get Realization, they understand the value of Realization. They are so humble, and so deep, they don't want anything. They've never desired for anything. Though they have gone through horrible problems of communism, and now this reaction to that. Despite that, all these five countries which I call as 'real' Divine countries, because the way they have accepted it. They are poor according to the modern standards, but from their heart they are very, very rich. From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga, they are very, very rich. And their scientists are so well qualified. In every type of thing now, there is one scientist who has come to India and who has discovered a method by which you can see all the chakras, and the Kundalini and the obstructions and everything - something he can show you.

While our scientists are busy opposing Me. Little knowledge is very dangerous. They don't want to see what I am doing and how I am doing it. They just want to criticize Me - all so-called intellectuals. Especially in Maharashtra, the intellectuals - I think they are something has gone wrong with their heads. They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just beyond them. What has happened to them I don't know, but they just can't understand Sahaja Yoga. And these Maharashtrians are so busy with their rituals. Four o'clock in the morning they'll get up, take their baths, do this, then start doing their Pujas, this, that. Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes to Me, "We didn't go to any temple, we didn't do any rituals, still my husband has got sick." Imagine. As if doing by that you mean you are a Sahaja Yogi. If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing can happen to you. But you have been just under wrong impression. Whether you go to temple, or whether you go to wrong places and do all kinds of rituals - it has never helped anyone.

So first you have to empty yourself. If you are already filled with these ideas, these age old ideas, and you are still carrying on with them, how can the Divine be filled? If there's a pot already full of water or anything - you cannot fill it. So you have to empty it completely. Empty yourself, empty your mind. It's possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra. By not reacting! Reaction is the worst thing, because reaction comes through your Agnya, as I told you the other day, and it is due to your conditioning or due to your ego. So some people react because of their conditioning, and some people react because of their ego. So why should you react to anything? Why don't you enjoy - by not reacting. You just watch. See how beautifully they have made beautiful flowers - just enjoy it. What is the need - some will find some faults, somebody will say this should not have been there, how did they manage this, all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy of its creation is there. And you should be able to see it, feel it, enjoy it. Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise you are not. If you are a reacting type, you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

This is a degree - Sahaja Yoga is - I think there are so many various styles of Sahaja Yogis. Somebody is just minor, somebody a little plus, somebody's like that. But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is to be measured by the way he keeps joyous and happy. Goes on criticizing others, go on getting angry with others, all these things are going on, and he thinks he's a Sahaja Yogi. In our Divine University we have no degrees, we don't give you certificates, you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got your Realization. If the Kundalini has burst opened here (Shri Mataji puts Her hand over Her Sahasrara) - it's all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real Sahaja Yogi. It only depends when you are joyous and you are anxious to give Realizations to others. You want to share your Realization, you just don't want to keep it to yourself. If that is not your condition, then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi. You should find out how many people you have given Realization. It's very important. Because next year, as I've said, is a very important, very, very important year. In that year I would like to see all of you going round and giving Realization.

While I've seen all these other false gurus who are getting exposed one by one. If you see their attitude, anywhere you meet them - once I was travelling by plane and there was a lady sitting next to Me, she was so hot. So I asked her, "What guru do you follow?" So she told Me the name. She said "He's very good, this guru is the best" .... this and that. Such heat coming from her body! I never said anything, but I was amazed how this lady was proudly talking about her guru who is such a bad man - and without knowing Me, I was just a stranger to her. But Sahaja Yogis don't talk about it. You should talk to your neighbors, you should talk in your circle.

Like, we have in India so many customs when we meet people: Like in India we do haldi kumkum in Maharashtra. They will never talk to those women who come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga. They won't even have My photograph. If they want, they can do it. But they are - I don't know what are they frightened about. It's a very good chance. You have any dinner, you have any public meeting, anything. They won't talk about Sahaja Yoga. It's very surprising. They don't want to talk about Sahaja Yoga that, "We have got this through Sahaja Yoga." So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

One has to understand you all should find out how much responsible you have been for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course, you are all protected, you are all blessed, everyone has got whatever they wanted. Most of them. But how many of them are returning this debt? How many are working to give Realization to others? This is a debt on you. But if your attention is haphazard, if your attention is not clear, is not nirmal, then you are involved into all kinds of things like the tentacles of an octopus. You become like an octopus, you go on getting attached to this, attached to that, attached to that. You have to be a free bird. All these attachments that you have are going to take you nowhere. You should be only attached to Sahaja Yoga and should be conscious that you have known yourself. If you can just understand your value, your level, I can tell you - we can change the whole world!

We have such a good heritage in this country; we have such good culture in this country. I have seen the problems of America and other places, we don't have these problems. At least they're not so prevalent. But only the thing that we have to do is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi. Like a tree - when it grows, it knows it's a tree. It knows it has to produce roots, it has not come up 'like that'. It has not been brought up just like a stick, no. It has to do something. In this world everything has to do something. But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It's such a rare thing to happen that you have got your Realization. So where should we waste out attention? Why should we neglect our meditation? Why? We have to grow, we are a different people. We are a different race altogether in this world. We are realized souls. There were hardly any number during the time of Christ, practically nil. And even before that I was surprised that in China and other places, in one age there used to be one guru - one master. While you are so many masters, but you don't want to use your power as a master. Why not the women use it also? I find women are more lethargic than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should show - I am a woman myself, single-handed I've done all this work; and why shouldn't you do it? Because it's a tremendous task to transform people all over the world.

But it's very easy for you - if I can do it, why can't you do it? But put your complete attention to it that: 'We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga, not for ourselves, but for the betterment of humanity.' We need it, we need it very much. Your compassion, your love, is all being wasted if you just think about yourself, your family - what's the use? People do that even before Realization. So what is the use of completely getting attached to your families, attached to all other things? You should get attached to the whole world! You belong to the whole world now, you are no more individualistic. No more!

Now, as I said, it's a drop has become the ocean. Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is the lowest, if you have seen, lowest so much that the zero point starts from the ocean. Ocean is so humble. It's the lowest point - it lives, but all the rivers flow into it. And the ocean does the work of throwing clouds in the sky. And these then burst and become rain falling to the same ocean. They come back to the same ocean. So those who are humble will attract more Sahaja Yogis. Those who are kind will attract much more Sahaja Yogis.

So it is important to see that you change your temperament. If you try to show off, nobody is going to be impressed by you. If you think you are something very great, nobody is going to look at you. Be very humble, kind, generous - also very joyous person. Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group and telling them, "See, my mother is sick, my father is dying and this thing is happening, but I am doing Sahaja Yoga." So people will say, "Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then? You go and cry and weep and sit down there!" If he's really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no sickness can come, no trouble can come. It is a fact. Try to understand. It's you who will lead these people who are supposed to be there, they will rise. But no use having identification with people who are not Sahaja Yogis. They may be your relations, they may be anything. No use, because you are at a different level, they are at a different level. Either try to raise their level, or have nothing to do with them, because they will pull you down. They will not see your height, they have no eyes to see, they have no ear to hear, and they have no feelings of any kind. If they have seen how you are changed, how your life is changed, they would have gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga. But if they are not, that's not your job. You shouldn't bother about them. If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good, otherwise they are no your relations. In no way they are related to you. How will you relate Sahaja Yoga to them? How will you explain anything to them? It's going to be impossible to talk to these people.

So what I have to tell you today is that our family which is Sahaja Yoga, is large, it's spread in 86 countries, and it's doing very well. But what we have to see - that you do belong to that ocean, to the great families of Sahaja Yoga. But it is for you to increase the size of this. You have to increase, you have to talk about it, and you have to change people. This is your responsibility. You were not given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing, you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis, better Sahaja Yogis; and you yourself meditate, not only meditate but also attend all the collective programs as far as possible.

I am happy the way you have stayed on and have come here. It has rained - still you are here and you still are enjoying the Divine bliss. I again and again bless you from my heart, and I want you to have that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini, (Applause) want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is the pure desire, not only to become Sahaja Yogis but to create more Sahaja Yogis. That is actually your pure desire. You may not have recognized it, but unless and until you fulfill that desire, you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi. It's to spread Sahaja Yoga in every level in everywhere, in every one - that you can do it. And it will spread very well, and so many people can be saved. So many people who are just lost in the maya of stupidity will be back on the right path. How much good you are going to do for them you just think. If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja Yogis, why can't you also try and get more Sahaja Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga. The whole problem - whenever I see newspaper, I think, 'Oh God, if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there would have been no problem'. But I find that still people are roaming about, and going round and round, I don't know, as if they have no brains or they've no understanding that 'where is this world going?' and 'Who's going to save this world?'

I am not here to tell you what you should do in your private life. But you yourself should know to keep yourself cleansed and beautiful, what you have to do to yourself. Some people are so superficial that it doesn't go into their heads. Sahaja Yoga just doesn't go into their heads - very, very superficial. So forget them. I don't think they can be saved. So forget them, they cannot enjoy. They are worried about some nonsensical things always. So with such people you need not - but there are still so many people, at least I think 80% people, who are seeking and you should give them help.

This is one thing, is the desire of your Mother that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga upon yourself and go on telling about this to everyone who comes. I mean I don't want cheap popularity, but I do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.

(Shri Mataji continues in Marathi - translation)

Now to speak in Marathi is that at our place, especially women keep in memory about all festivals and they are perfectly performing all things accordingly. (They) will get up early in morning at 4 o’clock, will take bath then after filling heater with water (they) will sit; for what? For worshipping and we peoples are so much ritualistic that its better there in Delhi. There people don’t have rituals due to which so many lacs got their realization. But in Maharashtra it’s not possible. There(In Maharashtra) you must go to Pandhari (Padharpur- place with Shri Vitthala Rukmini temple) while playing “Tal”(one instrument used for rhythm while singing bhajan’s) and once you go to Pandhari, then you don’t get realization. Actually you should get realization, but those peoples who go to Pandhari don’t get their realization. Otherwise where are they going carrying such a big pot of Tulasi (one plant) on head? To Alandi (one temple with Samadhi of Shri Saint Dnyanshwara)! (But) for what? Who has told you? Whether (Saint) Dnyaneshwara told this? He was not having even sleepers in his legs, but they are carrying his “Palakhi” and coming. They will carry his “Palakhi” and go on eating food at each village. Means don’t have any self respect.”

“In the name of Dnyaneshwara (they) will go to each village and will go on eating and what villagers are saying that ‘Wow! We did such a religious work’. Oh,These peoples are beggars! Are beggars! In the name of Dnyadeva they are begging, why are you feeding them? By feeding such beggars what benefit you will have? Like this many businesses are going on in Maharashtra. They are not finishing at all. (We can) see those on the way here or there. So all this should be ended now. Not only you but tell this to others also , ‘What this stupidity is going on? Why are you doing all this? In which science this has been written? Did Dnyanadeva have written this? Why are you doing this?’ We have to leave all this. Now you organize “haldi kunku” functions. Have you ever told about Sahajayoga in this function? When they (other married women) come, then give them “oti”, do this, do that. Now if somebody gets married then they give “oti” for me. I told them, ‘Don’t give me oti’ then they were saying ‘Mataji, we (give to) Devi.’ Then go (and) offer to Devi, not me. I don’t want.”

“What you do is to do Sahajayoga. Offering oti, what can happen by offering oti? No way it’s beneficial to me and nor to you..... If you want to offer oti to Devi then go and offer in temple. But (now) stop all this. Already (you) have done a lot. Now go inside. You have so much wealth inside. Grab it and here we were having so many saints and sages and what they teach us? Do they teach this to us? Now first of all, stop all rituals and about that also (you) don’t have much knowledge. Just follow something, somebody; some custom followed by mama papa and just go on following same. Then with them self (women) drag men also in that. A woman is having more wisdom than man and she is nourishing society. But if such bhoots are entered in her then , (suppose) if some Brahmin comes and tell her , ‘lady yours is like this’, then finished. Due to this children’s are also spoiled. Just wasting time here and there. So nobody will go for “haldi kunku” and if that lady inviting or “haldi kunku” is going to teach Sahajayoga, then only will go to “haldi kunku” otherwise will not go. (You) must strongly decide this.”

“Only I need Sahajayoga or you also need and not for other peoples? For them why don’t you tell? There you will not tell that ‘We are Sahajayogi’s and what we have got (from this)?’ Due to influence of women or whatever it may be, same with men. So here in our Maharashtra there are 2 kinds of peoples. Either they are ritualistic or an intellectuals, means idiotic still intellectuals and due to intelligence it does not penetrate into their heads that, What Sahajayoga is. They feel that it’s some other kind of hypocrisy. Oh but, first you try this. Understand this. That’s why you will be surprised but the growth of Maharashtra is lowest and in this Maharashtra I toil hard. I have visited and worked in so many villages. Even after working years after year; still Maharashtra has not reached to that level. What is this? What’s the reason for this? I feel that you absolutely leave rituals. It’s not needed. No need of this and another thing is that for men; don’t use too much intelligence. Oh, where is the intelligence? If all intelligence takes you like this on wrong path then what’s use of such intelligence? In Maharashtra these intellectuals are worst than ritualistic peoples. Means those are lost. Gone astray. It’s difficult for them to come back as everywhere there is ego. (they feel) We mean something special! No incarnation can come in these peoples. So because of such peoples, in such donkey’s; why an incarnation will come? They have made some misconceptions about ourselves(themselves) and these intellectuals have done such stupidity which don’t have any limits. Never tried to understand anything, not listen anything. In this way how it will get assimilated inside?”
“So now this flow of intelligence which has come in Maharashtra is more dangerous. Books after books are written. Whatever comes is too much and peoples will say that ‘we read this in book’. Oh, whether only truth is written in books every time? Who are these peoples who are writing? What experience they have got? You must tell stressfully to these peoples that we don’t agree this! Worthless things. Going on criticizing everybody. Criticizing Shri Rama, criticizing Shri Krishna, if not any other then will go on criticizing those all saints and sages who were there and then will say that all this is blind faith. Oh, you don’t have any faith then from where blind faith will come? That person who has faith in own self will only get stable in Sahajayoga. Why that person who doesn’t have faith about himself will come into Sahajayoga?”

“Therefore find out such(having faith in themselves) peoples. Such very excellent peoples are also there in our country. You have to help them. I feel in Maharashtra specially have (such excellent peoples). It’s much needed to work here. We are very intelligent in quarreling. Therefore in politics also we are often quarreling, quarreling, quarreling. But in Sahajayoga how many people are there who will passionately achieve the aim; whatever it may be? If there is one leader then will go on pointing out something wrong in him, (saying) ‘Mataji it’s like this, it’s like that.’ All right even if we remove him then also about other things also much. (Will say) ‘ My grandmother who is with me is sick’. Oh, must be she is aged and even if she is sick, let it be. Why did you go there? Who is ‘my grandmother?’ Whole world is your grandmother. Whole world is your relatives. You are a Sahajayogi. ‘Your grandmother’, ‘your father’,’ your mother’ how this could happen? You have come to world level. Your level has been changed, isn’t it? Your relatives have been changed.”
“In ancient times it was like Brahmins will marry Brahmin only. Other caste’s peoples will get marry in that caste only. But is it still now like this? All is mixed now. Then why Sahajayogi’s should keep this in mind that,this is my Mother and that is your Mother? Mine, yours all this is finished, now whole world is yours. Whether Dnyaneshwara said like this? We were having so many saints and sages. Whether Tukarama said like this? Whether any of them ever did like this ‘my’, ‘yours’? Just from morning (you) go on singing, mugging up poems of these saints, but its meaning never enters into (your) head. So now by leaving all this one should be honest with himself that ‘what I am doing this with me? What shall I do for myself?’ We have to see, ‘What I want to do?’ and then after doing that you will understand and you will come in light. Oh, you are a Sahajayogi. Whether there were so many Sahajayogi’s before in this world? There were 2-4 and they also suffered a lot, still they wrote so many beautiful poems. You have come to such a great country, which is having its name itself “Maharashtra”. And after coming here why are you becoming like Frog (small or close hearted)? Now leave these relatives and Shri Dnyaneshwara has told that“natlag techi hechi soyare hoti”. He has clearley told that ‘Your relatives are these. Nobody else is our relatives.’ But this should come into your attention! Just go on reading‘Pasaydan (poem written by Shri Dnyanshwara)’. Once it’s mugged up then finished. “Samor path mage sapat” (meaning just mugging up and don’t practice according to its meaning).
So Maharashtrian peoples should see towards themselves with laughing attitude that what I am doing? What is my duty?”

“You come and see there in Delhi. There 2-3 Maharashtrian who were very nice came there. So they (Delhi Sahajayogis) were saying that ‘(Shri) Mataji, you ask peoples from Maharashtra to come here. They are very nice. I said ‘Oh is it so? Then you go and see there for some days then you will understand.’ To grow deep in Sahajayoga it needs efforts. I am not saying that ‘you go to Himalayas and stand on one leg.’ No. But you have to see that, where I am going? What I am doing? For what I am living? Then there are blessings and blessings. But for blessings also you have to fully open Sahasrara. You have value yourself (respect yourself). We don’t understand value of our self. Don’t know what has happennned in our society that we don’t understand value of our self. You must strongly decide in heart in mind that ‘I can do this. I can do that’ and should see big dreams that ‘I will go in this village. I will go there.’ Like this you have to see dreams, have to create new ideas.”

“Now already (during earlier times) so much work has been done here. In earlier days there was Queen of Jhansi. She was a woman still she said that I will make British defeated. With her small child she went to battlefield and sacrificed her life. Still British said that ‘Though we win Jhansi but the glory goes to Laxmibai.’ Now like these women’s were there in Maharashtra and now we cannot see like this. All is just making up (show off). Why I am saying this because I got very bad experiences. Now peoples are saying that “We don’t want Maharashtrian wife.” These (girls) went there and brought bad name. It’s better that in Marathi language anything you talk, these peoples don’t understand. But still you should understand that they brought bad name by their behavior to Maharashtra and now they don’t want Maharashtrian wife. Now they (girls) don’t have education still I marry them why, because are better for me. But they throw away me only. Why I am telling this because until now I never told you mistakes. Always I said all good things about you, but now this will not continue. Now I want to see something very strong before me. Therefore when next time I will be there I will ask everybody that, ‘ how many people’s you have given self realisation.’”
“In a way you are better than Guajarati’s. They are very dumb peoples. Sahajayoga don’t go into their head and even if it penetrates in your head still it’s just wastage. So now today have determination inside that ‘(Shri) Mataji next time when you will come then we will show you what can happen in Maharashtra.’ Oh, where are those Mavlas (soldiers of King Shivaji, warrior men from Maharashtra)? I don’t understand what has happened. They were Mavla’s , still they did so much of work and you are well educated, good, all right peoples still you cannot do anything for us. So now this number has to be increased and not only this but you also have to grow deep and I should be able to say that ‘In Maharashtra Sahajayoga has spread spread alot that there is no more scope. Now there are no other words to say about.’ So this should happen. You just make me not needed to talk anymore. If this happens then I will feel so nice.”

“I was born here and had all my education in Marathi language. Now also I know Marathi very well. But I cannot understand mind of Marathi peoples. I cannot understand mind of Marathi peoples because my father was of very high qualities. My mother was of very high quality. With them I was not known that in Maharashtra also have such types. So now you have to show me that ‘Mataji, we are very special. Now you have given so much responsibility on us and we will also show that Maharashtra also don’t have any lacuna.’ You are great warriors. But also you have to become capable for that warrior ship. What’s the use of just calling by Maratha? ‘Maharashtrian means finished’ like this peoples are now having prejudiced ideas in their mind. So this should not happen. So now understand Sahajayoga completely. Make it practice and bring good name for Maharashtra. This my speech with infinite blessings for you. Accept this.
