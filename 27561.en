I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. You cannot pay for it. You cannot conceptualize it. It is an experience of truth. So, whatever I’m going to tell you today, you have to treat it as a hypothesis. Please, don’t believe it blindly. If it is proved that it is true, then you have to believe in it as honest people. Because it is for the benevolence of the whole world and for transformation. It is the most important thing that we will have to know what is the truth. The truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings and this ego. But it is that you are the pure Spirit;

The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power which does all the living work. This is the power of divine love. It is called by many names that in Quran, it is called as ‘Ruh’. In the Bible, it is called as the All-pervading Power of God's Love. And in Sanskrit scriptures, it is called as Paramchaitanya.

You see all these beautiful flowers here and we take them for granted. We don’t even think what a miracle it is. From one small seed, such beauty has been created. Who does all this? Who runs our heart? They say, it is the automatic nervous system. But who is this ‘Auto’?

So now, we must now understand that there is something beyond our normal conception, beyond human awareness, which we have to know. Today, we see the present situation in the world; we are shocked. The way people are going down in so many ways, destroying themselves from within. What is the quality of life? Look at America which is supposed to be a very developed democracy, 65% of people of America, will be suffering from schizophrenia. Everywhere people are under stress and strain. Affluent countries, even Switzerland and other countries, as you know, of the Scandinavian countries, people are competing in how to commit suicide. We have AIDS and we have many other secret diseases, we have no solutions to them.

Diseases like cancer and so many in the sense that we diseases that we don’t know how we get them. Where are our children going? If you see the whole situation of the Western society, we are in great trouble. And the security of people is uncertain. At this time, they are many people who are intelligent. I’m thinking about them. Those who are worried and concerned are thinking about it.

So, you come to religions. And what do we find? Fundamentalism. Muslims are openly fundamentalists. But what about the whole Catholic people? And the whole [unclear] Christians, what are they? In both [unclear] Muslims. They have nothing to do with Christ. The Catholic church made artificial dollars, man-made dollars and distributed it to their church.Translator: Sorry?Shri Mataji: Catholic church made, you see, artificial dollars, man-made, and distributed it to their church. Can you imagine? So many people are killed, so many people are finished to hide these things. The whole Catholic religion has come from Paul, not from Christ.

I was also born in a Christian religion. And I could see through and through who is this mister Paul, really. He got hold of Peter who was the worse disciple of Christ. And Christ has said that, "The devil will take you up, The Satan will take you up". So this Paul took over. He took over and he completely destroyed Christ’s life and his message. And we cannot see, and we don’t intend even to see, in 2000 years, what this religion has done to you? What has it brought to you? It did not make you evolve. All religions are like this.Even Hindu religions has so many problems. But thanks God, we had so many sages, there’s not one book.

So, people started correcting [unsure], one after the other. But here you cannot sell it as we are saints. You just have to listen and to obey and get nothing out of it. You are taxed, you are giving money, you give money all the time, for what?I read that in London, so many priests, the high priests have abused of children. Then here, it went to Austria, there were some priests, what they did, do you know? They carried on with married women and they created children. And so many of them! When they were asked, "Why did you do it? Why don’t you marry? " The answer of [unclear], "We don’t because we’ll have to pay a pension". Such stupid things, you believe, have we [unsure] lost our intelligence!

Thanks God, in these modern times, they are many intelligent people. And they think, they understand, but there is no way of taking up to truth. . They don’t know how to work it out. It is such a [unclear], that it’s impossible to tell anyone, "This is wrong".Anyone who calls himself a priest cannot behave like this. Anybody who calls himself a priest cannot behave like this. So, where do we go?

Why do we think like this? What is the solution? I s there a solution for that? There is. Actually, all these great religions were born to the same tree of spirituality. All are beautiful flowers and these beautiful flowers were taken away by the people who are in charge. They are [unclear] . So, what can you do about it? They are fighting with their flowers saying, "It’s mine; mine. This is mine which is the best". Another is saying, "It is mine which is the best". How can there be differences in any religion if there is one God? This is how the fundamentalism works;
