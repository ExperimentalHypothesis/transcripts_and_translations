I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. You cannot pay for it. You cannot conceptualize it. It is an experience of truth. So, whatever I’m going to tell you today, you have to treat it as a hypothesis. Please, don’t believe it blindly. If it is proved that it is true, then you have to believe in it as honest people. Because it is for the benevolence of the whole world and for transformation. It is the most important thing that we will have to know what is the truth. The truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings and this ego. But it is that you are the pure Spirit;

Today, we see the present situation in the world; we are shocked. The way people are going down in so many ways, destroying themselves from within. What is the quality of life? Look at America which is supposed to be a very developed democracy, 65% of people of America, will be suffering from schizophrenia. Everywhere people are under stress and strain. Affluent countries, even Switzerland and other countries, as you know, of the Scandinavian countries, people are competing in how to commit suicide. We have AIDS and we have many other secret diseases, we have no solutions to them.
