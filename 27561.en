Sorry. Please, you have to translate. I‘m sorry, I don’t know German language.
|Unclear conversation about the mike]

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. You cannot pay for it. You cannot conceptualize it. It is an experience of truth. So, whatever I’m going to tell you today, you have to treat it as a hypothesis. Please, don’t believe it blindly. If it is proved that it is true, then you have to believe in it as honest people. Because it is for the benevolence of the whole world and for transformation. It is the most important thing that we will have to know what is the truth. The truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings and this ego. But it is that you are the pure Spirit.

The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power which does all the living work. This is the power of divine love. It is called by many names that in Quran, it is called as ‘Ruh’. In the Bible, it is called as the All-pervading Power of God's Love. And in Sanskrit scriptures, it is called as Paramchaitanya.

You see all these beautiful flowers here and we take them for granted. We don’t even think what a miracle it is. From one small seed, such beauty has been created. Who does all this? Who runs our heart? They say, it is the automatic nervous system. But who is this ‘Auto’?

So now, we must now understand that there is something beyond our normal conception, beyond human awareness, which we have to know. Today, we see the present situation in the world; we are shocked. The way people are going down in so many ways, destroying themselves from within. What is the quality of life? Look at America which is supposed to be a very developed democracy, 65% of people of America, will be suffering from schizophrenia. Everywhere people are under stress and strain. Affluent countries, even Switzerland and other countries, as you know, of the Scandinavian countries, people are competing in how to commit suicide. We have AIDS and we have many other secret diseases, we have no solutions to them.

Diseases like cancer and so many in the sense that we diseases that we don’t know how we get them. Where are our children going? If you see the whole situation of the Western society, we are in great trouble. And the security of people is uncertain. At this time, they are many people who are intelligent. I’m thinking about them. Those who are worried and concerned are thinking about it.

So, you come to religions. And what do we find? Fundamentalism. Muslims are openly fundamentalists. But what about the whole Catholic people? And the whole [unclear] Christians, what are they? In both [unclear] Muslims. They have nothing to do with Christ. The Catholic church made artificial dollars, man-made dollars and distributed it to their church.
Translator: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: Catholic church made, you see, artificial dollars, man-made, and distributed it to their church. Can you imagine? So many people are killed, so many people are finished to hide these things. The whole Catholic religion has come from Paul, not from Christ.

I was also born in a Christian religion. And I could see through and through who is this mister Paul, really. He got hold of Peter who was the worse disciple of Christ. And Christ has said that, "The devil will take you up, The Satan will take you up". So this Paul took over. He took over and he completely destroyed Christ’s life and his message. And we cannot see, and we don’t intend even to see, in 2000 years, what this religion has done to you? What has it brought to you? It did not make you evolve. All religions are like this.
Even Hindu religions has so many problems. But thanks God, we had so many sages, there’s not one book.

So, people started correcting [unsure], one after the other. But here you cannot sell it as we are saints. You just have to listen and to obey and get nothing out of it. You are taxed, you are giving money, you give money all the time, for what?
I read that in London, so many priests, the high priests have abused of children. Then here, it went to Austria, there were some priests, what they did, do you know? They carried on with married women and they created children. And so many of them! When they were asked, "Why did you do it? Why don’t you marry? " The answer of [unclear], "We don’t because we’ll have to pay a pension". Such stupid things, you believe, have we [unsure] lost our intelligence!

Thanks God, in these modern times, they are many intelligent people. And they think, they understand, but there is no way of taking up to truth. . They don’t know how to work it out. It is such a [unclear], that it’s impossible to tell anyone, "This is wrong".Anyone who calls himself a priest cannot behave like this. So, where do we go?

Why do we think like this? What is the solution? I s there a solution for that? There is. Actually, all these great religions were born to the same tree of spirituality. All are beautiful flowers and these beautiful flowers were taken away by the people who are in charge. They are [unclear] . So, what can you do about it? They are fighting with their flowers saying, "It’s mine; mine. This is mine which is the best". Another is saying, "It is mine which is the best". How can there be differences in any religion if there is one God? This is how the fundamentalism works.

But you should not accept anything in these modern times as science, whatever is not handleably. Whatever they say has to be tangible. Of course, science cannot give the answer because it is immoral. It deals with matter. So, to take the answer or to ask for answer, first of all, we must know, we are honest about it and we have a pure desire to know what is the truth. These evolution, so-called religions have not given no [unclear]. But still, the Divine knows its purpose [unsure]. You are one with it, despite you don’t know his purpose. You are human beings [unclear] his purpose. And that’s why you are thinking that there has to be a solution. These are the seekers.

William Blake has said that men of God will be born in those days. They will find the Divine and they will make others divine. All these great wise men were thought to be mad. In England, for example, they thought William Blake was a mad man. In a mad house, everybody thinks all the sane people are mad. It is now time to use our intelligence, our superior intelligence which is not conditioned, which is not blind, which has to see everything that is tangible.

This power which is in the sacrum bone is within all of us. You all have this divine chance. It just waits to be awakened. Once it is awakened, it passes through the six centres, as you see, last on is here (at the top of the head), the fontanelle bone area. And it is the actualization of the experience of the divine Power. It is not just a sermon or a lecture. But it is a happening. Then when it happens, you just get connected. You are connected. The yoga takes place with this the All-pervading Power. It is your birthright. You have been bestowed with it. It is just there and you are going to get the blessings. It’s very simple and spontaneous. What do we do when we want to plant a seed? Just plant it into Mother Earth.
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

So, this seed sprouts automatically because it is built in, built in the seed. And built in the Mother Earth so that it can sprout. It is something, something that you don’t have to do anything about it. It’s already done. It’s all built in within you. So, you don’t have to do any effort, you don’t have to stand on your head.

Of course, there has been lost of Tantrikas and devils who said that, "Kundalini awakening gives you this and that". Nothing of the kind, really. None of the people that I have seen got this kind of horrible experiences in his life.
None of the ancient sages who wrote about it, it’s some sort of a Tantric nonsense.

Some Germen went to India, and what did they know about Kundalini? And I don’t know where they got all nonsensical reports. Such a big book I saw, written about Kundalini. They said, Kundalini is in the stomach. It is not. You can verify, everything.
It’s something [unclear].

As this instrument has to be connected to the mains. Otherwise, it has no meaning. In the same way, we are not connected to the mains. So, we have problems.
All the world problems mostly come from human beings, physical, mental, emotional, all kinds. All these problems come from the centres. Some way or another, you can correct these centres, nourish them and connect yourself to this All-pervading Power, then there is no problem. All the time this mighty power falls upon you. All your worries will be finished. So, you reach a stage by which you start feeling this All-pervading Power on your fingertips. Left hand, 5, 6 and 7. Right hand, 5, 6 and 7. These are the 7 centres.
Today I [unclear], you know that. These, for example, are functions connected to the three centres.

As if your whole being becomes electrified or enlightened with Divinity. You can feel it on your fingertips, your sympathetic centres. Right side is feeding your physical and mental side. Left side, you see, feeds your emotional side and mental, in a funny way.
So, when this Kundalini rises, she passes through these centres, she enlarges them, nourishes them, put them back in proper place. And ultimately, she pierces through the last centre, which gives you the actualization of your baptism. And you can yourself feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. Because kundalini is the Holy Ghost. She is the reflection of the primordial Mother, Athena.

Paul hated women. He talked about Christ’s Mother in a very, in very decorative ways. He called her ‘woman’. And, imagine, in Koran, Muhammad sahib has said, "Never to say a word against such a chaste woman". How can it be that a person like Muhammad sahib could see the Divinity in her? And he [Paul] was not married. So, just to condemn the women, [Paul] he has done all these kinds of nonsensical arguments. And they are so primitive that in England they were fighting to make a woman a priest!
But in India, the woman is the shakti. She is the power and respected. But she is respectable also.
This kind of stupid things, we have been following for years. I can’t understand, intelligent people, independent people, how can they accept such nonsense? We have to have our own understanding, that unless and until it should be proved, you are not going to accept it. And if you are accepting something blindly, then you are going to do that. But it cannot give you any results.

Understand that your live is very precious. We have not yet [unclear] to our lives. It is not to be wasted with all these nonsensical things like drugs and all kinds of diseases. In those days, in modern times, people who are born are very great people.
Translator: Sorry, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: In those days, in modern times, those who are born are very great people. And they just have to understand what is the value of human life.

It’s like, yesterday, I have told you that in a remote village of India, you take a television and tell them that, "In this box, you will see all the films." They won’t believe you. They will say, "What nonsense! This is just a box". But as soon as you connect it to the mains, they will see how fantastic it is, all the beautiful things built in, maybe in Germany. [Laughter]

That’s how fantastic you are! You think yourselves as a plastic box, but you are not. All this is within you. It’s your own, already built in. We have to open our eyes and see for ourselves. When this connection takes place, the first thing that happens to you that you start feeling the cool breeze on your own fingertips. This gives you an absolute truth.

There are many, from India, who came from the Jains to Germany, especially, I must say, wearing those Safran clothes. And they started in the [unclear]. And people start going [unclear] like this.
They don't know how cunning Indians could be, because they are very intelligent, over. And they started following it.
These are the ones who are prospering in these modern times. Because you don’t know how to discriminate! After getting your Realization, when you just put your hands towards these hypocrites and immediately, you’ll get triggering, or something heat on your fingertips and you’ll run away from them.

You will feel the vibrations of that person. Immediately, you’ll know that he is a cheater.
So, this is how you will know the absolute knowledge about everyone, about anything.
Say, if you have 10 children who are Realized soul and you cover their eyes and ask them, "What is this man suffering from?" You ask the children; they will all point out one finger. Maybe this (left small finger), maybe this (right index). Maybe this (right small finger);
which means something is wrong with your father or something wrong with you, that you don't treat your father with respect. And if you ask the person, "What is your relationship with your father?" He’ll say, "I don’t know." I mean, we know that on our fingertips. Somebody is suffering from cancer? You can know on your fingertips; you don't have to go to this diagnosis by which they half kill you. [Laughter]

Thus you become collectively conscious. You can feel the centres of another person. You become collectively conscious of a new dimension. A new dimension is born. And this new dimension makes you like a microcosm which becomes the macrocosm. Like a drop becomes the ocean.

So, the second great thing that happens to you is that you become one with the present moment.
You live in the past or in the future. The thoughts are coming from the past or from the future. And you are all the time jumping on the crests of the thoughts, the crests is the top of the thoughts. But between one thought, which rises and falls, another rises and falls, there is a space, that space is the present. The past doesn't exist. It's finished and the future doesn't exist at all. So, the present is important. When this Kundalini rises, she separates the thoughts and you become one with the present. So, there is no thought you are fully aware but there is no thought.
That give you peace within yourself. Whenever a thought comes in, you can see. But unless and until you are in the present, you cannot grow spiritually.

The most beautiful thing about this happening is that you jump into the ocean of joy. Then all these precarious spaces become bubbling with joy. It is not joy which is frivolous. But it is the joy of knowledge.
You become Gnostics. ‘GN’ in Sanskrit means knowledge. And you must be knowing how early Christians tortured the Gnostics, because they did not know them, these knowledgeable people who had the knowledge of the Divine.

This is what one has to get. By this your attention, attention becomes enlightened. The attention which is enlightened acts. The eyes become innocent. Innocence is never lost. You’ll be surprised, whatever you might have done, your innocence is not lost. It is always there, intact.
[Aside] Please don't disturb. Please don't disturb.
It is always intact. There are some clouds which are removed and your eyes become innocent.
Such innocence, such innocent eyes that even a glance acts. It gives goodness, peace, joy. And a person becomes righteous. You don't have to tell, "Don’t do this, don’t do that”. No, just he becomes. In the light of the Spirit, he sees clearly and he knows what’s, he knows what is right, what is wrong.

The greatest thing is you get, you get the power to raise the Kundalini others, to cure them. And all the knowledge that is within you starts pouring around.
In any time, I have seen people who have been ordinary artists, have become tremendous artist. In every line of life, everybody had prospered. All destructive habits disappear. And your attention becomes so pure and fruitful.
All these things you get it, just when you are connected with the Divine. But for that, you have to be connected.
You have to, for the time being, get out of also, the slavery of the watch. People in the West have no time for themselves. All the time, they are busy with others.
Translator: All the time?
Shri Mataji: They trying to please others. It is so artificial.
Now Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations. And it is working very well. You'll find your brothers and sisters all over the world, living in the same collective consciousness. But I must tell you, the best place which has prospered- forget about India- is Russia. We have programs always in a stadium; 16,000 to 18,000,000 people come. And they get their Realization. And they stick on it. They work it out, they grow. Why? Thanks God, they didn’t have stupid freedom. I am not for communism at all, of course! But it has failed up in there. Because it was not real communism. Democracy has also failed, it is demonocracy. But people do not want to accept it.

There is a central path and where there is stateless state, stateless state: without any state. Everyone is connected collectively. They are recognized. they are transformed with power.
For example, now supposing, I have all the powers and I am a great capitalist. But I'm also a great communist, because I can’t do without spreading it. I have shared this long before. I'm now over 70 years of age and I am travelling every day and come back. It has to whittle out.

So, why don’t have it? It’s your own. It's within yourself. Now, the only thing is, I cannot force it on you.
You are completely free to choose. Absolut freedom. Of course, I assure you, that have full confidence that all of you will get your Realisation. Just you have to have full desire to have your Self-realisation, and the people also.

I now will have questions, one or two. I would request you to write down your questions. And we will have follow-up here, where people will answer. But all these questions and answers are only mental activities. Better get to the point, why waste your time?
There's one thing I must tell you which is very important, that today this Sahaja Yoga is collective. It is not for one person. Supposing you say, "I am doing it at home". It won’t work out. If a nail is cut off from the body, it doesn't grow. You have to go to the collective.

Now the door is opened to all kinds of people and sometimes you might find some crazy people also getting in. It doesn’t matter. They’ll all improve. The solution is the compassion. With compassion, everything can work out.
We have certified lunatics who got it.
[To the translator]: Lunatics. What to say for lunatics? You call lunatics, mad people. [Laughter]
All right. So, it's something so tremendous, so fantastic. But you have to have faith.
[To the translator]: It's very tremendous and fantastic. But you have to have faith in yourself, that's very important.

So now, before we start and forgive me, I’ve a request that those who don’t want to have their Self-realization or their ascend, should to leave the hall. It will take about 15 minutes at the most. Even if you keep the watch.
[Laughter]
So, those who want to go, please go now.

In Russia, not one person would leave the hall. Not one. Very simple.
[Unclear conversation aside]
They can’t be mental because this is the machinery of God. They can do a lot.

All right. So, there are three conditions for that. The first one is that you should not feel guilty for anything. This comes from Catholic church. If you have done any mistakes, all right, face it. Why keep it here, in this centre here?
But if you put the guilt here, what happens that this center goes off. I mean with that you might develop angina. You might develop spondylisema. Also, you are getting lethargic.

So why have a guilt?
Now. I know Germans also have also the guilt of the last war. You are not the ones who did anything. Why are you guilty? You didn’t do anything wrong. Why do you feel guilty? If you have to feel guilty about anything, better feel guilty about Swiss banks.
[Laughter]

3 out 4 of Indian land is supposed to be of poor people. You have to know the statistics. If you come to know, they are openly doing plunder [unsure]. And they are carrying a white cloth with the all the blood around of the developing countries.

But they are there and Masonic people are joining them and the Catholic church has all the blessing on them.
[To the translator]: All the Masonic are there. Masonic. Yes.
It is very surprising how things are working out under your eyes. You don't see that the people are suffering. We can only see Bosnia people. But the Swiss Bank has created economic Bosnia all over the world. And you can see that [unsure]. They give loans to the World Bank.
[To the translator]: They give loans to the World Bank.
And the World Bank gives loans to us, the poor countries. And the money is transferred from these pour countries though Vatican to Swiss banks.
[To the translator]: Recycled, taken away though the Vatican.
And again we are in debts. We are in debts and they are rich.
In these modern times, such horrible things are happening. This is one thing that we accept. We accept it. It’s very wrong.

So many people are dying of starvation, but nobody can do anything about it.
Thieves, criminals. [unclear]
We are the thieves, all right. We are thieves, we are criminals. What do we do? We are not burglars? We are!

They are very hard. They don’t feel guilty. Those who should feel guilty are different people who never feel guilt. They have no shame about it. So, you’d better not feel guilty. You are seekers of truth, you’re great people.

Now the second thing is that you have to forgive everyone. Even not to think of anyone. You won’t forgive "in any case": see, logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you torture yourself and you play into wrong hands.
So, you have to forgive in general. Don't think about them. They are [unclear] Because this centre has you see is where they cross each other, at optic chiasma in the brain.
So, we have to be very careful that it’s better to forgive all of them and get to the summit.

And the third condition is that you have to be absolutely pleasantly placed toward yourself. You have to be absolutely confident that you’ll get your Realisation. There should be no diffidence about it. If you have been to some wrong guru or wrong things, it doesn’t matter. Everything can be corrected.

[Realisation process starts]
