I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is. Truth cannot be conceptualized. By thinking you cannot reach truth. By reading you cannot reach truth. By any physical, mental, emotional efforts you cannot reach truth. Unfortunately, you cannot also know the truth at this human awareness. Something is missing in our lives, in our human awareness that we do not know the absolute truth. That is why we have different opinions, different ideas and ideology. If truth is one then there should be no quarrel about it. So that missing point is that, we still have to evolve more. That we have to become the Spirit.

Whatever I am telling you today here should be treated as hypothesis with an opinion mind of a scientist. You need not believe [UNCLEAR]. But if you experience it, and if you find it that it is true as honest people the seekers of truth, you have to accept it. The fundamental truth about you is, that you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego, not these conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit. You are all, all of you are pure Spirits. All of you have got the divinity within yourself. Only you have to touch that divinity.

The second truth is that there is a All-pervading power. Power of Divine love. You see the beautiful flowers here, we don’t even think that they have come out of small little seeds, different seeds. We take them for granted. Look at ourselves. we have evolved from ameba and this state, we take it for granted. And look at this eye, what a beautiful camera it is, micro camera. Which energy has done this? All this living work has been done by this all-pervading power of divine love. It is subtle. That’s why you have to become a subtler being.

Human organizations and enterprises have grown big like a tree. Human civilization like a big tree has grown but waiting for some sort of a shock. And there are so many problems for which we have no solutions. We have the knowledge of the tree, but we have the no knowledge of the roots. This is the knowledge of the roots, and you have to become the subtler being to enter penetrate into the roots. Like this instrument is made here and if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. And as long as we are not connected to the mains, our life also has no meaning.

He has already explained to you about this instrument that resides within us. In the Bible it is described as the tree of life. Also, I will appear before you like tones of flames in old testament. These are the centers. Its not only in the Bible, but in all the scriptures it is written that you have to be re-born. That doesn’t mean that you just certify yourself as re-born person. It is a higher subtler state of the Spirit that you have to achieve. It tis the actualization of your baptism. Actualization. Not just somebody says you are baptized. No not that way. It’s the becoming of you. As a result of the awakening of the kundalini, all our centers get nourished and enlightened.

St-Thomas who went to India has written in his treaties which he had put them in Egypt about what’s the reality? And that book is now ready as called as the St. Thomas’s gospel after forty-eight years of research. Which talks of this happening and also, he talks of the centers. In all other scriptures, Indian scriptures also it is mentioned in a very elaborate manner that there this the power of Kundalini in the sacrum bone. So, the Greeks knew about this Kundalini. She is your individual mother. And she knows all about your problems. But as your mother took all the pains of you on herself while giving you your second birth, she does all the job very beautifully. Every human being has a right to get this union - this Yoga with the Divine power. But I do not know many are really destined for it in this lifetime.

It's very surprising that people do not understand that it’s a living process and you cannot pay for it. They run after false things. Because they think they can purchase false gurus or false religions. God doesn’t understand money. Look at this Mother Earth. She gives us so many things. How much do we pay her? She doesn’t understand money or banking. You can pay for the hall, you can pay for the travel, but you cannot pay for something that is living process. And it has to be very much effortless. Because it is so vital.

So, as a result of this awakening, the first state you receive when the Kundalini cross this center is what we call as thoughtless awareness. We are eighter thinking of the future or of the past. But we are not in the present. The present we cannot achieve. Present is silent. By kundalini wakening you come to that state of silence within. And when that silence is established, the growth of Divinity starts. The second state you achieve is called as the Nirvikalpa samadhi which is meaning the doubtless awareness. At that state you can awaken the Kundalini of others, you can cure others, you can feel others and you can feel yourself. So, a new dimension in awareness is awaken on our central nervous system of collective consciousness. And this collective consciousness is the one makes you understand the centers of others people on your fingertips.

In the Quran it is written that at the time of resurrection, your hands will speak. And that they will give witness against you. Means they will tell you what’s wrong with you. That means you will have self-knowledge. This is the resurrection time. This is the last judgement. Not after death. Is a wrong idea. Because Christ has said ‘I will send you the Holy Ghost, who will council you, who will revive you, who will comfort you’. How this is going to happen to dead body? How can we talk to the dead body than council? There are many wrong conceptions which have come through wrong ideas. Also believing in one book and only in one incarnation, it has created a kind of a very subtle fundamentalism. If you ask a Muslim, he will think he is a chosen one, and Christians and Jews are the worst. You ask the Jews; they will say these Christians and these Muslims are the worst. Same with the Christians, they think Muslims and Jews are the worst. But they are just the same, there is no difference. Because anyone of them can commit any sin.

But after Self-realization, you come saints, you don’t commit sins, you become collective, you don’t hate anyone, no question of feeling and you await in the realm of kingdom of God. Whatever I am saying might sound to you very fantastic. Because we have no faith in ourselves, and we feel very guilty all the time for nothing at all. Say if we take a television set in a remote village of India and tell them that all the pictures will be happening into here, they think what is this box, how can it be? But as soon as you put to the mains, they are amazed at this box. In the same way when we are put to the mains, we are really surprised, amazed the way we are glorious. After all, we are human beings, we are not Gods. If we are made mistakes, what does it matter? This All-pervading Power is the ocean of forgiveness. So why should we feel guilty? Why should you suffer? If God almighty is our Father, which father would like his children to suffer? And if so, Christ has already suffered for us, we are not going to suffer more than Him.

So, after Sahaja Yoga, you will be surprised to know that all these incarnations, these prophets and real saints are all related to each other. Then you develop a very collective feeling for all of them. And automatically you become righteous. There is nothing to be told to you that don’t do this, don’t do that. In the light of Spirit, you see the Truth, the reality, the beauty and the love.

Tomorrow, I will tell you about the nature of the Spirit. Today I would like you to ask me questions. I have not come here to take anything from you. I have just come here to give you the key of your Joy. So please ask relevant questions. Now I know all the answers to all the questions also very well. And its just a mental acrobat. That doesn’t guarantee your Realization. It's an actualization, it has to work out.

But you must ask me questions because later on you will just at the time of entering into new awareness, your mind might just jump up to say ask these questions. Moreover, you are free to ask, there is no compulsion on you. Because it cannot be forced. It has to happen in the glory of your freedom. Because you have to be absolutely free later on.

Yes, please standup.

Question: If somebody has reached the highest, let us say [UNCLEAR siddhi] chakra, is he ... determined his whole life?

Shri Mataji: Siddhi chakra? Is what?

Yogini: When he has reached the highest thing, would he then decide about his life?

Shri Mataji: Of course really, of course, of course you become your own master.

Yogini: Shri Mataji, he wanted to know if [UNCLEAR it/he] then take away his life? He can kill himself, that he is free to decide about his life whether he wants to live or not.

Shri Mataji: Of course, he can, he can, of course he has to.

[Yogi comes to Shri Mataji and says something]

Shri Mataji: To kill yourself? Why? You see, this is not happening for your sake only, it is happening for the rest of the world. This is for the emancipation for the whole world. And you have to give this to others. You don’t take it just for yourself. Its selfish. You have to give it to others and share it with others.

I mean I didn’t understand. I didn’t understand first of all, sorry. You will never kill yourself. You won’t do it because you will be filled with such compassion. You will know the value of your precious life. And importance of these times. These are very important times. May God bless you.

I dint understand what you said – [Shri Mataji addressing to the translator]

Translator: Sorry

I thought of he wants to get out of .,

Yes madam.

Question: Shri Mataji, what is the difference between self-realization and enlightenment?

Shri Mataji: Both are just the same. You see the light enlightens you. Self-realization means the Spirit coming into your attention.

Question: [UNCLEAR Which aspect has got father and which aspect has mother?]

Shri Mataji: The God the Father is the one who is watching the work of God the Mother. God the Father is the witness of God the Mother. His aspect is more to be angry with people who try to trouble the Mother. You will know about them later on very well.

Question: What is the meaning when the chakra on the fontanelle bone is over UNCLEAR [heated] with burning sensation?

Shri Mataji: That means there is something wrong in the body, which is to be corrected. [UNCLEAR But/that] can be. Could believe her. Or you have been to a wrong master.

Question: Shri Mataji, he has lots of freedom. And he has the idea about [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: I am talking about the freedom which comes through wisdom. Divine wisdom. That means that your Spirit shines in your attention, in your being, in that light you see everything clearly. Now see there is darkness, you don’t know how you are related to others, you start walking, you will trample over people, you will destroy people, trouble them.

Alright, any other question?

Question: Shri Mataji, the question is, can Sex is the achievement of self-realization?

Shri Mataji: It does not in any way, sex does not play any part when the Kundalini raises. You have to be married in a sained way and live in a sained way. The last center that you see here, the red one-the first center is the center of your innocence. And it looks after your pelvic plexus. Means, the one which looks after also your sex activity. So, this center is not to be pierced through by Kundalini as you can see clearly. But you would be happy to know, whatever you might have done to this innocence of yours, it can never be destroyed. It can only get covered with some clouds, because you have gone into perversions and wrong type of life. But it is all the time there. It’s eternal. So, you should not have any worry on that point. As Christ has said, you have to become like children to enter into kingdom of God. So that’s what happens when the Kundalini starts raising, this center puts all its energy for the raising and doesn’t pay any attention to any other activity. All your activity is of excretion stops. Christ has said ‘thou shall not have adulterous eyes’, what a subtle way of saying that your eye should have no lust and greed in them. But if you see the fundamentals of western life is that to see and to be seen. Because perhaps may be we never worship Christ but we worship this horrible fellow Freud and kick Christ. But when the Kundalini raises, your eyes get back your innocence absolutely. All the lust and greed is finished from the eyes. And when they develop properly, even a glance of such person can bring peace, joy and joy. All this madness of wasting our attention and making our head full of tensions just disappears. And such a joyful life, such a pure life. In sahaja yoga we have many marriages and I have seen they get children who are born realized. Great children they get. Because there are so many who are waiting to be born on this Earth. I am sorry to hear in Germany and in most of the western countries the population growth is on the minus. But once you get your realization, you will be surprised, you will get saintly children. Beautiful children, something very special, and extremely wise. The other day when sahaja yogi told me that, my daughter was telling me that ‘Daddy you are again getting complicated’. They talk in such a wise manner that you are amazed at them. If you have to change the world and if you have to solve our problems, we have to transform human beings.

Any other question?

Question: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Yeah, very good question. See this is the human beings were given all the freedom then Adam and Eve tried to get out of it and the whole evolution system had to be setup. So, there have been different periods called as Yugas. And these modern times are described as the Kaliyuga are the worst times. Where the people will be completely under illusions, they will lose their wisdom and follow people who are false, and they will try to destroy themselves. They will be in such a confusion, in Sanskrit it is Branthi, such a confusion that they will not what is right and what is wrong. And they suffer with diseases which are incurable, most of them rot by their mistakes. In those days only there will be great seekers of Truth will be born. And those seekers who have been seeking in the Himalayas and on the hills and dales will be like householders. Ordinary people. Special category of people. Willium Blake has called them ‘Men of God, they will see Truth and they will give Truth to others’. So, this is the times specially where is there is resurrection because people are seeking. They are honestly seeking the Truth. Sometimes they are misled alright doesn’t matter, makes no difference.

Question: She wants to ask again so she can understand clearly, what is the connection between marriage and love. Because one side marriage [UNCLEAR] and the other side love can also [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: In sahaja yoga marriages we hardly have divorces. Divorce is allowed but its hardly we have divorces in sahaja yoga marriages. The basis for divorce is the difference between the levels of people. And understanding the relationship between the two. Love seems to be a very great misnomer. It’s an infatuation, some sort of infatuation. Temporary. Because certain ideas are built-in that you must fall in love. We really fall not doubt. But we have a choice always to find out a proper man whom we can like. Sometimes people marry after twenty years of living together. And then they divorce immediately and say sort of a freight built in the minds that marriage means some sort of a domination, some sort of a competition. Which is not. Its beautiful companionship. But only with the light of the Spirit, you can discover the beauty of another person. So this is what happens to you when you are an enlighten person. We should not reduce ourselves to sex point as Freud has told us. We are not animals, we are human beings and we have to become the Spirits. So, we do not become beastly people. Fighting, quarreling, criticizing. No, we become beautiful supports of each other. Enjoying each other. We have people about two thousand people have come to a seminar in India, in a village, we can say near the sea shore. From fifty-five countries. They never quarreled, fight nothing.  Of course, they do little bit of leg pulling is alright. very friendly. Isn’t it something great? When you see all these vilegans everywhere. When ever human beings now a days joined together they just fight. conference means fight. Any big things United Nations means fight. Anything. Or competition or jealousies, hatred. All the beauty and divinity of a human being is lost. Also, there is no dignity, no self-respect. So, you do not respect others either. All these qualities are just there within you. All of them are there. They are not lost. You get completely cured of your disease, you get completely cured of mental problems, stress and all these nonsense. And is your own power.

Alright?

Now should we have realization?

One more? Alright.

Shri Mataji: What he said?

Question: [UNCLEAR] compassion, affection how is that [UNCELAR] self-realization [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: No no. When you get your self-realization, your attention becomes concentrated. Your brain becomes enlightened. Many people have got. Many people have got. They are doctorates in science after coming to sahaja yoga. Many children who were dull in school are getting first positions. Because you are no more confused. So, you really become perfect in side and out.

Question: He is relating to the terminology Shri Mataji and the question is why the [UNCLEAR] sahaja yoga with Kundalini yoga ...

Shri Mataji: Sahaja saha means born with you. Born with you is this right to get your union with the divine. So sahaja yoga is the wider terminology which encompasses all the yoga systems, all the history of spirituality, also it encompasses all the problems of the world. It is not only Kundalini yoga, its not an individual happening. you cannot, after getting your Kundalini yog, get out of your responsibility to the whole world. Its like a nail. If you cut it out, it doesn’t grow. It’s not an individual yoga. Like the Buddhists, they will sit individually meditate and all. No. Because in the olden days when it was individual, they have to go through terrible penances, terrible penances for their cleansing or their ascent. So, they had to be individually done. But sahaja yoga has a solution that in collective you live. You meditate in collective. The method I found out is that you can get your self-realization a mass. So your cleansing and all that automatically takes place automatically as soon as you become collective. You don’t have to go to Himalayas for that. [Video discontinued]

And then you come here fed-up with all that.

Question: [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Just the same as Christ [UNCLEAR], just the same. In every scripture it will describe the same way. In sahaja yoga you find all the scriptures saying the same thing between the lines. All the incarnations building you up for this today. You will know everything as to whatever I have said God almighty is called as Sada Shiva. They had to talk of also abstract about this all-pervading power. Because people when you talk of God they start thinking their Gods. So they started talking about the Nirakara about the formless. First, they talked about the flowers. So, to get the honey, they started worshiping the flowers - the forms. They said ‘no no no, let us talk about the honey otherwise they worship the flowers’, so they talked about the formless. So, it was talk talk and talk. Whether about the form or formless you have to become the bee to get the honey. By talks you do not become. All these questions will be very easily understood if you get your light.

Question: UNCLEAR[ why this God almighty come out oneness provide the..]

Shri Mataji: You can’t question God. It is his whim. You cannot question God why he did it. You see, there is a reason for everything that he does, there is a reason. Its all a very well-planned thing. He is more efficient than Germans. He knows how to organize this creation. He knows. And that’s why he had to make himself separate from his energy of love. And in the office we have one manager and other is the energy that works the management.

Question: She says but why we have all the way to come back to where we already were.

Shri Mataji: I told you. It started with Adam and Eve. They didn’t accept these commandments. It’s a headache more for God than for you. If they were told if they behaved alright, there would have been no problem, but they did not. Then he understood that these human beings need their own freedom to be used. Because they were given freedom this was the mistake that they were given freedom because animals don’t have freedom. Only human beings have the freedom. And we have freedom to go to the kingdom of God or to go to hell. We have freedom. If you want to do, you can do it.

Question: She says one level Shri Mataji would you occupy in her life, UNCLEAR[] of practice sahaja yoga?

Shri Mataji: I mean its so funny question. There is nothing like that. I am not going to occupy your life. I am like an ocean. You cannot put it in a small little cup. Can you? I am sorry.

Question: She is asking Shri Mataji, whether this ocean has any special wish?

Shri Mataji: I want you all to get your realization.

But you know I am desireless and you have to have the pure desire to get realization. You should have. Because Kundalini is the power of pure desire. All other desires are impure that’s why we are not satisfied.

So, I think now we should start.

It should be the last, Alright?

No no its alright, you can ask now.

Shri Mataji: What she said?

Question: Her question is [UNCLEAR ....]

Shri Mataji: It doesn’t, its imaginary. There are many imaginary things we believe in. if your pain is physical, it will disappear, and if your guilt is there, it will disappear too. You do not know how dangerous it is to be guilty.

Please be seated [Shri Mataji addressing to the person who asked the question]

When you feel guilty, this center here, left side catches very badly. As a result you develop spondylitis-Anjaina. And most of the lethargic organs on the left side. Moreover, if you feel guilty the Kundalini cannot raise, because the chakra is completely closed. Whatever you think is not always reality. But it is very absurd also. Now Germans should have no guilt at all about war. Because your forefathers did it, its not you. Now your forefathers are born in Iran. They are not here. Why are you feeling guilty for them? You will lose your chance of realization out of this artificial idea. On the contrary I must tell you in my experience. I found German sahaja yogis are the gentlest people you could think of. Absolutely very gentle. That gestapos are born there somewhere. Waring, fighting. Have no guilt.

Question: Who can store these locations [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: There are deities on every center. They dissolve it. When the Kundalini raises, she awakens those deities, and they dissolve all these catches. But when will do this meditation then you will have to say that you want it. I will tell you how to do it yourself, you can support it.

Alright, let’s have it now.

It will take about fifteen minutes.

But as I said it cannot be forced. So, those who do not want to have it can leave the hall. All others must get seated. Beter be seated. there are seats here. Come along. Be comfortable.

Now, alright, there are two forces left and right. Left is the power of our desire. So, the left one is the power of desire and the right one is the power of action. So, we put our left foot on one side and right on another side when we are sitting on the chair. On the ground you are alright.

[Shri Mataji addressing to a lady]

I think she should on the chair otherwise she may not get her realization. Poor thing. Yes better. She is not alright, poor thing. Yes, it’s better. Yeah. You can’t put [UNCLEAR]. you have to put them out. Just for fifteen minutes. Just for fifteen minutes. Put it on the sides. Poor thing she is not well at all. Its alright. alright. You see this. Alright.

Now, you have to be comfortable. Absolutely. You don’t have to go to Himalayas or anything very comfortably. Put both your feet apart from each other, take out your shoes. Because you have to take help from the Mother Earth. Please take out your shoes all of you. Good. He is the real seeker I tell you. What about him? He can’t takeout? This gentleman [UNCLEAR], behind you, he can’t take it out?

You will have to help him, I think. Just help him, you will have to help him I think. Just help him – [Shri Mataji addressing to yogi to help the seeker]

Alright.

You have to put our right-hand for action and left-hand on your lap in a very comfortable manner. Now try to follow properly. Now, your right-hand is going to nourish all your centers. On the left-hand side

Come forward – [Shri Mataji asking yogi to come forward]

Now he will show you how to do. Just you see him. It’s very simple. But before that I have to tell you there are three conditions. The first one is that you have to have complete self confidence about yourself. That you will get your self-realization. All of you. The second one is that you forget the past and be in the presence and don’t feel guilty at all. Third one is very simple that you have to forgive everyone in general. Its very simple but people think its very difficult. Logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. Nothing you do. But if you do not forgive then you play into the wrong hands and torture yourself for nothing at all. You are torturing  not the people who want to torture you. They are very happily placed. But you are torturing yourself by not forgiving. So just forgive everyone without thinking about them individually. And forgive them in general. Just say I forgive all of them, you will feel so much lighter. You have to do that because this center of optic charism has closed like this. Its very very constricted. Agnya. And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open and you won’t get your realization properly and even if you get it you may not get cool breeze, you will get a little hot breeze. But if you forgive it opens up like this very beautifully. These are the only three conditions.

Now, please don’t feel guilty. Actually, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Because you are a human being, the epitome of evolution and there is a little break through needed that’s all.

So now please put your left-hand like this. You need not bend not push back yourself, sit just straight that’s all. Comfortably. You put your left-hand on your lap comfortably. It will work out. And put now your right-hand on your heart. In the heart is the reflection of the Spirit that is the God Almighty. So, if you become the Spirit, then you become your own master. So put your right-hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. This is the center of your mastery. I have already told you that I respect your freedom, and this is the center down below in the left-hand side in the lower portion of your abdomen where there is the pure knowledge. But I cannot force it on you. Now raise your right-hand again, take your right-hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge. With which we workout all the Divine work. Now raise your right-hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, then on your heart, then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. From the front you have to take your hand and turn your head to your right. This center you catch when you feel guilty, I told you about it. Then take your hand on top of your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone. Now take back your hand on the backside of your head and push back your head and here you have to without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes for your satisfaction. You have to ask forgiveness from the Divine power. Now, stretch your palm fully. And take the center of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area and bend your head and push back your fingers and press it back nicely the scalp. Put down your head press back your fingers, and now move your scalp clockwise seven times with a pressure slowly.

Now, that’s all we have to do. If you have got anything tight on your waist or in your neck you can loosen it a little bit. And you have to take out your spectacles because you have to close your eyes and don’t open them till I tell you.

Now, please put your left-hand towards me like this, and right-hand on your heart and please close your eyes. Here you have to ask me a very fundamental question. You have to ask three times; you may call me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever you like. Three times you ask me a question in your heart ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’. Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master. So, take down right-hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask another question three times ‘Mother, am I my own master?’. Alright. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So please takedown your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to say in your freedom ‘Mother, please give me pure knowledge’. Say it six times because this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts raising. So now we have to nourish our upper centers with our self-confidence. So please take your right-hand on to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it. Here you have to say with full confidence ten times ‘Mother, I am my own master’. I told you the fundamental truth about you is that, you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego, not these conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right-hand on to your heart and say it with full confidence. ‘Mother, I am the Spirit’. This Divine power is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of absolute knowledge. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistake you might commit it can be easily dissolved by the power of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and take your right-hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Take it from the front. Here with full confidence, please say sixteen times. ‘Mother I am not guilty at all’. Please say it sixteen times. I have already told you, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you do not do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. So now raise your right-hand on the top of your forehead across and bend your head. Here, you have to say with full confidence, not how many times, ‘Mother, I forgive everyone’ in general. Now please take your hand back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, ‘O Divine power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me’. Now, please stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers as far as possible, push them back so that there’s a good pressure. Push back your fingers. Now bend your head. You all should push back your fingers. Please push back and put down your head. Please put down your head. Here again I cannot cross your freedom, I cannot force self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So, please move your scalp seven times clockwise and say seven times ‘Mother, please give me my self-realization’.

Now, please take down your hands. Put your hands like this towards me and watch me without thinking. You can do it. Now put down your head, put the right-hand towards me and see for yourself if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head. Don’t put your hand  on the head but away from it and see for yourself by moving your left-hand. Now, put the left-hand towards me. And again put down your head, put down your head and see for yourself again with the right-hand. Now take your right-hand towards me. And again please see with your left-hand. Some people get it far away. Now, take your both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. And ask anyone of these questions three times: ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God almighty? Mother, is this the parama chaitanya?’ ask any one of these questions three times.

Now put down your hands. Put your hands like this. You feel very relaxed. Watch me without thoughts. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their hands, fingers or out of their fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands. [UNCELAR]

May God bless you.

Your saintly life has started. I bow to you all. Tomorrow will have again, those who did not feel, will feel. And those who have felt, will fee better. Also, I will meet all of you individually tomorrow. I hope there will be less questions to [UNCLEAR harrow] and you will save sometime on that.

Thank you very much.

[Shri Mataji addressing to a yogi] -

And you have to tell them as it is a collective happening, you have to come, and everything will be told to you without any charges.

Beauatiful people.

Also tell your friends to come.
