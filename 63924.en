It was really such a unique day and such a performance. Words really are not sufficient to describe our joy but as you are seeing today about [unclear: alunda dihardy] I saw all of you becoming [aninda vehardis] absolutely. Now we have before us such a great artist. His name is, you know [unclear] but have you seen the word [Alidia]? Perhaps you do not know that we worship Ali and Fatima ji in a puja. There's a regular puja for them because to us they are Brahamadeva itself and that's why you will find among these Shia people who have got such a talent of expression. In the Quran I am sorry to say that Mohammed Sahib was tortured so much and also later on as you know Hassan and Hussein were killed in Karbella. They had no time to talk about the universal nature. But such a great book is this Quran. They have written now some sort of a commentary on that and it's obvious that he was the incarnation of the primordial master though he was so humble he was so much worried that he should not be called as divine because people will again start doing all kinds of ritualism. But now you can see especially on tableau. Left side of a muslim man is always very strong. I knew that. This is a blessing of that great incarnation of Ali. Brahamadeva only incarate only twice. One was Ali who was not understood even by the followers from Mohammed Sahib. It's always so. But we know who he is and we worship him [Marathi] and by taking his name we have cured many diabetic patients. But before that we have to be connected with that divine power.

Now I see two very great saints sitting next to [unclear: sahib]. They are really saints, born realised. You can see that. Otherwise at this young age they cannot be so deft. They cannot. Such understanding, rapport and deftness from last life. Might be they might have been with [unclear] I don't know but really they are prodigies. And such prodigies are now born to great artists is also the blessing of the Divine I think. You choose your parents no doubt. But they should be born to such great artist itself, it shows their own choice, and they are saints. I am happy they have come to Maharashtra because you know Maharashtrans are absolutely drowned into music.

We had saints and saints and [unclear] saints, all kinds of things but we had no saints yet who had played sarod. So such beautiful things you see nowadays happening in this world that these great people are taking birth in the families of great artists because they know the value of this art. Of this great classical music art. You also now realise. I know because now you are realised souls and you understand it and you don't like cheap type music. But see the dignity, the style and everything. Of course I always felt [unclear:] was like my son. Always. This [inclear: sahib] is a big man I know but I always felt that kind of a feeling for him because he has that humility. With all that art, with all that creativity he is so humble. He is not at all conscious of his own achievements at all. I give really a great credit to him and to his two children also. You know how difficult it is for Me to be your Mother when you are a guru. It is a very difficult situation. In the same way a father being your guru is very difficult, especially for such a music which requires complete [tapas charia], complete dedication and complete respect of your guru. When he is your father it's very difficult. I don't know how things are being managed by these children and how they have imbibed these things and such respect for their father. Because they see what art he has. I feel a great vision is before Me of this great music and through music you have seen the chaitanya, the vibrations are carried everywhere. So how far can you think of the dimensions in which all this beautiful divine music will spread. I invite also [unclear] to My house in Cabella.

I am not such a rich person. I won't be able to really give you support you the way I would like to support all the artists. By all the audience, I will say they have got the blessings of the Saraswati but you must look after their laksmi side. But I am not so well off I should say. Whatever is possible I will try to look after. It's what meditative mood he was singing, just singing and he put you into meditation. Of course [unclear] is a very simple beautiful raga. The way he played and his children. I must say this I've never heard such [unclear] before. Never heard. I must confess. I am the oldest woman here. I have heard all kinds of people all My life but never such good [unclear] I have heard. It's such a [unclear] you see because it was not [unclear] but three persons trigunamika was playing. With such poise, such dignity, such beauty. You all have enjoyed. I don’t know how to thank [unclear: Sahib] coming himself and bringing his children to give us this joy. Also the rag by [unclear] which you all appreciate very much and enjoy. But I think you really got lost with him completely. It was very meditative, very, very meditative and I think all your thoughts had stopped completely. You had reached a state of nirvichara. I also was in another world of music. Then the comaj and the bhajan which was the favourite song of Mahatma Gandhi. Unfortunately Mahatma Gandhi never knew how to play any sarod nor he knew how to sing.

You know I had been with him as a child for years together. But such an interesting person he was that he could immediately make out if somebody was making any mistakes in the tala or in the swarod. Surprisingly he never knew Indian music but he had that spirit within him. Immediately he used to say this is wrong and he respected music very much. Very much he respected music and in his music he – you know that very well that his personality was selected by Me quite a lot, especially the first prayer service. He used to ask though he was a realised soul he used people who were of very mundane type, very ordinary materialistic people for the freedom of this country. I don't know he was like some sort of a [unclear] as they say of something that just becomes whole. He was that kind of a leader who gave us such a great idea of sarvadharma, samalatua. But more than that is in Sahaja Yoga.

We do not feel that all dharma's are equal but we worship all of them. All of them because they were all great people born on the tree of life as beautiful flowers. Now you pluck them and the dead flowers will fight. But they work for only divinity and spirituality and nothing else. How could they work for anything else? But we have as human beings always tried make a mess of everything. But Sahaja Yoga – all the Sahaja Yogis worship them and this is the difference. Just feeling the same way about say Hindu, Muslims and all that is different from to worship Mohammed Sahib as well as Shri Rama or Shri Krishna. It's much deeper because we know they are all one. They said the same thing. They never wanted to create problems like this and in the music you find you forget all your differences, your so-called brands, your countries, nations. Now you won't believe there are 55 nations sitting before you. Fifty five nations. We have Muslims from Iran, from Algeria, from Tunisia. Also there are so many of them who have now absolutely achieved a state of Sufi s. They respect and worship all the great saints. In India also we have a very big movement I should say of the great saints [unclear]. You know that [unclear] was be another realised soul [unclear: they sing] in the qawalis. They have never – how could Mohammed Sahib say that you should not have music how is it possible? How can it be? It's absolute wrong, impossible there’s not much of a difference between [Raishmajana] and the sufi's. They are just the same. How could they say such a thing and how could Christ say that you can have wine? All this is some sort of a manipulation I think. Is impossible. Music is divine. Of course cheap type music would be very different. But without music how are you going to worship God? How are you going to feel it? Only at the time of meditation you can be silent. But this music that you have heard today has shown you how we were all tied in one [unclear], into one beautiful feeling of one-ness.

So many countries are here. They have never learnt any classical music. They don't know any ragas. They don't know any talas. Nothing. But the way they appreciate you'll be surprised, it's only because now they have become the spirit. [Hindy]

You are not supposed to wear topis in front of such great artists

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji it's very difficult to use words after music and it's very difficult to use words after you have spoken. We heard many performances of great musicians but as soon as these great artists came in we felt that we would be in your [durbah] at home with someone who would play with the strings of our heart and that's what happened. We were I don't know where Shri Mataji. Certainly in joy. We were feeling the closeness. We were proud of him as if we were his children or his family. This is strange to have such a feeling for someone one has never met. We all see so very much and enjoy the joyful and buoyant performance of the tala player who was sending notes of merriness and joy and we were very impressed by the children of the great artist.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis of all the world I would like also to thank [Hajesha] who has provided us the opportunity to see you so pleased Shri Mataji, because this is what we have enjoyed. In so many words, thank you very much for an exceptional evening. Thank you.

Sahaja Yogini: Can I just say a few words. On behalf of Mataji when [unclear] rang us up she wrote a formal letter and since I deal with correspondence I just said in a normal way I started writing

since Mataji said about Lakshmi and Saraswati. I have to mention this to you. I wrote that Lakshmi part of it. Then she wrote saying Mataji is going to be here and this is a [unclear]. I said you asked me that's why I wrote. I didn't say you have to do anything for us. We just need your blessings and I humbly requested to [unclear] and told her I'll be very happy. We both will be very honoured and blessed if Mataji bless the children. So this is the first time we plan to bring mainly because of You Mataji - the children and fourteen years ago when I was with [unclear] and marrying an artist who was love by all was a very difficult job for me to face the world and I did not know [Malinga] musicians [unclear]. And I was very disturbed when I went to Mataji and I literally started crying. She took me to Her room and sat with Her. She blessed me. Every since then I don't think I have ever looked back with Her blessings. Art and culture I think without the love of people the listeners and of course the blessings of people like Mataji and God it cannot be music. So I think with all Your blessings Mataji may it flourish more and more.

Shr Mataji: May God bless you.

Shri Mataji: This is what happened when Christ vibrated the water it tasted like the grape juice. But they said it was wine. But this is the word used in Hebrew – wine for a grape juice. How can you make wine in one minute instantaneously? It has to ferment. It has to rot. It has to become absolutely rotten, otherwise it's not wine. So this is such a misunderstanding. That's why Mohammed Sahib had to say again and again.
