Birthday Felicitations. Nirmal Dham, Delhi (India), 20 March 2003.

Today everybody is trying to talk to you in English language because I think they feel majority of you are speaking English.
I wish I could tell you something new about life. Life goes on moving. Whether you are eighty or ninety makes no difference. Only thing is how much you have used the light that you have got it in Sahaja Yoga.

All of you are now enlightened in Sahaja Yoga. All of your kundalinis are up and I think you know most of it. But despite that, it’s important how much time you devote for the emancipation of human beings, for helping them to come on. Instead of criticizing them, instead of condemning them, your duty is to put them on higher pedestal, so they respect themselves and respect their Self Realization.

It’s very important because I met many Sahaja Yogis to begin with who were very much critical of their colleagues and all other things, but since they have got Realization, they think it’s a matter of duty for them, that is, that they should attend to the emancipation of human beings. Then there won’t be any problem of any kind – no political problem, no economic problem, nothing of the kind.

All these problems are created by mind, which is not yet fully developed, I should say. And once it is developed, you are not bothered. You are bothered about others. You are bothered about emancipation of others. It’s automatic. I don’t have to say that. But you have seen in your lives how your attitudes have changed towards life and that is what is more important than anything else.

Some of you are already successful people in politics, in business and this and that. But you are not satisfied till you give Realization to people, till you make them perfect like yourself.
[I’m] so very happy to see so many people being helped by Sahaja Yoga. I never expected that in My lifetime only I’ll see this, but [it] just worked out – worked out so wonderfully. I’m really amazed how things grew so fast and how it has grown into so many countries, into the so many people’s heart and how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. They’re working not only in their own country, but also outside. After all, I can’t go everywhere now. But, despite that, Sahaja Yoga is spreading, which is such a great thing for Me – so satisfying. You have no idea when I hear that Sahaja Yoga has gone to this country and gone to that country.

Practically, they say, in forty-three countries Sahaja Yoga is settled down in a very large way and, in a smaller way, maybe it is in many more. But to hear this also, I never expected that it would work that fast. It’s all thanks to you, to you Sahaja Yogis who [have] achieved this miracle. 
I’m thankful to you all, from India and abroad, those who have taken up the flag of emancipation and are moving forward, instead of criticizing, instead of degrading some people. [It’s] very easy to do that. But what about you, yourself rising above all that and making others rise also? We can change the whole world and you start understanding the problems of the world and you can get rid of them with your kundalini awakening.

Such a great thing is this kundalini, I tell you, that it makes human beings something superlative. It’s all described as sayings and this and that, but a Sahaja Yogi has a greater power and the greater power is that he can make others Sahaja Yogi[s]. He can give Realizations to others. They must use their powers and should try to change the whole world. That’s My desire. I don’t know in My lifetime I’ll achieve it or not. But you all should decide that way and I’m sure it will all work out.

May God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
