[Introduction in Hindi for 50 seconds.]

Yesterday, we discussed the existence of Kundalini, your divine mother in your being, which is born with you. Every time we take birth, it is with you. It records all that you are.

Today, we will discuss Sahaja Yoga. This is a name I have given, as people call it, but actually, it is not my name. This name has been used by many sages and many seers and even by Shri Krishna. ‘Sahaja’ is a Sanskrit word. It means, ‘saha’ is ‘with’. ‘Ja’ means born. ‘Yog’ has two meanings. ‘Yog’ means ‘union’. It is the union, or we can call it, re-union. And also, it has another meaning. ‘Yog’ means deftness. An expert with deftness in his job. It also means [unclear] as they call it. But the real meaning of ‘yoga’ is that after the re-union with the All-pervading Power, with your own awareness, you become deft in the art of religion.

This is a real religion of yoga. And there are various schools of yogas. For example, there is Patanjali Yoga, which discusses and explains how we can build up a mental and a physical side of your life. There is [unclear] Yoga and various yogas which are described by different seers and philosophers.

Now, Sahaja Yoga, is a yoga which integrates all the yogas, which covers all the knowledge of the world. It covers all the aspect of religion and all the religions and all the prophets that have been and that will be. Because Sahaja Yoga is the system employed by nature itself, by the Divine itself, by God himself, whether you call it God or anything. It is awareness I am talking about.

Whatever is living, as you have seen, lives by itself, spontaneously, grows by itself. No amount of effort can make a seed grow. You may stand on your head, you may do Patanjali Yoga, you may read [unclear] Yoga, you may read any yoga whatsoever, nothing can manifest, if it is living, without the spontaneity of awareness.

Actually, human beings do not do anything that is living. They do everything that is dead. That is, when we change the form of dead, from one to another, we say we have created matter. We have not. Matter exists; we just change the forms. Sometimes, we get a thought from within, spontaneously, and we note it down. We think we have done it. It is not so. It has come to you from somewhere, which you have just noted down. What human beings can do is to read some books and reproduce them. But if they have to produce anything original, they have to depend on the spontaneity of their awareness. The more you are aware, the more you are spontaneous.

Even Einstein, such a great scientist, in his introductory chapter, he says that, “I was trying to search out the methods to explain the relativity and the hypothesis that I was  carrying on. I was so very tired that I gave it up. And I was sitting in a garden, playing with soap bubbles”. Now this is his sentence, “Then, suddenly, from somewhere unknown, the theory of relativity dawned upon me. Method was done”. It just comes to you. You cannot achieve it. That's why, in the Bible, they call it 'revelation', it just reveals itself. That's the correct word. So, even whatever abstract you try to communicate to human beings, which is living, is not done by us. But in all ignorance, human beings believe that they are doing everything. And that is why we have tensions and problems. Once we know we are doing nothing, we are just a tool in the hands of the Divine, only thing we must surrender ourselves to the whims of the Divine, and to the play of the Divine and become a hollow personality, we will know that all the problems so far do not exist. Because our attitude changes [unclear].

Psychologists have described awareness, the later one, I should say the latest ones, have really been able to locate various points of awareness. But as all our scientists are, they are not integrated. Because when the psychologists also try to explain the awareness, they do it with their limitations of ego and super ego. For example, I want to explain about this hall and my eyes are blind. What can I explain but that there's a pillar? I can feel it and I can say there was a serpent hanging here out.

Yogis also have described about their experiences. In the same manner, the knowledge I do not think has been so complete to explain all the aspects of awareness. And half-knowledge is the most dangerous thing. That is why certain yogis like Patanjali Yogis, describe that you must do yoga. And with yoga, you can achieve good health. But they did not know what are the effects of the yoga asanas on the Kundalini and on the achievement of Self-realised state. Actually, human being is one identity. And every scientist and a seer and a psychologist are seeing them in different angles. And they have not been able to put them together. Nor have they been able to keep their vision that wise has to see that after all, the ultimate aim of a human being, is Self-realisation. All these scientists must lead to Self-realisation.

If you read my speeches that they have given on Sahaja Yoga, you will know that by putting any effort, we act on our sympathetic nervous system. I mean the exhausting system. For example, the 'petrol' is built from here, into our being when we are small children. Then our head is blocked, we become a separate identity. 'Iness' is developed, 'I', "Hama ma". 'I'. Now with this little battery that we have we are exhausting it by using our sympathetic nervous system. All the doctors know that when we work or do anything we work with our sympathetic nervous system. For example, when we want to increase the breathing, we can do that. Because it is sympathetic nervous system, we can bring into play. But supposing I ask you to reduce your breathing rate you cannot do it. Same with the heart. You can get into tension but you cannot relax. This is done by parasympathetic.

You ask the doctors what is parasympathetic, they'll say that it is an autonomous nervous system, finished! It's an autonomous nervous system they have given a name that should be satisfying for all of us. And we don't know what to do with that. But if you tell the doctors that, “Sir, it may be that somebody knows about the autonomous nervous system, would you like to have a look at it?” They’ll immediately say, “Can you prove it scientifically?” It can we proved scientifically if people are willing to sit down and listen. But the person who wants to tell about it may be just a housewife.

It is absolutely scientific that parasympathetic nervous system can be controlled by human beings themselves. The autonomous nervous system can be controlled if you know how to control the ‘auto’. And they call it “svayam’. What is this ‘svayam’, what is this ‘auto’? If we can some way or other be that auto, we might be able to control that autonomous nervous system, by which we can neutralize the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and can cure all the troubles of the sympathetic. For example, cancer is nothing but the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Through Sahaja Yoga, we have definitively cured of course, absolutely cured cancer patients. Of course, I mean, that's not my intention. That’s not. To cure people is not my intention at all. It is just a byproduct of Sahaja Yoga, just a byproduct. Because as soon as you become the controller of that ‘auto’, you become part auto [unsure]. Now here's the doctor, she will understand what I'm saying, that there are seven plexuses which are controlled by the parasympathetic and the sympathetic. By sympathetic, we are using all the power that is within us, like the petrol we are exhausting. Now, by some means, if we can open the scalp here, and put ourselves all the time filling with that petrol, we can never be exhausted. And all the problems that arise from that exhaustion will not arise. It is such a simple thing, is the simplest thing which should happen to us.

After all, we are created for some purpose. Not for running away from ourselves. We are not created to hate ourselves. We are created to know ourselves. Our Self, the Self which is nothing but completeintegration of beauty, love and knowledge. And knowledge that I care after you. What’s Self? It cannot be defined. All the knowledge of the world comes from that ocean [unclear]. All the beauty of the world manifests from that thing. All the love that we have had [unclear] are just nothing but the pure showers of that ocean.

With the sympathetic nervous system, when we start exhausting ourselves, we develop an ego and a superego. Everyone. You see, one shouldn't think that, some people say I'm egoless”. There is no question how you speak to other. Some people say, “There are very beautiful people”. That's not the point. Nobody is ugly according to my judgment. But what I am saying, that they are not aware of their beauty.The ego and superego, both exist in all of us because of our sympathetic activity, means going out. With the sympathetic activity, we go out, get ourselves involved outside and exhaust the little energy that is within ourselves.

Now Kundalini is another residual energy which is kept in reserve. It is there. It exists. If you can come sometimes, I mean I don't know what sort of arrangements we are going to have here. But I can show youthe pulsation of a Kundalini in many people. I can also show the rising of the Kundalini within you, with your naked eyes, whether you are Realized or not. That is not the question. But if you get Realization yourself, which is very easy also, because it is just like the sprouting of a seed. If you get yourself Realized, then not only that you can see the Kundalini of others, but you can feel it and control it and checkit and can enlighten the another person. Because as soon as you get Realization, through Self you know, you get the Collective Consciousness. Now people have talked, Jung, for example, has talked about Collective Consciousness. But I don't know how far he understood it, because he had no experience.

She can have a glimpse of a thing. For example, I can see Delhi from the aircraft, but I have not been in Delhi. So, the complete experience was not there. But you do get a Collective Consciousness. It’s such an event. Why I'm saying it is absolutely scientific? Because even a small child, say, about two years or three years of age, can feel the same way as an elderly person or an old man of ninety. All these three types of people, if they get Realized, they get the same experiences about another person and they’ll say the same thing about that person, means the Kundalini of others. This is what Sahaja Yoga gives.

Now to talk about the whole engineering is a headache which I have to do. And you too get a headache, I also will get a headache. Because those who do not understand should all want to tell, “All this engineering, it looks too much”. And those who understand, they do not want to know about it. But as I said yesterday, that if you want to put on the light, it's better just to tell you that, “You put on the switch and get the light there”. You don't bother your head to know what is the engineering. Because engineering is there, no doubt, there is the autonomous system which works. It is worked through the nature. But if I start explaining to you all the things that takes place, you will never ask for Self-realization. Because you are human beings, you’ll develop a headache. But it’s natural to have a headache with such boring things. A person who wants to know how a seed sprouts, if you start telling him all botany, he’ll say, “This is a bit too much”. So, for an easy thing like that, we need not go into the engineering of it.

It is a very, very simple thing, but for human beings to be simple is the most difficult thing. You are so complicated that you find it impossible to accept it. Sometimes, I wonder how human beings reach to their ends just like this. They should do everything like that [sentence unsure], the way they do everything upside down. When I say, “You don't have to do anything, it's a spontaneous road, it will work out, you just don't worry”, they don't like it, they [unclear]. But if I tell you, “You have to jump for 10 days shouting screaming” or if I tell you, “You have to stand on your head hundred time”, that people will be liking it much more than anything else. The reason is we have this ego which makes a fool out of us. You want to feel that you are doing something about it. How can you do it without doing anything? That is what the human mind is. It is such a foolish thing, when you’ll realize, you’ll really laugh at yourself. It's so childish. Like a person going in an airplane, he was a villager, he was told not to carry too much luggage. So, he carried a little luggage but he put that luggage on his head. So, people said, “What are you doing?” He said, ”I am trying to reduce the weight of the plane”.

And in the same way, we are trying to reduce the weight of that great Divine by our small little efforts. And he says, “All right, go ahead for a while”.

Like in Gita, Krishna befooled everyone when he said, "All right, you go ahead". Krishna was a great diplomat, a very great diplomat. It was beyond human mind to understand what a diplomat he is. A spontaneous diplomat he was! And he would deal with you, diplomatically. In his first, very first outset, he said that, "You seek it within", to Arjuna, who was another human being and the mediocre both, put together. So, Arjuna says, "Oh Lord, you tell me to seek that within, and then you tell me to go to war". What Krishna meant was that, “You become a witness of the play of the Divine whether you are in the war or in the house or in the jungle, then it's just the same”. But when Arjuna put such a question to him, it was like the son trying to drive a cart without the horse, and the horse stand behind it. So, the father says, "All right, go ahead my child, go on beating the cart, you'll reach there one day, definitely you are going to reach there".

So, Krishna has put such absurd conditions which no human mind has been able to see, it shocks to the most. First of his condition was that, whatever work you are going to do, what karmas you are going to do, put the fruit of that on the Lord: it’s an absurd thing! You just can't do it! Whatever work you are going to do, there you feel you are going to do it. You don't feel that it is happening or working you think that you are doing it. You put the fruit of that at the feet of the Lord is an absurd condition. It cannot be. It is just like, as I told you, the horse is behind the cart. So, he said, "Let them go ahead with this".

And I was surprised to see people have written books after books, bachelor after bachelor, they give lectures after lectures on this quote that, "You must put the fruit of your karmas at the feet of the Lord". And some of them believe also, that they are doing this work. None of them are doing it, I must tell you. In England, as you might say, it might be that you are just teaching your style. But the difference is, I am a mother. So, I have to, I have to tell you the truth. Then see, there's another absurd statement he has made, how he has tried to befool you. It's very interesting, know, the way Krishna has befooled you all the ages and we have been befooled.

Everyone had their own style Christ had his own and Krishna had his own. So, for 'bhakti' he says, for worshiping God, Krishna says, "You do bhakti. You must do bhakti. But do 'ananya' bhakti". Now this 'ananya' is a very wonderful word. When you worship Him 'ananya'. And 'ananya' means: 'when there is not the other'. When you have become one, ‘ananya’. When you are one, why should you do bhakti? When the drop becomes the sea, what bhakti he is going to do? To whom to worship? You yourself become that, where are you going to do the bhakti kavach?

Nobody has felt the absurdity of this kind of a bhakti. He says that, "First of all, the word 'ananya' is to be used. That is, 'ananya' means, you should become one. That is when you become completely Self-realised. it means that. Once you are completely Self-realised, then what bhakti are you going to do? [Laughter] Understand? You see, the whole thing is nothing but a complete diplomacy of Shri Krishna who was a spontaneously diplomat. His diplomacy, if our diplomats learn, all our problems will be solved. To make fool of everyone and make them understand that this is all absurd, so they come back to the reality.
