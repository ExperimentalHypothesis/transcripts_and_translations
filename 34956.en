[Introduction in Hindi for 50 seconds.]

Yesterday, we discussed the existence of Kundalini, your divine mother in your being, which is born with you. Every time we take birth, it is with you. It records all that you are.

Today, we will discuss Sahaja Yoga. This is a name I have given, as people call it, but actually, it is not my name. This name has been used by many sages and many seers and even by Shri Krishna. ‘Sahaja’ is a Sanskrit word. It means, ‘saha’ is ‘with’. ‘Ja’ means born. ‘Yog’ has two meanings. ‘Yog’ means ‘union’. It is the union, or we can call it, re-union. And also, it has another meaning. ‘Yog’ means deftness. An expert with deftness in his job. It also means [unclear] as they call it. But the real meaning of ‘yoga’ is that after the re-union with the All-pervading Power, with your own awareness, you become deft in the art of religion.

This is a real religion of yoga. And there are various schools of yogas. For example, there is Patanjali Yoga, which discusses and explains how we can build up a mental and a physical side of your life. There is [unclear] Yoga and various yogas which are described by different seers and philosophers.

Now, Sahaja Yoga, is a yoga which integrates all the yogas, which covers all the knowledge of the world. It covers all the aspect of religion and all the religions and all the prophets that have been and that will be. Because Sahaja Yoga is the system employed by nature itself, by the Divine itself, by God himself, whether you call it God or anything. It is awareness I am talking about.

Whatever is living, as you have seen, lives by itself, spontaneously, grows by itself. No amount of effort can make a seed grow. You may stand on your head, you may do Patanjali Yoga, you may read [unclear] Yoga, you may read any yoga whatsoever, nothing can manifest, if it is living, without the spontaneity of awareness.

Actually, human beings do not do anything that is living. They do everything that is dead. That is, when we change the form of dead, from one to another, we say we have created matter. We have not. Matter exists; we just change the forms. Sometimes, we get a thought from within, spontaneously, and we note it down. We think we have done it. It is not so. It has come to you from somewhere, which you have just noted down. What human beings can do is to read some books and reproduce them. But if they have to produce anything original, they have to depend on the spontaneity of their awareness. The more you are aware, the more you are spontaneous.

Even Einstein, such a great scientist, in his introductory chapter, he says that, “I was trying to search out the methods to explain the relativity and the hypothesis that I was  carrying on. I was so very tired that I gave it up. And I was sitting in a garden, playing with soap bubbles”. Now this is his sentence, “Then, suddenly, from somewhere unknown, the theory of relativity dawned upon me. Method was done”. It just comes to you. You cannot achieve it. That's why, in the Bible, they call it 'revelation', it just reveals itself. That's the correct word. So, even whatever abstract you try to communicate to human beings, which is living, is not done by us. But in all ignorance, human beings believe that they are doing everything. And that is why we have tensions and problems. Once we know we are doing nothing, we are just a tool in the hands of the Divine, only thing we must surrender ourselves to the whims of the Divine, and to the play of the Divine and become a hollow personality, we will know that all the problems so far do not exist. Because our attitude changes [unclear].

Psychologists have described awareness, the later one, I should say the latest ones, have really been able to locate various points of awareness. But as all our scientists are, they are not integrated. Because when the psychologists also try to explain the awareness, they do it with their limitations of ego and super ego. For example, I want to explain about this hall and my eyes are blind. What can I explain but that there's a pillar? I can feel it and I can say there was a serpent hanging here out.

Yogis also have described about their experiences. In the same manner, the knowledge I do not think has been so complete to explain all the aspects of awareness. And half-knowledge is the most dangerous thing. That is why certain yogis like Patanjali Yogis, describe that you must do yoga. And with yoga, you can achieve good health. But they did not know what are the effects of the yoga asanas on the Kundalini and on the achievement of Self-realised state. Actually, human being is one identity. And every scientist and a seer and a psychologist are seeing them in different angles. And they have not been able to put them together. Nor have they been able to keep their vision that wise has to see that after all, the ultimate aim of a human being, is Self-realisation. All these scientists must lead to Self-realisation.

If you read my speeches that they have given on Sahaja Yoga, you will know that by putting any effort, we act on our sympathetic nervous system. I mean the exhausting system. For example, the petrol is built from here, into our being when we are small children. Then our head is blocked, we become a separate identity. 'Iness' is developped, 'I', "Hama ma". 'I'. Now with this little battery that we have we are exhausting it by using our sympathetic nervous system. All the doctors know that when we work or do anything we work with our sympathetic nervous system. For example, when we want to increase the breathing, we can do that. Because it is sympathetic nervous system, we can bring into play. But supposing I ask you to reduce your breathing rate you cannot do it. Same with the heart. You can get into tension but you cannot relax. This is done by parasympathetic.

You ask the doctors what is parasympathetic, they'll say that it is an autonomous nervous system, finished! It's an autonomous nervous system they have given a name that should be satisfying for all of us. And we don't know what to do with that. But if you tell the doctors that, “Sir, it may be that somebody knows about the autonomous nervous system, would you like to have a look at it?” They’ll immediately say, “Can you prove it scientifically?” It can we proved scientifically if people are willing to sit down and listen. But the person who wants to tell about it may be just a housewife.

It is absolutely scientific that parasympathetic nervous system can be controlled by human beings themselves. The autonomous nervous system can be controlled if you know how to control the ‘auto’. And they call it “svayam’. What is this ‘svayam’, what is this ‘auto’? If we can some way or other be that auto, we might be able to control that autonomous nervous system, by which we can neutralize the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and can cure all the troubles of the sympathetic. For example, cancer is nothing but the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Through Sahaja Yoga, we have definitively cured of course, absolutely cured cancer patients. Of course, I mean, that's not my intention. That’s not. To cure people is not my intention at all. It is just a byproduct of Sahaja Yoga, just a byproduct. Because as soon as you become the controller of that ‘auto’, you become part auto [unsure]. Now here's the doctor, she will understand what I'm saying, that there are seven plexuses which are controlled by the parasympathetic and the sympathetic. By sympathetic, we are using all the power that is within us, like the petrol we are exhausting. Now, by some means, if we can open the scalp here, and put ourselves all the time filling with that petrol, we can never be exhausted. And all the problems that arise from that exhaustion will not arise. It is such a simple thing, is the simplest thing which should happen to us.

After all, we are created for some purpose. Not for running away from ourselves. We are not created to hate ourselves. We are created to know ourselves. Our Self, the Self which is nothing but completeintegration of beauty, love and knowledge. And knowledge that I care after you. What’s Self? It cannot be defined. All the knowledge of the world comes from that ocean [unclear]. All the beauty of the world manifests from that thing. All the love that we have had [unclear] are just nothing but the pure showers of that ocean.

With the sympathetic nervous system, when we start exhausting ourselves, we develop an ego and a superego. Everyone. You see, one shouldn't think that, some people say I'm egoless”. There is no question how you speak to other. Some people say, “There are very beautiful people”. That's not the point. Nobody is ugly according to my judgment. But what I am saying, that they are not aware of their beauty.The ego and superego, both exist in all of us because of our sympathetic activity, means going out. With the sympathetic activity, we go out, get ourselves involved outside and exhaust the little energy that is within ourselves.
