[Introduction in Hindi for 50 seconds.]

Yesterday, we discussed the existence of Kundalini, your divine mother in your being, which is born with you. Every time we take birth, it is with you which records all that you are.

Today, we will discuss Sahaja Yoga. This is a name I have given, as people call it, but actually, it is not my name. This name has been used by many sages and many seers and even by Shri Krishna. ‘Sahaja’ is a Sanskrit word. It means, ‘saha’ is ‘with’. ‘Ja’ means born. ‘Yog’ has two meanings. ‘Yog’ means ‘union’. It is the union, or we can call it, re-union. And also, it has another meaning. ‘Yog’ means just an expert with deft in joy. It also means councillor as they call it. But the real meaning of ‘yoga’ is that after the re-union with the All-pervading Power, with your own awareness, you become deft in the art of religion.

This is a real religion of yoga. And there are various courses of yogas. For example, there is Patanjali Yoga, which discusses and explains how we can build up a mental and a physical side of your life. There is [unclear] Yoga and various yogas which are described by different seers and philosophers.

Now, Sahaja Yoga, is a yoga which integrates all the yogas, which covers all the knowledge of the world. It covers all the aspect of religion and all the religions and all the prophets that have been and that will be. Because Sahaja Yoga is the system employed by nature itself, by the Divine itself, by God himself, whether you call it God or anything. It is awareness I am talking about.

Whatever is living, as you have seen, lives by itself, spontaneously, grows by itself. No amount of effort can make a seed grow. You may stand on your head, you may do Patanjali Yoga, you may do [unclear] Yoga, you may do any yoga whatsoever, nothing can manifest, if it is living without the spontaneity of awareness.

Actually, human beings do not do anything that is living. They do everything that is dead. That is, when we change the form of dead, from one to another, we say we have created matter. We have not. Matter exists; we just change the forms. Sometimes, we get a thought from within, spontaneously, and we note it down. We think we have done it. It is not so. It has come to you from somewhere, which you have just noted down. What human beings can do is to read some books and reproduce them. But if they have to produce anything original, they have to depend on the spontaneity of their awareness. The more you are aware, the more you are spontaneous.

Even Einstein, such a great scientist, in his introductory chapter, he says that, “I was trying to search out the methods to explain the relativity and the hypothesis that I was  carrying on, I was so very tired, that I gave it up. And I was sitting in a garden, playing with soap bubbles”. Now this is his sentence, “Then, suddenly, somewhere unknown, the theory of relativity dawned upon me. Method was done”. It just comes to you. You cannot achieve it. That's why in the Bible they call it 'revelation', it just reveals itself. That's the correct word. So, even whatever abstract you try to communicate to human beings, which is living, is not done by us. But in all ignorance, human beings believe that they are doing everything. And that is why we have tensions and problems. Once we know we are doing nothing, we are just a tool in the hands of the Divine, only thing we must surrender ourselves to the whims of the Divine, and to the play of the Divine and become a hollow personality, we will know that all the problems so far do not exist. Because our attitude [unclear].

Psychologists have described awareness, the later one, I should say the latest ones, have really been able to locate various points of awareness. But as all our senses are, they are not integrated. Because when the psychologist also tries to explain the awareness, they do it with their limitations of ego and super ego.
