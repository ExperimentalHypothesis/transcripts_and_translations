Birthday Puja, (Shri Mataji’s first visit to Australia) Burwood, Sydney. March 21, 1981.

I’m just trying to remember if I had a more fantastic birthday than this! Where words do not come, there the joy cannot be expressed. When it becomes so deep that there is no movement.

This is a great country: Australia has been created for a special purpose in Sahaj Yoga. This is the Mooladhar Chakra where resides Shri Ganesh, of this world. How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

The information about my coming can only be broadcasted from this centre: then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

When you are putting your hands towards me then the Divine love passes through your fingers, goes down through your Ida and Pingala and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence; and then the Kundalini rises.

So today, we should say, is a great day in the history of Divine work, where I came to Australia.

They asked me, “Was there any incarnation in Australia? Did God visit Australia in human form?” I said, “It’s not easy to meet Shri Ganesh! Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.”

And you know that He is placed like a lotus where all kinds of people who are insulted, tortured, ignored are sent. Here He really decides whom to send to hell and whom not to send. 

God’s decisions are very different - they are above you. Human decisions are extremely cruel and dry.

And today you find so many saints in this Mooladhara. Definitely this is the work of Shri Ganesh. He has called you on this great chakra – where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha also, cannot enter in it. And you should stay here and grow into beautiful saints of very great magnitude in spirituality. Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing and such a blessing, that even Indians would be jealous of you.

One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us. It’s very important to recognise him, understand him and to imbibe, otherwise you will be wasting all his energies staying in this place, living in this place, so close to him.

And though he’s the giver of wisdom, I wonder how many people understand the word ‘wisdom’. Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us which gives us the fulcrum on which we rotate, by which we realise that we are inclined to the left or to the right. 

This fulcrum we have to be aware of, because otherwise we will not know how far we have gone. Not only [that], but you should know that it is so much the centre of gravity and our fulcrum so close. Because if your centre of gravity and fulcrum are separated there’s no integration: you can be ruined, completely. So wisdom means this integration between your understanding, and the understanding of Shri Ganesh within.

For example, we go to extremes; extremes of behaviour. I would give you a very simple example: I was going to Hong Kong and the lady who organised it telephoned to me again and again, and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you; and you are going to be on the television from the moment you land, and this is going to happen and that is going to happen,” Every day spending so much money describing the scene that I’ll be “a hot news” and all sorts of things that she was talking about.  And she was on and on and on and also she told Dr Warren. Except for giving the newspaper she didn’t have to pay for it. It was going too far.

At that juncture it was not necessary to go to such a limit and plan it out: that there would be people coming inside the aeroplane to receive me - makes no difference to me! - and there would be a car waiting near the aeroplane to take me to the airport, and I don’t know who was waiting where at every point! (laughing) And when we reached there it was six hours late and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, anything.” And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!  There was no way – six hours. And we had to take another plane in which nobody came in, no car, nothing: went down looking for her, couldn’t see her. I said, “Can you call to the..” They said, “No arrangements thrown.” Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme!” (laughter) Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport down there. It’s all a joke.

Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well, because if you get successful with your this kind of planning, then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning and not the planning of the Divine. The Divine has its own plans and we have to feel the plans of the Divine. It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out. So if you try to do something of your own, something too much, then who is going to suggest, “This is the balance,” is Shri Ganesh. And that balance, once it’s established in you, you know how you should balance yourself.  

There is no alternative for Sahaj Yog, no alternative; one must know. Everything that is living has no alternatives. For example, if a mango tree says that, “I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot! There’s no alternative. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy; but not to force its way on it.

This is one of the things we have to understand to establish our wisdom. Because of our concept, our idea, our anything, even about God for example, about our achievements itself, can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom. But in nature, if you see, those who grow are never bothered about what shape they are going to take, do they? Does a tree measure itself up to know how many dimensions it is going to grow? It grows as much as it can, slowly, steadily, the coordination of the nature is.

Like that the wisdom is the one that understands. It is an establishment, it’s  a state of mind. We can say it’s the state of being, when you become wisdom.

Such a wisdom, outside, is also expressed so beautifully. Such a wisdom gives you gentleman and a gentlelady, only in a personality which is settled down. If you are frustrated with the problem, if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed, any extreme will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow. So even in frustration you have to look back and you have to stand back and see for yourself, “What am I to be frustrated about?”

Count your blessings one by one, count your blessings one by one.  I’ll say again, count your blessings one by one. Once you start counting  your blessings, you will find, in such a short time, where are you.

Now the  extreme projections of mind can take you to: “I’m not going to ???” And you would like to do it.

But in wise projection, you can say this, that you are what you have to be. You are saints. You were born to be saints in this great country. You are specially blessed people in the heavens and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

You have achieved that state. And if you are saints you should not be bothered as to a few things like, “Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase,” or something sort of a thing like that; which you have never been very much bothered before. You are saints.

And any kind of extreme behaviour. For example, for materialism you people are not so bad, in the sense [that] you understand the value of aesthetics. But in possessiveness let us take the wise path, wisdom; logically, it has to be logical: what do we possess in this world? Just think of one thing that we can possess. 

Except for your own Spirit you don’t possess anything. Except for your evolutionary development you don’t possess anything. For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always – this is what you possess. The rest you don’t possess. It’s logical, logical. You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying. So why should we worry about our possessions?

When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom, this is a higher wisdom which you develop within yourself . And If we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved. ‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea, but the attachment to it dissolves, and it is solved. 

Like, Kay lost her travellers’ cheques, she did not throw them away. Suddenly one man bumped into her. I was with her. He said, “Imagine, I never knew I am going to meet you! When I went to a particular cashier or somewhere he said, ‘Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers’ cheques with me.’ And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

How the news has been organised, in the nature you see when the flowers bloom, how these bees come all the way; how the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia. What wisdom is that magnetism in them, the  magnetism that is in the Mother Earth which tells them this is the way you have to go.

So we have to see to this magnetism within us: what makes us magnetic is not what we put up, what unnatural things we have, but what naturally we have achieved within and we are not afraid to express. 

In fear you are never aggressive, but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive. In fear you might say that you are not afraid but you could be aggressive. When people look very frightened, if you push them to the extreme of fright, they can come back, but if you are fearless, you are in the centre, you are just standing there and watching.

Fearlessness never means aggression.

So the confusion of our concepts can only be cleared out if there is light within us. For us, if somebody is aggressing us then you think [that] if we do not aggress the other person we are frightened of them, then we are weak, we are weak  people; so we should fight back. Even when you are fighting back you are weak people. If it was not so, what is there to fight back?

In fearlessness you become the witness. You see the joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person,  and also you know the technique kaushalam (कौशलं). Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique: how to manage the show by which his action doesn’t trouble you also; if you want to. If you don’t want, you can even take the action upon yourself, to prove it that, “Whatever you are doing is a little silly and stupid.” Like Christ getting Himself crucified. It was a wise decision because if you have to prove that life is eternal, the best thing is to die and show. And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody should say that He was not dead. Still there are many people who are saying that He was not dead! Still there are people who are talking like this: “He was not dead. He was alive. So he got out of the place.” Because they don’t know how to explain. 

So He had to die publicly and then his resurrection was to be seen by many people. This drama had to be performed for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal. It doesn’t mean that He was weak, by any chance. 

So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression, both come from either fear or some sort of a satanic pleasure to oppress others.

So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also. See how wisdom is so important.

 Throughout if you find, in every chakra, within it lies pranava - is the life of every chakra. Because it is the wisdom that tells you whether you are in a chakra or not. So how wisdom is important that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom, otherwise you cannot. You become a witness only when you have that focal point adjusted to your centre of gravity. That is wisdom.

When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing, as if it was another war that was fought. Then you go and listen to another side, they paint another horrible picture of this side. Between these two pictures, you find the one is reflecting the other, the other is reflecting the other. There’s no end to it, it’s eternally going on from this to that, that to this. How do you end it up? Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected is just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it. The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror and don’t worry about the reflections: they’ll come and go. It is for you just to witness it, that’s all. The mirror is a mirror which is a solid thing and all the reflections are illusions. That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

Wisdom lies in the understanding that you are the Spirit. You are not all these illusions, you are the Spirit, you are the Spirit.

The attention was, as animals, was on food only you can say: you develop food, nothing else but food. This grows higher and higher in awareness and you came up to a point where he started thinking that he is the prime minister or he is an actor or an actress and this and that a so-called they have achieved; or maybe they start thinking they are atheists and all sorts of things, communists, specialists (laughter).

It’s a drama going on. They are wearing wigs after wigs. If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away. This has killed the romance completely! You start loving the wigs of a person! And wigs can be bought, they could be exchanged. You go into the market and you can get, say, about ten types of wigs. Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,” so the lady will go and wear that and come out, and then you will like her for the wig that she has bought. Then another may wear the same, or this same lady who looked nice with one wig could bore you completely because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma.  

Every moment is so beautiful. It breaks into new waves of such beautiful colours and beautiful music. That’s all lost with these bought images.

Every minute the image changes with a living personality into tremendous beauty. But the first point is the wisdom to know that our images cannot be purchased or bought  or created or made: they evolve!

So we have to only see to our evolving force: are we nearer it or are we out of it? Are we moving with our evolving force of getting ourselves crucified with all these artificial misidentifications that says that, “You are this, you are that.” You are nothing but a seeker. It’s category I have told, many a times, that you are a seeker and you have to seek. Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit. And once you have found it, establish yourself on that. That’s what you are! And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying; is itself emitting wisdom which is so joy giving, and is nothing but love. It’s love, I tell you.  I mean I cannot go beyond this: there’s no word in human language to say what is love. To me it is nothing but silence, everything stops at that point. Just feeling it within yourself; where the wisdom becomes love, and love becomes wisdom, that’s the real integration of life.

Open your hearts, allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that, that innocence which enhances everything. Look at the little ones how they came forward to give me flowers: every step, every movement was so joyous, was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart. And it’s written as history for me, to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward.

And the wisdom becomes so powerful, that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you. For him, he did not know anybody else but one: that which  is the source of love.

Never questioning, never argued: no alternatives. No new ideas came to his mind, he’s just taking in. Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

The more you enter into it you will understand that you have really entered the Kingdom of God where He looks after everything: you want a house? All right, have it! What do you want? You want that? Have it! (laughter) Take care of your problem? Have it. It’s all God’s own thing. Who owns it but God? He is the One who owns everything and He’s the One who enjoys everything, and He wants you to enjoy everything. It’s only through the power of wisdom that you can achieve it.

Today, though I had to show a part of that achievement in wisdom in which there is no artificial; it’s so natural. But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some people think to be angry is also natural. But you are a human being and  a Sahaj Yogi. Whatever is natural to a Sahaj Yogi is not the same as whatever is natural to a buffalo! We have nothing to learn from them, they have to learn from us. 

So whatever is natural to a Sahaj Yogi has to be learnt in the school of wisdom. Not by any rules, or anything that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!” “You are not to do like that.” “You are not to do this way!” Not that.

Even in the hand if you see, this portion is Australia (Shri Mataji points to base of Her hand where the Mooladhara is). Now just see, this portion is the source for all the fingers, is the connecting point, is this point, but it doesn’t say anything. For example, this finger means something, this thumb means something, this finger means something, this means something, but this [base] doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything. But without this nothing exists. If it is cut out here, you are paralysed, all the movement is finished. This is the connecting link with the Divine and the guiding link. This only tells which finger to move, where to take, how much to contract, which person. All of this is controlled in this portion.

A day will come when the information will reach the whole world through the awakening of Ganesha in my children, the Sahaji Yogis in Australia. And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming from Shri Ganesh.

Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India and only then this Kundalini can rise.

But one thing you must remember is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point and that the responsibility is too much on you. And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus. Though, maybe, you will feel you are surrounded by all mud and everything, but still you have to be very strong lotuses. For the whole world you have to come up and send forth that beautiful fragrance of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

I was asking for the river’s name, what’s the name of the river. I wonder if you thought about it. See, the river’s name is Parramatta. ‘Parra’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ and ‘Matta’ means ‘the mother’. Your river’s name itself is Parramatta. It’s a Greek word, and how the Greeks have known of this word ‘Parramatta’? This river had to be here, the Adishakti only had to be here, to bless Shri Ganesha all the time which has to work hard.

He’s the one who sorts out: Lambodara. The one you see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out. It’s a huge big stomach. It’s really an Australian character, personality, standing there sorting out people. Throwing left  and to the right. It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get that picture some time. And you will be surprised – it’s an Australian, you can see it perfectly. It’s an Australian character. That is Christ. Absolutely an Australian body, standing up. I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly, that He had to be Australian like that one.

It has been so beautiful to come down, so beautiful.

It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy, complete joy.

I had told I will not do anything after three years time, I will just settle down. Because the saintly person is not supposed to move from places to places, they must settle, they must have their own ground – that’s called as takiya, and you are not to leave that. But I am your Mother, moving all over. 

And, can you imagine, I have been to all the world’s places, but never to Australia before, so to come here first thing was so great that even today I have not been able to put all that into words.

May God bless you!
