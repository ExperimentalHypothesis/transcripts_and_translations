Yogini: Mother, it's Mathias on the phone again, it's Mathias on the phone again, he's talking about lamb and things, he wants to talk about the lamb.

Shri Mataji: Lamb? Huh? Should I go in the room or?

Yogini: Is there a telephone extension in here?

Yogi: Yes. Yogini: Is there a point from the wall? Can anyone say point from the wall?

Yogini: Otherwise, there's one in the kitchen, Mother, which...

Shri Mataji: There's a meat company, you can talk to the meat company, I think Frank can do something about it. So he wants to have an offer as soon as possible. Isn't it? It's a good solution. It's maybe for this also you'll find this, but first of all this, there must be meat companies here.

Yogini: Oh, I'm sure there are, mother. As you say, Frank would be there.

Shri Mataji: [unclear]. And the meat. [unclear] To Poland. Both. To Poland and to Bulgaria.
