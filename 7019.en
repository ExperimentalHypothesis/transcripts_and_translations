Talk about Forthcoming India Tour. Shudy Camps (UK), 13 November 1988.

It’s a nice occasion that we could all meet together on this auspicious day. And actually today is the day of the brothers and sisters. It’s also very nice that you are all meeting your brothers and sisters here and enjoying this Diwali function. We had a very nice function in India and it was celebrated in Bombay and they all send you their good wishes and Happy Diwali to all of you. They all remembered you very much.

Now, today I am not going to give you a speech but I have to tell you certain things about the Indian Tour that we are going to have because I don’t think I’ll be able to talk to you about it later on. So first of all I wanted to know the girls who are engaged in India. Can you get up and – anyone of them are here? Those girls who were engaged in India. They are not here, none of them? So I hope the leaders know who were the girls engaged in their areas, isn’t it? Now you have to see that the boys and the girls who were engaged. Are there boys who were engaged in your area?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Anybody? From Graz?

Sahaja Yogi: Thomas [Voltrum].

Shri Mataji: Two boys from Graz.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. And Thomas Voltrum to, he’s engaged to the daughter of [Tumal]. And.

Shri Mataji: Ah. But he is not getting married this year.

Sahaja Yogi: Ha.

Shri Mataji: What? No, no, from, from Graz.

Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know, Shri Mataji. [There’s no guarantee of his marriage or quit or.] The another is Martin, Shri Mataji. They are both on the tour.

Shri Mataji: They are both on the tour. So in the same way one should know that, say that, all those girls who are engaged anywhere, or the boys who are engaged, must come on this tour. And you should consult Me, all of you, all the leaders, sometimes, tomorrow, to finalize those who are coming, those who are not coming, and their photographs, and their forms. I hope you have brought with you.

You decided now on certain things which your leaders must have told you that those people who are on the tour shouldn’t bring too many clothes and too many ? what they call them – toiletries, specially for the ladies. Because some people have complained that their hands started paining the way they had to handle all these heavy things.

So to be kind to them is to bring a, some sort of a soft bag, and we are supplying you with six kurtas and six pajamas and also undergarments for thirty-six pounds only. You paid about, I think, twenty-eight pounds for one kurta pajama in London. So this is going to be there. Plus for the ladies, we’ve got six saris and six blouses and six petticoats, very good quality, only for again thirty-six pounds. We had put it thirty pounds but we just cut it very, very sharp. So we have put it thirty-six pounds, means one pound we have increased on every item, for all the ladies. So please don’t bring too many Western clothes. There’s no need. Whatever you travel with you can travel back with. And there are saris and petticoats, everything available for you. We are working it out on your, the way you have sent your measurements, and you know how difficult it is for so many people. Six hundred, seven hundred saris I have bought so far. But if there are more ladies who is going to come, I don’t know, we’ll have to again arrange.

Imagine seven hundred saris and then the saris have to be matched with blouses and the saris have to be also matched with the petticoats and every person has a different measurement. So what a combination it is. Just put it mathematically, I don’t know what raised to what. And say with the boy is simple, is that their measurements are different, but a boy’s cloth is the same, not such a problem, because ladies can’t have the same saris like a uniform. So we had to buy different colors, different things. So it’s all, we have done all this work for you, so that you don’t bring big, big, huge suitcases.

And now there’s another decision has been taken: anybody brings a very heavy, huge suitcase will be left in Bombay. Nobody’s going to carry it. You know, once we broke our, one of the top of the buses, and this time the bus people refused that, “We will not give you any buses anymore because you put very heavy luggage on that.” So I have to make a very, very specific request to you that please don’t bring big bags. You can buy something nice in India if you want to bring some more things from there. But just now, for just for going and coming what you have to do is to think about the saris that you have already and also one sleeping bag with a foam of about three inches. That’s a thing we have now failed because we tried to make some mattresses in India – were spoilt by rain. So foam is the best thing, about three inches on your sleeping bag, in your. Everybody should bring a sleeping bag. No need.

Everybody should bring a sleeping bag, and in the sleeping, sleeping bag you should have three inches to four inches of foam, three by six, and which you leave it in India, and I don’t think they will, you’ll have any trouble afterwards. The ones there we had brought before were very thin ones. They are no good. So this time bring only three to four inches of foam, just ordinary foam. In India also we get foam. The problem is the foam is not that good and it might just give Me. So it’s better to bring foam from here. And try to avoid to bring unnecessary things. There’s no need to bother because all the presents and all that I’m going to carry for you. So you don’t have to worry.

Those who have still thinking whether to go or not to go, should decide immediately, because it’s going to be difficult. Last minute if somebody wants to come, it’s impossible. Last time some people had to walk because we cannot have a bus for five people who are coming late, or ten people who are coming late. So the best thing is, you should all decide those who want to come and should pay your money and complete the whole thing. Money should be paid as soon as possible because I’ll be going on this Sunday. So it should be something, tomorrow or day after, you must, should be able to pay all your money. All the leaders must pay their money and should manage to show.

Now the marriages, proposals and all that, we have got already and all the leaders must give marriage proposals to Me tomorrow, which we’ll decide here and we’ll finalize it here, as many as possible. And then we have to ask people. But now one should not be also sort of, some people say, “We don’t want to marry Indians.” Some people say, “We don’t want to.” Specially Australians did say so. But now we discover that all Australians were caught up. One person went who was horrible. All were caught up except for the Indians. Indians don’t catch. They don’t catch, they don’t have ego. And egos are stupid, idiotic things they do, very stupid and idiotic things with ego. So that’s what it is. They don’t catch. They don’t do these things. I mean, they are consistent. So to say, “We’ll not have Indians,” it’s, it’s another nonsensical thing. I mean, Indians could say, “We don’t want this country, that country,” but that’s not Sahaja. So one should not say like that. There’s one thing good about them: they never catch. And they don’t lose their vibrations. We have one single example so far in India who got vibrations and lost it, one person among all of them. So that’s one thing about them, they don’t lose their vibrations. Maybe somebody who has come here might have lost, I don’t know. But as far as India is concerned, one single example we know.

So this is the point one has to remember, not to say, “I don’t want to marry an Indian. I don’t want to marry an Egyptian. I don’t want to marry a certain thing.” This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga. We do not believe in caste, creed, race or any country. If you are so conscious about your races you better give up Sahaja Yoga. It’s a simple thing as that, because now it has been shown clearly that we have false ideas about ourselves. So this is another point that you should not say.

Of course, I mean if you don’t want to go out of your country you can say, “I don’t want to go out of my country.” That’s a different thing. But what is your country? That means you are not yet in Sahaja. If you are in the ocean of Sahaja then you don’t think. Ocean doesn’t say that, “This is my shore. That is my shore.” It’s just an ocean. If you have understood Sahaja then you must accept Sahaj ways of life. And one of them is we are not to believe in all these nonsensical ideas of boundaries that have come to us. You could have been born in anywhere. And you are told from childhood that you are English or you are Indian, you are this, you are that. It’s all conditioning, and a very subtle conditioning; we should get rid of it. It’s better that we try now to get rid of it. And if you don’t feel like marrying you can say that, “We don’t want to marry.” Nobody’s forced in Sahaja Yoga, as you know that. You must tell Me beforehand. No brainwashing, nothing. In all your freedom, in all your glory, you must say, “Yes”. Otherwise I will not allow you to marry anyone. No compulsion of any kind. I’ve told you hundred times: nobody is compelled. If you don’t want to marry, just say, “No”, that’s all.

So after this, this time the program is all very fine in Ganapatipule because I have kept two days extra. On the 29th will finish but 30th and 31st, two days for all of you to go to Alliabag. Now, some people if they are leaving later on also can stay in Alliabag for no more payment or anything, and those who are, have to leave, on the 1st can leave from Alliabag.

So two days we have kept there where married couples can meet and can decide about things. So it will be time for you to decide what you want to do and talk to your bride or your husband, whatever may be the case, so that there’s no problem on that. And you should, then it won’t happen that you get married and run away, sort of a thing, won’t happen. So you will meet each other and that will be a nice time to talk to each other, find out about others.

Now, any questions, you please ask Me, just now, about going to India. One more point they were saying that, “Supposing we come for ten days or five days.” All right, it’s all right. Can we arrange, but you have to come on your own. We can’t arrange your coming and also the payment part. You have to pay because we have to pay a wholesale price for everything.

So this time we cannot give concessions of that kind that we did last time because everything is now catered. A catering is there. It’s not done by Sahaja Yoga. So we have to pay the caterer the money beforehand. And if you don’t pay, who is going to pay, is the point. So if you can’t pay just don’t come. If you can pay come along. And the minimum of minimum, we have tried to keep everything minimum of minimum. So can you imagine in thirty-six pounds you can’t get six saris, six petticoats, six blouses, anywhere. Rommel must be wondering, “How am I going to manage? It’s impossible.” But this has happened. You are lucky people. That’s all I can say.

So, no question? Kya? [Hindi]. No questions. No question? [Hindi] Havya, you are going to come? He is willing to marry her.

Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Ma.

Shri Mataji: Anybody who has questions please ask now or let Me know before I leave, all right? Any question.

[Apart: Now what about Nicholas? Is he, is he divorced his wife or not?]

Sahaja Yogi: It’s, it’s not actually final I’m sure [inaudible]. It’s not actually finalized but it, it started.

Shri Mataji: Now, let him come and see Me.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: We have decided to have some music program for this evening for a while, and then tomorrow is the Puja. And then in the evening they have invited some people for some music program, tomorrow evening. So, you can ask them to sing or something.

Sahaja Yogi: [unclear]

Shri Mataji: And more things you should announce is, those who have not yet send their forms and should do it now. There are many people who might not have sent any forms so far.

Sahaja Yogi: Right. I think we have most of the forms now.

Shri Mataji: You have told them.

Sahaja Yogi: Achcha. [Apart: Any song you know].

Shri Mataji: He has told everyone that those who have not sent their forms should do it now.

So let’s have the music [bhajan] or I don’t know how will end it.

Sahaja Yogi: So I think, they, they’ve been rehearsing on one song. It is one song which they’ve been rehearsing.

Shri Mataji: All right, if they sit out, is still raining, that’s why.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s quite so bad now, I think, Shri Mataji. Wherever, wherever You like.

Shri Mataji: It’s just the same, throughout.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s coming, still coming, yes.

Shri Mataji: I mean, you all have to sit with an umbrella. It is said about England that people have to play footballs with their umbrella on their heads. That’s England, you see. So England doesn’t want you to forget that you are sitting under the roof of an English sky. So whatever it is, wherever they’ll sing. So I could sit...

Sahaja Yogi: I can manage as thus.

Shri Mataji: And you can just turn it round.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, as You wish Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yeah, yeah, I could sit that side.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. And I’m watching this side.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

Sahaja Yogini: Hello, Olympia. How are you?

Olympia (child): Very nice.

Sahaja Yogini: Very nice?
