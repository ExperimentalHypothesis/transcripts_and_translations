Swadishthan Chakra.

The quality of this Chakra is that you become creative. Your creativity increases. People who never even wrote a line, start writing poetry. People who had never given a speech started giving  long speeches and people who had never painted, never been artistic, become artistic. Become very creative. We have our architects, who  have scaled great heights. So creativity comes into human, and he believes that his creativeness is very important. He does not care about money, he cares about being creative and neither do many people want to get a big name, for which create some or the other weird thing.

Then he doesn’t have any worry or preference for the money, that look at the money, and not care about how the creativity is. Nor do people then think that they should get famous, and for that they wouldn’t end up making something morbid. You know some of the strange things that get made these days. Why? That this will help us become famous; that people will remember us for this. But in that, there is no art.

So, the portion of art that exists in there, you realise that when this second chakra of yours, the Swadhishthan, becomes alright. And because of this Swadhisthan, when we think, we use the power of the grey cells in our brain. And this feeds that power; this chakra.

You know, people who overthink, they get all sorts of diseases. We call them right sided illnesses. One of those is that the liver may get spoilt, or else you may get diabetes in the Pancreas. If not that, he might get kidney trouble, or if not then constipation. Or if even not that, then it might be asthma.. or then, there may also be a heart attack. Or in the extreme, he might also get Paralysis. So the right sided diseases, they come from the SwadhishtanChakra. Now, the left sided illnesses – they also come from this same chakra.

Now how the Kundalini takes care of the Swadishthan Chakra and gives it..... that when you awaken the Kundalini of somebody and his Swadishthan Chakra is caught then in the back, where the Swadishthan Chakra is there, you will think there is heart over there. When there is fast throbbing, you know that this man’s Swadishthan Chakra is caught. When is right Swadishthan is cleared, then his attention become pure and all the stress etc. which is within him nowadays is finished and he becomes settled in peace.

Nowadays it is very important that we keep our Swadishthan Chakra in good condition as we are burdened with innumerable workloads nowadays. By keeping the Swadishthan Chakra clear, however much the human is troubled or he has any problems , he sees them in a peaceful and detached way and he understands what has gone wrong. Means that his Swadishthan Chakra gets so much spoilt nowadays and so many illnesses are caused. Everything is there, but there is some specialty of the Swadishthan Chakra that it is so bad in this Modern age.

Then there are also those other diseases, I don’t want to go into their details but will say this that other than diseases, human being become very dissatisfied and becomes very angry. Becomes right sided. In little little thing he is short-tempered, he feels that I am a man of my such a position but no one respects me. A nobody also believes that he is important person. This happens due to the right side Swadishthan and when the left side Swadishthan gets caught then the Person becomes very worried and sad. He becomes depressed and he thinks that there is nobody worse than me. Everybody is troubling me. I have problems. All kinds of psychological cases happen.

So these two sides of the Chakra, the left and right, should be taken great care of and this is very useful thing in Sahaja Yoga because both these chakras become cleared. When they are clear then you understand everything as if you are watching yourself from the outside.  Oh....so now you are getting angry...., take a seat, you laugh at yourself. Make fun of yourself.  You think about yourself .....Yes what I do....what I am doing.... so in this way human put his attention in that place and your attention becomes enlightened and it corrects the attention. Sahaja Yoga is very important for the Swadishthan Chakra and nowadays all the problems are due to the Swadishthan, this I ........
