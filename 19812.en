Leaving Dollis Hill

Shri Mataji: When did you come back?

Yogi: I am here some of the time but I still have to do things in Exeter.

Shri Mataji: He goes back? Is it?

Yogi: I have to go back so often for work. I should be free of it soon Mother.

Yogini: He has to go back so often but he’ll be free soon Mother.

Shri Mataji: Alright.

Yogi: I owe money, you see, down there Mother.

Yogini: He says he earns money down there Mother

Shri Mataji: Is it?

Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: I see. You sing there.

Yogi: Yeah, but I also owe some money and I have to pay it and until I pay it I’m not really free of it.

Yogini: Ah, he owes money Mother.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Money seems to be the problem everywhere and it can be very sapping and it can be very funny.

Perhaps you do not know that we are just playing into the hands of lots of negative forces in this country and we are doing lots of things which are really against the Divine. And the curses, everybody will have to suffer. We really have to understand our responsibility.

Whatever you people are, Sahaja Yogis are, people are going to reap the benefit of God. If they are suffering, you are responsible for them, hundred percent.

One has to understand. If you are quarrelling amongst yourselves, there will be a problem of quarrelling in the country. You are the symbols for God. He knows you and whenever you are negative, you are helping the Satan.

And it’s a very sad day I must say. Everybody seems to be high handed. And I am not saying about Steve. Steve is not yet into this. But we have had big, bad problems here in this ashram. Horrible things have happened. I have never had such an experience in India; which is a poor country. Never such a thing! I mean, it’s the first time I have seen such a thing happening!

First of all we all must get properly employed. You must have your self-respect force you to have a job. You all must try to get a job. This I have been telling for the last six years, if you remember. We cannot be parasites and could be Sahaja Yogis - cannot. Everybody must find out a job  for oneself. Do whatever you please, but you must do some job.

Imagine in India people spend money on you people! I would never have any problem whatsoever to solve of this kind, in India - never. You know that very well. And when I’m so strict with them, thinking they are Indians, that all the money that they have gathered in Bombay, or in Delhi, or any place, is clamped, completely closed. And nobody can take a single pie out of that without my permission. Absolutely I have told the banks. And nobody’s unhappy about it. Not a single pie! But when we go, they make collections and whatever money they collect every pie of that is written down clearly. First of all they give all that money to me, then I give that money to them to spend. And every single pie that they spend they write it down. I may or may not read - is not the point. And whatever is left out, every single pie of that is put on my feet. I may put to any use or anything - that’s a different point. I may not even take it all - that’s a different point. But every pie! Nobody is without a job.

This parasitic nature of any other country may be excused but not of England. In England you cannot be a parasite because, I told you, that the heart of the universe is here, and if anything happens, you all will be held responsible.

Now you are going to another ashram (Chelsham Road) and you are going to stay there. Ashram is not a place for luxurious life, not at all, or lethargy and laziness, or for making money or living free! It’s absurd! It’s sinful, it’s blasphemy. That’s the place where you go to develop your inner being with all truthfulness to yourself!

Before Realisation this was alright, every way, but after Realisation you have to be very, very careful. It’s a tremendous thing to have Awakening, it’s a tremendous thing to have Realisation. It is, no doubt. But to maintain it, you must have, first of all, personal integrity. If you are bent upon deceiving yourself nobody can help you.
