Evening program the day before the Krishna Puja, Cabella Ligure (Italy), 4 August 2007.

I wanted to thank all of you for enjoying this wonderful music from different parts of America, and that shows Sahaja Yoga has a great chance - if it works out this way in America, it will work out everywhere. And it will give the peace and the joy of leading a spiritual life.

I’m so very happy to see all of you here, and all of you enjoying this - very encouraging for Me and very supportive of Sahaja Yoga. I bless you all, all from America and all rest, so I’m told that you are from different countries, so all the people I bless you.

We should know we are all one, there’s no need to fight, or no need to argue but let us enjoy the common thing as we enjoy this program tonight.

I hope you are comfortable here – I don’t know, I haven’t seen, I had no chance to see how your things are placed, but if you have any complaints or any problem please let me know (laughter and applause).

Thank you very much. Thank you.
