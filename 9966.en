I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

At the very outset we have to know that Truth is what it is. We cannot change it. It is, it has been and it will be. Whatever I'm going to tell you, you have to have a scientific mind towards it. Keep your mind open. And whatever I say to you, if it is proved, then you have to believe in it as honest people. The Truth is, that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings and this ego but you are the Pure Spirit. This is said by all the great prophets, by Incarnations, by Muhammad Sahab as well as our Christ, as well as by Moses also all Indian scriptures say the same.

The second Truth is, that there is a All-Pervading Divine Power and this Divine Power does all the living work. You see all the beautiful flowers here it's a miracle. They have come out of one seed. Our heart who runs our heart? We don't even bother to know who runs our heart. This AllPervading Power of Divine Love, runs our heart. It's like the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost or it is the Paramchaitanya or it is the Ruh. It's what? Ruh, in Quran. It is described by many names.

Those who are seekers of Truth, are actually seeking the connection with this All Pervading Power. This connection is called as Yoga the real Spiritual Yoga. It is not standing on your head or stretching your legs that it is a yoga. Even the taking the name of God, of praying to God, is not manifested unless and until you have the connection with this All Pervading Power of Divine Love. As this instrument when not connected with the mains, it has no meaning, it has no identity.In the same way, we the human beings, if we are not connected, to the All Pervading Divine Power, we have no meaning. We cannot have Self Knowledge, we cannot have the Enlightenment and we cannot know the Absolute Truth.

Most of the human problems are created problems of the world and most of the human problems come to us from these centers when they go into  jeopardy. All these subtle centers are within us.In the Bible it is mentioned that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames." In every scripture it is described the life, the Tree of Life. But nobody has tried to find out what is this.The civilization, in the West, has grown very much but it has to find out it's roots, roots of Spirituality otherwise this whole big civilization will be completely dissolved. As it is, you can see what's happening in the most developed countries like America. Thousands and thousands of people are suffering from AIDS, they are suffering from schizophrenia and the violence is at it's worst. You can't even wear a wedding ring and walk in the streets of New York. Such greed and such lust! No morality of any kind. It's not only there but you see it all over your world. At all developing countries, who have taken to this modern life, like Argentina also are in the same [UNCLEAR] but once we find our roots, once we find our identity, you understand how great you are. You understand why you were created, what is the purpose of your life, what is the goal of your life; Is only possible when you have your second birth. Many people brand them as twice born. Sorry, once more. As twice born,born twice but they are not  but they are not at all. Those, who call themselves as Muslims and Christians and Hindus, are not If they were real Christians, they would not have taken to this immoral life.How could such immoral life exist then in the name of Christ! Who said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes!" What subtle morality! What deep morality! That's only possible if you are enlightened. When the light comes within you, immediately you give up whatever is destructive, whatever is destructive within you and also you see what is outside is destructive.

Once you get your enlightenment, you can feel this All Pervading Power, for the first time, on your fingertips. You see also the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone. Is the actualization of your baptism. Then you start using this power and you can give realizations to others.

As a result of this, you get physical, mental, emotional, spiritual problems solved. I don't have to tell you, don't do this, don't do that, don't do that. With the light of the Spirit you yourself become your own guide, your own master, your own guru. You become extremely dynamic but extremely compassionate. You can feel your own centers on your fingertips.Then you see all religions belong to the same tree of life.All beautiful flowers of Divinity but people have taken out these flowers and now fighting with the dead flowers. And all these religions are one; They have the same business. There is no need at all to fight in the name of God.This you can know as a scientific proof after realization. You can feel on your fingertips the centers of others.Now if you know how to correct them, you can correct your centers as well as the of others. You develop a peaceful heart and tremendous compassion. You realize then how great your are all your virtues start manifesting. It is your own power it's your own. You all have it within you and you don't have to pay for it God doesn't understand banks. He doesn't understand money. It's a human [UNCLEAR]. By reading about it, you do not get to that point. You have to seek and you will find.

I call it a blossom time. Time when there are so many great souls are born. This is the fulfillment of the last judgment. The dead bodies are not going to come to life. I mean to say, all the prehistoric people and the dinosaurs all of them are going to come to life? But all those, who were dead, their souls will take birth as human beings. That's why we have a population problem. So many great souls, we have seen, born as children. I've seen children at the age of 6 and 10, can play on violin or on piano like a master. In India I've seen children below 10 years,

singing the Indian music, which is very difficult, like great masters of old times. Today only, I saw in the television, in France there were children  very small children playing on the violin in such a, in such a mastery. So these are the times, when all these great people are going to be born. There are some people, who are frightening to say that, this world is going to come to an end. Don't believe that. The One, who is our Creator, is our Father, is the Supreme Being of compassion. He has not created this world to be destroyed but He has made places, for all of you, in the Kingdom of God. Don't be eluded by people  some of them are coming even from India and trying to put conditionings in your heads.

The other day, I met somebody from this Hare Rama business. They are absolutely stupid, idiotic people. If you have to call the name of your Prime Minister here, near his house, you'll be arrested and you are calling the name of God without any protocol, without any permission, without any connection. You might only get cancer of throat. I don't know what other punishments.

I must say, Russians were very clever. They said, "We had no food Mother, so we had nice food from them and now they have gone away permanently. Mother, [UNCLEAR] I said that Russians were very clever and they said that, "These people had brought food so we ate the food nicely and now they have gone away completely." They have completely gone from Russia. Did you follow?

Translator: No.

I think, the IQ of Russian is very high. IQ.

They said, "Mother, we could make out they are idiotic, stupid things they were telling us." In you, Sahaja yoga is not meant for stupid, idiotic people. So, one has to understand and think, we talk of God and why all these horrible things are happening in the name of God. What's gone wrong? The mistake is that we are not yet connected. This is what we have to achieve the connection  which is sahaja  means spontaneous. Sahaja  'Saha' means with, 'ja' is born. What's the matter with this gentleman? you see, you are little bit disturbing because they all start watching him. Please make yourself comfortable. But he's going round, putting up, everybody looking at him; You see, the [UNCLEAR].

Alright! I don't know how to tell you. How the time has come for you to specially, to achieve this state through your evolutionary process, through this awakening of this Kundalini, the power in your triangular bone. This bone is called as Sacrum that means, the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone. Athena, itself, means Primordial Mother so, Greeks believed in all that. And now there's a big upsurge in Greece also to take to their ancient knowledge because they're so restless, so frustrated. So, time has come for you all also to have your Self Realisation. Of course, I cannot force it on you, I respect your freedom. Those, who want to have it, can have it but you must have a very ardent desire. Those, who do not want to have, please leave the hall, we'll be very happy.
