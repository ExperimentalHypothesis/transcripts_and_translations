Guests rooms we have here. These are guest rooms on the other side. This is for the care taker who is staying up there are also stores. Down below also there are stores.

Soon to be finished. And we have done. Hello “in hindi: isko kahan leke aa gaye aap. Arre bhai shalini aapka kya haal hai.” Meaning: how come you brought It here. Oh Shalini how are you. [INAUDIABLE] wont believe these are broken pieces of crockery. All of this I have put it. Because easy to hold them easy to cook/put there. And the whole house is a mess. This one here is the bedroom. Another one there two bathrooms. Three bedrooms and this one. And there’s a care taker’s upstairs. (Sahaja Yogi: How many bedrooms in [INAUDIABLE]). Can say 14 because 10 there 2 – 1 is mine 1 is my husbands [INAUDIABLE] . 10 , 3 here and 1 [INAUDIABLE] 4 ... 14, is a good number. Alright. Do you care to have some fruits. Here.You have.

You can take all this to the hall and you can all share it. Take this with you. Can you take . Alright. [INAUDIABLE]. So now you people go round and see the plains and don’t trouble me in the kitchen. Food wouldn’t be ready or else.[INAUDIABLE] (in hindi: yahan le aao sadiya. Kahan gaye)meaning: bring the sarees here. Where did he go). This is the speciality. I hope they are not very sound?. This time only you get it here. No where else. (Sahaja Yogi: very sweet). “in hindi: [INAUDIABLE] idhare le aao. Kal kyonki tumne Us din sasti mehngi bechi mehngi sasti bechi. Kuch to yahan laga deejiye. Dekhlete zara. Sadiyan Sadiyan)meaning: bring it here. Yesterday because that day u sold cheaper costly and costly cheaper. Bring some here. Show it. Sarees Sarees. [INAUDIABLE] you come and sit here. You will be tired. Let’s wait for some fruits to bring here. “in hindi: “sadiyan la rahe hai na“ meaning: you are bringing sarees naa. [INAUDIABLE] . “in hindi: aur logo ke liye bhi sharbat bana rahe hai“ meaning: for other preparing sharbat. Some are more expensive some are less expensive. They have come for the sale. For example the first one is expensive saree compared to this blue one. But it is for your judgement. They put prices according to the silk and the amount of work they have put it. You see. So with the double colour are more expensive. Single colour are less expensive. Any body can buy. Let any body buy. (Sahaja Yogi: 1800). “in hindi: 1800 lagaya iska. baapre“ meaning: 1800 rupees you have charged. Oh my god. I think one should wear in the weddings. Otherwise you see somebody will have a open head, some body . This is of 50 pounds. 50 punds?. This is how much. (Sahaja Yogi: 600 rs.). sorry not 50 pounds. How much it is. (Sahaja Yogi: 20 pounds). I think its very cheap for 20 pounds. This is, this has to be compulsorily worn by brides. This has to be worn. Because otherwise we will have complications. (Sahaja Yogi: Every bride has to wear one of these ). And cost is 600 rupees. (Sahaja Yogi: cost is 600 rupees only),. And those who cannot afford I will give them free . Then I will pay. Its just a solution. You see because if supposing if you don’t have say , if you have saree tied up like that then you cannot make them wear mangalsutra. But this is much easier. And not much price. Now bring that. Now these I had shown you before. Some people ordered some did not. So you have a choice here of these. This is all in pure silver. Gold plated. But the pearly are [INAUDIABLE]. They are not also unreal. They are something in between. So I don’t know what to say. But all this is for “in Marathi: kiti rupay lavle ho” meaning: how much rupees its costing. (Sahaja Yogi: 750). 750. So those who wants to buy as presents or for the bride an anything then they can buy this. The rest of it will be giving. 750 rupees . so for this you can come to Mr. Bikule. Those who want to buy. Also some men wants to buy as presents or anything can come. First chance should be to the bride. Those who wan to buy come along. What about you. She is marrying fill ward?. come along. Fill ward is a rich man you see. You can bring him everything. You can bring him everything otherwise he will be very unhappy if you don’t buy a good saree. He will pay for you. Come along all the girls. I need not call one by one. Come along those who want to buy. Those who want to buy this. The price is gone up. I am sorry. But everything has gone up. We can’t help it. This is just at the cost price. Can you come from the side. Hello. You can move on the sides and come back. Now for the saree. Those who have bought the sarees to those who are marrying. For getting married. Those who have not bought the sarees yet please raise your hands. (Sahaja Yogi: those who have not bought the saree yet and they are getting married please raise your hand). The boys. You better choose. And the girls, have you chosen. Who is there. Merlin come on. Come along. Come along. She is a Indian lady naa. [INAUDIABLE] 1600 rupees. Alright. This is nice one. And now those who are buying sarees and now those who have bought the sarees I have told you we cant make any blouses in Ganapatipule. So all of you will have to give your saree and all the boys who want to buy their kurta pajamas have to give their measurements for silk. Otherwise you will not have there. Its not possible. It’s a village we are going to. Tell in your language. In French, I think somebody ha [INAUDIABLE] in French. Alright. You want to buy saree. (Sahaja Yogi: speaking in French). And those who are not getting married also can buy. No problem. But only thing is that you have to give your sarees back to these people or you can take out the, there are scissors you can take out the blouse piece and give it. (Sahaja Yogi: speaking in French). Whats this language. (Sahaja Yogi: they are French). That’s Italian speaking French. Worst is when English speak French. We think they are speaking in Marathi. English have to speak the French. “in hindi: tumko lena hai na” meaning: you want to buy isn’t it. (Sahaja Yogi: speaking in French) “in hindi: accha accha. Kaunsi wali. [INAUDIABLE] wahan ke logo ko. Kitna shauk hai mai nahee keh sakti. Lekin. Wo dekhiye. Ye jo bharee huee hai. Aur ek wo blue wali. Ye apne yahan ke logon ko pasand ayegi.” Meaning: ok ok. Which one. [INAUDIABLE] for those people. How much they like I cant say. But. See that. This which is filled with design. And that one the blue one. This people here will like it. What is there to say. I mean you do. She will be shocked and she will be very unhappy you say such a thing. Or if you say you are very beautiful she will be shocked you know. So it’s a different style. Should be wise man. I don’t force. [INAUDIABLE]. Colombia has said/sent that about. That’s why. The first one. (Sahaja Yogi: mother, just a [INAUDIABLE]. We have organized to pray [INAUDIABLE] in Brazil and now there is a [INAUDIABLE] little group. But [INAUDIABLE] to come back to Italy because she says for Brazil is not the time now. Not ready for sahaja yoga. And) what was the response. (Sahaja Yogi: well all the seekers were came to a program. they have done all black magic or spiritism all). Makes no difference. (Sahaja Yogi: ok). Put their left hand towards the photograph and right hand on mother earth. Because I have to come to brazil next year. Better be there I think. [clapping] ??all black magic. But when I went there, there were so many people that even outside the hall I just couldn’t walk through the garden. So crowded. Till I reach to the dias. I don’t know how. So crowded from everywhere. [INAUDIABLE]. I just don’t know . Because afterall they had never seen me before. I don’t know if they have heard also about me. But there were just a photograph , what you call the, posters whatever it is. Imagine so many people get. Same thing will happen in Brazil. And if they had been more to the black magic they understand me better. You see they understand me better as power. Actually in the beginning I never talked about my sel f “I am Adi-shakti or anything”. But what has happened really was that one lady came who was possessed and she started describing me. And she sang praise of me in a manly voice from a chapter of the Saundarya-Lahari. And a ordinary maid servant she was. That really shocked everyone. She didn’t know who she is. But she just couldn’t stand before me and she was shaking and. Then only I started saying yes. Otherwise I didn’t want to say. I said why say you are Adi-shakti or anything. Unnecessary problems. But had to. Unless and until you accept me as Adi-shakti vibrations do not work out. That’s one thing. That’s the compulsion I think. If somebody doesn’t accept doesn’t want to understand it then vibrations cannot work out. This is the big problem. And this is the only problem I face with all the scientists, all the intellectuals, all other people. While all other gurus what they do, they say that we will tr y to help you this thing. But no body say that I am the God the real sense. Some of people say but they have proved to be not to be God. So to accept the situation without my photograph you cannot cleanse yourself. without my photograph you cannot get vibrations. without my photograph you should not give realization. So every where the photograph has to be used, my name has to be there, my face has to be there. And this is such a compulsion I don’t know , its very embarrassing. But it is so. you see all other incarnations never wanted to face any embarrassment. Its only my luck. [INAUDIABLE] also have to tell you sometimes if somebody is sitting with their feet towards me or something, oh no please sit properly. You don’t sit before me like this. Not proper. You not to take advantage. Like I have to tell them. Its very embarrassing to tell somebody that you better respect me. One has to do it. You cant help it. So now I am going back to cooking and I hope you get in time. Alright . where is that [INAUDIABLE]. better come and see me there.
