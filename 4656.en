“The Power of Brahma”, Public Program, Delhi (India), 11 March 1981.

I have told you, the other day that these vibrations are nothing but the Brahma Shakti, the power of Brahma. The power of Brahma is the power that creates, that desires, that evolves and it gives the living force also. It is the power which is giving us the living force. It is the living force and it is not easy to understand what is a dead force and what is a living force. Living force is very simple to understand. An animal, say a little worm, is a living force. It can turn itself the way it likes. It can save itself from danger. It may be a small little thing, but because it is living it can save itself. But something which is dead cannot move by itself. So, the “Self” part does not remain in it, as far as it is concerned.

Now, being a living force we should try to find out, “Are we going to be the living force or the dead one”. Now, when we live in the world, we start thinking about our comforts; where we have to live, what we have to do. When we think of all these things, you see, we are thinking of the dead. But when we think of having a place or a house or an Ashram from the angle that you Will be doing some living work, then you are giving life to that place. That atmosphere should be created from all that is dead-to create the living force.

Now, this is very, very subtle thing, which very few people understand, for example, somebody brings me a photograph of Shri Ganesh and says, “Should I worship this Shri Ganesh’s photograph or not”. First of all, we should see if vibrations are coming from it or not. Supposing you take a house You must see that the house is giving good vibrations. We see the comfort; we see other things. We might even see if it is good for other people to come in or not, but we do not see the house from vibrations point of view. For anything that we do, we have, now, to think in terms of vibratory awareness which means awareness that is working upon living things. As in the, say, a cell at the tip of the root of a tree is a living thing. Of course, it does not think, it is guided by the living force itself. So, it knows how to move with the living force, to live with it and how to understand the plan of the living force to get along with it and how to merge with it.

But, we human beings have got the freedom to decide. Now, once you are realized, you have got that living force within you. This is the living force as you get. So, you have to know how to use this living force to keep your this body, mind, ego, superego and everything in  an enlightened state, by understanding the planning of the living force.

It gives you all the ideas as to most of the problems. For example, here in this country and specially in Delhi, I find that you catch on the left Nabhi, catch on the right Swadishthana and then you catch on the Heart and also on your Agnya. These are the four Chakras which deal with our being. So, let us try from the left side. What happens? On the left side the problem starts from left swadhishthna, because that is the first Chakra that starts emitting the negativity within us. Now, this left  Swadhisthana catches, you start going to other people who promise you such things, like “I will give you this and that, this will happen, that will happen to you”. But this left sided thing can also come from your own desire for wrong things. For example, we might be desiring something very wrong; we might be thinking that let us have this kind of a dead thing or that kind of dead thing or some sort of a special thing. Suppose, somebody wants a refrigerator and keeps on thinking of it. He thinks that he must have a fridge. He must go to the fridge, because he wants a fringe, and he must get it. Why he wants a fridge ?is actually under control only of Shri Ganesh because Shri Ganesh is the beginning of life and Ganesh is the link between the life and the death. So Ganesh is one who gives the balance, the “Vivek” the understanding to you by which you know how far to go with the things. Now, left  Swadhishthana catches, you start going to other people who promise you such things, like “I will give you this and that, this will happen, that will happen to you”. But this left sided thing can come from our own desire for wrong things. For example, we might be desiring something very wrong; we might be thinking that let us have this kind of a dead thing or that kind of dead thing or some sort of a special thing, he wants to keep, he wants to keep, he wants to keep. He must go to the fridge, because he wants a  fridge and he must get it. Why he wants a fridge? Because he thinks it will give him more comfort. But, when he brings the fridge, he knows that it is not so. So, the best way to look at all dead things is not to go too far with them. If you have, well and good. If you do not have, well and good. You can live with minimum of minimum or you can live with maximum of maximum of these. But when we start expanding our dead possessions, it is very much bad. Then our attention goes into the dead. That’s how we move into our subconscious then over to collective subconscious. Then it moves higher  at the left Nabhi, and at left Nabhi, we start becoming crazy about these dead things. For example, the watch, the Time. Time is a dead thing; it is not a living things. It has nothing to do with living thing. For example, you cannot say exactly at what time the flower will become a fruit. So this watch or time has nothing to do with the living force at all. It is human or man-made like the watch; particularly time is also man made. For example, today, time here is something, but in England it is different. If you say it is 4-0′ clock in India, it is the same  at England,. is not correct. So, the timing is not important. What time you arrive what time you go, how many times you do it, is not ‘important.

Because  it is a living force ; it has no time limit or space limit, you cannot count it, the way it moves, the way it works out. Because it is a living force. Once we understand this it is a living force which is spontaneous, which is not bothered about our dead ideas, we have come out of dead. We were first stones, then we became amoebae, then we. gradually became human beings. So, our attention is all the time towards the dead. What should we get, what should we have, what is the needs we have of this body which is going to die.

We do not see to the needs of the Spirit. By seeing to the needs of the spirit, only you can overcome the left side. You want start looking after your spirit from which you know that you get your vibrations. If your Spirit is happy, you get your vibrations, if it is unhappy, you do not get the vibrations. Such a common thing! If you have any disease on the left hand side or a problem on left hand side, to give it a balance, you put your attention to the future. But then people get stuck up on the future. You see if I say you look to the future. As dead is dead and is ‘Mithya’ (illusion), in the is not living in the same way future is also not giving, which which is also not there. So both the things are just the same. Whether you go to left or right, whether you go to the subconscious or the supra conscious mind, both the thing are just the same. So, no use going to the past, but if you are too much in the past, it is better to think of the future, so that you are pushed a little bit to the  contrary state. But, it is
difficult for you, human beings.

Now, the other problem starts within,  then  we start feeling guilty,  then left Vishuddhi catches. Left Vishuddhi catches because  we start feeling guilty about whatever we are and that, which should be said that “I should have not done this  or I should not have done that”. Then you start saying, “] am very miserable, miserable and I am myself very guilty”  and further you  don’t ask for [INAUDIBLE]. This is another nonsense. That is how once you start doing that, condemn. No, it will Never. It goes on progressing itself. It sees, which side to move, this side or that side. It is not going to condemn itself. It is not going to aggress anything. It has that  wisdom to be in the Centre . That is how people should over-come their left side, by putting their attention away from the dead things.  Must watch from the Centre, when you are on the left side. What you want to see, you don’t see. But then ultimately to escape  all this, what you do is to start blaming yourself all the time and feeling miserable. But  this is the way you start ending up with your left side into a very miserable state, that is the culmination of all these attachments to the left side. So, ultimately you start thinking that you are good for nothing, you are useless, you should have done this, you should have done that.

Now, at this time to overcome it, you have to count your blessings. Count your Blessings one by one. You have got your realization. During thousands of years how many people have got realization? You have got your vibrations. In so many centuries, how many people have got them? It is written in  Jain system that there were altogether 26 Kashyaps (Realized Souls). So, even after Buddha, how many got their realization? You must  thank God also that there are so many realized people,  they talk the same And  you must thank yourself also, that everything can be known to you.

But, when you start catching on the left, you go to  the past and [INAUDIBLE: you think] and you start saying, “Oh God ? I am so useless; I am good for nothing. I am  useless, that I am still catching”. As you know, ‘the left hand side, those who catch are always complaining, always grudging type because of poor things, they suffer. Now, to match with that  the other side, so , if I tell you that you go to the other side also, it is a very very dangerous game. For example, we have so many conditionings in our lives. You see, first of all reaching that our desire to become excellent Sahaja Yogis, to become Master Gurus and something great and this and that; That there should be many disciples that we should have, they  should touch our feet and we should be called Great Gurus etc.

So, in Sahaja Yoga there are things that are prohibited that no Sahaja Yogi should touch anybody’s feet and no Sahaja Yogi should allow anyone to touch  their feet. This is one of the great Bandhans for all Sahaja Yogis that nobody should touch each other’s feet and  nor anybody should touch your feet, whatever may be your quality, whatever you may be. Those who will touch will lose vibrations, and those who will get salutations will also catch; they will catch on the heart. So, such conditions,  in fact we have about Sahaja Yoga also, should be removed.

We are all of us growing together. We are part and parcel of one personality. All are equal, Nobody is higher or lower. The one who thinks the slightest like this will go down faster. This is the left side conditioning, where people falter very much. So, such desires must be given up in Sahaja Yoga.

You -,must have very wider desires in Sahaja Yoga that all of us must get realization-say as many as possible. We should try to save as many people as possible. We should try to improve ourselves as far as we can, and we are nothing yet; But we can improve and  both the points if you put it all the time, then it will work out. Like when you feel rejected, feel you should say, no, how can that be? Mostly with left-sided people are extremely, really rejected.

Now, the thoughts can come from the left side also. Now that you come to the right side; Like, if you have some Bhoots in your head, they can give you the thought that, “Oh, you are useless or good for nothing.” Now, raise your right side and put down the left.  Now why do we do it  ? Because  right side is the giver side and due to that here you get the  grace and put down the left side. Such people who suffer from the left side should try this. One more thing is, that first ideas come to you or such thoughts that you are good for nothing  and all that, it is better to beat yourself with shoes. Go and sing the praise of the Lord and say that I am so happy. I have got everything around me. So you got everything.

Now, the second thing is about the right side. On the right side, mostly you catch on the Swadishthan; that is because you think. This is another kind of thinking  which gives you catch at right Swadishthan. At this we think
whether it comes from right or the left will give first problem for your liver. The worst comes when both the sides are involved. There are some Bhoots which give you ideas that,”You  are good for nothing, this and that and thenyou start thinking that you are so great. In this such a wobbling starts coming and the confusion starts setting in.

So, one must understand that in Sahaja Yoga, you are to develop that sharp edge, that central point from which you do not deviate to the right or to the left. This is something so subtle that you are left sided, you are not going to remain left sided. You can become right-sided tomorrow. Exactly, tomorrow you can come with a right-sided problem. So, you must learn that balancing, just like you start learning a bicycle. You might fall on this side or that side.

Now, when do you learn cycling? If  somebody ask me, I will say, “When you learn.” I mean when you cycle down, that’s the point when you learn. So, in Sahaja Yoga, to balance it, you have to watch yourself carefully. Now, where does it  go to the left side, alright then come to the right . If going to the right side, come to the left side. Now, come to the Centre, you just separate yourself, you detach yourself all the time, nor to criticize yourself  neither to aggress anybody else or to criticize others. But use this point just to see yourself, just to see and guide yourself. Guidance is very different from getting lost. Now that is what it is.

When a dead thing is lost, supposing a dead thing is here; supposing this is a dead thing, I throw it, it will fall at the point where I throw it. But there's a living thing if I throw it, it does not fall [INAUDIBLE]So, the living force knows how to guide itself. In the same way you will learn to guide yourself., If you have learnt it, you have mastered Sahaja Yoga.

No use condemning yourself, in any way or thinking that you are great or small. But watch now, where the horse is going. You are sitting on the top of the horse; now you are no more the horse. Before, Realization you are the horse. Wherever it takes you, you go there. It may stand there, when it sees the grass and eat. Then the horse wants to kick somebody, it will do so, But, now, you have come out of the horse and sitting on the horse as a Rider. Now you are the Rider and you must know how you are befouled by these things. These desires are all ancient age old things within you. See, also the aggression, the Karma that you are doing are also ancient. By doing this you will get this, you will get that. Many people will say, “Mother, we are doing this, we are doing so much for Sahaja Yoga; we have still not achieved anything”. Now, what to do. Just can’t help it. Now, you must find out, what is the matter with you.

Now, if the Heart is catching, such people can never progress. The Heart is the source of Light; it is the source of Brahma Shakti. Heart is the seat of Atma. If in the Heart there is no living force, then how can you progress?

The first thing you have to know, many people have different types of powers, I would say. Some people are guided, if somebody tells them, you can follow them. That's it.

If there are some people who tell them everything, so they're wrong. You don't listen. That's how it is.

You must know what to choose. This is what Sahaja Yoga should make of you. You should grow, mature to that point where you should know what to do.

This is the goal. Then you don't ask for that. Don't Sahaja Yoga.

You just see yourself as the blind one. Please tell your friend first time, that what I'm doing. I should know what I'm doing.

I should know what is correct. I should know how to do it. I should know.

I is not the state, cannot be. No more ego exists or superego exists, but it is the spirit which exists. And you find something, you realize, children? They are so much there.

They don't have such questions. They know who is a foolish person, who is stupid, who talks foolishly. They know who is caught up.

They know from whom to start up, whom to argue. They know you. They are not there.

They do not sympathize with people who are caught up. No. They just watch.

If somebody comes, they be telling, what has he, this fellow is caught up. That's it. If somebody comes, let him, he's all right.

That's all. They just have to come. They do not hate anyone.

They do not get worried about anything. They just sit. If somebody comes with a very bad aura, we say, let him go away.

He better get all right. That's all. Without any malice about the person.

Once you are on top of the hill, then you don't have to worry about the traffic. But you are not at the top. That's why you are worried.

And you think that I'm climbing and falling from here. But this whole thing is just a mental shadow. It's a thought.

You are on top of the hill. But you are not assented. Ascension is not.

You must know what to choose. This is what Sahaja Yoga should make out of you. You should grow mature to that point where you know what to choose. This is Growth. Then you don’t ask of Mother. You don’t ask anyone.

This development should come to you. That, “what I do, I should know what I am doing. I should know what is correct. I should know how to correct it’. I should know ‘1’, here is the Spirit and not the Ego. No more the Ego exists or the Super-ego exist. It is the Spirit which guides you. You see the Realized children. They don’t ask such questions. They know who is foolish, who is stupid. They know who is caught up. They know whom to shut up and whom to argue. They do not sympathize with the people, who are caught up. They just watch. If somebody comes, they will tell me, “Mataji, this fellow is caught”. That’s all. Somebody else comes. They promptly tell me, “He is alright”. That’s all. They just certify. They do not hate anyone; they do not get worried about anything. If somebody comes with a very bad Badha, they say, “Better please, go away”, without any malice about the person.

Once, you are at the top of the hill, you have not to worry about the traffic. But, you are not yet on the top, that’s why you are worried that, “I am climbing and falling, climbing and failing”. This is just a Myth, just a mental shadow on your mind. This is a fact that you are at the top of the hill. But you have not asserted, the assertion is not there.

The God is the enjoyer. You cannot enjoy. You can only enjoy God, and it is the greatest enjoyment, to feels what God has created for you, what a beautiful life He has given you in human awareness, by which you can know how much He has loved you, how much He has worked for you. He has brought you to this level. What He has given you, you can give to others and make others happy. If you think like that immediately both of your sides will be settled and you yourself will be filled with Divine Vibrations.

[Hindi to English translation]

You must be seated! Be seated! You've been seated on the throne. Sitting on the throne, you're begging. Without the throne, everyone is crying. Sitting on the throne, everyone is acting mad. What to do? Arrey Bhai, sit on the throne! You are a king, sit down. And give orders to your five fingers.

Sir! Now sit down, come on, that’s enough. Now this is fine, now that is fine; you've understood all that very well now. When you are able to command yourself in this way, when you are able to control yourself completely, only then—are you a true Sahaja Yogi.

Otherwise you will say, while sitting, just like others say, “What can I do, Mataji, I try so hard to control my mind, but it goes inward again.” Then what is the mind? The mind is a living force, it will go. Let it go, it’s a living force, it will go only to the place where it’s meant to go.

It is all necessary to awaken our qualities, and when they are awakened—we will keep dropping many things, keep letting go. Let them go; it won’t happen without letting go. And in all these things, you need to keep only one thing in mind: that our heart should be pure, should be pure. Those who have a pure heart face fewer problems.

It means your impurities should be cleansed. Purity means surrender. If there is a lack of surrender in Sahaja Yoga, or if one thinks “I am special,” then that person will have flaws. No education is needed for that; no special people are needed for that. If it didn’t happen to me, if I didn’t feel any experience—does it mean the fault is with you or with Sahaja Yoga?

People sometimes talk to me in such a way, as if I had taken a contract for it. They say, “You did nothing for us. I’ve gone mad. My mother! We’ve been coming to you for twenty-five years.” Still the same twenty-five, twenty-five. But nothing is going to happen to you, what can I do? So if it’s not happening, then it means something is wrong within you.

But as soon as you detach yourself, you will begin to see your own faults. And as soon as you see them—Rajesh, look here, he is like a king. He is seated on the throne, and he notices that some of his subjects are misbehaving. “Stay quiet!” — It’s not going to work like that. Not like that — do this, do that. A person should know how to fully handle himself. Certainly. They are powerful. So you’ll have to speak with them.

That will be the nature. Even a small matter can be settled through conversation. We want to talk to you, we observe. They’re not even aware of whom they are speaking with; and if they do, they do in such a manner, it’s quite astonishing. There’s no more an understanding of what we should say, and what we shouldn’t.

We should have control over our tongue; that control will only come when you observe detached from self: “Is this tongue behaving properly?” This also — people just don’t do. If I have to do it, then what should I do? It’s a new style, and then — whom are you giving orders to?

Come on now, go on as usual. A person who is realized is always cheerful, always joyful. Come on, you have to go. Come on now, sit over there. Even the children say [unclear] “Now this Nirmala is not going to leave, she’s sitting here now.” They speak in the Third Person.

Sahaja Yogis should also speak in this way. Gradually, one should detach oneself from self. The desires we have, the ideas we have — the remaining desires or any other ideas we carry, how long will you keep saying, “I should do this, I should do that.” Let go of all that, and think: What should I do for Sahaja Yoga? What should we do for Sahaja Yoga?

Even now in India, this thing is very little, but abroad it is very much. Those people never come and say to me that “My father's grandfather's cousin brother is not getting cured.” Mother, please cure him. That’s too much. So never about their material things—not even once have they said it. Never, or nothing — this is a materialistic problem or something — never. They appear to be worry-free.

Although...

Look into their eyes, such concentration; even if someone speaks a single word in Hindi, they will listen with full attention. Nothing can be heard, oh! How are vibrations emitting from them, how are the vibrations coming into the hands? Which vibrations need to be corrected, what is the problem?

[Unclear] Look, they gave their whole life to Sahaja Yoga; and—they can't give anything else. Alright then, we’ll do this too, we’ll do that too. Only by giving your whole life to Sahaja Yoga you truly grow. This is also something I have to tell you. You have nothing to lose in this. You don’t fall short of anything.

Your whole life should be given to Sahaja Yoga; every single moment should be given for Sahaja Yoga. The meaning of Sahaj is to act spontaneously; spontaneous—anytime, in any way. Sahaja Yoga is a living, blissful power. And then you won’t even need to think [Unclear].

Because you people still cannot enjoy; the one who truly enjoys is only the Paramatma. You cannot enjoy anything. You are under the illusion that you are enjoying something; you simply cannot enjoy. The enjoyer is also Paramatma, and He is the Creator, and He is [Unclear: “the creation too”]. You—You are just like a ‘wipe’ in between, that’s how you are, so just observe—

And if you do not do anything, if you do one thing, then Paramatma has immense love for you. But this is the only act you can do — to remain completely in bliss. Completely — otherwise, you cannot clearly visualise anything else. Because the one who enjoys anything is only Him.

That’s the thing — today you got one thing, then tomorrow you got another, then a third, even then no satisfaction. We should speak to God, only the one who enjoys everything must always enjoy it. Why do we, or you, need to enjoy anything?

Only that’s the joy that He created the entire creation — such a beautiful world, so many things have been given to us, and now you’ve become Sahaja Yogis. Within us, we can know God, we can recognize ourselves. We can recognize the spirit in others; because if the grace of God is upon us — just thinking and thinking of this, even that becomes possible.

When you begin to enjoy God this way, then you will see that your hand gives you realization. [Unclear: In the entire creation you... ... ...]

This is my message to you today. Start connecting with God, forget all other enjoyments and begin to enjoy just God, and if you enjoy Him, then what more would you need from God? What more do you need? What more do you need? You will be able to enjoy that. You will see—You will see your life will be completely transformed.

After coming into Sahaja Yoga, every moment we should be thinking—What have we received? What have we received? We have received so much, so much, so much; we keep saying so. Come on. First of all, your complaints will never end. And you keep searching for vibrations.

Now if you have any questions, then ask.

[Seeker asks some question]

Shri Mataji: I told them that what is the enjoy. [inaudible] You can only enjoy God, and that is the greatest thing you have ever seen, what God has created for you. He has given you human awareness by which you can know how much He has done, how much He has worked for you, how much He has brought you to this level, what He has given you—you can give to others, you can make others happy. If you take like that, immediately you will know the science. Sit. Left heart to right, why left heart is catching? Because God doesn't have time, thank Him!

Sahaja Yogi: Maa! Why there is question of depression without being guilt?

Shri Mataji: Without being...?

Sahaja Yogi: Guilty.

Shri Mataji: You see, first he asked me the question, "Why there is depression without being guilty?" If one gets possessed, you feel to get possessed, but somehow you never reach poise—who talk of separation. You need some quarantine; you allow brothers to attend in Sahaja Yoga. Don’t you listen to Sahaja Yoga with great interest? [Unclear] Then whom do you listen to?

[Unclear: "Some conversation with Sahaja Yogis"]

[Unclear: "Some conversation with Sahaja Yogis"]

Very surprising, because in the Granth Sahib all about the realized souls’ [Unclear: is written]. Here, sorrow is definitely there. There is no doubt about this; depression must certainly happen here. That's why like fools they keep reading them, do nothing. [Unclear] Even in Gurudwaras, in the Granth Sahib, there’s nothing that isn’t specially found in Nanak Sahib. But he included all the realized souls—what Kabir, all, whoever he found. Be it Kabir or Nagdev, whoever they were—he compiled the Granth Sahib with all the realized souls. But those who read it must themselves be depressive—what can be done about that? All those whose minds are messed up—God save! Because... [Unclear] And secondly, it's a place where they don’t know about realized souls, nothing—they read like fools. Nanak Sahib said everything—he said, search what is inside; search! They're just reading “search, search, search.” [Unclear] This will definitely lead to depression if you mix up with such people. If you dwell with such people, you won’t ascend. Having attained it, by staying with such people—joy.

Understood, right?

What are you asking? [Unclear conversation] Alright, ask! ‘Bhai’, ask![Unclear] Why, where are you going?

Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Matajii: 'Aanh'
Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Are you here?
Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: You go.You want to come to staff.
Seeker: Staff! [inaudible] ... ... You can come home.
Shri Mataji: Are you here?
Seeker: [Inaudible.]
Shri Mataji: Yes, I will come home.
Seeker: 'Aanh!'
I'll come little late after the staff.

Seeker: I will bring you home.

Shri Matajii: 'Aanh!'

Seeker: I will bring you home.

Other Seeker: [Inaudible]

Brahma Ji, Brahma Ji!

[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: Everyone will meet in the morning.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji, we will come after having food!

Shri Mataji: Alright.

This, which is more from our left side—[unclear]—you understood, right? Put the left side inward, and the right side outward.

At night, you should not roam around too much. Another thing is, like listening to the stories of dead souls—This should not be done. [Unclear...] Look deep within—it’s very good. Things that are meant to frighten, etc., are very powerful—you should avoid them. It’s very surprising—in this, the whole scene is seen by realized souls, and how possession happens is written in it, what depression is like, what it does. What happens is—depression also comes from this—that the person becomes possessed. This is the worst of all. For that we have ['inaudible...'] in Sahaja Yoga, not 'outside Sahaja.' For that, there is [unclear] in Sahaja Yoga—not something outside Sahaja Yoga.

So, keep your left hand on your left side and your right hand outward in this manner. Everything is written down, so you should come to the centre; because so that, you are [unclear] in correction mode—what is written in Sahaja Yoga—[unclear]. It has to be done every day, washing of the feet has to be done every day; It is just a, more important than just bathing. It is much much more important, as well as is asnana, is a bath, every day you have to do it.

[Unclear conversation]

Shri Mataji: Alright!

Sahaja Yogi: Mother! I just want to ask one thing.

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogi: I want to ask you a question.

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogi: Whether different asanas (postures) for different chakras can be beneficial for Sahaja Yogis, I mean, can it be helpful if different...

Shri Mataji: Yes, they should do it.

Sahaja Yogi: Then please suggest asanas for different chakras.

Shri Mataji: Look, Sahaja Yoga is something that comes from inside to outside, not outside to inside. Understand?

Sahaja Yogi: Okay!

Shri Mataji: First, correct your chakras, then come to your mind. First observe your mind; until you've corrected your chakras physically, that won’t be resolved. So then think about what is living! What rises from within—from this alone, all the power spreads in all directions. Now, what’s the use if you’ve only made your outer surroundings good, and inside, if [unclear: some worm rises, then how will the worm...]? That’s why I don’t profess asanas much. If the asanas are everything, then everyone will just sit doing it; I’ve seen that if I tell someone one asana, they keep doing only that—oh! I said, your [unclear: thing is now cured], then why are you still doing it? That’s why I don’t emphasize asanas too much. Actually, inside us is a tendency that we must do something. If I say, “Stand on your head every day,” then better than breaking your head, just stand firmly on the truth. Somehow, the man must have to do some such thing. If there’s nothing else, then go hang from the fan. We can’t even sit peacefully for five minutes—this is the misery. Now if I start teaching asanas, then in a few days, you’ll see everyone doing gymnastics in front of me. So, it’s better, ‘Baba’! just meditate. We don’t need any asanas. So, if we say what happens just by doing asanas, otherwise I’ve seen people—when I told them about Bahastrika, their attention breaks. I saw people [unclear: while meditating], I said, "’Bhai’, is this meditation or something else going on?" If at all something is there, then it's the attention. [unclear]—so it is all what is happening here?

Even bandhan, giving bandhan also has its own charm when you sit in meditation. So that you can keep your mind set. These are all external—bandhan; You are saying, you people on their way. [Unclear] First fix your mind; if you're complaining, then your mind needs to be set right. If you’re aggressive, your mind needs to be corrected. Correct the mind first—the mind comes first. Everything arises from the mind—get control over the mind. If your hand or foot is actually broken, then that you can get treated. But now even that can be healed by Kundalini. That’s why asanas shouldn’t be given too much focus—first attention on God, first attain God, letting go the power of God, don’t you find it strange, all this obsession with asanas? Doesn't it seem strange?

Like one gentleman, he said his plane got missed. [Unclear] Now he came and slept in our drawing room. He said, “I’m a great yogi.” I said, “Alright, now what?” He said, “I sleep on a hard cot.” I said, “We don’t have a cot here. This is a ‘Deevan’—you can sleep on it, sleep comfortably.” He said, “I don’t sleep on just anything.” So I said, “Then sleep on the floor, do whatever you like.” He said, “Wake me up at four o'clock.” We said, “Brother, we’ll wake you up. My wife wakes up at four, she’ll wake you too—now go to sleep.” Now if you create a nuisance for others, [unclear] You go to someone’s house—[Unclear] What happened? He saw it was already five o’clock! I said, “What happened?” Sahab said that as soon as he went inside, he saw him lying like this! [Unclear] “What should I do now?” I said, “Let it go—Good thing you didn’t ask...” [Unclear] [Inaudible]

He said, “So then what should be done? What’s the treatment for this?” I said, “Just keep doing this—what else?” He said, “I even tried leaving it like this and saw...” So just sitting, sitting, sitting like this [unclear], it doesn't make sense—there's something else going on.

Even before, the same [unclear] [Unclear] There shouldn’t be such a thing that someone else sees and [unclear] [Unclear: such a spectacle], there is no need for all this drama [. unclear] Like in Sahaja Yoga, Kundalini rises up [unclear] Now look, one gentleman used to do asanas, it took twenty years to wean him off them. Whenever he came to the program, his acrobatics would begin. If you told him to raise his hands, he would lift his legs instead. [Inaudible] Sahaja Yoga is a magnificent thing. Why have you gone searching for all this? [Unclear] There is no need for any asanas. Understand which of your chakras are caught.

Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: [Hain] What!

Sahaja Yogi: How will sleep come, Shri Mataji! [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: [Hain] What! [Unclear] Suppose sleep comes, [unclear] it is the tendency of the mind. [Hindi phrase means] Once one gets detached with the mind, the wish of the mind gets fulfilled. It’s the mind, the mind that is seated there. You went looking here and there, do this, do that— ‘Bhai’ what for, why are you doing this? Enjoy peacefully. I already said that you have to experience the fire of the Divine, and [audio break] When a person is like this, asked him about the lecture, there is no attention—then it’s not all right. I was even getting done something in the early stages but they were not accepting it.

Otherwise, silently take the breath down, bring it up.

Until something disastrous doesn’t happen to them.

Please come in, be seated!

This is like a feast—understand that you’re at a feast. And if someone starts doing asanas at a feast, what will people say? It’s for enjoyment—you enjoy it. Why are you creating chaos for no reason? This thing doesn’t make sense that creating chaos. Whoever understands this point, they will get realization. He couldn’t do anything, he read the entire Ramayana, read the Bhagavata too. He didn’t leave anything, did every odd thing—you did everything! What in this life, what in the previous life, what in the life before that? Now, when the time has come to reap the fruit—so why are you doing asanas? You’re offering someone fruit to eat, and they...

Yogi: Shri Mataji, should one bathe before sitting for meditation in the morning?

Shri Mataji: Not necessary. It’s not necessary to bathe—if your body’s condition is fine, then just sit. If it’s not fine, then do bathe. Bathing and washing is all—cleanse the mind. First and foremost, the mind should be clean. A person who is cleansing the mind—before that, even that dirt...Once, said something and caught a cold. I said, "You take a bath”; I said, "Alright then take three names”. He didn’t believe. As soon as he took the three names, no bad smell in the nose or body. Why bathe? Three days without bathing. You people don’t bathe?

Sahaj Yogi: Some people don’t bathe for a whole month there, and still they don’t have any problem.

Shri Mataji: Hmm!

Sahaj Yogi: Those people also...

Shri Mataji: Those people are not at all clean. People should bathe daily. Those who should bathe, are exactly those people. And like us...meaning bathing and washing is not at all necessary. This all...I am telling about extreme cases. But such people must bathe daily, extreme...Very dirty, extremely dirty. Ask them. They don’t even think they’re dirty, they think they’re clean. If they have to get vibrations, they will; if we don’t, then fine. They are very dirty people. They smell a lot. I make them wash their hands six times. They go to the bathroom and don’t even wash their hands afterward. Such filthy people they are!

These people are all... Did a lot for these people; As for us...in collectivity, if there's household dirt, throw it in the trash. Outwardly it should be clean. They themselves will bathe, but their children...It’s very cold there, and they have it a lot. They’ll keep the outside cleaner than the inside. Whatever the thing is... it’s dirty. Bathing and washing does give some freshness to the body. But it's not necessary that if you haven’t bathed, you can't meditate. This is what I keep saying...When you practise this, if you bathe, fine; If you skip one day, what’s the big deal? Nothing is above you. Everything is below you. If you bathe, it’s good.

Did you hear their story?
