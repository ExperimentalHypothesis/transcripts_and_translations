 (England)
Another time, she also called us. Yes, we were living in Chelsham Road. We were married, I had Fatima, and one day we got a phone call. I think it was Warren, from another house, and he phoned saying, "Okay, could you come? Mother needs some people."

Again, I tried to find other people, but I couldn't find anyone, so I had to go. On the way, I found Dania. "Yes, me too," she said. I said, "I got called. Do you know why?" "No." "Mother wants to see us." We didn't know why.

So we arrived there. She was in her big bedroom—she had that nice bedroom. When I arrived, she said, "Okay, hello. Yes, I've called you to give you a lesson of philosophy, Indian philosophy." We were with Dania, and she said, "Don't panic. It will be very easy. You will have nothing to do, just watch."

She had invited a group of ladies whose husbands were working with Sir C.P., so there were people from the diplomatic services. They were from different countries; there was also a French one. Mother showed them the house, and I remember there was a lady who spotted the tea cozy with pearls—it was white with pearls. The lady said, "Oh, how nice it is." "Okay, you like it? Have it," Mother said. She was giving things away like this.

Then it was lunchtime; she had invited them for lunch. Dania and I were just standing behind the table, serving and passing some dishes. I remember the conversation was so strange because I was used to seeing Mother giving her spiritual lectures, and this was just about trivial things. But the kind of love she was giving to these ladies... they were talking about being fat and wanting to be slim, going on a diet. I remember they were all saying, "Oh yes, I need to slim down," and she was there looking at them, smiling, pouring love on them. In the end, she said, "Yes, it's nice, but you see, after a certain age, it's also nice to have a bit of padding on you." They were talking about very, very superficial things.

But what I noticed that day is that the kind of attention and love she was giving to these ladies was exactly the same she would give to us, even though they were not interested in her spirituality. It was quite amazing. In the end, they left, and she gave us a little present. I got a little mangalsutra, and Dania got a little brooch. Then she thanked us in such a warm way, "Thank you very much. You helped me so much." We were just there, completely flabbergasted, because we didn't feel we had helped. It was so strange.

Carol, you've been quiet for a while...
