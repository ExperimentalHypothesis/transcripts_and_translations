Mother's Day. Cabella (Italy), 13 May 2001.

“Mother” is a very special expression, especially in this country (Italy) – They have such respect for their mothers. The Mother is the source of love, in the Koran they asked Mohammed-sahib who they should bow to after Allah? So he said ‘to Mother’ – ‘To the Mother’ Then again they asked he said ‘only the Mother’, again they asked him he said ‘Only The Mother’ I’m sure he must have said about the divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are, we can say, examples of mother’s love, of divine mothers love, but they are human. So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of divine love. In divine love there is no expectation, it just flows, it doesn’t think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows.. and most of the people enjoy that, most . Some of them might take advantage, that makes no difference to the Mother. Because the love is like an ocean and because this love makes a Mother very humble, everything flows to the Mother. This Mother Earth now, see how much she does for us, without any expectation, but if you try to be unkind, try to be cruel, materialistic very much, then she acts according to the wishes of Shiva. She destroys such people, all the five elements are there, all the destruction forces that we have in those five elements, can be used by Shiva. Shiva watches the work of the Mother, and to a great extent he blesses. But if he finds that people are getting away from reality, from divinity, from goodness, from benevolence, then he gets annoyed and he punishes in his own cruel manner. It’s a very different role from that of a Mother. He doesn’t consult the Mother about it. He gets angry and really does something very sad sometimes, we find people get lost because of his anger. So to remain under the love of Mother is the best thing, because she expects nothing and she tries to solve your problems because she loves you without any anger, whatever you may do to her she doesn’t take any respite, revenge
