Arrival Talk at Meli ashram, Vienna (Austria), 12 October 1987.

Shri Mataji: My husband has asked Me to go there and bring that all. I told them that [inaudible] small children [inaudible] worked very hard. Nabhi is there why? Too much [sugar] all of them. (Laughter) All have worked very hard. [inaudible] very hard. Nabhi should be all right.

It is such a pleasure to see you, Sabine. (Laughter) [inaudible] I've never expected - just imagine [inaudible]. And I had nice lunch, very nice lunch I had. I had very good lunch, so no more lunch.

So when can you have time to go [Rahul ?] to do this? He has to go to India for that work of; you see he has got some sort of an order to do with some stamps in India. He has to go to organize that and also he wants to help in the house because I am here. So he was saying that you people have planned the whole thing. Akbar is there so you can go and help him a little bit, it can be done. I mean, it doesn't take much time. But for having this what you call that anti-dampness there, you see for removing the dampness. In India, we put a thick layer on the wall which is done in one day. He said the foundation must be laid that's all. Both of you should do some justice. He has gone for another work so we have to help him, in collective, isn't it?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: I will give a very good example of the collective. It's all right.

I said you have to consider that we are like a tree, all getting the sap from one tree. Now supposing a leaf which falls off during say winter time, what she does that in between the leaf and the branch they create a kind of a cork and because of the cork nothing can go to the leaf and the leaf falls off. In the same way, if you continue with our conditionings and our false ideas - I want to have a separate house, I want to have a nice family, to have a car of my own, of my own business then you become like that leaf and then you don't grow. So those people who say, "Oh we are meditating at home, we are doing this at home", they don't grow, because they are not getting the sap. You see they are just getting separated. This is the point many people miss and don't understand that how is it in the collective we grow better and not out of collective. So those who try to have their houses of a separately or say that, "No, no we would be alone and we'll have our own meditation, all that", never grow, this is the point is, never grow. You may have but you should always be the collective. You may have, is different.

They said they've got still the money for doing the foundation and My house is now being offered for a price but you know in London it takes at least one month or one and a half month for to get the money in your hand. But he says that once he has made the foundation then he does not have to do anything in the winter time. Then he would like to wait till he comes back from India in the month of February or March. Then it's all right.

Sahaja Yogi: When should it be done till Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

Sahaja Yogi: Before Christmas, before the winter, the foundation. When should it be done?

Shri Mataji: Foundation is to be done.

Sahaja Yogi: Before Christmas.

Shri Mataji: Yes. That's the problem and he had to go for this work there.

I think there has been a cosmic change because the way program was attended in Switzerland I was Myself surprized. Switzerland is the worst place for Sahaja Yoga, and it was so many people, very serious people, seeking people, and they sat down, they wanted to know, I mean really wonderful people came, very surprizing. And then the second was this Belgium, which where I never expected even twenty people to come in, there were about four-five hundred people, very serious, very good people, very sensible. We were amazed at them. Then came this Holland - same thing. Two programs - all full. Tremendous it was, can't believe it.

And the people were so nice and also asking very nice questions, and after the thing was over, they stayed back, some of them did not get Realization, they came forward, others were sitting down nobody would leave the hall. We had to tell them, "Now it's finished now. (Laughter) Better go home." (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) They would not go home. It's done-finished. (Laughter)

Same thing happened in Calcutta. The Lions Club had arranged a program. They all got Realization everything, everything was over, the music was over and I was about to leave. They were still sitting there. So they told, "Now it is finished, so you can go home." You see I think it's a bliss casualty. That's something surprizing.

Our aim should be now to give Bandhan, to do Yagnya to get good people. Because if you touch the right type of people then there is no problem, but Austria is very lucky that way I must say. You get right type of people all there, you are very lucky people. But in England I have to see, we had one program arranged but now it is being decided, I have to leave for India earlier and American tour has been cancelled, because so many things are to be done still in India, and I am sitting down here. So what will, so many people coming you see so many things to be organized and - right from your kurtas to your saris. (Shri Mataji laughing) Such a lot of work is to be done still. So I was thinking if I can leave by 25th or so, 24th or 25th, so if you people could just send away all the money everything in time. Then I should go and try to organize it. Because organizing itself is quite a big problem.

All right now, I think the Nabhi is better.

Sahaja Yogi: Better Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Improved. Yes it's still numb. But new people should be asked to come because what I have seen unless and until you go to India don't settle down, isn't it? There is something about it. It's a fact. One has to go to India otherwise they won't settle down. They should be prepared and be put on liver diet. (Laughter) So as it is this is the condition. Then they go there and they have the sun then they vomit [on]. So it is better that they should be prepared here and they should be told that what caution they have to take. Of course food matters, I always tell them to give them simpler carbohydrate food as far as possible. Sometimes of course they give you little fried things, but sometimes. But it is to be prepared in the sense that you have to take a course for about a month on liver. Better go on a liver diet. This is a hot country after all, but better to be there because what Sabine told Me that last January when they returned it was minus 25 degrees. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Last year.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Sahaja Yogi: Yeah, it was heavy snow fall and it was extremely cold.

Shri Mataji: He'll be back by the, I think twelfth or so you'll be back but those who want to stay on, we can arrange your stay there; no problem, to avoid the winters. (Laughter) Minus 25.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes it's very, very cold.

Shri Mataji: That's going too far. (Laughter) Something should be done about it, isn't it. (Laughter) It's like worse than Himalayas. (Shri Mataji laughing) Yeah? And before going to London do you know that London was all drenched and there was water up to this much, the whole of south of England. People were wading through and were going in a canoe from places to places. It's terrible. But when I reached there the rain stopped. And today it was such a nice sunny day, unbelievable. Switzerland is even worse, you see. I was saying that we should have our programs in January, because January is the worst month here, than December. But they thought because of Christmas holidays it's better. But January is a much colder month.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is a very cold month. It is the coldest month in fact, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Hm. Now better.

Sahaja Yogi: I think Shri Mataji the ashramites are a little bit to be blamed, we were drinking coffee working really very, very long.

Shri Mataji: That's why Heart and Nabhi is catching. Yes. It's so beautiful. But there was no need to work that hard. Worked very hard, beautiful. You see, but one thing I've seen that all events help you to improve, isn't it. Like when I went to Shudy Camps, they said half an hour before that, (Laughter) the situation was very bad. And I saw all of you with the tape this running (Laughter) and My husband was saying, "Let's go, let's go." I said, "No, no, no, just wait. (Laughter) Still time, still time." He said, "No, no, they must be waiting." I said, "No, no, no, I know, I know." So I was stopping him from going. Because I knew that there was some problem going on, still people running up and down. (Laughter) So I came at the right time when it was all done and I said, "Now right time." (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) They were all rushing around. I know that, last minute. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji when we arrived in Shudy Camps on Friday night it was 3 o'clock in the morning and we thought everybody will sleeping but everybody was up working, from each window people were looking out and welcoming us nicely. It was such a surprise. (Shri Mataji laughing) It's very good for us that we were.

Shri Mataji: Shudy Camps has done good to England very much. There's a lot of collectivity working together they have developed, this is good idea. They had finished with money, I don't know what they have done. Now they have got it they said for the kitchen. I made another type of a kitchen for them but the architect has done something else, doesn't matter whatever it is, after all architects are architects. (Laughter) My house was planned in India that the house was the zero point they took it the highest point, that was only where the car can arrive, highest point was zero. From there they made a big platform so the lowest point was twenty two feet and that was My room, so I would be hanging in the air. Only when you arrive in the house, when you jump out of your car you are on the ground, otherwise you are all on top. I said, "This is too much." So when the architects had gone for leave for two, three days, (Laughter) I made that fellow start the house from the zero which was the lowest. I said, "You do it as I tell you, you do it." He said, "But they'll come and shout." I said, "They'll not come till I really finish all this." So I made the foundation from that point and we got a complete twenty feet height halls underneath that. Otherwise imagine what an expense it is to build such a big platform and what a waste it would have been. Good for nothing and I have bought this land just to be on the Mother Earth, because all My life I have lived like this you see, so just to touch the Mother Earth and here you are hanging at twenty two feet with the architects' Krupa, grace. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

So the architects came back, they were amazed. They said, "What have You done?" I said, "I have put one Tiffin carrier box on to another that's all, done nothing." They had spread it like this, one this side, one this side. What I made I put this down and put the other one on top of that. (Laughter) Turned out very well. And we saved lot of space and all that and we could do lot of justice to the whole area. But they didn't say anything they didn't know and then they said, "Mother, now we have learned this is the way the house should be." I said, "Yes, the house should crawl upon the land, it should not be some sort of a hanging in the air business, no good." But that's labor saving, you know, but not money saving. It looks very nice because you come up and then you come with few steps down and then you come with few steps down in the drawing room see it looks very - what you should say - full of character and coziness, looks very much better than to just walk like a hospital from here to there. It has turned out very well. Now when you will go and see, then you will know what your Mother has done.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji this is the limitation of our three dimensions, we cannot see it sometimes.

Shri Mataji: He said it. He said it. You have said it. Today only when we were coming the little box would not fit in. In the four dimensions I knew it will fit - I said, "No, it will fit." (Laughter) And it fitted. Like you see Laurent was there and I had planned one staircase you see, you saw My staircase in Brompton Square and I told him, "Now I am resting for half an hour you fix this up." When I got up he said, "Mother this cannot be fixed." I said, "Why, why cannot be?" He was measuring it, again measuring that - measuring. I said, "Just bring it I'll fix it just now." He brought it and it went [khat ?] into it and just fixed. (Laughter) But the best was, this is the best miracle which cannot be explained but somebody can explain, you better explain it. We left Geneva and My vanity case and another bag was left somewhere there. When we got down in Belgium we didn't find anything there. So these people looked into, they went up into the aircraft. It was not there. They said Mother we never brought it. It was left there, these people never gave us, we remember for definite. We had other things, flowers, this that, four five things in our hands. So then they went to the lost-and-found, they didn't find it. We came out, we got into the car, suddenly they showed Me, "Mother is it Yours?" I said, "Yes." They said, "There was one man Indian, he brought this and he said this belongs to this lady. And he gave it to us." I said, "Who was he?" He said, "Don't know." And it was written on that Air Canada and My name. I never came by Air Canada. Now how do you explain? (Laughter) Can you? Just can't understand. This cannot be explained. I never came by Air Canada all these years and just can't understand. And this Indian didn't tell his name, he just disappeared in the thin air, we never saw him.

Now better. What do you say?

Sahaja Yogi: It's also less thought now.

Shri Mataji: Left Vishuddhi. That is one thing is a problem. Left Vishuddhi is so common. Every country [no, not only] but worst was in Switzerland I think they are feeling guilty because they've got those banks.

Better now.

I don't know why you feel guilty. I think the young people feel guilty, the old people are doing wrong things - why what's the use for young people feeling guilty for the old people? You see the old people should feel guilty about it what they are doing because it's a vicious circle, you see. They lend money to this bank - what you call World Bank. Then World Bank lends money to us and it comes to all the thugs in our countries. And then all of it goes back to Swiss bank and then the Swiss bank again lends it to World Bank. So we are in debt without doing anything about it. Isn't it funny, isn't it funny? Absolutely the way people go on doing things like that openly and they have a red cross. It's quite a contradiction in life. Like Nobel Peace Prize and this Nobel company is making weapons of war. And they give Nobel Peace Prize. What do you say to that?

So now who is the other architect? No, that I know. I know you also. Who else?

Sahaja Yogi: Youcef. Is he here? He was at the airport Shri Mataji. But he is not here.

Shri Mataji: Yes, Youcef.

Sahaja Yogi: He will finish soon.

Shri Mataji: About to finish.

Sahaja Yogi: Yeah. About to finish.

Shri Mataji: Better. It's peaceful now. I think today when you sang all that we were all also became very emotional. Didn't expect all that, it's most unexpected, just unexpected. So many things happen in Sahaja Yoga unexpectedly, such joy and happiness. Just the other fingers are now releasing.

Now I couldn't get much for you people from India because we went down to Switzerland which is a place where even if you are carrying a fountain pen from India they'll stop you, very horrible people. But I've got a little present for your leader. (Laughter) Where is he gone? Derek? Will you bring that plastic bag. I hope it fits you, I mean I just.

It's quite a lot of left Vishuddhi. What to feel guilty I just don't understand what do you feel guilty about? You have done nothing wrong. What have you done? Are you feeling guilty?

Sahaja Yogi: At the moment I don't.

Shri Mataji: No, no. Rather serious. What's the matter? (Laughter)

You're not to feel guilty. Who is feeling guilty? Please don't feel guilty. Don't feel guilty. I catch on My left Vishuddhi, then on right Vishuddhi, then on left Vishuddhi, then right Vishuddhi. All right, don't feel guilty. Just say to yourself, "Mother, I am not guilty." For what to feel guilty I just don't understand. Austria is doing the best. They say that in the whole of Europe Austria has done the best. Now what is there to feel bad. All very proud of it and that we have such good people in Austria, such good people are coming to Sahaja Yoga. Really some very substantial people are here. Alganesh telephoned to say that we have got a huge big lined up people for interview for this, for that. (Shri Mataji laughing) As soon as I arrived there they are going to stand with Me asking this is this, this is this, this is this. I tell, "Baba, give Me some time." She said, "Mother, they are so many I don't know what to do with them."

Sahaja Yogi: We have tried our best with the press Shri Mataji, but we are still not comparable to Italy, what this is concerned. The public relation is still very closed.

Shri Mataji: It's good, there's no need to bother. See mostly they're very rude people, give distorted things, better not to have them anywhere there. I don't like them at all. They're not at all constructive.

Not this one no, no, no - no, no, no, no, not this one. The other one, the other one with My shawl. Not this one. This is for India.

Now has he got it or not? I hope he's not lost it.

Sahaja Yogi: No. I think we put it in.

(Applause + laughter)

Shri Mataji: It's a silk coat. It is not from Delhi, it is from Paris. I hope you like it.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji last time I got a golden tie and this time is the jacket, it fits fantastic together. Thank you very much Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: May God bless you!

(Applause)

You see just see how I know My children so well. (Laughter + Shri Mataji laughing) Fitting so well ah. Beautiful it looks. Like - it's very good.

Sahaja Yogi: Exactly the right size Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Ah.

Sahaja Yogi: Bolo Shri Adi Shakti Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jay! (Shri Mataji laughing)

Shri Mataji: What a pleasure. This is My shawl for Me. So now I'll go and take some rest. But no lunch for Me please, because I had lunch. She arranged a very good lunch for Me and I ate a very good cake also. I never eat cake normally, you know, but she had made a special one which one was made out of just nuts. Beautiful it was, very light and nice she had made. Looks very nice on you, I must say. (Laughter) Even the hair goes well. (Laughter)

Sahaja Yogi: I mean if you see with the other tie Shri Mataji, it fits exactly. I got a tie from You, it fits exactly to this jacket.

Shri Mataji: Really? (Laughter) But how it fits you just see. And I bought it in America, made in Paris. (Laughter)

May God bless you!

May God bless you all! Thank you very much! Thank you! Ah hello, how are you, these two babies and [inaudible] everyone there.

Sahaja Yogi: This is the Viennese flag, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: That is what I asked what is your flag?

Sahaja Yogi: That's the Viennese flag, Austrian flag.

Shri Mataji: It's the mothers' color.

Sahaja Yogi: It's from the Monarchy, the crown and the symbol of the labor and those are the. Also the liberty, the chain which has been...

Shri Mataji: Broken.

Sahaja Yogi: Broken, yes.

Shri Mataji: [inaudible] you feel you are walking in the garden [inaudible] you won't believe in My garden [inaudible] flowers with beautiful fragrance because they are vibrated. But I don't know what happened. [inaudible] they say they have never seen that [inaudible].
