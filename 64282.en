[English part only]

Please be seated. Now, I think the Western Sahaja Yogis should move out a little bit because these people are going to sing some bhajans. So those who are sitting in front can move out a little bit. They have, they need some space. Today we cannot afford to have many programs. Only we'll have a program about for an hour by the, these people from here, the Sahaja Yogis, they want to entertain you with bhajans. And then tomorrow morning, I'm sorry, it's going to be quite cold, so you better not have your baths early in the morning in the sea. Get up about five o'clock, have your breakfast and leave by six, you have to leave by six. Or leave by five-thirty is better. Keep it five-thirty so you'll leave at six. Hello, Nick? You can carry two or three persons in your, you can.

Nick: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All right. Because now suddenly three more extra people have come. All right. So, can you?

Yogi: Shri Mataji, one hundred and ninety nine for tomorrow, so it shouldn't be a problem if they miss the buses?

Shri Mataji: No problem. They haven't arrived yet? They'll go to Nasik? All right. No, they're going to Nasik. So till Nasik there's no problem, but three persons can be with them in there. How many?

Nick: There's only space for five or four people.

Shri Mataji: So how many of you are there?

Nick: There will be four of us who are the crew for the recording.

Shri Mataji: Four? Four, who are the four?

Yogi: We've been a bit nervous before our buses and we can't remember getting a phone or something like that.

Yogi: Well obviously yeah we've...

Shri Mataji: Just now there's no problem, but might be later on. We'll see now. All right, what is it? I just called you for that. They have composed some music for you and they want you to hear the music. Then you have to sleep early and you have to get up early and you have to go tomorrow morning. Because you like this place, I thought you'd better stay here overnight.

These are all Sahaja Yogis from this place and villages nearby.

These are the simple fishermen, folk from here, who have done all the cleaning and all the decorations, everything. They got it from their boats, all these timber to decorate your Mother's stage and all the comforts that you see here are coming from them and their wives. They're all your brothers and sisters. Very simple way you have written these beautiful songs. Just to welcome us, especially me, that they're singing the first song was that before everybody else we bowed to you, Mother. That one was the best. Then you gave them all these little presents from your heart. Now the second one that they are saying that when we we see your, get your darshan. That means when we have seen you, our music has got the colour of bhakti. And in that bhakti we are now singing your song. We are simple people and our bhakti is also as simple as ourselves. So please accept our bhakti. They beautifully sang and beautifully composed all for Sahaja Yoga. They are all Sahaja Yogis from this place. And you see the innocence in them when they sing, how they are disciplined among themselves and how they work it out. In a very sweet manner and in a very beautiful tunes. So I'm so happy that you all have appreciated without understanding it. Perhaps the vibrations are flowing such a lot that you could understand. It's something nice. It's all to please your Mother. They are singing and they have composed it beforehand and now they are big hits over. So we give them a hand by thanking them.
