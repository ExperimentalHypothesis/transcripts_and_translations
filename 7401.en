Public Program (with German translation). Zürich (Switzerland), 21 August 1981.

Shri Mataji: First of all, I must really apologise for being so late. There was some confusion about time so please forgive Me. I am really encouraged to see that there are seekers in this country and they are trying to seek something beyond. I could not think of any country where there could not be seekers.  Because when [UNCLEAR], I am sure any intelligent man who thinks must be wondering, asking, “What is next?”

[Translator requests to repeat].

I was saying that I could not believe that in any country, people would be satisfied with what they have and they would not be seeking beyond. Because seeking is the process of your evolution. Through seeking you have achieved this state, this human state. And even now you do not know the meaning of your life, at this stage. Neither the purpose. So, one has to think, “Why are we here? Why were we made human beings? What was the purpose of nature? Was that just to earn you money and little material comforts and done?”

And a question must be asked within, are you satisfied? Are you happy? And once we ask this question to ourselves, we find out we are not. We have not found out the purpose of our life. Actually, we don’t know about ourselves. We may now know about the moon or Saturn or going to all those places. But we do not know about ourselves. And so, anybody who is intelligent as a human being must be saying there is something else.

But one problem is that people who are seeking beyond have been shocked by people [UNCLEAR]. Those who are seeking seek others who know what is God, what is beyond. They are shocked to see the way they behave. Because when you see a religious person, you get shocked. Because he is religious and he is so cruel. He is religious, how can he be cruel? And then also you see that they are actually hypocrites.

So you don’t know what to do. Now, it is very easy to say we don’t believe in all that and then turn back. It is very easy to turn your back - saying this is all nonsense - and we turn our back. Because we cannot see the light, accept the dark. And live with it. But you can’t live with darkness. You tried. People have tried to live with darkness and they have after-effects of that. They have the after-effects of living with the darkness.

You bump into each other. You bump into each other. You collide with each other. When you live in darkness, you collide. Nations have fought against each other. Wars came up. We have peace and we prepare for war [UNCLEAR] wisdom. These are signs that you are in the dark. It has to be very, very natural for all of you to think that there must be something beyond.

The other day a journalist came to see Me. She is a Swiss journalist, came to see Me in London. She said the people are very happy in Switzerland. There is nothing wrong with them. I said, “Are you sure?” Because they were competing with Sweden in committing suicide. And now they are much ahead of them. Even with all this affluence, why are they committing suicide? We should try to find out.

If you want to close your eyes to reality, you can do it - for the time being. But if you look at it, how ghastly it is that young people are trying to commit suicide. I met three Swedish girls who were studying in London at Cambridge. And their vibrations were such as if they were committing suicide. Or they were dead or sort of some [UNCLEAR]; horrible vibrations they had. I said, “What are you doing in Cambridge? What do you do all day?” They said, “All the time we are planning how to commit suicide in a sophisticated manner”.

Look at the sunset today, how beautiful. Look at the beautiful flowers in the garden. Look at the beautiful country. Look at this room, how beautiful. And you cannot feel the joy. You cannot enjoy. Something has gone wrong. There is no spontaneity to feel this joy so good. Is it something lacking within us? Just ask a question. “Is there something lacking within us that we cannot enjoy?”

[UNCLEAR statement]. After I went away, I read that Zurich had riots. If through material advancement you had achieved your peace, there should be no riots. That means people are not happy, there is frustration - let us face it. In my last visit, I discovered something else also, very serious. Cancer, which is the disease of the rich, is groping the country. But the richer you are, the larger the number of cancer patients.

The fourth thing that I felt was that children are dying in their beds. [UNCLEAR]. Yesterday I heard the news in England that every year there are five to six thousand children lost. Six thousand children lost. In England, every week two children are killed by their parents. I mean, it’s worse than Hitler. He didn’t kill his own children. So all these things are happening in [UNCLEAR] and if you are not aware of it, the whole thing will come up like [UNCLEAR]. So one has to see, on the collective side and the individual side, what’s going wrong with us.

Now I would like you to take what I say, as a hypothesis. And as a scientist, you must keep your mind open and not closed. If it actualises, then you must accept. But you keep yourself very open to listen to what I am going to tell you because it is for the benefit of the individual and the whole.

And you should not be like journalists, say, when you tell them about Switzerland, they will start talking about India. They are more worried about others than they are about themselves. We have to correct ourselves; we can only correct ourselves. So when I am in Switzerland, I am Swiss. And I am concerned.

Now here you find within us, in this triangular bone called the sacrum, a force called Kundalini. This bone is called as sacrum means sacred bone. That’s a Greek word. That’s a Greek word that means Greeks knew what was sacred. Now this force resides within us as a germinating force resides in a seed. Now, this has to be so because something has to happen within you; attract your attention inside.

Human attention is very different from the attention of animals. Because human beings have a brain that is triangular, which is modelled like a prism. So the attention is going out instead of staying inside. And evolution that took place so far did not need this kind of a happening. Because within us, this power which is called the power of desire and this power which is called the power of action, build up two pouches called superego and ego. By ego we assert and by superego we condition ourselves. Assert, aggress. And when they develop in childhood, these two meet at a point here, where they get calcified. On the fontanelle bone area. It becomes calcified.

In the heart here resides the Spirit. Now the seat of the Spirit is there where you are seeing the sunlight - seat of the Spirit. The head above, the seat. But it resides in the heart. In human beings, especially. Now, when it rises - this Kundalini, when she awakens - she rises through these centres and touches that Spirit. You can see the pulsation of this Kundalini in many people. You can see pulsation, just like the heart. And when it pierces also, you can feel the throbbing in the beginning. And at the back also, if you use a stethoscope, you can see it throbbing, and sometimes with the eyes, you can see it as well.

But, one has to remember one thing about Kundalini. Many Germans have written about Kundalini. They had had no experience; they just read some books and did it. They went as tourists and they met all the people. They went as tourists. And that is how they touched the periphery of the nation - never reached the Reality. They met horrible, negative people and they told that Kundalini can be only aroused through sex. And this triangle you see is the one that controls the sex. That is below the Kundalini. This centre, there.

So sex has a part to play in married life, in a sane married life - but not in Kundalini. Human beings are now above it. Because these are the stepping stones of your evolution. Now you are saying the sex is your Kundalini and that is so absurd, as She is your mother, and is a very gentle relationship, is a very private relationship. Holy mother, She is your holy mother.

We can reason it out in a simple way. We can reason it out also. You see, animals have much more sex life than human beings have. They have free sex. Are they going to evolve before we are going to evolve? We have nothing to learn from them. We are ahead of them. They have to learn from us.

Now some horrible people from India came here to take out your money and to trouble you by telling all kinds of stories. You should reason out. That you cannot pay for anything innate. How much did you pay to become a human being? What effort did you put in to become a human being? It is spontaneous. For example, if you have to breathe and if we have to read books for that, half of us would be finished the next moment. We see so many living miracles but we do not pay any attention to them.

See a flower becoming a fruit. Can you pay for it? If it is a living process, it should be spontaneous. But they wanted to exploit humans, your naiveness. There is another guru, I am told that Germans and Japanese are - very popular with them, this guru - was, Rajneesh. Because he taught them free sex. For Western people, they don’t need a guru for that. You already have mastered it. And to pay money to somebody in thousands and thousands of, in millions and millions of money, is foolishness, is stupidity.

Now this fellow, I must say, thank God, has got paralysis and has run away from that ashram. Now his own disciples have burnt his ashram and he had collected such a lot of books you see, all [UNCLEAR]. And in Switzerland, you are harbouring all these thugs from all over the world. They have put their sinful money in your banks and you will have to pay for it.

Now one has to understand that God and sin do not go hand in hand. God and sin do not go hand in hand. God is holy as [UNCLEAR]. And one has to cleanse oneself to be one with him. And it is the most blissful thing that should happen. Because He is joy and bliss and complete peace. And when it happens to you, it is so spontaneous that you get the whole thing in a pack. Like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly. Or an egg becomes a bird.

But these things stick on to you. These things stick on to you. Of the part of the caterpillar sticks onto you so you must learn how to get rid of them. You must learn how to achieve your complete transformation and complete freedom and liberation. So that you become the master. So you become master of yourself. Nothing can dominate you. And you start using the power, the divine power of Love. Which is so pure and so close. Emits through your being.

You become the instrument of God or His powers. You know how to manoeuvre it and enjoy it. This is why you have become a human being. Like you can say - I always give the example of television. For an ordinary villager, say in India, it’s like a box. Like a box. For us, human beings are nothing but a box. As if, see we also treat ourselves as if just a box, nothing more than that. But once you are put to the mains, this fantastic instrument of yours starts working. The power of love. Which cures your body, heals you completely.

Cancer can only be cured by this happening. If you read the pamphlet you will see how cancer is caused and cured through Sahaja Yoga; you will know. It’s very scientific. We have two doctors in London who are working it out. One of them is working in cancer research. His name is Steve [UNCLEAR]. Another is David. They are working out how to tell these scientists.

Now you young people of Switzerland must open your eyes to this new science that has descended upon you. And must not be comfortable and complacent about what you got from your elders who did not think about it. Because this is a gift for you. This is your own. And you are on the top of evolution. You are so beautiful - it should not be wasted. This world has to be changed. This transformation has to take place.

All the great scriptures have said about it. And predicted it. They all have said you have to be born again. But you cannot give a false certificate to yourself. You cannot give a false certificate to yourself. You have to get it. It is to be actualised. In India, there are thousands who have got it. Even in London, about two, three thousand - about, all together. England. America also we have some thousand. I don’t know exactly, because there is no organisation. America, when I went in seventy-three, gave realisation to about three thousand people.

Australia, also we have given realisation to - how many you can say, Warren?

Warren: One thousand.

Shri Mataji: At least one thousand who have mastered. One thousand people have mastered. Two places are really lacking behind. Switzerland and Germany. So you must awaken yourselves. You people will be held responsible if you do not respond to it. There is no money to be paid. Because you cannot sell it. You don’t have to put in any effort. You get it as a right. As your own right, birthright. Only thing, after getting it, you must establish yourself.

Actually, it is a collective happening. It’s a mass happening. Of course, it moves slowly in the West, I have seen that. They can be easily hypnotised. Western people can be much more hypnotised than Indians are. They go into crazy things like flying; I don’t know why, imagine. There is a guru who wants them to fly. And thousands go to him. Are you going to become birds now? I don’t understand - why ask for flying? And does this guru fly himself? You put him on this leaning tower of Pisa and see if he can fly.

They are befooling you like this and how can you be fooled? You are intelligent people. You had such a great person like Christ coming down here. Maybe these religions which are organised religions made stupid people. Maybe these religions which tried to organise Christ did stupid things. That doesn’t mean that Christ was wrong. Did He organise anything like that? Did He charge any money? Did He live like a parasite on others' money?

But I was amazed the other day in England, I went to a place. They said, “Mother if we pay money we feel secure”. Like Swiss bank, where you have to pay money to keep the money. All the thugs feel very secure if their money is here. You have to change the lot of the people of Switzerland. “Lot” of the people. Fate.

The whole world is going to change. It is predicted. It is predicted. You should not lag behind.

They understand French, is it? All right. It’s all right, but why not have realisation? You see, My speech has no meaning. Why don’t they have realisation?

[UNCLEAR/a lady is probably saying they were not able to hear/ the translator was not audible].

Shri Mataji: Louder? I am speaking louder than him. Didn’t follow? I am sorry. You didn’t follow at all?

[UNCLEAR/seeker speaking in French].

Shri Mataji: I know you were paying too much attention to follow him. I know that. What is to be done? That’s a good idea. So let us have it now.
