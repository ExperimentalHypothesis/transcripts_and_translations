It's that where the cities work. You can go for your work. Staying in the city is not so good for sahaja yogis. You see, vibration-wise and also not good for your lungs, you see. It's better to be little away if you want to meditate and First and foremost thing is that you have to ascend; For that you should be in a place which will help you to ascend otherwise if you live in the city, the city have baba, the city all nonsense - can't even meditate properly and it's so polluted, it spoils your lungs completely. So it would be nice, it would be little away from the city. Try to find some house of that kind and first you have to give a mortgage for that house which you can do all of you put together and then you have to pay the rent of the house as the mortgage, part of the mortgage, so you own it also. I think, we desire for some time [UNCLEAR], I'll let You know, Mother. - [UNCLEAR] - He's saying, "I have desired for some time to earn something rather than pay rent." You see if you can, whatever is possible, you see, if you can own something, nothing like it but can you - you see, this is the way I said that you first pay the first installment - I'd like to know what is it? How much do you have to pay for the first installment?

They said, " It is 10%." If you take a big house, then 10% would be quite a lot then can somebody pay so much? - No, so then renting is the best. - Long journeys I mean, in sahaja terms 20 years is not, is an awful long time but in terms of a lease it's not very long. You can ask for 20 years lease and It can be more; In London you can get it for 99 years lease, you see and so you can shift to a place like that and there's also some short leases also - that's very cheap. So you have to go through all that because you can't afford to pay the basic [DEPOSIT]. Like in Melbourne, somebody has offered 30 thousand but with 30 thousand, three hundred thousand pounds worth of thing - is it big enough, yeah - if you are outside? Yes Shrimataji, real estate is not as expensive in Brisbane or around Brisbane. - but you check this side - It's much cheaper here; Real estate is much cheaper here. - I see.

So how much, do you think, a big house will cost here? - Hardly 70 thousand. - Very big house? - Big house - Two hundred, say two hundred thousand - Two hundred thousand so 10% would be 20 thousand, so you'll have to put in about 10 thousand pounds, alright? I can organize that 10 thousand - I'll see. Then, is it alright? - Then you can pay the mortgage? - I'm not sure we would, Shri Mataji. - Because if you have a lease for say, fifty - His work? - You can go for your work Staying in the city is not so good for sahaja yogis, you see, vibration-wise and also not good for your lungs, you see.

It's better to be little away if you want to meditate and [UNCLEAR]. First and foremost thing is that you have to ascend, for that you should be in a place which will help you to ascend. Otherwise if you live in the city, the city have baba, in the city all nonsense - can't even meditate properly and it's so polluted, it spoils your lungs completely so it would be nice, it would be little away from the city. Try to find some house of that kind and first you have to give a mortgage for that house which you can do with all of you put together and then you have to pay the rent of the house as the mortgage, part of the mortgage so you own it also. I think, we desire for some time to earn [UNCLEAR] a place, I'll let You know, Mother. - Didn't follow that. - He's saying I have desire for sometime to earn something rather than pay rent. You see, if he can, whatever is possible. You see if you can own something, nothing like it but can you; You see, this is the way I said that you first pay the first installment - I would like to know what is it. How much do you have to pay for the first installment?

They said, "It is 10%." If you take a big house, then 10% would be quite a lot and can somebody pay so much? - No. So then renting is the best. - Long term lease. I mean, in sahaja terms twenty years is not, is an awful long time but in terms of a lease it's not very long. you can ask for twenty year lease It can be more; In London you can get it for 99 years lease, you see, and so you can shift to a place like that and there's also some short leases also, that's very cheap. So, you have to go through all that because you can't afford to pay the basic [DEPOSIT]. Like in Melbourne somebody has offered thirty thousand but with thirty thousand, 300 thousand pounds worth of thing is it big enough? Yeah.

If you are outside? - Yes, Shri Mataji. Real estate is not as expensive in Brisbane or around Brisbane - if you take this side. - It's much cheaper here, Shri Mataji. Real estate is much cheaper here. - I see. So how much, you think, a big house will cost here? - Hardly 70 thousand. - Very big house? - Big house.

Two hundred, say two hundred thousand - Definitely. - Two hundred thousand So, 10% would be twenty thousand. So you'll have to put in about ten thousand pounds, alright? I can organize that ten thousand - I'll see. Then, is it alright? Then you can pay the mortgage? - I'm not sure - we would share. - Because if you have a lease for say 15 years, 20 years then you can pay. Shri Mataji, I live in a house in [UNCLEAR] and so we could get some money by selling that house although that's a wise thing to do - just sold my house [UNCLEAR] - Annh? He has a house of his own which he could sell to get the money - I just could, I can't hear because of [UNCLEAR] - [UNCLEAR] - Yes, better [UNCLEAR] it down - So?

He says that he has a house that he earns, because he could sell to raise money but he doesn't know whether that's a good idea. Why not, if you can sell that, you can have another bigger house and in the rent you can have mortgage as well as they can pay back your money. I think what Mother is saying if you did that, you would be in your house and you would rent it to the collective. - So in fact you could [UNCLEAR] - No, no, no that he cannot do because you see, the amount that he'll have to pay - how much would you fetch from your house? - Mother, I get eighty thousand - About? - Eighty thousand - That doesn't solve the problem - It's a big, big deposit eighty thousand. - Yes it is big deposit but that doesn't solve the problem; They have to get the mortgage as well. - Oh, yes, yes. - Alright. Then you can compensate it.

With the rent - he can take his own money and the money can go to mortgage as well. - Hmm. Oh, yes, yes. I'll show the house and if that's suitable option was taken would the house be mine Yes, to be, to be this thing, the house should be in your name and mortgage has to be taken - alright? and that mortgage can be completed by the rent of these people that they are giving plus you can also, they can pay you the money that you have paid for. Alright, so that that house then becomes the house of these people. Naturally, once they've paid you back then that house becomes the collective property. Mother, You, You said in the other cities that You want people to live together. - Yes. - He's thinking of having a lot of people in one place for - a lot of smaller [UNCLEAR] spread around.

No, no, no. You should have - one big house in which all of you should live - like Burwood. - Yes, Mother. That's My - the children and everyone and you could even have a school. As many as can live in that. They should sell all - all of them should sell their houses and adjust it. There're some very nice properties, not very far from here, where you can buy an acre or so of land and still be very close to the city. It's much better this kind of thing, if you can do it. Nothing like it if that works out, nothing like it. Yes, in Brisbane you can do that - it is still small.

In Sydney if you want to go out - it takes all day to get there. - [UNCLEAR] - In Brisbane it's possible to do that - you want to have a land outside - because it's still very close but in Sydney it takes you half a day to get there so it's not good. - That's correct. - So you'll buy the land you mean to say - is he saying so? - He could - No it's - then mortgage you can't get na? If you have a house - You have to build the house on it - They give mortgage for building the house? - Oh, yes. - Yes, particularly if you own the land - Is it so? Then you can work it out. - You have options.

A large house, no house and build the house you want [UNCLEAR] you are in Perth, fine, possibly. - Renovating - Renovating - He now working her out - Yes, Mother. First you must find out a big property which is already there - it'll be better. - [UNCLEAR - I ASKED?] already there. - Yes, that is the best. Then renovate it or alter it to suit. Possibly add on to it. For the time being, I think, that's a better idea is to get the house and put the deposit there and start it in the big house a big property. Also they know each [UNCLEAR] and then charge the rent from the people which will repay your money as well as the mortgage.

Better now? You put it here also - Yes, Mother. - To that side - [UNCLEAR] lunch and then rest, alright. Could I have some lunch? - Yes I think, you just sit down and first of all, find out. If you have the newspaper, I might be able to see something. [LAUGHTER] Let's have the newspaper. Everyday you have to find out - it's very easy. How we got Shudy Camp? How we did it?

I mean, it's all remarkable! In sahaja yoga every thing works out, if you have desire. They have to have pure desire and do not go on diverting your mind. Just put your attention to it. You want to have an ashram - it will work. - [UNCLEAR] Little table - Hmm - Where would You like to have Your lunch Mother? - Inside. - Inside - [YOGIS CONVERSING] - I'll see to - [UNCLEAR] for tonight. - It's beautiful! - There were three [UNCLEAR] in three different packets - Friday, yesterday and today, Mother - Yeah.

Even London it's selling here Where do you have this? - This is for the whole of the Australia? - [UNCLEAR] - They have also the same mantras, save dollars - Plus payment [UNCLEAR] They have got royal [UNCLEAR] things and all these for sale. [UNCLEAR] - This is for Victoria? - No, for Queensland, Shri Mataji. - This is all Victoria. No, no this is all, this is the Golf course, New South Wales, this is all Central and North Queensland These all places are all too far away have to be houses - It is not - Saturday is the best paper, much better [UNCLEAR] Quite cheap this one is - see; Five bedrooms, stately home, plus five what - 106 - 106 - Just imagine! - Which one? - [UNCLEAR] - About 60 kilometers away.

It's too far - Hot? - [UNCLEAR] I don't think this paper is very good, Shri Mataji. They don't put very much in here Sunday paper; It's all in a Saturday - [UNCLEAR] No, you see, this was - Sixty miles away it's too far - Oh, I see. - that's why it's cheap This is the Saturday paper [UNCLEAR] - Excuse me Shri Mataji. Would you like some [UNCLEAR - FRUIT?]? - Now, just see this one. There are for renovation also some - it's quite big. - This one is [UNCLEAR] - Very far away? - That's very far - Very far away? - No, it's about ten kilometers from here, Mother.

It's not much ten kilometers - There's another one, quite big. - Yeah, it's bigger - expensive. - This will be - They've not given. - half a million dollars. - But here it's uh.. - This one is nice - Yes - and this is some for renovation also. - This whole thing Mother is the old Queensland [UNCLEAR] - Hmm - and underneath you can do [UNCLEAR] as well - add two floors. - This is for renovation but is it alright? - This is - Area. Annh? - in a city, very close to the city - So?

Price is not there. - This is for auction, means go auctions. - Let us see this. - Hmm If you are on the lookout, you might get this. Quite nice; I think, it's quite big also but it hasn't got too many bedrooms and This fairly small block of land is over 20, 21.6 purchase. - Means quite small? - Uh.. It's about three quarters of the size of this block. - Uhh! - Very small!

Yes, Mother. - This is extra large, they said, 'This is extra large house.' - Hmm. This one looks nice, Mother. - Hmm. - Three [UNCLEAR] - This also is auctioned? - Yes. This big block of land 56 purchase. [UNCLEAR] - This is nice, I think, this looks alright.Why not see this one? - Yes, Mother.

This looks alright to Me. - It's quite spread out - Yes, Mother. - Good, then you can do something more than, if the land is too much and they say, 'Extra large'. This one is - It's far away? - Uh.., somewhere outside, yes. - It's about 15 kilometers from the city, that's 20 kilometers from here. - Uh huh. - This [UNCLEAR] is only 10 kilometers you said. - Yes, but the other thing also is some of the children have started in some schools - and we better have them going to the same schools, perhaps, rather than have them change - To what schools they are going to? Uh.. this boy Chris is going to High school this year and [UNCLEAR] State School and so we were thinking of standing [UNCLEAR] in the city.

No, but they can come to the school - no problem. See, what I'm trying to say is that, after some time we'll send them to India, isn't it, in any case. It's a question of... [LAUGHTER] - This one, Mother [UNCLEAR] 10 acres. - But acres what to do - you can't do anything, na. - Unnh? - Nice and quiet in there [UNCLEAR] - No, no but, you see, you cannot, if you have such a lot of acres, what do you do there? - Look at that, is it helpful? - Umm. It could be used for farming or growing vegetables. - [UNCLEAR] - There's a dam on it.

Probably something about one acre will be there or half acre - Has too much, you see, is a waste; You can't build anything - if you can, then it's alright. [UNCLEAR - DO NOT?] have too much space. This one is [UNCLEAR - VERY BIG?] - Here this, this is in a city again - - Unnh, very big - houses will be very close together. - Not very big blocks are there - About six, six acres is alright? - Each [UNCLEAR -FRONT?] is for [UNCLEAR] - Hmm. It's located 800 kilometers away - Too much! So you have to find out something about, between six and ten.

You see something like that? Something. You can. I mean, if you are on the lookout you can easily find out - no problem. [UNCLEAR] - Hamilton - very far away? - Ah.. no Mother, it is just across the river. - That's where - You know, I listened you out. I think, I can get you on a 845 plane out of Auckland - Oh, that's very good! - which will get You in early in the, You know, mid-morning. - Yes, that's alright!

That's very good. - This is where all the very rich people live. [UNCLEAR] - Is it? But you can live there - why not? [UNCLEAR - YOU ARE NO LESS?] - It's on the way to the airport, Mother; It's very nice. - It's a very big block of land - Let's see, let's see - Half acre. - See it's very good is the area is, square meter is not much. Two thousand - two thousand is not much - Less than half an acre. - Oh, I see - is the area - Yes.

What is it? How much you have here? - Four bedrooms. - Won't work out - Yes Mother. - Need not go to a place which has got few this things but this is very far away, you said. - Yes Mother - 800 kilometers - Hmm. You have to find out, I mean, I don't know where - which is the closer and which is not but, you see, there're so many every Saturday. Just go through them and see for yourself whatever you like. These are all for - uh.. this is all for auctions, I think. - Yes.

Why do they auction it? - The more expensive ones will be auctioned. - Oh! - So the agents make more money. This, this kind of thing you should see always because you can renovate them and they are better houses always. - And I don't know which place is - what is this one is? - This is [UNCLEAR], this is across the river - but that is 5 kilometers from here - Hmm - It's again a very expensive area Unnh. It will be, it is [ UNCLEAR] in the, it will be. You should try to make it a little out; Also good for children. You see, the atmosphere in the city is not so good for their lungs and things - it's also difficult Where is Cashmere Place?

I don't know that one, Mother. - It is not so expensive. - The houses don't seem to be very expensive here, I don't see - This is the cheapest place in Australia - Which one? - Brisbane is cheapest place in Australia. - Then you should, you should have, then why not? Very cheap! Here they have not written how much [UNCLEAR] - Three bedroom - Three bedroom - [UNCLEAR] You can find out. Children should be out. I don't like them to stay in the cities - it's not good. They get all the bad things of the city only - Here lots of nice places are near the - [UNCLEAR] - near the ocean.

[UNCLEAR - YEAH?] It's quite good; I don't know how many bedrooms [UNCLEAR] - Three bedrooms [UNCLEAR] - Three bedrooms and study - You will find out - it's not difficult. If it's for renovation, it will be cheaper and we all can renovate it, you see. - Yes, Mother. It's simple. You should sit down nicely with about five, six newspapers and give it to everyone. Let them sit down and find out for themselves [UNCLEAR] and if it is for renovation, nothing like it because then you can renovate it the way you like - and lots of things you can do with it - and get together to do the work - Yes, that's a very good idea. - Yeah - When you live there, [UNCLEAR] renovating it also Better now? Little ice has cured you - just imagine. Doctors will not tell you what is - virus, this, that all kinds of stories.

Then I take your leave now, I leave it to you people. Sit down properly and just find out because making it will be difficult. You are getting them so cheap just now, maybe, that the prices are low - why not buy one? Then we'll see about it later. Alright, may God bless you! - This chair is a rocking chair. - You want [UNCLEAR]
