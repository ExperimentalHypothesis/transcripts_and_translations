1986-0126 Public Program, Madras, India

[Introduction by Yogi]

Friends, aspirants, seekers and fellows Sahaja Yogis, it is my great privilege today, coming to this meeting, and present our divine Mother to you. Shri Mataji is not new to Madras, as you all know. But at our persistent request, Mother has been kind enough to visit Madras last year, a couple of times; and the year before, in the month of October, Mother was [UNCLEAR] Madras to public meetings. But these public meetings were held in the southern part of the city, and there was a claim from the seekers, the seekers friends of mine, and those [UNCLEAR] in Sahaja yoga, that I am giving the opportunity only to the people of the South to hear our Mother and not those in the North or in the other parts of Madras. So, this time, I requested your kind president, Mrs. Kulbari, to give me the opportunity of using this hall. So in spite of the earlier bookings, and grateful to you, for having agreed to spare this hall. But I assure you, that now that our divine Mother has agreed to [UNCLEAR] as well for this hall and the further bookings, will be immense and the prosperity which we’re expecting to [UNCLEAR] out of this hall, to clear even our standing, if I may say so, need not be worried about at all. [UNCLEAR]

Now, coming that [UNCLEAR] program, many people have asked me, because the past two, three years, when we have been trying to introduce Sahaja yoga intensely, in the city, that they are not able to understand fully the input of Sahaja yoga, of Kundalini yoga. We have with us today, Dr. Warren Reeves, who has been in Sahaja yoga for quite some time and who has been wandering all over the world along with Mother. If I tell you a little of Mother’s programs and how She is keeping pace with the World Right Organization and the demands of Sahaja Yogis all over the world to have Her in their centers, I assure you that no human being can’t keep pace with the number of programs She covers, She manages, She covers and the Realization sessions She organizes, it is something human beings [UNCLEAR].

So, Dr. Reeves is here and I had requested him to give you a brief talk on the intricacies of Sahaja yoga. Don’t worry, it is not an intricate subject, it is a very simply subject; people imagine that Sahaja yoga is an intricate thing before they know what it is all about. So, people like us, who have started Sahaja yoga, who had come into contact with Shri Mataji, and had got Her Grace, we know; we have been agnostics, [UNCLEAR] and desperate on not knowing where to go exactly. Now, after coming to Sahaja yoga, we know our directions, we are able to experience our Spirit, we are aware of what we are; we are able to experience the vibrated awareness. We understand why we are here for; we are able to, at least see, and weigh where we are, where we have been from and why and the welfare of it.

And I’m sure these things are very simple, in Sahaja yoga; it is not at all complicated and Dr. Reeves will talk and put it in a lecture, and before you hear Shri Mataji, I know that all of you are anxious, we are waiting Shri Mataji, but I think you should hear Dr. Reeves also, before Mother, because...before you hear Dr. Reeves, I’d like to tell you who Dr. Reeves have been. He was a high commissioner for Australia and in the Middle East. He was a doctor, practicing osteopathy, and he was rewarded for [UNCLEAR] Humanity,

Shri Mataji: Three times PHD.

Indian yogi: Three times PHD. And now, he is devoting all his time to the spreading of Sahaja yoga. And why Mother wants to propagate Sahaja Yoga? Why all Sahaja Yogis want to propagate Sahaja Yoga and get all of the [UNCLEAR] into the boundless wealth of Sahaja yoga? This thing you’ll understand once you are in it, and why you should be in it. I hope that Dr. Reeves will follow me; afterwards, of course, you will have the divine speech of our divine Mother. And the practice, [UNCLEAR] Mother puts people into Realization. You are all sitting here and you are interested, and I think that please try to stick onto the seats till the end of the program, and I assure you will not regret it. Thank you very much.

Dr. Reeves: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (doing Namaskar). To all my friends here in Madras, and all the new seekers who are coming on this most auspicious occasion to get your Self-realization, I want to say two very simple things: one is, it’s my great privilege to be in the presence of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and to accompany Her on many of our travels and doing this great work of Sahaja Yoga in opening up the possibility of the collective evolution that it’s taking place on this Earth, and to be in any small small way, as a seeker, who is fond of Truth, identified with this great Being is my greatest privilege and I humbly bow before that privilege. The second thing is that, whatever may be my pasts in terms of performance, achievement, academic, results, whatever it may be, it cannot hold the single candle to the Truth which I have found. The truth of the Spirit; the Truth that we have been seeking for ages; the Truth that is manifested when our central nervous system itself becomes enlightened by the light of the Spirit. This is what we, as seekers, have been seeking for so many past lives, and at the feet of our divine Mother, we achieve it. Just imagine the Grace of God, how much It must be overflowing at this time! We have all been reading for lifetime after lifetime how to achieve it, what we have to do; we have been meditating, we have been learning so many things; we have been trying by our efforts, by our karmas; we have been doing our bhakti; just seeking that oneness with God. And how fortunate we are, that we’ve been born at this time, to achieve our Self-realization. 

Whatever great PHDs, or whatever great commissions I might have had, these are nothing compared with the achievement of Self-realization, the fulfilling achievement of Selfrealization. Because in the light of that, you become a complete person, you become a person who is totally integrated; become! You achieve something; not talked about it, not read about it, not sing songs about it, but you achieve that state which is divine. Now in Sahaja Yoga, when we get our Self-realization, we have taken the first major step, we have entered into the Kingdom of God. And as we enter into the Kingdom of God, we then begin that final process of our ascent, fully to be one with the Divine.

Shri Mataji has taken Her birth as Adi Shakti Sakshat, the Holy Spirit in the Christian tradition. She has therefore come as the One who is not only the Redeemer, but gives us our Self-realization, but as the One who consoles us, who gives us the Knowledge, the secret Knowledge, which has been withheld, I must tell you, for thousands of years. Knowledge, the Vijnana [UNCLEAR] workings about subtle body; Knowledge of how the Kundalini works out, Knowledge of our central nervous system becomes enlightened and we get our Atma Sakshatkar. As if that is not enough to get your Realization and to be consoled, that She comforts because She is the Redeemer, the Consoler and the Comforter. As Lord Jesus Christ predicted, and who is the Comforter, the One who heals our illness, our physical illness and our mental illness, and our spiritual illness. The illnesses that are within us, and make us less than other people. 

So the first thing that happens after Self-Realization is that we get comforted; all our pain, all our suffering, all the hurts that we might have suffered through going this way and that way in our seeking, get healed. And you begin to enjoy Life, you begin to laugh a lot, you begin to become like a little child, and that comforting of the Mother starts to manifest.

And this is what I would say to the people of Madras, because you people are so of quality, because your people are so steeped in tradition, because you have so much good conditioning, and because you are very very dharmic people, don’t miss the point: knowledge, in terms of book knowledge, knowledge in terms of the shastras, knowledge in terms of going to discuss after discuss is not the point. The point is the achievement, the achievement of Self-realization. I have stayed in this city and I admire and respect so many of you, I’ve met many of you. And yet I find some, certain tendency here for us to intellectualize a little, to go back to the scriptures of 1 000, 2 000, 3 000 years ago, but we are here now, and God is, in His overflowing Grace, through the blessings of the Divine Mother, giving us our Self-realization now. It was promised, and we have to achieve it. So, what we have to do is to be a little bit humble and quite practical about the whole thing. Whatever we have not achieved up to this point, we have to say that: we have not achieved, and now we have to get it. If I, with my background, can feel that Love, can feel that Peace, [UNCLEAR] about the Peace being helpful, that Peace we can begin to feel within ourselves, that Love we can begin to feel within ourselves, that collectivity we can begin to feel, not just as brothers and sisters, but being truly threaded on the same sutra that is the sutra of our Divine Mother, which is in fact the beautiful thread which is the Kundalini Herself. All these things we can achieve as an achievement. I invite you to study carefully the words that She has to say, but more particularly I invite you to experience at the end of the session the Self-realization, the experience of the Love of God which She has to give you. To all the people who are so kindly come tonight, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our Divine Mother, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

[Speech by Shri Mataji]

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

Now, as Dr. Warren has told you, which is very true that the Truth has to be known through your central nervous system; that means what is said in the Vedas, the word Veda. The word Veda means what you know on your central nervous system; Veda does not mean what you know through your brains or mental scheme, it does not mean that. Because this mind is a limited place, or you can say a limited organ. And you have to know the unlimited for which you have to be triggered into that space where you can feel on your hands the allpervading power of Chaitanya. This is the same thing as Buddha, the word...you see Sanskrit language is so precise, is so correct, so accurate, that you have to get your Buddha, Buddh moksha [UNCLEAR]. It is not just a mental concept, or a mental idea, or a mental belief. It cannot be also just an emotional way. It is that you have to become a saint. 

Now, the idea of a saint we have is absolutely again mental. According to us, the saint should be running away from family, running away from cities, running away from everything, as if he was frightened of everything. If he is a saint, why should he worry as to what sort of family he has, or what sort of house he has bought, or what sort of surroundings he has; a saint is like a lotus, he emerges out of the mud - pankajahat, as they call it – and the fragrance of that lotus spreads in that dirty mud and covers every area, making it absolutely fragrant, that is the saint. So, the first idea about the saint is that he should leave his family, leave this, run away, like a run away person, all the time on the run. That must be the criminal who is running away. What is the saint afraid of? Of nothing! That’s what we know in our country, we have had saint, and saints, and saints and all these saints have been family people. We know of Raja Janaka, who was called as Vaidehi, and his daughter, Shri Sita, was called as Vaidehi. Vaidehi means though he lives in this world as a king, though he had to move about like a king, still he was a vaidehi and you know the story of Nachiketa, I need not to tell you that, thanks God! In England, I had to give lectures and lectures, explaining who Nachiketa was and who Raja Janaka was. But you know the story. So, these superficial things of wearing a karshaya, or something, if you think that is the way a saint is to be recognized, is a wrong idea. Of course, you can wear karshaya, there is no harm, but by that you may not become a saint; it is an outward thing.

So what has to happen to become a saint, that you should become aware of the Chaitanya around you. There is an all-pervading power of God, it is said so. Now, the scientists will say “how are we to believe that there is all-pervading power of God?” Actually, whatever is dead, that’s what the scientists are trying to find out. Can they produce any living flower? From the living, they may create another living. They only live with the dead. The One who is creating thousands and thousands of these flowers, who is He? At the right time, He uses the Svetambara pragya to create at different rituals(?) [UNCLEAR] all these flowers, the Nature, and everything works so spontaneously, with such regulation. Then, when you start this believing in God, with ego of yours, you cannot come back to a point where to see that there has to be a power to do all these things. 

So, now in Madras, or anywhere in India, we are on the watch of people getting into the trap, because they have seen the elders going to the temple, doing all kinds of things, and achieving nothing. They go to a temple, still they tell lies, they get angry, they have all the defects that are possible under the sun. Sometimes, they are even worse than others, worse than the people who go to the temple. So, people start finding out what’s the matter. How can these people be called as something dharmic, when they are so horrid? The younger generation today is really driven to another madness which I call as the westerning madness. The reason is they have no roots at all, so they are driven into a new madness where the children feel that it’s good sensation to be in that kind of a mad mood. In the West, on the contrary, people are discovering that all this madness is a fool’s gold.

We have lost something, we have to get it back and we have to achieve it. So, I would like to quote to you here Shri Krishna’s sayings when He says that the roots are in the brain, and the Tree of Awareness grows downward. So those people who grow with that downward movement go to Adhogati; that’s what has happening in the Western world; you cannot imagine sitting in Madras, or even in Bombay, what sort of horrible state they have reached, they are in hell, there is hell there. They may have money, but money in Hell, in filth; they are completely lost people. To add to that, we have sent all fake gurus there, to make money, alright. They might also make money. So this kind of movement downward leads you to Adhogati. And this Adhogati, we think it is a progress; supposing somebody is falling from top down below, if he is a stupid fool he can think that “I am progressing because I’m moving”, but he is going to Hell, and that what is to be seen when you go abroad and see for yourself.

So, what is the thing is that we have to go to Urdhwagati, to find the roots, and these roots are in this country. The roots of the true Knowledge are in this country. They are with us. Adi Shankaracharya has written so many treaties about Aatmo Buddha. But who is trying to find the Aatmobuddh? First of all, we have to question ourselves: why do we follow human dharma? Why should we have Dharma? Dharma we should have because we must have balance. I do not mean any kind of a [UNCLEAR], like a Hindu religion, or a Muslim religion, no! Dharma means a balance, a santoorlaad (?)[UNCLEAR]. We must have the balance within ourselves, moderation within ourselves. Why? Because we have to ascent. Any aeroplane, say for example, that doesn’t have a balance, cannot ascent. In the same way, any human being who doesn’t have a balance cannot ascent. 

The Kundalini also, which people know about, because Markandeya has talked about it, though it was a good [UNCLEAR] for lots of things, as you have got Suchindra, Suchindra because Indra got His realization. But He did not give up His position as Indra, only thing in Antar Yoga, He got Realization. So this Realization has to work out within ourselves, not without, because it is a living process; this also we don’t understand that we have become human beings out of amoeba stage through a living process. Now the living process is the simplest of all, cannot be difficult; say for example, if you want to sprout a seed, you don’t go to university to read about it, you just plant it in the Mother Earth, and it sprouts, it is built-in; because the whole thing is built-in within yourself, you have to just start it. It is like a car which is presented to you, absolutely first class, you have to just enlighten it. What is so difficult, you need not to know all the parts of the car, or you need not to know all the theory about it. In the same way, supposing you have to put on the light, you just say “press the button”, and the light is on. You need not to know all that headache, you need not, it’s all done! It’s so simplest done. But then if you want to repair that light, then you might need it, and it’s much easier once you have got the light within yourself to see.

So, today Sahaja Yoga is that Kundalini rises, and gives you Realization. Simplest done. Now, when It rises and pierces through the fontanel bone area, the first thing happens to you, that you become thoughtlessly aware, means Nivichara Samadhi. You can feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost as Adi Shankaracharya describes: “saliilam, saliilam”. When the cool breeze is coming out of your own head, nobody has to certify you. You have the experiences, for that you cannot do anything, it just works out, automatically, you are all ready for that. What do you have to do? Nothing!

Then afterwards, you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands, and then afterwards you feel the vibrations around you. That’s how you get the buddha on your central nervous system. Now, medical science have appreciated only one point, that these are all sympathetic endings, all these five, six and seven chakras, and that they get enlightened; finished! When they get enlightened, on these chakras you can feel what’s wrong with others, and what’s wrong with you. If somebody like Me can decode it and tell you if this chakra is catching means what, if this chakra is catching means what, and how to cure it and how to improve it, you are a Sahaja yogi.

We go reading books after books, going to the dictionary, going to this and that, even you don’t have to walk one pace for that. You get it where you are sitting down. The reason is today the time has come. It’s a blossom time. In those days, when people used to give Realization, like Raja Janaka, only one or two flowers were on the tree. Today, so many seekers are born, because of Kali Yuga. It’s promised that in Kali Yuga, people will become “bhrant”, confused; and in that confusion, they will receive their Realization. So, the time has come, you are born at the right fortunate time, you have to get your Realization.

As a result of that, once you get Realization, what happens? These centers that we have got within us, - six centers through which the Kundalini pierces through and the one center which is below that -, are responsible, on the gross physical sense, for all your working. So, they work on the gross self and you get your diseases cured. Today only there was a lady with us, she has got cancer and all her glands were swollen from here to here (Shri Mataji shows the right side of Her neck). And she was so shy of that, that she was covering her head and sitting like this. So she sat down next to Me, I asked her “just put your left hand towards me and right hand towards the Mother Earth; the Mother Earth will take the problem.” Just that. After, say 15 minutes or so, I asked her “how are you feeling?” She said: “I don’t know how I am feeling”. I said: “alright, remove all her covering”. All the glands have vanished into thin air. Then you might say: “Mother, how it has happened?” We can explain to you, we can tell you, how it has happened, you cannot [UNCLEAR]. But first and foremost thing is to get to your Atma Sakshatkara (Self-Realization), to your Atmo Buddha, that’s the first thing. That’s why Buddha didn’t talk about God, they say He was a nirishwara, but not that, because He thought if you talk of God, then people just think “oh, to going to God is the best way, so let’s just start doing all other things but Atma Sakshat”. So, He said you must get your Self-Realization. You must get your Atmo Buddha. Without that, you are not complete. 

So, in the evolutionary process, now you are becoming human beings, you are to be triggered into that area, which we call as the Kingdom of God. Now the scientists are halved today: few of them who said there is no God, but most of the [UNCLEAR] was like Einstein, or Newton and all that...Einstein himself has said that “the theory of Relativity dawned upon me, suddenly from somewhere unknown”. So, one has to understand that science, or anything that they may deny something because they do not know, they are not honest. If they do not know anything, they have to say “we do not know, but we have to find it.” But the ancient rishis and munis and seers, - tishtas -, have been telling us that you have to get your Atmo Buddha, better get your Atmo Buddhas, do you mean to say that all of them were liars? They were telling us all lies?

Nowadays, also there are some books I’m told which say that Kundalini gives you trouble, can be very troublesome, this that; this all a recent non sense when German fellow has written such a big book, - these Germans have no brains at all, you see. They don’t even believe in the Mother, they have all fatherland, and what they have done, what is there to learn from these Germans? He has written such a big book, where he said that Kundalini is in the stomach; from where he got this knowledge, [UNCLEAR]? And he said that when the Kundalini is awakened, you get this kind of thing and that kind of a thing. Nothing happens like that, nothing of the kind; it is a whole misconception done by people who do not have the right to do the Kundalini awakening, those who do not have that [UNCLEAR, sounds like Pariit prota], that [UNCLEAR]. Kundalini Sakshat is your mother, She is your individual mother, when you were born by your physical mother, She took upon the pains upon Herself, She never gave you any trouble. In the same way, when you are getting realized, maybe I might get little trouble, not you. And so just to escape with the Truth, one might find out some sort of an excuse from all these books that have come out. 

Only in these hundred years otherwise, Gyaneshwara has written about Kundalini, clearly, but in the Maharashtra, the people told that “no, you are not supposed to read the sixth chapter because it is with Kundalini, better keep it shut”, because they don’t know anything about it. And even if I went to the Gyaneshwara Mandir, and we said we have to meditate, they said “no meditation”; I said “why?”; they said “no, you can do dindi, you see in Maharashtra they think is that you go on playing like this “Vitthala, Vitthala, Vitthala!”, like, that’s mad. That’s all. I said “what about this Gyaneshwara whose statue you have put here? Did He do dindi?” – “No, you see, he was great; we have to just do dindi.” I said “He meditated. Today, you have put him in a statue. How can I talk to you? I cannot talk to you.

Such blindness we have in religion, - dharmandhata -, that those who are coming in the next generation are going to see through their intelligence and are going to deny God, are going to deny everything that is so great in our country. We do so much adharma by the western ways have lost the real essence of this great knowledge in this country that through Kundalini you can get your Realization. But we have some intellectuals now who are stupidly analyzing even Adi Shankaracharya, by saying that Soundarya Lahiri was not a written by Him, because He wrote Vivekachudamani. He once have written Vivekachudamani must be fed up with their intellectuals and must have said tell them the Truth, better worship the Mother.

But intellectuals do not want to accept because they want to have mental feeds, you see, like acrobatic performances. And they don’t want to accept it, why go above [UNCLEAR]? Krishna has said “Yogakshema Vahamyaham”: when you take your yoga, you get kshema. He never said with “Kshema yoga” you could have set it. So, you first take your Yoga, and then Kshema will come. Without that, you are singing to God without connection with Him, He won’t listen to you, there is no telephone connection; like in India, whom do you talk to and you spoil your telephone much more. In the same way, this connection must be established, which is spontaneous, it is a living process for which you cannot pay, which is the simplest Sahaja. Sahaja means “born with you”, Saha0ja, “ja” means “born”. “Born with you” is the right to become a yogi, and yogi doesn’t mean that he wears just a few rudrakshas and move about in the whole world, nude. It doesn’t mean that. Yogi means a person who has become one with God, who has become one with the Divine power and whose hands are emitting the Divine power. And that is what is the lakśa, is the end of your search of Truth. The Truth that is expressed through your nervous system, that has to happen, unless and until that happens, our talk about God, religion, is absurd. Christ has said you have to be born again, alright. So, what? Somebody will come and put a little water on your head and will say “alright, now you have become officially”. We accept it, it is all artificial, it is not real, take it from Me, it is not real at all. In the same way, we say “you are a dvijaha”, means you are born again. So, they will give you a yajnopavita with big ceremony, have big food and all that, and they will say “now, you have become a brahmane”. You cannot. A brahmane is to be born realized or is to be made realized...who should know the Brahman, His Brahman-Shakti which is pervading. So under wrong conditions, we are working. Under wrong conceptions, we are living. Let us reach to God first of all, all of us, whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, nothing matters. You all have got Kundalini intact within you, especially in India. This knowledge is in this country and you have to find it out; it is your responsibility now, to get your spirituality to understand the Spirit which resides in your heart; and to propagate Realization into others, which is a thing which actualizes, it is not a lecture, it is a becoming. You have to become, this is the point, and which is the easiest thing; a child also can get his Realization and can work it out.

But by saying it is difficult, you are just escaping the whole thing, this palayanam one, running away. Why do you escape your hitha, this is the benevolence that you are going to get. Physically, you feel alright; mentally, you feel alright; emotionally, you feel alright; materially you get Kshema; and you feel the peace and all the great talks of having peace within yourself, peace marches, peace this thing, is fulfilled. Even Marx when he said that the whole world should be such that there should be no state. Why didn’t he say he was going to do it? His state is much more powerful than other people. He could not do it; if you go to Russia, you will be surprised: it is just the other way round. You cannot get rid of the state; they are under the complete bondage of the state there. Then the so-called democracy, when you see it, you call it demonocracy; because they are abandoned people. In the name of Christ, they call themselves Christians; when Christ has said one should not have adultery eyes, and they have the dirtiest eyes that you could think of. 

In the Hindu religion, it is said that everybody has this Atma. How can we have casts system? We cannot have a casts system. And this casts system has come to us to bring mistakes. Today only, when they were singing, that with the [UNCLEAR] name, the name taken the other way round, like “mara, mara, mara” as Valmiki was told by Narada. He got his Realization. That means Valmiki, they described Him as a person who was a dacoit, he was such a patakin, a sinner, and He got His Realization. He was not a brahmin. He has written Ramayana which is read today. What about Vyasa? Vyasa, as you know very well, was a son of a fisherwoman and an illegitimate son. All these things deliberately God has done to show us that your birth doesn’t determine your cast; it’s the jaati. Jaati is the aptitude that you have. We say “Yaa Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Jaati Rupena Samsthitha”. This is an innate thing. It’s an innate thing. You cannot get it out of birth. A father, mother, could be good, but the children could be very rakshasi; it can happen. Also in the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of Gîta, it is said that asuri vidya will take over, too much of asuri vidya like trantricas, like people are going to some agurus, pay money for it, people are practicing all kinds of black magic; all these things are already written that this must take over. And you cannot get out of it unless and until you are protected by your ascent, by your Realization. So, this is the age which either you will go to the highest or you will go to the lowest. You have to decide now where you want to go.

After Realization, Knowledge becomes your own, your Self gets all the knowledge. For example, the Saints who were described before were the people who had knowledge, who had not been to universities or anything, like Tukarama or Namadeva from Maharashtra. If you read their books they are ordinary people; Namadeva was just a tailor. But now the intellectuals, in Maharashtra also, who think knowing God themselves, as we call them shishtas, they think that Namadeva, the one who went to Pendjab, who was very much respected by Nanaka, was not the same tailor. For them, he was just a tailor [UNCLEAR]. But seeing how Namadeva talked to Gora Khumbar, who was just a potter, so he goes to see the potter saint. So, the poetry he has written is so beautiful: “Nirgunacha bheti, aalo sagunashi”. In English language, you know, is a difficult one to translate, but it means: I have come to meet the Formless (Nirguna) but here it is in Saguna as Gora Kumbhar. But to all the rest of the people, he is just a kumbhar, good for nothing. And when these saints were tortured, we were [UNCLEAR], we didn’t bother; we could not do anything because we did not know what saint [UNCLEAR]. But today, we better get our Realization and know the truth about all these swayambhus, about all the things that are in this country which are so precious, and so evident, so clear-cut, that you will be able to justify all that is said, not only by Indian saints, by Westerner saints, by Chinese saints, by other saints who have lived all over the world. You can explain them very well, because you will know the Truth is one, with the essence is the one. Maybe to do some ayachat it acted differently. Mohammed Sahib was Maha-medha. He was Dattatreya Himself! But in those days, in a horrible place like that, He had to do all these things and these Arabs who have no much sense about spirituality, he had to work it out that way.

What about us? We have heard so much of spirituality. Where are we lost? What are we doing? What are we asking? First, you ask for Realization, and the rest will follow. Everything will follow. So, as a Mother, I will tell you each and everything in an open manner. I am not going to hide anything or play tricks with you as Shri Krishna did. I tell you straightforward everything which cannot be misinterpreted. First of all, you must have your Aatmobuddha, that is very good. May God bless you and give you Sumati to get your Realization. May God bless you.

If you have any question, you can ask it.

I will request you to ask me questions now. Last time when I came, as usual, I think there was somebody, some Christian gentleman who came here and I was wearing some gold bangles I have not bought from his money, it’s my husband’s money. And he published about a [UNCLEAR] wearing gold bangles. So, I am not a sannyasi by any chance. I am a married woman, and my husband is highly placed, and I come from a rich family, and whatever is suitable for my family I have to do it; I mean in any case if I am Devi, I have to wear ornaments. So, he just saw such a superficial thing, maybe he doesn’t know a Devi, he doesn’t know a Devi, so I excuse him, but this kind of stupid superficial observation misleads people. Our media suffers from that superficiality. So, we are deep people, Indians are deep people, we are not like Westerners who just see how many cups there were, how many things were there; they see the depth and we should see the depth of a person. May I have a question, if you have. But when I go, then you should not start saying something. One by one. Now, the gentleman behind. Alright, you sit down for one minute. Let him ask a question.

[Inaudible question asked by the gentleman]

Shri Mataji: A very good question. I’ve understood it. It’s a very good question. You are a doctor? No...(laugh) I wish you were a doctor. Now, I tell you how [UNCLEAR]. You see, if you go to the basics, basics of the chakras, - they are the basics -, from there comes all the energy, - alright? -, for all our autonomous nervous system. Now, if you have the knowledge of the chakras, say supposing, I develop a pain here (Shri Mataji shows the tip of the right forefinger) and I say that you are suffering from your throat trouble. You say “yes, I am suffering Mother”. The reason is this finger if it starts burning, it is the vishuddhi; it is Shri Krishna’s finger. It’s here (Shri Mataji points the hollow of the throat with Her forefinger). That means there is some problem here. There are seven chakras at this side (right hand) and seven chakras at this side (left hand). If it is on the left hand side, then it is an emotional problem; if it is on the right hand side, it is a physical or mental problem. Now, somebody suffering from ego; a doctor cannot find out, but we can. If somebody is suffering from ego, then this finger (right ring finger) starts burning; this one. Now, there are many children I saw today who are suffering from over-activity. Over-activity is a problem of ego, imbalance of the ego, which doctors cannot correct; we can correct it, because we can give them the balance. So the diagnosis is on your own fingertips. Mohammed Sahib said: “at the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak.”

This gentleman now; what does he say?

A yogi (repeating): Is pranayama necessary to awaken Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: No, not at all, nothing. No effort, effortless. No kriya needed; in akriya. On the contrary, if you have done pranayama, you might get into imbalances. Today, we had somebody who had gone in pranayama, and he had a problem on the hamsa chakra. Pranayama is only one side, right side; it’s prana. Left side is manas shakti. So, there can be imbalance, very much imbalance, due to pranayama. Not at all necessary, nothing is to be done. As long as you are a human being, Kundalini can be raised.

[Inaudible question asked by another person]

Shri Mataji: That, I am going to do it. That’s a good question about sadhaka. [UNCLEAR] happy to know that; I do that myself; why do you do it? You see you have to just sprout the seed. If I am like the Mother Earth, I can sprout it. And then, you can do it also. It just grows, you don’t have to do anything; it just grows under your eyes. I’ll make you up. May God bless you. Very good question.

[Inaudible question asked by another person]

Shri Mataji: Could you stand up as I can’t hear you, sir?

[The person repeat the question...still unclear]

Shri Mataji: When the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area, sometimes you might get heat if you have too much heat in the body, you see, like a chimney opens out your brahmarandra, then you might feel a little heat coming out; and then you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand.

[Inaudible question]

Shri Mataji: I beg you pardon?

A yogi: He asks if there is any electric current in the body.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. That’s wrong, that’s not circuitry. That should never happen. That’s not circuitry. Never! If you feel that, it’s a short-circuit. It’s serious. Maybe, sometimes people are possessed, then they get also funny feelings, but mostly it doesn’t happen; if it is electrical, it’s horrible. It means your sympathetic nervous system is excited. That means Shri Ganesha is angry with you. Very serious; you should never feel electric currents.

It’s very soothing, very relaxing. It’s cooling, it’s beautiful. In Madras, you will enjoy more because it’s so hot here.

[Inaudible question]

Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

I can’t hear you, sir, I’m sorry.

[Inaudible question]

Shri Mataji: It is little detrimental, it doesn’t matter, but it can be corrected. Everything can be corrected.

[Inaudible question]

Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

A yogi: You said that pranayama is harmful...

Shri Mataji: Not harmful, but it gives you an imbalance. You see, because... I tell you, please sit down, I will just explain to you and you will understand why I say so. See that Patanjali spoke it fully that there is a hathayoga. You see, it is samagra, it is integrated; some people have to do pranayama; some people have to do bhaktiyog; it depends on the personality. Alright? Everybody shouId not do pranayama. It is like taking all the medicines to them. Even the style of pranayama depends on the prakriti of the person. It’s to be done under a guru who is a Sadguru, who knows everything about Kundalini. But in Sahaja Yoga, the one which is Sahaja, what we do, somehow, despite the fact you have done pranayama, you have done bhakti yoga, all kinds of extreme things you have done, whatever big mistakes you have been committed, we forget about it. First, we just raise your Kundalini, alright? In that light, you can see the problem, yourself; you become your own guru. And then if I tell you how to correct it, you correct it yourself. It is a simple thing; alright? This is how we do it. Because, now the time is very short. So, it is better I give you Realization first and then you just see for yourself and I tell you how to correct it and you can correct it. If there is any imbalance, it will be corrected. If there is not, it will be alright. But we do, we use some exercises, later on, when we find some chakras are blocked. But there is a science about it; even for mantras, there is a science. It is not just anybody gives any mantra just like that; or you can take all the pranayama, this, that, everything, like one medicine box, all [UNCLEAR]. It is indiscriminate. So, discriminately if you have any such problem, then we tell you what it is. Alright?

[Inaudible question]

Shri Mataji: you see, actually, this is what detaches you, really; that when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit comes into you. People who have been alcoholics, who have been taking drugs in the West, who came to me in a condition which we call as coma condition gave it up next day. Why? Because they become samartha, they become powerful; samartha means equal to your heart. So, this happens to you automatically, because emotionally you become so strong.

But the moral side that we have is that we call the dharmas which are within us, the 10 Commandments we can see, all these get enlightened. And you just don’t do it; like see now if there is a saint, he doesn’t steal, he doesn’t drink. You don’t have to tell him, he doesn’t drink, he just doesn’t do it because he becomes dharma. He becomes dharmateet, he doesn’t have to follow any code or anything: automatically he becomes.

Can you imagine in this country where, wherever you go, they say eat money, everybody eats money. In this country of ours, Sahaja Yogis never, never do that. But above all, you become compassionate, you become Love and you distribute, and you give and you become generous. Everybody is working in Sahaja Yoga without any payment. I, of course, don’t take any money, but no one takes money. Everybody is working it out because they think it is for the benevolence, the kalyana of everyone. So there is no money involved, nothing of the kind, just giving. Now, you might say about the missionary people, the way the missionaries work out, which is an artificial thing I personally think because when you try to help people, you develop ego, you think I have help such and such person. But when you are a Realized Soul, you don’t develop ego because it just flows and you ask a person Mother how... you ask a person “How is he? Is he alright?”, it’s working out. It is working out; he doesn’t say “I’m working out, I drop out”. You just say “it is working out, it’s coming up, it’s going down”. You become a third person; like a sakshi you become; you become, again I say you become that personality, that personality which is absolutely moral, absolutely courageous, absolutely dharmic, absolutely dynamic.

Someone in the audience: Does Sahaja yoga bring harmony in thinking, speech and action?

A yogi, repeating: Does Sahaja yoga bring harmony in thinking, speech and action?

Shri Mataji: Absolutely, absolutely. I mean in one lecture I cannot tell you how much it integrates you completely, completely integrates you, absolutely integrates you. Your speaking is the same as your work; you don’t tell lies. No, no, because you are not afraid, you are integrated. Whatever you want to do, you do it with your body, with your mind, with your heart, with your brain. There is no quarrelling, there is no struggle.

Inaudible question

Shri Mataji: Mano udaya, Rudra udaya, every udaya comes up; sarvo udaya (laughing).

Inaudible question

Shri Mataji: Alright, alright. He said “is there Mano udaya?”; I said there is Mano udaya, sarvo udaya. Alright, now...

Inaudible question

A yogi (repeating the question): Could you please explain who the observer of the light is? Is the light different from the observer?

Shri Mataji: Now, please be seated. Many people see the light. You don’t have to see the light; you become the light. Then, the light is the observer. You become the light means...what is the situation of the light? Light is...(Shri Mataji answers a question from the audience) He is asking me, I will tell you the question; the little confusing question is “whether are you the observer or the light"?”. Whatever it is...Now, I tell you what it is really. The light itself - and just please be seated -, the light, you don’t see it, you become the light. So you have the power of the light, you become the light.

Someone in the audience: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Of course, of course, of course; that’s what it is.

Same person in the audience: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji to a yogi: What is he talking about?

Same person in the audience: But I’m seeing the light?

Shri Mataji: If you see it, then you are not the light. If you are seeing the light, you are outside the light.

Same person in the audience: How to explain that I’m seeing the light?

Shri Mataji: How to explain? By the effects of it. Please sit down, I tell you what. How does the light believe that it is the light? Because of its influence, because of its behavior, because of its functioning. See, if you can feel yourself, you know your chakras, what’s wrong with you, you know yourself. If you know about others, you know about them. You are the light.

You cannot give an analogy for this because all the lights are dead; only the human light, when you become the light, you see in yourself and you see outside and you know everything in that light. But you don’t see the light, you become the light. Supposing you put bulbs in your eyes, say for example; it cannot be analyzed, you cannot put it into an analogy, but it is what happens that you become the Light. You become the Knowledge. You become! This is something, at this level, that it is to be experienced; you cannot argue it out. You see: “Na Yoge, Na Sankhyena“ it said that already. You have to experience it. Once you experience it, then you will know what it is. It is to be experienced. There is no argument about it. It is a state which you are not achieved. When you achieve it, then you will know. It’s not a mental state.

A yogi reads a written question to Shri Mataji: Does a Sahaja Yogi stop other pujas like going to Tirupati and other pujas daily?

Shri Mataji: For the Sahaja Yogis, if they are Sahaja Yogis, I’ll talk to them separately about it. You don’t have to stop going to any place. You can go everywhere you want. In Tirupati, if you go now, you will find that the Tirupati deity is giving you vibrations, is giving you cool breeze. The deity is giving you cool breeze. It’s a swayambhu. I say “swayambhu”, or say a saint might have said that it’s a swayambhu, and we all believe that it is a swayambhu; but now you will know it is a swayambhu. So, now you will know what swayambhu is, now you have discretion because you are the light. You will know who is not true, who is wrong, who is divine, who is not.

So, it is not a mental process, alright. So, it has to be achieved as an experience of your central nervous system, and your central nervous system will tell you.

In our evolutionary process, human beings have achieved a lot compared to animals. For example, if you make an animal pass through a dirty lane, it can go through; for a dog or a horse, it doesn’t matter. But a human being cannot walk through because he has developed the nose which knows; he’s got the light of the nose which tells him this is a dirty filth field, you can’t go. Eyes see the dirt in field: he can’t go. In the same way, when you become a Realized soul, you won’t go that path, no question. You’re not being tempted. You don’t go into the wrong. Because when you develop that light within you which makes you understand that this is wrong, you just don’t do it, you don’t like it. You become the Light. It is not any mental thing; like there was a gentleman who was a doctor in England; he used to drink a lot; drink, drink, drink...Then when he came to me, he gave up his drinking, overnight. But once he went to Germany, he said let’s see what happens if I drink something; because he liked a kind of wine. As soon as he took it, he started vomiting, vomiting; the stomach gave it. The stomach became Dharma. Just he couldn’t bear it and he said “Mother, I was so sick with it; then, I said Mother please forgive me” and that’s I will stop it.

You become the Light. You become the Dharma. I don’t have to tell you. That’s the best way; otherwise if you tell somebody not to do anything, he will come and beat you, these days, isn’t it? People are so aggressive. It’s better that they see for themselves. This is Mother’s trick I should say. [Shri Mataji speaks Hindi]

[Inaudible question]

Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s very good! All that I will do. That’s like a real Sadhaka. This is the second time somebody has said so. It is very good, excellent; this is the best question. That I’ll work out, don’t you worry. But on one promise, again, that once you get your Realization, you are going to settle down with it. It’s like the sprouting of a seed, you see, a little aGkura comes out. And that little sapling has to be looked after. You have to respect your Realization, you have to respect It. What I find that, as Mister [UNCLEAR] told Me, that to My one lecture, the first lecture that I gave, how many thousands came in Madras, out of them only 40 settled down; this is a very sad affair in Madras, I don’t understand. I don’t know what excuse they found to escape it. But they did. You have to establish it; unless and until you establish it, how can it work out? First, you will touch Nirvichara Samadhi, because when the Kundalini crosses over the Agnya chakra, it becomes Nirvichara, no doubt. And after that, you have to establish it in Nirvikalpa. For that about one month practice you can work it out, you can become an expert of Kundalini awakening and everything.

That’s why I’m here to give you all that it’s there. This is the promise, that you will settle down with it. It’s very Sahaj to raise the Kundalini; very, very Sahaj for Indians specially. But it’s very difficult to glue down to Indians that you have to respect It. Even then, they want Me to work for their establishment. They don’t know to work it out themselves, which is wrong. You must learn how to fly. Like we call the bird also as a dvijaa, the one born again, but when the bird comes out of the egg, it has to learn how to fly.

[Inaudible question]

A yogi (repeating): [UNCLEAR]

Shri Mataji: Now, you do the first step. You are very futuristic. You can’t walk to my stage. I want to give you everything that I have. A Mother doesn’t want anything herself, she wants to give everything that she has to her children. But how far you will take depends on you. Alright? May God bless you.

Now, let us have our Realization. A simple thing is our Realization.

Yogi: Please everyone take off your shoes now.

Shri Mataji: Please, put your shoes back, on the back side, not in front.

A yogi: Please, stretch both your hands towards Shri Mataji as if you’re asking for something...

(Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi)

Shri Mataji: Now, I have to also, side by side, teach you how to raise your own Kundalini. So, I will tell you what chakras have to be awakened in what way; which is very simple, there is nothing wrong with it, nothing special about it, nothing complicated.

So, in the heart, resides the Spirit; as simple as that. The left hand is the Iccha Shakti; right hand is the Kriya Shakti. In the Left, we have to work out the whole thing on our Iccha Shakti. The left hand should be all the time towards me. With the right hand...you have to put your hand on different chakras like on the heart; for the Guru tatwa, on the upper part of the abdomen; for the Shudha Vidya in the lower part of the abdomen. Then, you go back: you put it on the upper part of the abdomen, then on your heart, then on the Vishuddhi, on the left hand side like this; this is very important, most of you have this problem. You just hold it now; you all have this problem, and turn your head this side. From front, from front, put it from front all of you. This problem, this side; you see it comes out of the feeling that I am not good for Kundalini raising, I have got this new [UNCLEAR], I am so wrong, this and that, you know all those things. All these ideas of inferiority complex, it comes from there. Just hold it tight here. Then, you have to put your hand on your forehead, on the back here (back agnya); then, you have to stretch your hand and put this palm on top of your head, like this (turning it clockwise), and press it seven times.

Now, you have to close your eyes; don’t open your eyes, because the chitta is full inside, like Kundalini; like this is the chitta (Shri Mataji shows Her white sari) spread on the Void, and the Kundalini pushes it up and then pierces through. So, what you have to do is to keep your attention inside; close your eyes, but don’t fight with your attention. Please take down your hands, take down your hands, please.

Now, do not put any strain to yourself and take out your glasses will be alright because it helps your eyes stay closed. Because you have to keep eyes shut. Now, please close your eyes. Put your left hand towards Me, and the right heart on your heart, on the left-hand side. We are working on the left-hand side chakras. In the heart resides your Spirit.

(Addressing yogis): In Telugu also must you say something...or Tamil? Somebody should translate it in Tamil. So, those who are Tamils here can understand it.

Put the right hand on your heart, and left hand towards Me. You sit down here. Please put your right hand on your heart and left hand towards Me. Alright. Now, you have to ask Me a question, because you are a computer and this is a fundamental question and the computer answers it. Now, you ask Me a question please: “Mother, am I the Spirit?” This is to be asked three times, please. Three times; three times.

Now, this question is followed by another question because if you are your Spirit, if you are the Spirit, then you are also your own master, your own guru. So, please, put this right hand on the upper part of your stomach, on the left-hand side. Keep the left hand towards Me; and the right hand, you put it on the upper part of your stomach, on the left-hand side. Right hand; left hand towards Me. Now, here, is the guru principle within you, which is made by all the Sadgurus, by their tatwa. So, here you have to ask a question which is followed by the first because you are the Spirit. “Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?” Ask this question three times. Now, you please ask this question three times with full confidence.

Now, take this right hand down unto the lower part of your stomach, on the left-hand side; and keep the left hand towards Me. Now here, is the center of Shudha Vidya, the Knowledge that is divine, the technique that is pure. Now, here is the six-petal Swadishtana, so you have to say six times, but you have to know that I cannot cross your freedom. So, you have to ask for it by saying “Mother, please give me Shudha Vidya”. Please say it six times...Shudha Vidya...because we have asuri vidya, all kinds of vidyas; we have to have Shudha Vidya. Say this six times, please.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me and raise your right hand on the upper part of your stomach on the left-hand side, which is the Guru tatwa. Here, you have to say “Mother, I am my own master”; with full confidence, otherwise this chakra won’t open for the Kundalini to pass. You have to assume. Don’t see others, see yourself. Close your eyes.

(Someone is shouting). See, that such a man should be thrown out. He must be possessed. What’s the matter? He must be a possessed man.

A yogi: Mother, he has been shaking through your whole lecture.

Shri Mataji: Hello, he has been shaking during my lecture; please, please get up and go, you have some trouble Mister. Please get up. We will work you out tomorrow morning, you come and see Me. You come and see Me tomorrow morning; you have been shaking through out, because there is some sort of possession. Alright; please, get up and don’t disturb others. You come and see Me tomorrow, alright? I’ll work it out. Poor fellow, it must have been possessed. It’s alright, don’t you worry. I’ll definitely work it out. Don’t you worry about him, don’t watch him. Now, you watch Me, let him go away. Let us continue, alright. Let us have it, let it be. I told you that if somebody is a possessed person, his possession comes out. It’s a negative force, it is nothing wrong. Please keep yourself [UNCLEAR].

A yogi: Mother, please, just to tell You that no translation is necessary, they’re doing everything correctly.

Shri Mataji: Alright, alright. That’s kind of you. Yes, but you cannot open the eyes, so I was thinking that maybe...alright, we’ll not translate it, if you can follow it, then it’s alright. That’s should be much better, direct. And don’t get upset about this gentleman, as I told you when people are possessed, they become like this, they start shouting and things...but it has nothing to do, I mean they don’t feel hurt but their spirit in them starts shouting; it’s alright, we had only one person here, it doesn’t matter. Don’t you worry about that. Don’t think about it, because you are not like that, why to worry about somebody? Alright.

So now, we put our right hand on the upper part of the stomach and press it hard. This is the guru principle. Now, here we say, at this guru principle...we close our eyes, and say “Mother, I am my own master”; 10 times. Please, say it 10 times.

Now, you raise your right hand on the heart again, on the left-hand side. Put your left hand towards Me; put both your feet on the ground, in parallel. Do not put your head down or up, keep it straight. Here, you have to say, with full confidence: “Mother, I am the Spirit”; 12 times. “I am the Atma”; 12 times. With full confidence in yourself.

Now, we have to know that God is the Ocean of Love and Blessings, but above all He is the Ocean of Forgiveness. So, you cannot commit any mistake that He cannot forgive. You have to forgive yourself by saying “Mother, I am not guilty”. But put your hand, as I showed you, in the corner of your neck. Press it hard; right hand, right hand. And left hand towards Me, and now say “Mother, I am not guilty”; say it 16 times, because it is Krishna’s chakra, so you have to say 16 times “Mother, I am not guilty”. 16 times.

Now, raise your right hand on top of your forehead, across, and press it on both the sides. When we get headache, how we press it on both the sides. Now here, on this chakra, Agnya chakra here, you have to say “Mother, I forgive everyone”; this, you have to say it from your heart. How many times is not the point, but how...from your heart. Because, you sometimes believe that it is difficult to say such a thing. I have to tell you, whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything; but by saying this, at least you don’t play into the hands of others. So, just say “Mother, I forgive everyone”. Just say it from your heart. “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

Now, take your hand on the back side of your head and hold it tight, and throw your head backwards. Keep the left hand towards Me. Here, don’t feel guilty, but just say “Oh God, if I made any mistake, please forgive Me”. But don’t feel guilty; you have not to feel guilty. Say it from your heart, don’t feel guilty at all; please don’t feel guilty. Let God decide, you don’t decide about yourself.

Now, raise your right hand by stretching it on top of your fontanel bone area, on the taalu part, just in the center; and put the left hand towards Me and press it hard, which you have to move seven times. Here also, I cannot cross your freedom. So, you have to say “Mother, please give me my Self-realization”. I cannot force you. Put it on your head, on top of your head, on the taalu. Stretch your hand and put it on your taalu. Press it hard and move it seven times by saying so: “Mother, please give me my Realization”.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into the micro.)

Now, take down your right hand slowly; both the hands. Now, please open your eyes. Please open your eyes. Take down your hands. Now, watch Me without thinking. Now, you can put your right hand towards Me, and left hand on top of your head about four inches or so, bending your head a little bit. Just see that there is a cool breeze coming out of your head; just bend it down. Bend your head a little bit, and see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your taalu. Let it be four inches up; just put it four inches above.

Now, change your hand; put your left hand towards Me and see with the right hand. Just see, just [UNCLEAR]. Now, change it over again. Put your left hand and see if you are getting the cool breeze on top of your head.

Raise both the hands and ask a question, putting your head back: “Mother, is this the cool breeze, the chaitanya? Is this the Brahman Shakti? Is this the all-pervading Power of God? Ask three times.

Now, bring down your hands, please; bring down your hands, please. Now see, are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands? Are you feeling the cool breeze out of your head? Those who are feeling the cool breeze in the head or in the hands, raise both of your hands.

So many of them!

Most of you have felt it. 90 % people have felt the cool breeze; and there is no thought in your mind, if you watch it.

Tomorrow again, I’ll explain to you...no, the day after tomorrow, I will explain to you what the Kundalini is, what the chakras are. And it is very simple, you didn’t have to do anything whatsoever. As you have done today, if you want, you can do it in the house. Don’t argue it out, you cannot argue it out. It is beyond your mind. Those who have not got Realization, we’ll get it later on, or if you are interested, you can go on the sides and these boys can give you Realization. They’ll work it out, and you’ll get your Realization and then go home.

You just don’t have to think about it. That’s the main thing. It is beyond thinking; it is beyond your mind. So, keep to [UNCLEAR], go back home, and take rest. I hope to see you the day after tomorrow. Those who have got Realization, we will give them my photograph the day after tomorrow, and they will be told how to meditate; and you have got a good center here, which you must come every Sunday. Just now it is not just in the middle of the city, but we hope to start something like that. So, tomorrow, we are having a music program, for which you are all cordially invited.

Those who have not felt it, you can go on the other side, and the people can give you Realization; those who have not felt it. It is better to get It now...On the other side.

Shri Mataji addresses someone in the audience: Have you not felt it? Have you felt the cool breeze?

Those who have not felt it, then go on this side, and talk to these boys, and they will give you the Realization. Please, take it, and then go home. Don’t go without Realization.

A yogi: All the ladies please come on the left side, and the gents on the right side.
