Dear Rajkunwar,

I have learned that your health is not good. The treatment for Jaundice is as follows: Boil tender leaves of radish and mix sugar candy(rock sugar) with that water. Drink this water repeatedly. Do not drink any other water. Drink water after vibrating.

Secondly, take mustard oil in a copper or brass bowl and move it in a clockwise direction with your fingers (Nabhi chakra finger) or with all your fingers. One hand, either left or right, should be placed towards the photo. Check your hands alternatively and keep the hand that feels lighter towards the photo. The oil will slowly turn thick yellow. Do not dump this oil into water, but take it far away and burn it. Doing this two or three times you will feel better. Avoid using oil and ghee in your food completely. Also, take vibrations on the Nabhi and liver. Keep the other hand towards the photo.

I am very concerned about you. Please send a letter soon. Also, invoke Vishnu. Bow down and offer prayers by taking names of Dattatreya and his incarnations.

Chotuâ€™s letter has come from Delhi. I will send him a reply.

Convey Diwali's auspicious blessings to everyone in Dhule.

Always remembering you, your mother, Nirmala.
