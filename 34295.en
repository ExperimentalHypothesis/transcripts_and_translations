Letter

To whomsoever it may concern.

I want to state that nobody has any right on my body, without my permission I should not be treated by any doctor vidya or any other person.

Specially my husband and my family members should not at all have any say in my sickness.

No one has to admit me in any hospital.

Even Sahaja Yogis can not admit me in the hospital or treat me or arrange any doctor for treatment â€“ for me.

I want to declare that my family should never never admit me in the hospital. Specially my husband has no right over my body and any advice from him should not be accepted at all. In short I do not want to be admitted in any hospital by anyone.

Before my death I will write what is to be done with my body.
