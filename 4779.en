Mahashivaratri Puja, Mumbai, India, 1987-02-27

Sahaj Yoga was known to me all along. It is a unique knowledge with which I was born. It was not so easy to reveal it & I wanted to find out how to reveal it.

First of all I thought that the seventh chakra must be opened, which I did, on the 5th of May. It is a secret in a way. Formerly, the. Brahma Chaitanya was A-Vyakta. It was not manifested. It was not expressed by itself. And so the people who managed to reach

Brahma Chaitanya somehow, by attaining 'Realisation', said - 'It was Nirakar Ka Guna. You are like a drop that gets dissolved in the ocean'.

No one could say, explain or tell people anything more about it. The great incarnations also who came out of this great Ocean of Brahma-Chaitanya, tried their best to share it with the best available followers (which were very few) & introduce them to this Brahm-Chaitanya. But because the Brahm-Chaitanya was not in a Vyakta form, these incarnations got dissolved in it.

Like Gyaneshwara took his Samadhi. People said that he cannot talk. It has to be experienced. So very few people got to swallow it. Nobody could actualise the experience by feeling on their finger tips, or feel it on their senses, or on their minds, or even understand it with their intellect. So it was a big problem. They all tried & prepared a ground for it.

Now I have come as the Incarnation of the Brahm-Chaitanyaas a whole. The sea of the Nirakar has now become a big cloud (Saakar). It has taken a form. Those who came before were all a part-and-parcel of it. Now the whole has come. This cloud has rain water. The rain water is nourishing the minds of the people. Gradually they are brought to a level where their Kundalinis have risen. They have got their Realisation and now gradually they are feeling everything on their senses, their finger tips. This is the reason why nobody has talked about Vibrations so clearly. They managed to talk. about Chaitanya Lahiri. This was so because of its A-Vyakt form. It was only a state. A state to be enjoyed only in that State with no manifestation in the gross. In that State they became beyond Temptations, beyond Temper etc. That is proof before us. How they did it, what was this Brahm-Chaitanya? -- they could not show its Pratyaksha form. What they could show was only through Similies or through some Parabole.

This is what I have achieved-Its Pratyaksha form. The complete form of the Brahm-Chaitanya I have brought from the sea. So now, I do not allow you to get dissolve in it. I have put it in the form of a big Ghata(Matka). In that, you are smaller matkas. In other words, I have taken you all in my body as small cells, nourishing you, looking after you, cleansing you & working it out. But I am Maha-Maya. So I have to work very slowly, gradually, and at the right time and right point.

When the seventh chakra was opened, all the chakras came to your Sahasrara, and so I could manage all your chakras & all your deities. Any deity you ask and you get the vibrations. So that proves that I am the Brahm-Chaitanya.

The Brahm-Chaitanya is the Adi-Shakti and Sada-Shiva is also in my heart. But since I am so much humanised, it is not so easy to find it out. If you tell this to Modern human-beings, they will not understand. It can only be told to Sahaj Yogis, because they will understand. To bear this Truth is so difficult. These days it is difficult to bear money, leave alone that, even to bear ones own position. They become so shaky. So for them to bear the fact that I encompass all the incarnations is too difficult to bear.

One day I went to Aurangabad, where a boy told me that Brahm-Chaitanya is beyond feeling and non-feeling. He had read about it in some book. I told him it was true, but he should forget about it and just feel it. It was then that. I decided to tell about it to a few people. You see, the right time also had to come before I disclosed it. All other religions have so far been segmented and non-integrated. Now the whole integration has come. I can now explain Christ, Mohomad Saab and others, because they are all. a part & parcel of the whole, which is Brahm Chaitanya.

Do not talk about me to the Scientists. Just tell them that this is a Unique Method that has come. Though it is a little difficult to understand, yet it has happened and we have seen it for ourselves. Like that you tell them. If you talk about me, they will be shocked. Maximum you can tell them, that - 'this knowledge was brought out by Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi, by which the Kundalini could be arisen now, how she has managed it, we do not know. It is probably a secret. Put the whole thing on me.

Now you understand? Can you say-how does a seed sprout? By putting it in the Mother earth. So you say, that by putting everything to Mataji, our seed has sprouted. It is a living process and we have seen it for ourselves.

So far nobody has been able to give Realisation to others. May be only one or two have given Realisation to others. Most people have achieved it by the process of cleansing. Example: Budha got his Realisation by thorough cleansing. Brahm-Chaitanya crawled inside him because he asked for it, genuinely wanted it & prayed for it and was, therefore, cleansed by it. But again, he went into its state. There was no communication about it thereafter. This is what is in the collective now. This collective working is now happening because this state has started expressing itself.

Supposing you discover electricity, and you keep it to yourself & not talk about it to anybody, then how will anyone know about it? It is not that the great Saints did not want to express it. But there was no communication then. It is just like it someone has no eyes to see, then whom are you going to show to? or talk to? There was no one to appreciate and absorb that state at that time.

Those who did achieve realisation, their Sahasraras got opened, but they got lost in it. The whole experience remained to be individual and not collective. Now that is over. Now it is collective. Everything has to be collective at a point.

Even to reach this point, testing was done by sending little bit feelers at a time. Ultimately Christ got crucification. So was Mohommsaab, Nanak & Tukaram. See how they were treated. They were coming from Vaikuntha and see how they were treated. Things just did not work out then.

I know all beyond the Vaikuntha, but I have not revealed it so far. It wilI be slowly revealed by me, because people have not been prepared yet to become capable of absorbing it. You seem it is like the preparation of a Khichidi. It is yet under preparation. So let it cook. You are all in it. The quality of people being built up now- is equivalent to the choicest of the handful of disciples of the past Prophets. now & here everyone is destined to come along, slowly and steadily. All those who will now fall into this great Handi of the Supreme Cook will be well prepared in it. Rest, who opt to remain out, will be left out. It is all beyond time. Each to his own capability to achieve. Just at it is difficult to say how long will one learn to ride a Bicycle, or become a C.A., or a Doctor. Some may take very little time, while others very long.

The bondage of time is created by man himself. In reality this body has no timing. Time dimension has been created by man by his habitation. With the formation of habits, the KAAL or time bondage is created. When there is no habit, there is no time dimension.

With Sahaj-Yoga, lots of Habits leave you. But this takes time too. You must therefore never justify your habits if you want to rid them. It is with justification that habits stay. If in one lifetime you can achieve Self-Realisation, and you reach the point of having begun to loose your habits, then in that very lifetime, it is possible for you to acquire that so called state. In the event that you may happen to remain halt-baked during the process of one life time, then you will come back to complete your achievement. This is how Sahaj-Yoga will now work out for some time. This is now the last Judgement. During the process of the revelations in Sahaj-Yoga, when I still see people behave in the opposite direction, I feel awesome. I continue to have such bad experience at times, but then such people leave Sahaj Yoga. This happens, but you must not get discouraged. You must go on working towards it, putting in your very best efforts.

Always remain in the centre. Do not worry about your growth in Sahaj. Once you are in the centre, growth is automatic. It is already being nourished by me. Daily you move from left to right. In your Habits, you move towards the left, while in Ambitions, you move towards the right. To seat me in your Heart, is a Bhav or a feeling. So just as you develop Habits on the left side, you must practice to have that habit like Bhav for me in your hearts. If, so easily, you can acquire your habits, then why not this Beautiful Bhav? All this is nothing but a change in Bhav. After all Habits are easy to remove, being just a mere state of mind.

Once you have established MY Bhav in you, it takes position in your entire body and carries itself through eternity. Depends on how much you are using yourself to it. It is just like if you put lots of smoke on your room, then all the mosquitoes will run away. So it depends on how much of ME you have filled in your hearts.

The question that now arises is, that how does one come to stablise the state of MY bhav in your hearts? The ANSWER is - 'stability comes by constantly stopping your own attention or Chitta'. Always do Chitta nirodh. Just like you go out and you see something, you must conciously stop your Chitta from going towards it. It comes with practice. Pull it inside. This is called detachment. Remember, the contact outside, or Samparka is always through the Chitta. Watch where it goes all the time. Always ask yourself, ''Where is my Chitta''?

Actually, Chitta is segregated within us as our consciousness as well as our awareness. When our consciousness becomes one with our awareness, it assumes the form of Vibratory awareness, which balances you. The balancing keeps you in the Centre. The moment your chitta goes out in the wrong direction, immediately you feel the heat on your senses. That is how the all-pervading Power works and grows within you.

All our habits and Samskaras crumple out Brain formation and appear as convolutions in the brain. When all these convolutions open up, new spaces are created in the brain, having more absorption power. The crumpled brain subtly opens. This is how the connection with the Divinity is made,

Scientists, basically, have to be stunned. Like I went to a Medical Institute, and I told them about the Para-Sympathetic nervous system. They got stunned. The mode of action of Stiponilan Adrenaline, they cannot explain. But we can. Now take carbon. If you see it from the left side, you can see the right side and vice-versa. On the left Side, you can see the figure of Carbon, as in form of Swastic. On the right Side it looks like the Omkara. If you see upward, from down below, it looks like a Cross. That is a fact. Now to stun them. It is like you have to accept a Hypothesis. that there exists an all pervading power above the Human Brain. This is. the only hypothesis. The human brain is in the form of a Pyramid. The Param-Chaitanya, or all pervading power, is coming from all sides, and is striking the brain of a Featus (soon after its formation).

What actually happens is, that at the apex of this pyramidical brain, the Param-Chaitanya passes unhindered and settles down the Spine, in the inverted Triangular bone area, at the base, in three and a half Coils, as the Kundalini Shakti. In the process, it leaves its mark Called the ''Vaccum channel" in the spine. Now the Param-Chaitanya, hitting on the sides of the triangular brain, has to permeate the Grey and the White matter. These have their own Densities and so, governed by the physics Laws of Refraction, the Chaitanya refracts from right to left. This is also called the Prismatic refraction effect. This phenomena exists mostly for Human brains and not so much in animals.

During the refraction process, the Human attention is pulled out to both the sides and is driven in the outward direction. Both the attention and the refracted Chaitanya cross at the Agnya Chakra from both sides on their way out, as a result of this pull, an additional force, called the resultant force, is created. Now the theory of Parallelogram of forces (of physics) comes into play. The resultant force is divided into two parts, each being at a 90-degree angle to the other, on both the left as well as the right side. The resultant force acts in the centre of its two counter parts. one part creates the left and the right Sympathetic Channel of the Featus, by pushing its way down the body. The other part pushes its way out through the senses, dragging with it the Human attention both to the left and the right. The second part is also known as the action in the outer world. From the outer world, this action brings back a reaction. (another famous law of Physics). The path followed by the action 6c reaction is the same. On the left side this reaction builds one's Conditionings, while on the right side, it builds the Ego.

In short, our Chitta, accompanied by the resultant Brahma-Chaitanya's living force, that went to the outer world, collected a reaction and brought back with it a conditioning I rom the left, thereby forming the Manasa or the mind. Both the action & reaction pass through both the Agnya & Vishuddhi chakras. The Chitta, being dispersed in nature, has the ability to flow from the whole body. The reaction of the left is the desire element, the potential of which gives birth to the Ida nadi on the lei t sympathetic channel. Similarly, the reaction of the right is the action element, the potention of which forms the Pingala nadi. The overflow of the Ida nadi forms a Ballon-like cloud at the back of the Agnya chakra called the Super-Ego. While the overflow of the Pingala nadi forms a similar cloud in front of the Agnya chakra, called the Ego. The Agnya remains directly in-between these two balloons. The front of the Agnya is controlled by the Pituitary of the brain, while the back is controlled by the Pennial.

When the Kundalini enters the Agnya chakra, she enlightens it. Then Christ within you is enlightened or awakened. He sucks both these baloons of the Ego ck the Super-Ego, and th,e whole Agnya chakra opens. That is why Christ died for our sins. There is simultaneous opening of the Sahasrara. I saw the Sahasrara of the Virat open. It was like tons of flame. Just like when you disect the human brain, its cross section looks like petals or like flames. In the centre of it, it looks like a yellow hole. The opening of the Sahasrara is sudden. With a bang it opens. How can I explain, - it gives the effect of one telescope into another. Normally, with the opening of the Agnya and the Vishuddi, the Ego land the Super-Ego get sucked in. Mind is Super-Ego. Ahamkara is Ego. Out soul or Atman is surrounded by all the five Elements plus their casual expression, with the Kundalini on the perifery. The elements are mainly the Earth and Water, while their casual is just jyot matra.

When self-Realisation takes place, the Deities are awakened, and the chakras are nourished and freshened. They open out and start releasing energies. At the Pithas, (representative points of the chakras on our brain) all actions begin against each related chakra. Coordination at both levels starts and all chakras get integrated. Take an example of your Mind. It wants to do something. Your body - it wants to do something else. Thirdly, your intellect - it wants to do something else. There is no integration. On Realisation, all three become one.

Take another example of a piece of cloth. It represents the attention. Before realisation, it is spread out in all directions. Now take a finger and poke the cloth in the centre from the bottom and raise it upwards. What happens? The cloth is pulled lip to a point ck in the process, it just wraps or falls around the finger. h the same way, when the Kundalini rises, it pokes the attention, raises it to the Sahasrara, where it gets enlightened by the light of the Brahma-Chaitanya. It then just wraps and falls in line with the Kundalini's path on the Sushumna Nadi in the centre. What has actually happened is, that on realisation, our Chitta is pulled inside from the outer mundane world. The Chitta is thereby enlightened. This is the so-called state. But in reality, we humans are slaves of our habits. We, out of sheer habit, do not allow our Chitta to stay put in that state permanently. Actually the chitta should not go out. Here is a simple situation that I find myself to be in with you. I am putting you in the Boat to sail off, but you are resisting my help by constantly sticking your one foot in the water. Your attention is on frivolous things, you see, out of your habit, you put out your leg, knowing very well, I am sitting inside to sail you through. I also happen to see that your leg may be swallowed anytime by an alligator, but you, in your own habits, are blind enough not to notice the alligator. Now, can you imagine my plight? Imagine how I feel?

That is why I say - do Satsang - meaning, spend time with other Sahaj-Yogis, with the object of keeping your attention in the Centre. It is very important to constantly keep your attention in the centre. With realisation, our let t and right Nadis relax off upon receipt of Divine energy. Due to release of tension, the Chakras open out still further. It is a cycle. More Kundalini fibres can then rise and so on. At this stage the attention develops a quality to remain in the centre. You can then direct it ou to perform a particular task, and after achieving it, without any reaction, it occupies its position in the centre. It has, by now, achieved the quality of not getting attached to anything.

In my case it is different. If my attention is on you, I will take all your problems into myself and cleanse it, and myself suffer. This, I will do only if I want to. Now, Sahaj Yogis, ( have to fix, because I have put them indiscriminately into my body. So I have to suffer. The Sahaj-Yogis themselves are just barometric in this regard. They cannot suffer the way I do. May be a little bit, because whatever they suck, goes into the vast ocean.

Now the study of the fifth dimension of matter is going on in Russia-the study of Bioplasma. This is completely a right sided activity. Each human being has his own Aura and depending on his changing Gunas, the colour represented by that Guna or Aura changes. What do you give bandhans to? To your Auras so as to protect it. Only matter can have an Aura. So it is materialistic. The fifth dimension is actually a microscopic or a photographic dimension. So when you see some lights in my photographs, it is one form of an Aiira. You see Brahm-Chaitanya has got its own light. This is only visible to me. Some people can also see it when their Agnya is bad. They can see it from outside.

The principle is that when you are away I ron it, you can see it, but when you are in it, then what can you see?

Thoughtless awareness comes when your Kundalini crosses the Agnya Chakra-when there is no thought. It happens by control. Slowly it becomes a part of you and encompasses your whole body. It becomes a state. This is doubtless Awareness. You become the Brahm Chaitanya or the state.

At this stage, you all need to work for me and not just land up in that state & get into a Samadhi. I have achieved it for you without giving it to you. Then why do you ask for it? You must know that you are there and there is no doubt about it.

This is now the final game. In reality this state is very easy and spontaneous to achieve, but yet I would like you to work for it & try for it. When you feel like achieving this state right now and for your own individual self, then I would say that you are being selfish and in a way you are becoming an escapist. You have to first become collective. Otherwise on an individual basis you will get lost in the Nirakar and you will not even be able to see ME. You see, you will be in that state you will be dissolved in the ocean. So evolving from the ocean and dissolving in it is not anything unique or great. But to become a cloud from the ocean and then soak everyone with your Rain water would surely be a unique achievement. This is my aim and also my game. Just as every game has an aim, so has mine.

To stay in the Centre, become Sharanagat. Say "you are everything Mother, so you do everything". It is complete surrender.

For a Scientific mind, you have to give them this whole vidya in bits. If their cup is small you cannot fill more than the capacity it can take. So have patience. You cannot give them the whole ocean now. Remem`Der that Science is only a woe part of the Whole. First create a craving for Sahaja in them by introducing it to them. Once they come, then watch them. Remember your time? The same thing happened with each one of you. At first experienced it then craved more and more for it, very progressively. This process is also Scientific.

In the mundane, when you work to earn money, you will encounter the Maya. Just remember that you are earning for ME. That's all. Go ahead and earn as much as you can. This I am only talking from the materialistic point of view.

People who come into Sahaja Yoga through you Sahaj-Yogis come better than through ME. You see, with me, they tend to get entangled in my Maya. See, I am nobody in my human form as far as the new comers are concerned.
