Today we have gathered here to worship Shiva.

Many hymns have been written about Shiva and the Great Shiva is said to have various methods (UNCLEAR - sacramental?) and deeds/work done. The biggest blessing of Shiva is that because of Him we all are enunciated/placed here today. Because of Him our existence is, that's why we should thank That Shiva who gave us a vision/sight towards Him. The manifestation of this material life is supported by Brahma, Ganesha and Vishnu. But its destination is that of Shiva as well, moving towards Whom we must first acquire the qualities of Shiva. His foremost quality is forgiveness. He is nothing but forgiveness, but which path should we take to achieve that forgiveness? Misuse, He forgave many demons and gave blessings to them but it was misused by the demons. Then those demons are reborn with their demonic (UNCLEAR) and they... We should emulate His forgiveness and not His (UNCLEAR).

When people come to Sahaja Yoga, they do not understand how much enlightenment and love they have received. One must first love. When love completely blossoms in a person, then detachment /neutrality comes in him. When a person loves everything, loves everyone, he fills them all within himself, but he is not absorbed/engrossed by anyone. As is the case with ordinary people, they get engrossed in small things by saying, 'This is mine, this is mine.' They will fight for it, lose their self-respect for it, will do all kinds of such activities for it which will later on make them feel ashamed. But the person who loves everything remains untouched by it. Means he will always keep blessing that thing. He will always have a worthy feeling towards it. He will think that that person is being (UNCLEAR - harmed?)

through me. Like a father spoils his child, then he does not love him, he harms him. The biggest rule is that love should be benevolent. If love is harming the child, then it is not love. It should be known that Shiva has powers that flow within us, and therefore His love is limitless/boundless. It is true that He loved demons as well. But He has a third eye which can reduce all the demons to ashes at once. You don't have such an eye. So in the beginning, love simple and easy going people. Then love the difficult people.

Loving monsters/demons is not a beneficial thing. You should be indifferent to demons. Even to fight with them - they are demons after all. So getting angry with them will only increase your ego. Therefore, your loving sight towards them should be such that you remain indifferent. Or you should have a type of compassion for them, "Oh, what is it, they are devils." And you are sitting in the Kingdom, and these people are demons. When this feeling awakens within you, then the principle of Shiva will be awakened. Shiva is the embodiment of love, He is love personified and there should be surrender in love, devotion and knowledge. Suppose you have devotion towards someone, you believe in someone and you get to know that this man is very wicked and he takes a lot of our money, he has troubled me in such and such a way, then all your love will be lost for him, you will lose your faith in him.

Thus love is generated from knowledge and devotion as well. Means in knowledge you know what the truth is, and when you do devotion towards that truth, knowing that truth when you have faith in it, that is, when you are devoted in the light of that Truth, then you know what love is. Loving any human being blindly, having blind love for anyone, is not acceptable to Sahaja Yoga. For Me too, until you have gained/received something, why do you come on My feet. When you have not known anything then it's not proper for you to believe in Me. You must first know what I am, you must first fully attain/receive that Truth, you must know it within yourself in your consciousness, and then your devotion will have some meaning. Otherwise, by saying, ‘Mataji, Mataji, Mataji,’ Mataji will not have any relationship/connection with you. But you will only be connected when you know what is the Truth about Mataji. Touch the feet only after knowing that truth. Even now when we went there, a lady came on My feet.

There is no benefit from that. You don't know anything about Me, you don't understand anything (UNCLEAR) then why My (UNCLEAR) In our Maharashtra, people are suffering from a disease of giving them My darshan/sight. If I don't allow them to see Me, then it's all over, then they think that I have made them completely a pauper. This is not the case. Eligibility to take darshan or being entitled to go somewhere does not mean that I have challenged your ego or I have defied your ego. This simply means that the faith to receive the Darshan has not yet been awakened in you. This means that you might have devotion towards Mataji, but you haven't really known Her truly, so why touch Her feet? By doing this you can correct/clear this question once for all that you will never touch the feet of other Gurus; First know the truth about them. See their few disciples, what is their behaviour, then know this. So what is called Shraddha(Devotion), that is Shiva's presence in the devotees; He resides in the devotees in the form of devotion and then it should be said, now how much balance there is in this faith - but very few people have the balance of the principle of Shiva.

Because He is The Unseen, He has never incarnated, after knowing Him (UNCLEAR) So more than that, what is called its joy, because how else should one know That One desirous thing? The reflection of the Spirit in our heart is Shiva Himself. And the reflection of this Spirit gradually manifests itself. Now you have found the Spirit in the form of Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga you have known, verified and witnessed your Shiva principle. After understanding that Truth you have now reached this state, that with faith and the support of this Truth, you can do anything. But as soon as your faith, as your sight became subtle, As soon as you were able to know (UNCLEAR - possible? ), in the same way Shiva's powers also got manifested. So, at the time when the principle had to be sacrificed or explained, Shiva came to our void in the form of a Guru (UNCLEAR). In today's time we should know that Shiva is the Rudra.

One of His powers is Rudra Shakti. Out of them, eleven Rudras are active/functional today. Those who will work against Sahaja Yoga will be affected by this Rudra. Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and show demonic tendencies will be affected by this Ekadasha Rudra. The first thing you know is that Ekadasa Rudra is very predominant in Cancer. Similarly, those people who come to Sahaja Yoga and then quarrel amongst themselves, create animosity in one another, will show enmity, or will not have the awareness of Sahaja Yoga, will not participate in it, or those who do not come to the collective, the power of Ekadasha will be activated for them. As much as it is helpful to you, to the same extent Shiva's power is destructive for you. Because Shiva's power is helpful to you it will take you to a deeper level, it will fill you with love and the greatest thing, it will bring joy to your life, It will fill very pore of yours with joy; every moment of yours will be blissful. This is the power of Shiva, but when you go against Shiva, betray Shiva, then this very power it will give you the antidote(Maarak), which we call centripetal and centrifugal force. So the power which has attracted you, the power that has made you (UNCLEAR) will leave you and you will become (UNCLEAR).

So as you progress, accordingly you should stick to Sahaja Yoga very closely. Sahaja Yoga has its doors open for all kinds of people. Whoever wants can come into this. This does not mean that every person is a Sahaja Yogi later on. Any person can walk around with the label of Sahaja Yoga saying he is a Sahaja Yogi. Because here one does not get any certificate that one is a Sahaja Yogi. But we should know that when we have come to Sahaja Yoga, to what extent are we ready to give something for it. Here I always tell the people of Bombay that you people do not pay attention to Bombay, you have become so ill This puja should be done very nearby (UNCLEAR), means who will spend money to go from here to there, "Mother, please come to our house to do the puja" Then Shiv Shakti will shower on you and when the Power of Shiv affects you then you will be surprised that, "Oh, we do Sahaja Yoga in our homes," "We worship the Devi then why are we in trouble." You cannot even go to the centre, then how will you go to Alibag from here. The people from Bombay don't move at all.

Nobody moves in Bombay. Whatever they are stuck in, now have to go to the office, work, earn money, this and that, wife and kids, this, that and that, all that is important and Sahaja Yoga is not important. In the same way, for Shiva also you will become secondary and then gradually you will become tertiary, no one knows in which state you may go. There should be a firm grip on the Shiva tattva; one should completely clinch on to it. You must get completely engrossed into it and with all your heart be one with it. The principle of Shiva is the most important of all things. Only when we know/realize this, then the worship of Shivaratri has any meaning. As they said in this, "Mother, it has become very cold here, it has never been this cold before," This means that the principle of Shiva is important. Egoists will run after this, will run after that and many of you will get temptations in Sahaja Yoga. Many people will get money immediately, will get jobs, this will happen, that will happen, they will have children, even after doing all sorts of things in the world if you give into temptation and (UNCLEAR) Then the principle of Shiva will immediately withdraw Itself and will take away your life too.

That is why today I'm telling you all (UNCLEAR) and this is a sign/signal for you, is a warning, that those who have come to Sahaja Yoga, should keep their life clean, be calm in their behavior, and keep their minds steady. This is very important. If your attention is wandering here and there, here and there, procrastinating, then you need to fix your attention in meditation. By being unified, by being collective, establish the principle of Shiva within yourself, pray and the third thing is to give the highest importance to the principle of Shiva and get rid of the devil in you, leave the anger. It doesn't mean that a gentleman went from here, fell in love with everything, and after going (UNCLEAR), "Mother, I just love them." Among all this, Shiva is deeply embedded within you, so that you get the discretion - you meditate, this has to be done, whether this thing is right or not, this should be done or not. If you don't know, you can ask Me. "So I thought that this is to be done," So, we cannot do anything about it, because the principle of Shiva is so fierce, so awful/dreadful, (UNCLEAR), which I'm always afraid of, that My children have not yet grown up, have yet not improved properly, have not come on the proper path, and if Lord Shiva's eyes open somehow, then only (UNCLEAR - burn?) the doomsday thus it's absolutely necessary that we become very good children. This happens especially that if Shiva is watching, leave those alone who are bad, evil.

Don't ask them (UNCLEAR) ask yourself, correct yourself, improve yourself. Every time this question comes up that Sahaja Yoga has done a lot for us, what have we done for Sahaja Yoga? Every day at least one principle of the [UNCLEAR - earth?] should be kept on Sahaj Yoga. and if nothing else could be done then at least one principle of the [UNCLEAR - earth?] for Sahaja Yoga. So when a person thinks in this way that, what has he done for Sahaja Yoga, what has he done for the collective, so Shiva will also feel that, "Yes, the children are growing up, let them flourish and move forward." One should be very cautious about this principle of Shiva. Until you discover the essence(principle) of the Spirit, you are in ignorance. Even after having the knowledge, if you touch a snake, it will bite you.

You must never have heard of a snake biting an animal - a bull or a cow because the snake is in bondage and the cow is also in bondage. Scorpions never bite. Horses never bite cows, cows never bite horses. What is the reason? That they are all animals in bondage and you are a human being today. There is so much difference, you are Yogis(saints), from a human being you have become a Yogi. Even after becoming a yogi, you do not give up your ego, you do not know your greatness, you do not know your kingship. You are seated here, there is no decorum in you, there is no greatness in you, how are you a Sahaja Yogi. Even now you misbehave for a few pennies, you keep on fussing over small things. Leaving aside all these small things, leaving aside all the petty things, there should be expansiveness in the Shiva principle.

One must attain His vastness, and in that vastness one thinks that Shiva is the ocean. He is the ocean and we have to dissolve in that ocean and become as vast as that ocean. Until that expansiveness comes into our character, it will be very wrong to call ourselves Sahaj Yogisccwc. Whenever I Myself look at it, I too sometimes feel guilty that why have I given love to Sahaj Yogi. When will the lotus' blossom in this mud or will I be left sitting with the worms? Therefore every Sahaja Yogi has to take a pledge today that, 'With our Shiva principle we will spread that fragrance in every part of our body so that the whole world will say that Sahaja Yogis are people to be seen.' They steal, they cheat, they do mischief, they boss around, and do all kinds of disgraceful things of the world, such cannot be Yogis. Either they can be Namdev, Kabir or Tukaram or any other such saints who may have been there, - Would they ever have done anything wrong in their life? Could they ever do it? So even now whatever you people want (UNCLEAR) give up all and stand up in complete detachment in the Shiva principle.

Just as your Mother's name is Nirmal, I bless you all to become Nirmal. And till now you have understood everything from Me, but this eye of Shri Shiva which is within Me, it hits with a tremendous force, so be careful, be cautious. May God give you all wisdom and with these vibrations may you know what is good and what is bad. “I felt, I thought, “This language does not suit Sahaja Yogis.” Today the worship of Shiva will be very short; It does not require much. But the fact is that Shiva, Who is eternal and infinite, is seated within us. After awakening Him ask Him for just one thing, there is just request for one thing that we should always remain engrossed in Shiva, "And we, let us just be one with You, in Your essence, in Your company, in Your love, in Your ideals," "May we thrive in Your vastness/expansiveness and remain grounded in joy." This is what you have to ask/request from Him and this will fill you with joy. May God grant wisdom to all of you!
