[Text of audio 1, 2 and 4]

Shri Mataji: It's all right for you to say, because he is just there, you see. He was just to be ripen, he came to Me, he got it. [clapping with hand].
Sahaja Yogi: I found he got it very easily. The minute I saw your photograph, I gave [inaudible] I mean, I was [inaudible] TM.
Shri Mataji: Really? Then, I wish all of them have even that much of you it will work out.
Sahaja Yogi: Well, since then, I spoke about [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Yeh.
Sahaja Yogi: And within twenty-four hours, [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Hmm.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s a sudden wave of vibrations [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: We have to save them. You see, with TM, my attention is very much there, very much there. Last time we solved the problem of that “Divine Light.” That “Divine Light” is out now. Only have his brother, you see. I went to Geneva. I wanted to see TM also, but he, you see, it was starting raining and all that, in night, we didn’t go. We could have gone up to that place, it would have been better, but doesn’t matter. So, he, the brother, drove Me down to the center in Geneva, and said, "He is the one, you know". I said, "All right, I put a bandhan". Within a week’s time, he’s out in jail now. And now fourteen years, thank God. [Inaudible] started. So, all this works out this way. So, my attention is very much on TM these days, very much. And, if it works out? So, here we are.
Sahaja Yogi: He must have been and with your attention, it must work.
Shri Mataji: Very much.
Sahaja Yogi: Here. Some weeks ago, it started. [Inaudible conversation]

Shri Mataji: Good. It’s working through awareness. If it breaks, it will break completely. You’ll see that. Because this is a bubble, this is just a bubble, it will go out. So happy about it! And this should happen. Actually, you see, even going of this Divine Life Center business, you see, I do not know how many of them will come to Sahaja Yoga.
That kind of- It’s better that it works through your awareness, so that you come to Me. Otherwise you see that kind of a what you call, a removal of one person may not. They may still come to Sahaja Yoga, I don’t know because Gregoire was saying he’s going to start something in Geneva also. Let’s see if that works out.
Sahaja Yogi: Through our future job of [inaudible] would it be a quite strong position [inaudible] Through our job we are [inaudible] much more powerful when we get a certain level.
Shri Mataji: Angel level.
Sahaja Yogi: In our job and we are mixed with other in Switzerland. And little by little, people we are working with, we attract them to Sahaja Yoga and every one of us-
Shri Mataji: Yes, I mean your life will show that, see that you are different. Now, Douglas. Look at Douglas. If Douglas has impressed you, so you can imagine. Douglas can tell you what was his condition when he came. He was in a mess because the poor fellow has been really tortured and troubled very much. He was in a mess, absolutely in a mess when he came to Me, ask him. He’ll tell you. And now he’s achieved this power that shows how great he is. See, he was in a complete mess, you don’t know.
my husband is very much impressed by Douglas too for one reason. He says, “Whatever You tell him, he just obeys. He never questions.”
I said, “That’s something.”
He says, “He never feels bad.”
So, you see, one day he was watching TV for a long time. I said, “Douglas, not good for your eyes. See your eyes are very bad.” Immediately he stopped it, went away.
He said, “He didn’t even take a second to think about it and he just stopped it and went away.” “So,” he said, “but what makes him do that?”
I said, “Only thing he knows is that I do it for his good, absolute good. That’s why. He said, “What he never feels bad, whatever you tell him.” He’s quite surprised at this.

That’s the surrendering, I would say. The way he has achieved that power. That’s the only way really, to be very frank. That’s how you achieve that. No other way but that.

Now. Who’s is this one? Yours. Are you better? You did how many years? Five years or eight years for Hatha Yoga? Eight years?
Sahaja Yogi: 5 years.
Shri Mataji: Five years?
Shri Mataji: It’s five years?
Sahaja Yogis: Yes. It’s five years.
Shri Mataji: This is another problem, you see, this Hatha Yoga. Very wrong.
Sahaja Yogi: Hatha Yoga.
Shri Mataji: Yes, absolutely wrong. You know, this is not Hatha Yoga. Where is “ha” and where is “tha” in it? Nothing.
Sahaja Yogi: I’m vegetarian [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Oh God! Now I am going to stop it absolutely, anybody is- Yesterday, you see, that old lady was saying, “Mother, is it wrong to be now vegetarian?” I said, “I don’t mean that!” But those who are not vegetarians, why you should force them to be vegetarians? I can understand, you see, certain meats are not good. Like, I would say horses’ meat, you see, is not good. When it’s a big thing, you know, even cows’ meat is very bad for the teeth, you see. That’s how you lose your teeth here. If I eat the cow’s meat, immediately, by mistake also, I get a swelling on my [inaudible] complete vibrations start flowing from my teeth here. All my gums become swollen up. Sometimes even my lips have, when I’ve, when I take the soup becomes thickened like that. So, that means that there is something in the fibre that is bad for your teeth which spoils or may be vibrations-wise. I do not know whatever it is. But the horses’ meat is the worst of all. Now they eat horses’ meat, even in Yugoslavia?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I live in Yugoslavia.
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s why I must tell you that in Yugoslavia, I went, and ate a salami, and I said, “What’s the matter with this salami?” So, they told Me.
“What you make out of it?”
They said, “Horses.”
“Horses’ meat?” [laughing] Oh, I couldn’t understand it. And they eat anything. Like in China they eat snakes, you see. There was a man, head of the Scientific Research Institute, and he said, “You know why we are so brainy?”
I said, “Why?”
He said, “You know in my childhood I must have eaten at least fifty-six snakes.”
I said, “That’s why you are brainy?”
He said, “Yes, the serpents are very brainy people.”
I said, “But you don’t want to become a serpent.”
He said, “But, I want to become brainy.”
Shri Mataji: It is wrong to eat serpents. I mean, one should understand this. That’s how they are. This I am telling you about the South Koreans. He is a South Korean. He has eaten so many serpents, you see. And he said, “Only Americans can be all right if they start eating serpents.” See, they are all right, they are intelligent but they are not like serpents. That’s why they are failing everywhere. If they could eat serpents, they will be all right.” So, this is what is the analysis of people.
So, this horses’ meat you have to give up. All right? But you have to eat meat. No need to go to extremes. Like one side you will eat horses’ meat, tiger’s meat, every meat and on the other side you do not eat anything. You see, what am I going to do with the chicken, you tell Me? Why do you want to save them? Can I give them Realization with their two legs? What is the need to save the chicken? Save the human being.

[Conversation between Mother and Sahaja Yogis]
Shri Mataji: This is another vegetarian sitting down here. [Laughter] Still you are?
Sahaja Yogini: No, I wasn’t ever really.
Shri Mataji: So, it’s good. You have to just do it.
Sahaja Yogini: I was thinking about it when I met You but I never really did it.
Shri Mataji: I mean, they said, told Me, “Mother, we are cruel to animals.” Something like that, you see. I said, “Now, don’t worry about animals, you see. Nothing dies.” Of course, you can do it in a better way. You may not be cruel; you can do mechanically, something like that. But you have to live on them. You see, the body has to live on their meat. Part of it has to be there.
Now the other extreme of vegetarianism is, if you see, then you will know what it is. Like Jainism they have. I don’t know if you have idea of Jains we have in India. Did you meet them anywhere? No? Thank God.
See what they do is that they get all the bugs of the village in a hut. All right? And they put one Brahmin there and give him lot of money. Sometimes they give him a house also, later on, if he comes alive out of that ordeal.
And they put all that in a hut, and the Brahmin, and lock it up. And the bugs are supposed to feed them on the blood of that Brahmin. Poor fellow, you see. And then they give him a house or a money or something. And it is regarded as the greatest- what work?- charity done you see. And everybody will pile up money for that to give to the Brahmin, that he should give his blood to these bugs. Now what am I going to do with these bugs [unclear]?
All these Jains are going to become nothing but bugs, I can tell you, in next life. That’s what is due for them. Such foolish people. Why don’t they understand?

In evolution a man, human being is the highest. How much God has worked them from bug state to this state? And now to reduce the one Brahmin to a bug. See, you require at least billions of them. So, this is what it is: they have no sense of proportion, these vegetarians.

I don’t say that you should be gluttons also. I mean, you see, I must give all the sides of it because people start going to the other extreme. Like, you see, some were starving and fasting. So, I said, “In Sahaja Yoga no fasting is allowed. You are not to fast.”

In that also people have done lots of funny things. You know, this is all tantricism. It’s really surprising, fasting. If somebody tells you to fast, you must give one real boxing on his face. That’s what they deserve. It is a sign of a real devil who tells you to fast. You see, he should fast himself instead of telling everybody else to fast! It’s a horrid thing to do, is to fast this way. Of course, you can fast for your health or something, but in the name of God to fast is something so nonsensical; which I’ll tell you how it works out. I mean it’s not only silliness, but it is cruel. It’s very cruel to make people starve and make them fast, you see, when they are hungry. This way, I will tell you how they do, fasting in India.

Like these horrible Brahmins we have in India. All these so-called Brahmins, you see they are all devils. All of them are rakshasas born as Brahmins, living on in all these temples, you see. One day these temples are going to topple down on them, and they are going to be killed under these temples where they have earned money out of people. But apart from that, anything that they do is that they have started a new method of attacking people. Like, they have got fasting system. Now in the fasting system is, the day when a deity is born, that is the day they say, “You must” fast, just imagine. Now supposing a little child is born in the family in any Indian home, or any English home, or anywhere. What joy! See everybody celebrates it and makes it. Imagine the day Christ is born, you are asked to fast. I mean that is the day is of merriment. Of course, here is another extreme is that they all end up in pub. You see. [laughing].

You see, so I want you to avoid all the extremes. Because that’s not the point! What I’m trying to say is the day, say, Ganesha is born, that is the day they will fast. All right. So, you start your fasting. So, what happens, Ganesha goes mad, this is mad. Now absolutely a concrete story, I’ll give you. There was one great Sahaja Yogi from Puna and he got a prostate gland problem, and he was a great worshipper of Shri Ganesha. He came to see Me. And my prasad is channa. You must have seen channa that I give as a prasad. You don’t know? Have you got some channa today? No? Will you? All right?
Let’s have it. So, the channa, I’ve prepared also channa for you today. So, this channa, I took it out and I said, “Take my prasad.”
He looked around, because on that day you are not supposed to eat any cereals. So - not as a cereal but channa is not one of the things used for prasad. So, the other fellow said, “Mother, today he doesn’t eat anything.”
Shri Mataji: “Why?”
He said, “Because today is chaturthi, is the birth of Ganesha.”
I said, “Why? Why not on a Ganesha?”
“Because the Brahmins have said so.”
I said, “Really? Look at these devils. This is the best way to insult Ganesha.” So, I said, “You eat it today because I tell you.” And, imagine his prostrate was out. He was perfectly all right. Ganesha got awakened into him. On this point Ganesha was angry that on his birthday, instead of celebrating it, he is going into fast. So that’s why I say that these are devils. They have found out so many ways! You see, all these devils have entered into the rituals of Hinduism. And there are so many rituals in which they have put these things.
Sahaja Yogi: Christianity...
Shri Mataji: Christianity also, they have done it. But, you see, one thing about Christianity they have not done it so deliberately because perhaps they were possessed. But Indian ones are real ones, you know. They are the ones. They are not possessed. They are the devils. Here the Christians are possessed by devils. So, little bit excuse is there for them.
But for example, as I told you, in Westminster Cathedral, I lived facing. And in the afternoon the only activity is the beer barrels coming in and going out, you see. [laughing] I was surprised. This is the activity going on in the church, you see. Morning time all people going to the church and afternoon all that, the barrels, you see, coming in a truck and unloading and loading in the truck. I said, “How many barrels these people consume?” These are the priests. They just drink beer, I think, they don’t drink water.

Sahaja Yogi: Did you have some tea?
Shri Mataji: I had. I had some coffee. Thanks a lot. No, I don’t drink that. Thank you.
[Inaudible conversation]
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] the essence of the Bible.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: The essence of the Bible, Popes re-wrote the Bible.
Shri Mataji: A hundred percent.
Sahaja Yogi: Every Pope rewrote the Bible [Inaudible].
Shri Mataji: It’s too a great extent. I have never read it, you see. But I know. And whatever now for example the other day, they told Me that.. I said, “Why did they do this philanthropic work? These churches, missionary work.” So, somebody told Me that, “They did, Mother, because once there was a, before Christ was crucified, they brought some oil. He was to be rubbed with some very expensive oil. So, Judas gave a explanation, saying that, “Why do you want to waste this oil? Why not sell it and give it to the poor?” You see. So, Christ said that “Poor are all the time with you, but I am with you for a short time.” You see?
Now in that they start a philanthropic work. I said that, “If the divinity is important and not this, so I said, “Why did they follow this?” I mean, what He said was that divinity, the divine life is much more important than looking after these poor. But they have used it in the opposite direction. I don’t know. I have not read the whole of it. But must be some books they must have placed, you see.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, there was something very scareful and when I read it-
Another Sahaja Yogi: Apocalypse.
Shri Mataji: Ha.
Sahaja Yogi: And suddenly when I read something, I had such a terrible pain here in the center of the palm.
Shri Mataji: What was that?
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know, it was a description of the destruction of the universe. And the description was symbolized as a woman. That hurts me a lot. I don’t know why.
Shri Mataji: Destruction was a woman?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Let’s see what’s that. I would like to see that.
Sahaja Yogi: In the Bible, in the Apocalypse, I can show You the passage, I got the- She was called as the symbol of fornication and she was a symbol of a woman and a whore. And two pages before, they were describing the woman as a Goddess.
Another Sahaja Yogi: No but [inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, of course. But I saw it myself that the description the same two pages afterwards hurt me so much that I had a pain here. Because I don’t know if they mixed up the thing.
Shri Mataji: You see, they should have symbolized it as some sort of serpent or something would have been much better like it. But not as a woman or anything, you see. Because woman, that’s very cruel. But the destruction is going to come through Kalaki [Kalki].
Sahaja Yogi: How soon?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Sahaja Yogi: How soon?
Shri Mataji: No, not so soon, don’t ask for it! Because there won’t be any emancipation then, you see. It will be the last thing; we don’t want that just now. Let’s have more time to save all of you, all right? So, we don’t want Him just now.
Shri Mataji: Who else? Have you given him?

We have to do a lot of things before that. But is possibly, in the Bible also, there’s lots of things they have introduced. Yes, we have to find out. You see, because they wanted to put down women, might have been, might have put [unclear]. They have done all kinds of things. Here they have Mary, and then they want to put Her down. And then the Protestants, you see, they wouldn’t accept Mary as the saint. All sorts of things are there. And about Mary also very little is written down about her also. And it is in a- I think because of the changing of all this, the languages have become very mysterious also for people to understand leading to confusion.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Yes.

I think Julio give Me this, because everybody is having so I must have a little.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: You see, the Bible, the first Bible that was written, has been turned. Actually, this Bible is written five hundred years after Christ died. I don’t think that it’s the original one. It is through the Unconscious. It has been guided. All these scriptures are guided through Unconscious. The Unconscious manifests quite a lot. But still they try to do somehow.
Like Islam, Mohammed Sahib said that, “Now I am the last prophet. Now nobody is going to come and tell you.” You see? He just wanted to frighten people that they should take to dharma. So, He said like that. Now these Islam people are using it as a... But imagine anybody who says that, “I will never come to you,” and, “I will never do that,” like a father. You see, these horrible people again working it out in a different way. So, He has to come back.

I mean the incarnations are not obstinate people. He must have said it with the under-standing that these people will do this, because if I tell them they will accept religion properly. But He sees all of them drinking, all of them going down, doing all kinds of wrong things in the name of God. So He has to come back. How can you be obstinate? I only do like that many a times and say, "I will never go and meet you," Then I go. Be-cause that is love. So, what can you do? You forgive.

Shri Mataji: He said, “Oh, just see his vibrations. His. Ah, just let’s see. He has right heart.

You’re getting vibrations all right? You’re getting cool vibrations?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Very good. But really [inaudible] every day you’re changing very fast.
Sahaja Yogi:
Shri Mataji: Absolutely. I hope I’ll be able to recognize your friend from Yorkshire. You better tell Me. All right? Otherwise he may feel hurt. But the way people change I really cannot recognize, so.
Shri Mataji: [Name unclear] you’re back? They’ve gone?
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: That’s the one who had to go to Cambridge?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, that’s [inaudible] She left [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: So, she decided to go earlier. Her smoking has gone down, she said, suddenly. She smoked very few cigarettes.

Somebody asked Me the other day, “Why this time the power of Divinity is so much? So much that people are getting it” I said, “But the other forces are also so strong that you have to increase this Power, you see.” The other forces are so very strong. You will see smoking, then drinking and all this, you see, spoils your being. From everywhere you see how much. There are sixteen horrible devils have taken birth, sixteen and six women who are the top people. Horrible. They have taken birth. Can you imagine? How much force is needed? To kill one rakshasa was sufficient in one life. But here, just think of it. And they have entered into your own being. Then how much force is needed, inside out?

Shri Mataji: Did he use this mantra, Narakasura Mardini, or something?
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry?
Shri Mataji: Did they tell you any mantra for this one, for this Maheshyogi? Did Rustom give you any mantra for this Maheshyogi?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Sahaja Yogi: Hum.
Shri Mataji: Narakasura Mardini?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, and also, hum, Sarvamantra.
Shri Mataji: Sarvamantra Siddhi, Sarvamantra Siddhi and Narakasura Mardini. I think this Suraka Mantra Mardini works out also anywhere. That’s the reason you have got them steady still. I hope you get your friends down here.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Yeah. That would be nice. Then I’ll come to Yorkshire.
Yes, I will, I can. We have time to go out. Second of July, third of July, these things again. Apart from all other programs. Now Birmingham is fixed up, all these things from David.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: You asked David that Mataji has called you. You can come and see Me any one of these days. All right? David and- he said, “I’m free Mother.” the other fellow.
Sahaja Yogi: Philip.
Shri Mataji: Philip. I said, “But you get well first of all.” So, David and Philip both can come, as I said, to help [unsure] you.
I said Julio you can give Me a little tea, if everybody is having, I should also have, a little bit.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: If so [Hindi].
Sahaja Yogi: [Hindi].
Shri Mataji: I don’t want to trouble you.

Sahaja Yogi: Can I ask you Mother?
Shri Mataji: Hum. Yes, you should ask Me questions, absolutely you should.
Sahaja Yogi: I’m interested [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: What? You are interested in?
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Yes, in the same line.
Sahaja Yogi: And who is a prior Yogi.
Shri Mataji: I’m going to talk about it. That’s why.
Sahaja Yogi: What’s was Yogananda was saying?
Shri Mataji: “Neither he, nor his guru, nor their guru”.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: All of Babaji...
Sahaja Yogi: Babaji [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Oh, he’s horrible. Horrible, that Babaji was.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s supposed to [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Must be, when all these rakshasas [unclear] I don’t know. He’s the devil of devils, Babaji. They and this Yogananda’s guru was Lahiri. And Lahiri’s guru was this horrible fellow Babaji. Now this Lahiri’s grandson is in Bombay, and he came to see Me.
So, he told Me, “Because I was his grandson, Mother, I became a Kriya Yogi and did all that nonsense of taking out my tongue and this and that, and I did everything.”
Then he met another one, was this, who’s that? Krishnamurti. He was very much impressed by his personality and the way he talks and all that, you see. He plays those tricks. And he said that “This man is very good.” You see, he went to him. Then he became a Krishnamurti fan, you see. So, he came to Me afterwards. He said, “Now Mother You cannot cure me.”
I said, “Why?” He said, “On one side I’m a Kriya Yogi, done forever. Then I went to another horrible one who was Krishnamurti. I can give better speeches than Krishnamurti can on the things, subjects that he talks.”
And now he told about Lahiri Baba, his own grandfather. And he said, “What upsets me, was the kind of man he was. He was a very materialistic person, very harsh, extremely cruel. They had no love for his children neither for his grandchildren, a very funny type of a person. And then he started thinking, ‘Why is this fellow such a big Yogi when he has no love for anyone? And he’s done no good to anyone. Why is he?’ And so, I went this another one. And there I became an expert orator. I speak very well. I give big lectures about him. I talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and nothing happens to me. Now, can you save me, Mother?”
He came to Me. You’ll be surprised. Till today we have not been able to maintain his Kundalini awakening. It comes up and goes down because suction is too much in him. Poor fellow. Every time I go to India he comes down, quietly sits down. Still, we have not been able to fix it. So, Modi, one of my disciples, was so fed up with him. He said, “Now I’m going to get a nail to put it on his head so that will fix up the Kundalini there.” [Shri Mataji is laughing]
Poor fellow ne? [Hindi], He’s so unhappy! Very unhappy, but what to do? He said, “I can give better speeches than all these people put together. But what to do?”
He said, "I used to pretend I’m very subtle, I’m very sensitive, I understand this. I used to do all that. Now I realize that it is all pretensions".

Sahaja Yogi: So, how to stay for some time in Nirvikalpa? How they really [inaudible]?
Shri Mataji: Nirvikalpa.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: No not at all.
Sahaja Yogi: Because [inaudible] all the time
Shri Mataji: They say, "They are nirvikalpa".
In a way they are. Because vikalpa means doubt. They have no doubts about themselves that they are the greatest crooks, you see. So, they are in nirvikalpa [laughing]. So, that way you can say they are in nirvikalpa!

Now we have had great saints in our country, no doubt. Even a person, like Dnyaneshwara. What a great saint we had! And he was in the same line as Machhindernath, Gorakhnath, then Gyaninath and then his father. There was guruji nath. And he initiated him and we had a great guru, parampara [tradition], in our guru tradition, in that Nath Panthi. Even he, Dnyaneshwara, who was a Realized soul, no doubt, and his brother was really a very great saint. Even he, when he writes about the Kundalini awakening, he doesn’t do the way you, Sahaja Yogis, do. I wish you could read Marathi; I could make you understand. And how he has raised the Kundalini, what happens, he could give Realization to two people in his life time. You see.

So, you can imagine that these devils, they talk of divinity. For people like them also it was not so. So, what these people are talking about? I mean it is not even the particle of that ocean, not even the particle. But they are just talking about. You cannot achieve it at all, by any chance. They cannot go near it.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] Maharishi...
Shri Mataji: Yes, he can talk of these things, you see. But, if God is like that, you see, so He will bestow his powers in you. You have to be also omnipotent in a way if you are one with Him. And you have to be always present. And you have to be all doing.

But it is just the other way round. Instead you limited yourself, and you don’t know where you are going to land, and hanging in the air, you cannot control yourself. While in Sahaja Yoga you control everything. Sitting down here you can give vibrations to your mother, to your father, to anyone. You see, if you are all doing all, then you should be able to do it. But you cannot even control your own movements there. He just lifts you; you hang in the air, you fall down. Now, why do you need these things? I can’t understand that.
Sahaja Yogi: Respond damage.
Shri Mataji: You see, I mean, apart from that, it is so evitable to see that you do not need, it is so evident that you people do not need these things.
Because already you are raised from this earth by your planes, you have gone now to Moon. Now what more do you want? It is so clear cut. Because, you see, if you understand that this is tomfoolery, that’s the way you are going to solve it. It’s just playing tricks on you. That’s all it is.

If you are omnipresent, all right, that means you are present in everyone, all right? You are. You can feel the vibrations of everyone.
When I move my hand like this, see on your hands, you feel the cool breeze on your right hand or left hand. I will give the breeze on your hand [unsure] I’m moving hand, my own hand, I am giving this, you are feeling on your left hand. You see? Now, on your right hand.

[English transcription from1979-0527 Subconscious, Supraconscious UK NITL HD ] 

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: But this kind also, spiritually kind of things is there.
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know [inaudible] These people went to India, those Yugoslav, and teach Yoga because they have a guru there.
Shri Mataji: Oh. You know my husband is a citizen of Yugoslavia.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, really?
Shri Mataji: He got the citizenship of Potenza or something or some place, he got the citizenship. He has such a lot to do with Yugoslavia surprisingly. And they had ordered some ship from Yugoslavia, a huge big tanker [inaudible] oil.
And I suggested to my husband, “Why not be decorated in Indian style? Because Indian boys will be on the ship and after all, we have a lot of handmade things and we can decorate it better”.
And-be comfortable, sit a little bit so you can be comfortable also there, be comfortable-

And then we decorated. I decorated the ship sitting down in India only. And they have turned out very good. Two ships were there; one was called as Jawaharlal Nehru and another was Lal Bahadur Shastri , these two ships.

Sahaja Yogi: Your husband, Mother, and he went to Yugoslavia.
Shri Mataji: My husband. [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: But on the whole, people are more, sort of, in a state, you see, stable people, that’s why. Not too much of communism, not of much of this. But I still feel that as far as the morality part is concerned, they are a bit loose there.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s right. They drink too much
Shri Mataji: Drink too much
You can get divorce in Yugoslavia very easily.
Shri Mataji: That’s it, you see. Because one of the gentlemen whom I knew very well, every time he came, he came with a new wife. And it was difficult for us to remember.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: In India. Indians that way are foolish, they don’t understand these things. So, when he came for the second time with another wife, you see, they thought it was his sister, you see. And they said, “Is she your sister?” And so many things happened like that, quite embarrassing.

Like, one gentleman is sixty years old and he has a wife who’s about sixteen or eighteen, something like that. So, she comes to a party and everybody says, “Oh, very nice your daughter is, very nice your daughter is”. And nobody can even conceive of a thing that she could be the wife, you see. Because she’s coming [inaudible]. And in India the wife will never, sort of, cling to the husband and come here. She would be little away. This lady is clinging to the father because only the daughter would cling to the father in India you see.
[Laughter]
So, they would say, “It’s the daughter”. And if you tell them, then you should see their faces, “Ah? How can they?”
But they are getting sophisticated now, Indians are also. They are getting sophisticated.

But, you see, these young people can become quite funny. The other day, one- I told them that one gentleman came as a sadhu, dressed like a sadhu, and I was in Bombay. He came for three days, in a program, continuously, three days. And he came and I mean, he touched my feet, he sat down, he said, “Mother, I must get my Realization” and all that. “Till three days, you were OK, what’s wrong with you? You seem to be a nice man. What’s the matter? You see, outwardly you are so nice, why your Kundalini doesn’t rise? It’s frozen.” Like that and third day, it just froze up, you see, it came to a point and then it went down. And then somebody told Me, “He’s the guru of Mahesh yogi”.
Sahaja Yogi: His guru?
Shri Mataji: Guru of Mahesh yogi, he’s.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Yes, they said, “He is the one”.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: No. The one who is now his guru. There’s one who is now his guru.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: You see, because this was told to Me, whosoever it is, I’ve forgotten his name, but this one is real guru he has. This is the one who is his guru.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: And he stays there in the train. Because one gentleman, one mister Jaholi, who is with the railways, who has been with the TM also, and he came and tole Me that he became very closed to Maheshyogi. And this Maheshyogi he used to go and touch his feet every day and this fellow was living with him. He said this.

Who’s this guru is it? This Maheshyogi tells you lies.
Sahaja Yogi: Maheshyogi is a guru and [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: [inaudible] That’s why he was horrible, absolutely, the worst of all. The worst of all these, I would say, Shankarachani he was the worst.
All the devils have become Shankarachani [inaudible] all of them are devils except for one who was a Realized soul and then they threw him out, Kanshi fellow. They threw him out.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Who’s swami?
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Pune. In Pune there is no but maybe. Maybe, you see they are-
Sahaja Yogi: But he gave up. The story is that he gave up.
[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Oh, that fellow!
Sahaja Yogi: That’s right.
Shri Mataji: Oh! But that too he is no good. He is not a Realized soul, I know, I know. He is not a Realized soul at all! He’s also not a Realized soul. So, what does he get? Only the Shankaracharya said that, “They are not Realized souls, they’ll get their Realization”.

And then, this Swamirama has done also a lot of – [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Oh! And how, when did he die?
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That was the only way he could die, you see?
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: He was horrid. I’ll tell you what they do. You see, they do not go to jungle or forest to seek God. They’ll go there to seek power. You see, they confuse Power, Shakti, with all the funny things. Now, the other day, were you for my lecture in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan hall? Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, you were there?
Sahaja Yogi: No.
Shri Mataji: No. So, there I told as, we have got around us also other things like supraconscious and we’ve got the left-hand side, subconscious and all that. And also, the Hell below, you see. It is easy to go to the three places, very easy. So, what they try to do is to go to supraconscious also this side. And there, achieve these things. And that is what they really want. They do not want the Superconsciousness; that, they do not ask for. And they go for that and they will do all kinds of things just to get it, you see. So, they go to treachery, this, that.
This is not what I was going to talk to you about. Now do you think our Sahaja Yogis are efficient enough for [inaudible]? Or we should, I mean, later on talk about this point which I wanted to tell you: how the Kundalini rises or what are the subtle things that happen. And Raja Yoga and what are the differences between the two.
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: You should stay over, good idea. Yes, it’s a good idea. You should stay over, it’s a good idea, yes, a good idea. You see, this fellow is, ‘Brahmanand and the Saraswati’ [false guru’s names] anyone of these, are nothing but supraconscious, you see, masters, they are supraconscious. Masters in the sense they catch hold of people who were very ambitious, you see, they are dead bodies. Say, an Indian tomorrow dies, say for example. Take it official like that. They will, all of them will hover around him. They’ll try to capture his soul, you see. There’s a method by which they do it, is to have a [inaudible] they will have a siddhi about it. We should not call it a siddhi, because siddhi has something to do with Superconsciousness. But what I mean, the control over the spirit and the way they do it. That, you see, how they practice this art of dead is very simple. And to begin with, what they have to do is to fix their attention at a point.
Say, if you fix your attention in the dark: now you don’t try all these tricks, I’m just telling you what they do they do. But it’s not meant for trying anything of this for you, because you are not interested in this nonsense and this is only for people who want to, sort of, exploit the supraconscious methods. So, they fix their attention say to a dark, in a dark room to a point which is light. They will put a black thing, all right, make a hole in that and sit down in a dark room and put a light there. And then watch through that little hole, very small aperture you can call it.

So, you get a very little light coming through that and they go into that: so, your attention starts piercing through your Agnya. The Agnya is pierced out, you see, so you are entering into the supraconscious area. Or else, also you can enter into the subconscious, depending on what is your desire and things like that. So, you can enter into that. Once you start entering into the supraconscious or into the subconscious, especially the subconscious area, is easy to do with that, then what they do is to put your attention onto dead.

Like, you see you go, a person dies, they’ll sit down there and they’ll think of the person they expect. Now, if you can understand this way that if you are in England, you can see England.
If you are in India, you can see India. In the same way, if you know how to go to India, you can also see India. It is just like a television set. You see, if you can put your Agnya to your dead, you can go into the dead area. So, they start seeing the dead, they see the apparitions, they see people, devils coming down, they see all these things. They can see. And then, these gurus tell them how to man it and also how to overpower these spirits that you see. So, then they go into another kind- I mean this kind, for any kind of, they call it, as the “prataka”, they call it as “prataka”, that you do the “prataka”.
Now this concentration of a Agnya, if you start doing it, you see, then you develop a- they call it a siddhi, but I would not call it a siddhi, because the spirit may just overpower them also, possibly. If not, they might overpower the spirit. So, with the help of the spirit, they start doing some tricks. This is only one style I will tell you, but there are so many ways of doing this, of this concentration business.

So, your attention goes into the supraconscious or into the subconscious, there. Once your attention goes there, then these people who are there, you see, they start taking interest in you because most of them are busy bodies. You see, they cannot retire from old life. So, they are around these, so they come down to your help.
15:58
Now the supraconscious people, which, of course this fellow is angry, ‘Brahmanand and the Saraswati’ [false guru’s names] and all this sort you see, what they do, they- these are the busy bodies like the doctors who are dead, like the scientists who are dead, who have had nothing to do with searching of God, nothing to do of getting bliss in life but always have been running up and down. Especially in these times, since, say about a hundred years back, since this industrial revolution has started, people have lived on the speed, you see, very speedy people have come out, they have been ego-oriented people. So, we have much more dead people of this kind in the last hundred years, you see. So, this kind of people were not so much harnessed [unsure] before as they are nowadays. Because they are much more in the atmosphere, especially in the Western side, they are much more in the atmosphere, even in India. You see, any scientist, who is dead, is not satisfied because he thinks he has not achieved anything, his name or something, he must at least appear in one new book. So, if he has not done that, then they are very unhappy, you see, so, they don’t want to die.

When they don’t want to die, you see, they hover around, then they try to come just- they are, you see, helpers. So, if you are a doctor, they’ll just come handy for you to help you like that. Or, maybe, otherwise, you can do that.

Now, like that doctor Lang’s example, I always give it, it’s very interesting. He is in England, he would die in England, this fellow. You must find this fellow if he is finished or his organization still exists or not. Its name was International Organization of curate-
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: “Hardy land”.
Another Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: No, one day you catch on the left so much, you beat him with shoes horrible fellow. O, this is his son!
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: I’ll tell you about him, if he’s the same now you’ll locate him. Maybe the same or somebody’s name now. This one was some “Land International” I don’t know whatever he was. This fellow died long time back and this one was a doctor. And then, you see, he was not satisfied of himself. So, he was hanging around or whatever it was, you see. And he just thought that he should come into somebody. So, there was one soldier, English soldier fighting in Vietnam for the things, you see- an American soldier, I am sorry, American soldier. And he came into his being and he told him, “I’m such and such doctor Lang in London. So, you’d better go and see my son. And this son will be able to help you a lot and I will work through you and you should not be frightened”. So, first this fellow opposed him. But he said, “No, you have to be, because you are a healthy man, nothing can happen to you. My son is not that healthy, so you come along.” And he brought him down here. When he came here to England, he went and saw the son. And the son could not believe it. So, he told him all the secrets that pass between the father and the son, you see. So, that’s how the father had faith in him and- the son had faith and they started this organization “International Curative Center of Doctor Lang”. Late doctor Lang, imagine!
So, the late doctor Lang worked through this soldier, and this doctor was absolutely surprised but they made a lot of money.
[Laughter]

And what they did was to inform the people. Like, supposing one mister X was in India or, that’s how I came to know about them. Because they came to Me for treatment later on. So, mister X would write to them that, “I’m so sick this and this disease and do something about it”. So, they would send the message that, “All right, at this time, at this state, at this moment, we’ll come and help you”. But I must say, being an English man, they were not as crooked as Indians are. And they were very honest about it and they said they were using spirits, you see. So, they didn’t say- they said late doctor Lang. You know, they didn’t tell lies even when they were dead. [Shri Mataji is laughing] That they were doing themselves. So, I mean he just said that, it was like that. And there was a lady who came to see Me, and she told Me that she had some sort of a rheumatism or what, something she had. And then they wrote to this doctor Lang’s this thing. And then one day, you see, then they wrote that, “You stay in bed and all that, and be on the watch”. And then she started shivering and this thing, you see. And people went in the queue for that, you see, to get three months or four months ahead of things, you see. I mean they must be asking for some spirit to come down to help them. So- or maybe some doctors or some people might be coming just to help them, these spirits. I mean the dead spirits of these ambitious people. And they would put these doctors into their body and they would enter into the body and cure them, I don’t know how they managed it. And she felt all right for a few months. Then she came to Me.
Of course, when she came to Me, she was like, “Oh what’s going on”. So, I said, “What’s the matter? You are possessed”. She said, “How can I be possessed? I belong to doctor Lang.” I said, “Who is this doctor Lang?” She said, “He is no more and he is dead”. And she was talking like that. And I asked her all the things then she told Me what has happened. I said, “Now what is your complaint, now?” She said, “Now I am all the time shaking. If I see God’s photograph, I mean name even taken or anything, I just shake. All the time I’m shaking. So, I don’t know what to do. They told me, ‘You are Parkinson disease or something is there’”. I said, “Nothing of the kind, you are pure and simply possessed”. And then we tried this lime, lemon treatment and all that. After that, she was cured completely but it took a lot of time for this doctor Lang to get out of her”.
So, this is how I came to know how they are practicing these things all the way from England, you see, this fellow was practicing this. Maybe this is doctor Lang, this another “Hardy Land” maybe a different person. But this, I’m telling you, there was a centre here, but I don’t know the address of the gentleman. And this is what they did.

So, you see, like they sent, these people, I think, must have concentrated on the Western people. They must have thought that, “Let us get some spirit from the West”. Because only the Western spirits can influence the West, you see, because they required people of their own type. So, they must have contacted some of these horrible spirits and they must have contacts with them.
But the first encounter with this Maheshyogi was in England. Actually, I should say, in a real way. Since I came to know that he was very horrid and all that, I mean we discovered in no time in 1970 only, I told about him. But the real, I mean, the discovering to his ways and all that came to Me because one teacher of Maheshyogi came to see Me. His name was Yuji, he’s from America. He came to see Me and he went to India to see Me first. And then he came to England to see Me. And his parents also came to see Me.

Now, the problem of the victims is they commit suicide and he tried to commit suicide. He tried but he did not. He escaped every time. So, the parents got worried and they brought him to India because somebody told them about Me. Or somebody who might cure all his suicide tendencies, that person told him so he came. Then there, he found out that I was not there so he came to London to see Me.

So, when he came here that time, perhaps I had not even started my work. So early he came down. I had just left India and he didn’t know I was here. So, he came to see Me and he came to my house in Acton. I must tell you this experience was wonderful. So, I asked him, “What do you do?” He said, “I’m a teacher with Maheshyogi”. And I said, “Then why do you commit suicide?”
He said, “Because I don’t know, you know, what happened in the beginning when I was teaching, I felt like killing my parents. So, I tried to throttle my father, throttle my mother”. ‘What’s the matter with you?’ They said. And then I met somebody, a relation of mine and he said that, ‘This is something you can’t understand. If it has anything to do with God, why kill your parents? I mean it’s something funny’.”
He said, “I don’t know, somebody comes and tells me, ‘You’d better kill your parents or something’. Because they are different type, I mean, they give every time new ideas to me”.
So, I said, “All right. Then now, what happened later”. He said, “Later on, I started thinking that it is something wrong. It is better I kill myself. So, I started to kill myself and I did it thrice, I failed and my parents got upset with me. So, somebody told that, ‘This cannot be cured anywhere else, you’d better take to Puna”. He got a trip down there.

So, I told him, “All right”. Now I put a bandhan on him, first of all. And then I said, “All right, what is the mantra he gave you?” He said, “He gave me a mantra, ‘shringa’”. And also ‘Shringa’ was a very big sage in India before Rama’s birth [inaudible] Then we speak because he was a Realized soul and I said, “How can this name can be given to him?” So, I was rather surprised.
So, I gave him a double bandhan, you see, and I myself went into that supraconscious state to find out about the fellow. And he was a horrid looking rakshasa. One of the worse I had never seen is, with one pawn [unsure] he had and two teeth coming out, you see, horrible stuff. So, I said, “What’s the matter? How are you here mister Shringa?” [Laughter]
I said, “How is your name mister Shringa?” You see, it has been on the tape, you see, I taped him. I taped him.
Sahaja Yogi: Shringa?
Shri Mataji: Shringa, mister Shringa, I taped him, you see? The boy was talking to Me, actually, but the Shringa was giving him ideas, you see? I said, “You’d better tell Me. Otherwise you know Me, who I am. I am going to put you right. So, you’d better tell Me all about yourself”.

So, he started telling through that boy. He said, “I’m such and such and I’m a rakshasa and this “. So, I said, “Why are you after this boy?” He said, “No, you see this, we are very few in number with Maheshyogi”. And he also told Me who is Maheshyogi and all that, the kind of a rakshasa he was. He said, “Mother, he is frightened of you and we all know you very well”. And he also said that, “First, we wanted some more devils to come in. So, we wanted to kill the parents. But then he could not kill the parents. So, now we wanted to have his life because we need more spirits than more living people. So, we wanted to use them because really, we need a big army of people”. But I said, “Why? Why you all?” He said he’s meant upon killing because he wants to have more spirits and an army to fight God”. I said, “Really? He thinks he can fight God?” He said, “Now, with big Jivas there, he knows he can fight you better now”. So, I said, “How is he going to fight Me? It’s not easy, I have killed him before. Now, how is he going to fight Me?” He tells Me that he is going to use them as first stages [unsure] to the Yogi. And that’s how I first came to London. Why is he interested in Yogi? This is the fact.
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Just let me finish, he? A little while. So, I gave, you see, I asked him, you see, that when he came to this centre, he felt very much better. I tight up this fellow, this Shringa, and put him up on one of the Action streets, you see, still hanging now.
[Laughter]

He’s still there, tied up, you see. I said, “You’d better be there”. And since then he [Maheshyogi] is not giving this name much to people, but he tries. He doesn’t know where this Shringa has gone.
All right. But I would say that then, I made him listen to this tape because he [the American boy] would not believe. I gave him the tape. I said, “Take it with you”.

And, you’ll be amazed, he wrote to Me, saying, from there, that, “Mother, I lost the tape on my way, I don’t know where”. How this tape was lost? Very sad. [Unsure]

Because he had to change his plan at New York and went to the hotel and from there, he lost it. Terrible thing [inaudible].
Now, tell Me [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: It’s very easy my child, you see, it’s very easy. Among these supraconscious spirits, there are some who have been doing also the seeking of the Absolute. They are overread pandits. They are people who know all Sanskrit, everything, and through them you can talk all this nonsense, you see? Talking about Absolute is very easy, but raising the Kundalini is the main point. And the Absolute that they have told you is not the Absolute which you’ll find out slowly. Then I will tell you what it is.
But these are the people who read. I’ll tell you, supposing I read about England and tell somebody, “O, this is England and all that”. That’s not real. I should be there. They have not been here. So, when you come back, you see, like my daughters when they came here, you see, they had read lots of things about England. It’s long time back, now England is much better. In 65, they came down. And they were very anxious to come and see England, you see.

When we came it was horrible! All the buildings were black, you know, with smoke. [Shri Mataji is laughing] “It’s all green!” They were so much stupefied and they said, “What is this land? We are going back home. No, no, no, no, no more here, we don’t want it”. And every day used to be a very cold day and all, you see, months used to chatter with cold and they couldn’t go out and anyway they were so tired [Shri Mataji is laughing] of the place. They said, “No, no, no, no, we don’t want to be here”.
So, you see, it’s a different thing to be here and to talk about it. Because, you see, people have written about it, so they talk about it. It’s easy to talk. Supposing somebody reads my, about my book, it’s about what I say. They talk what? [Unsure]. Many who have done like that also-
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: That’s the spirits, you see? Not many here, but there’s a spirit. You see, now, say, I’ll tell you. First experience would be, for example, I am my own. All right? Then I’m worried about my household, about my business, about my things. But “somebody” comes in [inside you] and takes the charge. So, you get the experience of relaxation, “O God, somebody is looking after me”. But when the camel enters in, you see, it spreads [unsure] and will not let you in [unsure] and starts occupying everything and you are out. Then these experiences start getting- you see, these are all experiences of a spirit who is a supraconscious; spirit who is not a supraconscious is different thing. This is also another very subtle thing.

If you are possessed by a subconscious spirit, very gradually you start understanding that they are very sly, and they make you very slothful, you sleep a lot with that. You see, all these things happen with the subconscious ones, you see? And with the supraconscious ones, you become speedy. You become much more speedy than you are, you become dynamic. Because “somebody” is a planner who is dead, he is left with some plans. He comes in your head and gives his plans to you. You may even become successful, may even become successful. But your mind goes out. Gradually when, you see, those people have exhausted themselves, they disappear. And moreover, you see, when you start working out their plans, though it may appear that you are working out better and efficient, in the result, you find that everything is lost. Because it is not with the Divine, the plan is not in tune with the Divine, you see. So, you find every thing is lost like that. So, the- you see, these are the subtleties of the supraconscious spirits. They are very ambitious people, very cunning, very efficient, you see, so-called. I wouldn’t tell them efficient in the real sense, but so-called efficient. Because those who do not know the plan of God are inefficient, you see.
