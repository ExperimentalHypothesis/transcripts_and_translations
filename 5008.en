Advice to the yogis (especially the westerns), Sangli (India), 21 December 1988.

I’ve heard that you have been all very sick. I think I got sick because of that, I Myself.  Now I hope you are all better. Still there are sick people? How many? 


Sahaja Yogi: About, about [seventeen/seventy].


Shri Mataji: [Seventeen/Seventy] are sick, in bed? Where are they? 


Now there’s something I must tell you, that the other day these girls were making Me wear ornaments and I felt very funny smell from them. So I think that you people do not wash your hands properly. After going to the, going to the toilet I told you to use water all the time. It’s very important. But you people stick still to the Western style that’s very dirty, I tell you. It’s a very dirty style of living, is not to use the water. It’s very unhygienic also. That’s why you find in the West most of the people are sick. Not here, you have seen yesterday how the boys were dancing, so quick and fast. So that’s one thing one has to remember is to wash your hands after coming out of the toilet, before food. Yesterday I smelled their hands and I was amazed, smelling awfully bad. So that’s not an Indian custom or anything but it’s a hygienic system. 


So I hope you have got lotas. Have you got lotas there? You had it. But still you keep to that dirty thing with which you have got AIDS, you got all your problems, because of that dirty habits. So please try to understand. Now in England or anywhere I’ve seen you use spoons, forks and other things, you see, so don’t use directly your hands. When you don’t use your hands directly it’s all right but also I think it’s a dirty habit in any case. But if you are using forks or spoons or something it’s at least you are not touching your food with that dirty hands. 


Only that time I realized that these people have again taken to the bad habits. This paper business is the dirtiest. People, you are so much used to that smell that you do not feel it. But I have seen it, even when you have receptions and things, I am sitting there and meeting people or even if I am shaking hands with them, I feel terrible. The smell is too much in the hands. The sensitivity is lost. You cannot feel the smell. Can you smell your hands now? Let’s see. Do you feel that? Is no need to put any scents or anything but with the soap nicely. Here in India we use our clay because clay in India is very good. You can use the clay. Just use the clay nicely and clean your hands. It’s very important. And that’s why I have seen that in the West everybody is sick. All the time there’s something wrong, something. You’ll never find them healthy. I think this is one of the reasons.


Something is always wrong with them. If you go, I mean Indians were there, they all had the same food as you ate, nothing happened to them. And we had made special arrangements for water also. But this is something you are very negligent about. You have to be very careful. I don’t know how you manage. We, we can’t live without it. Even if supposing we go to some place and there’s nothing available, just we have to use the paper, sometimes, even in England sometimes, in, we come back home immediately and have a bath. So personal cleanliness is very important, anywhere. Here you cannot blame anything to anything because I have seen people who ate the same food, live there; they are quite healthy and hearty. Nothing has gone wrong with them. And we don’t also eat too much of raw food. That’s also another thing good is that there’s no question or thing falling into it. Moreover, even if somebody told Me that the utensils were washed in the plate, doesn’t matter, but the food was cooked. You see, once you put it on the fire it’s all cleansed out. It cleanses out. It cannot give you [the/this] sickness. 


Then secondly, I’ve seen you are very negligent about also covering up yourselves. You must take a shawl all the time, even if you feel little warm ? doesn’t matter ? but you can take it out. But keep it handy all the time. That’s also you get sick because there is dust everywhere and if you have a shawl around at least you are protected. So you should always wear those [bundies] we have given you. That has come free with the cloth, with the dresses that you have got. And the ladies must keep their shawls with them. We have to respect our body because these bodies are not ordinary bodies. They are temples of God. 


Thirdly, I’ve been requesting you to put some oil in your heads at least once a week but now the fashion is not to put any oil. So you don’t want to put any oil on your heads. At least once a week you must put some oil in your heads. That would keep your head cool, and also before taking bath use some oil for rubbing on your hands or on your body. We always do that. You people don’t have any oil with you? Do you have any oil? Sure? Then please rub it on your body before taking your baths. You must rub oil on your body nicely before taking your baths. Also I’ve seen people in the West don’t do it. Just they never use oil. Before taking baths at least for fifteen minutes just rub oil on your bodies. They are very simple things but you just don’t do it. I just don’t know. These few things if you look after I think you’ll be all right. And if you are sitting outside cover your heads. It has been rather cold this time. Winter has been little cooler than before. Reason is it has rained a lot. But I mean, compared to your country, it is not cold. But negligence can cause it. So please keep yourself covered and then have your baths. If you take bath with cold water you can never catch cold because the temperature is the same. For a while you will feel it’s cold water but it’s very good. Those people who take a bath with cold water… Did you get hot water to have baths? 


Sahaja Yogi: Yes.


Shri Mataji: Where?


Sahaja Yogi: In Brahmapuri.


Shri Mataji: You had hot water? That’s very wrong. That’s the reason; that explains. If you have to take bath with hot water then you must get into your bed. If you have to take it in the open [sure/short] you’ll get temperature, absolutely [sure/short]. This is a very simple thing which I don’t know how you don’t know. You should never take your bath in the open with the hot water. That’s [sure/short]. I mean, anybody who wants to, you see, in the school supposing some boys doesn’t want to go, so what he does, he keeps the window open and takes his bath with hot water. Finished. He gets a temperature immediately, next day. So in Brahmapuri if they have given you hot water you should not have taken bath. That was wrong. Even if you had got, I mean River Ganges, I mean I don’t know if you, how many have been to River Ganges? You have been. Now, the water is freezing cold, I tell you, is absolutely freezing cold. When you put your foot you’ll just push it back, it’s so cold. 


But people get into it slowly, slowly. They just move, slip into it. I mean, you come out; your cheeks are red like apples. It’s so very cold, isn’t it? But nothing happens, nobody catches cold or anything. So in the running water is the cleanest and where you could get in, get into cold water. Otherwise, even if you have to take a hot water bath, take it in the night, or maybe at the time when you can go off into your bed. In, in England also, people take their baths in the night mostly and get into bed. Supposing you take hot bath in England and go out, immediately you’ll get cancer of the lungs. Hot and cold is a very important thing one has to know. Like also you can see on the hands you feel hot and cold. So now supposing you have taken the coffee. After that you cannot take anything cold. It’s a simple thing one should understand. First you can take anything cold. 


Like I’ve seen people take coffee and then ice cream. I’m sure you get troubles, absolutely sure. But if you are taking ice cream, first take ice cream, then take a biscuit and then take some water then take some biscuit and then you can take something hot. Now supposing you have taken something hot and you have to take water also then take three biscuits. Another very great precaution you have to take which I’d seen nobody takes, now it’s sometimes becomes very hot outside, you are sitting down into programs or something, becomes very hot, you are sitting in the sun sometimes, and your head gets very heated up. Immediately you go and get cold water. Definitely you will get sick, no doubt about. That’s the best way to get sick. So if you are sitting in the sun, immediately you should never, never, never, take any water till you have eaten something sweet. 


Take some sugar, or take some jaggery or some biscuit or something. Even if you are very thirsty you should not do it. Little precautions have to be taken. Nothing should happen to Sahaja Yogis because if you get sick I get sick. That’s the problem is. And that’s how I was so sick yesterday. I knew that you must be all very sick. That’s why it has happen to Me. I mean, I must work much harder than you people do. Unending meetings are there. I have to meet other people apart from you, giving realization to them, discuss all other organizational problems, this, that. Nothing happens to Me. But these precautions must be taken. [Hindi] 


Look at these Indians ? they are travelling with you; they are all right. Nobody’s sick. Why? None of them are sick. You see, from our childhood is taught to us, we must wash our hands at least ten times a day. And then too much tea, you people take too much tea. That’s very injurious for the intestines, very injurious. It has tannin, you know that. So much tea you people take ?it’s very wrong ? plus milk with it. Milk, it gives you diarrhea. Limit your tea-taking or even if you have to take many cups of tea then see that it’s a very light tea, extremely light, very light tea. But this Marathi tea, only one cup in the morning is sufficient. Too much tea is very dangerous. I mean, it’s easily available here. They don’t mind even if you have a full drum of a tea each person, but it is not good for you. Too much tea is not good at all. So limit your tea-taking. 


Also all the time to take tea is not a very good idea. It’s some sort of a thing that has happen. I think is the attention part; attention. Now ask Indians how many times they take tea, though we grow so much tea here. [Hindi] At the most, two times. If they have taken early in the morning tea, they will not have any tea for breakfast and once in the evening, finished. If there’s a music program in the night they might take one cup. Because they know, because of this tea your stomach goes out of order. You cannot sleep. It’s a very wrong thing. But I have seen when I was building My house, or I should say when I was doing renovation of My house, that at the slightest pretext they used to enter into the kitchen, make tea, drink it. Fifteen cups, twenty cups. I used to wonder, “What’s the matter with these people?” Of course, it’s cheap to give tea. It’s all right, doesn’t cost much money but it’s very dangerous. So reduce your intake of tea, and water should be increased; more water, less of tea. 


Tea itself, it’s not a very good thing. If you see how much your Mother takes tea, you see, I may take even ten cups of tea but the, so much of tea will be there, even ten cups, just the water, you see, just to please people I’m taking tea. And no sugar, no milk. That you know very well; everybody knows. No sugar, no milk, finished. Milk itself gives diarrhea. Just like that, I don’t mind sugar otherwise, for liver patients, but not too much of it also. Those who are liver patients can take sugar. Otherwise, normally you should not take too much sugar also. All these little, little things if you look after it will be all right. Tonight I have arranged for them…[Hindi] I hope so they are arranging some ajwain dhuni. They all should have it. It’s a very good thing, ajwain. Also those who are having diarrhea can have it. It’s all right. Just clears you out completely. And diarrhea should not make you weak. I mean, I normally in a one month’s time I have at least twenty days diarrhea, really. The reason is I take everybody’s problems upon Myself and it goes out as diarrhea, but it doesn’t make Me weak. So just the attention is the idea. Diarrhea is important sometimes to cleanse you out. It is important. To Me it’s a relief. Ah, if it is thirty five motions or forty motions then it’s all right but three four motions it is very good sometimes. 


Also Indian food is a heavy food. It’s not so light as we have English food or Western food is very light, easy to digest. Indian food is not. So that’s why I asked you to dance, to have some exercise. This way we can digest it, while we are all having sedentary habits mostly. We are sitting down doing nothing. See, Indians are working. We are not working at all. So we should do little walking or some exercises. It’s a heavy, no doubt, but you cannot make it very light. Though I tell them, “Make it very light, no chillies, nothing”, they are trying. For example, today’s lunch was really too much for Me. 


It’s all right once in a while, you eat it, and evening time I told them to give a very simple food. So that’s how it can be compensated, that evening time simple food, day time heavy,  or evening time it is heavy then day time simple food. But Indians are like that. They want, they are fond of, you see, they, they have this fondness to feed you, very anxious to feed you. But don’t fall a trap to that. You should just say, “No, no, no, no.” But they’ll go on saying, “Please have.” They feel very happy. They themselves if you see, they don’t eat so much. They are very clever. You see them how much they eat. 


They’ll get up at five o’clock, have their bath. They are ready for everything. And the whole day if you see they eat very little themselves. And you know how much I eat Myself. But if it comes to telling people to eat, I’ll say, “Please have more. Please have more.” But you should not listen [them/there]. As much as you can tolerate, take it because you may not be able to digest. I will say because I don’t want you to feel embarrassed how to take more. So I’ll say, “Go on. Eat more.” But you should not listen. 


I think most of our problems are solved now as far as marriages are concerned, and perhaps maybe one marriage we have to neutralize a little bit and there’s somebody coming also from Simla. I think according to the Western standards he’s a handsome man. You can use him for a model according to the Western style. But according to Indian style he is not. He’s quite a person who looks like all the models I see in Harrods. It’s very surprising, and according to Yogi he thought he may not be appreciated because of his looks. I said, “What? See, they all have like this only faces. I saw them in Harrods, so many of them put out as models.” So there’s somebody coming down and Yogi is bringing him tomorrow. So there’s one more person is coming and I hope not last minute people. Don’t, don’t stand up just to say that, “I want to get married”. [Marathi] Where is Mr. Khan? [Hindi] Is he not here? [Hindi] Oh, I see. He must have gone somewhere. All right. [Hindi] I’ve made some medicine for you, for this diarrhea business. But I think one should not pay so much attention to that, to diarrhea. It’s better cleanse it out; it’s cleansing. But do you feel very weak with diarrhea, do you? 


Sahaja Yogi: There are two cases, Shri Mataji.


Shri Mataji: Ah? 


Sahaja Yogi: There are two cases with high fever or something that cannot be discussed [right now/like that].


Shri Mataji: High fever? Now he’s all right. Temperature has come down?


Sahaja Yogi: Still [unclear].


Shri Mataji: Then put them right to the left. If it is high temperature put them right to the left. If it is diarrhea then no problems but, diarrhea it’s all right because it’s parasympathetic activity. It’s cleansing, you see. I always have diarrhea. I mean, it’s, I’m telling you out of thirty days, at least twenty days minimum I have diarrhea. But I’m quite all right because it’s just cleansing out. But if you go on thinking, “I have diarrhea. I’ve got headache. I have this,” then even if you are not sick you’ll feel more sick. One should not pay so much attention. What was the temperature? 


Sahaja Yogi: About thirty nine four.


Shri Mataji: How much?


Sahaja Yogi: Thirty nine four. 


Shri Mataji: Well, tell Me in [Celsius/cent]. This way I don’t understand. Hundred and how much?


Sahaja Yogi: Around hundred, hundred and eight.



Shri Mataji: Hundred? Hundred is no temperature. It’s nothing. Was that hundred and four? Oh, then it’s no temperature. It’s all right. High fever means hundred and four. 


Sahaja Yogi: [unclear]


Shri Mataji: Yes, it is. But they must have taken, if you take bath with hot water, you can try, in the open, immediately you’ll get hundred temperature, immediately. It’s absolutely inevitable. But I don’t know how you don’t know these things. You don’t know, ah, doctor? 


Sahaja Yogi: [We have started to be worried now] with today, with the food they gave us. The yoghurt, dhahi, dhahi was very helpful about one [unclear] after that. 


Shri Mataji: With the yoghurt what happened?


Sahaja Yogi: They tried [today]. They got better. Then we started because the [unclear] are many within the spices of two days we started to make proper treatments, organized people [who have the diarrhea], get black coffee. 


Shri Mataji: Ha… But diarrhea is not to be feared so much, doctor, and you see hundred temperature is no temperature at all…


Sahaja Yogi: [No, but the several had hundred, might hundred and two were having]


Shri Mataji: But it’s all right once in a while. I always, I so many times, see, if I feel My temperature I’ll go mad [like that]. It’s nothing, you see, temperature is there because of the heat, something, and hundred two is nothing, is like is not something to be reported. I personally think that way, you see. [Hindi] We Indians, for us hundred and two is not temperature. You people are very delicate, I must say. A very delicate health you have. You saw the boys how they were dancing. You saw the way they were doing things. You see, it’s, life is so active, the bodies. The lethargic nature, you see, it makes you so delicate. You saw yesterday how they were doing all that. That’s very common; I also used to learn all that. 


We all have to learn. So you keep your body moving and this thing. I mean for, you would go to a college even if you have hundred and two temperature, like that. It’s not much. But you are very delicate and bearing power is less; I think so. Hundred and four, of course we start worrying but hundred and two is not much. I thought you are so sick, that is hundred and six. [Hearing/Really] I got worried. But for that you just put left to the right. You’ll be all right. This is because of not using proper precautions. Now don’t take hot bath in the open. Just this much you try. There’s no harm in getting into cold water. Cold is always good. Always get into cold water. Take your bath in the cold water. You’ll never get, you’ll never catch cold. 


See when I was in India, I always used absolutely cold water. But when I went to England everybody told Me, “You can’t do that.” Just forced Me to take hot water and I started getting cold. Otherwise, I never get cold. So hot water should be used. All right, use the hot water then get into your beds. That’s the best way to get into temperature, I tell you. Just avoid hot water bath but if you take hot water bath see to it that you take the hot water bath and after that you get into your beds, no exposure, all right? [Hindi] 


We, we made a medicine, which doesn’t look very interesting but it won’t taste bad. [Hindi] For diarrhea only, not for everyone, only those who have diarrhea. Also if you can remember one thing more is to when you come out of these processions you just gargle with little warm water or even ordinary water. Gargle out, so the dust will come out. There may be the dust. You are not used to the dust. That’s also another reason you get this coughing. Are they here, those who have temperature? 


Sahaja Yogi: [They are not here]. They are in bed.


Shri Mataji: Not here?


Sahaja Yogi: [unclear] not there, they are in the [back of pendal].


Shri Mataji: Can you see if they have temperature now? I was worried. The way it was told to Me, I thought some sort of an epidemic has come or what. Really, like plague, you know, the description was so horrible. Some of you have had some gurus, you see, and that’s why also the Void acts very fast. They must be the first time they must be visiting, most of them. And they must have this guru trouble and the Void must be showing off. What has happened to Patrice from Shudy Camp? Where is he? What’s gone wrong with you, Patrice?


Patrice: Yesterday [unclear].


Shri Mataji: What is he saying? [Hindi] Oh, yes…


Patrice: Yesterday I couldn’t move [my hands]. 


Shri Mataji: You couldn’t what?


Patrice: I couldn’t move.


Shri Mataji: Move?


Patrice: Yes, I had pain in my bones and I had fever and diarrhea. I tried to stand [nearly] the whole Puja; at the end I almost collapsed. My chakras were blocked and moving [unclear] to be finished over.


Shri Mataji: What happened? 


Patrice: I don’t know, Shri Mataji. I swallowed some water and... 


Shri Mataji: Ah?


Patrice: I swallowed some water from the Krishna River.


Shri Mataji: Swallowed what?


Patrice: Swallowed some water from the Krishna River in that place, in Brahmapuri.


Shri Mataji: Drank some water?


Patrice: Well, I didn’t mean drinking but just had swimming but I don’t know if that’s the reason for. 


Shri Mataji: No, no, River Krishna is flowing. That’s no problem.


Patrice: Then, I don’t know. 


Shri Mataji: But they were saying that you were talking something or something. You were saying things. Funny things you were saying.


Patrice: Funny things?


Shri Mataji: Ah. Do you remember that? Did you say that? Somebody told Me that way. Was he like that? Anyone saw him? Doctor Spiro? 


Doctor Spiro: I didn’t hear him.


Shri Mataji: Ah?


Doctor Spiro: I didn’t hear him being very strange [unclear].


Shri Mataji: They said he was hilarious. So I thought must be his temperature must be very high. I don’t know what happened. 


Doctor Spiro: I maybe didn’t see him [inaudible].


Shri Mataji: Did anyone did see him talking too much or something?


Sahaja Yogi: Not really, Shri Mataji. He, he looked, he looked, he looked quite distressed. Now he looks quite all right. 


Shri Mataji: But what was the thing? What did he do? 


Sahaja Yogi: I don’t think he was hilarious, Mother.  


Shri Mataji: Not hilarious. But what was it?


Sahaja Yogi: He was, he was looking at the back havan. The back havan. It was nothing about [hilarious] and now he’s better. 


Shri Mataji: But I, let Me see your temperature. Come up. I would like to see. Now, he was not that bad. He didn’t have very high temperature, did he? 


Sahaja Yogi: [unclear]


Shri Mataji: But did you find him hilarious or something? What was he saying? Hmm, try one. Getting vibrations? 


Sahaja Yogi: Yes.


Shri Mataji: All right. They are all right. Not much temperature of his. It didn’t come so much temperature as such to get hilarious. So there was big? Temperature cannot be so much then. It’s not so much. Might be ninety nine, might be so, at the most. 


Sahaja Yogi: I don’t think to Spiro was such a problem, Shri Mataji. 


Shri Mataji: What was the problem? Is diarrhea?



Sahaja Yogi: Just the diarrhea and some vomiting, frustration, people feeling weak or... 


Shri Mataji: How many times they’ve gone for diarrhea, how much, on the average?


Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know what the average is. Some, some people had four, five times and other twenty times. 


Shri Mataji: That’s sick, that being sick twenty times. And they had also vomited?


Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Patrice is one of these. Patrice is one we inquired a lot during the night and so on but he’s, he’s improving now, Mother. He’s on [unclear]. He’s improving. 


Shri Mataji: But Patrice needed to be cleared out. Patrice, you have done some other practices isn’t it, in your seeking? Patrice, you’ve done something like that before? And I think drugs. That’s clearing out. It’s good for you. Let it clear out, drugs. 


Sahaja Yogi: Anyone with the fever we, we just suggested they, they sleep on the ground in the shadow, most of their fever to be sucked that way by the earth. And it seems to work. 


Shri Mataji: Yes, we also put the clay on the stomach. It takes out the temperature. It’s a natural way. But I think these drugs and bad gurus and things spoils your, what you call the Void, and then when you come to Sahaja Yoga it just comes out in this way. So let it be cleared out. I think Patrice had problems with his Void. I knew this long time back. 


Sahaja Yogi: Now, we stir up after Your Puja, Shri Mataji [unclear]. So maybe we stir up after Your, after Your Puja. So we are going to reassure that it’s a clearing out and not trying to stop this.


Shri Mataji: No, no, let it be. It’s better. Must be, after Puja if it has happened it’s very good. I think it should happen after Puja.


Sahaja Yogi: But we are just replacing now the case we have, “I can’t improve”. Mr. Patel has been kind enough to supply us with dhahi extra and also black coffee and we are giving this and... 


Shri Mataji: But dhahi in the night won’t be good. 


Sahaja Yogi: In the morning, Mother?


Shri Mataji: Morning, it’s all right. Morning, buttermilk is much better than dhahi also, buttermilk. That’s much more soothing. So if he can make buttermilk, nothing like it. Take more buttermilk. But coffee and buttermilk I don’t know. 


Sahaja Yogi: We can have coffee as a, as a cure for diarrhea or not? Is that recommended, Shri Mataji?


Shri Mataji: I don’t know. This just stops it; that’s all. Take buttermilk. [Hindi] You take some curd. Take battered milk. Battered milk is much better. It soothes you down. Slowly, slowly it will improve. But this coffee just, you see, sort of stops it and augments [no thing]. That’s not very sensible, you see, to give a shock to your system. Coffee is just not a curative. It just stops diarrhea. I don’t know why we should stop it. Let it be cleanse out unless and until you are absolutely very weak. But they say something called electrol here you get it. 


Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we are using that. 


Shri Mataji: That’s good.


Sahaja Yogi: We are also using rice water, perish, when we shall get again Mr. Patel. It is not in our food. He will give us these things also.


Shri Mataji: Yes, you could have lot of water things. I think it’s necessary sometimes to cleanse out. Also drugs, they should get out of your system, very important, very important. If it is there, they should get out. If, if it is happening after My Puja I think it’s stirring up inside. But you just look after that they are gone, they don’t get too much of diarrhea and too much of temperature. But temperature it should, if it is hundred and two I don’t think is much, but if it is more than that then you have to be careful. I was rather concerned, you know, when I came to know about your sickness. And don’t think too much about sickness also. 


Now I have to talk ? please be seated ? to, little bit to the Australians, and because for Me Australians, English, French, all of you are My children and we all should know everything about everything. So there should be no exclusion of Australians or anybody. This can happen to anyone and Australia being such a powerful Sahaja Yogi country that it has happened there, it’s a very sad thing. We have had three shocks, one after another in Australia. And I think there are two types of people in Australia: one type who are all the time very dominating type and try to take over; and there’s another type which is extremely obedient and subservient. They haven’t kept their heads open. You are all Sahaja Yogis and nobody has business to dominate you or to take advantage of you to, or to organize you in that way. Any leader who does that has to pay for it very heavily. And also the part that the wife has to play as the leader’s wife: she has to understand that she is just a mother and she has no authority as a leader’s wife. 


In case of Australia we have had lots of problems because Australians have a special feeling for their wives. I don’t know why. In Sahaja Yoga, otherwise not. I think the greatest temptation they have is to have a family. Australians have this greatest temptation that, “We must have a family. We must look after our family,” this, that. And this might have come because people have seen broken families. They have seen the problems of broken families and there have been so much writings about it that we should not neglect our family, we should look after our children, look after our wives and this and that. Of course, in Sahaja Yoga we respect family very much but not beyond the bigger family.


About James I have to tell you one thing that he gave Me the greatest shock. The first shock came from his cousin whom you know, Terrance, whose wife was Indian but she also in his ego became like a small Mataji. She used to order about, “I will have this. I will not.” They would occupy My room and enjoy there. Then came Mr. Warren. He was another horrid fellow. You see, if such leaders are coming out of that place I am surprised. Then he came here. He never told Me that he was paid money or he collected money, nothing of the kind. I never knew anything. Only once in that I did it, somebody remarked that he has been collecting money. So I asked him, “What money are you collecting?” Without My knowledge he did so many things, and I’ve never known such people before. Though I was telling him, “Your Nabhi is catching, Mooladhara catching,” this, that, but I never knew that there could be people of that level. 


So we had in the same relationship James there. James was a very simple man, no doubt. When he first came to see Me he was very upset. I said, “James why are you upset?” He said, “Mother, I have an air hostess.” I’m telling you all these things because I have to talk with You about it. “An air hostess who is my wife but she doesn’t stay with me. She has to stay in Sydney. I’m working here and I don’t know why she doesn’t write to me much. I go, send her presents, I see her very often, all that.” So I told him, “James, if you don’t mind, I’ll tell you the truth.” He said, “No, no, Mother, please tell me the truth.” I said, “Already she is carrying on with another man. She has nothing to do with you.” And he was shocked. Then I soothed him. I said, “You better call her.” So he went to Sydney and called her and she got herself very nicely dressed, she came for the dinner. And there she openly told him that she’s already living with another man. That’s how he came to Sahaja Yoga. So his first marriage was broken. 


After coming to Sahaja Yoga he wanted to have another marriage. That was all right. Then is this girl, Diane, she wanted to marry him. Now I don’t have any idea about this homosexuality. To be very frankly today I don’t understand what is this nonsense. And that the women are homosexual I’ve never heard of this before. We had never known. I didn’t know that she was that kind of a person. But of course she was not so normal, not so this thing but she was after Me. She wanted to marry Terrance and then to James. I told her, “Terrance is not good for you but James you can marry.” She was after Me that she wanted to get married. “All right,” I said, “you can marry James.” There were not many girls in those days but James wanted to have a wife somehow. So he married this girl. 


Now I have got letters which Mathias has given Me written from his wife who went down. I agree that his wife carried lots of bhoots with him but the fraternity worked and she and other eight girls just jumped on her and formed a formidable group there which I have got now complete record and complete report about them, how they were dominating. They were very hard women, dominating all the rest of them there. And such regulations and rules she started. 


It happened in the beginning when I asked her to get out and go to Ruth because the ladies came and told Me. She went to Ruth. There she knew that she will lose everything. She behave there so nicely, everything. I said, “All right, you go back.” So it was not a possession but a kind of a, that homosexual aggressiveness in her. Then Mathias has given Me her letters when she went, his wife went there. Is absurd letters. She used to sleep with her and she used to hug her. She used to kiss her and do all kinds of things with a lady who has gone there to get cured. And they were very important people. She was a very important person. 


Another person I know is Patrick’s wife. Patrick’s wife, she went down there and she didn’t get better. On the contrary, she became worse. And I told Patrick and Patrick has been there. He was so much influenced by these two persons because they tried to show that all the rest of the world is very bad, they are very unkind, we are very loving people, we are very nice, this, that, and Patrick is something great, you see, just pampered his ego perhaps. Poor fellow, Patrick is such a simple-hearted fellow, he came to France and I was to speak. I had to speak that time. I said, “Patrick, why don’t you translate Me?” He just couldn't utter a word. He was tongue-tied. He said, “Mother, what has happened to me?” He said some honey bees or something has caught him. I said, “No honey bees. This is some Australian honey bees.” 


So one must understand that though the quantity of Australians has increased, quality has to go up. Moreover, a group farming is a very common thing in Australia which is very wrong. When you are increasing this way you must know that you must also increase this way. And all this happened last year when the Indians also reported to Me that Australians are all possessed. I said, “Really?” “Yes, they always sing, ‘Australia is great. Australia is great,’ and they are saying all these things.” And this time they were taking their own decisions. There was one Mr. Charles. He was office head. He was like a Hitler. That’s what the Indians told Me. I was quite shocked. Then they lost the sari, they found the sari and I could see now there’s something going on. 


My attention was not there but on My birthday I telephoned to James because not a single flower came from Australia on My birthday. As it is, I’ve noticed one thing with this lady, his wife, she has been extremely miserly as far as giving presents to Me. I mean, so miserly, it’s so stupid the way. She gave Me a little brooch like this once when I came for Australian tour. She need not have given. And she went where, she sent with this, and even after all this, she sent Me a nylon, a, what you call that is a, for keeping handkerchiefs, a little… Most stupid, she is. She has no sense of any kind. And she was getting from bad to worse. And on this side, you see, when I telephoned from My house, but then James, they said James has gone. Nobody wished Me anything on the phone, nothing. “James has gone to New Zealand.” I said, “All right.” I telephoned to New Zealand. What I find, he didn’t wished Me. I said, “James, do you know, today is My birthday?” ”Oh, yes, yes, yesterday we celebrated in Australia.” “What? You can’t even say it, ‘Mother, happy returns,’ or something?” Not a single flower to Me? As if My photograph has become the reality and I have become unreal. 


See, how this kind of thing works. This is a mass mesmerism. What happened to Hitler can happen to you all; is a mass mesmerism. Because of this lady, she had such a grip over him. I knew this and I told him many times, “You have only one weakness, James, that your first marriage was a failure and you want to show that your second marriage is successful and that’s why you are running after your wife and you are so much at her feet. But know that you are her husband and you are the leader. So you are Sahaja Yogis. You are the temple of God. You are special people.” 


Australia specially has to be very, very careful. And also I think the Indians who went from here were not so good Sahaja Yogis, I must admit. They turned out to be a little bit hanky-panky and not so deep; I agree with you. So the help came from nowhere. So we are just increasing sideways. Then they never consulted Me on anything that they were sending money to Warren. I never knew. I also did not know that they have changed the school from Melbourne. When I saw the photograph of the children they were all, eyes were like this, you see. None of them had straight eyes? little, little babies. I said, “What has happened?” I was so concerned. Then I learned that they have changed the school from Melbourne. Then I learned ? they never asked Me ? to Sydney, because these children were studying in the school. 


So it was all manoeuvred for one family there. And people could not see that. They never told Me that they were moving the school from there. And this gentleman Paul who was running the school himself had a horrible, horrible, horrible wife. He had no children from her, nothing, and she just, she wouldn’t leave Sahaja Yoga. And he was such a slave to her. I don’t know what was in her, that woman, when she was such a catching woman that whenever she came in the room, even outside I could make out that she is there, such a catching person. Right from Mooladhara up to any point. And he never felt her. And very cunning also, very cunning woman. 


She came to Me and she said to Me, “Mother, teach me how to recognize you.” I said, “I’m sorry. I can’t teach you that.” That is the level of people who took over. In Sahaja Yoga I would not put them anywhere, like Diane, like this lady and Paul also. And now Paul and they have joined hands. And James, I think, would like to go out of Sahaja Yoga because he must [stay with/save his] his family which is so precious for him. People do not realize what a tremendous work we are doing today in Sahaja Yoga, what a great thing we are doing. Tomorrow you will be the foundation stones of this great image I have about the golden age of the whole world. You are not ordinary people and you shouldn’t behave like ordinary people. Of course, if there’s anything wrong I can point it out and say it to you but even knowingly something wrong, if you do it how far can I go with you? And this hugging business and this kissing business is just a vulgar thing, I think. There’s no need.


Of course, you can hug when you meet for the first time. From morning till evening if you hug somebody, six times, I mean it’s headache. There’s no need to hug someone all the time and to kiss someone all the time.  What is it? After all, if you meet somebody for the first time you do feel that exuberance of your own expression of love. Then you can hug somebody. And too much regulations in ashram is not allowed. You are all independent, free Sahaja Yogis. You all should grow with your own independence. But it does not mean in any case that you should be rude to your leaders or anything. The leader has to be very fatherly and has to be very righteous and should not play into the hands of his wife. That’s one thing sure.  And then you people have to know that you are all individually Sahaja Yogis. None of these big, big rishis and munis could not give realization that you are giving. You don’t know your powers. You don’t know your position. And if some leader is of that kind you should immediately write to Me. I’m still existing. 


So James has shocked Me the most. I loved him so much. I’ve done so much for him. And he has played into the hands of his wife. I knew one day either he’ll fall this way or that way. His children got terrible diseases. They would have been dead because of this woman. She’s not deep. She has no feelings for Me, nothing of the kind. She would buy very, I could go in the bathroom, I would see very, every time very expensive toilet, I mean what you call them make-ups and… I never use these things, never. So I used to wonder for whom is she buying? Every time I went, she bought something very expensive, something French, Swiss, this, that, kept there, for whom? And she would every time change all the curtains and everything and all that, for whom? I’m just wondering how many do you understand, how many of you can understand that a person without any depth cannot lead you anywhere. Anybody who tries to show off, if you run after that person that means you have not fathomed your own depth. You must know what is your depth. 


And don’t get impressed by somebody because he can dominate you very well and you can go about. Just stand on your own two legs and see for yourself. I don’t believe in any rules and regulations for Sahaja Yogis as such, that you can meet your wife only at this time, husband at that time. You are swachanda; swa is your spirit and chanda is at the disposal of your atma. And when you are that you become absolutely collective also. And these jealousies and these petty-mindedness is not necessary. You are all universal personalities. You have to be that great. You don’t belong to any country. Just to make it convenient, you see, I use the name of the countries, but if I say north, south, east, west, I don’t know how will I [might see/manage it] because the whole system otherwise works this way, that you have [our/your] QANTAS going to Australia, you have this to that, so you have to take to these countries as such, but for Me they don’t exist. Even the directions don’t exist for Me. You are all My children and I just can’t think in that way. 


Please don’t consider yourself. Anyway, even if you are away from Me all My attention is there. And you all can directly write to Me. You can all send Me flowers directly. They said every, the rule was that it is to be done through the leaders. Not at all. You can send Me flowers anytime you want. I mean, My relationship is, “Who are these leaders?” Just it’s a mockery if you understand that; it’s a mockery. One should not in any way think that they stand in between you and Me; not at all. Only thing is if somebody is troublesome or possessed or something, then naturally you can try to keep that person out, but he’s not a Sahaja Yogi in by any chance. 


But otherwise there should be no barrier between you and Me. I’ll not stand it at any cost. No barrier between anyone of you and Me. And you should never feel shy to tell Me and you should always tell Me what’s your problems are, always. I’m always available for you, for everyone of you, each one of you. One should never just decide that, “All right, may Mother may not like.” I may like or not like. It’s not the point. You have to tell Me. I will like it more that you tell Me than not to tell Me and hide things from Me. There’s no official relationship between Me and you. It is a protocol, after all, but protocol doesn’t mean official. Protocol means when you are addressing to Me you can just not call, “Hey, you.” Like that you cannot say to Me.  And even if you say, I wouldn’t mind. I wouldn’t mind after all, but children don’t say that way since certain amount of understanding should be there. And you must feel My love in your heart, that’s all. I don’t want to make anybody unhappy. Sahaja Yoga has come to make you extremely happy, joyous and peaceful. That’s the purpose, not to disturb you by any chance, not to in any way irritate you or make you miserable. 


The other day I’ve said it that those who do not want to continue with their marriages can take the divorces if they are miserable. But without rhyme and reason one should not do that. It should not be a kind of, now a new law, that get divorced. Work it out, work it out, if it is possible. If you can work it out, well and good. If you cannot work it out, then it’s all right. It’s a, more a kind of an experimental thing which one has to work it out. If you work it out properly, you might get children who are realized souls and you will enjoy each other’s company. But it doesn’t happen all the time. If you do not enjoy each other’s company there’s no force on you. I’ll never be angry for that at all. So I would like to know what you want. Even small things if you ask Me I’ll be very happy, anything that you want, anything you would like to tell Me. Little, little, little children if you would see Me, they sit down around Me, we have a conference and they tell Me, “You know, Mataji, what happened,” like that they want to tell Me. So nice to talk to them. 


It’s true nobody’s greater than your Mother but nobody’s greater than My children also. To Me they are very great. So please remember: respect yourself. You are all great Yogis, great people, born to transform the whole universe into a beautiful bloom which is being promised. This is the culmination power, the culmination point where all the prophets, all the incarnations, all the saints have worked very hard to create and there where you have to come up. We have to do everything that is possible to make it a success. And we are quite a lot of people ourselves. 


Now if you have any questions you can ask Me. It will be a good idea, any other questions. 


There’s a girl from Austria, I would like to neutralize her marriage with this Rohan fellow, and we can find somebody for her. All right? Where is she? Can you stand up? All right, that has been neutralized, and we’ll find somebody good for you. All right? May God bless you. 


Then there is somebody  ? Elizabeth from Australia. If you want you can take a divorce with your husband. Who is she? Please stand up. Is she not here? I can’t see her. I see. All right, you can take a divorce if you are not happy with your husband. All right? There is no harm in that. But one should understand that nobody should insult anyone. Maybe there are some disparities, some temperaments and you can marry the one you like but better marry a Sahaja Yogi. If you marry a non Sahaja Yogi it’s a headache for Me then to make him a Sahaja Yogi or this thing, that thing. Anything else? 


Regarding these marriages, anybody has any objections now? Anybody? Please come up. Because after that now I’ll see only when you’ll be dressed as brides and bridegrooms and that’s so beautiful, heavenly, anybody who has. Nate, I think, can you take that out a little [bit], thank you. Anyone? Are you all satisfied? 


Sahaja Yogis: Yes.


Shri Mataji: All are. So may God bless you. Don’t be afraid. Even if you feel shy you can write to Me because there’s a chance, still. If you do not want to marry, better not marry, because you know at random we had to do many things. Then I recollect it, then I again corrected it, then we again collected some names, and it’s lots of things, you see. Poor Yogi has gone thin with it. Even David Spiro has lost some weight. Because I used to change every second day and poor Yogi had to type, sit down, typing again. Then I would change again; he  would type again. Like that it was going on. So if there’s anything like that, you please let Me know. And now we are going to Ganapatipule to enjoy. So forget that you are Australians; forget that you are. You are just universal people. And we are all going to be one and we are going to enjoy ourselves thoroughly in Ganapatipule. And I’ve made all arrangements for you and you can have as much as you like, yours aerated waters if you like or they are going to give you juices as much, free. Nobody has to pay for anything, it’s all free there and there are going to be mango juices, whatever you like. But I think mango juices are not so good for people who have diarrhea. 


Sahaja Yogis: (strong applauses) Shri Nirmala Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki! Jay!


Shri Mataji: No, I’m not frightening. It’s a fact. It’s a fact. You can ask anyone. We know, all Indians know that it’s very hot and that creates heat in the stomach, though it’s very tasty. So they are going to supply you with all kinds of juices, I’ve made all the nice recipes and things I’ve given them.  Baba is going to be there and I hope food will be nice and also they have made nice arrangements with the bathrooms and things. Be careful only that don’t drink any water anywhere. Anyone who wants to stay under the cement can also do it because we have got one or two rooms free. So anybody who wants to stay under the cement can come but it’s better to stay under the sky. I wish I could do Myself. 


So we have got proper arrangements made there. Indians are working very hard and I really don’t know how to thank them.  They are all here so only thing what we can do is to give them a hand. [Strong applause]. Only thing you must make friends with them, talk to them and greet friendly with them. It’s nice because you just come here as guests but after all you should talk to them and meet all of them and you’ll be very happy to know so many things about them. They must be wondering why I am telling you such simple things like, “Don’t take cold water after coming from the sun,” because they all know this very well. So, you see, little, little things they’ll tell you because this is a different country with a different climate. So it’s better you learn from them as one has to learn something in the West about their mannerism and about their styles. 


In the same way you have to learn certain things. So I am sure you all are looking forward to your visit. Tomorrow you all can go to Kolhapur for your purchases and tomorrow, and day after tomorrow if you want to do some purchasing even tomorrow, day after you can do. We can, you see, the buses can leave then at about say one o’clock or two o’clock. [Hindi]. So the, I’m sorry I forgot, [as/S.] Govind, the Jeweller has invited you for lunch so you can have, in the morning if you want go for shopping, you can do it, you come for lunch to his place. He’s so anxious, I told him. He has invited hundred more relations of his to get realization and things. Imagine, he’s a Jain gentleman. He’s such a wonderful person. So he has invited you all. So you will have food at his place ? it’s a vegetarian food  ? and after that you are leaving for Ganapatipule. You’ll reach there quite in the evening. I hope you’ll keep yourself covered properly and don’t take too much dust inside yourself. Try to work it out that you all feel all right by the time you go there. 


Now this is only for the people who have diarrhea. Those who have constipation should not take it. We are going to have nice time, I hope so, looking forward. Moreover I think this time it has been a very dynamic program. I felt people were just stirred up and the, spiritually also the people are very much enriched and it’s quite visible now that people have become very wise and satisfied and settled down and mature. This too somehow or other has been very dynamic, I think, and it has worked very well. 


But still try to meditate in the morning if possible. All of you should do some meditation in the morning. I know we have been sleeping at 4.30. Getting up at 5 o’clock is difficult but nowadays, tomorrow morning you can have a nice meditation and then go for your shopping. So the loading has to be done. [Hindi] So day after tomorrow you have to load your buses. That you can do in the morning time because tomorrow there’s no program as such. No evening program, no music. And then you come back here, sleep well, next day have your meditation and load your buses and go to Kolhapur. If you want to go for shopping you can do it but come for the lunch at about what time. [Hindi] About twelve o’clock you have to be there, twelve or one. And then after lunch you have to leave. So be careful, don’t get lost and understand where you have to go, where you have to meet, what is the place and all of you please arrive there so that there’s no more keeping await. 


May God bless you all. 


VERSION 2

I've heard that you've been all very sick. I think I got sick because of that, Myself. (Shri Mataji laughs) Now I hope you're all better. Still there are sick people? How many?

Answer from a yogi: About seventy

Shri Mataji: Seventy. Seventy are sick in bed? Where are they? Now this is something I must tell you that the other day these girls were making Me wear ornaments and I felt very funny smell from them. So I think that you people do not wash your hands properly. After going to the toilet, I had told you to use water all the time. It's very important. But you people stick still to the Western style. That's very dirty, I tell you. It's a very dirty style of living is not to use the water. It's very unhygienic also. That's why you find in the West most of the people are sick. Not here. You have seen yesterday how the boys were dancing - so quick and fast.

So that's one thing one has to remember is to wash your hands after coming out of the toilet, before food. Yesterday I smelt their hands and I was amazed. Smelling awfully bad. So that's not an Indian custom or anything, but it's a hygienic system. So I hope you have got lotas - have you got lotas there? You had it. But still you keep to that dirty thing with which you have got AIDS, you got all your problems because of that dirty habits. So please try to understand.

Now, in England or anywhere I've seen you use spoons, forks and other things, you see. Don't use directly your hands. When you don't use your hands directly it's all right. But also I think it's a dirty habit in any case. But if you're using forks or spoons or something, at least you're not touching your food with that dirty hands. Only that time I realized that these people have again taken to the bad habits. This paper business is the dirtiest. People - you are so much used to that smell that you do not feel it. But I have seen it even when we have receptions and things, I am sitting there meeting people, or even if I'm shaking hands with them, I feel terrible. The smell is too much in the hands. The sensitivity is lost. You cannot feel the smell. Can you smell your hands now? Let's see.

Do you feel that? It's no need to put any scents or anything, but with the soap nicely. Here in India we use our clay, because clay in India is very good. You can use the clay. Just use the clay nicely and clean your hand. It's very important. And that's why I've seen that in the West everybody is sick all the time, there's something wrong, something ... we never find them healthy. I think this is one of the reasons. Something is always wrong with them. If you, I mean Indians were there, they all had the same food as you ate. Nothing happened to them. And we had made special arrangements for water also. But this is something you're very negligent about.

You have to be very careful. I don't know how you manage. I mean, you can't live without it. Even if supposing we go to some place and there's nothing available, just you have to use the paper sometimes. Even in England sometimes, we come back home immediately and have a bath. So personal cleanliness is very important, anywhere. Here you cannot blame anything to anything, because I've seen people who ate the same food live there. They are quite healthy and hearty. Nothing has gone wrong with them.

We don't also eat too much of raw food. That's also another thing good is that there is no question of thing falling into it. Moreover, even if somebody told Me that the utensils were washed in the lake, doesn't matter. But the food was cooked. You see once you put it on the fire, it's all cleanses out. It cannot give you this sickness.

Then secondly I've seen you're very negligent about also covering up yourself. You must take a shawl all the time. Even if you feel little warm, doesn't matter. But you can take it out, but keep it handy all the time. That's also you get sick, because there's dust everywhere and if you have a shawl around, at least you're protected.

So you should always wear those bundis we have given you. That has come free with the cloth, with the dresses that you have bought. And the ladies must keep their shawls with them. We have to respect our body, because these bodies are not ordinary bodies, they are temples of God.

Thirdly I have been requesting you to put some oil in your heads at least once a week, but now the fashion is not to put any oil. So you don't want to put any oil on your heads. At least once a week you must put some oil in your heads. That will keep your head cool and also before taking bath, use some oil for rubbing on your hands or on your body. We always do that. You people don't have any oil with you? Do you have any oil? Sure? Then please rub it on your body before taking your baths.

You must rub oil on your body nicely before taking your baths. Also I have seen people in the West don't do it, just they never use oil. Before taking bath at least for fifteen minutes rub oil on your bodies. They're very simple things, but you just don't do it. I just don't know. It's few things if you look after, I think you will be all right. And if you are sitting outside, cover your heads. It has been rather cold this time. Winter has been little cooler than before. Reason is it has rained a lot. But I mean compared to your country, it's not cold.

But negligence can cause it. So please keep yourself covered, and then have your baths. If you take bath with cold water, you can never catch cold because the temperature is the same. For a while you'll feel it's cold water, but it's very good. Those people who take bath with cold water ... did you get hot water to have baths? Where?

You had hot water? That's very wrong. That's the reason. That explains. If you have to take bath with hot water, then you must get into your bed. If you have to take it in the open, sure shot you'll get temperature. Absolutely sure shot. This is a very simple thing which I don't know how you don't know. You should never take your bath in the open with the hot water. That's sure shot. I mean, anybody who wants to, you see in the school supposing some boy doesn't want to go. So what he does, he keeps the window open and takes his bath with hot water. Finished. He gets a temperature immediately next day.

So in Brahmapuri if they have given you hot water, you should not have taken bath. That was wrong. Even if you had got, even River Ganges, I don't know how many have been to River Ganges? You have been. Now the water is freezing cold I tell you, it's absolutely freezing cold. When you put your foot you'll just push it back, it's so cold. But people get into it slowly, slowly, they just go, slip into it. And when you come out your cheeks are red like apples. It's so very cold, isn't it? But nothing happens. Nobody catches cold or anything. So in the running water is the cleanest and where you could get in, get into cold water. Otherwise, even if you have to take a hot water bath, take it in the night or may be at the time when you can go off into your bed. In England also people take their baths in the night mostly and get into bed. Supposing you take hot bath in England and go out. Immediately you'll get cancer of the lungs.

Hot and cold is a very important thing one has to know. Like also you can see on the hands you feel hot and cold. So now supposing you have taken the coffee. After that you cannot take anything cold. Is a simple thing one should understand. First you can take anything cold. Like I have seen people take coffee and then ice cream. I'm sure you get troubles - absolutely sure. But if you're taking ice cream, first take ice cream, then take a biscuit and then take some water, then take some biscuit and then you can take something hot. Now supposing you have taken something hot and you have to take water also. Then take three biscuits.

Another very great precaution you have to take which I have seen nobody takes - now it sometimes you come very hot outside. You are sitting down into programs or something, becomes very hot. You are sitting in the sun sometimes and your head gets very heated up. Immediately you go and get cold water. Definitely you'll get sick. No doubt about it. That's the best way to get sick. So if you are sitting in the sun, immediately you should never, never, never take any water till you have eaten something sweet. Take some sugar, or take some jaggery, or some biscuit or something. Even if you are very thirsty, you should not do it.

Little precautions have been taken. Nothing should happen to Sahaja Yogis, because if you get sick, I get sick. That's the problem is, and that's how I was so sick yesterday. I knew that you must be all very sick, that's why it has happened to Me. I mean I work much harder than you people do. Unending meetings are there. I have to meet other people apart from you, give realizations to them, discuss all other organizational problems, this, that - nothing happens to Me. But these precautions must be taken.

Look at these Indians. They are traveling with you. They're all right. Nobody's sick. Why? None of them are sick. You see from our childhood it is taught to us we must wash our hands at least ten times a day. And then too much tea. You people take too much tea. It's very injurious for the intestines, very injurious. It has tannic, you know that. So much tea you people take, it's very wrong. Plus milk with it. Milk gives you diarrhea. Limit your tea taking. Or even if you have to take many cups of tea, then see that it's a very light tea, extremely light, very light tea. But this Marathi tea, only one cup in the morning is sufficient.

Too much tea is very dangerous. I mean it's easily available here. They don't mind even if you have a full drum of a tea, each person; but it's not good for you. Too much tea is not good at all. So limit your tea taking. Also all the time to take tea is not a very good idea. It's some sort of a thing that has happened, I think, is the attention part. Attention. Now ask Indians how many times they take tea, though we grow so much tea here. At the most two times. If they have taken early in the morning tea, they will not have any tea for breakfast; and once in the evening. Finished. If there's a music program in the night, they might take one cup. Because they know because of this tea your stomach goes out of order, you cannot sleep. Is a very wrong thing. But I have seen when I was building My house, or I should say when I was doing renovation of My house, that at the slightest pretext they used to enter into the kitchen, make tea, drink it. Fifteen cups, twenty cups. It's too much. What's the matter with these people? It was cheap to give tea, is all right. Doesn't cost much money. But is very dangerous.

So reduce your intake of tea, and water should be increased. More water, less of tea. Tea itself is not a very good thing. If you see how much your Mother takes tea, you see I may take even ten cups of tea, but so much of tea will be there, for ten cups. Just the water, you see, just to please people I'm taking tea. And no sugar, no milk. That you know very well. Everybody knows. No sugar, no milk. Finished. Milk itself gives diarrhea. Just like that I don't mind with sugar otherwise for liver patients, but not too much of it also. Those who are liver patients can take sugar, otherwise normally you should not take too much sugar, also.

All these little, little things if you look after, you'll be all right.

Tonight I have arranged for them. (Shri Mataji asks a question in Hindi) I hope so. They are arranging some ajwain dhuni. You all should have it. It's a very good thing. Ajwain. Also those who are having diarrhea can have it, it's all right. Just clears you out, completely.

And diarrhea should not make you weak. I mean I normally, in one month's time I have at least twenty days diarrhea. Really. The reason is I take everybody's problems upon Myself and it goes out as diarrhea but doesn't make Me weak. So just the attention is the idea. Diarrhea is important sometimes to cleanse you out. It's important. To Me, it's a relief. Ah, if it is thirty-five motions or forty motions, then it's all right. But three, four motions is very good sometimes.

Also, Indian food is a heavy food. It's not so light as we have English food or Western food is very light. Easy to digest. But Indian food is not. So that's why I ask you to dance, to have some exercises so you can digest it. While we are all having sedentary habits mostly. We are sitting round doing nothing. See, Indians are working, we are not working at all. So we should do little walking or some exercises. It's a heavy food, no doubt. We cannot take it very light. Though I tell them, "Make it very light - no chilies, nothing." They are trying. For example, today's lunch was really too much for Me. It's all right, once in awhile you eat it, and evening time I told them to give you a very simple food.

So that's how it can be compensated: that evening time simple food, day time heavy; or evening time it is heavy, then day time simple food. But Indians are like that, they want, they are fond of, you see they have this fondness to feed you - very anxious to feed you. But don't fall a trap to that.

You should just say, "No, no, no."

But they'll go on saying, "Please have." They feel very happy. They themselves, you should see, they don't eat so much. (laughter) They are very clever. You see them, how much they eat. They'll get up at five o'clock, have their bath, they're ready for everything. In the old days, you see, they eat very little themselves. And you know how much I eat, Myself.

But if it comes to telling people to eat, I'll say, "Please have more. Please have more."

But you should not listen there. As much as you can tolerate, take it. Because you may not be able to digest. I will say because I don't want you to feel embarrassed how to take more, so I'll say, "Go on, eat more." But you should not listen.

I think most of our problems are solved now, as far as marriages are concerned, and perhaps may be one marriage we have to neutralize a little bit, and there's somebody coming also from Simna. I think according to the Western standard, he's a handsome man. You can use him for a model, according to the Western style. But according to Indian style, he is not. (laughter) He's quite a person who looks like all the models I see in Harrod's. It's very surprising, and according to Yogi, he thought he may not be appreciated because of his looks.

I said, "What? See they all have like this only faces. I saw them in Harrod's, so many of them put out as models."

So there's somebody coming down and Yogi is bringing him tomorrow. So there's one more person is coming, and I hope now last minute people don't stand up just to say that, "I want to get married."

Where is Mr. Khan?

Is he not here? Oh, I see, he must have gone somewhere. All right.

I made some medicine for you, for this diarrhea business. But I think one should not pay so much attention to diarrhea. Is better cleanse it out. It's cleansing. But do you feel very weak with diarrhea? Do you?

(a yogi says something about having a high fever for a few days)

High fever. Now he's all right? Temperature has come down? Then put them right to the left. If it is high temperature, put them right to the left. It is diarrhea, then no problems, but diarrhea's all right because it's parasympathetic activity. It's cleansing, you see. I always have diarrhea, I mean, I'll tell you out of thirty days, at least twenty days, minimum, I have diarrhea. But I am quite all right because it's just cleansing out. But if you go on thinking, "I have diarrhea, I've got headache, I have this," then even if you are not sick, you'll feel more sick. One should not pay so much attention. What was the temperature?

Hundred? Hundred is no temperature. It's nothing. Was that hundred and four? Oh, then it's no temperature. It's all right. High fever means hundred and four. Yes it is. But they must have taken ... If you take bath with hot water. You can try, in the open - immediately you'll get hundred temperature. Immediately. It's absolutely inevitable. I don't know how you don't know these things. You don't know, doctor?

(the doctor says something about the food man giving them yoghurt)

Shri Mataji: With the yoghurt what happened?

Doctor: .... Because we got so many within the space of two days, we started to make proper treatment, organize people ... black coffee ...)

Shri Mataji: But diarrhea is not to be feared so much, doctor. And, you see, hundred temperature is no temperature at all.

Doctor: ... some of them hundred one, hundred and two about ...

Shri Mataji: It's all right once in awhile. (laughter from yogis) I always ... So many times if I feel My temperature, I'll go mad. It's nothing. You see, temperature is there because of the heat, something. A hundred and two is nothing. It's like it's not something to be reported.

I personally think that way, you see. We, Indians, for us hundred and two is no temperature. You people are very delicate. I must say very delicate health you have. You saw the boys how they were dancing. You saw the way they were doing things. You see, life is so active. The body is ... the lethargic nature, you see, makes you so delicate. You saw yesterday how they were doing all that. That's very common. I also used to learn all that. We all have to learn. So you keep your body moving and this thing. I mean, you'd go to a college even if you have a hundred and two temperature. Nothing, it's not much.

But you're very delicate and bearing power is less. I think so. Hundred and four, of course we start worrying. But hundred and two is not much. I thought you are so sick that it's hundred and six. Really I got worried. But for that you just put left to the right, you'll be all right. This is because of not using proper precautions. Now don't take hot bath in the open. Just this much you try. There's no harm in getting into cold water. Cold is always good. Always get into cold water. Take your bath in the cold water. Never get ... you'll never catch cold. See, when I was in India I always use absolutely cold water. But when I went to England everybody told Me, "You can't do that way." Just forced Me to take hot water and I started getting cold. Otherwise I never get cold. So hot water should be used - all right use the hot water, then get into your beds. That's the best way to get into temperature. I tell you. Just avoid hot water bath. But if you take hot water bath, see to it that you take the hot water bath and after that you get into your beds. No exposure. All right?

We made a medicine, it doesn't look very interesting but it won't taste bad. For diarrhea only. Not for everyone, only those who have diarrhea.

Also if you can remember one thing more, is to when you come out of these processions you just gargle with little warm water, or even ordinary water. Gargle out. So the dust will come out. There may be a dust, you're not used to the dust. That's also another reason you get this coughing.

Are they here, those who have temperature? Not here. Can you see if they have temperature now?

I was worried the way it was told to Me I thought, "Some sort of an epidemic has come, or what?" (laughter) Really, like plague, you know, the description was so horrible. (laughter)

Some of you have had some gurus, you see, and that's why also the Void acts, very fast. They must be the first time they must be visiting, most of them. And they must have this guru trouble and the Void must be showing off.

So must be temperature cannot be so much there. It's not so much. Ninety, ninety-nine, it may be so at the most.

Doctor: I don't think fever was such a problem, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What was the problem, is diarrhea?

Doctor: Just the diarrhea and some vomiting and frustration, people feeling weak and so on.

Shri Mataji: How many times for diarrhea?

Doctor: Some people had it four or five times. Some had it twenty times.

Shri Mataji: That's sick. That means sick, twenty times. And they had also vomiting?

Doctor: Yes.

Shri Mataji: And I think drugs. That's clearing out, it's good for you. Let it clear out. Drugs.

Doctor: Anyone with a fever, we just suggested they sleep on the ground in the shade and let the fever be sucked out by the earth. And it seems to have worked.

Shri Mataji: We also put the clay on the stomach to take out the temperature. It's a natural way. But I think it's drugs and bad gurus and things spoils your, what you call the Void. And then when you come to Sahaja Yoga it just comes out in this way.

Doctor: ... stirred up after Your Puja, Shri Mataji. That's when a lot of them actually started after Your, after Puja. So we naturally assume that it's a clearing out and we're not trying to stop it.

Shri Mataji: No, let it be, it's better. Must be, after Puja if it has happened, it's very good. I think it should happen, after Puja.

Doctor: We're just replacing now the .... I can't ... Mr. Patra has been kind enough to supply us with dahi Extra and also black coffee and we're giving this ...

Shri Mataji: But dahi in the light won't be good. Morning is all right. Morning buttermilk is much better than dahi, also, buttermilk. That's much more soothing. So if you can make buttermilk, nothing like it. Take more buttermilk. But coffee and buttermilk, I don't know.

Doctor: Can they have coffee as a fuel for the diarrhea or not? What do You recommend, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: I don't know. That's toxic, that's all. Take buttermilk. With Isabgol take buttermilk. Buttermilk is much better. It soothes you down. Slowly, slowly it will improve. But this coffee, just you see, it sort of stops it. Augments the whole thing. That's not very sensible, you see, to give a shock to your system. Coffee is just not a curative. It just stops diarrhea. I don't know why you should stop it. Let it be cleansed out, unless and until you're absolutely very weak. There's something call Electrol here, you get it.

Doctor: We're using that.

Shri Mataji: That's good

Doctor: And also we're using rice water, when we can get it. Again Mr. Patra has been kind enough to give us this also.

Shri Mataji: You put a lot of water, things. I think it's necessary sometimes to cleanse out. Also drugs - they should get out of your system, very important, very important. If it is there, it should get out. If it is happening after My Puja it is stirring up inside. But you just look after they don't get too much of diarrhea, and too much of temperature. But temperature, if it's a hundred and two, I don't think it's much. But if it is more than that, then you have to be careful.

I was rather concerned, you know, that he came to Me about your sickness. Don't think too much about sickness, also.

Now I have to talk little bit to the Australians, because for Me Australians, English, French - all of you are My children. And we all should know everything about everything. So there should be no exclusion of Australians or anybody. This can happen to anyone and Australia being such a powerful Sahaja Yogi country that it has happened there, a very sad thing. We have had three shocks, one after another in Australia. I think there are two types of people in Australia. One type who are all the time very dominating type, and try to take over. And there's another type which is extremely obedient and subservient. They have kept their heads open. You are all Sahaja Yogis, and nobody has business to dominate you or to take advantage of you, to organize you in that way. Any leader who does that has to pay for it, very heavily. And also the part that the wife has to play as the leader's wife, she has to understand that she's just a mother and she has no authority as a leader's wife.

In case of Australia we have had lots of problems, because Australians have a special feeling for their wives - I don't know why - in Sahaja Yoga, otherwise not. I think the greatest temptation they have is to have a family. Australians have this greatest temptation that "We must have a family, we must look after our family," this, that. And this might have come because people have seen broken families. They have seen the problems of broken families, and there have been so much writings about it that we should not neglect our family, you should look after your children, look after wives and this and that. Of course in Sahaja Yoga we respect family very much, but not beyond the bigger family. People do not realize what a tremendous work we are doing today in Sahaja Yoga - what a great thing we are doing. Tomorrow you will be the foundation stones of this great image I have about the golden age of the whole world. You're not ordinary people. And you shouldn't behave like ordinary people. Of course if there's anything wrong, I can point it out and say to you. But if even knowingly something wrong if you do it, how far can I go with you?

And this hugging business and this kissing business, is just a vulgar thing, I think. There's no need. Of course you can hug when you meet for the first time. But morning till evening if you hug somebody six times, I mean, it's a headache. There's no need to hug someone all the time, and to kiss someone all the time. What is it? After all, if you meet somebody for the first time, you do feel that exuberance of your own expression of love, then you can hug somebody. And too much regulations in ashram is not allowed. You're all independent, free Sahaja Yogis. You all should grow with your own independence. But it does not mean in any case that you should be rude to your leaders or anything.

The leader has to be very fatherly and has to be very righteous and should not play into the hands of his wife. That's one thing sure. And then you people have to know that you are all individually Sahaja Yogis. None of these big, big rishis and munis could not give realization as you are giving. You don't know your powers. You don't know your position. And if some leader is of that kind, you should immediately write to Me. I'm still existing. I am just wondering how many of you can understand that a person without any depth cannot lead you anywhere. Anybody who tries to show off, if you run after that person, that means you have not fathomed your own depth. You must know what is your depth. And don't get impressed by somebody because he can dominate you very well and he can go about. Just stand on your own two legs and see for yourself.

I don't believe in any rules and regulations for Sahaja Yogis as such - that you can meet your wife only at this time, husband at that time. You are swachchhanda - swa is your Spirit and chchhanda is at the disposal of your Atma. And when you are that you become absolutely collective also. And these jealousies and this petty mindedness is not necessary. You are all universal personalities. You have to be that great. You don't belong to any country. Just to make it convenient, you see, I use the name of the countries. But if I say, "North, South, East, West," I don't know how will I manage it. Because the whole system otherwise works this way that you have Qantas going to Australia, you have this to that. So you have to take to these countries as such, but for Me they don't exist. Even the directions don't exist for Me. You are all My children, and I just can't think in that way. Please don't consider yourself any way, even if you're away from Me, all My attention is there. And you all can directly write to Me, you can all send Me flowers directly. They said the rule was that it is to be done through the leaders - not at all. You can send Me flowers any time you want to. I mean My relationship is - who are these leaders? Just it's a mockery if you understand that, it's a mockery.

One should not in any way think that they stand in between you and Me, not at all. Only thing is if somebody's troublesome or possessed or something. Then, naturally, you can try to keep that person out. But he's not a Sahaja Yogi by any chance. But otherwise there should be no barrier between you and Me. I'll not stand it, at any cost - no barrier between any one of you and Me. And you should never feel shy to tell Me. You should always tell Me what your problems are. Always. I'm always available for you, for every one of you, each one of you.

One should never just decide that "All right, may Mother may not like." I may like or not like, is not the point, you have to tell Me. I will like it more that you tell Me than not to tell Me and hide things from Me. There's no official relationship between Me and you. It is a protocol, after all, but protocol doesn't mean official. Protocol means when you're addressing to Me, you can just not call, "Hey, You." Like that, you cannot say to Me. (laughter) And even if you say, I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind, after all. But children don't say that way.

See certain amount of understanding should be there, and you must feel My love in your heart, that's all. I don't want to make anybody unhappy. Sahaja Yoga has come to make you extremely happy, joyous and peaceful. That's the purpose, not to disturb you by any chance, not to in any way irritate you or make you miserable. The other day I have said it, that those who do not want to continue with their marriages can take the divorces if they are miserable. But without rhyme and reason, one should not do that. If you do not enjoy each other's company, there's no force on you. I'll never be angry for that, at all.

So I would like to know what you want. Even small things, if you ask Me, I'll be very happy. Anything that you want, anything you would like to tell Me - little, little children, you should see Me, they sit down round Me, we have a conference and they tell Me, "No, Mataji, what happened like that we want" are telling Me. So nice to talk to them.

It's true, nobody's greater than your Mother; but nobody's greater than My children also. To Me they are very great. So please remember - respect yourself. You are all great yogis, great people, born to transform the whole universe into a beautiful globe which is being promised. This is the culmination point, culmination point where all the prophets, all the incarnations, all the saints have worked very hard to create, and there where you have to come up. We have to do everything that is possible to make it a success. And we are quite a lot of people, ourselves.

Now if you have any questions, you can ask Me. Would be a good idea.

And now we are going to Ganapatipule to enjoy. So forget that you're Australians, forget that - you are just universal people. And we are all going to be one, and we are going to enjoy ourselves thoroughly in Ganapatipule. And I have made all arrangements for you and you can have as much as you like, your aerated waters if you like. Or, they are going to give you juices as much, free. Nobody has to pay for anything, is all free there, they are going to give you mango juices, whatever you like. But I think mango juice is not so good for people who have diarrhea. (laughter and applause)

No, I'm not frightening, it's a fact. It's a fact. You can ask anyone. We know, all Indians know that it's very hot, and it creates heat in the stomach. Though it's very tasty. So they are going to supply you with all kinds of juices. I made all the nice recipes and things I've given them. Baba is going to be there, and I hope food will be nice. And also they have made nice arrangements with the bathrooms and things. Be careful only that don't drink any water anywhere. Anyone who wants to stay under the cement can also do it because we have got one or two rooms free. So anybody who wants to stay under the cement can come, but is better to stay under the sky. I wish I could do Myself.

So we have got proper arrangements made there. Indians are working very hard, and I really don't know how to thank them. They are all here, so only thing what we can do is to give them a hand.
(applause)
