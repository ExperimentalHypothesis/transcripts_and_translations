Mysteriously, we’re all amazed that is there. They told them they are humbled to send my Mother and sisters but I am not going to be able to come.

5:59 Just ____ it, is he Brazilian?

Yogi: right

Mother: Cincinnati was also another very good experience. lot of people came. And it was in an open park. They thought it might rain, that why perhaps many could not come but still they were about 200 people. And the sweet children came about 10-8 years old. We enjoyed your lecture, enjoyed your lecture. (making like how the kids said it)

So, one was like this (mother pass her hands through her right side of her head)

I said but what did I say? That we don’t know but we enjoyed it

All laughing

Very sweet and then the fourth one came in, and just jumped on me and hug me and kiss me

See I enjoy what you’ve done. I’m feeling very happy I don’t know why I’m feeling very happy.

So, I think the vibratios are already felt.

Yogi: Mother, would you take cream and sugar?

Mother: No, nothing. Just clear tea 7:23 

The Indian things are nice sturdy, but they are very heavy

Yogi: you know what happened to the tea set Mother, we polished it, and we polished too much, and the solution was too strong and the Silver started to come off. And it’s brass in it, isn’t it?

Mother: who put brass to this?

Yogi: I don’t know.  We didn’t mean to do that but it’s very wrong.

Mother:  well, you see they don’t do it very well in India. I think so.

Yogi: do you think we should you have it redone in here?

Mother: it can be done anytime, honey 8:11 UNCLEAR

Yogi: pardon

Yogis: vibrations very good

Mother:  Vibrations

These are not these are not but maskcade might be a little bit different

UNCLEAR

It’s very nice you see

All you can see that

They are so fine

UNCLEAR

You see in England, there are many students who are doing art. They have no way to pay their tuition, so they

UNCLEAR

Mother: Vibrations are there. That’s the main point.

Yogi: yes

Mother: I selected all these and lost my watch. I don’t know how, first time, I mean, it’s an old watch of mine. maybe in the house I don’t know.

Low volume till 16:56

So, when we reached there. They said Mother the moment your car arrived the last UNCLEAR 17:00 rug was put

Yogi: yes

Mother: you were there?

Yogi: no, I heard that they were just putting the carpets as you were coming up the stairs, they were putting them down

Mother: so, I said all right, so then my husband realized that why I was delaying all this 

I was doing UNCLEAR 

But the way people are they will always arrive before time nowadays I think, they are so speedy as soon as you take the name

UNCLEAR I mean, I have to go but the rest of the people are all jumping at me. I have to go, you don’t have to go. Why are you jumping? Everybody gets so excited. Once it happened that see this boy had a bad habit of taking me into the airport one hour early. So, one day see I got very annoyed with him, and I said, what is this? why are you bullying me all the time to go there one hour earlier for what? UNCLEAR 

So, he said oh we must go early, and my husband supported him. I said to them you go ahead of time one hour or two hours whenever you want to go

Driver: it’s all right, I’ll take the luggage

Mother: I said take the luggage and do the luggage

So, then I asked Dr. Spiro UNCLEAR 

We had a second car; it was not so good in the sense that it was old. but driving very slowly Dr. Spiro said Mother 

I don’t know why I am enjoying this nature very much. I never enjoyed this nature.

I said good

So I went to the airport, started after one hour.

Do you use my tea isn’t it?

Yogi: yes Mother

Mother: but I think you know, it’s rather strong. Use very little because it’s just for 9:12 UNCLEAR

This one is all right but the second one use less

Be careful.

So, we reached the airport, and they inquired us 19:32 UNCLEAR no body has shown up, so

Where is warden 19:39 UNCLEAR

All laughing

So, there was I think graha markham you see Mother they called me here and we making here for one hour

I said really, I never saw him

After 15 minutes we saw him pushing the trolley

Looked at me and said how are you here?

And I said I am here I came after one hour definitely

Dr. Spiro started laughing

he said but how is it that we missed you?

I said did you come back to see me here? It’s only one road I must have jumped over you otherwise.

All laughing

He couldn’t understand how they were so late

Talking Hindi

21:18 UNCLEAR is very simple very childish, a child like I asked her you must forgive, and she said from where do you do that?   How do you do it? From which part of the world?

UNCLEAR 21:31

All laughing

Yogi: is this the first time she’s traveled with you, Mother?

Mother: no, she has travelled before also

Yogi: in North America

Mother: she is, in this side she is not for the first time

UNCLEAR

She is been somewhere UNCLEAR she was telling me

Yogi: Switzerland

Mother: Ah to Switzerland

But they came separately with my daughter and stayed in a motel or something

UNCLEAR 

They’re saying that Sahaja yogis are very nice and very friendly, but the rest of the people are not very friendly type as they are in India. UNCLEAR 22:56

And the smallest job they will be doing I don’t know they think they are all UNCLEAR even the smallest possession. To be humble is sort of UNCLEAR disqualification or what 

Yogini: Can I close this window?

Mother: Oh yeah

To be humble is UNCLEAR 23:50

But worst are British air 24:12 UNCLEAR British airways are the worst of all of them. Talking in very funny way

Yogi: you mean the stewards

Mother: all of them. Too much of UNCLEAR 24:35

In India, food is not good. Everything is funny.

people like to go and buy in India because services are good UNCLEAR 24:53 people are gentle and nice. People are trained that way. Business means that. Here the train is not there, or I don’t know what. Very rude. How is it that people have suddenly become so rude in the west?

Yogini: I think it’s weird

Mother: everybody is UNCLEAR 25:33 on them actually 

Yogi: they are aggressive, so they don’t get hurt, to protect themselves

Mother: a question- who is going to hurt them?

Yogini: each other. That’s what it seems.

Mother: so always hurt each other. That’s a competition.

Yogini: a competition

Mother: like French.

Yogini: yes

UNCLEAR 26:35

Businessman has lots of ego, but they put up at least to show being humble because they have to do business

Humble, at least for business’s sake

Ego is ego, very funny type of ego

There is nothing like bad manners.

Mother speaking Hindi

So, they have finished my dinner so you all can also have food.

So, what is the program tomorrow is Puja and then?

Yogini:  UNCLEAR 27:35 Harrish would like to go to Victoria, well you know that. To Victoria in the afternoon.

We have no interviews planned. We had one that almost became a reality, but they canceled at the last minute. They said there is something like UNCLEAR Blue Mai is here

Mother: She is here?

Yogini: today and tomorrow I believe so they wanted to do a coverage to compare the two.  you and this other lady.

Mother: both of us together?

Yogini: I don’t know what they have in mind, but they said she would not cooperate so they would not do any, they would not come and interview you then

Mother: she would not cooperate with what? She is so frightened of me.

She is a businesswoman. Why they don’t understand that.

Yogini: I tried to. I asked them why and I said if Shri Mataji have come by herself would you then interview her, and they said well we don’t know we interviewed her last time that she was here. She is not really news this time. and I said well, she is very much, you should appreciate her position, who she is, in political who her husband is ...etc and they said yes yes we understand all that but for our public is not really news I don’t understand why? I argue with him. I tried to get him in to change.

yogini: Wills

Yogi: Wills said the difference between her guru and the followers of 29 years old guru Mai...31:04 is that they charge a lot of money, and we don’t charge anything we cannot wake up the kundalini by charging money .it has to be something that is free. But the US Advance team of guru Mai visiting Vancouver has no trouble with the $300 price tag 31:19 for a guru 2-day workshop will begin on the 17 th...31:23 I spent most of my time promoting guru Mai said devotee Chilton Pearce author of “The crack in the cosmic egg” as a magical turn.

He has written another book called the Magical Child and he spoke to about 400 people in Bronx square last Friday leading after the gurus Mai’s arrival.... UNCLEAR 32:07

Another yogi: check your teachers.

to disciples. The bridges also said guru Mai embodies divine love in its completeness and unceasingly bestow that boundless grace upon those that come to her

Sorella Troy who travels all around the world for promoting Guru Mai workshop said when I look at $300

Mother: it’s paid very heavily; it’s paid very heavily this man. You see, this gentleman has many many money oriented fellows and they really pay for it and same thing happens to her father and there is a horrible article about him and his own  person , the one who worked for him has given all the details about him and one day this fellow will also announce, see, I’m sure this man will also come out with the same kind of article about him.

Yogi: this is UNCLEAR

Mother: you have seen that one?

Yogi: yes Shri Mataji, I went with David Spiro to see this woman in London when she came

Mother: David Spiro

Yogi: yes, David and I went. We went with the lemons and chillies in our pockets, to see guru Mai and it was extraordinary. They had the whole theatre in illusion, and they had laser beams which read guru Mai we love you on the screen and there were people they were people dress in orient with shaved head like getting their new ordeal, ready for her arrival and what they did is that they actually chanted Om Namah Shivaya over and over and over again, and they have to few very famous singer. Someone stood up and sang amazing Grace and they were chanting Om Namah Shivaya and she walked in, and she walked in dressed in a red dress or a red robe and she walked down while they carried on chanting. And then she, It was extraordinary. David and I had to leave but it was like a poppet, talking.

Mother: Ah

Yogi:  She was like a little poppet talking about, she would say something from the Gita and then she started singing and it was a theatre. It was nothing being said, and there were no vibrations. it was like a dead room that was full of, it was a performance. It was just like a theatre, and we left. It was just nothing to stay for other than it was very spectacular, it was very slick presentation and it was a lot of electronic equipment

Mother: what do you need for a natural thing? You don’t need all these things actually, there was a lady who came from her group who attended her programs in Rome and there she charges also $300 and this poor girl you know she came and as soon as I saw her, I asked her where have you been, she said why she said I have not slept and I am in a very big mess now, so I said what happened? She said I went to this guru Mai, I collected 300 pounds some or other, went to the program and she is like I am sickening

Mother: I said you better go and tell the newspaper?

So, they don’t care she said because they are paid well

Yogi: when she was asked about the money, this guru said $300 is nothing compared to what I got out of it. The workshop changed my whole life. If somebody ask me how much money I would have be paid to have Shaktipat taken away I said, a rather be dead

Mother: Ah

Yogi: I rather be dead than having taken away the Shaktipat

Mother: Better be dead?

Yogi: Than having the Shaktipat taken away from her

Hindi speaking

UNCLEAR 

Mother: I mean, they mesmerized them so much that’s what her father did, but this fellow UNCLEAR 37:20 is exposing very much but still people can stick to such a people

What to do? Actually, one gets what one deserves.

it’s the ego of money

Yogi: yes Mother. We thought maybe you arrange this so the bad people go to her, and the good ones would come to us

Mother: she has very well paid people very well paid and they’re all go ahead of her to place and my brother was that time posted in Arun abate was 38:15 UNCLEAR a court judge they went to his house and what they do they go to any place to find out who are the most important people and they want to meet them and say they want to invite you, will do these to such a person and such and such so they went to talk to him also that there is a very guru is coming to this place she’s a child prodigy, this that and she does this and so my brother said All right be seated and I will get do some tea or something . He went inside and they lifted up their eyes and saw my photographs as soon as he came, she said, what is Shri Mataji doing in here?

He said she’s my sister. Oh, your sister yes immediately they packed up. They know the truth you see but the thing that until they can make money. Why not me?

Yogi: There was also a scandal with her brother, guru Mai’s brother because there was a big fight as to who move to Nando UNCLEAR 39:28 after the actually pass of a relative

Mother: they are these illegitimate children both

Yogi: Are they?

Mother: mm UNCLEAR the Secretive was one to be decide who came to Rajej and he told. He was a very dirty man UNCLEAR 39:48 very dirty man

And these are his childrens, doing Shaktipat. Very useless.

Yogis talking in the background

Yogi: Did he said he call, or should we let him know when he wakes up.

Yogini: he said actually was his wife or is his wife?

Yogi: sister

Yogini: sister, she said they were going out and will call

Yogi: I see, okay

Mother: but you see I only feel that whatever one deserves one get. Now, there has been so many tesis against this UNCLEAR 40:38 in the newspaper 

still people go to him what can you do if they want to ruin themself what can I do? They are cases against him about how UNCLEAR 40:55 still the case is on, everything said about him, nothing goes into the head of the people still they want to go it’s like they see people coming out like a poppet and falling out and again go in competition and fall out. It is like that, there is no wisdom.

So, I feel we should not get too much quantity. Just grab a quality not for a quantity because quantity will spoil the quality and if you have, please have your food, if you have someone, one person like Abraham Lincoln that can do a lot. but they tried to do so many things against us. So many things.

Relish is now that’s what he told me UNCLEAR and it was a hoax and I play on to them I was an intelligent man to make money I make money, so what? still people are coming to him Germans and Japanese

Yogini: where is he now, Mother?

Mother: He is in Pune. In a very bad shape, he has some very funny thing from Mooladhara so the heat is coming and from his Mooladhara, so he has made a special chair of Maple which has holes and down below is air conditioner, and he cannot move about for more than 5-6 minutes. All the time glu glu

I don’t know what such a type of disease is that can you you tell

Yogi: it’s interesting, because just yesterday I saw something like 20 or 30 of his followers with this little photograph and a pledge 44:03 UNCLEAR outside the hospital in London, and they were all coming out of these private very expensive private hospital in London. I just wonder whether he was in there.

Mother: you saw them coming out

Yogi: they were all coming out from the crown well 44:19 UNCLEAR hospital very near where I was, yes, and they were all walking towards cars

Mother: they were discharged I don’t know

Yogi: I just, they look like they were visiting someone I was wondering whether he’s been ill for quite some time

Mother: you should find out from the doctors

Yogi: they won’t say, Shri Mataji they won’t. It’s unethical 44:45

Mother: UNCLEAR he wouldn’t say but the doctor will tell

Yogis laughing

Yogi: I can find out

Yogi: maybe

Mother: I tell you what I know a servant he’s very old servant man excellent cook he was about UNCLEAR 45:02 80 years of age  when he came to London very healthy very good when he came here  I don’t know some funny English lady old lady fell in love with him somewhere, and he used to go to her and serve her then suddenly he felt very sick and UNCLEAR so he went to the doctor and the doctor sent him to the hospital somewhere quite far away so he had to go every Tuesday and Friday there, so far away and he was taking some injections medicine actually what’s wrong with him i said I don’t know  I don’t know so there was a colleague of mine. I mean in the sense that we were studying together. She was there, she is a doctor.  I telephoned to her actually to see what this hospital is supposed to be and she said why and I told her UNCLEAR 46:13  this is for....I said, could you find out what’s wrong with this particular  She said I have a friend that I can telephone to and she told me some thing very horrible about it and then we discovered all these things that he got it from this lady, but this lady was so bad that she said to ask a question in the parliament about him they asked the question why she has to go from him she gave funny ideas to him it’s all right doesn’t matter, but this is how it works out like if you ask the doctor if you have any friends there, they might tell you

Yogi: I am sure I can find out

Yogi: They don’t even reveal the register where the patient checked in to stay in the hospital

Mother: mm, what is it?

Yogi: I said you can’t even find out who has checked in as a patient

Another yogi: They want to keep it secret if somebody famous goes into the hospital. Yes, they keep it secret, but I know quite a lot of nurses who work there, I can ask them innocently.

Yogi: Maybe he had to leave Pune because it gets so hot he has to survive in temperature between 15-17 degrees centigrade. Anything more than that he starts to die.

Mother: he lives in Pune?

Yogi: no, that’s what I mean, he has to be maintained at a temperature below 17

Mother: but you said he lives in Pune?

yogi: well, He might have left because it became quite hot in Pune last month and maybe he came to England for treatment.

Another yogi: I have no idea there is always people Unclear 48:02

Mother: He might, yeah.

Another yogi: maybe there aren’t any good medical facilities there

Yogi: I’ll find out

Mother: normally no country allows me to come in

Imagine he was arrested he was in jail, all these too happened and still people go to him. They pay such a lot of money to him. He is very rich. Even this fellow Tanan had diamonds, 600 Carozza Mother speaking in another language

Yogi: Mother 6 thousand carroz actually

Mother: 6 thousand million

Yogi: no, more. In dollars it would be

Mother: millions

6 hundred carroz is 6 thousand million

Yogi: let me see10 hundred ...

Mother: 60 thousand million

Yogi: 10 million is a crowd. 10 million is one crowd and he has 6 thousand crowds

Mother: 60 thousand, ah

Yogi: 6 thousand million

Mother: 6 thousand

Yogi: and in dollar it would be 600 million. 6 hundred million dollars

Mother: it’s too much

Yogi: imagine the way she is going even in Rome she is charging the same thing $ 300 dollars and that to 3 thousand people

UNCLEAR
Mother: in America, they just discovered about her

People came and Mother makes a welcoming sign to them and talks in another language

Mother: six million. I don’t know what it is. I am so bad at it.

that’s only in India. UNCLEAR 50:21 Easiest way to get money. done an enterprise, become a false guru. Finish. And people are so stupid. somebody said that they make you fly in the air, just think of it

 I asked them these TM people but how do you take to it they said that If you have to grow, you have to go on these courses so like they said they c...carrot 51:14 UNCLEAR to a bull and from one to another, to another to another so the sidhi produce sidha course then UNCLEAR 51:20 they spiritually should be much higher UNCLEAR 51:25 all your problems will be solved

as it is there are so UNCLEAR 51:26 excessive suffering from epilepsy all kind of diseases so they said they will all be cured once you take this

Yogi: They are saying they don’t call sidha anymore because in French

Mother: what?

In French Sidha means aids so they call it sidh, sidhi or because

Mother: 51:44 UNCLEAR

Yogi: AIDS written in French is sidha

Another yogi: they stopped calling that

Yogi: yes, they stopped calling it that, they drop the A 51:52.... UNCLEAR

Mother: really?

Laughing

Mother: That’s exactly what it is

I mean, you would be surprised all the 8 Persians which came to us were doing TM?

So how is it related to that?

Also, they were not allowed to see the women they were forced to keep out of women. There were curtains put for husband and wife also. they could not meet each other.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, is there a reason why the divine has worked out that you are here in Vancouver at the same time of this 52:50 UNCLEAR. (level carpet) this money-making (Unclear 52:52 technicity) machine people

Mother: I don’t know. I think is the other way around. That all of these come up and then the divine has to come

Laughing

Yogi: in Rome, she proceeded there for a week, this time, yeah, when the program was there after sahastrara day

Mother: Mmm

Yogi: some people came to your program damaged by this who has paid $300 to her in Rome

Mother: even in Barcelona we had (talking Hindi) Madrid we have got addresses of these people. Also, we have some people in turkey. 53:50 UNCLEAR they did even spread Turkey. Anywhere you go they are there. It’s just like plastic and penetrate into anything these false gurus can penetrate. They are known every where.

Yogi: in Barcelona, we had a seeker, and the program was cancelled, the sahastrara UNCLEAR 54:08 bandhan there on top and he got his realization there.

Mother: who

Yogi: The same people, he got canceled of the sahastrara from in Barcelona that old man Shri Mataji. He is following this person

Mother: the photographer? UNCLEAR 54:29

Yogi: on the first night he had this UNCLEAR 54:35 he said he has cancer of the brain and

Mother: Ahhh

He was following this fellow

Yogi: this yogi, autobiographer

Mother: self realization business

Yoga Ananda

Yogi: Yoga Ananda.

Yogis talk in the background

Mother: I know who he is

Yogini: would you like some more of the shells Mother?

Mother: Ah?

Yogini: Some more of the shells?

Mother: no no. I have eaten quite a lot of that

Yogini: Okay

Yogi: I’ve met some people in London, who who know these women this 44:45 Ananda they are actually very attractive people, one of them is a very... UNCLEAR 55:54 hairdresser married to a woman who is a singer called lulu who used to be a big star in the 1960s. And they know a friend of mine someone who I worked with as a doctor, that’s how I got to know them and it’s very interesting how they work because it works around like fashion. It’s fashionable to be, and they actually got some quite attractive very intelligent professionals people throughout this meeting but they are doing it rather as sniffing cocaine you know is the next fashion.  You know they actually going along because they presented it well, and they looked like something that was Ah, they wanted to be part of. but it was so superficial on a vibrational level, it was non-existent. In fact, it was quite painful.

Mother: but you see people are so much impressed by these artificialities. What to say. But the other day I met in Toronto very nice, enlightened lady. She’s a 57:07 UNCLEAR radio-mixting? She’s very good I must say. She was very open, and she asked me very positive questions and she asked me everything as

What is the solution of this and when I gave her the answers she was really amazed. She said that why we have ecological problem and I said because man is not in balance, has lost his balance. See. Going after transitory things beyond his own limitations. That’s why. So how can you bring man into balance I said by the scriptures on the spiritual UNCLEAR 57:57

She said she is being having series of my lectures broadcasted. She came to the program also later on with her friends. She got her realization; they were sitting before me. 

Yogi: she has reading a lot of articles and uk western problems and nature

Mother: She asked me why people are killing children, I said because they are against innocence now. Once you become materialistic, they don’t like innocence at all. it’s surprising they have respect for Mahatma Gandhi. And Mahatma Gandhi was such a simple, straightforward man. Absolutely. on one side, you have respect for that and on the other side you go for artificial things there. this lady must be using all discotheque style. 59:18 UNCLEAR

Yogi: it’s it’s very, mmm, it was like a  discotheque. Exactly. It was like a discotheque with flashing lights, and then a little bit of Bhagava Gita, a little bit of

Mother: but doctor I can understand Indians are attracted to things like that because they haven’t seen it but why foreigners who have seen it everyday? Why do they? UNCLEAR 59:49 

Yogi: I think they were attracted Shri Mataji because it was presented with ahead (the hell of these) all these books that ...ananda (UNCLEAR name) had written UNCLEAR 01:00:00 and they have a massive restaurant that they called how do they called it? Not,, they called it What do we? What do we .. Ambridge, they have a restaurant that its called Ambridge and it has a little vegetarian dishes and things and they picked a very few famous people in there like a singer in there and then

Mother: why do they, they must have people to go to restaurants? You see, one thing that I don’t understand why should they be attracted? First thing which they themselves do. I mean musicians themselves arrange all the discotheque and all that, they can do it themselves. What is so special?

Yogi: UNCLEAR 1:00:54 has opened in Germany sorba the Greek and here the discotheque and restaurant mother: ah

Yogi: UNCLEAR has opened discotheque and restaurants. Called it “Sorba the Greek” 

Yogis laughing

Mother: I only feel one way that, see, by going to these horrible discotheques with a very loud nature the limbic area is affected. And they need louder and louder. And that is the reason they want to go to this Gurus also where the same thing

Yogi: they like cheap

Mother: Mmm

Yogi: They like cheap

Mother: the limbic area being numbed; they won’t understand me very much.

Yogi: they are saying now this drug is back in fashion it’s called it crank

Another yogi: crack?

Yogi: crank. Crank, It’s a mix it’s like street

Mother: it’s a new one

Yogi it’s like street. You can either smoke it or inject it. And it cost 10-50 dollars an ounce. So

Yogi: what is it?

Yogi: in the 60’s it was used. Don’t worry about it. Just praying into this, it’s a new word.

Some people find crack expensive, and they can only inject it and with the crank you can smoke it. They make crank with marijuana, or they inject it.

That man you were speaking to in Washington, Shri Mataji said he locked doped himself

Mother: Ah poor fellow he was saying “we are trying to live our best UNCLEAR 1:02:52 ...and it’s not easy”

All talking and laughing

Mother: I said he must have dopped himself

Yogi: I think he must have got up very early in the morning because it was 4 o’clock or 3 o’clock in the morning in Washington when they were doing the recording in London

Mother: still, doctor

Yogi: how was he such an expert in it. He must have dopped himself.

Mother: he must have experimented it

Mother: Vanikara do you know the secret? Why you think why should you go to Washington? It’s not a shore or anything. You see, it is very much away from CEOs. How? You know what happen when they went to Nicaragua 1:04:00 UNCLEAR they took their plates and while coming back, They dropped all the people, they filled it up with all kind of drugs and brought the entire that  1:04:18 UNCLEAR to Washington. So, the corruption is at that level

Doctor: yes

Mother: So, what can you do?  You see, this goes hand in hand with democracy and it prospers more in countries where they are not traditional. Like in India, we have all this I mean we have all this since long, you know, and it’s worse for people who takes drugs like UNCLEAR 1:04:55 regardless of where,

It’s worse than leprosy and they were kept outside the city, in UNCLEAR 1:05:05 world.

What are we going to learn?I am not going to learn this things. It’s not good, but he must’ve learnt somehow, very few. Because of the wisdom in the whole society. This is not normally goes against your awareness and all that. And I mean UNCLEAR 1:05:55 in India somebody asked me, what would you say on the table for cheers and we don’t have it

All Laughing

But cheers, because we don’t have it on the table. Anybody who drinks must do it privately somewhere

All Laughing

Oh, I’ve never seen anything until I came to London me and my husband. I never seen, even now I don’t know what to call it. But today, they were laughing at me when I said I don’t drink in the plane.

Yogi: in the first class, yes. That’s the most difficult place for them to believe that the person can travel and not drink

Mother: but they were quite relieved, because at least there is one person who is there that they don’t have to look after.

Yogi: for 2 hours after the flight took off, they won’t serve the meals because people want to start drinking. UNCLEAR 1:06:57 person’s name-Aradnus? was getting quite fed up. She said why do they drink so much? UNCLEAR 1:06:57 (don’t they realize we are hungry also

Yogi: I find it difficult, unless I am at home in my routine it’s very difficult. I mean on the airplane it’s difficult too.

Mother: but I don’t eat on the airplane as far as possible. Very little. But today’s food was horrible.

Yogini: they gave me a steak about that thick and about that big. It was gray it’s just looked awful.

Mother: They have frozen things, I think. Food should be better, but they always give bad food. Once I traveled by Canadian airline to India, really bad food. They have learned it I don’t know which way. It is too much frozen food It’s a very bad thing, you see, specially I have seen the seafood if it is frozen is very dangerous it gives you allergies and things like that.

Yogi: of course, Shri Mataji, I forgot. I keep thinking you’ve been here for a few days of course and you just came today

Yogi: yes

Mother: every day

Mother: I don’t think she is all right; I don’t think so. she has been troublesome there also. I don’t know, how do you find her? Asking a yogini

Yogini: troublesome

Mother: she’s very troublesome.

I don’t know.

Yogini: she’s very good after she has been with you after Pooja with Shri Mataji she’s very good for a couple of months and then she doesn’t stay,

she calms down and.

Mother: I saw her this time before coming. I think she was at the airport. I don’t think she’s all right. She should sit with their left hand towards the photograph with the light, but she’s obstinate UNCLEAR 1:12:35

He is alright. He is alright. She was saying here something wrong with him.

Yogini: that’s what you told me, yeah

Mother: no, no no no no, he’s alright. She has something in a funny condition. It is only some sort of a bhadas in her. You see.

Yogini: she wants to be divorced.

Mother: it’s stupid, that’s what she is, she should divorce her bhoots. You tell her. She should put the left hand towards a photograph and a light.

She thinks she’s too clever and intelligent. That’s the trouble with her. So asked her to put her right hand (left hand). All such a people you know, something wrong with them, they are very troublesome and they’re troublesome to everyone, like a lime has shine for everyone in the same way these people shine for everyone. Everyone will give me the same report. We have these, Alexandra, again what is her name?

Yogi: Sandra Castello UNCLEAR:13:54

Mother: ah, when I, she was in Millan, so Javier wanted to get rid of her. UNCLEAR 1:14:05

He said Mother marry her to somebody

I said to whom to marry her I don’t want to kill somebody else

So, then they sent her to somewhere to Rome and Guido got fed up with her then they send her to Frankfurt. She’s very well-educated woman and she’s also very good at certain business-like selling books and things. So, she was in Frankfurt. Now poor UNCLEAR 1:14:37 Herbert?

Mother’s laughing

It’s another very mild person. he is fed up. He got rid of his wife. Now this lady is there... And where to send her?

Yogi: she is a funny lady. Isn’t she?

Another yogi: She is

Mother: is bad, Doctor UNCLEAR 1:14:54

Yogi: the first time I met her was when you UNCLEAR 1:15:03 Ox cart run over her foot. Do you remember?

UNCLEAR 1:15:05 talking in another language

Mother: Ah, she is the same?

Yogi: yes it’s the same

Mother: And I was telling her don’t come near near this car. just get away get away, but she would not listen, you see. That’s a trouble.

Yogi: she wanted to be close

Wheel went over foot I had I had 15 stitches

Mother: I know

Another yogi: every time Shri Mataji sits on the car, she was always telling her, the whole attention is on her.  don’t come near the car stay away. Mind your own foot!

Mother: Then I have to treat her for so many days to put it right. And such a people take time to cure absolutely. Normally it’s very easy to cure people and she was mad really but now at least I thought she could improve actually it should be all treated like possessed people. educated

Everything, very well educated I think she is a PhD. It should be given an MAD

All laughing

Talk in another language

Mother: thank you

Talk in another language

UNCLEAR 16:35

Yogi: We won’t be seeing you before then, because by the time you come to England we would have left

Mother: good

where is the paper he has to read or?

Yogi: I haven’t seen it yet I’m going to Helsinki to present a paper I’ve never seen

Mother: it alright. Leave it to the divine. it all works out

Yogi: I’m very happy to.

Mother: you see you have to know that the divine works out everything, everything works out by the divine. Just leave it to the divine. And sometimes things don’t work out according to our own desire or according to our own plans or maybe according to our own ideas then understand that there is something more than that, and that we have not seen that. Or maybe supposing I get lost on the way then I think I have to go that way, so I am there. I never get frustrated. I have to go that way, so I am there, what is the, what I’m going to gain otherwise I’m there after all that’s all I have to be there. that’s all. So, all this comes because we have certain ideas and that was not working out. What happens what happens, and we always fail in our own ideas so better is to leave it to God. By God‘s grace, I mean you people are well equipped now in Sahajyoga and everything will come. Now you were telling me about Karen. One day karen UNCLEAR came to Pune and he started talking about enzymes and I don’t know but I talk to him only about enzymes, what are the enzymes what do they do do you what happens this that. He said he had to go for an exam, but he was not at all prepared. Do you remember what I have told to him. He didn’t read anything same thing came and he answered, and he got the highest mark.

Yogis laughing

Yogi: top the glass he has an A+ mark

Mother: and they have given him scholarship, but if you ask me today about enzymes, I don’t know what it is.

Yogis: yes

UNCLEAR Yogi: He said that you made them Shri Mataji

Mother: it is like a library doctor. At try UNCLEAR 1:19:26 times it comes out. Even when I listen to my own types. I think I’m reading from my library, like that.

Yogi: Last Fortnite he got attached to a profesor Xcl in strandford who is a leading man in this field in DNA. He is appointed current to do his research so he can use his lab and

Mother: All these have worked that way

Yogi: where is that?

Yogi: San Diego

Yogi: ok

Yogi: you have a pretty fixed schedule to return, I meant

Yogi: i’m lucky if I have some time left. I have to leave on Sunday.

Yogi: he was looking forward to seeing you on Sunday. If you could take the Sunday night flight and get to London on Monday

Yogi: well, I already got my ticket to New York. I think it will be difficult to. Unless of course Shri Mataji wants it too.

Talk in another language

Yogi: you are free on Monday, is it?

Mother: if you can manage. You manage the ticket, ok, no problem.

Because see they like your accent, they like English accent very much

Yogi: even in California Shri Mataji

Mother: California, they like, not in England. in England you must have cockney accent, like aa uu ee if you go on, they don’t like educated people speaking I have seen that. And uneducated people have to speak like them otherwise they don’t like it. it is a very funny situation. Oxford University they said that they get after the students, the villagers, very jealous of the students. So there, I have seen also very educated people speak with cockney accent.

UNCLEAR 1:21:44 Recording stopped and back initially low volume and UNCLEAR

Bless us

This country

They said these Americans are exploiting us

First of all, they said that they have killed most of the Columbian. And native UNCLEAR people and now they combine our wheat UNCLEAR 1:22:00...price. we are suffering a lot and we have a very big problem to produce wheat and even the production price we cannot come up... UNCLEAR..1:22:15 So just bless us with something that we can overpower them and they discovered the E76 so this time when I went to Colombia, I was shocked because it was a shanty town when I first got there, and now it’s all scalator and big buildings. They all travel by first class. You cannot get a ticket from there to Miami in the first class. All travel were 1:22:50...

1:23:00 UNCLEAR camera moving and unclear voice

Also, this violence may there is a tapase 1:23:04 UNCLEAR. Because so many people get killed there. So there must be bhoots there, that’s why people are so violent.

And (person’s name) told you that UNCLEAR 1:23:27...Just for nothing at all so he said keep your glass all up. I said but if they hit the glass will be cracked also and he said yes true, but then you can duck down and save yourself

So, I said why to go by such a... UNCLEAR 1:23:52

He said it can be to anyone

It’s so bad

Yogi: about 3 years ago, Shri Mataji the Colombian mafia offered to pay off the Colombian national debt of 19 billion dollars if the government would give them respect 1:24:22 UNCLEAR

They are so rich

Volume striking noise

The narcotraffic is much more sofisticated than the national ... UNCLEAR 1:24:40 they have latest radiar and latest radio, satellite 

Mother: no, I mean I couldn’t believe that I was in Bogotá. First time I went with CP when you were away UNCLEAR 1:24:52

when I reached there this time, I couldn’t believe that I mean it’s absolutely transformed. It was just part and things there was one palace of course they have, and one hotel was, that’s it. and also, we went to see that place called El Dorado or something UNCLEAR 1:25:22 where they had all the gold discovered and that was all Indian designs so they couldn’t understand.

Something I discovered, we went to a party of these mariners and that the emblem was Condor they call so I said why do you have for this name as emblem?

So, they said that our forefathers told us...old ones

They told us that a God called Vishnu came on a condor

we were shocked to hear

And then again CP ask them and yes yes his name was Vishnu and he came on a condor

so, I think the medicine they’re taking must be taking them to supraconscious and there they must be seeing these things

The supraconscious area you can see all the Goddess and Goddesses

Otherwise, I can’t explain it

And they have got in Peru they have got Shiva this thing, Shivas what do you call it mountain Kalis Mountain this that. Vishnu Mountain

How can they have it in Peru? This was the last word I said that Vishnu came there on the condor.

There were many other things to discover like I asked the lady. What do you call for sugar and she said Shakara and Shakara is the absolute Sanskrit meaning.

Shakara?, yeah Shakara, now it’s like

but they say that this language Sant... UNCLEAR 1:27:36 was actually, is a sister language of Latin and santhu means “made yogi” and so then he came to India and was doing yogi so must have come or the people must have taken it or whatever it was, but that’s what they said that. they are so fortunate how can they be so common?

The Best is English. I mean English language has so many Sanskrit words

I can’t understand!

1:28:12 UNCLEAR .... for example even when you say you say AM and PM and I asked them and they don’t know what it is 

yogi: anti meridiem and post meridiem

Mother: Ah

yogi: anti-meridiem and post-meridiem. It’s the..

Mother: meridian has nothing to do with the time. how can it be? Meredian. Actually, it is like, could be like we call the sun as markanda markandeya and the morning time we call it abhyuditas means when it rises the air and when it is going down, we call it patayas. It’s like Sanskrit. Another one is bachelor pharsa you see we too when there were used to be brahmacharies in the schools and when they were passed one exam called brahmacharia, so bachelor of pharsa you see and then the second one we call it master we used to call it Brahmin in our English and master is....1:29:23 UNCLEAR

Another thing is the Xmas. The x and más. mas is a Sanskrit word meaning math so it is the 10 th month and according to Shalivan, it is our calendar . That is the 10th month of December. the chambara. Ambara is the sky. 10 th month sky but if you see also November is navai, nine.  October but according to the news, where is it? It is not.  octo is eight, isn’t it? in English language, but it is not the 10th month. There are so many words which are, like Perth 1:30:28 UNCLEAR in Sanskrit 

Maybe the pagan, maybe prangana

Mother, talking in another language

Prangana means

Yogi: Enlightened

Mother: enlightened 1:30:30 UNCLEAR

England maybe come from a word anguli maybe. Anguli is the finger, small finger so is the small finger of the whole of Europe. 

Yogi: it is very interesting, isn’t it? Angle land angeland Sanskrit because they have long hands 1:30:58 UNCLEAR Angels Angels

Mother: Angels wouldn’t have long hand/ hair unclear

All laughing

Yogi: only Americans

Yogi: UNCLEAR 1:31:24

 Mother: they don’t have blonde hair.... UNCLEAR

They are so microscopic that you can’t see them actually I don’t think anybody have seen angels. human beings UNCLEAR 1:31:56. But when they get forms, like say Gabriel takes the form, or something, they can take any form. They are not in particularly any form as per se supposing the deity Hanuman form. UNCLEAR is different supposing they take Bhairava’s form or something. Isn’t it?

Depend on the form they take.

UNCLEAR (Garura?) 1:32:35 itself is also a form. All vahana are angels like,

Not all the peacock but an Angel can become a peacock. They can take any form so you can not say they have a particular type of form. But mostly they will have, if they have to have, they will have probably a brownish blackish hair UNCLEAR at 1:33:00. If they have to have. 

Because in animals, you don’t find blonde hairs either

Have you seen any animal with blonde hair?

Unclear

Yogi: body animals

All laughing

Mother: Depends on what colour and whatever they are. I would see, mostly they take forms of animals. 1:33:37 UNCLEAR Mostly. Or like birds with feathers and wing, they can be horses also take the form of the horses, but only human being has blonde hair. Do you think so?

Yogi: some dogs

Mother: some dogs, dogs have and also some also horses but I think when they come in contact with human beings perhaps or the climate. some dogs have but absolutely blonde? I don’t think so.

Yogi: lack of sunlight gives a big mutation

Mother: but to me

Child screaming

Yogi: if the hair is exposed to the sun a lot I think and is dark. 

Yogi: UNCLEAR 1:34:48

Mother: what?

Closer to the sun In whatever realm they are in, the Hindus 1:34:57 UNCLEAR

Mother: they are in every realm. They are not affected by sun or anything. That’s the speciality of them.

All laughing

UNCLEAR 1:35:18

Yogi: The sun/your son is if it was here in the videotape unclear

Mother: by to see what what gave me idea was Stonehenge. When I first went to Stonehenge, the vibrations and it was like the kundalini.  and I start thinking how can this knowledge come here.

But my son in law has told me that about kundalini there are pictures in the south UNCLEAR 1:35:58 south Africa villages in old caves, there are pictures that the kundalini show, and the inner energy show chakra show and the other day somebody was saying in some other country they have got it. Peru, I think.

Yogi: a yuva mentioned about Egypt, Shri Mataji. And Narasimha avatar UNCLEAR 1:38:26

Mother:  see Narasimha avatar was the incarnation of Vishnu as the half lion and half man. half lion and half man because see this hiranyakashipu UNCLEAR 1:36:53 one rakshasa was ruling near Laho. And I think Laho and all these places were connected and also Egypt must have been connected. So, he was the ruler hiranyakashipu was the ruler of that place and Prahlada’s mother

Yogi: they are asking for a political asylum here in Canada protection. The six.

Mother:  They attacked and he scaped. He is alright. He’s very nice God feeling man UNCLEAR 1:46:07

Mother:  I was just telling them about just before freedom was given to us this English separated Pakistan and ourselves that was in 47 just before the Independence Day, we can calling it now 15 of August of 1947. And I was in a.

Talking in another language

Mother: I was studying in Lahu at that time and trouble has started very badly in Lahu, so my father sent me a telegram first then he telephoned You better come down so the day I left for my home, my father was there he was member of the constituent assembly. So, when I left that day only, on the way, there was one fellow that was murdered, I saw it. I mean I didn’t see the actual murder. I saw one fellow slumping down. And this stronger one..... UNCLEAR 1:50:23 the one who quarrel me was Muslim. somehow, I don’t know why he said I will take you by another road, he took me by another road to the station some another country I don’t know. But the next day UNCLEAR 1:50:35 our hostess was not invited by Muslims they cut all their clothes, cursed them, hanged them wiped them. It’s terrible!

Until I got married there and for days together all the trains that came to Delhi came with deportees. Such a massacre!

 British were the big mistake. They should accept that “all right, we are leaving then do what you like” I think would have been better. But they are like just sitting on their heads UNCLEAR 1:51:34. They want to decide for everything. and this is how the deciding just put them into too much trouble. In Bangladesh and all kind of things.

Yogi: Mr. Denaof of Pakistan

Mother: But who was Mr.  Denaof after all? These people should have left. They encouraged them too much.

Yogi: unclear. He died after 6 months but UNCLEAR 1:52:00

Mother: and also, you know after all they were such of a minority. Muslims were such a minority. And they have no business to decide on religious bases. Who are they to decide? first of all live, go and live on somebody’s place for 300 years and then you divide them and then

Mother talking another language

They have done everywhere like this. See, they enjoy it.  UNCLEAR 1:52:40

They only started Hindu Muslim this. We never knew this. Divide and do”That’s their policy. And also cheated us. All the time they cheated us.

I was telling them how the king of Nagpur was cheated. They came to Nagpur and said that we are occupying this “log” to protect you and will always help you if you need help. And all the simplicity to begin with. Then they tried to find out what was the loophole, and the king had a stepmother and a child, so they approached her through one minister, one minister. And promised her that we will cure your son, the king, just send him. this fellow... UNCLEAR 1:53:26 and arrest him so when the king reached there, he was killed, and when this lady went there to find out about her stepson she was killed, and the minister was killed, and the little child was also killed. And they declare that now we are the owners.

We have something like call 1:54:12 UNCLEAR

The one who sings all the Time about the history. They still sing all the songs about the British and the deceivers in every way possible they caught up of the treasurer’s and asked them that they should pass so much money to us, we need so much money, you open the door of the fort for us, and we enter in, and they do all the robbing. They never came.

Horrible they were horrible!

Mother: talking in another language

Mother: next time you must also advertise me in the Indian papers, there are 2 or 3. You can consult him about it.

Mother: he said that you have to give it in English, and they can translate them yogi: Punjabi to English

Mother: they can do it

he will give you the newspaper name they he said they will be very happy to come, Indians. Indians don’t go to false gurus here much because they have no money to pay, 300 pounds.  Do you think Canadians have that much money to pay 300 pounds?

Yogi: yes

Mother: that means 900 for three days

Yogini: isn’t it 300 for the whole experience?

Mother: no, no no. 300 per day.

Talking in another language

Yogi: I have to sleep, because for him is, the whole night just went by being awaken

All laughing

When I arrived here, what was the time?

So, I mean I have to sleep because I have no sleep last night also. So, I just say I am going to sleep
