Talk before puja, "Vishuddhi Chakra". Vienna (Austria), 4 September 1983.

Before going to America, I wanted to speak more about the Vishuddhi chakra and about Shri Krishna's aspect within us. In the first Puja in Geneva, I spoke quite a lot about it, but there is no end to it, of course, because it is the centre of Virata. But one has to realize that the message of Shri Krishna was to surrender. Now the surrendering that we think in the gross way is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy. So when the word "surrender" is spoken, we build up our barriers by thinking that we have to surrender something to the other part. But when Shri Krishna was talking about surrender, He was saying that "surrender your enemies to me so that I will get rid of them".

Now the worst enemy that we have is our ego. And with ego starts all kinds of other problems, because it is the biggest barrier for our growth. And the ego starts as you know from the Vishuddhi chakra, and can be sucked into Vishuddhi chakra.

Now let us see how is Vishuddhi chakra made. All the vowels that we use come from Vishuddhi chakra. And like in Devanagri language it is a ... ang-aha.* So as you know you cannot compile a word without a vowel, it is so important. A consonant is weak, without any strength, without the vowel, So the strength of a person comes through the Vishuddhi chakra in his speach. But it can be absolutely stiff also, the strength could be absolutely stiff. Supposing you have a very strong weapon but you can't lift it, so what is the use of having a weapon like that ? See, this Mr. Ego tries to make the weapon heavy and stiff like jammed machine-guns. Now that is what He has said that "surrender your ego to Me", so that when you say a mantra or utter words, they are effective as weapons, good weapons, effective good weapons, efficient.

Now when we talk, let its see how I see your ego expressed in your talk, so that you will understand how to address Me and to judge yourself. For example shaking your necks too much is a sign of a Mr. Ego shaking head for nothing at all. Like many people have a habit "yes" if it is said, they'll go on like this for ten times. There is no need. Actually, you should move only once, with humility, the head "yes Mother" is all right. You must move your neck with respect and with understanding that Shri Krishna is sitting there. With dignity. But we forget it all the time and we start using it to assert ourselves when we talk to someone. And we shake it too much or we push it in such a way that another person is sort-of dominated by it.

Now there is another method when you talk to Me, like saying "no Mother". It is very common, if I say anything, the first reaction of people could be "no Mother". After all you see there is a course going on, even when I'm speaking it is a mantra, when I'm not speaking, is a mantra flowing. And suddenly you come out with your "no Mother", you create a ripple back in the whole thing. Now at that time, if you just listen to Me what I'm saying, the saying itself will work it out, you don't have to do anything.

Now another way is the style in which you talk to Me, also I can see the right Vishuddhi acting. It is when we talk normally to each other, if we have to say "yes", we'll say "m-m". That is very common here "a-a". this style, they say "hum-um" and then on top of that to say "mm-mm" as if you see it clearly. It is : you are not receiving anything in it, but you are trying to sort of put it to an equal pressure on the flow.

The humility is the best way of conquering this ego of Vishuddhi. And when talking to others, try to develop sweet methods, sweet ways unhurting other people. And you will be surprised that Vishuddhi will immediately start behaving in such a sweet manner, because the bhoots don't like sweetness, they are quarrelsome, they are harsh, they are always trying to say something to hurt.

So this Vishuddhi on the right hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said. Actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart : "I don't want this ego any more. I want Reality." "Let the Reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start doing it from your heart, you will be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that, it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now "wak shakti", means the power of speach.

So when you surrender ego, what you do actually is to say that "I'm not doing anything, it is You who do everything". So that a little drop has now become an ocean. And so your sound has got the power of the ocean.

Now the second thing you have to surrender, is the pride, or vanity. Now the vanity can be of many types which are artificial things absolutely. Before God, what is your property? What is your money? What is your position? What is your family ? What is your education ? You see, everything has no value in the presence of God. The possessions that one value so much have no value. So one has to realize that if we are the possessions of God, we should be proud of one thing only, that His vibrations flow through us. That is : He is proud of us.

Like supposing you give Me a fruit or a Ganesha, or anything, it gets very much valued because I have touched it and the vibrations are there. Like this Ganesha now for example, if you see the value is zero as far as the metal is concerned, but when made into an art-piece has some much more value. In this world, the value increases with art, but in the realm of God, or in the spiritual world or Divine world, the value of a Ganesha, the same Ganesha will be a thousand time more than what it is just now as just an art piece. So that is now what is given to you, a very high value. So the pride and the vanity of artificiality, artificial things, is all man-made, mythical, and should be surrendered because it is a myth.

Then the human mind has another capacity to be jealous, to be jealous of others. This also comes from unwise understanding. If you surrender your jealousies at the Lotus Feet of God, I mean, you are doing all rubbish actually. The stupid jealousies that you have are as you know, of no value, neither in this world, nor in that world. The most surprising thing is that the Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other ! And I still can't understand how can it be ? If you are standing in the sunshine, then you all are jealous of your shadows ! Somebody's shadows are big, somebody's shadows are small, so you are jealous of each other ? Sometimes I give a present to one person, can't give to others, then they get jealous ! If I give more time to somebody, then others are jealous ! I only give more time sometimes to people who really are getting lost I

So one has to understand that all our ideas about jealousies are stupid. And I can't understand those who are not realized, they are jealous of Sahaja Yogis, and they try to make them fall ! Instead of being jealous, they should become like Sahaja Yogis ! In Sahaja Yoga also I've seen some very funny things happening, an incidence. Like a person came to me and was very angry that "Mother You spent so much time with a particular person, and Im very jealous. And You said I have to be like the people about whom I'm jealous so I would like to know how to be like the person who was with you for such a time ?" So I said "That fellow is really a lunatic 1 You want to become a lunatic ? Have you no discretion ?" A Sahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is alright. You should understand that what I'm saying is to be used discreetly, not blindly. So you can understand, without discretion, whatever I say, how funnily you can use it so detrimental to your growth.

So another offshoot of ego is called as ,,hot temper". Of course it is said to be used against people who try to insult your Mother, you have to do that. That must be used for people who go against the Holy Ghost as Christ has said. In the same way you should not tolerate any non-sense against Me from anyone whatsoever, not even this much. But you can tolerate other Sahaja Yogis in other matters.

Another enemy we have is greed, I mean material greed and also human greed, like possessing your wife, possessing your children, possessing this, possessing Mataji also, This also must be surrendered. And this could be very dangerous in Sahaja Yoga also. This is my carpet, this is my camera, this is my tape recorder. Once you start understanding what is mine is not the Truth, nothing is mine, that's the Truth.

Also some people I know of, they say that "my job, or my business, or my enterprise". We had the other day one gentleman in Geneva who was very troublesome because he is so conscious of all these things.

So the greed. Also the Just of other women and indulging Into lust too much. Giving too much importance to the agencies of lust. That creates great problems, not only for Sahaja-Yogis, but on the whole for sahaja Yoga also. it is expressed in both types of people; those who are living in a very free world, as well as people who are over suppressed. I know of people, those, who are supposed to be brought up in very religious ,so called' atmosphere, when exposed to women, suddenly get too much attracted towards them.

See, it is that maturity of your innocence that must be developed, that keeps you a very religious person, dharmic person. And the innocence to know how far to go with men and women. That's the wisdom of innocence. Children, if you see, they know exactly, if there is a lady if there is a man, how to behave. So the innocence is not stupidity. It is a complete wisdom, and very maturesome in its full form. It just knows how to be with people without indulging into anyone of these enemies. Each enemy is sufficient to finish not only one person, but billions and billions. So best way to develop that absolute nature of your Vishuddhi Chakra is to witness the whole thing with a detached mind. And to develop love for your Mother in your heart, so that She cleanses all these enemies, in such a way that when you are faced with them, you are a powerful person,

Mentally, I think that most of the SahajaYogis understand that obedience to the Divinity is the only way-mentally, rationally. Now even if you understand something mentally, it's not your innate nature. So what I told you yesterday, when you accept something mentally and you cannot do it, you feel guilty about it. Then you become your own guru and punish yourself, and try to make this as your innate nature. It's a state, it clicks. Once it clicks you can see immediately. I know who is surrendered.

So Shri Krishna has said that: "Sarva dharmanam...". He has said that "Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to Me, surrender to my dharma only". So the dharmas we have in our country as we say is a "pitra dharma", what you owe to your father, "matru dharma" what you owe to your mother, then what you owe to your husband, like that, you see, that relationship in which you owe to them. But when He says" surrender all these dharmas", He is meaning to say "you should only know what you owe to Me" meaning the Divinity. Now Shri Krishna is not there, it's Me who is Shri Krishna, so you must know what you owe to Me. I only changed My language. He used to take out His finger and to say that "give up everything and surrender everything to Me". I don't do that way, I give a big lecture and bring you to a point.

So, that should not divert your attention from the right goal that you have to achieve by surrendering. And it is going to work out very well with you people here, I'm sure, and one day I'll find the whole Germans surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
