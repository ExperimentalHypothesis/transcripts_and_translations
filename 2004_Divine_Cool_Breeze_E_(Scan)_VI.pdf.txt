It was a beautiful hotel, the Marriot There were approximately - Love. Once we have achieved those three 600-650 Yogis, mostly from USA and Canada things, we will lead a life as a Sahaja Yogi and but some from as far away as Switzerland, we evolve: SHRI MATAJI also stated that France and a few other countries. SHRI problems are presented our way because MATAJI did not come to the entertainment without problems we would not be able to programs on Friday and Saturday nights. We had beautiful music from all over the States grow and change. We must face our problems and overcome them so that we can rise above and Canada and all quite diverse. There was them and that is how we can grow deeper as also a short comedy from Canada. Saturday human beings. There were many other things morning a beautiful power point presentation from Columbia addressed the meaning of one presented in this power point but this is what I remember as being the most important. of the names of OUR DIVINE MOTHER Hopefully we will be able to buy the CD later "NIRMALA." The presentation was very on. powerful and it will be sold as CD at one of After that presentation, Dr. David Spiro, a medical doctor from England, spoke of the World Council that was formed recently the coming pujas, either Ganesha or Diwali. The presentation was a wonderful 45 minutes of music and beautiful images of SHRI MATAJI as it explained the meaning of by SHRI MATAJI. This council which is represented by 40 leaders from various countries, will have the responsibility of spreading SAHAJA YOGA all over the world. "Nirmala." NIR means "nought or not. MOTHER states that SHE is "nothing." and so we should think of ourselves as nothing. When we think of ourselves in this He also stated that SHRI MATAJI has donated the house in Cabella and the hangar where the pujas are held to VND. In this manner and also ask for nothing we become more and more our spirit. We should not put council there are yogis who will also be in our attention on ourselves but on our spirit.

I felt as if THE HOLY MOTHER was revealing more and more of HER great powers and revealing all that was negative within us and all the negativity on the outside of us. I felt as if THE HOLY Rakhi brother to establish the pure relationship between the brother and sister. In Sahaja Yoga this is the purest of all relationships, it is held during the Krishna Puja celebration because Shri Krishna had a great sister in Vishnumaya. who is the deity in the left Vishuddhi. He, of course, is the Deity of the center Vishuddhi MOTHER was revealing more and more of HER great powers and revealing more and more some of HER DIVINE NATURE. This of course is felt in meditation and each of us experience this DIVINE NATURE of SHRI and in the right Vishuddhi He becomes the King Once the Rakhi is tied, (the thread that the sister ties on the left wrist of the chosen brother), they become brother and sister for the rest of their lives and one promises to help the other if they should need help. or protection. MATAJI in our own personal ways. But this time SHE was revealing to us collectively this Later in the evening we prepared in DIVINE NATURE as we did the Puja to Her in the form of Shri Krishna. It was very joyous anticipation for the arrival of the HOLY MOTHER It was a momemtous occasion. powerful, intense, and certainly all the yogis could feel some many strong vibrations. I was The vibrations were one of the most powerful I have ever felt. When MOTHER arrived a in awe of this great, auspicioLus event! red curtain was opened so that OUR MOTHER could have privacy as SHE was After the Puja each country offered gifis to SHRI MATAJI. I was pnvileged enoug. to be near SHRI MATAJI as Vasu, the coordinator of New York/New Jersey tried to find the vases that were bought from the placed from the wheelchair to the throne, which was a beautifully decorated chain in blue and gold. SHRI MATAJI did not speak at this Puja. SHE did not need to speak. We all felt the LOVE and Power and most of all, the regional areas of USA, We could not find Protection, that was emanating from HER them and only just a few minutes before SHRI MATAJI was supposed to leave he was able presence. A puja to Ganesha was first held as the children offered flowers at HER Lotus Feet. to locate them By then it was too late to offer Then the Puja was held to SHRI KRISHNA. the gifts so Vasu left them on the corner of the HER face was very powerful and as far as my stage as I helped him in this endeavour. It was

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 The Divine Cool Breeze then that SHRI MATAJI was leaving and I was fortunate enough to be so close so HER physically as SHE was wheeled down the ramp in the wheelchair by Manoj. It was at this point that I was privileged enough to bow to SHRI MATAL SHE looked at me, I felt as if THE GREATEST OF ALL MOTHERS communicating to me through HER vibrations which were Divine! As SHE looked at me, SHE no longer was human but DIVINE! Then SHRI MATAJI left. We were all speechless and in awe at what had just ocurred! It was truly an experience of such great power! All the pujas are becoming more was talking to me and stating. This is Ã  great and more powerful and the Vibrations are illusion! I am not this body but I am EVERYTHING in this life! My nature is of Divine level. You can know all of this NOW becoming so incredibly strong. Who could have known that achieving our realization in this lifetime we would be able to reach this if you desire!" The beautiful thing about this is that MOTHER does not have to say anything But it is our Kundalini's connections to HER that allows us to understand instantly what the Divine would like for us mere human beings to understand!! As SHE looked at me, I felt level of being so close to THE GODDESS and all HER LOVE. Who could have known that Sahaja Yoga and THE ADI SHAKTI would allow us to grow to such a high level and experience so many beautiful things! How lucky and fortunate we are to be Sahaja Yogis! vibrationally this Great Woman and Great Love to all and Jai Shri Maaji, Incarnation of the Mother Mary Herself Anna Mancini - New York.

 A LETTER OF SHRI MATAJI (Translation of a Marathi Letter of Shri Mataji) LONDON 11th July, 1980 To, Sahaja Yogis, Received your cable on the eve of Gura Purnima. The sentiments, which you have expressed in very beautiful words have gone to heart.. On the occasion of Guru Purnima day celebrations in London, I explained what is self realisation and whether you have got it or not. I will send the tape recording of this speech with some one instead of sending it by post. suggested, in my earlier letters, to think of "Atma tattwa". Because you are "Atma Swaroop", your mind, intellect and ego, should be enlightened by the "atma-jyoti". The light of wisdom shines in the intellect only when Atma-jyoti illumines in its fullness. Then, mind emits fragrance of love and ego does great and noble works, the whole of your inner being is fully enlightened. You should be able to rely on the Atma tattwa, accommodate others in it, but first stabilize it. Many of the Sahaja Yogis have cured a number of diseases. They have immense love for me and others These people could do all this because they have become experts owing to their "Poorva-Sampada". However, there are many intellectuals among us who have not been able to go very far on the strength of their knowledge or wisdom. Sahaja Yoga is lacking in books We will have to write books in each language. Also, Sahaja Yogis should go to differenent cities and give lectures. Many people send their poems to me. We should collect all these. Similarly my letters can also be printed. Such publicity is necessary. Let it be known all over the world that Sahaja Yoga is the only way to save the world in Kaliyuga. I am writing a book but it is not useful to all at present. All should think on what I have suggested. Every centre may also be accordingly advised. Many blessings from Mother to all Sahaja Yogis. Always remembering you Your mother NIRMALA (Maha Avtar 1980)

Who is the remover of all sins, O' Devi Mahalakshmi, obeisance to Thee) principle, its perfect. It is born as perfect, will remain as perfect, will be always eternally perfect so that it is not necessary to be corrected Now this Mahalakshmi thing I am discussing here because you may be able to go today to see the temple of Mahalakshmi. Now the temple of Mahalakshmi when you go there, you have to know that this deity has come out of the Mother Earth, in this particular place. That means this place has got a capacity Today again is a new year's day. Every new year comes, because we have to take to something that is new. It has been so arranged that the sun has to move for 365 days and again a new year has come. Actually the whole solar-system is moving in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a higher, higher state of this solar system, Every year it is rising higher in a spiral way So it is not only that-it is because 365 days have passed-because it has moved a step forward higher than what it was. Now we can see that in awareness, human beings have definitely risen much higher than what they were, say, about 2000 years back. But, the first system that started the whole universe to give you a force. You can say, an additional force or an intensive feeling of evolution. If you are sensitive enough you can see that, you can feel it and you can do it. If you are not so sensitive you are still so conditioned and still outside, that may not work out. I mean all kinds of things can be done, but if was the first model, you can say was created. And that model has to be perfect. And that was a perfect model which then started t somebody wants to remain a stone you cannot perfecting the rest of it. So that is the perfect model which is in the principle of this ascent. And that is working out this ascent. Now, the perfection of the rest of the universe takes do anything about it So this Mahalakshmi principle is working out in this place Kolhapur. Normally, this place should be very very warm because of its place in various directions. position. But even in summer this place keeps very cool because of the vibrations, from the temple that is emitted. The people in this place But today we have to consider the Mahalakshmi Principle. Now Mahalakshmi, as I told you, is a perfect principle. It's a perfect may not be so aware either We cannot say if

 Issue: 11 & 12 2004 The Divine Cool Breeze positivity. But how I know that, I cannot tel you because I just don't know how to tell you they are aware. Because as negativity has to come forward, there are lots of sugar factories and lots of alcoholism going on here. that. But I just know that such a person is definitely positive and such person is negative. But we have to take the best advantage of every place which is created specially for a particular purpose. So, it is a pilgrimage in a a. The positivity lies in understanding why are way that we are here. That we have to look we here? First of all, why are we on this earth? Why are we human beings? In understanding what are we doing about it? Why are we Sahaja Yogis? What a Sahaja Yogi has to do? What is his responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi? Then he moves forward to understand why Mother is so kind to me? Why have I got after our Mahalakshmi Principle of our ascent. As you know, this ascent starts at the Nabhi and is surrounded by the Guru- principle. Now the Guru Principle within us, if it is upset, if it is juxtapositioned, placed in juxtaposition where if it is not properly embedded within us to the nerves, if it is not vibrations? Why am I among very few who have got this special blessing, the special knowledge of vibratory awareness? And then to ask yourself what am I doing about it? Am I still very much emedded in my cheapishness or in my childishness, in my stupidity, in my harshness, in my aggressiveness? We always see these things in other people, not in ourselves! So we are not Sahaja Yogis. We should understand at that point, when we start emitting through our character and behaviour, Mahalakshmi tattwa cannot be established. Mahalakshmi tattwa is strengthened through Guru principle. Now we are lucky today because there was the birthday of Dutta, the Duttatreya just the other day when we had the Pooja, and today is this Mahalakshmi puja. So two things together we have got together. seeing these things in other people, then we are not Sahaja Yogis. We should see in ourselves and emit pure compassion to others. First was the Dutt puja and today is this puja of Mahalakshmi. So, to have the Guru principle all right, we But always people see that, it is in anotl.. person this exists. Whatever must make our Dharmas correct. Now these Dharmas, as I have told you many times, are I may try to say 1 they always see in other person. ten, and we should look after these ten Dharmas in a very careful manner. These are expressed outside, but whatever is inside comes out. Now I find when you people talk, and you say things, I know that this person is negative, that person is definitely positive. Now supposing there is a negative person amongst us. You need not be compassionate to that person On the contrary better be away. Get rid of that person, as far as possible, don't have anything to do. It is a definite sign of great compassion to yourself, if not to others. There are so many ways of expression of

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 The Divine Cool Brecze 9. Better not have anything to do with the person who is negative, if you have to come up. He understanding in brain' is important. Because may be your brother, sister, anyone. But try to Mahalakshmi tattwa ultimately works in the be away from a person who is not positive. It brain, is the enlightenment of the brain. It is causes lots of problems. I have been telling done by Mahalakshmi tattwa It gives you the you this and I have been requesting you, but conditioning is such that still though you have become a Guru, you don't understand that you have to be detached. For a Guru there is no brother, sister or any other relationship. things. I have to ascend. This is why I am Except for the relationship of the Mother, there here? What am I supposed to do?" Now is no other relationship. One of these principles logically you convince your brain, first of that are to be understood, very important I all. It is very important now after feel, is for all of you "That our relationship is realisation, because if logically your brain of all, try to clarify your ideas and your So in the brain you must clarify. Reach logically; Logically we must reach the conclusion 1 don't have to do these things, I have to do these only to Mother and to Sahaja Yogis and not to any relationship which has come to us, whether through a Sahaja Yogi or whether does not understand, it will always be cheapish, childish, indignified or could be harsh, horribly oppressive. It could be one through anything else". Now this I have been explaining because our Mahalakshmi tattwa is not all right. That is why we get sort of fritter of these. So, in Guru tattwa, there are ten elements. Five of them deal with the weight. "Weight". away, lost into these things. Guru is the Weight, Weight, Weight of a person. How much weight you have got? The gravity, as we call it. Person has a gravity. When he talks how much balance he has got And the Mahalakshmi tattwa has to be like an ascending force, all put together. Like my father used to give an example, that supposing you have collected lots of wheat and you spread it on the ground, it will be all lost. It will be spread out like this side, that side, it will be all lost. But if you put it in a bag, it will rise in height, naturally. It will have those maryadas; wuiren It will rise and it will go higher and higher. In the same way this principle of Mahalakshmi can spread just across like that and can just destroy all that Mother has given us and all that we have had all these IkS See in Indian Music, we call it q, (Vazan) means the weight The weight of the person, means when he is dealing with himself or with others, how much weight he carried. In English also they use this-weight. How much weight he carries with others? Means, how much he can really impress others? If you impress too much then the person will say, "Oh! it is too much'. That is a very big quality with western people, is, "Oh! that is to0 years, only by spreading it out. Now to collect it inside, is to pay attention to yourself. First much!" "They have an idea, you see this is all

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 The Divine Cool Breeze 10 ego oriented. That is too much. If you tell And the another point is how much them too much, Oh! that is too much. She is magnetism you have? So you reverse back to yourself. The magnetism is a magic, is to magic of a person. A person is magnetic because he has certain magic. Now this magic comes from your own personality, from your own personality. So the basis of magnetism on the left hand side starts and that basis is Shri too much. I move slowly, slowly". 'It is toe much for me'. It is very common. It is very common reaction So how much weight you have? And the second one is the quality of magnetism. Two things-weight & magnetism. First is the quality of weight; that's how much dignified you are? How you talk? How your language is? How your behaviour is? You should be humane, But sometimes, even with Ganesha Shri Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism. So your innocence; innocence is the best way to have that magnetism. Magnetism you cannot explain in material way It is not a material stuff But it is something abstract, comes from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha. Such a person is magnetic. Magnetic means such a person attracts other person because of the weight of the person, because of the quality of the person. Such a person attracts, but does not attract for lust, greed and non-sensical things. But attracts another person because of the fragrance of love in the subjects. Now it is always confused, confused because it is such an abstract thing So one must understand it in a very subtle way. What is the magnetism-that one should understand. You see, there are some gestures people use artificially which normally they have been using just to attract other people, the way they walk, the way they dress, the way they live, All these things are of no use. It is something so inner, that fragrance is so inner which must be developed. But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people just do not bother about it. Just do not bother. They think the way they have been living, the way they have been doing this-say if they are English, they are English, if me, I find, people talk in a very funny manner, just don't understand, how it is that always they say the wrong thing. I mean, whenever they have to say one sentence, they will say a wrong thing. It is absolutely with them. It is also Vishuddhi, which is also Nabhi, Comes from Nabhi because you must know that Vishuddhi Chakra is the ascent of the Nabhi Chakra. So what happens is that the person, whatever he is, is expressed through his language, through his behaviour, through his face, through his nose, his eyes, everything, through the Vishuddhi Chakra. So the ascent of the Nabhi is expressed, shown through the Vishuddhi Chakra. Now whatever you have in the Nabhi, is shown here. Supposing, now a person who has the Mahalakshmi tattwa properly developed, such a person will have a way of dealing with another person when he will have the weight, as well as the understanding, how far to go with the person? How far to carry on with that person? How far to talk to a person? How far to think about it? How much importance to be given? That is one point, is very important.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Issue: Il & 12 - 2004 II your wife, not to your husband, not to your sister, not to your country, not to anyone but to Mother 'Complete dedication' gives you that charisma, or that attraction. In Sahaja Yoga such a person becomes really attractive and such a person has it. they are French they are French, if they are Indians they are Indians, if they are from Kolhapur they will be from Kolhapur. These ideas first must be curbed off. Because the fragrance spreads everywhere whether you are English or any one. So the fragrance of a person develops through, first of all, the Ganesha Principle within. Ganesha Principle is Now some people think that if you are a very passive person and if anybody says anything to you and you don't mind, sort of a person, to be first of all seen to. Now a Ganesha person is not a person who is absolutely a you are charismatic. It is not. People like you remorse type or a person who is such a gone because they can dominate you. They like you case that even if you beat him up and make him into a complete minsed thing, he will bear it. It's not like that, it's not that. On the contrary, because they can dominate you. Not if you think that by your aggressiveness and by your shouting and by your screaming at these the quality of magnetism is such that it attracts people, you will achieve that charismatic you to a point where 'you' are not disturbed. Now this is a very important point we should know. You see, if you have other loves, love like carnal love and all other love you have, temperament, you cannot. You cannot achieve that height. So how do you achieve it? By becoming more innocent. Now how innocence develops in a person is then that love may attract the person, then that person can destroy you and it destroys you, always. But this attraction does not destroy, does not destroy. The attraction is upto that point that you are not destroyed, because you being much higher, much deeper and much weightier, you cannot be destroyed by a thing that whom you are attracting. Always the greater magnet attracts the smaller magnet. And that is what one should understand. This magic and this charisma, charismatic temperament of a person, comes by, first of all, the Ganesh tattwa, innocence. And secondly by complete dedication and devotion. Those who are completely by not thinking about it. Like you see somebody asked me, 'how do you manage your Income Tax?" I said, "By having no income at all'. Then they asked me, 'How do you solve your car problem?' By not having any car at all of mine. They said, 'What about your house problem?" By having no house of my own. "Nihi, Nihi." Everything Nihi for me. Then how do you Sir solve your this problem, By not having it, just have no, not have it, Don't take up headaches upon yourself See when you take up headaches upon yourself, then only the innocence is reduced. That headaches like this, that this is my shawl, this ' is my sari, this is my thing, this is this, this is this, this is this. But only one thing is that dedicated and devoted to Mother. Not to *anything' else. Ganesh tattwa again. Not to

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 12 The Divine Cool Breeze "simple' innocence and it all works out very well, It is so clean It just says what it knows and what it knows is the highest *this is my Mother and I have to proclaim Her', that is all. If that is the way it is, then innocence starts rising like Shri Ganesha and by having no other headache. So this de-conditioning has to be brought This is 'mine', that is mine This 'mine' within us. But you should not discuss it among business causes the problem, I think. Personally I think this must be the reason. That this 'mine' business. Because whatever is mine, somebody told me- this is very good argument she gave-Whatever is mine is not I, means that is yourself also. Once you start discussing then you also-it becomes sort of a theological "This is mine." argumentation There is no theology about it It is very simple. It is the simplest thing-'is to be innocent'. But the innocence is lost, why? 15 Because our attention is in different way, we not Sahaja. My body, my head, my everything-'my'. But 'I'? -she gave me this idea-- T. What is T? Then 'I' is separated, Whatever is not mine is T'. So what remains is your Spirit. Somebody gave me this argument. I said this is good argument to are attentive to other things. We are looking at other things. It is so simple, you know. Today I was thinking I have to buy three nine yard saris. A simple question as it is, because there were three ladies who wear nine yard saris and I had to give them three nine yard saris. That is all. I Just thought of it. All nght. work it out Then whatever remains is the 'T and that I' is the one we have to see to. So I came here, I saw very nice saris being put here. So I asked her. Where do you get these?" She said "You get it here'. I said All right'. So you go and buy these three saris, no analysis, nothing of the kind. It just came into my mind that I have to buy three saris, finished. The answer is here So even the atmosphere is so innocent, the whole situation is so innocent that the solution is presented u you go on reducing all these mines, mines, mines- So the pure spirit of innocence will rise. So the idea about Spirit also people think that if you become spiritual, I mean, I don't know what people think about spiritual people Why the idea about spiritual people is that they have to be sharp like a fox or you have to be intellectual like Freud or something All sorts of ideas people havel No, it is not! Spiritual person is just innocent, just' innocent. There is no intelligence, nothing Just innocence. The whole thing is innocence. So whatever he talks or says comes through innocence It does not have intellect as such, which here people have it through reading and through understanding and by analysing Nothing of the kind. It just has 'pure' and innocence to innocent. Innocence works out in everything, you see because every body has little bit of innocence in them, isn't it? So you can-it is like a fifth column you see The innocence is a fifth column within you. So if any person is innocent, you see he will work on your fifth column and will make you all right. When you give bandhan (2a) to others, what happens? You actually bind him by your

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 13 The Divine Cool Breeze innocence and the poor fellow does not know: He has his innocence within him, you capture that innocence, that is all you have done, that's coming to you, automatically. Just don't project your minds into it. Just you wil get answers to every question just like that. Because innocence in anyone is the how you manage It is very simple to work out thing. Only principle, the tattwa, the whole thing rests on what - 'tattwa'-is simple answer where all the complications drop out innocently. nothing but innocence. And that is what is the love of God, is the love of God. So don't confuse this with love, So try to develop this by all these things fd a (Neti, Neti)-saying not this, not this. Not with all your non-sensical love, ideas you have about people and identification, misidentification This is pure love within us, this, not this 'to all your faults.* Not this, not this, not this, not this',-you reach there, 'Not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine'-you reach there. And that is how it is, and you see the the purity, the innocence is love and which is life itself, we should say, is a part of that, the prized. But pranashakti is not Mahalakshmi, so Mahalakshmi is the *essence' and whole material world is not attacking the innocence, because they are frightened. You essence" of everything. Because if creation has to take place, also, if desire of God is cannot attack. Innocence cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed. Innocence is there and if there is no Mahalakshmi tattwa, then what is the use of having desire,-is something, is all pervading and it cannot be destroyed. So whatever people may try, it cannot be destroyed. But it can be covered, it can recede, but it cannot be destroyed, it will act it's own way So try to develop that finished. Supposing even if you have creation and you don't have Mahalashmi tattwa, how you work it out? You cannot work it out, will you You have to have Mahalakshmi tattwa. innocence which is the basis of Mahalakshmi Because they don't have any meaning. tattwa, we should say, 'or that is essence of Mahalakshmi tattwa". So the outward things, the weightage, the weight, the dignity, the behaviour, everything. It is outward thing and the inside thing. The tattwa, the principle, on So outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattwa, but inside, inside is, we can say, there are three cores. The first core is Mahalakshmi tattwa outside to look at, you see the growth alright. which it is based, is innocence. But inside is the creation, that is all the elements being created and all that. But inside that is the desire and inside the desire is the half-one, Now if it is this, if we understand Mahalakshmi tattwa within us, how it has to work out? It is you can say, is Ganesha. So this Ganesh tattwa definitely overpowers everything and permeates through everything And this is, I would say, that don't think about it. Just allow not intellectual. Again I would say that, I don't want you to project your intellect into it, and to find out. But just remain where you are and you will find the answers just

That is very important, to have your dignity Like some people think if they wear tall clothes and walk about on the street, and all will think that they are big sanyasis. It is wrong Why? You are not being dignified and God has given you so much! Why should you try to show that you have not got anything? Just to show that you have not got anything? Just to show off that you have not got anything God has given. This is just a sort of thanks giving to God you have given me so much, you have to wear the best. Like in Puja if you see the ladies here wear all their noserings and all their ornaments and everything, in the temple, everything they wear. And in same way, men also wear their very clean dresses, very clean things, whatever they have. They wear simple clean dresses, whatever they have. But no showing off, it is just a thing by which you express, the God has given you this. *O God! L thank you'. Kolhasura was killed, where this was established. So Mahalakshmi incarnation came in and that is how this place has a special value, that we have come here for a pilgrimage and let us, in a humble way, think about it. Actually these things could not take place in the West. Because even if they had come out of the Mother Earth who would have recognised them? Who would have known about them? Who should have respected them? Who would have worshipped them? That is why it did not happen in the West too much. But it is there, little bit is there, no doubt. But here now we have these, all these temples and the attack on the innocence has come from the tantrikas. And so the tantrikas rented out this temple and they tried to establish themselves. And gradually they are being neutralised and cleaned out. These tantrikas have gone into every temple of all the Goddesses, and they will be gradually all out, straight out. So this is the attack that came through and that how these brahmins came down and settled in these places-so called It is such a great day today to be the new year, on the new year day to be here on brahmins-and tried to preach about all tantrik method and things here in the temple and they Mahalakshmi's place of Kolhapur.

 APHORISMS OF PATANJALI Vs SAHAJA YOGA Patanjali's aphorisms on Yoga, knowni as Patanjali Yoga. Sutras is one of the outstanding works on Yoga and has been acciaimed as an authority on Yoga since time immemorial. According to some scholars these were (b) Knowledge by inference (Anumana); (c) Knowledge gained from teachings of great people whose minds are free from temptation, jealousy, hatred, illusion etc. and who are interested in the welfare of others. (Aptavakyam). This vrittis is "Agam' compiled to counter evil effects of Buddhism which was then degenerated and which also had the patronage of rulers. The aphorisms are divided into four parts or chapters known as Samadhi's Pad, Sadhana Pad, Vibhuti Pad, 2. Mistaking one thing for another (Viparyaya). and Kaivalya Pad. 3. Delusion (Vikalpa) Knowledge conveyed only in words without having anything corresponding in existence. In the second aphorism of Samadhi Pad, Yoga has been defined as restraining the activities or thought waves of mind (Chittavritti nirodha). Mind is made of Satva Guna, Rajo 4. Sleep. It is that vritti, in which absence of all vrittis is experienced. Tamo Guna Guna and Tamo Guna and activities of the completely dominates the mind and makes it and other sense organs inactive: mind correspond to domination of one or more of these Gunas. When mind becomes This experience itself is a vritti and is called sleep (Nidra) thoughtless due to restraining of vrittis, the self (atma) rests in his own state and at other times 5. Memory. Any experience leaves behind its impressions in mind which remain dormant till similar circumstances he is identified with vrittis. Vrittis are classified as under :- 1. Right Knowledge (Pramana) reactivate them. These vrittis are This is further classified as memories (a) Knowledge from direct perception The activities of the mind can be stopped by constant practice of prolonging the gap (Pratyaksha);

It individual consciousness. "I' consciousness is must be noted here that Patanjali does not removed in Asampradnyat Samadhi, although even mention the Yogic Postures (Yogasans) certain impressions of previous Karmas and which are mastered by the people after long experiences exist.

While discussing Ashtanga Yoga, he had word of God is Pranava and by repetition of again emphasised devotion to God this word and thinking on its meaning introspective power is increased and physical and mental obstructions are removed discnmination between real and unreal and firm conviction in mind about Purusha, the spirit affected by any vritti. Further step suggested much importance to breath-control (Pranayam) Last three stages of Ashtanga Yoga viz., Dharana, Dhyan and Samadhi which are related to inner development have been Asampradnyat Samadhi is of two types. Sabeeja, and Nirbeeja ie., with or without attachment to wordly objects, which exists in very subtle form, (seeds). Subtle impressions called Samaskars if not destroyed get awakened at an opportune time and make discussed in Vibhuti Pad. These three are to be practised with reference to one object (Desh-some scholars call it Chakra). Dharna is holding the mind on to some object. Unbroken flow of knowledge from that object is Dhyan and when the form of the object is given up and only the unexpressed meaning is Ã¶ne do good or bad deeds. Also realization of the self is not possible unless these are reflected, the state is Samadhi. When all the three are practised together, it is called Samyam. Even this practice does not lead to seedless (Nirbeeja) Asampradnyat Samadhi, destroyed. These are removed in Nirbeeja (seedless) Asampradnyat Samadhi. Samadhis explained in Samadhi Pad are

Unless oscillations of mind from one state to another are stopped, performing Yoga Asanas and Pranayam, for any length of time will not lead to thoughtlessness Perhaps they must have been very useful in ancient times in the circumstances then prevailing, In modern times only Yoga Asana and Pranayam are given maximum they have little relevance in modern times: According to aphorisms they are to be discarded as obstructions in the progress. Samayam on discrimination between Chitta and Purusha (the spirit) has been suggested for realization of the self importance and preparatory stages like extemal and internal purity, devotion to God, study of scriptures are completely ignored. However, unless subtle desires are completely destroyed realization of the self is not possible. It is stated in Kaivalya Pad that only those desires will manifest themselves for Patanjali's Yoga has goodness of its own but from his methods it may be easily concluded that it is not only difficult to practice, to achieve the goal of Nirvana in this modern time, but also it is not at all possible for the ordinary person with family life toiling for even which environment are most suitable. Other remain stored up till proper environments are available. Subtle desires are held together by cause and effect, in that they are the causes of good or bad deeds and the deeds in turn create further desires by leaving behind subtle impressions of the experiences. These are stored in mind Response to external matters also creates further new desires. Desires obstruct discrimination between real and unreal, the existence of his own and hence comes the importance of Sahaja Yoga with its sim imple devices but with complete surrender to achieve the fulfilment of life and to arouse the virtues already existing in us by the kind grace of our Divine Mother H.H.

The thoughtless, blissful awareness, which the Divine Mother grants to Sahaja Yogis, in short time, would more or less correspond to, depending upon individual physical, mental conditions, a stage of Asampradnyat Samadhi with attachment to wordly matters. thoughtless stage by following various methods suggested in Sadhana Pad.

 Love and Marriage five of the hardest years in this life. This was Before Sahaja Yoga, everything has an element of danger in it because we do not know what is really happening in any situation or how we really feel. Love and marriage is a due not to the difficulty of any of the things that Sahaja Yoga involves but to my own ignorance, stubbornness, insensitivity and laziness-fine qualities for a saint! I actually hindered my own progress. dicey game with very unpredictable outcomes. With the advent of our Mother's grace into our lives with the gift of our own Self-realisation it is possible for all life's previous uncertainties to be washed away and the confusions replaced by the clear view of absolute values. But anether danger can arise once we have In the West the problems are different from those facing Eastern seekers, but in many things we all share the same difficulties but perhaps disguised in slightly different ways. One of these is the question of love and marriage, it is a rich ground for negativity to attack-after come to Sahaja Yoga if we do not realise that Self-realization does not mean instant perfection all the family forms the base for our lives. For (for majority of seekers). Our judgements do not become infallible overnight, they have to grow in wisdom, just as in any newborn child myself the problems lay in the forming of my own very unrealistic ideas as to how marriage would come to me and what it would entail we have to imbibe knowledge with understanding, it cannot be blindly memorised. The Ego and Supergo battled with each other producing visions of either a cold, reliable My own experience in five years of Sahaja Yoga has been a series of revelations begining with the indeseribable feeling that the first meeting with our Mother awakens within us. The realisation that there is truth and beauty, and above all, Divinity more beautiful and real partner or a romantic besotted one. The outcome of such extremes was the same, a strong desire to avoid marriage and just dedicate myself to Mother and forget such human desires. My most recent revelations in Sahaja Yoga have come with my marriage in the presence of our most Compassionate and Understanding Mother when I felt the joy of surrender and trust in Her protection and I wept with that joy as I realised that being a than even our wildest dreams beheld. From this point my life was really changed-every part of it was transformed by this first realisation. However, this did not mean that I became a saintly and wise persons from that loving wife to my new husband was all part of the play moment, no, in some ways these have been

 Reality of Life Umpteen religious and other theories of reaching God exist in the world today. Every individual has his notions about God Almighty. As such, one's belief and faith depend to a comprehension. This is so because they have discovered certain sources of energy which they have been able to use to their ends, thus controlling them. An energy which controls them is not acceptable. However more than anything else they just befool themselves. Don't they know that it is Life Energy by which they live, yet they have no idea where it comes large extent upon one's personal opinion of the Lord. There are so many other things which give him newer ideas about God; namely books, people and the countless Gurus who circulate these days. In the end a person ends up having a cock-eyed idea of the Lord or he stops believing in God. Psychologists come up with statements like believe in God because of fear, conditioning and a whole string of other reasons. What they fail to see is that God is not anybody's opinion, nor is He a fictional character who exists because people believe in Him due to some reason but that He is the sole reality. Everything owes its existence to Him. A new idea which has now entered the heads of people and is rather frequently stated very dramatically is that - "We do not believe in God, but in a supernatural power". What they cannot understand and see is that there is no difference since this supernatural power is none other than the Power of God, the Divine from and where it goes. Too many foolish ideas exist, eg. Life is for living and that is it' But what about knowing your own meaning? This is something which few people bother about. Everyone must know what the next person is doing, try to give some deep sounding logic to nonsense, try to find meaning in cheating, lying, idiotic behaviour, indicency but completely ignore oneself From the World's point of view this state may sardonically be 15 said to be "selfless' for our is perpetually bothered about others.

This could be one of those times. to matter except one's self which is all Therefore, instead of negating the possibility and building up a resistance why not come and see and find out yourself what it is all about. Then another question which follows is Who is Mataji? To this the answer is as important and is the only way of knowing God. But, then again when one is used to dirt it is quite useless speaking to him of cleanliness. In the same way a person used to erying and depression fits cannot understand what joy and happiness are. Most of all, the man of today is used to thinking 24 hours a day and cannot Mataji replies- "First find out your own meaning and know yourself, then you shall understand a state of thoughtlessness but total know Me." awareness where, there is, truth, peace, calmness and joy. Truth and joy go together It is not possible to say anything of someone so Great, infinite as Mataji. It is just sufficient For too long have people looked upto others, to know that She is our Mother who loves us who know as being too Great for them to so fully and completely that we cannot actually fathom how much. We may falter question of know, but now the time has come for them to know themselves realise, their Greatness, know doubt, but our Mother loves us eternally. the Truth and their own joy. How can all this Therefore, as good children, it is our duty also to be what our Mother expects of us. And happen? Well, the answer is simple- Sahaja Yoga. what She expects of us is to be jewels, shining This can happen now because our Divine Mother Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi is here to with purity, love, humility, joy and greatness in the knowledge of ourselves and Her glory. A child loves his mother, just because she is his make it happen and she has said that it will happen. According to Mataji - it is blossom time and thousands of seekers will get their realization. A general-reaction to this statement is; what is so special about this time? Well, mother and when your mother is the Divine Mother, why fear anything!

 A LETTER OF SHRI MATAJI (Translation of a Marathi Letter of H.H. Mataji) LONDON Friday, Aug. 22, 1980 My dear Sahaja Yogi Petkar and other Sahaja Yogis, There was no occasion to write to you for very long time. These days I write only when some work comes up in Bombay, as the work is in full swing in England, However, people here are addicted and everywhere laziness and negativity have their full sway. England is the heart of Universe but it is so much neglected that it must be set in order without delay All of you are very fortunate to have been born in a holy place, especially Poona which is the place of Shri Ganesha. Try to understand that you have become entitled to God's such immense blessings only because of your several good deeds (Sukriti) in your previous births, I have given you only what was already yours and nothing of my own Much more is due to you and you shall get it My attention is attracted to impediments and pit falls. There is no problem about Poona and Rahuri people. Please do understand that, I feel relieved (in this atmosphere) to see you enjoying in the ocean of bliss, so keep it up. We, here, are not so fortunate as you are. Work is going on continuously. There are many difficulties, not for me, but for these foolish people. How can they be set right? There are many such problems. You should take interest and solve them because I do not wish anything and therefore the question of fulfilment of my wish does not arise. All of you should therefore keep a desire in your minds and pray for helping out your English brothers and sisters. Your progress is keeping the Sahaja Yoga alive in my heart. Whenever I feel fed up, your letters to feel satisfied. Therefore, please keep writing. All should write letters I read regularly. Ever yours, Your mother NIRMALA (Maha Avtar-1980)

 SEEKING Tondon, 24-07-1979 dead Those who say we are seeking are living Yesterday, I met a lady, and she told me that she was seeking God. I said what do you think of God? What are you seeking? When we say we are seeking, do we know what are we suppossed to seek and do we understand how we are going to feel our seeking complete and also seeking The little bit if you understand that a desire is created within a little animal called as amoeba by giving him hunger. Just think of it. It has no brain, it has just a small nuclear, but it can feel it's hungry. It has to eat something to grow. It also knows it has to reproduce and then it starts seeking. It also knows how to take the food in but it does not That we have reached the destination? Last time I told you that seeking has to be genuine, from a genuine heart, and that you cannot purchase or you cannot put in effort about it. But today I would like to tell you what are we seeking. Let us see how the seeking comes within us, from where? As shown here, there is a centre called "Nabhi Chakra', which is know how it digests. That part is not his job. Even for us it's just the same So, the seeking starts in a little amoeba and the whole evolution is based on that seeking, gradualy improving and improving the ways and means of seeking while the desire is that of food only, alone. here in the centre Nabhi Chakra which is placed in our spinal There is also another desire or you can say cord and manifests the solar plexus, which is placed midway under your naval. This is the centre that creates the seeking within us. Seeking is only possible when something is living. For example, what is the seeking of this chair? It cannot think, it cannot move, you can put it here or you can put it on the street. You can smash it and throw it away, again use that wood for some others purpose or make a an emotion in the smallest of Amoeba is the sense of preservation. It knows the dangers that can finish his existence. When this little amoeba becomes a human being in thousands and thousands of years then the seeking is changed. In the beginning it starts, of course the food seeking is still there. That's the basic You must have food to begin with, of course the methods are improved, changed, evolved. for the seeking of food but there is also a stool out of it. It has no seeking of any kind. Only when a thing becomes the living being great understanding of how to preserve yourself and your clan. The clubbing starts like a amoeba you carn take a unicellular act. It starts manifesting, seeking because it is supposed to seek, not the dead. So, those who say we are not seeking are as good as from a very early age, even ants understand that. So, they understand that we all have to club together, unite together, integrate together

 39 Issue: 11 & 12- 2004 The Divine Cool Breeze Now money animals don't understand, this is the creation of human beings only. So, for if we have to protect ourselves and this seeking of wholesomeness also develops gradualy in the human beings and the expressions of that is you can see all our efforts to preserve them money becomes very important because it is their own creation. We had barter systems ourselves and to be clubbed together. These efforts are expressed in our political and in our economic enterprises. but then we thought it is better to have some sort of a medium which will convert one good into another, so we start the money So, the focus of man's attention, from food, goes to Now, in the human beings a new seeking power and from power to money. Sometimes starts, is to have power over others. Animals if somebody has lots of money then he wants do not seek power, they have. For example a to have power. It's but natural. There is nothing tiger is much more powerful than say a poor wrong in it. rabbit. He is more powerful and a rabbit does not want to become a tiger. He does not try. Fundamentally it is a thing which is natural for human beings to run after money and then IS Like every Dick, Tom and Harry would like to become a Prime-Minister but a rabbit would run after powver or vice versa. But beyond that starts another seeking, it is the seeking of knowing why are we here? What are we doing here? What is the purpose of our life? Why God has created us? To what purpose, to what end or it is just a joke going around? not try to be a tiger He understands I am a rabbit and I must develop my means of defences and my means of offenses by which I exist. In the same way the tiger acts; he is aware of his powers and also he is aware of his limitations. And some of the animals also Are we just foolishly being born, getting married, having children and dying like amoeba have a power of leadership in them. They become leaders, you must have seen the, say, birds that they have a leader. One leader going and whenever the that leader changes the or have we any other purpose? Many human beings do not go beyond money or health They want good health. I mean animals don't direction, all of them change as we say are like the tail of that leader. In the same way, I know. But human take any exercises as far as being can go to any extent to preserve their health but for what? I mean you may be a wrestler for what? Just to fight each other? the same way that goes that bird goes, the leader goes all of them follow. So, this also is expressed in human being in a very big way that there are some born leaders who lead a You might be the healthiest person living on this earth but for what? You are just a weight. group of people to some destination in which they fulfil the seeking of that group. Now, the seeking of the groups could be money. Mostly What is your LISE? You may be the wealthiest man going in the best cars or whatever you may call it, all the so called luxuries of life and it is. IS.

 Issuc: 11 & 12-2004 40 The Divine Cool Breeze material well being, but for what? When such have really given him the fulfilment and the answer to this question, "why are we here', then the turning point takes place in his life and he becomes a seeker, not before that. a question comes into our mind the new kind of seeking starts which asks the question, "Why are you here?" "Are you here just to run in this rat race morning till evening earning money and earming power and doing all useless activities, pleasing others to show off your money or to extract some money from others? Is that the aim of your life?" Now, this is the beginning of the fourth enquiry or the fourth dimension in your awareness. This Those who go to Gurus and say Mother will you please give a job to my son, then you don't know what to say, you should say to such a person now my child you are not yet fit, you are not yet mature to come down here. Or if you go to someone to ask for say a diamond ring or anyone says that I give diamond ring in the name of God and you are enquiry is also the flowering of the same rudimentary thing called as hunger, hunger for spirituality, hunger for God, hunger for higher quite satisfied with such an answer then you are no good as a seeker. No, useless for Sahaja Yoga specially, or somebody who says I will cure you and for curative you go to things of life. This starts within us. That I call is the genuine happening. In this seeking, we get confused because by the time this seeking someone, alright a person may cure you but starts, you are already famished and finished. How? Because you are already conditioned by all kinds of nonsensical things going on. you are no good as a seeker Why should one cure anyone who is not seeking God? I mean why should I repair this instrument if it is not You may be calling yourself a British or an going to carry my voice? Or else some of I don't Indian or some sort of an Australian or you, if you go to a guru and if he tells you a like this that you have to pay me some know all sorts of things that people call themselves. But in the eyes of God you are story money for this because if you don't pay me money you cannot be involved in this kind of thing, you better slap such a guru on his face just a human being. I mean you don't have a tail to begin with and you don't have your head bent down like this. You have a head and tell him that what do you think of me? It's uprise, whether you are in Africa or in India or in England or America, It's just the same. As long as your head is up like that and you don't have a tail, of course some people must say, we have it, the way they behave, you are definitely a human being. And if a human being is evolved through various experiences of life and realises that none of these experiences complete indignity to your seeking. He wants to involve you through taking money from you. Can't you see that he is insulting you by saying that you are such a materialist that when you give me money then only you will be attached to seeking of God? Just think of it. All such arguments people give you and if you accept them and if you follow such gurus, you cannot

 41 Issuc: 11 & 12 - 2004 The Divine Cool Breeze mature for seeking and you have to be genuine, you have to be wise to understand that you are seeking your fulfilment You are not seeking when the child is born and gradually all the sensations and cordinations of all these different sensory organs and organs of motion and organs of automatic functions are created gradually, very gradually as he starts growing But once the connections are established a money and diamond rings and this Tomfooleries that are going on and you are not there to witness them and this foolish human being starts acting on his own, the whole body acts together, it knows when it is pinched here in the finger the whole body knows that you are pinched, the whole knows about what has happened. The whole connection is established. It's a living process, it is a growing process which works out. But with human beings there is a very big problem. The biggest problem I would say, that they are always identified with their imperfections, with wrong ideas and only in the human beings these things magical tricks of people but you are going to witness the magic of God Then in the seeking also you must know that if the God is the universal being, anybody who professes that we are the chosen ones and nobody else can be a chosen one or he was the only prophet or he was the only God, because we belong to some organisation, it is nothing but absurd fanatisism and ugliness. Do not deceive yourself Please try to understand, self deception will never be forgiven by God. Amoeba, does he deceive himself, if he sees the food there, does he? Or a lion or even a happen, that is why one has to be careful. Dog does very better than you do and it knows what to eat, wvhat not to eat You don't know! You don't know what is the real gunÄ± and a dirty guru and a horrible guru and a vicious frog? It has such a little brain! It understands what it is seeking. Will he deceive himself? But human beings deceive themselves morning till evening. We have to seek God, we have to seek our fulfilment, we have to relate to that man. You cannot make out. Somebody runs out of the jail, he weares a dress, comes to England and the guru great and thousands will be running after him. They don't know, and the more he has the better it is. But there is a wholesomeness that is God the primodial being, the whole of it. This is what we have to seek. You are created for that. If you study a little fetus in the womb of the mother, you will be way. God has already placed that within yourself. For your growth he has placed within you, only He is testing your genuineness. But if you are so obstinate as to stick on to some misidentified, nonsensical thing, you cannot amazed that the whole of the fetus is looked after by the naval cord from the mother and though all the portions of it are not yet fully developed as to get connected with the brain work it out. Be free from all these things. Open out yourself. You all have to be aware of the completely from the very beginning, till through one channel it is fed, looked after, managed whole. You all have to get Self Realisation. Then the child is removed from the mother

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 42 The Divine Cool Breeze Though by that God will feel his fulfilment of his creation no doubt and He has to do it, He blind making you blind. What have you achieved but nothing, but stark fanaticism? It's will do it. But He will have to work very hard and still and still if you do not accept the truth then the truth will be expressed no doubt but then the untruth has to be destroyed and at that time those who are identified with the a disease. It's sickness. Just come in the kingdom of God and you will see that they are seated there on the dais. They are ll together and you like fools are fighting! Did they ever say that, for example when Christ came did he say that Moses was wrong? Did he say so? When Nanaka came did he say that Mohammad was wrong? Did any one of these great saints say so? Then who are you untruth will also be destroyed. Before that take it to you wisdom and know what we have to seek. We have to seek our wholesomeness which we have partially expressed in our political and our economical and social clubs. All this has to be integrated. All the great religions which have been propounded in the growth of human beings, which have substantially helped in the growth of human beings, which are the substratum of their living, to denounce them? This is one of the greatest hurdles of so called seekers. Then they are identified with their gurus. I ask them one question, if you are so much identified with your gurus, go ahead with them, why do you come to me? I come to you has to be integrated in that happening. For Mother because I am suffering from Asthma, example I meet suppossing a Hindu, then he says Mother, how do you talk of Christ? We don't believe in Christ. Now, you are a very since I went to that guru. Then ask him to cure you. Why do you come to me? If guru had given you whatever you wanted, why should you come to me? If he is a real guru, I would see it written large on your face. I can make it out and I will worship that man who is a real guru. I will go all out to meet such a your great person not to believe in Chirst! Who are you not to believe in Christ? What do you think of yourself? What do you mean by saying that you don't believe in Christ? Do you know it is blosphemous to say such horrible things about any great incarnation on this person and I will regard him as the greatest blessing for me also. But they are very few and all hidden in the Himalayas or some places from where they do not speak. Nobody listens to them. They are very few. One of them tried to go to America. Within five days he was back in India. He wrote to me saying Mother very difficult. Because you are identified with earth? There are some who say we do not believe in Moses or in Gurunanaka or in Mohammad Saheb. Who are you? I don't believe! I don't believe you. What is your belief? On what it is based? Why do you say such things? What do you know about them? Only by going to churches or going to these games, with playing games, you like people who play games with you. You do not like mosques or going to these cinemas. They are

 The Divine Cool Breeze Issue: 11 & 12- 2004 43 people who tell you the truth. This is it, you have to have it. But you must know it is the concern. How can anybody who loves you can tell you something that is detrimental, injurious or absolutely dangerous for you? They will not tell you, those who are fake will never tell you about anyone. They will say O! everything is fine on the other side of the earth. If somebody genuine comes up they are not But from the very beginning I have to warn you, all such people are wasting their time and my time. So please, all such people who are still very much misidentified, please do not trouble me with their arguments too much because always I find that they are supposed to be true seekers like the lady yesterday and she started telling me, have you read this book and have you read that book? I said I would but by reading them I do not find anything in going to say a word about it Take it from me you. You have read them! What have you So, in your seeking, first of all your misidentifications must drop out. You are so achieved? Have you achieved anything? Nothing Have you seen this guru and that guru and that guru and that guru. I said may misidentified with so many things, like people would say why should we follow Christ? He was a jew. I mean he has to be born in someplace, somewhere and if it happens, you have to belong to some religion somewhere. You have to be born in England or you have be, but what about you? What have you got? She has Asthma, one eye is blown off. She cannot sit, she has got a rigid body because she says she has rheumatism. She is actually possessed, and there she is a seeker and then I am a to be born in India or may be in Timbucktoo. mean you have to be born in someplace. So, the rest of them, they know and those who live there also say, he is no good because he was just born like us here. They want a question Mother, she asked me seeker and why should God be so unkind to me?" You did not use your wisdom my child, even today take heed to wisdom and know that Thy God loves you with all his heart, with all his soul, whether you love him or not. He somebody to drop from heaven. It is so funny. So for us those who are genuine seekers, must open their minds fully, and if you want to waste your time, go on. You go ahead with your has placed this seeking within you. He has placed all this instrument within you. He has placed all the things so beautifully that spontaneous it works in no time But people are such, they come for realisation and if I tell gurus. Go on wondering their marvels, giving them money, giving them your women, giving them your property, giving them everything that you have, getting sick, mad, ending up with lunatic asylam. I will not say, come my child, them alright you come and sit near me. No, I won't sit! You please take out your shoes. No, I won't take out my shoes! There are like that, even if you tell them why don't come to me. But even then from the lunatic asylam also if you realise your mistake and come then God is the ocean of forgiveness. many you sit down with both the feet like this

You don't say my legs improved because there were lights, No. My eyesight improved because of my lights, because there were no lights there was a problem. As soon as there is a light everything are many more reasons for what I say, why I say. But still, No, Why should I do? There are certain things which are very important for Self-Realisation. If you want to have it, you better do them. The whole attitude should be becomes alright and you start understanding the whole, you know how the whole thing is, and you start walking straight and you know of understanding that here you have to take from me something. It's a gift for you and there should be no obstinacy about taking gift. where to sit and what is the chair and what is 1 mean that we do in normal courses, If there the person. is a gift for us then we do not become obstinate about it. Do we? Do the human beings become This is what you are seeking when you are a seeker and if you are a true seeker you are to be blessed, and its my job to see to it that obstinate when there is a gift coming in? But only when it comes to God, they wouldn't even take out their shoes! It's such a great thing you are asking for, which is the flowering of your seeking from Amoeba stage to human you reach there. You get your own powers, not of your guru but of your own and that understand yourself You get yourself you knowledge and the the knowledge of the whole. But if you are not that, my children, stage. In the human stage also thousands of years you have been seeking and today when you are at the threshold of it, why are you obstinate? I say in Sahaja Yoga you get your am sorry, you are still a baby in the seeking. You have to still grow more and grow more and then you come to me, when you are grown Self-Realisation. No money is to be given or enough, otherwise it is a headache to work on taken As a byproduct you get your health alright, of course your material things also are the person like that or to give them Self alright; many things improve as a blessings of Sahaja Yoga but the real thing that happens to you is that you get Self Knowledge, you get Self-Realisation, that there is light enlightened within you and you start seeing yourself, your Realisation or anything whatsoever. They are using sometimes, Sahaja Yoga for curing. You do get cured, no doubt, even cancer can be cured with Sahaja Yoga. It can be. It can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga centres and the centres of others because you That's the point. But again it will come back also get contacted with the whole, you get to you, we cannot promise guaranty anything. Unless and until you rise in Sahaja Yoga and your wholesomeness. This is what Sahaja Yoga has to offer to you and if you want to have that please have it. The rest of it is just become the mnaster of Sahaja Yoga we cannot guarranty. You may get back that disease again. Why should God not have a sense of a byproduct because if there is a light you do

 Issue: 11 & 12 - 2004 45 The Divine Cool Brecze giving for something as you have. He loves you, not doubt He wants to give you because he loves you, But if you are wayward and if they see the pulsation of the Kundalini, the Tising of the Kundalini, they get better in health and everything inmproving, still they are doubting and wasting their time! Their everything is delayed, their cure is delayed, and everything is delayed because of that. Alright, so we have here jet planes, we have here supersonies, we have missiles and we have also bullock carts, you are prodigal by nature, why should He continue to give you? It is a simple question that you should ask yourself and then ask for realisation, you get it After getting it also there is a period of doubts, because first you get Thoughless Awareness which is called as See it takes lot of things to make this world. Isn't it? So I take everything alright with all my love 1 indulge them But I would request Nirvichar Samadhi, when we say Awareness, in the normal termonology it means alertness to anything is awareness, but when we say Samadhi it means Enlightened Awareness. You you not to slow your progress like this. What are your doubting is the question that I do not want anything, if you are paying for something then you should doubt it. You are not paying for anything. What are you doubting? What am I to gain from you? But still so many of get Thoughtless Enlightened Aawareness and then you get Doubtless Enlightened Awareness. The state between the two, in some people is so little that they just are there. I have some people here who just got it and are there. They don't pass through these two stages, them sometimes come and tell me Mother now, Ð°Ð³Ðµ but we are doubting I say alright go on. When there are mediocres and there are also your doubts will be over you do come and see me. That's how it is. I would request you absolutely bullock carts, I would call them. They cannot move with the time of a jet In these modern times imagine a bullock cart being pulled by a jet! Big problenm. But if you are of that caliber and that quality, you get to try to tell your mind that you have done all kinds of things, you have been to all sorts of gurus, you have been to all sorts of nonsensical books and you have been to all kinds of doubts. Now, settle down for a while. Settle both the stages just like that. There's no doubt after that. But then there are some who get down. Tell your mind not to mislead and you into doubts I don't know what they doubt get it. This your own. This is your own property. This is your own right to be there So get it and if any doubts are coming then here? They had the experience, they feel the vibrations coming, they feel cool breeze flowing through them, they feel it is working on others, tell them to wait for a while. May God Bless you all

 A LETTER OF SHRI MATAJI
(Translation of a Marathi Letter of Shri Mataji)
LONDON
11th July, 1980
To,
Sahaja Yogis,
Received your cable on the eve of Gura Purnima. The sentiments, which you have
expressed in very beautiful words have gone to heart.. On the occasion of Guru Purnima day
celebrations in London, I explained what is self realisation and whether you have got it or not.
I will send the tape recording of this speech with some one instead of sending it by post.
suggested, in my earlier letters, to think of "Atma tattwa". Because you are "Atma
Swaroop", your mind, intellect and ego, should be enlightened by the "atma-jyoti". The light of
wisdom shines in the intellect only when Atma-jyoti illumines in its fullness. Then, mind emits
fragrance of love and ego does great and noble works, the whole of your inner being is fully
enlightened. You should be able to rely on the Atma tattwa, accommodate others in it, but first
stabilize it.
Many of the Sahaja Yogis have cured a number of diseases. They have immense love
for me and others These people could do all this because they have become experts owing to
their "Poorva-Sampada". However, there are many intellectuals among us who have not been
able to go very far on the strength of their knowledge or wisdom. Sahaja Yoga is lacking in
books We will have to write books in each language. Also, Sahaja Yogis should go to differenent
cities and give lectures. Many people send their poems to me. We should collect all these.
Similarly my letters can also be printed. Such publicity is necessary. Let it be known all over
the world that Sahaja Yoga is the only way to save the world in Kaliyuga. I am writing a book
but it is not useful to all at present. All should think on what I have suggested. Every centre may
also be accordingly advised.
Many blessings from Mother to all Sahaja Yogis.
Always remembering you
Your mother NIRMALA

yourself. The magnetism is a magic, is to magic
of a person. A person is magnetic because he
has certain magic. Now this magic comes from
your own personality, from your own
personality. So the basis of magnetism on the
left hand side starts and that basis is Shri

have? And the second one is the quality of
magnetism. Two things-weight & magnetism.
First is the quality of weight; that's how much
dignified you are? How you talk? How your
language is? How your behaviour is? You
should be humane, But sometimes, even with
Ganesha Shri Ganesha is the basis of that
magnetism. So your innocence; innocence is
the best way to have that magnetism.
Magnetism you cannot explain in material way
It is not a material stuff But it is something
abstract, comes from your quality of Ganesha,
Shri Ganesha. Such a person is magnetic.
Magnetic means such a person attracts other
person because of the weight of the person,
because of the quality of the person. Such a
person attracts, but does not attract for lust,
greed and non-sensical things. But attracts
another person because of the fragrance of
love in the subjects. Now it is always confused,
confused because it is such an abstract thing
So one must understand it in a very subtle
way. What is the magnetism-that one should
understand. You see, there are some gestures
people use artificially which normally they have
been using just to attract other people, the
way they walk, the way they dress, the way
they live, All these things are of no use. It is
something so inner, that fragrance is so inner
which must be developed. But in Sahaja Yoga
I have seen, people just do not bother about
it. Just do not bother. They think the way they
have been living, the way they have been doing
this-say if they are English, they are English, if
me, I find, people talk in a very funny manner,
just don't understand, how it is that always
they say the wrong thing. I mean, whenever
they have to say one sentence, they will say a
wrong thing. It is absolutely with them. It is
also Vishuddhi, which is also Nabhi, Comes
from Nabhi because you must know that
Vishuddhi Chakra is the ascent of the Nabhi
Chakra. So what happens is that the person,
whatever he is, is expressed through his
language, through his behaviour, through his
face, through his nose, his eyes, everything,
through the Vishuddhi Chakra. So the ascent
of the Nabhi is expressed, shown through the
Vishuddhi Chakra. Now whatever you have
in the Nabhi, is shown here. Supposing, now
a person who has the Mahalakshmi tattwa
properly developed, such a person will have
a way of dealing with another person when he
will have the weight, as well as the
understanding, how far to go with the person?
How far to carry on with that person? How
far to talk to a person? How far to think about
it? How much importance to be given? That
is one point, is very important.

the quality of magnetism is such that it attracts
people, you will achieve that charismatic

Now this is a very important point we should
know. You see, if you have other loves, love
like carnal love and all other love you have,
temperament, you cannot. You cannot achieve
that height. So how do you achieve it? By
becoming more innocent.
Now how innocence develops in a person is
then that love may attract the person, then
that person can destroy you and it destroys
you, always. But this attraction does not
destroy, does not destroy. The attraction is
upto that point that you are not destroyed,
because you being much higher, much deeper
and much weightier, you cannot be destroyed
by a thing that whom you are attracting.
Always the greater magnet attracts the smaller
magnet. And that is what one should
understand. This magic and this charisma,
charismatic temperament of a person, comes
by, first of all, the Ganesh tattwa, innocence.
And secondly by complete dedication and
devotion. Those who are completely

Actually these things could not take place in
the West. Because even if they had come out
of the Mother Earth who would have

them? Who would have worshipped them?
That is why it did not happen in the West too
much. But it is there, little bit is there, no doubt.
But here now we have these, all these temples
and the attack on the innocence has come
from the tantrikas. And so the tantrikas rented
out this temple and they tried to establish
themselves. And gradually they are being
neutralised and cleaned out. These tantrikas
have gone into every temple of all the
Goddesses, and they will be gradually all out,

 Reality of Life
Umpteen religious and other theories of
reaching God exist in the world today. Every
individual has his notions about God Almighty.
As such, one's belief and faith depend to a
comprehension. This is so because they have
discovered certain sources of energy which
they have been able to use to their ends, thus
controlling them. An energy which controls
them is not acceptable. However more than
anything else they just befool themselves. Don't

the Lord. There are so many other things which
give him newer ideas about God; namely
books, people and the countless Gurus who
circulate these days. In the end a person ends
up having a cock-eyed idea of the Lord or he
stops believing in God. Psychologists come
up with statements like believe in God because
of fear, conditioning and a whole string of other
reasons. What they fail to see is that God is
not anybody's opinion, nor is He a fictional
character who exists because people believe
in Him due to some reason but that He is the
sole reality. Everything owes its existence to
Him. A new idea which has now entered the
heads of people and is rather frequently stated
very dramatically is that - "We do not believe
in God, but in a supernatural power". What
they cannot understand and see is that there is
no difference since this supernatural power is
none other than the Power of God, the Divine

ideas exist, eg. Life is for living and that is it'

 A LETTER OF SHRI MATAJI
(Translation of a Marathi Letter of H.H. Mataji)
LONDON
Friday, Aug. 22, 1980
My dear Sahaja Yogi Petkar
and other Sahaja Yogis,
There was no occasion to write to you for very long time. These days I write only when
some work comes up in Bombay, as the work is in full swing in England, However, people here
are addicted and everywhere laziness and negativity have their full sway. England is the heart
of Universe but it is so much neglected that it must be set in order without delay
All of you are very fortunate to have been born in a holy place, especially Poona which
is the place of Shri Ganesha. Try to understand that you have become entitled to God's such
immense blessings only because of your several good deeds (Sukriti) in your previous births,
I have given you only what was already yours and nothing of my own Much more is due to
you and you shall get it My attention is attracted to impediments and pit falls. There is no
problem about Poona and Rahuri people. Please do understand that, I feel relieved (in this
atmosphere) to see you enjoying in the ocean of bliss, so keep it up. We, here, are not so
fortunate as you are. Work is going on continuously. There are many difficulties, not for me, but
for these foolish people. How can they be set right? There are many such problems. You should
take interest and solve them because I do not wish anything and therefore the question of
fulfilment of my wish does not arise. All of you should therefore keep a desire in your minds
and pray for helping out your English brothers and sisters.
Your progress is keeping the Sahaja Yoga alive in my heart. Whenever I feel fed up,
your letters to feel satisfied. Therefore, please keep writing. All should write letters

Ever yours,

they see the pulsation of the Kundalini, the
Tising of the Kundalini, they get better in health
and everything inmproving, still they are doubting
and wasting their time! Their everything is
delayed, their cure is delayed, and everything
is delayed because of that. Alright, so we have
here jet planes, we have here supersonies, we
have missiles and we have also bullock carts,
you are prodigal by nature, why should He
continue to give you? It is a simple question
that you should ask yourself and then ask for
realisation, you get it After getting it also there
is a period of doubts, because first you get

absolutely bullock carts, I would call them.
They cannot move with the time of a jet In
these modern times imagine a bullock cart

are of that caliber and that quality, you get
to try to tell your mind that you have done all
kinds of things, you have been to all sorts of
gurus, you have been to all sorts of nonsensical
books and you have been to all kinds of
doubts. Now, settle down for a while. Settle
both the stages just like that. There's no doubt
after that. But then there are some who get

tell them to wait for a while.
