Shri Krishna Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 1 September 1996.

Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna. See how cold it was about three o’clock. Now the reason is this, that Shri Krishna did little mischief with Indra. Indra, who is a god or you can say a semi-god, for looking after the rain. So, Indra got very angry. You see, all such semi-gods are very sensitive people. At the smallest thing, they get angry and irritated, and they start using their powers to express their anger. So he started pouring rain on all the gopas and Shri Krishna who were looking after the cows. And the rain was so heavy that they thought that the whole land would be completely submerged. So Indra was very happy to spoil the game of Shri Krishna. And he thought he was very successful. So Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His finger, and all these people who were getting drowned went under that mountain. This is Shri Krishna’s style. My style is different. I told Indra that “You cannot misbehave with me. You cannot. So far I have not harmed you in any way. And I have not irritated you. Of course, it is going to be Shri Krishna’s Puja. But that does not mean that you should try to show off your powers before Me.” Sometimes I wonder these devas, semi-gods, they are Realized souls or not? Because why do they get angry like this for small things? Whatever it is, he could be reconciled, and now it has become warm, I must say.

With Sahaja Yoga you can do many, many things, but you must know what you can do. For that, Krishna is a very good example. He started Sahaj culture. Culture, I am saying. He did not give Realization to anyone, but He gave the idea of Sahaj culture. How? Before Him came Shri Ram, who was Maryada Purushottama. Who was a man very particular about everything. I mean, like He threw out His wife because He was a king, and a king cannot have a scandal, specially from His wife. So He threw Her out. It was not Kali Yuga, that’s why. And His father ordered Him to go, not His father so much as His stepmother, to go to, go in an exile into a forest. So, He agreed. After all, He was Maryada Purushottama. So whatever His father said, He agreed. Whatever His mother said, He agreed  and went into the forest, stayed there fourteen years. This is the obedience to the father. It was no need. His father was not God. He was God, but in those days it was important to make people not only respect the parents, but also to obey them. That was the time.

In His time, there were many munis and many saints and also Hatha yogis. And these, even before Him, used to make people practice very strict type of discipline. And if they did not practice the discipline, they had to do a lot of penance. And so many people who tried, also never reached the goal, because of the strictness and complete discipline about following the path of spirituality.

Recently I was reading a book called “Peaceful Warrior”. There, they have described an American seeking the truth, and the guru of that fellow really, really takes him to such a horrible, severe task, that My grand daughter said: “I am very angry with such a guru!” [Shri Mataji laughs] She couldn’t bear it. So ultimately he finds that he is the existence. So that was the practice followed after Shri Rama. People would leave their wives, children,  go to Himalayas, and sit there and practice meditation. It was a very rigorously followed, we should say, a very moral society. So very moral! But it was out of fear. The whole morality came through fear, which is also repeated in other religions. Now I should say that Islam today has taken that form. It’s the fear, they are not doing it out of freedom. Also Christians, same things, and Hindus, I don’t know: half way this side and half way that side. Even among Sikhs, there is terrible disciplining. So much so that, as punishment, you have to clean the shoes of all the people. I don’t know if it is to beat yourself with shoes or otherwise, but quite a lot of punishment is there.

Then came Shri Krishna. And He saw the situation, that the way people are really now, fasting. If you really go through the rituals of Hindu religion, out of one week, you’ll be fasting for six days at least. One day you might eat some sort of a food. Then you’ll have to visit all kinds of places. Now recently they had to go, as you know, to Amarnath. And so many died there. So now they said: “We have got nirvana. We have died while doing this, so we have got nirvana. “ This kind of a very funny idea was existing. That “we have a nirvana now, we have achieved whatever we wanted, and now we are dead”. So many are dead, so those who were not dead were repenting why there were not dead, would have been much better, they would have got their nirvana. [Shri Mataji laughs] So, even in this kali Yuga, these ideas are prevalent.

Even in India, people have very severe types, specially in the south, I’ve seen, they do all kinds of nonsense, for the torment or maybe for something they are asking for. All this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna. He couldn’t understand that they are going to waste all their lives with this kind of ritualistic ruling, then what will remain out of them for Sahaja Yoga? So He’s the one who started Sahaja culture. He said: “Let us enjoy. We must have enjoyment”. Nirmal anand, pure joy. How do we have pure joy? He had this Raki bandhan, by which, apart from your wife, everybody is your sister or mother.  I must say it is so much true for the Indians. Not so much in the north because of Islamic influence, but in the south it is so. In Maharashtra it is so. And then He started also this Holi, in which we should play with colors. Maybe to get rid of this color barriers we have,  maybe. In America it is a very good idea to play with colors, and put some black on the whites and some white on the black. And they can see for themselves how stupid it is to fight in the name of color.

He used to play with children who were looking after cows, just like a very ordinary person.  He never tried to show off his powers.  He never tried to stand out,  never would dress up in a very special way, never.  Just like an ordinary cowherd.  And his relationship with his mother, Yeshoda - she was not his mother - was also extremely beautiful.  There are so many beautiful poems written about his childhood. That, he's the one who is in charge of the whole universe.  As a little boy used to put his finger into his mouth wondering - how can a Divine Virata do that?  What is his thinking like a child?  All his actions of children.   Yesterday's song, as you heard it, is this.  All these little, little actions are described very well.  Especially by another very great poet, Surdas, who was blind. His childhood is described in a very beautiful manner and the description of his relationship with his mother is very natural and very sweet.  It was not like this, as modern times, a carpet is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet you have spoiled, I'll hit you hard, this carpet you have spoiled".  They have more interest in their things than in their own children.  But according to our culture, if the child breaks anything, you have to say this "very good you have broken, some badha has gone away".  Never to scold a child for doing anything which you think is destructive - because he then will definitely become destructive.  So to understand a child, I think you must read those poems, beautiful poems which are written about Shri Krishna.  I don't know how their imagination reached that beautiful height of pure joy.

So towards our children also, we have to be extremely sweet and nice and forgiving.  But some children, of course, I meet are difficult, but they also can be corrected if you really apply Shri Krishna's methods to him.  Now when he went to college, or we can say into the school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru.  The guru's wife was very kind. But the guru was strict.  And his wife used to look after him and when she gave him something for food when they would go and bring some woods from the forest.  It is very subtle, you know the whole thing is.  He went there and his friend was carrying the food.  His friend was carrying the food and Shri Krishna was busy cutting the wood, imagine?  Shri Krishna was cutting the wood for the mother.  I mean, for the mother he could do anything, he was God.  So no work for the mother was menial or lower.  But the other fellow, the friend of his, he was very hungry, so he ate all the food and nothing was left.  So when he came down, he got very much worried.  He went and told his guru that "I ate all the food and I didn't share it with Shri Krishna".  The guru got very angry, very angry and he said "now, you will be cursed with permanent poverty".  But the mother said "no, not permanent - till you meet Shri Krishna again".  That's how she tried to do it, we call it Upashad, in that you give another curse which can neutralize partly.  The same friend, was Sudama, and he was very very poor.

Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, he always used to remember Sudama and he told his wife that I really I don't know, he's cursed, I don't know what must be his condition, where he must be?  Now the friendship - he was a king, such intimacy of feeling with a friend.  He said "I used to go with him, I used to collect the woods. I mean, imagine all these little, little things had such a big importance for him.  So, he was not only worried about the whole world, as he should have been, but also about Sudama - When will I meet him? When will I see him again? Where must be his house? How he must be living?  All these very delicate feelings he had for his friend.  Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole world and also individually we are worried.  We come to know about one person who has fallen sick, who has a problem, something is serious.  All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are worried about him, they may have everything, but still they are worried, what is happening to such and such a person.  How many of us know each others names - I mean he knows everybody's name - practically.  And how we care for them, how we respect them, how we love them and how we have pure relationships.  Today is also the day of Rakshabandhan, which is a very great thing that we should have pure relationships.

I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go and talk to women very much and women won't go and talk to men.  And once, somebody remarked - "Then what are you women doing, talking to women only?".  So, I said what are we to talk to you?  You are talking about your office, we are talking about our houses and homes.  What is there to talk to you?  The western culture is different, they will force you.  They'll make one man sit here and next to him should be a woman, somebody else's wife, then another man and then somebody else's wife.  How can you have intimacy?  This kind of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped into immorality.  There's no need for men and women to sit like that, what is the need, I just don't understand.  Compulsorily you have to sit.  I've had a bad time, I tell you, with my husband's job, I never liked it.  What is there to talk to these men, after all, I don't know anything about banking, I don't know shares, I don't know stock exchange, what it is.  Or I don't know profits,  and this and that - that part is zero.  Then, I don't know about office, I don't know many other things men talk about, so what is there to talk to them - it is so very difficult.  And whenever I said something, I really dropped a brick.

Once in a party, they were offering drinks to everyone and then this, so I said "I will have a soft drink".  So the vali came and gave me a soft drink.  The vali was having a bow, and a white shirt, that's all, absolutely A-Sahaj methods.  Black bow, white shirt, black coat, black pant, all just the same - whether it is an ambassador or a vali.  You can't make it out who is who.  So I drank, you know, so when I was finished I gave it to an ambassador, a very well known ambassador.  To me there was no difference at all, when they are just say walking the same way, talking the same way.  So A-Sahaj the whole thing is.  They say they have so many Embassies, for what I don't know and they, what they have, always drinks, parties - shake hands, shake hands. Your hands will break, I tell you.  A most A-Sahaj method is to shake hands.  Why not say Namaste, it is better, and you know me.  Sometimes I used to get such heat.  Like yesterday you have shown that the ice melted.  The same thing used to happen to me.  Mostly they were very hot people and I didn't know what to do, I used to stand on one side just feeling shy.  But this method of hand shaking is absolutely A-Sahaj.  And worse than that is French method, is to kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.  Or to hug somebody.  The first time I gave realization to one English gentleman, he just lifted me up like that.  I said "alright - it's just out of joy he has done it, it's alright".  But there is no openness, there's no openness of heart.

You go to a party, you have to be dressed up like this only, if you are not dressed up like that, then you are useless.  If you go for a death also.  Somebody died, a great friend, a very nice man.  So I was told I had to wear a black sari.  Black blouse, everything black.  I said, "I have no sari, black without border, you know".  So they said "you don't go".  I said "Very good idea".  Because I don't know these A-Sahaj methods.  You are not supposed to cry or weep there, no, you have to keep quiet.  Then when you go there, the body is lying there, and after a prayer is said, you are supposed to drink champagne.  I mean, imagine it, how can you, no feelings, for that body which is lying there dead.  And everybody very happy, and if somebody looked unhappy, they would ask "what's wrong, are you alright?".  No consciousness that we have lost a friend here.  This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes to grief.  When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj, when it comes to grief it is A-Sahaj.  We have to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever we do, we do it spontaneously.  Not with deliberations.

We have some very anglicized people in India also.  And the lady of the house died and I went to see - and in India the body is taken down on the ground.  So they were discussing what to do, what time to start the funeral and all that.  So one lady, who is a very well-known person in India, she said "you should not do it before 12 o'clock".  I said "why"?  She said, "because I'll have to wear white".  "That's true".  "And  I 'll have to go to the bank to get my diamonds to match with the white sari".  I said "What is this?"  Such filth of materialism.  It is going too far, we are going away from our feelings, from our emotions, which are genuine, which are there all the time, you don't have to think about them, they exist all the time.  But you think "Now, should I cry or not? Should I laugh or not?  It's so spontaneous, if you have joy, you are spontaneous.  You express your joy spontaneously.  Of course, not in an uncultured way, but in a very cultured way.

Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture - this culture, is something that is, you are groomed, you are brought up, in a very natural manner, that you develop a culture.  A small, like, a child like, simple innocent behaviour.  It is Shri Krishna's introduction of idea of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which came as a great relief to Indian people because they were following Shri Ramachandra.  But then abandonment started.  The problem is, if you make them strict, they become like starched clothes I think, that you can't wear them.  Or if you allow them - no, no, you must enjoy, you must enjoy, alright, you allow them, do what you like.  If you allow them to do what you like, then they start doing all kinds of things.  In India, we had lots of horrible things, which I dare not even tell you - in the name of enjoyment.  But Shri Krishna himself has been very much misrepresented by stupid people like Vidyapati.  He was a great poet and he used Krishna and Radha as Romeo and Juliet.  That's the greatest insult to the purity of their relationship.  You must have seen many pictures like that, in Kangrashali, and this shali, that shali.  It's all nonsense.  They could not show the reality of the relationship, but some sort of a very vulgar expression.  Because I think these poets and these artists at that time had some hidden suppressed feelings within themselves and they used Shri Krishna for that.  All kinds of romanticism is attached to him.  Sometimes I feel that people have not understood Shri Krishna.

But there's a nice story about him.  That once, his wives, he had many wives, that is also another controversial point.  He had many wives, because these were 16,000 powers of Shri Krishna, who had taken birth and were captured by one king and kept in the prison.  So he had to release them, they were released.  Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna, he was a young man - so he married all of them.  That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.  He married all 16 of them, they were his powers.  For a young man to keep 16,000 women like a harem, what people would have thought of him.  So he married all of them.  And another point about his life is, that once all these ladies, and he had also five wives.  These five wives were the causal of the five elements.  So he had to go.

Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one great saint.  And the river, which was there, was all completely flooded.  So, they came to Shri Krishna and told him that "How are we to cross? - because this is over flooded.  He said "That's very easy to cross that river.  This river is called as the virgin river, Nirmada, now they are having big fights over it in India nowadays, a big politics.  So you go and tell her that "Oh river, if Shri Krishna is a complete celibate personality, perfect brahmacharya, if that is the truth, you go down".  And the river went down - and they crossed over.  Then they went and worshipped the saint and when they came back to the bank of the river it was again very much flooded.  So they went to that saint and asked him "Now, how are we to go back?".  He said "How did you come?".  They said "this is what Shri Krishna asked us to tell the river".  "Alright, you go and tell the river that this saint has not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing", while they saw him eating plates after plates, if this is the truth, then you better recede.  So, they went down and told the river, and the river went down.  They were amazed that this man ate such a lot of things and this river has gone down thinking this is the truth.  That means - what has been their character?.  They're abogis. They're abogis means, they do not get, indulge into it, they eat, alright, but they don't care, they don't have that feeling of eating, and feeling of enjoying the food, and nothing of the kind, they are just eating.  And this gentleman with 17, I should say 16,005 wives, is called as Brahmachari, because they are not involved.  They are in Sar  state.  With such a great immaculate personality like Shri Krishna, the way they have created this nonsense of romanticism.

For America, I think they have gone too far with the freedom they have.  As people with Shri Krishna's blessings became free from all the rules, regulations and got abandoned.   But America has gone much worse and not only that, but the films they are producing are very dangerous films and really damaging the whole world.  They don't know what sin they are committing, for thousands and thousands of people in the world have taken to all kinds of very destructive ugly ideas.  Freud, alright, he's ousted - finished, he's done already a great harm. But what about these films, they are now very much impressing our Indian directors.  I think all these directors are guiding Indians to hell.  The whole thing is so absurd and so dirty.  For an Indian mind it is really inconceivable.  Even, I have seen Americans can't bear it, it has gone that bad.  Then other things have started with this freedom that we have.  Imagine if Shri Krishna was here, he would never have put any oil in his head, he would have never combed his hair, as he must have his top knot. And he might have worn some mod dresses from America.  Otherwise, you cannot exist.

All the junk now has gone all over the world. Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing countries.  Only thing, when it was declared that they have AIDS - people used to buy even second hand from the tourists - they threw away all that.  They are carrying AIDS all over and drugs all over.  It's a destructive force.  It's a destructive force, which is very active in this Kali Yuga and so we have to have many Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive force.  And when they are destructive they are not hypocritical, that's they think is a very great quality.  But a least with hypocracy you can save some people but when it's just an open thing everybody starts doing that.

So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived and the beautiful time they had, of such clean life and how he killed all these demons, is something so beautiful, so energy giving.  But how many demons there are nowadays - is it one? is it two?, is it ten?  One is finished, another comes up like a mushroom, that is finished, third one comes up like a mushroom.  And the most fertile land is America.

So you all have to pay attention to this land of Shri Krishna.  Especially Shri Krishna should really start using his Sudashana Chakra, would be a good idea.  The time has come.  That's why I gave you the conch.  To declare the time has come to clean this America.  That is the thing we have to do.  Today when we worship Shri Krishna, you must awaken within you yourself, that consciousness, that now Shri Krishna is within all of you.  And by your communication, because he's collective, by your speech, by your songs, by all that you use to communicate with others, should carry the message of peace, of love, of compassion, of truth and above all of Sahaja Yoga.

May God bless you!
