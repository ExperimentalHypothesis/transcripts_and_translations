(Hindi Translation)

Today we are here to do the Guru's puja The Guru is praised more than the Deities and the Gods Who is this Guru? In this, which is the most important shakti? The Guru tattwa is the Shiva. The form of the Shiva's power we should consider as the Guru's power. Because when we take the powers from the Guru's shakti, and when the shaktis come within us then we ourselves become the Guru And with this, we are blessed for the whole life (Kalyan). The one who gets these powers, it seems he has got all the blessings (kalyan). "Kalyan" is a word which is very hard to explain in a few words. "Kalyan" means to get blessed from all the sides. the obtain joy from all the sides. When someone says that in the blessings you have got the Kalyan, what does it mean? What is Kalyan? Kalyan means Atma Sakshatkar, the Self-Realisation. Without the Self-Realisation, you cannot have the Kalyan. Nobody can understand without having it.

All these things are in the Kalyan. Because of this a person gets all the joy, and he becomes radiant. To have this Kalyan, whatever you have to do you have done it all, whatever efforts you have to make it has all been made, the faith which you have to take, you have already taken it. But when you are all in the "Kalyanmarg" (Path of Kalyan), when he has given the mantra to have the Kalyan, what does it mean? It means that the most important thing inside you is samadhan (satisfaction). Afterwards you all don't have to search for anything, you have all become the Gurus. You don't have to take some great things in this moment, but the blessings of this samadhana you all can feel inside yourselves, you all can know inside yourselves you all can enjoy within yourselves.

First of all you all can see that the physical diseases, the physical problems can be removed by this Kalyanmarg, all the problems which are coming within you that prevent you from blossoming, can be removed by this Kalyanmarg. When you all take to this, you get the Kalyan and you have the Self-Realisation. In this Shri Mahadeva is helping you. When the kundalini opens the Sahastrara, Shri Mahadeva is sitting over there. And because of this, we call Him Mahadeva. It means the God of all the Gods, Mahadeva. in this Kalyan there are many important aspects. The first thing is shanti (peace). Mental peace, physical peace and the peace in the family life. In the family life there are many problems, many obstacles, and all these can be solved by the Kalyanmarg. Afterwards we cannot even feel the presence of the obstacles. In this way we could see many people in the whole world getting blessings from this Kalyanmarg and meditating upon it and enjoying for the whole life. This is the Kalyan by which mankind can get the balances within themselves. And to obtain this balance, you have to go under the protection of the Guru. When you become the devotee of a Guru, you get the balance and you get everything.

After this you do not need anything. In this way we get the balance and we obtain the power of love within ourselves. When mankind obtains this, this whole body rejoices. When you obtain this state, the shaktis (powers) destroy all the problems, the disturbances in the body and the physical state, and so many people try very hard to obtain this shakti. He can get the shakti only form a person that is self-realised and then he himself becomes in the God's form.

English Talk

This is a subject which you can only explain in Hindi language. Which says that this Guru pad (state of Guru) you get from somebody else. But that somebody else is itself, is endowed with, the power, the power of peace of mind, to begin with, and also the power to overcome all kinds of earthly problems, mental problems, physical problems. All these problems you can solve through your mental balance and mental blessings from your Guru.

When you become the guru, you yourself have the power, to bless others. With your blessing power you can create a guru out of many. And once the guru is created and there is a guru, who has this power, it’s very satisfying and is very ennobling.

The satisfaction is so much that you don’t want anything. This is the power of Shiva. You have seen Shiva doesn’t have much clothes. He doesn’t decorate Himself. He is just sitting in meditative mood, all the time. He doesn’t want anything. He’s so satisfied with Himself that He doesn’t want anything. And that is the power you get after the Self-realisation, if you have a Guru, and Guru of that level and calibre.

One should not try to become a Guru: that’s very impractical. If you try to become, you will never. It has to come to you automatically, without any asking, without any effort. So the only way you can get to it is through dhyana. Dhyana is meditation. When you meditate - just meditate, and meditate. Do not ask for anything. Meditation itself gives you that instrument which can bear this great power of the Guru. And then you, automatically, you give this power to others. You don’t have to work it out, just in your presence people can get this power of complete satisfaction. And there is salvation for you and for others.

So all the problems which are faced for the journey of ascent are finished and you are drenched in the bliss of heavenly peace and joy. That’s why it is called as kaiyvalya, means only, only the bliss. See, that means there is no other word to translate it, there’s no other way of explaining it. It’s a state, it’s a stithi. It’s a state. In that state you have to rise and you know that you are in that state. It’s a very remarkable thing that, once you reach that state, you don’t have to ask for anything; it’s all there, and you are so satisfied.

I can go on talking about this special power but I think, whatever I have said, please meditate on that. And you are all capable of reaching that state. That state of complete peace and joy.

May God bless you.
