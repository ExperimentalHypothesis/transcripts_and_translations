"The light of love", Evening before Diwali Puja, Lake of Como (Italy), 24 Ottobre 1987.

[After the chant.]
May God bless you all.
And all the blessings of Lakshmi, all the Ashta Lakshmi, is upon you. May God bless you

Today we have come here to celebrate a great festival of Deepavali, meaning the rows of lights, or the Festival of Lights. It was to celebrate the coronation of Shri Rama also, that is to say symbolically to celebrate the establishment of a kingdom which has a benevolent administration.
Today I find all of you here as the lights sitting before Me and with these lights I feel the Deepavali really celebrated; I see the twinkling of those eyes, twinkling in the eye of that light which is within you. In the lamp of light we have to put something that is soft, like ghee; that's something very mild and soft, is the love of our heart. And that burns to give this soothing light of love to others.
Such a person who has this light of love loves himself as well and emits love for others. I've been hearing about the way people used to torture themselves to become saintly. There's no need at all for Sahaja Yogis, at all, to torture themselves. But to be the light of a higher magnitude they have to be full of love and this love they get it from where? You may say it is from Me. It's true but the sap of the tree flows all over and all the tree must live together. Any leaf that wants to separate itself will die out. So it's the collectivity which is going to make you grow. Any ideas which you have, which of... keeping yourself out, or preserving yourself out, or having your houses separate from the collectivity may be dangerous. The houses may be separate but they must be the houses of all the Sahaja Yogis. Anybody who comes to your house who is a Sahaja Yogi is owner of that house. That sort of a feeling should be developed. When the light you take out from one room to another room, it does not say 'This is my room so I'll give light, if I go to another room I will not give light.'
Now, light is absolutely detached. If you do not look after your light it will extinguish. You have to look after it till it takes its proper stand and once it takes a particular stand then you are a strong Sahaja Yogi. Then they see the light on your face and then you manifest light in their lives. This light, if you put finger on it, it will burn but the light of love never burns. It dissolves all that is bad, it rejects, it turns away from whatever that is wrong. It has patience and it expels the darkness. Darkness within and without.
Diwali day is specially meant to celebrate with the lights on a day when Lakshmi was born. Now this Lakshmi came out of the sea, and even today there's lot of Lakshmi lying under the beds of the sea. (Italian Sahaja Yogi has trouble translating and says "I'm sorry Shri Mataji I didn't understand." Shri Mataji continues...)
But when you do not understand the real significance of Lakshmi then it brings darkness and Lakshmi disappears. For example, somebody gets lots of money. Immediately he will have first class bar in the house. Then he'll have his friends to come and have drinks. He'll drink with them and suddenly he'll find that Lakshmi has disappeared. So wherever there is wine there is darkness and that darkness which comes to you with the Lakshmi makes Lakshmi just disappear.
The whole of the universe, the whole cosmos, is so well-knit that if you try to do one thing wrong this side, everything goes off. It is so well connected, like one bulb fuses everything fuses off. In Sahaja Yoga also it happens like this, that a person who is enlightened and tries to be nasty, tries to create problem, can make others negative. In the beginning it used to happen very often, like one bad apple can spoil all the good apples but one bad apple cannot be corrected by all the good apples. One Hitler could make many Hitlers. But in Sahaja Yoga when you are grown up and established, then one bad man, if comes, either he has to run away or he has to get well. A person like that himself he'll tie up all his luggage and go away.
But the main people, the people who are grown up and who are matured should keep their maturity and assert it. It's in the form of light, again. Now if there are many lights like these are, and one of them goes out, doesn't matter because its... there are so many others, like that. But if there is one light which is matured enough, even all of them go away, doesn't matter. So the people who are half-Sahaja Yogis or quarter-Sahaja Yogis, quatro, have to understand that they play no important role in Sahaja Yoga. Everybody has to become a full-fledged Sahaja Yogi. Then it matters a lot if any such Sahaja Yogi is sick or is in problem, all the angels would run to help him.
So today is a special day to celebrate the Kingdom of God on earth. As we used to pray 'Thy Kingdom come on this Earth' and it has come today on this mountain and we are here to celebrate the coming of the Kingdom of God as we have been praying for ages. And the blessings of Kingdom of God is that you get drenched in joy - joy which has no duality, like happiness and unhappiness. Is an experience of absoluteness and just that joy is sufficient, you don't want any food, you don't want to sleep, you don't mind where you are, just enjoy, drenched completely. There's no place for unhappiness, you have no heart for it. Italians were known to be melancholy people but now I find all of them are so joyous that nobody can believe that they could have been melancholy once upon a time. Not only that but they are giving so much joy.
The program should open our eyes, of all the Europeans, to see how on the stage they were singing songs to Me and everybody in the audience was clapping and enjoying it. Because Italians are very humble people and it is the humble who will be entering to the Kingdom of God and not the arrogant. They'll have to go to hell to get rid of their arrogance.
This is something, is very great that we are celebrating Diwali here, that in the place where people are humble and they have the right to be joyous. They have the right on their Mother, they have the right to ask for anything that they want. This is what is surrendering. Humble person means the person who doesn't have ego. So to burn off ego and to burn off our conditioning we had this festival called Holi. Holi. But now we have a new festival which is a festival of singing songs of joy. And joy alone. In this Diwali day let us wish that so many people fall into this ocean of joy and the ocean of joy has to expand its borders, shores. A sea never does that but Sahaja Yogis can do it because they have ocean of love in their hearts.
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali in the sense that you will enlighten more lights, every Sahaja Yogi should enlighten at least hundred lights in this year. Every person you meet you can talk to them about Sahaja Yoga, not about Me. Later on, gradually. So I hope you'll enjoy your Diwali here, all of you, and we'll create an ocean which will expand, grow and engulf more and more people into this joyous company.
Today I don't want to say that I am sorry because I came late, which won't be good on a joyous day like this. But waiting has its own dividends to pay, waiting gives you another kind of appreciation of meeting.
May God bless you all!
So we should continue with music...

[After 3:57:00]

Shri Mataji: I will tell you one thing, now just listen. You see, this song, the song that he has sung is like a lullaby. There is no tala, there is no rhythm that can fit this song. So poor man should not have been asked to do this. Once in My marriage, you see, there was one fellow, My father's friend who was a member of parliament, he wanted to sing, you see, didn't know any music or anything. Just started singing like this in some unrythmic way. So My brother whom you have heard, he asked My father: "What tala should I play?" He said : "Play Brahma tala!". Meaning: sleeping.

[about Rustom] "He analyses, so, he analyses and he says there must be in your childhood you have done something wrong, you see... He is a psychologist, you know, so he goes to the childhood of everything."

[Main address] "Everybody has their own personality is a very good sign. That's a very good sign that you all keep your personality and you don't merge into one personality. That variety creates all the beauty. You can see that how enjoyable it is to see the variety of people. You should all maintain your varieties, your dresses, everything the way you are. The change is inside not outside. So the outside it's very nice to have all these things of this kind and somebody should copy him also.

Alright, so, it was nice, you see, the way he has seen different-different people but I can see behind every personality there is a background, there is a training, there is a life and also I feel about people who want to express themselves in a way they are more effective that is [than?] what they accept. But sometimes we get - we go beyond.

Like, I will tell you an incident of Rustom was, that he told Rajeesh that we should all become now Nirvi??? [hesitation on the term] Nirakara, means "without any form", we should become formless. So, Rajeesh said : "How we become? " He said "You ask Mother. She will make you, all of us, formless." So, we were travelling by plane, Myself, Rajeesh, [two other names unclear Modi, Jala?], you know those people are very tall, hefty and I said don't say all these things, It's wrong to ask to become Nirakara, all that." He said: " So Rajessh was saying: "But he said so, we can ask for it."

We got up from the plane. We came out. In the aeroplane, you see,  everything was alright, we came out it was alright and there were twenty-five people who had come to receive us. They could not see us, none of us. We were trying to call them: "Come here, come here." Nobody would listen to us. We did not understand what was happening, you see. We had become Nirakara.

So we walked up to the driver and I gave him a bandhan so at least he recognised us - we got into the car... These people said: "We couldn't see you. We were  twenty-five people were there to receive, we couldn't see you. I said: "Now, don't listen to Rustom and ask for such things as Nirakara." [applause, jaykar]

Lots of interesting things happen like that, you see, and I told then Rustom : "Now, don't ask for all these things from Me because it's wrong, you see. You should ask now: "Mother, make of me such a Sahaja Yogi that I can bring hundred Sahaja Yogis to you." Like that you should ask. You should live in the present and not in the future. That is what it is.

Many people ask now: "What is going to happen to our God's Realisation? What is going to happen to this? When are we going to have this power?" Now, this is a wrong attitude. In the present we have  to live and together we have to move. And all of us have to know one thing that we have to just spread Sahaja Yoga. Nothing else  but to spread Sahaja Yoga and we have to keep our personality alright, intact and not [UNCLEAR Nirakar?]. We have to work very hard for that and we have to go out to all kinds of things, think about it: what we can do, how we can spread Sahaja Yoga? All these things should be done.

And we should not be lost because there are lots of temptations in Sahaja Yoga. The first temptation that is is money. You might get money, you might get jobs. You will get married, you will have children. Then you will say: "Alright, I will have my little house, live here..." Finished. You are gone forever.

So, all these things should be attended too and you must see to it that you keep your personality alright, your nationality alright, your clothes alright, everything alright. But your personality must merge with the collective otherwise there will be a big problem. And I respect all the people who keep their personality, keep their nationality, keep the way they are.

Actually these days the situation is such that fashion starts so people start cutting their hair, fashion starts, they start making their hair funny. So, in the fashion you cannot even make out which personality one person is. It is better to dress up in you own personality, in your own country way, the way you are. And it is very beautiful to see diversity in that way creating a beautiful unity among us.

The personality, as it is, keep it. It's nice. I am happy he has shown you there are certain personalities and all that, and when you see them you enjoy them and everybody is enjoying their laughing at themselves. It is a very big thing that you can laugh at yourself and appreciate it. It is a sign of real wisdom.

Now, the last of all I have to say that, on the whole some of you are singing beautiful songs. Together you can sing very well and some of you are taking part into that music. But I would suggest that next time when we go to Ganapatipule let us have a proper book or something like that where all these songs are properly written down. And it should be printed in a proper way so that everybody, even indians, can sing with you. See they should have a chance to sing with you but they cannot read this roman stuff, so if you can give Me, I would like to write it down in Hindi language so everybody can read in India. I mean I cannot read roman - very difficult for Me. And this will help them to sing together.

Singing is one way we are very collective: eating together, living together, sleeping together is all very collective and the individuality, and the different personalities that we see is very beautiful.

On a Diwali day we have to understand that we are all lights on the path the ascent of many people. We all should keep our light afloat, enjoyable, laughing at ourselves, making fun of each other, sometimes pulling legs is alright, but in no way, in no way it should be hurting another personality, means to say something on the physical side of it. Specially one should not remark like somebody is a lame person or a blind person, you should never make fun of such a thing. Otherwise the [UNCLEAR word] and behaviour is very important to see and will be very much appreciated.

Actually I had never known so many foreigners - as I call them - they are now My children. And when I go to different countries I see different-different styles and different-different ways of their food, their - every habit is different. I really enjoy the way people eat differently and talk differently. It's very nice, but in all that one has to see the beauty: how God has created so many human beings, so many faces, by little-little small little cells how he has changed the faces of people. Then every country has a different type of a face. Then every - even a part of the country may have a different type of a face. So, all this is done just to create beauty and love, to show that even if we are all outside different inside we are one.

Animals are - all of them are - I mean there is not much of a difference. Unless and until you are very particular you cannot find out one animal from another animal. If they live with human beings of course it is different, but otherwise if you go in the jungle you cannot make out one tiger, one to another. It is all just the same, they look the same. But this differentiation has come in human beings. And in Sahaja Yoga when you grow more the outside differences could be even more interesting, could be much more interesting.

But the one sign I know about Sahaja Yogis is that their faces glow. Faces glow, eyes have - a beautiful twinkling in the eyes and they are all, all the time enjoying. That is what it is we have to celebrate our own joy, our own virtue, our own righteousness and all our styles.

May God bless you.

So the last song is left out, you sing it now so we go. Come along. Now everybody is watching you and they'll copy you, alright? Be careful.

[Song: Adi Maa]

Shri Mataji: If you want to sing the Bhairavi you can sing it. So we'll go then afterwards.

[song tuning] It's a very difficult song I must say. Tremendous people you are.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much, thank you. All chakras are already opened. What puja are you going to do tomorrow? Alright, so tomorrow puja will be at twelve o'clock. Actually the puja has to be in the night on Diwali but we will have it about twelve o'clock. I hope by that time you will have a nice sleep.

Thank you very much.

[Jaykar] Thank you very much. Good night. Happy Diwali."
