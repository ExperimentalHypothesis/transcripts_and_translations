Talk to Sahaja Yogis

"Please cure this person’s cancer. Please cure this in my sister." But why should this be done? Your Mother has to go ask people for assistance. The so-called rich people come asking for cure for sister, mother, etc. But when it comes to donating money, they are not forthcoming. This is not right. I am telling you I will blacklist such big people. I can tell the names of such people.

(Marathi Talk.)
Please sit child. Write your name. Take a receipt too. Money will not be misused here. We do not need your money personally, this money will be used to buy some land and make a meditation hall. This will be done before I leave. None needs your money for their personal use here. Everyone should take receipt. Similarly make it a point to pay for the photo. Whatever the fixed little price is being asked, pay it. You needn’t pay more. Pay the price that is set. No one should tamper with this money. All Sahaja Yogis should know that money should never be misused or tampered with. This is public money. Each and every penny of public money is equivalent to my blood drop. So beware of misusing money. You shouldn’t mess around with even 1 penny. Dharma [Righteousness] does not mean words. And actions are out of synchronisation. You should have utmost purity when it comes to money. Public money needs to be used for public work. No reason to use it anywhere else. If it comes to me, I do not need any money from you. You cannot give me anything.
All of you please sit with your hands like this. In 15-20 min I will tell you about the other side like I told you about Hatha Yoga yesterday, how Hatha Yoga raised questions in people and how people internally become dry.
Now another side of ours is today’s system. When Sahaja Yoga awakens in this system, when you start receiving vibrations, then from there only all grace enters into you. This Power is All Pervading, All Existing, that Power awakens within you and there is a space between your ego and superego. Now watch both. Now lot of people think that badha [problems] means bad thing and mother is saying something bad. That is not right. You hold badhas dearly all the time. All the time these affect you. Your Agnya Chakra is open. Badhas can enter into you. Badhas can also enter you via your Nabhi Chakra through food/drink. It can go into you in any way. You can only cleanse it. You can also observe your catches. Your kundalini recedes from you.
Tomorrow I will tell you what Sahaja Yoga is and how it happens, how it manifests, what are the advantages. I will speak tomorrow about these.
Now yesterday we did not progress much in dhyan [meditation]. So go back into meditation and watch over each other how you are progressing. You needn’t come on to my feet. There will be no advantage of coming to my feet. Everyone be seated wherever you are. Today I need to go back early. I will seat in in meditation and go. Please don’t touch my feet today. Try going deeper in your meditation. Be peaceful. That is the only way to achieve. Not without getting it.
