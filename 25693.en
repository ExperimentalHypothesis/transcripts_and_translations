Public Program Day 3, Geneva, Switzerland, 31.08.1983

 I Bow to all the seekers of Truth! 

Within us lies the truth, it is said in all the scriptures, where does it lie? Nobody has told so far exactly where it lies. You must have realized from Armour’s lecture that he is Swiss, and he has become such an expert on Kundalini Yoga. There are many young people, very young, who come to Sahaja Yoga, and within a month, they can speak on truth. It is the actualization of the truth that is important. It is the becoming that is important. It is not reading or knowing it from outside, but becoming one with the truth. Whatever we can see outside, is outside us, but when we become that it acts. It shows its power. But so far in the human endeavor, there is nothing that can really give analogy of actualization. For example, somebody becomes the president, still he can lose his job. He may manifest his powers which are bestowed upon him, but he may be wrong. He may make mistakes. He may do exactly what he is not supposed to do. He would not know absolute truth. But when you become the spirit, actualization takes place. As I told you the other day, it is not branding yourself that you are twice born, that you are a realized soul, that you are a very religious person or a righteous person, but you become. It is the becoming. For example, if you say this is a flower, and this has to become the fruit. And the flower, we say is the fruit. And accept it as a truth, though it is a myth. We can continue in that myth, we can sell in the market, because we have advertising capacity. But it won’t have the capacity of the fruit. So you have to become the fruit, so that you can manifest yourself, the powers of a fruit. Now let us see, what are the powers of different levels of Kundalini awakening within us? Though the modern Sahaja Yoga is such a wonderful force, that at the first instant only, a thread like or you can say, a hair like part of the Kundalini raises. Kundalini, you can say is like a rope, with many thin threads in it and tries to pierce through the small hole here (showing on top of head), to create a hole here in the head. If the person is not complicated, if his “Chakras” are open, then it raises with a great force and you see the cool breeze coming out. Sometimes people feel a torrential rain of bliss coming. But it is in actual experience. So, first when the Kundalini raises, opens, awakes we can say or sprouts, it enters into the second Chakra or whether it is second Chakra, I mean the “Nabhi” Chakra. But the first center doesn’t, it’s not to be pierced through, because it lies lower than the Kundalini itself.

Now the first Chakra is the one, which manifests outside, the Pelvic plexus, which doctors know of. And this plexus looks after the excretory system of human beings. Even the sex is looked after by this particular center. Now, one must understand that Kundalini does not pierce through the first chakra. So the sex does not play any part, in the ascending Kundalini. Those people who preach that through sex you can reach God, are doing anti-God activities. One must know that if you indulge too much into sex, and perverted sex, you develop deceases. Those people who are also austere type, who lead an unnatural life, also become very dry, and impossible to be understood by anyone, as they have no emotion being left in them. So one has to be in the center of their innocence. Once you have maintained that innocence, it is very easy to raise the Kundalni. There is a big force of the Kundalini raising in a person, who has lead an innocent married life. But unfortunately, in the west especially, many writers like Freud, we should say philosophers have done such harm to people. That the result of that today we are seeing in the deceases of such nature like AIDS. In Sahaja Yoga, automatically, once the Kundalini raises, you start becoming a very balanced personality. You don’t run after the joyless pursuits. That you lead a very sane sexual life. As a result of this nonsensical theory, today we find, so many marriages broken, so many divorces, so many children stranded, so many people hurt in their heart. Due to this satanic attack on human innocence, human beings have accepted such absurd ideas, that they think they have to now become a sex point. Instead of becoming a human being which is an epitome of a complete creation, the one who is the rightful owner of God’s kingdom, the one who has to lead an eternal life, the one who has to enjoy the blissful benediction of his father. Today in this society, we find people who are wasting their life, ruining their families, ruining their children. Women fighting with men, men fighting with women, it’s horrible. So one has to understand that once the Kundalini gets awakened, a person automatically starts gearing up to the natural forces of the divinity. If both the partners are realized souls, the relationship is so deep, that even if they may not, soft of, show off the relationship, inside they had the security of oneness. The absolute enjoyment of romance. Nowadays, Romeo and Juliets are changing according to the hair style one has. You see, people going on an escalator for a divorce, and showing off their love by kissing each other and if you ask them “where are you going?” they are going to the divorce case. Is this any development, where everyone is insecure? Where every child faces the catastrophe which fall upon him one day? Without realization, it is impossible now, at this stage where the society is at its disastrous point, to understand the value of the companionship.

So the first thing that happens to a person is that he develops a sane attitude towards sex and towards his partner. Of course, you don’t have to run away from sex, but also not to be so much dominated by sex life, that there is nothing else left in your life. Such strengthening boundaries are created that you enjoy all that strength within yourself. You never hurt another person. You always make the other person really joyous. You see the good points of another person and you have such tremendous capacity of wisdom and poise, that the whole system changes. And the married life becomes a beautiful dream. There is a very great writer in England called Barbara Cartland, and they took her interview. She is a very religious woman, a very nice person, a realized soul. And she is the most popular, her books sell like hot cakes all over the world. And they ask her, how is it you manage that. So she said, every man and woman, in their hearts of hearts, want to lead a very happy, joyous, romantic life. But the key to that is complete fidelity and loyalty and enjoyment of married life. And she goes further to say that if you can produce such ideal romantic couples, people like to see their imagination reflected. But that can be seen when you really get your realization, automatically, you don’t have to read her. Secondly your innocence is awakened within you, which grows gradually. And you enjoy your innocence. You enjoy your virtues. Sometimes we are very cunning, we are deceiving ourselves. Specially, the intelligence as a capacity to cheat itself. But you develop that pure intelligence which is called as wisdom. But the manifestation of that is very great. A society of such people is so pure. The relationship of husband wife are only private relationships, but with others they are pure, absolutely pure relations. There are no complications. The life is so simple. There are no emotional problems. There are no sex problems. There are no problems about children. You get very beautiful realized souls as your children. Very healthy, very wise, and extremely joy giving. They don’t cry too much, they don’t trouble you too much, but they are all the time thinking how to respect their parents and how to give them joy. There are thousands and thousands in this country I know, who are born realized children. I see them in the market, I see them on the road, I see them in the restaurants. But the parents don’t understand them at all. Because they are born at a higher level than their parents. They are special people taken birth. To do the great work of God. And unless and until, the parents are realized souls, they will be always the hindrance to the children’s growth. Now from the second chakra, that is the “Swadhishtana” but actually it comes out of the “Nabhi” chakra, so in series it is the third chakra. And it plays and goes round and round, the place called “Void”. It is the centre of our creativity. After coming to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen people, who have been ordinary artists, have become world known artists. We have one artist very well known in India, but he was a drunkard, he became a drunkard. And he could not, because Indian music is such a subtle music, that he could not sing anymore. But after coming to realization, he just gave up his drinking habit, automatically. He started looking much younger. Now he sings, much better than what he was singing. I know of a gentleman, who had no job. And he told me “what should I do for job?” I told me now you are a realized soul, you can do whatever you like! I told him, “Why don’t you try interior decoration”. He got a shock of his life, “I never done anything like that!” He wouldn’t know one wood to another wood, he said “I am not a carpenter, how am I to do this work?” I said, you get carpenters alright, but you should only know what colours to use where, what wood to use where. And overnight he became an interior decorator! Within one year, he was a rich man, having a big house and a car and everything. Now he has gone to America to help me there with the Sahaja Yoga.

There is a farmer today here from India. He had land, but he was never successful as a farmer. And he never thought, he could be an ideal farmer one day. After his realization, one day I was going near a village, I took a turn because there was some problem in the road. And I saw a very beautiful field of a kind of a maze we get in India. And I have never seen such a colour of a maze, the way it was. I was surprised, I said, whose field is this one? And they said, this belongs to this gentleman. So I asked the gentleman, “What did you do to get such a nice crop?” He said, “Mother, nothing! I put some vibrated water in my well, that’s all!” Then I have met some scientists from the agricultural university, who were practising Sahaja Yoga. And they were surprised at the different things they have discovered out of Sahaja Yoga. They found out that if you give vibrated water to drink to an Indian cow, if she is giving 6 litres of milk, she starts giving at least 14 litres! And if it is an Australian cow, imagine! She gives say, may be 16 litres. But in India, we have found out that if Indian kids drink Australian cow’s milk, then they start misbehaving towards parents. When they take Australian cow’s milk, means they misbehave towards parents, they become very turbulent. No, no, the Australian milk if you take, the children become very turbulent, you see it is not like Indian cows! And it is true also, if you see the cows in London, our England! My granddaughter, once said that why the buffalos here are so white? There is not that sweetness of an Indian cow. So whatever it is, the same cow which was giving so little milk, starts giving so much milk. And good nourishing milk. Then he told me so many things that one lecture won’t be sufficient to tell you the whole thing. But the scientists told me that if you have a wheat produced by vibrated water, it is at least four times more! But when you put it in the store room, then even the rats do not touch it! And if you see the shape of the wheat, it is so beautiful, and the colour is so nice that one can’t believe, that without any manure, without any artificiality, how one could produce such good wheat! And the taste of that bread is so good that I felt I have never eaten such food! It is so fantastic to believe. For people who have not gone through Sahaja Yoga, they can’t believe that it is such a fantastic thing that happens! That for the first time, we start giving back to the nature! And nourishing the nature. So far we have always exhausted it. But you must know that the vibrations that are flowing through you, are the vibrations of the “Brahma Shakti”, the power of the God’s love! We say the God is Almighty! He is all compassion! But we have no idea of His supremacy that he is the supreme Master of it! The way He works out everything, after realization, has to be something fantastic. With the third centre, when it awakens, or we can call it as the second centre of Nabhi, one is a satisfied soul. The amount of time we are wasting our time, in choosing the food we eat, what food I have to take, what should I eat today, especially the French! I know when they sit on the table, they take at least half-an-hour to discuss what they will have! What is there so much to decide I don’t know! And  such a waste of time. For example, a gentleman orders say for a fish, and another fellow, the one who supply the food brought not a fish, but could be a lamb! And the fellow got angry, he started shouting at him. He said, I asked for a fish, why did you give me the lamb? So the fellow took away the plate and brought it back again. And this gentleman ate all that lamb, thinking it was a fish! But if he had known that it was not a fish, he would have killed the fellow! How much important is this tongue for us? Such greed is really killing! But when you get your realization, you are a satisfied soul! Indians are the worst in this! I tell them only your tongues are developed! When they travel, they don’t like French, English, American, any food! Actually, when they go to somebody’s house, they have their food first and then go. There is no satisfaction, because you are eating that food every day, still there is no satisfaction. You become a satisfied soul, as per as your appetite is concerned. You don’t fuss, neither you hanker! Actually you never think of food, I think! So many times, I forget, if I have taken my food or not!

Now with this kind of an attitude towards food, you develop the same attitude towards the money and comfort. Like you do not hanker after something like you must have a very comfortable bed. First day when I came to Switzerland, I went as a guest to a very fuzzy lady, I must say, and she offered me very kindly her bed. And the bed, she said, had buttons by which you can raise the lower part, upper part, centre part! Every part can be raised! I am very old, but I am not involute! That I should have a button to raise my hand and raise my legs! I bow to her bed and to her hospitality, and I slept on the ground! It is so complicate! Suddenly you find your hands and legs going up! It’s too much for me! So that’s how, you see these comforts sits on our head. This matter is always fighting the spirit. It really enslaves us! Like those who are sitting on the chair, can’t sit on the ground. Those who sleep on the bed, cannot sleep on the ordinary wood. How we become slave to this is so surprising, the way people will be carrying their beds with them, in their cars I think one day! Comfort is the slavery of this matter. But the style, another extreme is also not good. Like these days, the modern food style that has started. In England, we have natural food stores. And I had first six hippies to my lot to work on them. They were my first disciples. And they invited me to the lunch. And they have bread, which my teeth could not break, I don’t know if buffalo could eat it! It was like a stone. Then they eat lot of roughage to eat. I don’t know what sort. Roughage, all kinds of garbage, I don’t know what! But they said, this is natural! I said, may be natural for animals, but not for human beings!  But I didn’t want to hurt them. I ate that food, with great difficulty. But the second day, I had such pain in the stomach. I have never been to a dentist, but my gums have swollen like this! And I am never sick in the bed, but I wouldn’t get up from the bed! My husband was there, he got such a shock that he said, what’s the matter with you? Did they give you some drugs? I said, no they gave me natural food! So this is going another limit. One should know, what one has to eat for a particular kind of a body you have. There is no general rule for anything. Like, someone wants to now diet, so everybody diets! Whether it suits you or doesn’t matter! But I can’t understand why this madness! The whole concept is so funny! And it is sapping the energy of women so much, that I think men have really be-fooled women! That they made the women really suffer so much. So these mundane things like food and comfort and nonsensical things are of no value to us. Lose their value. But if a realized person cooks the food, and somebody eats that food, if the person has any stomach trouble, he gets cured! Some people have very nervous intestine, nervous stomach, all these people have been cured by such methods. So a kind of a very deep satisfaction one enjoys.

I have to go for so many chakras, so I will go rather fast now. The Nabhi chakra around is the, whole thing if you see around is the “void”. Here resides our sustenance. Sustenance is our valence, as Hydrogen has a valence and Carbon has four valences, in the same way, human beings have ten valences. These in very strict words, are the Ten Commandments. When one tries to cross them, this way or that way, they develop the problems of the stomach. Now in this area, resides the attention. I mean our attention on the food first of all! Then from food it moves to money. Then to power. And then to God. Those people whose attention has gone to God, are the seekers, who are truthful seekers. They do not get satisfied with the falsehood. But they go one seeking till they find the truth. But even then I have seen people who have been seekers, have become “Guru” shopping habited people. You must have seen the picture of Charlie Chaplin, Modern Times, where he is fixing up the belt with his hand, and after now the belt is stopped and he is free to move out, he is still going on like that! So the Guru shopping still goes on with some people, they do not settle down. If you have to dig the well, you must see where the water you find. So, people go on digging here, digging there, digging there, but where you find a drop of water, go deep down there, that’s wisdom! Shallow people cannot come up very much. You have to have deep understanding. Now, when this centre is illuming, around it is illuming your sustenance. That’s your inner religion. We call it as ten incarnations of the Primordial Master. There are many who came, but ones who came in India are called “Dattatreya”, “Raja Janaka”, the father of Sita. In China, Lao-tse, Confucius. In the Bible, Abraham and Moses. And later on, in the form of “Mohammad Sahib”. And then Janka, no no Nanaka. Nanak Sahb. And in Greece, it was Socrates. They took birth in all these places. In the end, about fifty years back, or 100 years back, was born a great Primordial Master, in India, in Shiridi.

So now, we are now at the point of a higher centre, which is called as Heart Centre. This has got two sides, right and left. Right one is for the father and the left one is for the mother. The right one if it is caught up, if the fatherhood is missing, if the father had died early, or if you are not a good father, or if you didn’t have a good father. Or if you miss your father, anything like that can give you an asthma. If your father is dead, also it can happen. And if you get asthma, it can be cured very easily, if you can awaken the fatherhood in yourself. And on the left side is the mother’s. Now when this centre, when something wrong with your mother, if your mother is not a good mother, or if your mother died early, or if you had a step mother, or you are not a good mother, anyone of these, such a person is very nervous, he doesn’t trust anyone, and also he might be very much frightened personality. So you can understand, how motherhood is important. The centre of this, is adored by the Mother of this world, we call it the “Jagadamba”, the Mother of the Universe. She looks after you till, when you are about 12 years of age, she generates through her power in the, what is it called septum here, a kind of cells, which are called as anti-bodies. Sternum bone. And they spread out in the whole body. And if there is any attack on the body, these soldiers of the Mother, fight. They get the message by the movement of this bone here. If you get frightened, the palpitation sets in motion in this bone. And they attack with a greater force, to protect the body and the mind. And now if this centre is disturbed in a woman, if her motherhood is challenged, if the husband is a flirt, he deceives his wife, the best part of it, all such people whom I have met, they say that we are guilty, we don’t want to hurt our wives, but we can’t help it. I tell them that this is the escape of the ego. You are hurting your wife, because you like it. And you are a cruel man. If you are guilty, you should take some punishment upon yourself. You have no business to hurt your wife, who is a dedicated and a good wife. God will never forgive such a man. Even if you go and confess in the church it does not matter.  It is God, Almighty who sees everything. But these women, themselves suffer. Such women develop the trouble of the breast, especially, the cancer of the breast. It is always caused by the insecurity of the wife. In America, it’s a very common decease. Though the women there try to be like men, but they are sensitive and delicate things. They end up with such deceases.

Now we come to the other centre of “Vishuddhi” chakra, which is the most important, in the sense that it acts as all your evolution as far as human life is concerned. This has got 16 petals. Outside in the gross it manifests, the cervical plexus, and controls your ear, nose, throat, muscles in your eyes and your face. Also it controls the first bone, and all the bones that go up to the cranial bones. So it is the centre of your responsibility. By which you feel responsibility. Also it creates two institutions within you, as ego and superego, which crossover at this point (showing Agnya). The right one passes like this, and crosses over and covers all this area in front (showing left side of the head). And the other one crosses over from the left side and covers this area (showing right side of the head). So you have these two things described in the Chinese style of Lao-tse’s say in religion. These are the two institutions of “Ha” and “Tha”. Two sympathetic nervous systems. One creating ego and another creating superego as a by-product. When the Kundalini passes through this centre (showing Vishuddhi), you develop a soft beautiful voice. A melodious voice. I know of many Sahaja Yogis, who never used to sing, they are all horribly discarded, after realization, they started singing beautifully like a nightingale.  Also you develop a vocabulary, which is very gentle and kindly. You no more bark like a dog and bray like a donkey, but you talk like a good human being, in a very sweet and kindly way. Not trying to find, some way of hurting others, but some way of soothing others, giving joy. Apart from that this centre has tremendous capacities, because the hands are connected with it. So you start feeling the cool breeze, if your centre (showing Vishuddhi) is good. So many people feel the fresh air coming out of the head, but not in the hands, because they smoke, if they have a dominating voice then the right side catches. If they feel guilty then the left side catches. And that is how, the Kundalini cannot move. But with the awakening of this centre, you get the power to heal others. You have a power to soothe others. Your hands become absolutely soft. Your face gets a very, what you say, clear glow, brilliant glow. You don’t have to use artificial things to paint yourself. You can save lot of money on that. So, this is what happens to you automatically. This is in short I am telling you. But when this centre is awaken, the greater centre representing here (showing Agnya) because all these centres are represented again, in a bigger way in the brain. So this centre (showing Agnya) when this is awaken which is a larger centre of this (showing Vishuddhi), you become collectively conscious. This (showing Vishuddhi) is the centre of collectivity. But the best of all is when this centre is awakened, you think, the whole thing is a big drama. Before realization, you are watching everything and you are thinking that you are acting and you are in it. Not only acting, but you are Nepolean in the play, and then the drama is over you know that I was just watching this, I was a witness. That’s what happens exactly, that you start seeing that as a drama from the outside. You are not involved into it. And you are not involved, you can solve problems better. If you have to repair your car, you have to get out of it.

Then the above centre (showing Agnya) above is the very important centre of Agnya chakra. It is placed in the optic chiasma, where they are crossing each other. Which these Buddhists call it as the Third Eye. Horrible things these are. Some man cut this and put an artificial eye. At this centre is bestowed by the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now it is a very great incarnation. He came on this earth for one thing. To prove that the spirit never dies. Message of his life is resurrection, not his crucifixion. His crucifixion was his work, to suffer for us and to cross through that tight cross, to be reborn, as the spirit. He was the spirit. He didn’t have a human body. He was in a body of the spirit. That’s why he could walk on the water. All other incarnations have the body from the mother earth. But he was born of the spirit, he was the spirit. And that’s why he could achieve this. And he has said that, at the time of Holy Ghost, will be born of your spirit, by the spirit. It’s very interesting, the way he has expressed himself.  And when he has resurrected himself, he has created a personality within us, which if we awaken, we can also crossover. So this is the door, through which everyone has to pass. But that doesn’t mean that you can pass through this door by going to a church. Or by reading Bible. Or by saying Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ. Your Kundalini has to pass through that centre. That is the door he has described. And he didn’t say he is the destination, though he is in a way, because when you enter into the realm of formless. Into the realm of the limbic area, which is the kingdom of God. Or we can say that where we are dressed to go into the subtler consciousness, by piercing through this area (showing top of the head) like a reception hall.  Then when this centre (showing Sahastrara) opens out through Sahaja Yoga, you become aware of the subtle energy around you. You really become the realized soul. You become a real Sufi. Or a Peer. Or in Indian Language they are called as “Dwijaha”, means born again. Even a bird is called Dwijaha. Because, like an egg it comes on to this earth, because human beings are like an egg. It grows inside like a bird and then the mother hand like the Holy Ghost pierces this. And you come out as the bird, transformed. Absolutely free! But you have to learn how to fly. Many people who feel the cool breeze, then forget about it. Next year I come, they say, “Mother I developed this trouble, that trouble”. Which is like a bird, which is newly born and doesn’t know how to fly, tries to do wrong things. But you must learn. It is very easy. Hardly in a month’s time you can become an expert. Not much time needed. Once a week at the most. And five six things you become, must, and this is what you must all realize. (Noise from the audience) Now will you please stop sir! (More noise) Go what are you doing? Please sit down, have you come to listen to me or not. Please sit down. You write down your question. Sit down. Be sensible. Nobody has come to listen to you. No, don’t do like that. Nobody has come to listen to you Mr. We can do later. Later! Later we do, please sit down. Please sit down, don’t disturb. He is like a jack in the box. No,no, no. What have you done so far? Nothing? What have you done so far? Have you given any realization to anyone? Have you given any comfort to anyone? Why do you talk? You don’t know anything, you are a child. Try to listen, this is knowledge. And knowledge should be understood through knowledge. He is disturbing everyone, he is very unkind man. He is no compassion. Please sit down. You can’t help them. Yesterday, I cured a lady, who was about 70 year old, was suffering from a decease incurable, can you do it? Then don’t talk, sit down.  You can’t do anything. Or you better go. He must go, this is not proper. (Noise) I know you people. It’s alright. You see these are the people who belong to a group called “Twice Born”. They are very hot tempered people. They are not worried about their realization. They haven’t got the intelligence to understand that they are achieving nothing. Very strong headed people. This fat lady, last time brought a Bible to beat me. They come in a group. Extremely funny people, they are the ones, who call themselves “Twice Born”, these are the people who crucified Christ. (Noise). Just look at that. Alright, sit down. Oh, this is another group, I must tell you about this man, close the door, I will tell you about this one. They’ll all end up with a heart attack, that’s all. This fellow, Sai Baba, there is one fellow there. I can understand, Indians impressed by them. But he takes out diamonds, you see and gives it to people. Not to poor, to rich! And he takes so much from the rich there. One gentleman who is called Mr. Sircar, who is very good, well known Juggler in India. What you call Juggler, a magician. He went and told him, alright show me all your tricks. So he took out some ashes. So this juggler took the ashes and brought out a living pigeon! Moreover there is a horrible book written about this man, I don’t remember the name of the book, but he is a homo sexual. I don’t understand, people from the affluent country run after such a man! The best part of it, that all his people who have come to me, had severe heart attacks. So many industrialists have died at the age of 40 years, who have been following him. But he impresses stupid people. Even some of our governors are mad after him. And this governor got heart attack thrice. And then he came to me. And his wife was so possessed by this man. And the governor said that he is losing lot of diamonds from his house. He said that “I am losing diamonds from my house”. So I asked his wife who was a doctor, I said, what happened to the diamonds. She got afraid. She said, “I have given to this Babaji!” I said why? But somebody in me, always says that these diamonds are dust, are only stones. So give them away to Babaji. I said, you are a married woman, coming from a respectable family. And in India, all married woman has to wear all the ornaments according to the status of the husband. So if this is your life style, because, you are a married woman, it is quite alright. Only thing, if you get your realization, you just get it dashed about it. You become absolutely generous about it. Now, this lady told me that, this gentleman doesn’t tell, but somebody else tells her in her own mind. I told her, you are a lady doctor. Now think it over, you are a house wife of a governor. First lady. And why should you give a diamond to this fellow, who is a Sanyasi, an ascetic. If it is a stone to you, that it is a dust to him. But if you go and see his place, the way he has built it, on the money of others. He studded with all these, but the aesthetics are horrible. And this fellow is sitting down there, and doing all these tricks. We have many like these! Now understand that, God is not there to give you these diamonds. If God has to give something, he will give you in such a way that you will know His’ blissful nature. His work is to give you realization. He has no interest in things like diamonds, what does it matter? It is equal to the dust of his feet! So you be careful about such people. There are other a group called “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna”, they are set of beggars! They come to India and really pasture villagers in India, you see they are begging everywhere. And these are the people they came to my house, and said that you are regarded as the greatest saint of India, how is it you live so well? I said, because, I am not attached to anything. I said, you can take away anything from this house. But should be equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna’s feet. They started looking at everything. I said, what have you given up? The stones? If you are not holding on to anything, what are you going to give up? I think, matter has only one value that you can express your joy of giving through them, like presents. These people form groups for money sake. But it is more than that. Because they will spoil your Kundalini. They spoil your chances of realization. They give you deceases, heart attacks, they give you epilepsy, all sorts of deceases. Most of the cases of the cancer that I have cured, I have cured the cancer of our president, Sanjiva Reddy. And he has given us a land for free in Delhi, to run the Sahaja Yoga Centre. I have noticed that those people who suffer from cancers, all of them have some infection from the left side, means something like this Guru business, or maybe they have gone to some dead art, or some sort of a thing like that. Or people who go to the cemeteries, also churches have got cemeteries. So this is what they do, and here their disciples I know, within five years you see, all of them will be down with heart. You better write down their names to find out where are they. Be careful! God’s work is not human work. His interests are not human. His only one interest is to give you realization. To make you enter into the kingdom of God. Nothing else. And that’s what you should ask for. If you want diamonds, you can go to Sai Baba, I have nothing to say, I cannot give. Shirdi Sai Nath was the real incarnation. But this fellow is an imposter. And that’s why he calls himself the True Sai baba. If it is true, why should you say true, do you say, true Jesus Lord? But what to do with stupidity of people? I must say that today it has been a long time, I have been talking to you. Yesterday, I have given lot of time to you, meeting you all. But today, I will have to leave, because tomorrow early morning, I have to go somewhere else. It’s a very marathon race I have to do! But it works out. So, I would request all of you, whether, you have got realization or not realization, logically, I am trying to bring to a point to realize, that you have to actualize the experience of the spirit. You are actually to be born again and you should be baptised in the true sense of the word. To manifest your own powers. Now luckily this hall is available, when is it available? Please tell. Please make it convenient, (days, and time announced). Now you people should come, establish your realization, it is the most important thing you have to do. This will save the world. It will save you. And it will give meaning to the whole creation. This is all predicted. It is predicted, thousands of years back in India, up to the exact time that it will start in 1970, and I started Sahaja Yoga in 1970. William Blake, a great poet, hundred years back, described so much in detail, to such an extent that he gave an exact position of houses where I will be living in London. And also the exact position, area of the ashram we will have. Gene Nixon, who was a great, regarded as a great sort of a horoscope lady, she had predicted that I will be born on such and such year.  In the Bible also, there is a prediction about the resurrection time, in the Quran there is, and of course in all the Indian scriptures. Also it was described that great seekers will be born in very great numbers, and they will receive their self-realization. Thank you very much! Now I hope to see you again next year. I am now going to Austria, and then to Rome, and then to America. Please pray that we get more people who want realization, who are truthful people, honest people and are concerned about the wellbeing of themselves and of the whole world. Thank you very much!
