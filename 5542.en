Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Rahuri (India)
Talk Language: Marathi | Translation (Marathi to English) - VERIFIED

It is very difficult to describe. This is something important and profound that deserves our attention. I have incarnated and come to this Earth many times to work for humanity, but only in this life have human beings recognized me. It is the punya (past good karma) of the people of Rāhuri that this work is happening here, and that you have recognized me.

Rāma, Shri Krishna, and many saints incarnated and came to this world, but people gave them a hard time. When the Devi (Divine Mother) incarnated, the Rākshasās (demonic forces) attacked her. She fought all of them and brought peace to humanity.

At that time, some bhaktās (devotees) of God performed havans (sacred fire rituals) to establish God's kingdom on Earth. But the Rākshasās tried to destroy these sacred fires, stop the rituals, and even tortured the devotees. Some of these demonic forces were so evil that their negativity could be felt across the whole Earth. To protect humanity, the Devi incarnated and took birth to destroy those Rākshasās.

Just like a tree grows from its roots to trunk, branches, and then to leaves and fruits, the protection of humanity through divine incarnations has evolved over time. Now, in this era of Kaliyuga—the current age of conflict and decline in righteousness—the time has come for the tree to bear fruit. The youth, or Yuva Shakti, are the flowers and fruits of this divine tree.

India, and especially Maharashtra, is a land of punya (spiritual merit), where many tapasvis (ascetics) and sādhus (holy men) have done deep spiritual practices (tapasyā). It is the birthplace of many great saints. On this land of Maharashtra are the Ashtavināyaka—the eight self-manifested (svayambhu) idols of Lord Ganeshā—which emerged from the Mother Earth herself. These places are filled with divine vibrations created by the Earth.

Rāhuri is located in the very center of Mahārāshtra. Any significant work must begin from the center and then spread outward. That is why this spiritual work is starting in Rāhuri. You are very fortunate to be born in Maharashtra. It is your responsibility to spread this love and light throughout the world.

In the past, people were afraid and could not speak the truth openly. Even Shri Krishna faced great suffering, as did Christ and Prophet Muhammad, who was poisoned. In Sahaja Yoga, we can verify through vibrations that Prophet Muhammad was an incarnation of the Ādi Guru Dattātreya. The last incarnation of this divine teacher was Shri Sai Nāth of Shirdi. What a great work he did—even though he was born into a Muslim family, people recognized his divinity.

Guru Nanak Sahib, too, was an incarnation of the Ādi Guru. Maharashtra is also the land of Saint Chōkhāmelā, who was born into a lower caste but was still recognized as a great saint. The people of Maharashtra still carry the spirit of dharma—true, pure religion.

In India, especially in Maharashtra, people are not Dharmāndh - prejudiced in the name of religion. They recognize true saints and sages, regardless of which religion they come from. In Maharashtra, people are wise; they respect all religions equally.

Guru Nanak Sahib did great work in the field of spirituality. He himself was believed to be an incarnation of Lord Dattātreya. Guru Nanak even included the Abhangs (devotional poetry) of Saint Nāmdev in the Guru Granth Sāhib. But sadly, nowadays, some Sikhs are losing touch with the real teachings of Guru Nānak. It seems they have lost their humanity — it’s difficult to even have a respectful conversation with them. They focus more on external appearances — fancy clothes, luxury cars, big bungalows — but beyond that, there’s a disconnect with  true values.

In London, many Sikhs claim to be followers of Guru Nānak, yet they are seen heavily drinking. Even the English are surprised by how much they consume. Guru Nanak Sahib never supported drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. Despite that, some are fighting the government over helmet laws for two-wheelers, claiming it's against their religion. They even organized large protests and some went to jail, but the British government stayed firm, stating that law is law — everyone must wear a helmet while riding.

They have forgotten the real essence of Guru Nanak’s teachings and are instead inventing ideas that suit them. Maharashtra, on the other hand, is a land of truly spiritual people. People here understand Dharmā — pure religion. When someone strays from real Dharmā, it leads to Dharmāndhatā — blind faith, which eventually leads to exploitation by false gurus.

Religion must have balance. When taken to extremes, it becomes uncontrollable. That’s when evil people benefit and emerge as so-called spiritual leaders. In this Kaliyugā (dark age), demonic beings (Rākshasās) — who once fought against divine forces — are now taking birth as so-called sadhus and gurus. If you call them Rākshasās, you might be jailed, so they hide behind titles like “spiritual teacher” or “Bhagwān.” Some even dare to teach the Shrimad Bhagavad Gītā, but if you look into their personal lives, you’ll see darkness and corruption.

I visited one such ashram. The Guru sat to eat with a large silver plate and 24 silver bowls, consuming excessive food like a Rākshasā. Surrounded by glamorous attendants, he lived in luxury. Despite his actions, people bowed at his feet and treated him like a god, especially in Pune. This is the war of the Kaliyugā — not a physical war, but a subtle (sūkṣma) war of thoughts and ideas. Such a battle has never been seen before. These fake gurus inject satanic thoughts into people’s minds and erase true spirituality.

But on the brighter side, Sahaja Yoga is enabling people to receive their Self-realization in large numbers and discover the truth about themselves and others. The seed of absolute truth, reality, and greatness is being sown. But just like a flower or fruit that falls to the ground, if it isn’t nurtured properly, it goes to waste. Whether it’s a newly blossomed flower or a freshly ripened fruit, if it’s not used wisely or allowed to grow fully, it’s lost.

New Sahaja Yogis must understand that from all four sides, they are under attack by satanic thoughts, false religions, and fake gurus. If a fruit has just emerged from the flower and falls to the ground before becoming fully ripened (paripakva), it is wasted. In the same way, new Sahaja Yogis must be aware of these negative forces. Like a strong tree rooted deeply in the earth, they must stand firmly in truth and grow spiritually.

Sahaja Yogis must reflect: "Who am I?" After Self-realization, they should understand that they are part of Paramātmā, the Divine Almighty. They are not the mind, intellect, ego, or body. Slowly, as this truth becomes established within, one begins to understand why they were chasing after material things so blindly.

In this world, there is one thread (ek sūtra) that connects us all, like the beads of a garland (mālā). Every human being is a bead strung on this divine thread—connected, not separate. This is the formula of God's creation, and it must be understood.

Imagine standing in the sea. You may fear which wave might drown you. But if someone puts you in a boat, you begin to enjoy the waves, watching them from above. You no longer fear being drowned. Similarly, in Sahaja Yoga, the real question is: who benefits? Is it Shri Mataji? Is it a Sahaja Yogi like Mr. Dhumal? No—the one who benefits the most is you. No one in the world has gained as much as you can through this. This is your own inner knowledge and power (Antarik Sampadā), and Sahaja Yoga gives you the key to unlock it.

In villages, people are innocent (bhōle), but innocence does not mean ignorance or foolishness. People must learn to discern what is true and what is false. For instance, a few days ago, a policeman told me, “My daughter says Devi has entered her. She speaks like you, Shri Mātājī.” I told him, “That’s not possible—it’s a possession.” I asked him to bring her to me. When they did, the poor girl said her head was hurting. I asked, “If Devi is inside you, how can you be in pain?” I asked her, “Who are you?” and she began to hum. I gave her bandhan (a spiritual cleansing), and we discovered it was a case of possession—a psychological problem.

Her family, the Kulkarni’s, thought something divine was happening. But I explained: this was a spirit possession. Such things are real. Science, the Purāṇas, the Quran, and even Christ and Prophet Muhammad have spoken about bhoots (negative spirits or possessions). People who are affected by these spirits often suffer mentally. There’s no shame in this—it’s a fact. One of our Sahaja Yogi psychologists from London can also confirm that such entities do enter the body. Even people in the West are beginning to believe it.

Once you are in Sahaja Yoga, we teach you how to recognize and cure these possessions.

I didn’t want to talk about this initially. Prophet Muhammad himself explained how to deal with such spirits using methods like shoe-beating. For the past three years, I tried to focus only on giving positive energy—awakening the Kundalini and mass Self-realization. But unfortunately, we must also remove the negativity.

Once, a lady in Sahaja Yoga started a business of "clearing bhoots" using a whip (chābuk). When I returned from the U.S., I received a letter and went to investigate. She did puja to my feet, and I saw thousands of people around her with possessions. I asked her, “What is this?” She said, “This is my service to you, Shri Mataji.”

I told her, “Your former guru used to do this kind of thing—bringing ‘kumkum’ from his hand, beating people in the name of cleansing, chanting, giving horse racing numbers and matkā (lotto) numbers. We are here for spiritual ascent, not business.”

I invited her to my home and said, “We are here to attain ‘Paramātmā’. Can you tell me the spiritual condition of these two people sitting here or what they need for awakening?” She couldn’t answer. She said, “You took away my powers.” I replied, “If you truly had power, I would have lifted you on my head and told the whole world how great you are. I am a mother. Every mother wants her child to succeed. But you don’t have the real power of Paramātmā.”

I tried to help her, but her ego got in the way. She returned home and resumed her old business—lotto numbers, horse racing tips, and ghost-clearing. Eventually, she lost her mind and become mad and was admitted to the mental hospital.

The people who are interested only in Parmeswar—God Almighty—are the ones who are sustained and get luck in Sahaja Yoga. People who are interested in God, they will get it and grow faster in Sahaja Yoga.

Now Mr. Chavan, Mr. Mane, and Mr. Dhumal—they are from your place, trying to achieve. I have told you: have an aim, and the things that are not important or interesting for God, leave it.

Now how to recognize it? That’s why I have given you the measure of Chaitanya. With this, you are able to understand. I have given you the power of light in the eyes, so use this Chaitanya power from your palms and decide which things to keep and which things to leave.

Nowadays people go to Kāshi Vishwanāth and bring those mālās—garlands—buy them for a rupee and put them around the neck. What happens? These are like business. What people do in Kashi with women, does anyone know? Then they buy and put those mālās-necklaces on their necks. Bit of foolishness. What happens is, Kāshi Vishweshar has already left from there.

Whatever they bring, if I tell them to remove it, they don’t want to remove it. These things have bhoot on them and they give trouble to the person wearing them. They get problems.

I have also told you: don’t wear black thread. But now, it’s true—black thread belongs to Bhairavā. Not all people can handle the power of Bhairavā. Also, is it real or is there something else in the name of Bhairavā? Bring it here: let’s see if it is really in the name of Bhairavā. Who has it put there?

What happens is, people put it around a child’s neck. And when they bring that child in front of me, the child screams. Reason is: that the black thread has bhoots sitting on it, and that is possession. Then the child suffers.

If you really want to put something, then put red thread. But again—why is it necessary? What happens is, children get mad when you put these kinds of things. I have to keep telling people: don’t put it. What did I get from it? Did I get something and re-sell it? Or do business with it? We throw it away! Then why do you put it on the neck of the child?

I have come here to give you positive thoughts and bring great change in your life. I don’t want anything. I have come to serve you, to bring positivity into your life. Take it and improve your life.

It doesn’t mean that Rama and Krishna are not important. But at that time, those incarnations came for war and to finish off bad things. Now is the time of the Mother: through love, to give this positive power.

There are very negative people who are lost in life. I have told Mr. Dhumal many times to bring them back, since I am a Mother. Where will these people go? I can see their past and future. I want to cure them, to improve them. I don’t want to lose anyone. All the children should grow. That’s because I am the Mother.

People whom I have established who are sitting steadily or have achieved a spiritual stage through Sahaja Yoga meditation, there’s no problem with them. But still, some are moving up and down, here and there. I feel worried for them.

Actually, you are all a part of my body. So when there's pain in a certain part of my body, I recognize there is a problem in that place—or in that Sahaja Yogi. Then I look into how this thing happened to him. My attention goes on him. Why did he do that? – and so on.

The human race is ‘vichitra’—strange. The point here is that God has given complete freedom to humans. Either he can become Godly, saintly, or he can become a Rākshasā (demon), an ‘Ati-Mānav’ (superman), or even a donkey. No limits are given by God. And even God bends His own neck before this human freedom.

We are just helping you learn how to use that freedom wisely: how to grow, how to cross this ocean and reach the shore safely and with joy. That’s what we are trying to do here.

I don’t need anything from you. Just have patience and understanding.

Those who have gone deeper in Sahaja Yoga, there’s no need to tell them anything. For example, once you sit on a boat and it starts swinging with the waves, up and down, that’s a stage that comes in meditation too. At that time, the person needs help—until they settle and are able to have control over that boat. That swing is also important. Otherwise, how will you learn?

Sometimes I feel a little angry or unhappy with you. Everyone wants to come to my feet to touch them. I tell Mr. Dhumal: it’s okay for these people come to my feet, but it’s not always necessary. Some people feel that if they don’t come to my feet, they will lose something.

But ‘saburi’ (patience) is needed. This is a very difficult test of time. If Mother told you not to come to the feet, then you have to listen.

Previously, many people would come at once; put their heads on my feet. Some would pull my feet; some would slam their head onto them. But nowadays, because Mr. Dhumal told them, people come in a line. Otherwise, my feet used to get sore. There are thousands of chakras on the feet. They absorb all your problems into them.

Then some Sahaja Yogis would rub my feet so they could feel better. I told them: ask what you want, and you’ll get it. Sahaja Yogis have my feet on their Sahasrara chakra—on their head—and they feel the cool vibrations coming from there.

Once you’re on this boat, you have to allow it to swing to be tested. But some shallow people get lost even in that small swing.

Sometimes people take things the wrong way when I say something to them. But they don’t see that what I told them is for their own good.

Once you understand that Shri Mataji has come for your ‘kalyān’(your upliftment), once that is established in your mind, then why do you doubt? Why would Shri Mataji tell you wrong things, or say anything bad about you? It’s for your own good.

Sahaja Yoga is pure. And once you come into it, you will become pure too. Some people told me, “These people are bad.” But once they come into Sahaja Yoga, they change in a moment. I’ve seen it happen. I’ve seen the change in people.

Sahaja Yoga is like ‘Nirmala Gangā’—pure like the river Gangā. Then why are you talking about someone’s past? What’s the use of saying how bad someone was before?

There were even some people among us saying wrong things. And then, one small boy got up and said to that man, “What are you saying? How many people have you given self-realisation to? How many lives have you changed? Do you have power or are you just talking?” And that person stopped.

It’s like a ‘bhikhāri’(beggar), saying to the Sun, “You are bad.” what authority does a beggar have?

Open your mouth and speak, but first ask yourself: where is the Sun, and where are you? Do you even have the authority to speak about the Sun?

Some people are unable to get their Self-realisation because of bad karma from their past lives, or because of the kind of life they’ve lived. But that’s not the fault of Sahaja Yoga. This is a ‘Krāntikāri’ time: the time of the Last Judgement.

The next incarnation is coming with ‘11 Rudras’. One Rudra’s power is enough to finish everything and now He’s coming with eleven. There will be a sorting out. At that time, there won’t be any lectures like Shri Mataji gave. You won’t be able to just come and expect help. It won’t work like that anymore.

Yes, this is the scary part. But there’s also the beautiful side: ‘ānandāchi gōst’(the talk of eternal joy). We’re asking you to get connected with God Almighty, to understand through ‘ātmasākshatkār’: Self-realisation, and to achieve that ‘Brahmānand’, the eternal joy within yourself. Then, you’ll enter the kingdom of God.

You can see it yourself.  Children are getting their self-realisation. And if a child cries at the exact moment of this process, it means there is some negativity within. Why else would a child cry right at that moment? That’s a sign of bādhā (obstruction or possession).

Recently, a woman came to me. She was possessed, and she fainted right in front of me. Then someone brought her back again! At least inform me before bringing such people, so I can be prepared and give special attention.

But some people say to me, “You’re a saint. You should take care of everything. Saints are supposed to tolerate all things. Even when people throw stones at saints, they don’t mind.” This has now become a kind of politics.

I say Khabardār!—I warn you, don’t speak lightly about saints or the suffering they go through. If you dare to lift even one hand against a saint, I’ll make sure that hand doesn’t work anymore. Those days are gone.

Then these people ran away from there.

You think saints come here to be tortured by you? That’s your idea? This is the negativity in people. But no matter how much you try to torture, the Absolute Truth will never disappear from this world (‘Samsāra’). That truth blooms through the lives of Sahaja Yogis.

Today in Sahaja Yoga, those who’ve achieved self-realisation should maintain that deep state in their lives. Sahaja Yogis should reach great heights everywhere.

I believe the people of Rāhuri have achieved something special. When I first came to Mumbai, I spoke about holding a program in Rāhuri. People from Rāhuri are great in Maharashtra, and that’s why I took birth in Maharashtra.

Recently I visited UP and Bihar. People there told me how Maharashtrians run cooperatives so well. In contrast, everywhere else—even with the best policies—there is corruption.

So people from UP and Bihar came to see our kārakhānā (our industries), and saw that there’s much less corruption. I told them it’s because in Maharashtra we have the Ashtavinayak (the eight Swayambhu Ganeshās) sitting in this land. That’s why people here still have religion, still stay connected to the truth.

But nowadays, things like Matakā-lotto (a form of gambling in India that cheats the poor) have started spreading. I want to finish this.

I went to Andhra Pradesh (AP), and the farmers there were growing tobacco. They told me, “We don’t use it ourselves, but we export it to foreign countries.” I asked them, “Isn’t that papa (a sin)?” First, I tried to explain Sahaja Yoga to them in a thoughtful way. Then I told them not to grow tobacco, and instead to try wax (cotton) farming. A couple of farmers listened, but most didn’t agree with me.

So I warned them three times—it’s all recorded on tape. I told them:“See here, this Sea is like an incarnation of Dattātreya (the Guru). Be careful. He will consume you if you don’t stop this tobacco farming.” And then, one day, a tsunami came and wiped out their entire tobacco crop. I had told them to switch to wax farming.

Later, I went to Delhi. There I saw many so called ‘pantyā’ (caste brahmins), who had gone to ‘Gokul’ or ‘Vrindavan’. But what they were doing was looting poor people. It felt like they were all followers of ‘Kamsa’, the demon. I was sick of it. The rivers Gangā and Yamunā had to punish them, and eventually, they did—floods came and washed them all away.

I warned everyone: no one should get involved in the game of Matkā-lotto. And if there are any Sahaja Yogis playing it, warn them to stop immediately. I am a loving and soft person, but if someone keeps doing this, I will not be pleased. I can be very firm.

Those who go deep in Sahaja Yoga will experience ānand—a joy that is deep and true in life. I have accepted you. Now, please accept me. I have brought these people out from hell to change. Just look at them. Don’t follow the path of greed and money. Don’t take in those bad influences.

Now, cancer has come, and we are the only ones who can truly cure it, as though it came for us to solve. From now on, worse diseases and terrible things will come. Sahaja Yoga is the only path to save people and to give you ānandāche dohāle (waves of Eternal Joy) in the life.

Come to this path. It is ready for you. Flowers have been offered to you on this road. A blanket of flowers has been laid out for your journey. People all over the world are doing ārati for you. Garlands have been placed on you with love.

The people of Rāhuri were the first to recognize this. I’m very proud. You are doing great in the world. Maybe we are blessed by Shirdi Sai-nāth here.

You are truly lucky from many lifetimes. Recognize that. And I will tell you everything—there is not a single false word in this. It’s all the absolute truth, for your upliftment and growth.

Sometimes I speak strongly, even use a shoe to beat out negativity. Actually, Prophet Mohammed himself said that if there are bhoots (bad spirits), hit them with a shoe to drive them out. Don’t hold it in your heart. Just clear it out.

Lift your life. Grow. Look at these children: don’t they deserve a bright future? They need this. Let ‘Lakshmī’, the goddess of prosperity, and ‘Sarasvatī’, the goddess of knowledge, be established in your lives.

You deserve to live happily, in joy and comfort. Have the desire for it. I have no desire myself. I don’t want anything from you or from anyone. I am only here to give. So ask for it, and you will receive it.

Lady asking a question:
Is Sahaja Yoga yours?

Answer:
Yoga is not mine. It's yours. It belongs to everyone—it comes from ānādi-kālā, the ancient times. It's like asking, after hearing the entire Ramayana, "Who is Sitā to Rāmā?" I’ve already explained Sahaja Yoga, but I’m happy to explain it again.

Let me give you an example:
When we want to make a car, we first create the wheels and other parts. Once all the material is ready and in good condition, only then can we use the car. Or take this microphone—if it’s not connected to a speaker or electricity, it’s useless. No sound will come from it.

Now, why did God create human beings?
To use them—He created them for a purpose.

Just like Lord Krishna’s flute (Murali)—we select good bamboo, make holes in the right places, and create a perfect instrument. But unless someone like Shri Krishna puts it to his lips and plays it, what’s the use of that flute?

Similarly, in human beings, there is a power called Kundalini Shakti, placed inside us by Parameshwar (God). When that power is awakened and connected to the main source, it becomes as powerful as a super computer.

Many have spoken about this. Shri Krishna explained it in the Bhagavad Gita, and it was later translated by Gyaneshwara in his Gyaneshwari, especially in Chapter 6.

Some people say it takes a lot of penance (tapasyā) to awaken the Kundalini. For example, Gagangiri Mahārāj, a Siddha Sanyasi Yogi, recognized me as Ādi Shakti and said, “You are doing (kundalini awakening) this on a mass scale.”

Recently, we demonstrated to international scientists how Kundalini rises. You can actually see it. But you can’t raise Kundalini just like that—just like a burnt lamp can’t light another lamp. The person must have desire, and a realised soul has to help. For example, if you have a seed, another seed can’t help it grow. You have to plant it in the earth, water it, and give it the right environment—then it grows automatically.

Another person asks:
Do we have to do any upāsanā (worship) or fasting?

Shri Mataji's answers:
No, you don’t have to do any kind of upāsanā or fasting. You just have to sit quietly. Once Kundalini awakens, you start to feel Chaitanya, also called Saundarya Lahari (cool vibrations) flowing from your hands. That’s when you begin to understand your Ātmā (soul). You may feel tingling in your hands, or some sensations in your body.

As Kundalini rises through the chakras (energy centres) and reaches the Brahmarandhra (crown area), it starts indicating any blockages in those chakras. These may feel like tingling, heat, burning sensations, or even sharp pain. For example, someone with asthma or a heart issue may feel burning on the heart chakra, which shows up as heat on the little finger or even chest pain.

Kundalini tries to correct and purify these chakras. Once you’ve come to Sahaja Yoga and become Nirmal (pure), there’s no need for rituals like fasting.

Another question:
Does Lakshmī mean money?

Shri Mataji's answer:
There’s a difference between Lakshmī and money. Money alone doesn’t mean Lakshmī. Lakshmi represents much more—it includes virtues, generosity, and grace.

Someone else asks:
Is this a science?

Shri Mataji's answer:
Yes, this is all connected to science. It relates to the parasympathetic, left, and right sympathetic nervous systems. All of this is explained in Sahaja Yoga. But science doesn’t have pure love, and that’s essential for this to work. This requires pure love.

Another question:
How does it work?

Shri Mataji’s answer:
We check which chakra is blocked or caught. Then we work on it, either with a mantra, or with help from another Sahaja Yogi. For example, if someone has chest pain, we check the heart chakra and help correct the imbalance. When it’s balanced, the pain goes away.

[H. H. Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmaladevi’s second talk in Rāhuri (Musalwādi camp)]

‘Trivār Vandanam’ (I bow three times) to all of you who are searching for the absolute truth. Just like the sea rises in waves, may that same love rise in my heart today.

I told the people in London: “Please come and see our Indian villages. See how much love people have, and how wholeheartedly they attend spiritual programs.”

You need to see how deeply people here love God, how strong their faith is. Even though they are poor, they have unshakable faith in God.

‘Parameshwar hā bhāvāchā bhukelā’ — God Almighty longs for love and devotion. If you really want to see this, come see the people in our villages. God lives in their hearts because they have true love and devotion for Him. The pure love of God flows from their eyes: you can feel it.

They say Bhārat (India) is a ‘Yoga Bhumi’, a land of spiritual discipline. To understand the real meaning of that is deep and not so easy.

A person born in this land, who eats the food grown here, learns a sense of balance in life. One who drinks the water of Bhārat absorbs that purity and self-control. Even our rivers flow within their boundaries — they don’t overflow without purpose.

No matter how high an Indian may rise — even sitting atop elephants in great success, they still carry that inner limit, that sense of right and wrong. That is our true wealth in this world.

If an Indian becomes very rich: ‘kotyādheesh’ (a multimillionaire),  he often feels ashamed to go beyond those moral limits or to behave badly. Yes, some people say there are many ‘Dhōngi lōka’ (fraudsters or pretenders) in India, and that's true. But even they are often afraid to do wrong openly. They fear their conscience, or society itself.

Even those Dhōngi - fraudster people, somewhere deep down, still have a sense of what’s right and what’s wrong. But these days, people start doubting others too easily — even when there’s no reason.

Where we are living now, in UK, that country feels like ‘Narak’ (hell).

They may have more clothes than you, more comforts, but you are the ones going to heaven.

That place may have everything, but nothing there feels natural. There is no real love — only surface-level talk. The love of a mother and father is missing. Society has become dry; relationships lack purity. There's no warmth, no deep human connection. Humanity is lost.

Maybe God has sent me there to help change them. There’s work to be done.

Now, they’ve come to ‘Bharat Bhumi’ (Indian land) our Motherland. Their feet are back on this sacred Indian soil. Once, they ruled over India, but they never truly felt the heart of this land.

Now is the time for them to see the real India. I’ve brought them here to show them what true love for God looks like — something they have lost.

I told them about the greatness of our India, about the people who made great sacrifices, our heroes like Great king-Chhatrapati Shivāji Mahārāj, and especially the warrior women of India. They were amazed to hear about them.

I told them about the saints who were born here and the divine work they did for this land. I spoke to them about the rich spiritual history of India.

The saints of India kept true religion alive: a religion based on purity and love, not on conflict. We must show them what real religion means: not fighting in the name of God, but living in harmony.

In India, when a saint appears, even kings bow before them in respect. You can see this in how Shri Rama bowed before Rishi (sage) Vashistha. That is the greatness of our tradition.

How can you call India poor?

They’ve planted this idea in our minds that an Indian is poor, but we are rich: rich in tradition, in satisfaction, in love, and in happiness. We have each other. We have peace in our hearts.

Even if a king still needs something, then he is not truly a king. For example: I may be married into a rich family, but if you ask me to sleep on the ground, I will sleep happily. That is true contentment.

In England, they have lost the sense of society. There is no satisfaction, no happiness and no joy-‘Ānand,’ even after achieving so much.

Their society is breaking. Every week, you hear about children killing their own parents — two sons killing their father or mother. There is no love between them anymore.

Yes, they once had governance and money, but they lost everything that truly matters. They lost the love of a mother’s milk. Their hearts have turned to stone. How can they ever feel joy if they have become like stone?

Still, we have started Sahaja Yoga there. I recently visited and saw something beautiful — the Kārvad flowers, which grow in harsh places, almost like miracles. In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is growing even in such a hard, cold place. That land may feel like stone, but even there, our spiritual work is happening.

These people are becoming like saints. They are finally realizing that governance and money do not bring real happiness or satisfaction.

On that stage, they realised something important — they once ruled the world and achieved great wealth, but it never brought true happiness or peace. There was no Rāma in their lives, no divine presence, and no inner joy.

So now, they have started to reflect: Why are we really here on this Earth?
Is it just to wake up, eat, enjoy, and then die?
Is that all there is to life?

They have begun seeking, searching for deeper answers. These people are like saints born in that part of the world, now beginning to seek happiness, peace, and God.

At the same time, those who once ruled have now been reborn in India, in the land they once governed.

But what I have seen is painful: some so-called gurus, false sadhus and ‘Bhāmate,’ have gone abroad and exploited innocent people in the name of God.  Just like in our own temples, where some ask for coins and pretend it’s for devotion, they have used God's name to cheat people and live comfortably off their money.

In our land, we have something called Rudhi (traditions) which are meant to lead us to God. But when Rudhi becomes hollow, a dry ritual with no Spirit, it becomes dangerous. We challenged this kind of ‘Dharmāndhatā’ — religious blindness.

I told them: “If you are true, then come and stand in front of me.”
This is what Sahaja Yoga does: it gives a challenge to falseness.

Recently, in Pune, some people told me, “Shrī Mātājī is not a Jāti Brahmin, so we will not give her the place.”
I replied, “If you are real Brahmins, come and stand in front of me.”
They came — and they were shaking.

So I asked, “Why are you trembling?”
They answered, “Because you are Shakti (pure power) and we can feel it.”

I said, “Then who is shaking now?”
They said, “These two.”
I asked, “Where are you coming from?”
They replied, “From Thāne Mental Hospital.”

So I told them, “Your ego makes you think you are special, but that’s why you’re trembling. You are not real.”

Who is a real Brahmin? It is the one who knows, feels, and has experienced the Self (Ātman).
All the Sahaja Yogis are realized souls. They are the true Brahmins.

We want to remove caste-based divisions and the aggression or pride that comes from Jāti (caste) identity. In Sahaja Yoga, there is no caste system.

Great saints like Tukārām Mahārāj worked tirelessly on this issue.
Saint Chokhāmelā composed many Abhangs (devotional poems) speaking against caste discrimination.

But what is the use of just listening to these songs, if we don’t apply their message in real life?

One who truly knows the Spirit or the Brahman, (it doesn’t matter which caste they belong to): they are the real Brahmin!!

‘Pār hoiel’ — the one who gets Self-realization, becomes reborn, and only then reaches the highest caste — that is the real Brahmin!!

If we want to eliminate the caste problem, it’s not enough to just talk about world peace or say, “We are all brothers.” That change has to come from the heart.

And when I see all of you — people from different countries, dancing together with love — that is real brotherhood. It fills my heart with joy.
It reminds me of Vrindavan, the land of Shri Krishna, (Applause)
just like the Gōp, Gōpi, and Gōpikās, dancing with Krishna in divine joy.

Look at these people from the UK — is it even possible to imagine British bosses and officials dancing peacefully with you? (Applause)

But we also have to be careful. There’s another group — “Hāre Rāmā, Hāre Krishnā” — some of them simply buy cheap sāris and dhōtis, don’t even know how to wear them properly, and dance in public.
But there is nothing in their hearts. It’s all for show, just a performance.

This Sahaja Yoga will spread all over the world, and your small village of Musalwādi will become famous in London! (Applause)

Our culture is truly great. If people realize their inner Self and rise to spiritual heights, the whole world will recognize it. But sadly, we ourselves don’t value our culture — we keep putting it down.

There is constant conflict between ‘Shaiva’-Shaivites (devotees of Shiva) and ‘Vaishanava’ Vaishnavites (devotees of Vishnu). Instead of growing spiritually, they argue and create confusion. But the truth is: God is one, only taking different forms and incarnations for different purposes.

Now tell me — who else is going to come and explain this to you?

The concept of Kundalini awakening was already written about by Ādi Shankarāchāryā in the 6th century. He clearly explained the coming of Ādi Shakti’s incarnation, saying that when people come to Her Feet, then their Kundalini will rise automatically.

But even he wrote: “someone has to come and give practical experience”, not just write or talk about it.

Tell me, how many of you read Ādi Shankarāchāryā’s works today?
Do you have time?
How many of you have even read Dāsbōdh?

In the Dāsbōdh, Samarth Rāmdās also wrote about Kundalini.  But reading is not enough.
Without practical experience, it’s like talking about curry and rice without actually tasting the food.

So I say to you — come and get your Self-realisation. Feel it. Experience it.
Only then can any real discussion begin.
Then both your test and my test will happen. Then you will recognize who I am?

Don't debate for any reason: first, get your experience.
Let your own Spirit tell you the truth.

There are great saints today sitting quietly in the forests and the Himalayas. Some say, “We will come after 12 years, or 14 years.”
But I asked them: “Why are you hiding? Who told you to stay in the forest?”

They say, “People will attack us, break our heads. Why should we come out and give them realisation?”

These saints in the Himalayas recognize Me, but they are afraid of you, not of Me.
But once you get your self-realisation, once you feel the divine cool breeze flowing from your own hands — then you’ll know who is a real saint and who is not.

Then you’ll understand whether the stones here in Musalwādi-Rāhuri are just stones or true swayambhus (self-manifested divine forms). (Applause)

There is no other temple of Ādi Shakti like this anywhere. If you build a temple to Ādi Shakti right here in Musalwādi, it will be a: “once-in-a-lifetime” achievement, the fruit of many lifetimes of good karma.

You are blessed to be born in this land.
Mother Earth has chosen you. Feel proud — because Ādi Shakti Herself has come to your village.

This is not a random moment!  It has been known since ancient times that I would come here to give you your Self-realisation.

Don’t fall into shallow thinking. Don’t get caught in small arguments or doubts. This land itself had a demand on me: I had to come here and offer you this gift.

You are very fortunate.  So feel proud of it.

To give Self-realisation to others is a joy beyond any material happiness.
Today, I saw and felt the waves of Ānanda (divine bliss)  Brahmānānda flowing from the Sahasrara chakra above the head.

Please! Don’t fall into trivial matters. Don’t poke your nose into unnecessary problems.
Go deep.

Take for example the ‘Vārkari Sāmpradāya’, the path of the Vārkari devotees who walk to Pandharpur in devotion to Vitthala.

These people are kind-hearted, full of faith, and truly innocent. But the question is — are they really reaching God?

You don’t always see true Dharma there anymore. It feels as if God has gone to sleep.

But once you get your Self-realisation: your Atmasākshātkār, and then visit Pandharpur, only then will God awaken through your presence. Then Adharma, unrighteousness, will start to disappear.

It will work out.

But if you go to Pandharpur without self-realisation, there’s no real point.
God might say: “I’m tired of standing on this brick for centuries while no one truly seeks Me.”

If you really want to see and feel God, you must first experience Self-realisation.

People say, “We have the Tulasi-mālā (garland of Tulsi), so we’re devotees.”
But I ask:  Who gave you that Tulasi-mala? Which guru? And who was his guru?
Were they realised souls — Atmasākshātkāri?

If not, then it is ‘Anādhikār Chestā’ (an unauthorised practice).
Unless that Tulasi-mālā (Tulasi garland) is given by a real Guru, connected to God, it holds no spiritual authority.

It’s not just about doing pujā (worship), or about being a relative of a pujāri (priest).
The pujāri himself must be authorised — truly connected to the Divine. Otherwise, what’s the point?

Once you’ve received your Self-realisation, Dharmā (true religion) awakens within you automatically. Then you know what is right and what is wrong from within.

People ask me, “Shri Mātājī, why can’t we put Bukkā (black ash or powder) on the forehead?”
I say, “It’s not a problem in theory.”

But do you really understand the importance of the human forehead?

This forehead didn’t just appear overnight. It was specially created by God over a long, sacred process. It has deep meaning.

You must only put something vibrational, living, and full of Chaitanya (divine energy) on it.
This forehead holds the Ekādaśa Rudra Shakti (the power of eleven Rudras).

One Rudra alone is powerful enough to destroy all of creation — and you carry eleven within you.
So be careful what you put on this sacred place.

And do not bow your head to just anyone! Especially not to those who are unauthorised.
Many of these black powders are sold commercially, often made from ashes from the smashān (cremation grounds), just for business, not for spirituality.

So I tell you: if you want to apply something, apply only what carries Chaitanya (divine vibrations). That will uplift you.
Otherwise, Lakshmī, the goddess of grace and abundance, will not stay in your home.

All this Boot-vidyā (black magic), fear-based ritualism, must end.
And when it does, the Lakshmi Samrājya (the kingdom of real spiritual wealth) will begin.

And remember: Lakshmi does not just mean money.
She means grace, peace, satisfaction, and auspiciousness, all of which come from a heart connected to the Spirit.

Recently, I visited a place called Kōhalam, where I saw a strange ritual. When someone dies in the family, they bury the body right in front of the house. That means the area is filled with bhoots (unsettled spirits), which affect the people living there.

I asked them, “What is this?”
They said, “It’s our tradition — our Rudhi.”

But I could see it clearly. Everyone was shaking, many were seriously ill.
Thank God, people here don’t follow such practices.

To bring Lakshmi’s presence, the divine principle of grace and prosperity, into our homes, we must know what is right and wrong.
Even a simple, innocent person can feel it.
But we need to understand the spiritual science behind these things.

Why is Lakshmi shown standing on a lotus?
What kind of Shakti (energy) flows from her hands?
We need to become aware and knowledgeable about these truths.

Today, someone walks a bad path, does wrong things, yet people still touch his feet just because he calls himself a Guru. But just being a pujāri (priest) doesn’t make someone a real guru.

Don’t feel bad when truth is spoken. Right is right, and truth is truth.

If you want Lakshmi’s blessing, the governance of prosperity and peace, to stay in your home, then the first step is to remove all bhoots (all negative spirits).

The second step is: stop drinking alcohol.

Some people even say, “Dāru (alcohol) is like our mother.”
And when I speak against it, they say, “You are insulting our mother!”

But, thank God,  the women here are wise. They don’t drink much.
In England, women drink even more than the men!

But I ask: were the great saints and Gurus mad when they said never to drink alcohol?

Alcohol doesn’t just bring sickness and disease.
It corrupts your ‘mati-buddhi’ (intellect). It destroys the Lakshmī principle in you.
It’s against Chaitanya, against Self-awareness.

The moment alcohol enters your house, Lakshmi walks out. So I beg you — don’t drink.

Please, come into the Kingdom of God. Become a citizen of that realm.
Become a Bādshāh (spiritual king).

I have come here only to give you this. Please, take it.

This Ānand Melāvā (festival of Eternal Joy) is taking place right here.
And I am so happy to be part of it.

Like any mother, I want my child to be happy and successful in life.
The only difference is — I have millions of children.
All of humanity is my child, and each one deserves this joy.

Many don’t understand the value of a mother.
But you have respected me as your Mother, and that fills me with joy.

My blessings will remain here, in this place.

Under this tree, people will come one day, asking about Sahaja Yoga, and you must tell them.

Let me tell you a beautiful story:

Once, Nāradā Muni went to Vaikuntha, the heavenly abode of Lord Vishnu.
He asked Rukmini, “Can I see Vitthala?”
Rukmini replied, “Wait, He is in meditation.”

Nāradā was surprised. “Vitthalā himself is Narāyanā — who could He be meditating on?”

Rukmini smiled and said, “He is meditating on his bhaktās” (his devotees).
Just like that, I am meditating on you. I have my attention on you.”

So I too will keep my attention on this land of Musalwādi.

And if you ever face any problem, please don’t hesitate to write to me.

Even if I don’t reply, still, it is your duty to send me a letter if you face any trouble, whether it’s about your family, your health, or your spiritual journey.

I am your Mother, because I have given you re-birth, through your Self-realisation.

Your Kundalini rose through the Shat Chakrās, (the six energy centres), and reached the Brahmarandhra — the Sahasrāra, (the crown of your being).

The Kundalini is one of my ‘Aung’ (own aspects).

How else can I say it?
As your Mother, I bless you.
And I love you.
