 (England)
In the early days, I used to put bandhans on things, but I didn't really believe with my heart. I found it very hard to believe that doing this could actually affect anything. We went to a puja in London, and Mother was talking about bandhans. She said, "When you put a bandhan on something, it's like you're actually telephoning to me." I really thought about it and was trying to imbibe what she was saying.

That night, we were staying at Janet Ridley's flat in London and were going on to Sussex the next day to see Chris's grandfather. We just had Lakshmi then, and she was very small. In the morning, we had to catch a train to go down to Sussex, and when we came to get ready, we couldn't find one of Lakshmi's shoes. It was in November, so it was cold, and she was just a tiny little thing. The flat was very modern, so it wasn't like there were lots of nooks and crannies; it was very clear and not cluttered. We searched high and low but could not find the shoe—it was a little red one. We couldn't find it anywhere, and time was going on. We had to leave to get the train.

Suddenly, I was sitting in the middle of the room—I can just imagine myself in the middle of that carpet there—and I thought, "Bandhan. Put a bandhan on." I started to put the bandhan on, and the shoe dropped into my lap.

Someone was standing next to me, Janet's husband, and he saw it too. He said, "Where did that come from?" And I said, "It just fell through the air."

After that, it had a very profound effect on me because I really, really believed in bandhans. I have always used them since, and I always find them very effective. Whereas if I hadn't had that experience... I don't know.
