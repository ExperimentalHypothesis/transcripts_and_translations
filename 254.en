b'\nEaster Puja. Istanbul (Turkey),\n19 April 1998.\n\nToday, we are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ. That\nis the greatest message of Christ life, not the crucifixion. \n\nAnybody\ncan be crucified and killed, but this dead body of Christ was resurrected from\ndeath. Death itself died and He overcame\nit.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle for ordinary human beings, definitely, but not for Christ,\nbecause He was a Divine person, He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself. So,\nHe could walk on the water, gravity would not affect Him, and also He got\nresurrected because death could not affect Him. \n\nSuch a\ngreat Divine personality, specially created for human beings that people should\nrecognise Him. But they did not recognise Him, they killed Him, in a very brutal\nmanner. And even now they think [the]\ncross is a great thing because Christ died on a cross. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very cruel idea of human beings to respect\nthe cross. What does it show? It shows that people liked all the cruelties done\nto Him, symbolising cross as the one that represented His death and these\natrocities, the way He was tortured.\n\nSo, it was a very sad time when He was crucified. But when\nHe got resurrected it was the most joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful\ntime. The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaj Yoga. If Christ\ncould be resurrected, then if human beings also can be resurrected, because He\ncame as a human being with all powers and He created the path of resurrection\nfor us.\n\nThis path\nof resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaj Yoga. But the\ngreatest thing is the piercing of the Agnya Chakra, which is described in all\nspiritual treaties, or may be called as, the scriptures that, that is the door\nwhich is golden, which is like a cover and no one can pass through that, so constricted\nis this door of Agnya Chakra. But Christ did cross that. \n\nHis\ncrossing has helped us today to open your Agnya. Without opening the Agnya you\ncannot go to Sahastrar. And this was done so easily, in your case, only because Christ could go through all that\ntorture and all that brutality, and crossed over it. \n\nHow much\nwe should be indebted to Him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know words that can express, because He\nis the One who took lead in telling people that: \xe2\x80\x9cYou seek, you seek and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind.\xe2\x80\x9d and then He says that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to come and bang at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d This is\nexactly what has happened in your case: that you have risen up to Agnya and\nthen you have crossed beyond Agnya.\n\nThis crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult for you. Though,\nby your own ideas of thinking and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning\nand all that, it was a big, big crowd of very black clouds [that] were hovering\non the Agnya, thoughts were overpowering you, and you could not have penetrated\nthrough this Agnya which was all covered. But you did, and you never even felt that you have crossed the Agnya\nChakra, so easily.\n\nSo, first of all, we all should really be very thankful to\nChrist for opening the Agnya for you. \n\nFor Him,\nall the tortures and all the brutality were nothing, because the purpose of His\nlife, the purpose of His advent, His incarnation was to break the Agnya chakra.\n\nToday,\nyou will find that even though your Agnya is opened out and you have crossed\nthrough, still you will be amazed that people get involved in the\nAgnya Chakra. In Sahaj Yoga, people do get involved in Agnya Chakra.\n\nNow, how do we see, through introspection, what happens to us? \n\nFor\nexample, once people come to Sahaj Yoga they think they are in charge: in\ncharge of this, in charge of that, in charge of all the Sahaj Yogis. And they\nstart behaving in a manner which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t behove a Sahaj Yogi. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\nhave seen them and I really am amused the way they just start thrusting\nthemselves [forward] and showing off that they are very much in charge. This is\nnothing modern: this used to be there with human beings. But if it was so, it\nwas before Sahaj Yoga. Even now,\npeople get into the mood of dominating others by saying that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in charge!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSahaj\nYoga is not so simple as you think, because there are lots of temptations.\nSupposing you make somebody a leader: now, a leader becomes some sort of in\ncharge and he gets the drunkenness of power. When he is like that, he starts\ndominating all the rest of the people and also starts showing off that he is\nsomething very great and he has to dominate all the rest of the people. Then he\ncreates an atmosphere of fear. Firstly, I have seen, what happens with them is\nthat, they start saying falsely that, \xe2\x80\x9cMother has told this, Mother has said\nso. This is Mother\xe2\x80\x99s idea.\xe2\x80\x9d I have nothing to do with that gentleman but he\ngoes on talking like that and people get very frightened. Then also he can also frighten you by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\ntell Mother! Mother will listen to me and She\xe2\x80\x99ll punish you!\xe2\x80\x9d I am sometimes\nvery surprised at such people because I have never said that I will punish\nsomebody or I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him out of Sahaj Yoga, nothing of the kind. \n\nSo, this\nman who thinks no end of himself, he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may\nbe nothing in Sahaj Yoga: and then he\nstarts talking like this, in such a funny manner that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look that the\nperson is a Sahaj Yogi. \n\nThen he\ngoes even further. He goes describing himself as something very great; as if he\nis the one who is chosen specially for rising higher and higher. When I hear\nabout these things, I am really amazed! How can people befool themselves all\nthe time and behave in such a manner?\n\nFirst\nthing in Sahaj Yoga is humility. If you are not a humble person, you cannot be a Sahaj Yogi. The person who\norders about, the person who talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any person\nwho tries to control and be in charge of the thing, all these capacities only\nshow that that person has achieved nothing\nin Sahaj Yoga. \n\nFirst\nthing is to enjoy the humility. I have seen people like this. They\xe2\x80\x99ll always sit in the first row. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nalways sitting in a place where you just see them all the time there. I just\nsmile: I know they are just show-offs, they think no end of themselves, and\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why they are there. But they themselves are losing, they themselves are\nnot very happy, that\xe2\x80\x99s why they try to do all these tricks and this kind of\ndomination.\n\nThe other side of it is people who are humble, who are\nsimple, who are honest and who are really seeking the Truth, are being\noppressed by this gentleman. He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries to\nmake slaves out of others. And I have seen people have gone so far, that there\nwas a group of people who just would not move even an inch without the permission of their leader. And they would go all\nout to be subservient to such an irrational personality.\n\nFirst of all you know this is the love of Mother. Mother never dominates. She\ncannot dominate because She is nothing but love. As soon as She sees the\nproblem, immediately She absorbs it. She has to make deliberations, just a\ndrama sometimes, to show that She is angry. But She cannot basically be angry\nwith anyone. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\nlove which all the time, all the time, is flowing and that love envelops the\nMother as well as you. That is how you people understand Sahaj Yoga. What does a\nhuman being need is nothing but love and compassion. Love and compassion of a\nvery, very pure type. Look at Christ. He pitied the people who crucified Him.\nHe told His father, The God Almighty that, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease forgive them, because they do\nnot know what they are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d He could see that the blindness of these people,\nare doing wrong things and God the Father would be very annoyed, who is\nwrathful, and may destroy them.\n\nSo, this is what was done with a very compassionate\nfeeling without thinking about it, just automatically He felt that, \xe2\x80\x9cThese\npeople are doing all this to me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will happen to them.\xe2\x80\x9d So,\nHe prayed to God, to Father, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease forgive, please forgive them, for they do\nnot know what they are doing, they are blind, so please do not punish them.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nWhat\ncompassion, what love! I mean, think of it: do we do that in our life if\nsomebody harms us, troubles us? Do we ask Father to forgive those who do not\nknow what they are doing? That should be the level of Sahaj Yoga. And it will\nwork out very well if you ask for forgiveness, God will look after them, He\xe2\x80\x99ll\ntransform them, He\xe2\x80\x99ll bring them to their senses.\n\nThe messages of Christ are full of love, compassion, pure compassion. How He tried to protect\nMary Magdalene is an example of them: who was leading a sinful life and for a\nsaint He had nothing to do with her. But when He saw she being stoned by\npeople, He stood against her, He took a stone in His own hand and He says,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright those who have not committed any wrong deed or have not committed any\nsin, can take this stone and hit me!\xe2\x80\x9d And nobody came forward, because they had\nto face themselves.\n\nWhen we are dominating others, then a\nkind of a cruel joy is there: some sort of a joy that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, myself,\nbut people have. They show off, that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have achieved this joy, we have\nachieved this great power.\xe2\x80\x9d It has happened for centuries with all the great\nemperors and also despotic rulers. But with Sahaj Yogis it should be the other\nway round. They have to rule the world\nwith peace and love. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to show off by any chance. This is how Sahaj\nYoga will spread much, much faster.\n\nWhat does\nthe world need? You just think of it. It needs only love and affection. \n\nThose\npeople who are yet lost in the ignorance about life and are still busy\ntroubling others, torturing others, going against the collectivity will have to\nreturn to normalcy. It\xe2\x80\x99s very abnormal behaviour sometimes and you just don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand why they behave like mad people. It is very difficult also to tell\nsuch people that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad!\xe2\x80\x9d And also is difficult to be with such a person\nwho is so mad with some sort of a power. \n\nIt goes\non like that with so many Sahaj Yogis, I have seen who start thinking they have\nlots of powers, they think they can do whatever they like, they can talk to\nanyone and they can confuse everyone. But in Sahaj Yoga you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\nconfuse, you have to clearly express\nyour love. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean any kind of particular gesture for a\nparticular happening, but it is just an inner oneness with each other.\n\nSometimes\nI find Sahaj Yogis so much understanding each other, so much loving each other,\nso beautifully enjoying the love of other people. When I see that, I feel very,\nvery happy, absolutely overjoyed. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted - [that] these people\nshould enjoy is there. \n\nAnd you\nwill be amazed: the most enjoyable thing is the love that you give to others.\nYou may not receive, but when you give love to others, then it\xe2\x80\x99s the most\nenjoyable thing. But the way you express yourself is also an art I think, to\nunderstand how to please others, how to make them happy.\n\nI told this story before also, about a saint who lived in Gaganbawada: it\xe2\x80\x99s a hill or a mountain.\nHe used to live there. And he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk. Because of vibrations, he lost his\nlegs or something, the power in him. And then he would go all over the place on\na tiger, because the tiger loved him and he loved the tiger. \n\nSo, this\ngentleman was all the time telling people from Bombay, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing\nhere? Mother has come, go and touch Her feet!\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why he was so much\nconcerned. So, I told Sahaj Yogis, \xe2\x80\x9cI must go and meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d So, all these\ngurus they say that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t leave our pillows (takiya). We have to be in our own pillow.\xe2\x80\x9d Means wherever they\nlive, exist, they won\xe2\x80\x99t go out. I\xe2\x80\x99m the other way roun\n\nd. I am\nnever stationed in one place! So, they asked if I could go, so I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d So, I went there and the Sahaj Yogis said that, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, you never go\nanywhere, so why do you want to go here?\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cAlright, see the vibrations!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd it was tremendous vibrations! \n\nSo, when\nI went up, this fellow was very angry\nwith the rain because he was supposed to control the rain, he was supposed to\nbe controlling the rain. It\xe2\x80\x99s very surprising that when I went up, that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nnot control and I got completely drenched. So, he was very angry. He was\nsitting on a stone and doing like this with anger. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to\nhim. I went inside and sat in the cave where he had made some arrangement for me\nto be seated. \n\nThen he\ncame and he touched my feet and he sat down. And I was amazed that he was still angry and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\nwhy the rain could not stopped. So, he asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not allow me to\nstop the rain? Because, after all, you are coming to see me all the way and the\nrain should have behaved! And I also could not, some way or other, control the\nrain, so what was the thing, what was the lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d I just smiled. I said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee,\nyou are an ascetic, you are a sanyasi, and I am your Mother and I cannot take a\nsari from you, because, after all, you are a sanyasi and you are not supposed\nto take anything from a sanyasi.\n\nEven the\nMother cannot take anything from him. But you have bought a nice sari for me\nand I had to get drenched so that I could take a sari from you.\xe2\x80\x9d You see the\nsweetness of mine telling him just made him melt and he started crying.\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need a Mother for this world. There should be the Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d We\ncannot solve, because whatever it is, we get angry. Or we want to disappear. We\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to be with these horrible people who are so sinful to help them.\nThis is the problem with the world today and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you find very few\nspiritual people in the whole world. Because they are the ones who are very\nmuch tortured, troubled, insulted, all kinds of things happened. So they are\nstruggling, struggling, so they want to die very fast.\n\nGyaneshwara such a great personality, such a great writer,\npoet. I mean, He was everything, so beautifully He has written. But at the age\nof 23, He took His Samadhi, means, He went into a cave and closed the cave and\ndied. Must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings of ignorant people.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why He died. You can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara who was the\nincarnation of Kartikeya, had to recede into the world of the dead, because He\ncould not bear any more the way they were torturing Him. They tortured Him so\nmuch, saying that He is the son of a sanyasi, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s like this, son of a\nsanyasi means, He\xe2\x80\x99s no good, He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely like an illegitimate child, and\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s ill treated to such an extent, He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have shoes to wear, in that\nheat of India, He used to walk barefoot. And His sister, brother who were great\nscholars, who were great saints, great incarnations, all of them. As a result,\nHe wanted just to disappear, and He made a beautiful way of doing it, that He\ntold them that: \xe2\x80\x9cI have to go.\xe2\x80\x9d And He took leave from them, and went inside\nHis cave, and got His Samadhi.\n\nEven Christ was very young when He was crucified. He was\n33 years of age. It was all planned by the Divine that He was to be crucified\nto make way for our Sahaj Yoga, to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His life, and\nfor Him to be hanged in such a horrendous cruel way, which normally you do not\nfind people behaving in such a manner towards a person who is about to die.\nSo what happened? Those people who were in charge of His crucifixion must have\nbeen some devils, the way they behaved. It is not possible to forgive them,\neven if He, Christ, says. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to forgive such people who were\nwatching the crucifixion of Christ.\n\nSo, if that is the case that a person like Him thought\nthat: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me do my job: is to break Sahastrara.\xe2\x80\x9d And then He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\nlive, live with these stupid people to be tortured and He just disappeared into\nKashmir, where He lived after His resurrection. Lots of stories are there about\nHis ascent and His resurrection. And, you see, all those stories, if you read,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be amazed how miraculous. He got His second birth, we can say, or second\nlife in Kashmir. He lived in Kashmir happily for some time, with His mother,\nand there He died. They say there is a grave of our Lord Jesus Christ and also\nHis Mother was there. But who has taken advantage of His life, from His life?\nWho are the people really who wanted Him to die? You know very well! You know\nvery well how Christ died, and the people came up suddenly, like Paul and\nPeter, who tried to make a big business out of it. It is very sad to see that\nthese two persons brought such a shame.\n\nThis Paul was nothing but an organiser, I think, a person\nwho was bureaucratic, I should say. But he was not only bureaucratic, he was\nalso a man who wanted to have a big position. So he told a lie, that he went\ndown to Damascus, and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross. According to Sahaj\nYoga, all such signs are the sign of supraconscious. It\xe2\x80\x99s not of the Spirit.\nAnd then he came back and he started his own research and sort of things like\nthat, and he\xe2\x80\x99s written a lot of things, but throughout, if you read, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind that he was not a Sahaj Yogi, he was just an organiser, he was a\nbureaucratic personality who was writing how we should administer, how we\nshould have people who are different types of people, how should we manage\nthem. So he is management department, he was the management department for the\nChristians.\n\nSo the Christians also became extremely very secretarial\ntype like, you see, everything has a time, you must come like this, you must\nsit like this, just talk like this. And also the nations which are supposed to\nbe Christians are observing all that in a very official manner. It is not\nunderstood why are they so much official. Just the opposite what Christ did, is\nto break the Agnya, they built up this. And the Christian nations became the\nmost arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole world. For them, it was\ntheir right to occupy any land they saw. It was in their right to establish\ntheir own laws, their own, I should say, assemblies. All this is done in India,\nI know, even today, if you go to places like Punjab. And all of them, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind the people are just living like rustic people, working very hard, and they\nare all the time under attack, from people who are dominating, and those who\nwanted the full advantage to be taken out of these people. It was a ridiculous\nthing to behave like that as Christians.\n\nThen, also they started converting them. It\xe2\x80\x99s another\nnonsense, converting them. In the South, what they did, is to\xe2\x80\xa6: we, Indians,\nnever make breads. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to use your oven in the South. So they\nmade huge big cake \xe2\x80\x93 you can call it a cake, or you can call it a bread \xe2\x80\x93 and\nput it in the water, or in a well, and they would say that: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have put the\npart of the calf, of a buffalo, or could be a cow,\xe2\x80\x9d and they just believed\nthem. And so, they said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, you are finished, because you are no more\nbelonging to Hindu religion or to any other religion. So, now, you have become\nChristians.\xe2\x80\x9d And that\xe2\x80\x99s how they made thousands and thousands people of\nChristians who were actually downtrodden people, I should say. I still call\nthem \xe2\x80\x9cdowntrodden\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nNow, all these downtrodden people, they wanted to have\nconverted to Christianity. Because, they thought they all wanted all such\npeople who would just follow the missionaries, and who would not question.\nBecause they were not educated people, they\xe2\x80\x99re not people of any understanding\nor intelligence to understand what these people are. So, when they started\nthis, directed against the downtrodden people, so many of them joined. Just\nthey found their own race and they started their business.\nThis is a thing one should understand. How the dominating nature of people\naccepted a particular religion because that religion is nothing but humility.\nAnd how then these people, supposed to be in charge of Christianity converted\npeople into something absurd. You see, it is a human nature, it can enjoy any\nnonsense, any kind of cruelty, any kind of oppression. It can never give up\nthat realm, that area where they have been dominating.\nNow as it is, the Christian nations have gone even beyond that, because among\nthe Christians, it is all the freedom given to them, they are liberated: \xe2\x80\x9cDo\nwhatever you may like, it will become better, you are all right.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed they\nare the ones who have been dominating, and those who are dominated are there\neverywhere. They would go to ordinary people whom you can call as Aboriginals\nand convert them. Their main method was to convert. What was the need to\nconvert so many people? Because in democracy, it is important that the number\nyou have should be large. So to gain the number, they used to convert. And it\nhas ruin so many things.\n\nSee, the whole situation of Christ really makes me feel\nvery nervous. Today, you all are Sahaj Yogis, you are all so much higher than\nothers, you have all the powers, and then supposing you want to behave like the\nChristians, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you will do. So now you are on the verge where Sahaj\nYoga is accepted in different countries. And there people respect people who\nare Sahaj Yogis, they have even positions. Then suddenly you might get this\npower business into your head, and you may try, you may try to become like a\ndespot, because that is human nature. That\xe2\x80\x99s not Divine. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a human\nnature. For example, when in the kingdom of, you can say, of the animals, they\nare aggressive on each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, it\xe2\x80\x99s permitted, is that, but\nthere is a system, there\xe2\x80\x99s a way, there\xe2\x80\x99s a method how they dominate. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\nlike they jump on everyone.\nBut I have seen in Sahaj Yoga, many people, you make them a leader, finished!\nThen, he sits on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s head. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t make them a leader, then they\ngo on writing letters to me, one after another, that: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we want to be\nleader, I want to be a leader.\xe2\x80\x9d Like this they go on insisting. For what do you\nwant to be a leader? Just to dominate others. And this domination business is\nnot meant for Sahaj Yogis.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m here today to tell you about a beautiful image of Christ who rose above\nthat. In the same way let the death of all nonsensical ideas, all negative\nthoughts, everything has to be overcome. You have to be the Lord of yourself,\nand in that you should feel so comforted, so happy. In giving others, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind it very much easier than taking something from others. It\xe2\x80\x99s very, very\nsurprising how Sahaj Yoga has taught you all these things. In Sahaj Yoga people\nhave to say that they are very wonderful, they are very beautiful people, they\nare very loving, they are very kind. I want to hear that all the time about\nthem about you all, that you all are individually or collectively, you are\nsomething outstandingly great. But this greatness is not by domination or by\nshowing off, but it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from within. People see you and know it is\nsomething, and that is how Sahaj Yoga is going to spread.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Christ within you who has to arise, Christ within\nyou who has to guide. It is Christ within you who will teach how to behave\ntowards others and how to gain their confidence, and give them the love and\npeace that you have now flowing within you, to make them very very happy and\njoyous people. This is the message of resurrection, this is the message of\nbreaking the Sahastrara.\nSo this egg which was described in a very surprising way, very clearly\ndescribed in Devi Mahatmyam; how this egg was formed and was broken into two,\nand from one part of the egg came out Christ. Another part was Shri Ganesha.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all written down. But this Christ is described as Mahavishnu, not as\nChrist. So this Mahavishnu then grows, and He does all these, all wonderful\nthings. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real message, beautifully written by the life of Christ, that\nnow, as we are thoughtlessly aware, now we have to express that light through\nour lives. And we have to show to the world that we are quite capable, and that\nonly we are within ourselves absolutely complete. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything from\nothers. What we want now to give whatever we have achieved to others. This is\nwhat people are looking at you and at all the Sahaj Yogis.\nMay God bless you all!\n\nThinking of Christ, I find it impossible to keep awaken,\nbecause to keep in these modern times is very difficult when you are thinking\nof Christ and talking about Him. It\xe2\x80\x99s just something, shows that how people\nnever understood such a great man, such a great personality. And He was Divine!\nAbsolutely Divine. Despite that, He made a drama, we should say, to go through\nall the suffering. It\xe2\x80\x99s very painful, even to remember all that, how He\ncrucified Himself, and He how He died.\nBut the main point is this, He\xe2\x80\x99s done for you, for all of you. And you are so\nindebted to Him. It is His work which has helped the Kundalini to be awakened\nand could pass through this fontanel bone area. All this would have been\nimpossible without the sacrifice of Christ. You all should thus deserve to have\nsome sacrifices.\nSee, this is a very symbolic thing that has happened. And you all should be all\nthe time prepared to sacrifice whatever is possible for the emancipation of\nhumanity. It\xe2\x80\x99s very, very subtle at this moment now. Forget about seeking,\nforget about everything, what is needed is that you have to remember all the\ntime that you are saints, you are being blessed by the sacrifices of Christ.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\n\nMay God bless you!\n'
