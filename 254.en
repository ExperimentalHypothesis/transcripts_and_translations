Easter Puja. Istanbul (Turkey), 19 April 1998.

Today, we are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ. That is the greatest message of Christ life, not the crucifixion.

Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this dead body of Christ was resurrected from death. Death itself died and He overcame it.

It’s a miracle for ordinary human beings, definitely, but not for Christ,
because He was a Divine person, He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself. So,
He could walk on the water, gravity would not affect Him, and also He got
resurrected because death could not affect Him. 

Such a great Divine personality, specially created for human beings that people should recognise Him. But they did not recognise Him, they killed Him, in a very brutal manner. And even now they think [the] cross is a great thing because Christ died on a cross. It’s a very cruel idea of human beings to respect the cross. What does it show? It shows that people liked all the cruelties done to Him, symbolising cross as the one that represented His death and these atrocities, the way He was tortured.

So, it was a very sad time when He was crucified. But when He got resurrected it was the most joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful time. The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaj Yoga. If Christ could be resurrected, then if human beings also can be resurrected, because He came as a human being with all powers and He created the path of resurrection for us.

This path of resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaj Yoga. But the greatest thing is the piercing of the Agnya Chakra, which is described in all spiritual treaties, or may be called as, the scriptures that, that is the door which is golden, which is like a cover and no one can pass through that, so constricted is this door of Agnya Chakra. But Christ did cross that.

His crossing has helped us today to open your Agnya. Without opening the Agnya you cannot go to Sahasrar. And this was done so easily, in your case, only because Christ could go through all that torture and all that brutality, and crossed over it.

How much we should be indebted to Him, I don’t know words that can express, because He is the One who took lead in telling people that: “You seek, you seek and you’ll find.” and then He says that, “You have to come and bang at the door.” This is exactly what has happened in your case: that you have risen up to Agnya and then you have crossed beyond Agnya.

This crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult for you. Though, by your own ideas of thinking and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning and all that, it was a big, big crowd of very black clouds [that] were hovering on the Agnya, thoughts were overpowering you, and you could not have penetrated through this Agnya which was all covered. But you did, and you never even felt that you have crossed the Agnya Chakra, so easily.

So, first of all, we all should really be very thankful to Christ for opening the Agnya for you.

For Him, all the tortures and all the brutality were nothing, because the purpose of His life, the purpose of His advent, His incarnation was to break the Agnya chakra.

Today, you will find that even though your Agnya is opened out and you have crossed through, still you will be amazed that people get involved in the Agnya Chakra. In Sahaj Yoga, people do get involved in Agnya Chakra.

Now, how do we see, through introspection, what happens to us? 

For example, once people come to Sahaj Yoga they think they are in charge: in charge of this, in charge of that, in charge of all the Sahaj Yogis. And they start behaving in a manner which doesn’t behove a Sahaj Yogi. It doesn’t. I have seen them and I really am amused the way they just start thrusting themselves [forward] and showing off that they are very much in charge. This is nothing modern: this used to be there with human beings. But if it was so, it was before Sahaj Yoga. Even now, people get into the mood of dominating others by saying that, “We are in charge!”

Sahaj Yoga is not so simple as you think, because there are lots of temptations. Supposing you make somebody a leader: now, a leader becomes some sort of in charge and he gets the drunkenness of power. When he is like that, he starts dominating all the rest of the people and also starts showing off that he is something very great and he has to dominate all the rest of the people. Then he creates an atmosphere of fear. Firstly, I have seen, what happens with them is that, they start saying falsely that, “Mother has told this, Mother has said so. This is Mother’s idea.” I have nothing to do with that gentleman but he goes on talking like that and people get very frightened. Then also he can also frighten you by saying, “I will tell Mother! Mother will listen to me and She’ll punish you!” I am sometimes very surprised at such people because I have never said that I will punish somebody or I’ll take him out of Sahaj Yoga, nothing of the kind.

So, this man who thinks no end of himself, he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may be nothing in Sahaj Yoga: and then he starts talking like this, in such a funny manner that it doesn’t look that the person is a Sahaj Yogi.

Then he goes even further. He goes describing himself as something very great; as if he is the one who is chosen specially for rising higher and higher. When I hear about these things, I am really amazed! How can people befool themselves all the time and behave in such a manner?

First thing in Sahaj Yoga is humility. If you are not a humble person, you cannot be a Sahaj Yogi. The person who orders about, the person who talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any person who tries to control and be in charge of the thing, all these capacities only show that that person has achieved nothing in Sahaj Yoga.

First thing is to enjoy the humility. I have seen people like this. They’ll always sit in the first row. They’ll be always sitting in a place where you just see them all the time there. I just smile: I know they are just show-offs, they think no end of themselves, and that’s why they are there. But they themselves are losing, they themselves are not very happy, that’s why they try to do all these tricks and this kind of domination.

The other side of it is people who are humble, who are simple, who are honest and who are really seeking the Truth, are being oppressed by this gentleman. He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries to make slaves out of others. And I have seen people have gone so far, that there was a group of people who just would not move even an inch without the permission of their leader. And they would go all out to be subservient to such an irrational personality.

First of all you know this is the love of Mother. Mother never dominates. She
cannot dominate because She is nothing but love. As soon as She sees the
problem, immediately She absorbs it. She has to make deliberations, just a
drama sometimes, to show that She is angry. But She cannot basically be angry
with anyone. 

It’s the love which all the time, all the time, is flowing and that love envelops the Mother as well as you. That is how you people understand Sahaj Yoga. What does a human being need is nothing but love and compassion. Love and compassion of a very, very pure type. Look at Christ. He pitied the people who crucified Him. He told His father, The God Almighty that, “Please forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.” He could see that the blindness of these people, are doing wrong things and God the Father would be very annoyed, who is wrathful, and may destroy them.

So, this is what was done with a very compassionate
feeling without thinking about it, just automatically He felt that, “These
people are doing all this to me and I don’t know what will happen to them.” So,
He prayed to God, to Father, “Please forgive, please forgive them, for they do
not know what they are doing, they are blind, so please do not punish them.” 

What compassion, what love! I mean, think of it: do we do that in our life if somebody harms us, troubles us? Do we ask Father to forgive those who do not know what they are doing? That should be the level of Sahaj Yoga. And it will work out very well if you ask for forgiveness, God will look after them, He’ll transform them, He’ll bring them to their senses.

The messages of Christ are full of love, compassion, pure compassion. How He tried to protect Mary Magdalene is an example of them: who was leading a sinful life and for a saint He had nothing to do with her. But when He saw she being stoned by people, He stood against her, He took a stone in His own hand and He says, “Alright those who have not committed any wrong deed or have not committed any sin, can take this stone and hit me!” And nobody came forward, because they had to face themselves.

When we are dominating others, then a
kind of a cruel joy is there: some sort of a joy that I don’t understand, myself,
but people have. They show off, that, “We have achieved this joy, we have
achieved this great power.” It has happened for centuries with all the great
emperors and also despotic rulers. But with Sahaj Yogis it should be the other
way round. They have to rule the world
with peace and love. They don’t have to show off by any chance. This is how Sahaj
Yoga will spread much, much faster.

What does the world need? You just think of it. It needs only love and affection.

Those people who are yet lost in the ignorance about life and are still busy troubling others, torturing others, going against the collectivity will have to return to normalcy. It’s very abnormal behaviour sometimes and you just don’t understand why they behave like mad people. It is very difficult also to tell such people that, “You are mad!” And also is difficult to be with such a person who is so mad with some sort of a power.

It goes on like that with so many Sahaj Yogis, I have seen who start thinking they have lots of powers, they think they can do whatever they like, they can talk to anyone and they can confuse everyone. But in Sahaj Yoga you don’t have to confuse, you have to clearly express your love. But that doesn’t mean any kind of particular gesture for a particular happening, but it is just an inner oneness with each other.

Sometimes I find Sahaj Yogis so much understanding each other, so much loving each other, so beautifully enjoying the love of other people. When I see that, I feel very, very happy, absolutely overjoyed. That’s what I wanted - [that] these people should enjoy is there.

And you will be amazed: the most enjoyable thing is the love that you give to others. You may not receive, but when you give love to others, then it’s the most enjoyable thing. But the way you express yourself is also an art I think, to understand how to please others, how to make them happy.

I told this story before also, about a saint who lived in Gaganbawada: it’s a hill or a mountain. He used to live there. And he couldn’t walk. Because of vibrations, he lost his legs or something, the power in him. And then he would go all over the place on a tiger, because the tiger loved him and he loved the tiger.

So, this gentleman was all the time telling people from Bombay, “What are you doing here? Mother has come, go and touch Her feet!” I didn’t know why he was so much concerned. So, I told Sahaj Yogis, “I must go and meet him.” So, all these gurus they say that, “We don’t leave our pillows (takiya). We have to be in our own pillow.” Means wherever they live, exist, they won’t go out. I’m the other way round, I am never stationed in one place! So, they asked if I could go, so I said, “Why not?” So, I went there and the Sahaj Yogis said that, “Mother, you never go anywhere, so why do you want to go here?” I said: “Alright, see the vibrations!” And it was tremendous vibrations!

So, when I went up, this fellow was very angry with the rain because he was supposed to control the rain, he was supposed to be controlling the rain. It’s very surprising that when I went up, he not control [it] and I got completely drenched. So, he was very angry. He was sitting on a stone and doing like this (moving head from side to side) with anger. I didn’t say anything to him. I went inside and sat in the cave where he had made some arrangement for me to be seated.

Then he
came, he touched my feet and he sat down. And I was amazed that he was still angry and he couldn’t understand
why the rain could not stop. So, he asked me, “Why did you not allow me to stop
the rain? Because, after all, you were coming to see me all the way and the
rain should have behaved! And I also could not, somehow or other, control the
rain. So what was the thing, what was the lesson?” I just smiled. I said. “See,
you are an ascetic, you are a sanyasi, and I am your Mother. I cannot take a sari from you because,
after all, you are a sanyasi and you are not supposed to take anything from a
sanyasi.” Even the Mother cannot take anything from him. “But you have bought a
nice sari for me and I had to get drenched so that I could take a sari from
you.” You see the sweetness of my telling him just made him melt away and he
started crying.

He said, “We need a Mother for this world. There should be The Mother.” We
cannot solve the problem because whatever it is, we get angry. Or we want to
disappear. We don’t want to be with these horrible people who are so sinful to
help them. This is the problem with the world today and that’s why you find very few spiritual people in the whole
world. Because they are the ones who are being very much tortured, troubled,
insulted, all kinds of things happened. So they are struggling and struggling,
so they want to die very fast.

Gyaneshwara: such a great personality, such a great writer, poet. I mean, He was everything. So beautiful He has written. But at the age of 23, He took His Samadhi, means He went into a cave and closed the cave and died there. He must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings of ignorant people, and that’s why He did it.

So, we can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara, who was the incarnation of Kartikeya, had to recede into the world of the dead because He could not bear it any more the way they were torturing them. They tortured Him so much, saying that He is the son of a sanyasi. I mean it’s like this: son of a sanyasi means, He’s no good. He’s absolutely like an illegitimate child, and He’s ill treated to such an extent.

He didn’t even have shoes to wear: in that heat of India, He used to walk with bare feet. And His sister, brother who were great scholars, who were great saints, great incarnations, all of them suffered. As a result, He wanted just to disappear, and He made a beautiful way of doing it, that He told them that, “I have to go.” And He took leave from them, and went inside His cave, and got His Samadhi.

Even Christ was very young when He was crucified. He was 33 years of age. It was all planned by the Divine that He was to be crucified to make way for our Sahaj Yoga, to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His life, and for Him to be hanged in such a horrendous, cruel way; which normally you do not find people behaving in such a manner towards a person who is about to die. So what happened [was] that those people who were in charge of His crucifixion must have been some devils, the way they behaved. It is not possible to forgive them, even if Christ, says. It’s difficult to forgive such people who were watching the crucifixion of Christ.

So, if that is the case that a person like Him thought that, “Let me do my job: is to break Sahasrar.” And then He didn’t want to live, live with these stupid people to be tortured, and He just disappeared into Kashmir where He lived after His resurrection.

Lots of stories are there about His ascent and His resurrection. And, all those stories, if you read, you’ll be amazed how miraculously He got His second birth or second life in Kashmir. He lived in Kashmir happily for some time with His mother and there He died. They say there’s a grave of our Lord Jesus Christ and also His Mother was there. But who has taken advantage of His life, from His life? Who are the people really who wanted Him to die? You know very well! You know very well. How Christ died, and the people came up suddenly, like Paul and Peter, who tried to make a big business out of it. It’s very sad to see that these two persons brought such a shame.

This Paul was nothing but an organiser, I think. He was a person who was bureaucratic, I should say. But he was not only bureaucratic, he was also a man who wanted to have a big position. So he told a lie that: he went down to Damascus, and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross. According to Sahaj Yoga, all such signs are the sign of supraconscious. It’s not of the Spirit. And then he came back and he started his own research and things like that. And he’s written a lot of things. But throughout, if you read, you will find that he was not a Sahaj Yogi. He was just an organiser. He was a bureaucratic personality who was writing: “how we should administer, how we should have people who are different types of people, how should we manage them.” So he was the management department for the Christians.

So the Christians also became extremely secretarial types like: everything has a time, you must come like this, you must sit like this, you must talk like this. And also the nations which are supposed to be Christians are observing all that in a very official manner. It is not understood why they are so much official in everything. Just the opposite [of] what Christ did [which] is to break the Agnya, they built up this.

And the Christian nations became the most arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole world. For them it was their right to occupy any land they saw. It was in their right to establish their own laws, their own assemblies. All this is done in India, I know. Even today, if you go to places like Punjab and all that you will find the people are just living like rustic people, working very hard, and they are all the time under attack from people who are dominating, and those who wanted the full advantage to be taken out of these people. It was a ridiculous thing to behave like that, as Christians.

Then, also they started converting them. This is another nonsense – converting. Converting them. And in the South, what they did is to...we, Indians, never make breads. They don’t know how to use an oven in the South. So they made huge big cakes – you can call it a cake, or you can call it a bread – and put it in the water, or in a well, and they would say that, “We have put the part of the calf,” of a buffalo, or could be a cow, and they just believed them. And so, they said, “Now, you are finished, because you are no more belonging to Hindu religion or to any other religion. So, now, you have become Christians.” And that’s how they made thousands and thousands of people Christians who were actually downtrodden people, I should say. At least they would call themselves downtrodden.

Now, all these downtrodden people, they wanted to have converted to Christianity because they thought they all wanted all such people who would just follow the missionaries and who would not question. Because they were not educated people, they were not people of any understanding or intelligence to understand what these people are. So, when they started this, tirade against the downtrodden people, so many of them joined them. Thus they found their own race and they started their business.

This is a thing one should understand: how the dominating nature of people
accepted a particular religion because that religion is nothing but humility.
And how then these people, supposed to be in charge of Christianity, converted
people into something absurd. It is a human nature: it can enjoy any nonsense,
any kind of cruelty, any kind of oppression. It can never give up that realm, that area, where they have been dominating.

Now as it is, the Christian nations have gone even beyond that because among
the Christians it is all the freedom given to them, they are ‘liberated’: “Do
whatever you may like if you become Christian! You are all right.” Isn’t it? They
are the ones who have been dominating, and those who are dominated are there,
everywhere. They would go to ordinary people whom you can call as Aboriginals
and convert them. Their main method was to convert. What was the need to
convert so many people? Because in democracy it is important that the number
you have should be large. So to gain the number, they used to convert. And it
has ruined so many things.

See, the whole situation of Christ really makes me feel very nervous.

Today, you all are Sahaj Yogis. You are all so much higher than others, you have all the powers. And then supposing you want to behave like the Christians, I don’t know what you will do.

So now you are on the verge where Sahaj Yoga is accepted in different countries. And there people respect people who are Sahaj Yogis, they have [been] given positions. Then suddenly you might get this power business into your head, and you may try, you may try to become like a despot, because that is human nature: that’s not Divine, but that’s a human nature. For example, when in the kingdom of the animals, they are aggressive on each other - it’s all right, it’s permitted, it’s done. But there is a system, there’s a way, there’s a method how they dominate. It’s not like they jump on everyone. But I have seen in Sahaj Yoga, many people, you make them a leader, finished! Then, he sits on everybody’s head. If you don’t make them a leader, then they go on writing letters to me, one after another, that, “Mother, we want to be leader. I want to be a leader.” Like this they go on insisting on that. For what do you want to be a leader? Just to dominate others. And this domination business is not meant for a Sahaj Yogi.

I am here today to tell you about the beautiful image of Christ who rose above death.
In the same way let the death of all nonsensical ideas, all negative thoughts: everything
has to be overcome now. You have to be the Lord of yourself, and in that you
should feel so comforted, so happy. In giving others, you will find it very
much easier than taking something from others.

It’s very, very surprising how Sahaj Yoga has taught you all these things. In Sahaj Yog people have to say that, “They are very wonderful, they are very beautiful people, they are very loving, they are very kind.” I want to hear that all the time about you all, that you all are individually or collectively, you are something outstandingly great. But this greatness is not by domination or by showing off but is coming from within. People see you and know it is something, and that is how Sahaj Yoga is going to spread.

It’s the Christ within you who has to arise, Christ within you who has to guide. It is Christ within you who will teach how to behave towards others and how to gain their confidence, and give them the love and peace that you have now flowing within you, to make them very, very, happy and joyous people. This is the message of resurrection. This is the message of breaking the Sahasrar.

So this egg which was described in the - very surprising - very clearly
described in the Devi Mahatmyam: how this egg was formed and was broken into two,
and from one part of the egg came out Christ. Another part was Shri Ganesha.
It’s all written down. But this Christ is described as Mahavishnu, not as
Christ. So this Mahavishnu then rose, and He does all these, all wonderful
things. It’s a real message, beautifully written, by the life of Christ that
now, as we are thoughtlessly aware now, we have to express that light through
our lives. And we have to show to the world that we are quite capable, and that
only we are within ourselves, absolutely
complete. We don’t want anything from others. What we want now is to give
whatever we have achieved to others. This is what people are looking at you and
at all the Sahaj Yogis.

May God bless you all!

Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to keep awake even, because to keep in these modern times is very difficult when you are thinking of Christ and talking about Him. It’s just something, shows that how people never understood such a great man, such a great personality. And He was Divine, absolutely Divine. And despite that, He made a drama to go through all the sufferings. It’s very painful even to remember all that, how He crucified Himself, and He how He died.

But the main point is this: He’s done it for you, for all of you. And you are
so indebted to Him. 

It is His work which has helped the Kundalini to be awakened and could pass through this fontanel bone area. All this would have been impossible without the sacrifice of Christ. You all should deserve to have some sacrifices.

This is a very symbolic thing that has happened. And you all should be all the
time prepared to sacrifice whatever is possible for the emancipation of
humanity. It’s very, very subtle at this moment now: forget about your seeking,
forget about everything! What is needed is that you have to remember all the
time that you are saved, you are being blessed, by the sacrifices of Christ.
It’s very important.

May God bless you all!
