Quote from Nirmala Yoga

All should clean their inner beings. You should think “why have we come to Sahaja Yoga ? What benefits have we got and what can we get? Where do we go wrong ? What should we do further ? Where are our pitfalls ? What have we left and taken for our growth?” I find, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, in most of our wakeful time, we think of external things. We must see how much loving and devoted to God, we are.
