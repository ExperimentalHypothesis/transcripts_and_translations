You all have decided to marry and you have agreed to marry the wives that we have chosen for you. Now one responsibility you must know [cut in the video].
And if you have still any confusion about this, you should decide not to marry. But after marriage, the responsibility is that you make it a happy, joyous marriage.

The key of the whole thing is that your wife is also a Sahaja Yogini, and don’t try to find faults with her, but find the good points in your wife. That will make you happy and will make her happy. So, I don’t hope that with sixty people here, or sixty-five, that there will be problems for Me after the marriage.

You can decide now if you don’t want to marry, you can decide now and say, "No". But afterwards, you should not try to find faults.

Secondly, you have to protect your wife, that’s your status, that’s your – I should say- that’s your pride. You have to protect your wife.

And thirdly, you are a part and parcel of Sahaja Yoga activity and collectivity.

All these things, I want to tell you again and again, so that there is no more problems for Me. After you are married, you must know how to enjoy your sahaj married life.
May God bless you all.
Thank you very much.

I wish you all [unclear], best of it. [Laughter]
