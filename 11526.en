ARRIVAL TALK AT KUALA LUMPUR 01.11.1990

Shri Mataji: You are out! You are all prepared! Nice to see you all. You have so many flowers! Can I have some water? Name of yogi [UNCLEAR] How is your work? 

Thank you (Yogi giving the water). (Shri Mataji asking for foldable hand fan â€˜Phanca" in Hindi) In my purse. You people have given me already isn't it (yogis giving flowers)? Mother for your Good Life, as long as we have a good life we are able to. Look at these lotuses. This is Mahalakshmi's style; very big. You had rain here? 

Yogi: Yes, raining yesterday. This morning also.

Shri Mataji: All cleared out. The atmosphere is clean because of that. Lots of Indians are here? Lots of Indians! Hello! (Yogi giving flowers) May God Bless you. 

Here it is, the purse. He is searching there. Tell him it is here. 

Yogini: (Asking Shri Mataji whether she can fan Her) Mother! can I do?

Shri Mataji: No, I am alright. special child, you are. Only one person can do it.

Yogi: I can do it for you.

Shri Mataji: It is alright. So how is Perth now? I was told hangar has been done partly. What is the height of the hangar?

Yogi: Hangar is actually big, fabricated, it is still in the factory. Because It has taken a while to get the building pass, permission. Because, we had to show what we wanted; a big hassle, so that they give us approval for production.

Shri Mataji! Because for people to build they must be having an objection? 

Yogi: Rule is that so many people [UNCLEAR] so that they have to give us permission.

Shri Mataji: If pre-fabricated not much work then.

Yogi: That's right.

Shri Mataji: (looking at the flowers) This is the place of Mahalakshmi. These flowers only we have in India in Kolhapur that's all, these flowers. ( Shri Mataji telling a Sahaja yogi) Why don't you sit up there? You have to be comfortable in Sahaja Yoga. Go up and sit. 

I was thinking that the water, Ng told me that it is much cheaper to buy here. Whatever we have to buy, we buy here and these people will come to the airport and hand it over to you when you are going, in the same plane. You can put them in suitcases or something.

But, you go directly or stop at S'pore?

Yogi: We stop at Singapore only for an hour.

Shri Mataji: Your baggage will go direct?

Yogi: The luggage will go direct.

Shri Mataji: To give them, somebody has to go.

Ng: Or they can stop over here.

Yogi: Ya, that's the other thing. We can tell them to stop here and pick it up.

Ng: You can spend a day or two here. 

Shri Mataji: Laughing

Shri Mataji: How many coming from Perth?

Yogi: From Perth 5 and 50 from Sydney.

Shri Mataji: If Sydney people can come via Singapore also it is possible, it can be kept in the handbags.

Yogi: Customs are a bit funny.

Shri Mataji: Australia? how they trouble me, My God! They are horrible. I think they take money. Very funny. No customs troubled me as they did. Actually, I didn't know what was inside. I told them also I don't know, this is for our Puja we brought it. Still, they got after me. I said you take away and do what you like. See, the economy is so bad, who is going to send anything there.

Yogi: It is worse.

Shri Mataji: Worse; they wanted me to send them something from India. They sent me all those things UNCLEAR. The main problem is the economy has gone down so much that it will all be a waste. They wanted to start a business, I stopped and told: "you do know what is the situation there". Thank God!

Yogi: That was Robert, my brother.

Shri Mataji: Your brother? Our Avinash flying very high. I had to stop him.

Yogi: Europe and Russia.? (Yogi asking about Shri Mataji's Europe and Russia Self Realization Tour)

Shri Mataji: Oh ! Russia. Nobody will believe if I tell want happened. I mean they just accepted Me as Power of GOD. They are so wise and deep. Maybe there has always been introspection in their character. They are writers, novelists, be anything. There has been introspection. They are not like western people, like others who have got so-called freedom. So much of our attention is wasted. Just they saw me and just there. We have 600 doctors who are practising Sahaja yoga. They are learning about it; there is the proper school is going about. Two Hundred scientists of very high level, one who met UNCLEAR. ; absolutely there. See our ego is so much that we are in the dungeon of the artists. For any program, there has to be a stadium for 14000 to 16000. Even in Bucharest, Oh My GOD! You won't believe how they are working out. You may be frightened that they might even break the hall; unbelievable. They do not have any false gurus. They understand who is a false guru, who is not. We in the west pay for something UNCLEAR. 

Say, In America, we have altogether only 100 Sahaja yogis throughout compared to Russia. Just hundred somehow or other sticking on. But, Even I went to South America, tremendous! Even Sydney or any place, even New York. when I am there somehow or another hall is full. Real Sahaja Yogis? Russians have some sort of emptiness within. I mean they are well off in a way, no poverty. Everyone married gets a house. Then the car is there; food is there. Don't have to work so hard. No struggle, nothing. Everything homemade. Now because of this change, also they have reached that stage of sagacity, I think they have given up these things. They have adapted it. That it is why all settled down this way. Now we have to change the method. For example, the government offer them 'you have your houses and we won't charge you pay rent'. They said no, no. You better keep and take from us rent, you have it.

Yogi: Here we will be happy to have this.

Shri Mataji: Here tax this and that; all kinds of problems. Everything looked after by the government (Russian); happy go lucky people and suddenly they have to look after themselves, they have to start their own, they are quite frightened. Alright whatever it is, we should say there is a very great number of people waiting for us. Then Bulgarians, and we went last to Romania. That was another place, absolutely tremendous people; very nice. In a way they are deeper than Russians, I would say in a way. They have more of 'bhakti' , devotion. Russians are more sort of they have sorted it out to that point that Mother is the Saviour. But these people are emotionally attached. It is a question of UNCLEAR, I should call these people and show the whole world.

Already we were in in the plane, we were going to Russia, Moscow, in the plane They found a magazine, My photograph all about My work everything is given. Some people's UNCLEAR given. (Shri Mataji asking a yogi) What magazine is that?

Yogi: Business USSR

Shri Mataji: In the plane in English, I was so surprised. Everybody started coming `give us Realization, give us Realization', in the plane. So that's how it is working out. 

(Shri Mataji looking at the yogis) Now we are all prepared for the program? You have advertised? 

Yogi: I show the advertisement.

Shri Mataji: Just I read an advertisement, that for Kundalini, for tantra this that. It is an advertisement. His name is Guru Wong.

Shri Mataji: Very nice ( Shri Mataji read the advertisement shown by yogi, Ng).

Yogi: Mother do you want to rest.

Shri Mataji: I think so. I will have my bath and rest. 

(Yogi showing an article about the program)

Shri Mataji: See the whole night they put the film before me and wouldn't allow us to sleep. I just don't know why. In five hours they showed two films. Everybody was complaining we want to sleep; we want to sleep. But, No. So sleepy. I will have a bath and sleep for a while.

Yogi: Can we say your Manthras. Can we say Three Great Manthras?

Shri Mataji: Alright please say. 

(Manthras recitation).

Shri Mataji: So, what time is the programme. Eight Clock?

Yogi: Eight'o Clock.

Shri Mataji: I hope you all will be there before that time. Is nobody going to translate?

Yogi: It will be in English.

Shri Mataji: Only in English? Only I speak. It's alright.

Yogi: Mr Shyam will give an introduction.

Shri Mataji: Yes, Yes, he can do so, opening. He must have gone to sleep also. Terrible really. The whole night playing films. I reach there a little later? Because if he speaks then I go after he has spoken.

Yogi: Then we start the 7.30 or so.

Shri Mataji: What time is the programme?

Yogi: Eight O' Clock.

Shri Mataji: Then eight O' clock you start the program. I should reach there by 8.30. Give me half an hour. Alright? May God Bless You.

Shri Mataji: I go without 'chappals' [sandals] [Yogi bringing Shri Mataji's sandals]. In the house it is alright. Lots of vibrations.
