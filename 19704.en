Talk to Sahaja Yogis in ashram Le Raincy.

Shri Mataji talks to a baby: Oh! What a nice place, it's beautiful for you. All right?
Shri Mataji: Hello!
[A Yogini garlands Shri Mataji.]
Thank you.
Ah! These are the one "lilas" [lilac], aren’t they? They are called as "lilas".
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: The light is all right Mother. It is not too much?
Shri Mataji:  Very fine.
[Shri Mataji about flowers on the tray for aarti]: Beautiful! You don’t get them in London. Beautiful!

Shri Mataji, aside: Hum, you don’t make him seat like that, he doesn’t like it. He wants to seat apart with Me.
Is this the lady who has come? All right come along, come along! Let her have a chair.
Good, good, good. Do come in, come in.
Sahaja Yogi: Shall I put a chair here Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes, here in front of Me.
It's very sweet of her. You tell her that I received her very sweet letter. I was very happy.
[The lady comes forward with a present] Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much, very kind. You can sit down, you can come. Yes come, come forward.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji dit qu’elle a reçu votre lettre. [Shri Mataji received your letter.]
Shri Mataji: I’m very thankful to her for the sweet letter, and I’m feeling happy that she has got all right because she is a good person.

Lady: Je suis enchantée de la rencontrer.
Sahaja Yogi: She is delighted to have met you.
Lady: Je suis très reconnaissante pour ce qu’elle a fait. [I am very thankful for what Shri Mataji did.]
[Shri Mataji takes her hand and kisses it.]
Sahaja Yogi: She is very grateful for what you have done.

Shri Mataji: Now, do you have people in Algeria who do all kinds of nonsensical things like black magic?
Lady: Ca a tendance à disparaître mais…
Gregoire: There is still, yes, in Algeria there, are still things like that.
Shri Mataji: You didn’t go to anyone like that?
Lady: Non, non, jamais. [No, no, never.]
Shri Mataji: But maybe out of jealousy, they've harmed.
Gregoire translates: I’ve never done any harm to anyone so I don’t know if somebody has done it
Shri Mataji laughs: …Jealousy…
Because Djamel had that effect, though, I mean, he didn’t get the same kind of troubles, but he had the same thing and he was amazed, you see.
A great personality.
[To a child]: Hello sir! What are you doing? Are you eating that?  Your father didn’t give you anything to eat?
[To the lady] Come forward, come forward. I’ll have to put my foot down there all right?
Just tell her in French.
Be comfortable, comfortable.
[Shri Mataji gives a kiss to a teddy bear, to a child]: Give this to the baby. Give this to the baby, all right? Go and kiss the baby, did you kiss the baby? Come along, where’s the baby? This is a baby’s doll.
Sahaja Yogi: She was frightened.
Shri Mataji: Now, she is all right, she was upset yesterday, I think she had a [?] on her.
“Vous fâchons…” [inaudible, in French]…
Gregoire, have you noticed his face is of a very different style? Gregoire's face.
Gregoire: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji [put her feet on another part of the lady's body]: Yes, now, better!
Do not feel guilty. And sit comfortably with both the hands on the floor.
All right. Just relax, all right?
[Cut in the video].

Shri Mataji [two babies are on her lap]: Ha, ha!
[The baby wants to stand] Ah, ah. What's that, what's that? Oh!

Again he wants to go.
Ah, I want to stand up, on top of the world, on top of the whole world! It’s his day.
Is it Sahaja Yogis' day? It is Sahaja Yogis' jealousy. Take him, take him.
You look so sweet both of you together, don’t you?
Again.
[Laughter.]
Shri Mataji: No, no, he can’t eat, he has no teeth, you eat, all right?
[Baby stands]
Ah, ah! Who is standing? Who is standing? Very busy man, very busy person. You see, Gregoire, their faces are so wide, did you notice that?
Gregoire: Yes Mother
Shri Mataji: They have wider faces.
Shri Mataji [plays with the children, the eldest laughs so loud that the baby is scared]
Shri Mataji: It doesn’t matter! No, no. It doesn’t matter! Ho, ho!
He gets frightened, you know.
Gregoire: Is he hungry or?

Shri Mataji: How is he with Brigit’s son?
Gregoire: They were very friendly, but Brigit’s son. But we were very worried for him  because with Brigit’s son gets some, he is very- has an Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Just take him.
So, what happened, Gregoire? What's happened with Brigit’s son?
What do you see vibration wise? Some Right and Left Nabbhi is there. So what happened with this? He got an Agnya from the father?
Gregoire: Yes, not only this, but his father told him so that now we know that whether he-
[Cut in the video.]
11:39

Shri Mataji: Your brother, has he been talking like that to her?
Gregoire: Yes,
Shri Mataji: For what?
Gregoire: He just told her that vibrations suggest that, if you go on like this, you say now, I am fed up. If you go on like this, I'll leave you and I will find a very nice husband [inaudible]. I mean, something like that for him to know that he should not go too far.
Shri Mataji: But what does he want her to do?
Gregoire: You see, Mother this-
Shri Mataji: Many things.
Gregoire: It's beyond understanding. Also, our parents, we don't even ask [inaudible] it's beyond and his mother is also like this.
Shri Mataji: He's very fond of his mother. I mean he's very much under her control.

Shri Mataji: I don't know if you have such laws here or not, but in India, any man who carries on with a married woman is punished by law for seven years. Would you like to say?
[Maries translates]
Shri Mataji: This law we've got it from English, of course now they don't believe in it. But I was amazed how they don't believe in such thnigs, I can't imagine.
Thank you.
So this is the case, that's what he had to establish such a system that time. But, it is not compulsory for you to marry.
