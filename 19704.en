Talk to Sahaja Yogis in ashram Le Raincy.

Shri Mataji talks to a baby: Oh! What a nice place, it's beautiful for you. All right?
Shri Mataji: Hello!
[A Yogini garlands Shri Mataji.]
Thank you.
Ah! These are the one "lilas" [lilac], aren’t they? They are called as "lilas".
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: The light is all right Mother. It is not too much?
Shri Mataji:  Very fine.
[Shri Mataji about flowers on the tray for aarti]: Beautiful! You don’t get them in London. Beautiful!

Shri Mataji, aside: Hum, you don’t make him seat like that, he doesn’t like it. He wants to seat apart with Me.
Is this the lady who has come? All right come along, come along! Let her have a chair.
Good, good, good. Do come in, come in.
Sahaja Yogi: Shall I put a chair here Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes, here in front of Me.
It's very sweet of her. You tell her that I received her very sweet letter. I was very happy.
[The lady comes forward with a present] Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much, very kind. You can sit down, you can come. Yes come, come forward.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji dit qu’elle a reçu votre lettre. [Shri Mataji received your letter.]
Shri Mataji: I’m very thankful to her for the sweet letter, and I’m feeling happy that she has got all right because she is a good person.

Lady: Je suis enchantée de la rencontrer.
Sahaja Yogi: She is delighted to have met you.
Lady: Je suis très reconnaissante pour ce qu’elle a fait. [I am very thankful for what Shri Mataji did.]
[Shri Mataji takes her hand and kisses it.]
Sahaja Yogi: She is very grateful for what you have done.

Shri Mataji: Now, do you have people in Algeria who do all kinds of nonsensical things like black magic?
Lady: Ca a tendance à disparaître mais…
Gregoire: There is still, yes, in Algeria, there are still things like that.
Shri Mataji: You didn’t go to anyone like that?
Lady: Non, non, jamais. [No, no, never.]
Shri Mataji: But maybe out of jealousy, they've harmed.
Gregoire translates: I’ve never done any harm to anyone so I don’t know if somebody has done it
Shri Mataji laughs: …Jealousy…
Because Djamel had that effect, though, I mean, he didn’t get the same kind of troubles, but he had the same thing and he was amazed, you see.
A great personality.
[To a child]: Hello sir! What are you doing? Are you eating that?  Your father didn’t give you anything to eat?
[To the lady] Come forward, come forward. I’ll have to put my foot down there all right?
Just tell her in French.
Be comfortable, comfortable.
[Shri Mataji gives a kiss to a teddy bear, to a child]: Give this to the baby. Give this to the baby, all right? Go and kiss the baby, did you kiss the baby? Come along, where’s the baby? This is a baby’s doll.
Sahaja Yogi: She was frightened.
Shri Mataji: Now, she is all right, she was upset yesterday, I think she had a [?] on her.
“Vous fâchons…” [inaudible, in French]…
Gregoire, have you noticed his face is of a very different style? Gregoire's face.
Gregoire: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji [put her feet on another part of the lady's body]: Yes, now, better!
Do not feel guilty. And sit comfortably with both the hands on the floor.
All right. Just relax, all right?
[Cut in the video].

Shri Mataji [two babies are on her lap]: Ha, ha!
[The baby wants to stand] Ah, ah. What's that, what's that? Oh!

Again he wants to go.
Ah, I want to stand up, on top of the world, on top of the whole world! It’s his day.
Is it Sahaja Yogis' day? It is Sahaja Yogis' jealousy. Take him, take him.
You look so sweet both of you together, don’t you?
Again.
[Laughter.]
Shri Mataji: No, no, he can’t eat, he has no teeth, you eat, all right?
[Baby stands]
Ah, ah! Who is standing? Who is standing? Very busy man, very busy person. You see, Gregoire, their faces are so wide, did you notice that?
Gregoire: Yes Mother
Shri Mataji: They have wider faces.
Shri Mataji [plays with the children, the eldest laughs so loud that the baby is scared]
Shri Mataji: It doesn’t matter! No, no. It doesn’t matter! Ho, ho!
He gets frightened, you know.
Gregoire: Is he hungry or?

Shri Mataji: How is he with Brigit’s son?
Gregoire: They were very friendly, but Brigit’s son. But we were very worried for him because with Brigit’s son gets some, he is very- has an Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Just take him.
So, what happened, Gregoire? What's happened with Brigit’s son?
What do you see vibration wise? Some Right and Left Nabbhi is there. So what happened with this? He got an Agnya from the father?
Gregoire: Yes, not only this but his father told him so that now we know that whether he-
[Cut in the video.]

Shri Mataji: Your brother, has he been talking like that to her?
Gregoire: Yes,
Shri Mataji: For what?
Gregoire: He just told her that vibrations suggest that, if you go on like this, you say now, I am fed up. If you go on like this, I'll leave you and I will find a very nice husband [inaudible]. I mean, something like that for him to know that he should not go too far.
Shri Mataji: But what does he want her to do?
Gregoire: You see, Mother this-
Shri Mataji: Many things.
Gregoire: It's beyond understanding. Also, our parents, we don't even ask [inaudible] it's beyond and his mother is also like this.
Shri Mataji: He's very fond of his mother. I mean he's very much under her control.

[Cut in the video].

Shri Mataji: I don't know if you have such laws here or not, but in India, any man who carries on with a married woman is punished by law for seven years. Would you like to say?
[Maries translates]
Shri Mataji: This law we've got it from English, of course now they don't believe in it. But I was amazed at how they don't believe in such things, I can't imagine.
Thank you.
So this was the case, that's why he had to establish such a system at that time. But it is not compulsory for you to marry four wives at all. So what Muslim don't understand is that if you have any relationship with any other woman, but a married woman, it's a sin according to Islam. [Inaudible], that's a fact, you see, but they don't mind having realtionships with other women, they don't live as saints, no!
My husband, who was in Ryad read an English paper in which all things had appeared and there was a big article on: "Where is our money going?" It's all lost in Paris and in London with the street women. Isn't it?
It's what it is that Islam, in essence, is for a complete recognition of marriage and the sanctity of marriage. But on the contrary, I think Muslims have missed the point. I think that it's a fundamental thing that he married even a little girl, you see, just to save her. Because in those days it was necessary, you see, for a girl – say- who was discarded by some people around and offended, this, that, he had to protect her and for that he married.
Like Krishna's case, you see. Krishna had his sixteen thousand powers and he got them, there were born in India as women. But he couldn't be keeping them in the house because everybody would say that they are his keeps. So he made one king captured them all these sixteen thousand and kept them in his house, you see, in his [?]. So Krishna defeated him and got hold of them and married them. And he had five elements also which tried to incarnate and then he married too as five wives, as queens. And he was called as Yogeshwara.
Gregoire: Mother, did you say that he married the five elements?
Shri Mataji: Five elements, it was his five wives, the five elements.
Gregoire: Who were they, Mother?
Shri Mataji: You see, they're five of them, Kalini and all, they are five, there's Rukmini and all these five. He had five queens. And after all, he was the Virata, you see? That's why he needed to have all these powers.
Can you give everyone one of these? Gavin, I think we should use those Indian sweets this afternoon.
Gavin: All right, Mother.
Shri Mataji: For lunch make sure that everyone gets one.
But he was Yogeshwara. He's called as the God of Yoga, means who is completely connected with the Spirit all the time.
And I told you the story about him that once his wives wanted to go and offer their homage to a saint who had to come on the other side of the river. Now this saint-
[Shri Mataji talks to the baby]
So when he went – when his ladies asked him that: "We want to go and meet the saint, the river is in flood. How do we cross?"
"It's very simple there's a mantra." He said that: "You go and say there, if Shri Krishna is a Yogeshwara, that means he has no wives at all, no relationship with any woman so far, then the river will go down."
Gregoire: Brahmacharya or Yogeshwara?
Shri Mataji: Brahmacharya, celibate.
They went and said that to the river and the river went down completely and they could walk through because river is the water: it understands dharma.
So, they worshipped the saint and when they were coming back, you see - they gave lots of food for him to eat and he ate a lot of food and they looked after him. And when they were coming back, again the river was in spate. So they went to the saint and asked him: "What should we do now?"
So the saint said: "How did you come?" So they said: "We told some absurd thing to the river, saying that Shri Krishna is a celibate king but we are all his wives and we know he is not. But then the river receded." So he said: "All right, now you go and tell the river that I have not eaten even one single particle of food all my life. Go and tell the river. Not even tasted, not even tasted!"
So they went down and told the river that: "This fellow, if he has not eaten even a single particle, if he has not tasted even a single particle of food, then you'd better go down."
So the river went down.
[Inaudible], they are all absurd people. So, for God, there is nothing like sin because whatever is against God is a sin. Whatever God does is not sin. If he wants to kill he can kill any number. He can have wives, husbands. Now, in these days the population can have many children. God, he can have!
But they indicate a certain kind of mood of life just deliberately because they want people to follow that mood, [Inaudible] of people.
I can take up all your money, property, everything, it's fine, what is there? The whole world's property I can take up. But I should follow a certain amount of mood of life to show the way you should lead your life. Because you see, I don't need any help but you do.
So, this is all the drama.
