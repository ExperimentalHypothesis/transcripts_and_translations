Talk to Sahaja Yogis in ashram Le Raincy.

Shri Mataji talks to a baby: Oh! What a nice place, it's beautiful for you. All right?
Shri Mataji: Hello!
[A Yogini garlands Shri Mataji.]
Thank you.
Ah! These are the one "lilas" [lilac], aren’t they? They are called as "lilas".
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: The light is all right Mother. It is not too much?
Shri Mataji: Very fine.
[Shri Mataji about flowers on the tray for aarti]: Beautiful! You don’t get them in London. Beautiful!

Shri Mataji, aside: Hum, you don’t make him seat like that, he doesn’t like it. He wants to seat apart with Me.
Is this the lady who has come? All right come along, come along! Let her have a chair.
Good, good, good. Do come in, come in.
Sahaja Yogi: Shall I put a chair here Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes, here in front of Me.
It's very sweet of her. You tell her that I received her very sweet letter. I was very happy.
[The lady comes forward with a present] Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much, very kind. You can sit down, you can come. Yes come, come forward.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji dit qu’elle a reçu votre lettre. [Shri Mataji received your letter.]
Shri Mataji: I’m very thankful to her for the sweet letter, and I’m feeling happy that she has got all right because she is a good person.

Lady: Je suis enchantée de la rencontrer.
Sahaja Yogi: She is delighted to have met you.
Lady: Je suis très reconnaissante pour ce qu’elle a fait. [I am very thankful for what Shri Mataji did.]
[Shri Mataji takes her hand and kisses it.]
Sahaja Yogi: She is very grateful for what you have done.

Shri Mataji: Now, do you have people in Algeria who do all kinds of nonsensical things like black magic?
Lady: Ca a tendance à disparaître mais...
Gregoire: There is still, yes, in Algeria, there are still things like that.
Shri Mataji: You didn’t go to anyone like that?
Lady: Non, non, jamais. [No, no, never.]
Shri Mataji: But maybe out of jealousy, they've harmed.
Gregoire translates: I’ve never done any harm to anyone so I don’t know if somebody has done it
Shri Mataji laughs: ...Jealousy...
Because Djamel had that effect, though, I mean, he didn’t get the same kind of troubles, but he had the same thing and he was amazed, you see.
A great personality.
[To a child]: Hello sir! What are you doing? Are you eating that? Your father didn’t give you anything to eat?
[To the lady] Come forward, come forward. I’ll have to put my foot down there all right?
Just tell her in French.
Be comfortable, comfortable.
[Shri Mataji gives a kiss to a teddy bear, to a child]: Give this to the baby. Give this to the baby, all right? Go and kiss the baby, did you kiss the baby? Come along, where’s the baby? This is a baby’s doll.
Sahaja Yogi: She was frightened.
Shri Mataji: Now, she is all right, she was upset yesterday, I think she had a [ ?] on her.
“Vous fâchons...” [inaudible, in French]...
Gregoire, have you noticed his face is of a very different style? Gregoire's face.
Gregoire: Yes Mother.

Shri Mataji [put her feet on another part of the lady's body]: Yes, now, better!
Do not feel guilty. And sit comfortably with both the hands on the floor.
All right. Just relax, all right?
[Cut in the video].

Shri Mataji [two babies are on her lap]: Ha, ha!
[The baby wants to stand] Ah, ah. What's that, what's that? Oh!

Again he wants to go.
Ah, I want to stand up, on top of the world, on top of the whole world! It’s his day.
Is it Sahaja Yogis' day? It is Sahaja Yogis' jealousy. Take him, take him.
You look so sweet both of you together, don’t you?
Again.
[Laughter.]
Shri Mataji: No, no, he can’t eat, he has no teeth, you eat, all right?
[Baby stands]
Ah, ah! Who is standing? Who is standing? Very busy man, very busy person. You see, Gregoire, their faces are so wide, did you notice that?
Gregoire: Yes Mother
Shri Mataji: They have wider faces.
Shri Mataji [plays with the children, the eldest laughs so loud that the baby is scared]
Shri Mataji: It doesn’t matter! No, no. It doesn’t matter! Ho, ho!
He gets frightened, you know.
Gregoire: Is he hungry or?

Shri Mataji: How is he with Brigit’s son?
Gregoire: They were very friendly, but Brigit’s son. But we were very worried for him because with Brigit’s son gets some, he is very- has an Agnya.

Shri Mataji: Just take him.
So, what happened, Gregoire? What's happened with Brigit’s son?
What do you see vibration wise? Some Right and Left Nabbhi is there. So what happened with this? He got an Agnya from the father?
Gregoire: Yes, not only this but his father told him so that now we know that whether he-
[Cut in the video.]

Shri Mataji: Your brother, has he been talking like that to her?
Gregoire: Yes,
Shri Mataji: For what?
Gregoire: He just told her that vibrations suggest that, if you go on like this, you say now, I am fed up. If you go on like this, I'll leave you and I will find a very nice husband [inaudible]. I mean, something like that for him to know that he should not go too far.
Shri Mataji: But what does he want her to do?
Gregoire: You see, Mother this-
Shri Mataji: Many things.
Gregoire: It's beyond understanding. Also, our parents, we don't even ask [inaudible] it's beyond and his mother is also like this.
Shri Mataji: He's very fond of his mother. I mean he's very much under her control.

[...]

[Cut in the video].

Shri Mataji: I don't know if you have such laws here or not, but in India, any man who carries on with a married woman is punished by law for seven years. Would you like to say?
[Marie translates]
Shri Mataji: This law we've got it from English, of course now they don't believe in it. But I was amazed at how they don't believe in such things, I can't imagine.
Thank you.
So this was the case, that's why he had to establish such a system at that time. But it is not compulsory for you to marry four wives at all. So what Muslim don't understand is that if you have any relationship with any other woman, but a married woman, it's a sin according to Islam. [Inaudible], that's a fact, you see, but they don't mind having relationships with other women, they don't live as saints, no!
My husband, who was in Ryad read an English paper in which all things had appeared and there was a big article on: "Where is our money going?" It's all lost in Paris and in London with the street women. Isn't it?
It's what it is that Islam, in essence, is for a complete recognition of marriage and the sanctity of marriage. But on the contrary, I think Muslims have missed the point. I think that it's a fundamental thing that he married even a little girl, you see, just to save her. Because in those days it was necessary, you see, for a girl – say- who was discarded by some people around and offended, this, that, he had to protect her and for that he married.
Like Krishna's case, you see. Krishna had his sixteen thousand powers and he got them, there were born in India as women. But he couldn't be keeping them in the house because everybody would say that they are his keeps. So he made one king captured them all these sixteen thousand and kept them in his house, you see, in his [?]. So Krishna defeated him and got hold of them and married them. And he had five elements also which tried to incarnate and then he married too as five wives, as queens. And he was called as Yogeshwara.
Gregoire: Mother, did you say that he married the five elements?
Shri Mataji: Five elements, it was his five wives, the five elements.
Gregoire: Who were they, Mother?
Shri Mataji: You see, they're five of them, Kalini and all, they are five, there's Rukmini and all these five. He had five queens. And after all, he was the Virata, you see? That's why he needed to have all these powers.
Can you give everyone one of these? Gavin, I think we should use those Indian sweets this afternoon.
Gavin: All right, Mother.
Shri Mataji: For lunch make sure that everyone gets one.
But he was Yogeshwara. He's called as the God of Yoga, means who is completely connected with the Spirit all the time.
And I told you the story about him that once his wives wanted to go and offer their homage to a saint who had to come on the other side of the river. Now this saint-
[Shri Mataji talks to the baby]
So when he went – when his ladies asked him that: "We want to go and meet the saint, the river is in flood. How do we cross?"
"It's very simple there's a mantra." He said that: "You go and say there, if Shri Krishna is a Yogeshwara, that means he has no wives at all, no relationship with any woman so far, then the river will go down."
Gregoire: Brahmacharya or Yogeshwara?
Shri Mataji: Brahmacharya, celibate.
They went and said that to the river and the river went down completely and they could walk through because river is the water: it understands dharma.
So, they worshiped the saint and when they were coming back, you see - they gave lots of food for him to eat and he ate a lot of food and they looked after him. And when they were coming back, again the river was in spate. So they went to the saint and asked him: "What should we do now?"
So the saint said: "How did you come?" So they said: "We told some absurd thing to the river, saying that Shri Krishna is a celibate king but we are all his wives and we know he is not. But then the river receded." So he said: "All right, now you go and tell the river that I have not eaten even one single particle of food all my life. Go and tell the river. Not even tasted, not even tasted!"
So they went down and told the river that: "This fellow, if he has not eaten even a single particle, if he has not tasted even a single particle of food, then you'd better go down."
So the river went down.
[Inaudible], they are all absurd people. So, for God, there is nothing like sin because whatever is against God is a sin. Whatever God does is not sin. If he wants to kill he can kill any number. He can have wives, husbands. Now, in these days the population can have many children. God, he can have!
But they indicate a certain kind of mood of life just deliberately because they want people to follow that mood, [Inaudible] of people.
I can take up all your money, property, everything, it's fine, what is there? The whole world's property I can take up. But I should follow a certain amount of mood of life to show the way you should lead your life. Because you see, I don't need any help but you do.
So, this is all the drama.

Hello, how are you? Why don't you just sit down? [Inaudible] He has been busy cooking and do all the work for you only.

Gregoire: He is busy with journalists, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: What's that? Are they coming?

Gregoire: One is there. One is coming to the program this evening, one journalist, and one is probably, the one who was on the phone is probably coming to the program tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: Very kind of them.

[Laughter].

Shri Mataji: It's all right. [Inaudible]. They are all like that [Inaudible]

Ruined people. You see, something serious has to happen, then they will be all right, to their newspapers.

A gentleman like this Murdoch [owner of The Times], horrible fellow, the name itself "Murdoch" you see "Murd" means, in English language, is "dead", dog, "dead dog". And this one is in charge of the whole of that. He's the one who has purchased Times. How many of this in England, Patty? 

Patty: And a lot of the Australian papers.

Shri Mataji: How many Indians purchase now? Like since.

But in Australia, his friend was the one who was cured with Sahaja Yoga and he had cancer. But I don't know if it was his friend or his friend's friend, but somebody related to this Dead Dog.

[Laughter].

He's very licencious and he's a very horrible fellow, he's a horrible man, extremely adharmic.

She's better?

Shri Mataji: Still some Vishuddhi Mother.

Shri Mataji: Don't feel guilty, for what do you feel guilty? Because God is very patient you must give it some time. You cannot do anything which is so big, bigger than the ocean of love. [Unsure]

[Cut in the audio]

There's a- you see, the head of this perversion.

Why don't you come here? Take a chair. Take one for him.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I would like to give you, this is a present.

Shri Mataji: Presents.

Sahaja Yogi: I had to make it for a school. It was a project. [Inaudible.] I wrote about Sahaja Yoga and its inspiration for arts.

Shri Mataji: I see. And then, this is the thesis. About what? About Sahaja Yoga?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes. That's, it's the source of all painting and art. I tried to write it for people that are waiting for You in the world of art. [Unsure]

So, sometimes You may feel it's a bit catching here [at Hamsa chakra].

[Shri Mataji is laughing. She is reading the booklet]

Shri Mataji: First time people make [inaudible]

You see, there was a gentleman who was the chairman of the Muhler [?] and Company, very great company they have, very big company. [inaudible]

And he met Me, no more now. He was the first who met Me in 1965. He was very much in the Sahaja Yoga and I think he was the first Dutch who may talk about Sahaja Yoga. He was very much interested. But [inaudible]

Sahaja Yogi: I think in Holland, many people seek. They take [inaudible]

Shri Mataji: Of course, they are very [inaudible]. We had one, that is – what's his name that one?

Sahaja Yogi: Gavin.

Shri Mataji: Gavin, Gavin, he stays there. We should get him the address from this lady.

Sahaja Yogi: She's French?

Shri Mataji: She's a Dutch lady.

Sahaja Yogi: She's English I think.

Gregoire: She's French.

Shri Mataji: She's French married with a Dutch.

Sahaja Yogi: And she lives in Holland.

Shri Mataji: She now lives in England but her son Gavin lives with the father. And he was telling Me that Dutch may not be seeking. They are very much crooked [unsure]. He said they drink, this, that- very bad. And about his father [inaudible] like any other Dutch father who drinks too much.

Sahaja Yogi: It's silly.

Shri Mataji: He is in Holland, not in Belgium. But the gentleman whom I met was also in Holland.

Doctor Nagansey [unsure] is very [inaudible] isn't he? He's a Realized soul. But these people are [inaudible]

They lack collectivity all of them.

Marie: Realized souls or?

Shri Mataji: No, no, no. This doctor Nagansey is the chairman of the High Court.

Gregoire: De la Cour de justice internationale. [International Court of Justice]

Shri Mataji: Yes. He got his Realization and he helped Me because he was the secretary of the President, I mean it's the topmost job we have in India for all the civil servants. Ad he got Me this land. I mean he just helped Me to get the land and all that he talked about. But, I mean in collectivity they do not, they won't come to the programs and things like that, but they should be. 

Otherwise, he's a very nice man, he got his Realization. He sent his wife to Me to get Realization. Let them come in, please can you come forward?

[Talking about some ladies]

Shri Mataji: And what about the other speaker who came between the last time?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, he has some difficulties to leave Algeria because this year we are changing all passports. [...] After March, the passports will not be valid any longer You know.

Shri Mataji: [inaudible].

Sahaja Yogi: You have to apply,

Shri Mataji: For a new one.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, so he could not come this time. You see? But few of them are quite well. That old man, he's OK as I told You in London last time. He has problems with his right neck. But the others, especially the small one, they will get any problems, it's normal of course.

Shri Mataji: It's all right.

Sahaja Yogi: It's quite all right, now there is the little sister, the smaller one. [Inaudible.]

Shri Mataji: What about Morocco, what do think? Morocco could be a prior place to move in. Morocco, there is democracy or same style?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, it's not a democracy. It's not reactional. There are lays of the population that might be [Inaudible.] Tunisia would be a more opened society.

Shri Mataji: How far is Tunisia from Algeria?

Sahaja Yogi: Well, about 800 kilometers from the capitals.

Shri Mataji: It's not very far. About a thousand miles

Sahaja Yogi: In North African, all these three countries are pretty close, they share borders together [inaudible].

Shri Mataji: I mean, I was thinking, we should have a center somewhere there in one of these countries where it is rather free, where one can start, and for those people who are, say, in Algeria, in all such places where they are not so free, they can come down easily. You see, for them to get passports and to move on to Tunisia than to be in Paris perhaps, would be easier. 

Sahaja Yogi: Right. It's near, you can drive from Algeria.

Shri Mataji: And Tunisia won't have, and Tunisia's government won't have so much objections to their coming in I think. Like Moroccans and Algerians, all those.

Sahaja Yogi: No the relations are very good among them.

Shri Mataji: They will not have problems.

I think Djamel's mother comes from Tunisia.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: He has been always telling Me about Tunisia. According to him, Tunisia would be the best place to start a centre.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Tunisians are very open-minded.

Shri Mataji: Yes. So, should we keep it for next year? To start a center in Tunisia somehow.

Sahaja Yogi: That would be a better idea yes.

Shri Mataji: Then people can come from Algeria to Tunisia, and get their Realization.

Sahaja Yogi: Sure.

[One lady is massaging the right leg of Shri Mataji]

Shri Mataji: They almost got the light, isn't it? No government to stop the light [inaudible].But the fundamentalists must be dropped down, you see, they have to be pulled out of the West. They'll be ruining everything, they are ruining everyone. Now if you are reading the Koran, I must say that there is more accent is on the day of Resurrection, more accent is on the day of Resurrection than the day of Ruhr. And the day of Judgment and the day of Resurrection is very important. I mean they are preparing it, the whole Koran itself is preparing you for this day of Judgment.

Somebody has to talk about it.

Now the main thing why Muhammad sahib or anyone did not talk so much about Me in person or description of Me or the One who will give you knowledge is on the day of Resurrection - it's written that you will know God better, that you will know the knowledge and all those things are written very clearly. The reason was that it was some sort of a security when you haven't seen, so that it should not direct all the negativity towards Me when I come here and life should be easier for Me because if they come to know that I am the One who is coming for this, then the whole of Mullah they will be going on my head.

[Shri Mataji is laughing] So just he wanted to hide the things. Apart from that, I think, after Realization, I can convince you. That is one of the reasons it was not so clearly said.

Indians have an advantage on others because it's already described what to expect from a person who is coming for this sake. So for them, it is very easy to recognize because there are all the names all the descriptions, everything is there.

I must say English are also specially very much endowed because of Blake. Blake, I mean, he has written about Me, it's really remarkable. Even the house now that we have bought now. He has written about that, about that house, the Golden builders and everything. 

Sahaja Yogi: How?

Shri Mataji: In the house itself, you'll be amazed, the house will be- he has written the house will be- Can you get that, it's a very good one. She has brought it upstairs, in my room. 

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: That's in my room upstairs. Can you go and get it from Mathias you can see, it is in the, I saw it in the cupboards.

He has written about a house near Kensington Gardens, it's near that brook, you see, it just passes through the house, I mean it's an under thing on top of that all the houses are built. What's the brook's name Gavin? Tyburn? 

Gavin: Tyburn, Tyburn.

Shri Mataji: Tyburn.

And he said that the Golden builders - because when the house was all done and all, actually these Sahaja Yogis went and painted it all these garnishes with gold. It's the Golden builders there were called as Golden, beautifully done. So many things! But one of these things is so remarkable, he said we will discover this.

Shri Mataji: Should you have your breakfast all of you?

Even Rome had some signs when I went there the key of the Roman- this thing- church which is kept there as symbol of – the key was given [inaudible] according to these Christians, you see, [inaudible] and that is symbolized as a - they have made a monument for that key and all that. The thing felt down. So many symbols felt down there before I went there.

And there's a gentleman [inaudible] had Realization before, but the trouble with him is that he doesn't know he has got Realization. Tell him to come in, he's a new one I don't know if you can find him. [Unsure]

Sahaja Yogi: These are only pictures of Blake Mother.

Shri Mataji: Not the book?

Sahaja Yogi: Nineteen.

Shri Mataji: Not the book of Blake.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Bernard you have got?

Sahaja Yogi: Pamela has got the book in her car and she's going to pick it up for them.

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible, about giving Realization to an Indian man]

Shri Mataji: You can ask him.

[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: But what did [Inaudible]

What I would just say is why did we believe in them? Why in Muhammad? Say, it's all over because I'm that, I am.

Why do we believe?

I am just asking a simple question because I'm all that, but I am just asking.

You see, just before this person has been cured by Me, you've not seen The Virgin curing anybody. [Unsure]. And they didn't see Muhammad, they didn't see Krishna, they didn't see anyone. I gave you Realization, not Virgin Mary. So why do we believe in Virgin Mary more, and in Christ and Muhammad, all of them?

Now, I am before you. When they came, nobody believed in them either. Like, when Muhammad came they said we believe in Moses. When Moses came they said we believe in Abraham. So, we are believing always in the past. We have never met them. We have never seen them. They have not given us Realization. They have not given us any knowledge, this Divine understanding of God's Power. Then, why do we believe? What we see, what we can feel in the present, that's what we should be. All right? But it's the human nature, it wants to escape the present and live with the past or with the future. Or these stupid Jews still [think] somebody is going to come to redeem them. And for the stupid Christians, Christ has come and nobody is going to come. And when he has said: “I will send you a Comforter.” So, what about that? 

And imagine a combination of a Comforter and a Redeemer and a Counselor. Tremendous job! Christ has not given Realization to anyone, nobody was ready for that. All these churches and all these people who talk of any of other religion are nothing but money-making propositions. All advertising agencies. It is an advertisement that doesn't give any goods.

[Shri Mataji is laughing.] All artificial and imaginary. The reality lies in the present.

There's another thing why we don't believe in the present because we don't believe in ourselves sometimes that we are endowed with the power to know God. We don't feel confident about ourselves that: "Why not we, in this lifetime, know God?" That means only the people who came at the time of Christ - who never recognized him - are the only ones who are saved and the rest are all finished. It is like recognizing the seed and not the fruit. All right? May God bless you.

So be in the present, this is the counseling part of Me. And Realization is the redemption part and curing is the comforting part.

Ah, Realized! [About the new person]

Like yesterday one fellow who would just believe in Christ, he wouldn't get his Realization. I said, what to do with this fellow, I didn't see! [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

Like somebody sitting outside that: “I must have my food here and not in the kitchen like other staff, you see?” Absolute nonsense!

If Christ had done, it would be all right, but he did not tell it. He left it to Me. So, why do they want to use him because they can take advantage of this kind of a transition that is between Me and him at this time and that time. Myself, I'm the transition myself of myself. But stupid as they are, they can only make some money or fanaticism or some quarrellings, some hatred. They are not to give you anything. They are all fighting among themselves. All the Muslims are fighting among themselves, all the Christians fighting among themselves, all Hindus fighting among themselves.

[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

How they believe in one thing that is God? If it is fundamentally one thing you are talking about, then how can you have different visions? If that one thing is the Absolute, all of you should feel the same way? As long as you are blind, you will go about like that. 

And they will- they have told you that the day will come that you'll know the knowledge and it will happen. Nobody talks about it. They talk about the past only. And only the Jews who talk about it and postpone permanently. [Shri Mataji is laughing.] They'll never want to accept it at all. They will never accept because then all of them will have to accept the reality. So, thanks to God at least now they don't say they have to suffer. They have learned a little lesson. 

What about you people you having something to eat?

Sahaja Yogi: They are starting Mother.

Shri Mataji: That's the present now.

Who has been cooking?

Marie: It's a mixture of everybody's cooking.

Shri Mataji: Did they?

Sahaja Yogi: Before You came, Mother, we have been cooking.

Marie: This is the weekend before. [Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: You put it in the freezer. And then you have permutations and combinations.

Marie: We spent the whole day in the kitchen peeling vegetables.

[Cut in the video while Shri Mataji is eating]

Shri Mataji: ...So the mother brought him. So I put the child, that's how Indians take a child, [unsure] just like this, it's very comfortable. He was there for a while. So he said that: “Mummy never takes me in her arms. Mummy never kisses me. [Inaudible]

He said: “My mother has never done that to me”. I don't remember, my mother has never touched me, has never done that to me. I asked her: “Why don't you do that?” She said because I'll develop a guilt according to Freud. Can you imagine? A guilt with your own child. If you embrace your eight years old child you'll develop a guilt in America. Really stupid women. For a mother, to say like that! Imagine! For a eight years old child.

They trained up like that, they grew up like that, all these ideas are coming from this horrible psychologist. No doubt, what she said is true. And they have to exist and they must create such a world, creating psychological cases.

If you are studying even psychology you can talk with Peter. Can you believe it? [Shri Mataji is laughing.] Left Swadishthana, they will all get cancers I think but the time it's over. They all catch [Shri Mataji shows the Left Swadishthan.] They have been all anti-God.

I hope that you have more sensible girls like you in this country, France.

Sahaja Yogini: I hope so. Because I have in my family, my brother is in psychoanalyze and also my sister.

Shri Mataji: Psychologist?

Sahaja Yogini: No, psychoanalyze.

Maire: They are having a psychoanalyze. Both the brother and the sister.

Shri Mataji: It's a fashion, it seems, it's a fashion here.

Sahaja Yogini: For me, it was not really expensive but my brother is young it's my parents who are paying.

Shri Mataji: Why?

Sahaja Yogini: Because he had bad friends, he 's not very young, nearly twenty.

Marie: 2 hundred francs for half an hour.

[Cut in the video]

Gregoire: “Institut de psychanalyse de Paris” mardini.

[Laughter.]

[Sahaja Yogis repeat it 7 times]

Shri Mataji: You have a big institution here?

Sahaja Yogi: Not any more. [Big laughter.]

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Gregoire: Gavin said “not any more”.

[Big laughter.]

Sahaja Yogini (new): She is in psychoanalyze for five years. She is studying psychology to become a psychoanalyst. She works all the time. Yesterday, she started to have a stomach ulcer. And I tell her “keep cool, you work too much”. 

Shri Mataji: Did she come to Sahaja Yoga?

Sahaja Yogini: She is against it.

Shri Mataji: Why?

Sahaja Yogini: I don't know.

Shri Mataji: So you don't have to pay for her.

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I don't know, I will try.

Marie: She is possessed by Freud. There is only Freud, horrible! He is against tradition.

Shri Mataji: She's very much there, she's a very wise French girl.

You have to know that you are very wise.

Sahaja Yogi: [In French: he is very materialistic and has turned her away from tradition] I saw that since a week, before I was in the dark. Nos she is having a stomach ulcer and she is only thirty.

Shri Mataji: Something wrong with her.

But I think psychologists, because it's the New Age, they are models.

[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: You see, one thing that they don't understand that you can die out of cancer. He had a very bad family life, the relationships with his family was horrible because he was having relations before with his mother [unsure]. Such a wretched man, what can he teach you? He himself had a life of such a low level. What can he teach you?

Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] In that way, it's a kind of hypnotism. At twenty years, the sweet girls and boys, they worship their teachers.

[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: But one criteria, you tell them, one criteria is this, what power have you got? And how much you can discriminate? If you have got the light then you should be able to see through yourself and another person. Or it could be just ego pampering, you know. Or maybe that it is a kind of a thing that plays upon your weaknesses. So one has to tell them that how much powerful that you have become? 

And if you have a car for example. And you have the brake and the accelerator. Now, you learn to know how to handle these two things, then you become the driver. You do not become a driver if there is a car standing before you or you are like a policeman handling all the cars with your hands, you see. You don't become a driver if you are just standing on the roadside and giving ways to the traffic only. Only you become the driver when you know how to use your accelerator and your brake. And then, you become the master of that when you are just automatically doing it. And you see yourself, your body, your mind and everything, as your servants. That means you become the master of your body, the master of your mind, the master of your intellect and master of everything that you have. So they cannot enslave you. All these habits come to you to enslave you. So you must ask them to find out: “How much mastery have you achieved?” This is what it is.

So when you talk to them, you should say: “But, it's just, to feel for somebody who is just worshiped [inaudible] this and that, but what have you got yourself?”But with Sahaja Yoga, you become a guru yourself, a master. You get the power with whom you can overcome any such temptations. This is what you have to talk to them. Just running after somebody like a crowd or like a mass or you can say, like a herd, what is the sense? What have you got yourself, what has happened to your awareness? One should face it directly and not to escape into something that just believes there's something great, it's imaginary. 

Sahaja Yogi: But they answer sometimes if the cool breeze could be imaginary, psychologically?

Shri Mataji: No, it cannot be. Because I tell you why it is thought because it has cured people of cancer. With the naked eyes, you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini. You can photograph it. He has got it in his video, the pulsation of the Kundalini. Also, you can take photographs of vibrations.
