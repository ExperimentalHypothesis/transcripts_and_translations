Public Program. Hong Kong (China), 22 April 1994.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that Truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot conceptualize it. Unfortunately, we cannot also know it with this human awareness. Now whatever, I’m going to tell you, you need not believe in blindfolded. We have already suffered a lot by believing things blindfolded. We must keep, our mind open like scientist, and whatever I am telling you should be treated like a hypothesis. But if it is accepted, blindfolded it is of no use. But if it is proved, then, you have to accept it as honest people. Because it is for the benevolence of your being. It is for the benevolence of your family, your country, and above all, it is, for the benevolence of the whole world.

Most of the problems, of this world come from human beings. And, human beings have their problems when these centers are out of gear. All your physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, political, economic...every sort of problem comes from the same. Some come from collective mistakes, but they all originate here within yourself. Now, this subtle center exist, within every human being, whether you’re Chinese, Japanese, Indian, anything. And this power of Kundalini, resides, in the, triangular bone which we call as ‘Sacrum.’ That means that, the Greeks knew that this was a sacred bone since long.

The real Truth is that, you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, intelligence, ego or conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit. We see these beautiful flowers, it’s a miracle! We never even think how, they come up in different colors, hides, fragrance. We never bother to know about the living process. Who runs our heart? We ask the doctor he will say: ‘It is autonomous nervous system.’ But who is this ‘auto’? So we don’t, want to know anything about, the miracle of living process. It is done, by, a very subtle, powerful, dynamic, energy. It’s a power of Divine Love. In different religions it is called by different names. But unfortunately, religions, were never Spirit oriented. In the beginning may have been, but later on they drifted and became money oriented or power oriented. It was absolutely wrong to become money oriented in the Name of God. God doesn’t understand money. How much do we pay, to this Mother Earth, to get these flowers? She doesn’t understand money, She doesn’t understand banking. So the first and foremost thing we have to know: for the living process you cannot pay. We have not payed anything for our evolutionary process. So, for the evolution you are not, to pay anything, it is absurd! But so many ignorant ideas, came up, through blind faith. As a result of this happening, when the Kundalini rises, She passes through six centers and pierces, through the last one here: fontanel bone area. Thus She connects you to this All-Pervading Power and your Spirit starts, enlightening your attention. This happening takes place, and for the first time you can feel this All-Pervading Power on your fingertips as cool breeze. Once you are connected, you become, so powerful, with your enlightenment, that, you are surprised at yourself. Now if this [microphone] instrument is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. In the same way if you are not connected to the mains, then you have no identity. People paint their heads and wear funny dresses, they think they are expressing their identity. Identity is within yourself.

With this happening, first thing that happens to you, that you become very peaceful. The modern disease of stress and strain goes away. Especially in this Hong Kong I find has problems: working so hard and, sometimes it ends up into big problems. So what happens that we are all the time thinking about the future or the past. We cannot be in the present which is the reality. So one thought rises, falls off, another thought rises, falls off, and we are jumping on the cusps of these thoughts. But when the Kundalini rises then these thoughts elongate, and your attention stops, at the present which is the pause between the two thoughts. That is what you are: the source of peace. That’s how you become peaceful. You cannot do meditation, but this is how you are in meditation, absolutely at peace with yourself. Then the whole world, will look, as if it is a drama, and you are the witness of that drama. I’ve seen many people, who have got awards for peace, they have foundations for peace, big organizations for peace. But they have no peace within. They are extremely hot-tempered people, and if you have to go near them, you have to take a [UNCLEAR]. Such people, how can they create peace? Thus, this peace within yourself makes you, thoughtlessly aware. You are thoughtless, but you are aware, and you are in the present. And as I said: in the present is the reality.

When you have problems, you are, as in, in the waves of very high waters. But somehow, if you can get onto a boat, you can see those waves and enjoy them. So you can see the problems yourself and then you can easily solve them. Your attention itself, becomes enlightened. Gradually, you see things, clearly. But this attention is enlightened, so your attention becomes pure. There is no lust and greed in your attention, as Christ has said: “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.” It happens, that your eyes become extremely innocent and there is a tingling of light in your eyes. And such a person, if he glances, at anyone or even pays attention to anyone, he can help him in many ways. Your memory improves, and you become extremely dynamic. At the same time, you become extremely compassionate.

It is surprising, we develop so many of our qualities and talents which we were never aware of. I’ve known of so many people in Sahaja Yoga they came, and after coming to Sahaja Yoga they have become now world-famous musicians and artist. They have achieved great heights but, they have no ego. They are extremely, extremely humble, and suddenly they have become very righteous people.

You may be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian...any community, any religion, but you can commit any sin. And this sin you can commit, despite the fact you may say ‘I am this fanatic, that fanatic,’ that means religion has done nothing good to you! But after Self-Realization, you really become a righteous person. A Christian becomes a real Christian, a Buddhist a real Buddhist, Hindu a real Hindu. All these powers are within you, of which you are not aware. Only, the trouble is that you have, to have a pure desire to get your Self-Realization. All other desires are not pure, because, one desire is fulfilled you ask for another. It is not satiable, in general as said by economics. So this is the pure desire you have, of which you may be aware, or may not be aware. And unless and until this is fulfilled, you are not going to be satisfied with yourself.

Another thing that happens to you which is very remarkable, that you know the absolute truth on your fingertips. I’ve seen people get befooled by somebody who says ‘I am such and such, I am such and such.’ There are many false people who have befooled you and have made money out of you, also they have mesmerized you, also they have spoiled your Kundalini, so how will you know, that the person is false or true? You can feel it on your fingertips. You can know it on your fingertips, what sort of a person that one is. Many people who don’t believe in God. I think it is very unscientific. First one should find out, and then decide. But through Sahaja Yoga you can find out. Everything is tangible it’s not just a lecture or a sermon it is tangible. For example, in Delhi there are three doctors who got their MD in Sahaja Yoga for curing many diseases. And it is your own power which does the job. It’s only you who gains it, so there is no, obligation of anyone.

Above all, you jump into the Ocean of Joy. That means, it’s not like happiness and unhappiness. If your ego is pampered, you feel happy. If it is punctured, you feel unhappy. But I’m talking about joy, which is absolute, and you jump into the Ocean of Joy.

In this short lecture, I’m sorry, I won’t be able to tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga. And one has to be, little patient with one’s self, because this is the ultimate that you have to achieve, otherwise your personality has no meaning, it has no purpose.

The highest thing that happens is that you achieve a new dimension which we call as Collective Consciousness. That is: on your fingertips, you can feel another person. You can find out what’s wrong with another person. Not only that you know about yourself, the self-knowledge, what’s wrong with you, but you know about others. If you know how to correct your centers and that of others, you solve the problem. But Sahaja Yoga is not meant for frivolous people or for idiots. I’m sorry, one has to understand that this is so important for the world to change, and if you want to have your Self-Realization, you must know how important you are to be born at this time when, I call it, a Blossom Time. This is The Last Judgement; your Kundalini will judge. This is The Resurrection Time, Khyaama, which Mohammad Saheb has described in the Qur’an, that: ‘At the time of Khyaama, your hands will speak.’

I know you have some questions, but I have to tell you one thing, that, I have now been doing this work for the last twenty-five years. And I know all kind of questions that people ask. And I’m too clever I can answer all of them, but it’s a mental [UNCLEAR]. What you should get: your Self-Realization and Self-Knowledge, but still if you have questions after that, you may write to me.

It will hardly take about ten to fifteen minutes, to get your Self-Realization, it’s all built in within you. But, there are three conditions that you have to follow. The first condition is that you are not to feel guilty, because, if you feel guilty, it’s a myth. If you make mistakes alright face it, but don’t feel guilty because you spoil this side [Left Vishuddhi] of the, chakra on the left hand side, by which you get angina, also, you might get cervical cancer, spondylitis, and lethargic problems. The second condition is, even simpler: that you have to forgive everyone. Many people say ‘it is difficult to forgive,’ but logically, weather you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do? You don’t do anything! But if you, forgive then you don’t play into wrong hands. Moreover, the center here which we call as Agnya Chakra, the optic chasma, is a very constricted chakra like this [left and right-side crossing]. If you don’t forgive it won’t open, and the Kundalini won’t pass through. So, as it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving, and at this great moment, again, you’ll miss the point of Self-Realization. You don’t have to think about whom you have to forgive, but in general you have to say, in your heart, ‘I forgive everyone.’ Third condition is that you have to be absolutely confident that you can get your Self-Realization tonight. You must have faith in yourself. Some people think that they are not good and they have done wrong and now...forget it just now. Please do not condemn yourself, but be pleasantly placed towards yourself. But if you are frivolous, it won’t work out, I have told you already. So, I respect your freedom, and those who do not want to have Self-Realization should leave the hall to be civil to others. Would be a better idea that those people who do not want to have their Self-Realization should leave the hall.

Lastly, this is not an individual happening, but it is a collective happening. The microcosms become the macrocosm. You become part and parcel of the whole. So, this is a collective happening. After getting your Realization, you must take it seriously, and you have to grow so that you reach that state which we call as Doubtless Awareness. You don’t have any doubts after that, and you get your powers to give Realization to others. You can cure others, you can help others, and you can work as an instrument of the Divine. This is what is the purpose of your life.

So, I would request again: the people who don’t want to have Self-Realization to leave the hall. You have to come to our follow-up programs where they will tell you each and everything about the Subtle System, the Knowledge about the Divine. And you don’t have to pay for it, but you have to give some time to yourself, that’s all.
