There is always excitement of the "New" but its significance is often Divine mother we are able to ward off all sinister attempts and neutralise their impact. Furthermore, with the new consciousness of Divine love, our pure eclipsed because in darkness one only sees shadows. The shadows are not reality. Although most people sense that something great is happening, they do not know what it is.

 Jan - Feb, 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze GURU PUJA Pravachna (Talk) by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi (Cabella (1-8-99) Since we have come to Cabella, it is the us-the aggressiveness, the domination, ten years completed. So, you can imagine how in these ten years we have been able to progress in Sahaja Yoga. Today we are going to have a Guru Puja. As I have said, peevishsness, fear, grabbing-all these are our inheritance and they are within us lingering. We want to grab things of others. Not you people, of course not, you all are gurus and you want to worship but people who are not yet in Sahaja me, as your Guru, is alright. But the main Yoga. They first used to grab lands. Then thing one should understand is that you they started grabbing people, making have become Guru, no doubt, because them slaves. Then they were not satisfied you have the knowledge, you have the with that. so they were grabbing absolute knowledge and so we can say, Kingdoms, jewellery and all these things. you have become gurus, no doubt. But They have no legal right, still they would one has to understand that you have grab. It seems very funny, it seems very reached a state where you can raise the inhuman but it is there because of our Kundalini, you can give realisation to others. Also, you know, what is the things like jealousy. Among animals there absolute knowledge. To know the is very little of that. They don't have absolute knowledge is very important and jealousy so much as we have while we to assimilate is even much more have inherited this jealousy by our own important. Though we know the absolute reactions and thinking. People get jealous knowledge we cannot assimilate it that and they want to put down others. If they much that means, we can not go deep into cannot achieve any height, they want to inheritance. Now, there are so many other it. What is the reason for that? bring down heights of others. This kind of jealousy when it grabs human beings, they think whatever is done in the name We have to realise that we have all come out of the heritage that was the animal Kingdom. From the animal Kingdom you have evolved. So, there are so many of jealousy is alright. They become very conscious that we are lower than another things of the animal heritage lingering in person, we lack in some talents than

 Jan - Feb. 2000 4 GURU PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze very good as a guru. As a guru we should not flare, we should not get angry, we another person and they try to over power that person because of the force of jealousy behind them. Now, the trouble is, though we are human beings, we have inherited so many animal qualities like we are ferocious, we are angry and we get upset as animals do but, additional to that human beings can react because of their should not try to oppress others. What can we do then, people will ask. We have another method what we call is love, love. Instead of getting angry if you show love and compassion to that person so what happens that it doesn't give you any anger and the another person, you don't make him angry also. Anger begets anger. If you thinking. They think, they can think and by thinking all these inherited properties become perverted. Like, a person wants to put down another person then he doesn't behave like an animal straight get angry with some body, that person may not retort because he is afraid of you may be that, but in his heart he will keep a revenge in his mind that one day I will show him why should he get angry with me. So, in Sahaja Yoga please remember forwardly but he will find out a device, a method, he will think it over how to do it. that love is the only way we can solve the The main problem with human beings is that they still have inherited very violent problem. Now, if something you wrong say, in the ashram, if you get angry with that person what will happen. That person will bear temper. This violent temper has to be controlled, has to be seen. When you see something which you don't like, which is against your will, may be something like that immediately you flare up. Just now I good Sahaja Yogi he may realise that it saw instead of the camphor they had put was a wrong thing to do. But, if he is a a sugar candy. To sugar candy they were bad Sahaja Yogi, not yet fully equipped putting the match box there using the to understand then what he will do. He match stick, it would not take the fire. will just feel that this man has insulted They tried and tried, it would not so, I me, he has deliberated put me down and a grudge against you. Perhaps, if he is a all that and I should try to take a revenge. said let me see what is that! So, that was Among animals this activity is very limited. I don't think they believe in revenge except for few animals, they say, that if you hurt a snake it will take its respite, it will come back on you, that's a sugar candy if it was camphor, it would just flare up. So, the quality of the person is known in the same way. If with the slightest provocation he gets into temper and gets annoyed then his quality is not

 The Divine Cool Breeze Jan - Feb. 2000 GURU PUJA what is said and this is one quality of the snake. But, as we have passed through all these different categories we might be having some of the qualities of some of these animals within us. We may be even snakes at some time. If the snake is within mean that if he has done wrongs, all kinds of wrongs you forgive him and he goes on, still with the same, doesn't mean. Forgiven means forgotten. Such and such person has been misbehaving so just forget it, forget it, completely forget it, for a guru it is important, for a Sahaja us then anybody who hurts you, you will remember him all your life-he has hurt Yogi guru. I must say other gurus were me so I will put him right one day, I will take a revenge- if there's a snake within us. But now, if there's a tiger within you, not like that. They were absolutely would say, extremely hot tempered and they used to loose temper on people. so, you will become very ferocious. At the smallest thing you will get angry, loose Once I met a guru and he told me, temper. Now, this is not a very good "Mother, you are too kind to them and situation that we are still at the level of with this kindness you cannot create good animals and our inheritance is still people. I have had enough of it, he said. I had made two people into gurus and one of them got lost in the money. Alright, So, we have to keep a watch, we have to what happened to the second? And the working in us. be good gurus and for good guru you second one got lost in the women."I said, have to have a very peaceful, now it's alright if they are lost, they are compassionate, loving temperament. lost but if you can revive them with your After all, one has to understand that love, affection and kindness better get people have this inheritance and some people have more, some people have this or some people have that. For that if you get angry with that person, it's not going to help him or help you but if you are loving and compassionate and you explain that person, what is the problem and what you want to do, I tell you he will definitely improve and he will feel your love. Of course, sometimes it is necessary to also forgive such a person. Such a person is to be forgiven absolutely. In that doesn't around them. So, as a guru you must conclude that they are still lingering with their inheritance. But, the second problem is much worse because human beings can think, of course, animals also think but it is always conditioning. Whatever conditioning they have accordingly they behave but they don't have ego that kind, as human beings have developed. So, the gurus develop also a very bad ego. The first ego is other

 Jan - Feb. 2000 6 The Divine Cool Breeze GURU PUJA was like this, your grandfather was like this, your great grand father was like this and you are also like this or some sort of a thing that will hurt him. By hurting a person you are not going to help. Supposing, while walking you are hurt, you can't walk. In your spiritual ascent gurus have seen they told me- that we have done so much, we have worked so hard to achieve this state and why should we give realisation to others or if they have got realisation then what have they done? Why should they get realisation? It becomes a comparison between their own state and how they have achieved it and how others have to achieve it. So, also if you are hurt you cannot go ahead. So, not to hurt people is very important. they made all kinds of different torturing, troubling manoeuvres. For example, they make the disciple stand on his head, give up his family, do this, do that, they can beat also. They will make him stay in the Once you go on hurting others then you are not a good guru, you are not one who is really being kind and understanding the disciple. In Sahaja Yoga it's a different thing water for a long time, make him stand on altogether because you all have achieved one feet. Like this they punish and worse Sahaja Yoga without doing any kind of penance, any kind of guilty consciousness, confessions, nothing. As you are, you got your realisation. Nobody had to stand on their heads, give up their husbands, wives, family, this thing nothing of the kind. As you are, whatever dress you are wearing, in whatever conditions you are, you are given realisation, it is a fact. You don't come to worse, they may beat with sticks or with stones, they are like that. They don't want to talk, they don't want to understand what the other person has to say or the one's who are the seekers, how they should be treated? All this anger and all these things might have been alright before but, after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you must know, it is not necessary. It is not at all necessary to give any physical punishment to your have to pay for it, you don't have to exert yourself, don't have to do anything. Just you get it sitting down, wherever you are. After that this kind of a happening should prove to you that you have a power of love, of compassion. Out of love you are given realisation we never realise that. Supposing, we are anxious to give realisation to people, we want to go to the villages, work there and give them disciples. Now, also the mental punishment to your disciples should not be given. Like people start saying all kinds of things to their disciples. Say, there's a leader and the leader finds something wrong with the disciple then he goes on saying now you are like this, your father

 Jan-Feb. 2000 GURU PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze 7. realisation. Why? Why do we do it? It is not for any fame, not for any reward or anything but just out of the love that is within your heart that you feel, why am I enjoying everything? Why others are not enjoying? And so you go out of the way to help people, to get their realisation. attached person. Now, what is the description of an attached person. Attached person is always worried about the other person, goes on thinking about the other person, cannot think of Sahaja Yoga, only think of the people with whom he is attached. Then he is very sensitive, you can't say anything to his brothers, sisters or anyone otherwise he jumps. Attachment is also with the name that he Now, you have become a greater human being and you feel concerned. Others are getting ruined, they are going on a wrong has. Supposing, he has achieved a certain path, they are doing wrong things and that makes you feel very-very upset and youdoes he do. You can't challenge him any name, or some big position, then what want to help them and this understanding once you have then you will know how to deal with the person with whom you have to behave like a guru. Mostly it is way, you cannot, by any words, challenge because he is so identified with that, he thinks, he is a big person who has achieved such a lot of position in life. He not necessary to say anything harsh to that person, at the most you can tell the is so much attached that he wants the guru mistakes that they have committed but to pay respect to that attachment. Now, that too in such a soft manner that a which is the way you can solve that problem. Supposing, somebody is very much attached to his wife, say, for person doesn't get any shock. Now, somebody has too much example. Then you should not discuss and attachments say, for the family, for the argue with that person, not at all. Because wife, for the husband, children or he is still coming up slowly slowly up to this stage. Such a person is not absolutely a perfect Sahaja Yogi. So, what do have to do. If he is attached to his wife, let it be. But the divine will work it out something and once they come to Sahaja Yoga, still they have same amount of attachment, alright. doesn't matter. But you how far they will go with that attachment, and you will realise that what he has been how long it will continue is the point. You should be detached. If I say, you cannot thinking, doing and taking decisions is all wrong and once he discovers it himself then he will get detached but, if you go on telling him and try to argue it out, it be, it is a state. It is a state of mind when you are detached but when it comes to doing something for them you will go all out to help them but you are not an will never work out. So, must understand

 Jan - Feb. 2000 8 The Divine Cool Breeze GURU PUJA that as human beings whatever we were detached. But, when you will find the also, as Sahaja Yogis we have problems vibrations are showing or indicating and these should slowly slowly be something serious about that person, dissolved. Not by argument, not by saying what you will do, you will put full things but by love and compassion. If you attention to that, full attention. You put have love for a person, you will be amazed attention but not attachment. So the ninety nine percent (99%) people value attachment doesn't solve the problem, love. This is the third quality of human what solves the problem is attention. But beings, I should say. when you are not detached then your attention is attached attention. It's an First is his inheritance, second is he thinks attention that is not available to every one and thirdly that he values love. Anybody who loves the other person values that love because he thinks that this particular and attention that gets stuck, absolutely stuck into that person with whom you are identified. Try to understand. So, to be person is loving me, not my wealth, not by beauty, not my this thing but, he is loving me and this idea of love, this is something that will get him completely if you are of that level. Whenever you detached from that person easily. How? put attention to that particular person Now, it looks very funny that if you like who needs your attention, it will work. somebody, if you love somebody and then you should get detached. It is only attention on a person because you are identified with someone not actually, what we can say, paying attention to that person. And then your attention will work But if you are all the time wasting your possible in Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga attached to that person, your attention your state of mind is such that you are will be tired, it won't work out. It's a big absolutely detached and absolutely paradox that if you are attached to attached. How? For example, I have my someone then your attention doesn't daughter so I am detached. I never work and if you are not attached to that telephone to her, I am not bothered about person, you do everything else. Now, I her because in Sahaja Yoga you know have to give lecture alright, I am giving how is that person. If the vibrations are lecture then I have to do some cooking, I alright, why should you telephone! Why will do cooking, this, that, that. But all should you talk to! Why should you ask the time you are thinking about that for anything, no need. Only on vibrations person, all the time you want to have you will know how the person is and so, connection with that person, it's not it will seem that you are absolutely necessary. That person is alright. What is

 Jan - Feb. 2000 GURU PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze there to be so much worried about that good fellow, he is risen very nice and gone very deep. So, pay attention to those who are not so good and talk to them about it that you have to come up in a very sweet person? After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you have to do so many things, you have to raise Kundalini of so many, now, manner. You have to talk to these other people who are not yet there or who are still struggling. You have to understand, you have to notice- what are they doing? Why is it they are not improving or rising in their attention? What is the problem? Why the divine is not flowing through them? And you will find the reason for this is that people do not have good you are getting attached to one person somewhere, it's not a very good thing. By that kind of attachment your attention also becomes useless, absolutely useless. So, let the attention be free. Attention should not be bound by your attachments. Attention should be absolutely free. So, it works automatically, and you will be amazed, even if you do not pay attention, the attention will work it out. It is such a attention is because it is focused on someone all the time. They feel this is their responsibility that it should be focussed. It is just to give the explanation to say great thing to have this spiritual attention which is nothing but love. It will just act, you will be amazed how it acts! It's another worldl am talking about, not this that, see, naturally I have to be worried mundane world but something higher, about this or worried about that, is just where your attention works and works an explanation. so beautifully that you are amazed how it But, if you really don't fix your attention has worked. But, you should not bound it by your attachments. If it is bound, you to one person or ten persons only then can have very limited sphere-only the your attention looks after the whole people whom you are attached to or you world. It receives all the information and are attached to those person. That's why also it gives all the information, what is identification is made the way a guru to be done to correct the situation. So, should be detached. one has to rise into that state where you do not get angry, annoyed or upset, no, not at all. What happens to you that you see a situation and in that you are not involved. You see the situation and you Now, there are ten disciples and one guru and the guru likes only one. He thinks he is the best and he should be encouraged are away from it. Then you can solve the problem better. But if you are part parcel of that problem, then you cannot and should be given all possible help. But that's not going to help him, but on the contrary he should say he is already, a

 Jan - Feb. 2000 10 The Divine Cool Breeze GURU PUJA solve. It's like this I was telling that those simple things are there that if you who are fighting, say, cannot solve the understand that we suffer because problem but a person who is not fighting everybody feels responsible for us, can solve the problem. So, it's a very everybody thinks they are responsible, simple thing to understand that if you are they have to do, this is responsibility for identified, if you are involved with one us, somebody says, this responsibility we person or with one kind of a thing then have to do, all these things are worrying them and that is the reason today we have a very complex society. They are suffering from all kinds of diseases in which only and can be applied widely, wherever thinking is responsible. By this thinking you are lost. So, our attention has to be always free needed. That is the state one has to reach. all the time, thinking about one person, thinking about one problem, you reach If you reach that state of mind, it's not a I am saying you can do anything about it, it's just a state of mind. Now, how do we do that? Only through introspection. Through introspection you will understand that needs help to solve your problems. Firstly, the problem is how to nowhere. At that moment what you have to do is to leave it to the Paramchaitanya. If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, it will manage, it will solve the problem. Now I will tell you one thing, an experience. This time I was in America and I wanted to face yourself because you are little bit shy have a puja there. So, I said, let them or may be nervous about this. As the time come for the puja. It's nice if they want comes you will be amazed that this to come. Then they told me, "Mother, we nervousness has no meaning at all. When want to bring presents for you, for puja. So, how can we bring the presents?" I said, it's very simple-don't bring but they won't listen to that. They said, we will have to bring and the customs will trouble us and do this and do that. So, only one building ahead there was another building, where they were having a liquidation sale. I said, this is something nice, one can have a look at it. So I went in and I found things so cheap, unbelievable, very very expensive things for throwaway price. I you try to be deliberate about it, then it won't work out but if you are Sahaja, it will work out. So we come to the second point, apart from the attention, that we should leave everything into the hands of Paramchaitanya. Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem. This is the problem, let Paramchaitanya solve the problem, we are not bothered. So, a detachment comes in, you give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya to solve, so, you are not in it, you are away from it. Very-very was amazed how it is there! So, I told

 Jan - Feb. 2000 11 GURU PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze them I can purchase all these things, they will pay you but you bring all these things to Canajohri. They agreed, alright. They brought all the things all packed nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis. We had no problems of customs or anything. I paid them there. How you see things can be easily. But first, we must have pure love in our heart. Not love out of some gain or out of a some sort of a reward but pure love if we have, then we can work it out very easily, anything that you want to do: This is a very lengthy thing which can go on forever because after all the gurus have to know, what are their duties and why improved by understanding what is the most important thing is to love. But love is truth and truth is love. If you have love they are gurus? It's very important, is very important position that they are gurus and they should use that position for exhibiting tremendous understanding of their disciples and also their purpose should be clear cut. People should not doubt him, should not think why he's doing such and such thing. It should not be a mystery. It should be absolutely clear for somebody, genuine love, then anything you want to do with that person will be absolutely obvious because it will be truthful. Anything you say to such a person will be absolutely obvious, clearcut because it is absolutely truthful. So, when you are dealing with somebody also, you should be extremely truthful. cut. Of course, you need not say things that All these things I am telling you today because today we have completed ten will hurt you but you must use such wise methods that will not in anyway hurt the years of stay in Cabella. Cabella has been extremely kind to me. There are lots of other person, it will have an effect on that person. people to Sahaja Yoga, I tell you, very lots of. It is a very far fetched place, So, this kind of gurus we need now very much in Sahaja Yoga because Sahaja everybody discarded it and said where are Yoga has spread a lot. So, first of all, our we going to live and all that. But, here temper has to be brought into proper only it has worked and that should be shape. A guru has no business, I mean, accepted as a very big indication that the Sahaja Yogi guru, has no business to Sahaja Yoga does miraculously, lose temper, at all, on any point, miraculous. But foremost thing is you whatsoever. If they can really do that must know vibrations. If you don't know much, it will save us so much of worries, about vibrations then you can't do anything. For example, when I first came to Cabella somebody told me Mother, so much of problems, so much of mess we create. All this can be solved very

 Jan - Feb. 2000 GURU PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze 12 very lonely place, there are mafias around, only six-seven houses are there, where to struggle with anyone, you don't have to fight with anyone, you don't have to argue with anyone. Just try to meditate and achieve a state which I am describing to you where you get completely surrounded by love and affection. are you going? What is this? They all warned me. So, I came here, I immediately told them where I am going to buy it, tomorrow I will pay the money. They were surprised, how can you do that. I said, don't worry, its perfectly May God Bless You All alright. On vibrations I decided that this, is a wonderful place and my husband There's one thing which is important to understand that you should not go to helped me so much at that time, though everybody discouraged me everybody extremes of everything, which is also a human quality. For example, if they are gave a very big horrible picture, but still, where is the mafia now? It's gone, rational, they go on rationalising everything. I can't do this, I can't do that, something like that goes on. The second finished. part of it is that they become very emotional and they become so emotional that they start doing wrong things in the name of emotionality. You have to Now, to know about the thing you have to meditate and improve your vision, which should be clear cut. It should not be something, a vision which is reflecting your particular ideas about particular overcome these two things. If you have not overcome that what's the use- What's things but it should be clear cut. With the use of calling yourself Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yoga one has to know, the protection of the Goddess is on the top Minimum of minimum is that this much of your head, nothing can go wrong you must do-going to the extremes must with you, nothing will happen to you. It will all work out, I am sure. be avoided, keep a watch upon yourself. If you are going to the extremes, nothing will work out. You might develop cancer, develop horrible diseases on one side and You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga like this, you just get meditative and you feel that one day all of you should become like that, just meditative and this meditative temperament or whatever is the state, emits vibrations. It emits and on the other side you might become a very rational person and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head. So, you have to keep a balance all the time and with that balance like, somebody is a Sahaja Yogini and she has done something very wrong then you creates path for you, for your work, for your life, for everything. You don't have

 Jan - Feb. 2000 The Divine Cool Breeze GURU PUJA 13 thing can take you anywhere. So, to be should not become emotionally attached, O Mother! what is it? we should forgive emotional is not needed. You must love her, No! You tell her that you must and left is what you can call another improve your vibrations and must come extreme. One side it is emotional and to balance and once you are in balance other is rational. In rationality you can then I will consider your case, then I will start justifying anything like Hitler did. say it is so or not. But if she has no He said, no, this was right, what I was balance, goes into rationality, goes into doing was right. He took something into emotional thing and this emotional his head and now this is right, just his business can take you to, any nonsensical rationality. So, both things are to be thing as it is a psychological case and one properly balanced and you should see that can go into very very things that they are whatever you are doing are giving you a doing out of these emotional things. See, proper result. So thank you very much like even singing songs that are neurotic again and again. or anything, you see. All this emotional May God Bless You

 Jan - Feb. 2000 14 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI KRISHNA PUJA Cabella, 5-9-1999 Talk by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Tonight, we are going to worship Shri Krishna as "Virata". First it is important to understand the incarnation of Shri go beyond all temptations, go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of conditionings a sthitapragya. Sthitapragya is where, he doesn't feel like ordinary people, attracted towards things but, he is absolutely detached and this detached person doesn't take to any grievances, jealousy, all these things. That and to become Krishna. Krishna word comes from the word Krishi. Krishi means agriculture. He sowed seeds of spirituality and for that, first of all, He had to think, where are we as far as spirituuality is concermed. How is the land? He told but how to achieve it. He never told. And the second thing he described So. what had happened at the time of Shri is, that you must work, you have to work. Rama that he created lots of maryadas After all you have got all the human and by these maryadas people started tendencies is to work but, the fruit of the mentally thinking about it. "I am not work you leave it at the lotus feet of God supposed to do that. I am not supposed or as we call the Divine power. This is to do this." It was just a mental binding. another trick of His because He realised, It was not spontaneous, it was not Sahaja. how human beings were twisted and how As a result, people became extremely they had a ego, if you tell them something serious. They wouldn't talk much and how they will misinterpret it. So. He took they wouldn't laugh, they wouldn't enjoy the other may round that tell them anything. So. Shri Krishna decided that something absurd. first of all, He must remove them from Now, whatever work we do, your ego is this conditioning and this conditioning has to be removed in such a manner, that they intact and with that ego you can never give it up at the lotus feet of the Divine. Very impossible. So, He made a impossible situation that after sometime people will realise that this cannot be done and they will give up this idea of leaving enjoy themselves. Then, He found out there were three suggestions as far as achieving the goal was concerned. So, first of all, as He says, is to become a realised soul, sthitapragya (feera. To

 Jan- Feb. 2000 15 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI KRISHNA PUJA that, if I tell them directly-do like this, do like that, then they will say, of course, everything at the lotus feet of the Divine. This was the one how He prepared the land. Second thing He said, "Pushpam Falam Toyam", "Flowers, Fruit and Water", whatever you offer me, I will take that. But, when you do that you must have we did it and still we never achieved it. In India, there is a big cult we can call it, people who go to Pandarpur, for one month they walk in rags, singing the songs and on the way they go on eating food at different places. According to them, this is 'Ananya" bhakti and they achieve nothing. They have become very sick and ananya' (T-4) bhakti. Ananya means, completely single minded bhakti, when there is not the other. This is only possible after realisation. Only after realisation you can put the fruits of your work at the lotus very tired and have a very bad old age, feet of the Divine and only after self- realisation you can have 'ananya' bhakti But who can tell them, they are all lost in it. So, this is a way one could tackle means the devotion which is single human beings to show others the minded. stupidity. And so many people come and ask me, as I told you that how is it that we do so much bhakti of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing. These absurd conditions you put for human beings because they were so much complicated. So, many people tell me, "Mother, we are doing ananya bhakti" How? Because we are singing on the street, we are taking the name of God all the time, we are going to Pandarpur, you see, in rags and for one month we walk singing, singing, singing. This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He never gave. So, He is the one who prepared the land for sowing, we can say he is the one who was like a very great agriculturist. So, His name was Krishi, Krishna. There are so many things I have told you about Him, how His name came as Krishna, who was Radha, who was krishna and all those But, it is the way He wanted to neutralise things. But when He talked of these the absurdities of human beings that they thought this was the bhakti, which is not. Ananya bhakti is only possible when you are a realised soul, when you are things, also He told, that you should become Sthitapragya, that is, they called as Gyanyoga. Gyan means knowledge. So, you should get absolute knowledge. That He didn't say how? That you know what is absolute knowledge which you connected with the Divine, when there is not the other. This is how He tried to make three way attack on human beings can feel it on your fingertips in Sahaja and on their stupidity because He thought Yoga. His speciality was to create

 Jan - Feb. 2000 16 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI KRISHNA PUJA hypocrites. I just left them and sat in the discretion in people. He thought by doing all these things in a stupid manner, they might develop discretion to know that this is not the way you can achieve anything, you have to get your self realisation. Discretion was very important. At this juncture when we are facing a sort of a challenge of this new millennium, that the car, at the right moment. That was not such a good proposition or anything but I could see I am buying it out of my pity or you may call it compassion. But above the compassion was this discretion which said, nothing doing you better get out of it. So, this divine discretion is a very-very whole world is going to be destroyed and all those things people are talking, It is really very important to know through discretion what is good and what is bad. One may talk of something as very good, something as very bad. But the Divine discretion is very different, and it acts by itself. Once you are in the realm of Divine discretion you cannot commit mistakes, even if you want to do it. I will give you my example. We went to buy a house and the fellow was, you see, like a beggar; he came, he said we have nothing, we have important thing which we should see how it works and should be satisfied with it. Not to feel bad that we have missed a chance or anything but you must feel very happy that this thing has happened and that your divine discretion has taken on. So, sometimes it appears that in that divine discretion you may do something wrong, you have done something wrong but, if it is divine ultimately it will turn out to be very good. I gave you a very basic example but that is also very true when you practice Sahaja Yoga. no food, they have taken away all our things and we are just absolutely starving. When he said that we are starving, we have nothing, so, I felt pity for him, I said, alright increase the price. First we The Divine discretion is extremely important to play a very great part in our lives, because this divine discretion gives us the real joy of our being, of ourself, of Sahaja Yoga. So, the third point was, for Him, to make people joyous and happy. But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama, He didn't know how to do it? So, to give people joy He said, alright let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi, all sorts of things and with that He really originated many things which were sort of not serious, may look frivolous but in that increased the price. Still he was saying no-no, give us more. Still we increased the price. I told my husband, you increase the price. Though reluctantly, he increased the price. Third time again we increased the price then, he said, no we will have something more than this, a little more. Immediately, you see, this discretion worked and I said, these are

 Jan Feb. 2000 17 SHRI KRISHNA PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze whatever it is or all kinds of restrictions there was joy expressed. All that He did to give them a full idea as for a Sahaja you'll put. But if you have really the Yogi or we can say for a self realised soul; Divine discretion then, you will know what should be the attitude towards with whom he should talk, where he should go, what he should enjoy and you will see that he enjoy his life. Any everything. But it is not that you have to do it but it just works out, it is like that. That in the state of Sahaja you enjoy attachment with anything doesn't give everything, enjoyment and that is what you the full view of that person, of that His idea was to ereate a sense of joy thing. If you are detached then you can among people. There are lots of critics who have criticised this part of His life. According to them, religion means you should become just old at the age of are there. They are very-very beautiful see it, from above-above him. If you are detached you become thoughtlessly aware also. As I said now, see carpets carpets. Now, if they are mine I will be all the time worried because l am attached twenty years you should become an old man of eighty years something like that. Funny ideas of religious achievement. that these carpets should not be spoiled, something will go wrong. But if I am not attached I will look at those carpets and what do I see! The joy, the joy that is put in by the artist who has made them and that joy really tries to reflect in me also, that joy comes in me. So, to have But He talked of joy and He never talked of renunciation. He never talked that you give up your family, give up your children, you give up everything never, never. He said, you must enjoy-enjoy with detachment. For people it is very difficult to understand how can it be with happiness but not joy because joy is single detachment? With attachment you can and happiness is double; happiness and never enjoy. If you are attached to unhappiness, So even if I try to enjoy attachment to anything, there will be something you cannot enjoy anything in a full way. Like, supposing you are attached to your child, very simple thing something I will think still there is this- this point is there. But joy is all pervading. It has no boundaries and you just get dissolved in the ocean of joy. That was what Shri Krishna's ideas was that cut out you are attached to your child. You are attached to your child then you will be bothered about the things which should these maryadas. not be there which will not give joy to Now a days, we see the maryadas of so the child. You will not allow your child say, to go out or to talk to people, many things are really useless. For

 Jan - Feb, 2000 18 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI KRISHNA PUJA example, you have discovered the maryadas of religion. See when they live in maryadas then what happens, they sort of coagulate or they have all kinds of Then we have social maryadas. Social maryadas are there which are sometimes, when abandoned, can become very horrid also. Like, in the west the women think germination inside like the pond which is absolutely bound, which is not flowing like river. So, like that you see it becomes that the less dress they wear, the more beautiful they are. This is a new thing they have started. Now, this is absurd. If you see the discretion behind is very simple a kind of a closed mind with these maryadas and when you have these maryadas you start thinking whether I should do it or not, whether I will enjoy that we have been animals and now we don't want to have any clothes because we were animals. It's an animal heritage. That's why so many women do not want to wear full dresses. It's just the animal behaviour. So, the maryada or good maryadas also people can give up saying that we don't want any maryadas, we are it or not. With these maryadas only you kill the joy. Now, we have other maryadas about say, we have the religion. Many people who love to come to Sahaja Yoga but because they have maryadas of silly things of their religion, they cannot come. They think this is our religion while they don't understand. Falsehood becomes the free, we can do whatever we like. But in that freedom what do you achieve? Your animal instinct works in that freedom and you think you are a very free personality. maryadas and they don't understand that what is the maryada actually made by the Then we have maryadas of our country. religion. You see now in Islam what is happening; with these maryadas they want to have another country, this thing, that God has not made different different countries at all nor it is true that there are thing. In Christian religion same thing is different countries but variety is there. happening. Also, in Hindu religion. All Variety of people, variety of places is these maryadas are really stagnating them there. These varieties must be accepted completely and they are getting crushed as something very artistic and one should into it. There is no discretion because they not get ruined and confused with those have said it, they will do it. They are so ideas that we are Americans, we are Indians, we are this and we are that. You much blind folded about it that they are not. Now, you can know after Sahaja cannot see what is right and what is Yoga that you are all Sahaja Yogis and you don't belong to any country as such. The country may belong to you but you wrong. But after Sahaja, you can see, you can laugh at them when you can see.

 Jan - Feb. 2000 19 SHRI KRISHNA PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze people who do not live with dharma, they are adharmis. So, you have to fight and that is how His fighting was so much justified because after fighting the war don't belong to the country. I mean the work is today to understand that if you really want to care for all these countries and all that then you must do some work. they got back what they deserved. They were deceived and this is what Shri Work of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these silly ideas of fighting for the Krishna said that you should not by any chance become a slave of these people but you fight it back. territory, for this, for that. All over the world there is going on, we want this land, we want that land. Land belongs to God, not to human beings and what is the use of fighting for this land, I don't So, fighting also is justified in the divine understand. But this confusion is there. discretion. It is again the divine discretion, this illusion is there and people work out where you have to fight because you don't on this confusion and illusion to such an want to be a slave. If you are a slave, you extent that they ruin their lives, the lives are no good. So for that you can fight. of their children. So many people are lost, But when people start fighting for separation or for territory, is not correct. so many people are in the lunatic asylum I should say because they end up in some sort of a refugee camp. They are having a good house, nicely living there and then you become a refugee, why? Because On the contrary, one should never think of separating from the main lands. It creates lots of problems. But now we believe in the global religion, we believe in the global territory. We don't have to they believe that they can have their own land, they can have their own place and ask for anything. Anywhere you go, you are the citizen of that place. Anybody who they should live there. This idea comes I think from some stupid leaders who want to have for themselves these lands and that's how people fight for land. There's no need to fight for land or fight for your country or fight for this or fight for that. wants to go Russia ever, the whole Russians will be with you, you go to America they will be with you. That's how because all these are the ideas of human heings and if the human beings get transformed there will be no problem of But the situation is such that unless and any war or any territory to be achieved. until you fight, you cannot get to the truth and that's why, if you remember that Shri Krishna told Arjuna that you fight. You have to fight, that's your work. You have to fight these people because they are the This was the divine discretion of Shri Krishna which is still within us as you know that this is a part and parcel of Vishudhi chakra where Shri Krishna

 Jan - Feb. 2000 20 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI KRISHNA PUJA resides. But when He rises to your ambitions, everything passes through that and it works. You have seen how many Sahasrara, when He rises to that level then He becomes virat. So, virata's chakra is miracles have taken place in your lives. It placed in the head here above the Agnya and this virat is the form of Shri Krishna is the virat Shakti that works. who has risen above the Agnya. When Now, for that you have to know how to you are risen above the Agnya, you worship virat? First of all, you have to rise above your ego, very important otherwise how can you worship? There become a part and parcel of virata's land, we can say because unless and until you Is your ego standing in between and how can you rise up to the point of virat? You are above your ego you are still involved with your self and with wrong ideas of maryadas. But, when you rise above that and you become the virata, the great, then you are in the land of virata and virata's have to pass through that. Once you are above your ego you enter into the Kingdom of virat. There the king is the virat and you are the subject who are powers are tremendous. looked after completely by Virat Shakti, As was seen by Arjuna the form of virat, by the power of virat. But at that stage the power of virat becomes so you become really a universal personality tremendous that it acts globally. It acts in in a way because whatever are our such a manner that you sit here and problems universally. Now not necessarily anywhere it can act. You have seen that that they should be attached to you or now, many-a-times people say Mother it's connected to you. Supposing, a person is of that level, now there may be a war a miracle. My mother was sick and she was not here and I just prayed and she in some other country, it can stop. got alright. This is all the power of virat. The power of virat is that it can penetrate into the subtle side of human beings in such a manner that everything we are connected with it, we are not separate. As every drop is connected with the Somebody who is being oppressed can win over. Anywhere your compassion moves it works out. Wherever your attention goes it will work out and sometimes you are surprised as to how it works Mother, how these things work ocean, we are connected with the whole out, how these coincidences have taken universe and when you become a citizen, I should say, of Virat then all the things place. Only thing is you have crossed that state of your ego and have gone into the with which you are connected also get your vibrations, your ideas, your state of Virat which is a very important thing to do, is to enter into the area of

 Jan - Feb, 2000 21 SHRI KRISHNA PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze demonstrative of what they think they are but, in the case of a person who rises above his ego and is a part and parcel of Virata. Then you don't think this is your country, this belongs to you, that belongs to you. This belonging business finishes that virata-shakti, enters into the off, then you belong to virat and He uses Kingdom of virat, he knows, he is very small. He is very small compared to that and he just dissolves into that Shakti and for his own purpose in the sense that when your whole thinking is different, you becomes global thinking, then He acts and then His powers are manifold. As Krishna's power is that He uses a conch this should happen to us that we should humble down, we should humble down and know that our powers, whatever we have if they give us ego, we should get to call people, I have given conches to all the leaders. So, we have to now announce rid of it. and call people. But at the level of virat, you don't have to do all that. At the level of virat people see and they will know. We shouldn't have that ego, we should Just they will match you and they will get rid of it and we should actually achieve know, just they will think you are human that state where you can be called as the beings and you are so sweet, so good, citizens of the virata's power. just like gems, shining all the time. So, May God Bless You All. they will be impressed. This comes through the virata's blessings. When you Now, when you are entering into the become that then you forget about other Kingdom of virata, you have to be like things like your big positions or anything children. You are children there, as or you come from a very rich family. All children you enter. As Christ has said, these nonsensical things which are "when you enter into the Kingdom of actually not true and all these things on God, you have to be like children".

 The Divine Cool Breeze Jan - Feb. 2000 22 SHRI RAM PUJA, (4-10-87) SWITZERLAND TODAY we are celebrating in Switzerland price. May be, we might be able to present you all with one, when you come there. But the story of Rama, they say, was the coronation of Shri Rama on Dussehra day. Many things happened on Dussehra Day. The most important was that Shri Rama was coronated as a king on this written, before he was born. Even before there was any inkling of it. The seer, day. He also killed Ravana on this day. Valmiki wrote the whole story of Shri Many may say that how can it be that he Rama. killed Ravana and he was coronated on Shri Rama's birth and all that are brought the same day. In these days in India we forth by the Agni, the fire. And he was born in the Dynasty of the Surya, the sun. had supersonic aeroplanes. The name of aeroplane was Pushpak, meaning the flower. It was called as Pushpak and it had a tremendous speed. So, after killing Ravana He came to Ayodhya with his wife So with all that, born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire, and also was born in the dynasty of Surya. He was one of the mildest Avtaras you have ever had. and that was the day he was crowned. He is known to be a very formal person On the 9th day He worshipped the Goddess, to get strength, Shakti for His in the sense (Sankoch) that he would go weapons and on the 10th day, He killed Ravana. So you can imagine how much problems than to tell others to do advanced people were there at the time something. of Shri Rama and his kingdom. The We still had many people in India like that. reason was, the king was an incarnation; Like, we had one Prime Minister, Lal also he was a benevolent king as described Bahadur Shastri and if he was sitting in a to any extent to bear upon himself the by Socrates. room and the people sitting and the electricity was on, somehow say by light or something and he wants to put it off, Shri Rama's story is very interesting throughout and we have now a beautiful series about him done by our television in India, which is sold for a very good he would not ask anyone to put it off. Slowly he will get up from his seat, walk

 Jan - Feb. 2000 23 SHRI RAM PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze in all his character you see the beauty. Like, he was going by a little boat when upto the switch and just put it off. So that. he shouldn't ask for it. This is one of the he went for his exile. Other one who was greatest quality of Shri Rama that he would not make anyone do anything for him or order anything or would use someone for their purpose. See, he was the blessing of fire and born in the Surya taking him was an ordinary boatman and the boatman was feeling very much upset that he is sitting before the king of Ayodhya and he does not have proper clothes. So, Shri Rama who was himself but what we find, those people who are wearing nothing but valkalas, are the clothes which are worn by the village people or worn by the people who live in the primitive areas, only kind of leaves born, may be, in very lowly families, in the negative families, the left sided as we can call it with all kinds of problems, have a terrible Agnya and a terrible Surya in that they have. He had to wear that them. The person who is born in the Surya because his step mother asked for that has to be extremely humble. He is the one who shows that nothing can affect, nothing can make him feel that he is kind of a boon from his father. And then, Shri Rama just told him why are you worried? I am wearing this, I am no more something great. Now, when we see his a king. I am sitting before you like this. You should be quite comforted and I really don't know how to steer the boat life further, he was a very humble man. You see, now, the people who try to despise others I don't like you, I don't like, this is not good, it is very difficult, is a sign that such a person is extremely low in character, has no character at all but is low in that. Anybody who has any character, is shown by the tolerance he has of other people. Intolerance is a sign while you know how to steer the boat. So, why should you be worried? Like that, he kept even the people whom you would call as low in Society at a very high pedestal, which shows that he respected human beings. of a person who is extremely egoistical and has its weight, its vanity. He himself is called as Maryada Purushotama, means he was the one who Shri Rama was so much loved by the knew how far to go with someone (Maryadas), how to talk to someone, how to approach someone. While we find people who misbehave even with their people, where he ruled in that state and he had the most beautiful wife of the most venerated father Janaka and who was the husbands, with their wives, with their beloved son of his father. But he was such children, with everyone and also outside, an humble man, such an humble man that

 Jan - Feb. 2000 24 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI RAM PUJA they are about to jump on us. That's that none of them are sour. Shri Rama absolutely against Rama, it's like Ravana. didn't like sour fruits, she knew. So, none Even Ravana was not like this. He was of them are sour and you can have them. I mean in a way if it is done to somebody in the west they will hit you hard. also of not that nature. Because he had certain dharmas within him. He was a realised soul but he had become a raksha Immediately Shri Rama rushed forward because he became arrogant. But, even and took the 'bers' from her hands. his arrogance cannot be matched with Kissed her hands, said alright, alright, I many modern people and modern girls am going to have them. With such and men that I hear and see. That it is enthusiasm he ate them. So, Lakshmana surprising they have really surpassed Ravana. Ravana only had ten heads but was little angry at that lady, what's this going on? So, Sitaji said, "Oh, do you like them very much? He said, yes, but I am not going to give you anything." She said, "No! I am your half body. You have to give me." So, he gave some to Sitaji. So, Sitaji said, "Ah! what a thing it is like nectar of heaven I am eating". So, Lakshmana felt very jealous. He said, "sister-in-law, can't I not have a little of it?". She said, "No! I can't give you. You sometimes I feel that the modern men might have or the women specially might have 108 heads. The arrogance, the amount of expression of hatred is so ridiculous and makes a person look so useless. But I see such people very common and in Sahaja Yoga also they crawl somehow. Actually such people are absolutely despised by God Almighty. ask your brother. I am not going to give I have a very little share. Why don't You go further with his life. See, he went you, into the village where a very old woman who was belonging to the primitive class of Bheels, had very few teeth and, she more?" So, Shri Rama smiled and gave brought some fruits, little fruits we call him that 'ber' which was eaten or tasted as ber. And she brought and gave it to or pierced by the teeth of a primitive you ask your brother?" So, he goes to his brother, says, 'Can I have some him that, Shri Rama, you see, I have got woman, who is actually an outcaste according to a brahminic laws of India. these "phal'. I don't have anything else and these, I have tasted all of them. Actually in India, if you put in the month it is 'uthishta'. Nobody will touch it. But she said, I have tasted all of them by The sweetness of Shri Rama, the way he used to make people feel comfortable like, I would say an example of a oyster who piercing my teeth into it and I have seen gets a little stone into the body of the shell,

 Jan - Feb. 2000 25 SHRI RAM PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze takes out a kind of a shiny liquid and covers it with that shiny liquid and makes it into a pearl to be comfortable. Now, he It is an example of Shri Rama. He never cared for the outer side or the outward looks of a person. Because he came before Shri Krishna, he tried to build up didn't want his own comfort. Rama is the inner side of a human being. little bit different that he wanted to make every one into a diamond or a pearl so that, the other person would shine and So, we can say, though he is on the right t heart he acts through your Hamsa chakra and partly through your vishudhi chakra would look ice and that's how he felt comforted. in the inner side of it. Because Shri Krishna, in the inner side of it, is Shri His qualities, if we have to imbibe, first of all, we have to understand the innate Rama; is Shri Vishnu. So, when situation of Shri Rama. Shri Rama is somebody is not say, good looking placed on the right hand side of your according to the western-standards. heart. Right hand side, right heart, he is According to me the western standards are rather funny. Because western standards don't look like neither like placed there. Now, in a human being there is no right heart. If you tell somebody, there is right heart, he will say what? There are two hearts? Or three hearts? Krishna or Shri Rama. The person like Shri Rama was a very healthy, tall person with his hands up to the knees. Ajanubhav In our Sahaja Yoga we have three hearts. One is the left, another is the right and one is the centre. Now, the right heart is a very important thing. Right heart looks after the whole lungs, both the lungs or (3T17). He is the one who has Ajanubhav and he was plump. Both of them were plump. They had to be plump people though, he was born of the Agni but the water, is the main element of Shri the throat, the trachea, the nose the inner Vishnu. So, they were all plump people. They were not thin like sticks as today's part. The outer side is looked after, we can say, the features are given by Shri Krishna but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama. They are the same. But one acts as the inner part and the another as the outer part. He gives you the ears from the inner part Shri Rama does. He gives you the eyes and the inner part of the eyes. Now, it's so important to have modern ideas are, to be thin like sticks and like T.B. patients, but it does not mean all plump people are good.We always logically think that plump people are, if Mother says to, then, plump people are good, it's not the point. The inner side of it, I am saying. The inner side of it is just the opposite. Inner side of it is the inner side alright and the outer side.

I mean to a person person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, first of like Rama, who is Maryada Purushotama, all. A person who is very loud, talks to ask such a horrible question, somebody loudly, speaks loudly, laughs at wrong would have really beaten her up if not places, must be half mad, but, cannot be anything else. So, Shri Ram smiled. He a Sahaja Yogi. See the softness of Shri said, "Madam I am sorry. I have a wife and I believe in one wife (एकपल्निव्रत). So the Sankoch ( ), the formality the I am sorry I cannot marry you but formal but if you see in English language mischievously He says, alright my 'formal' is not the word, Sankoch. He is there, his wife is left in Ayodhya, you was, once when he was fighting Ravana, can ask him". She went to him and asked he was taking out with his arrow his ten Lakshmana, "why don't you marry me?" heads, one after another. And if he took She had become very beautiful. She Rama goes to the extremes where I call brother out the one, then took out the second, transformed herself into a beautiful the first one would come back because, woman. She must have gone to some beauty parlour or something. She made he had a kind of a blessing that nobody can kill him by hitting him on his head. herself like that and she was there. And So, Laksmana says you know for definite he looked at her, & was so angry. He said, that this Ravama cannot be killed by you the ugly, why do you ask such a hitting on his head so, why don't you hit him in his heart? So, he said, the reason question and he cut her nose. When he cut her nose, that was in Nasik & that's is this that just now in his heart is why Nasika means the nose and that's Mahalakshmi, the Sita. Sita is sitting in way you have been to nasik. That's the his heart and how can I hit him on his place where he cut her nose. He was very heart because she is there. She might be hurt. So what's the use of hitting on the angry, but Shri Rama did not. He said in a way that is very convincing that see I have a wife and I am a person who head, he said? He said, because once I start hitting him on the head fast his believes in one wife. attention will go there. As soon as his Now another character about him was attention will go into his head then I can that he was consistent. He was never hit him on his heart. See, the Sankoch, inconsistent like Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna was a diplomat and diplomacy is the way he talked. Then what happened that he was so kind, once when a very

So she disappeared into mother earth. Then Shri Rama became absolutely lost and he jumped in the river Saryu and disappeared in the water element from where he had come. was different. In Sahaja Yoga you can't carry on like Shri Rama. Sometimes you have to be Parshurama also. Otherwise things don't work out. Now when it went ahead with it in his character, which was so beautiful that you find that he was such a consistent person. Whatever he said all the life he carried that. For example, he said, "I am the one who believes in one wife Ekpatnivrat". ( ana Now he Now this man had to give up his wife.

If he is evil and then I will go with him, with all the glory. She was not frightened of there is no aggression then there is recession. But, she said, "No, I have to give birth to these two children. I can look anything. For her the important thing was that Ravana should be killed. He is evil after myself." Alright graciously it is done. I am nothing please tell him not to worry and should be killed by Rama. Such a great courage for a woman. Both sides if about me and she told Shri Lakshmana you see, you will be surprised that how a woman's character is such a powerful thing. Its not a reactionary thing, my husband is like this, that's why I am like that alright you look after him and that's all I want and she told the Chief Minister, the Mantri, that you must look after the kingdom. See the dignity, see the balance, see the character, the personality of Shri Rama. He was called as Maryada that or my husband doesn't do this for me, that's why I am this. My husband has gone away, so I am finished. What am I to do without my husband? Nothing of Purushotama and look at his wife. She was equal to him in every way. When she was kept by Ravana, Ravana was so frightened of her shakti that he would not touch her. He used to frighten her saying that I will do this to the women of India, the kind. She stands on her feet. She said no, to Hanumana and she stands on her feet and she says when Shri Rama will come, and kill this evil and remove this I will do this to the women of the world, evil from this earth, then only he can take I will do that kind of a horrible things, I me with him.

Why did all kinds of things to her. But she kept did he leave you like this? See, the sweetness of Shri Hanumana, who was absolutely calm and quiet waiting for her husband to come. Can we think of such such a great devotee, such a great devotee of Shri Rama, could see that he has done women in modern times!! So satisfied with themselves. So much in balance. So much full of confidence and strength. This is the message of Sita's life. injustice to my mother and he stood for that. Its very sweet of Shri Hanumana to do that. Hanumana, as you know, is the angel Gabrial, who is innocence, simplicity and dynamism,. His dynamism The Benevolence of Shri Rama was shown when he started ruling the people. He was the one who cared for the needs was such that as soon as he was born, he said better eat this sun, because the sun of the people. For him it was important that the people whom he ruled should be happy and joyous. He looked after them with great love. He had two sons whom he looked after for a short time because they were lost with the mother, Sita and they are the ones who found him out in a is scorching the people in India. So, he went and gulped down the sun. People had to say that you see, though it is true the sun is scorching but it is of great help. Please release the sun. Why did you eat it off? So then, he released the sun. way that Valmiki taught them how to sing the Ramayana. And they went to Ayodhya and sang the Ramayana.

Hanumana found it impossible to fight had Navdha Sidhis, Nine siddhis-Anima, Garima, Raghuma and all sorts of things those two boys and he couldn't understand.

So you go and get a particular kind of a Sanjeevani, a king of a herb, which I That's the sign of a person who is either possessed and under the influence of possession is doing that he is too weak and he is possessed by his anger because he doesn't have that much power to bear anything. The most powerful thing is the mother earth because she has the power to bear. The one who has the power to bear is the powerful. The one who does not have any power to bear. I can't bear, I don't like this. Such a person is useless want to rub on his head. So he went there and he could not find it. So, he brought the whole of the mountain on his hand and gave it to Rama, now you select I don't know, I can't find it. That is the Hanumana Shakti. And with all that power he was such a humble person and such a dedicated person. This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi. thing for this earth and sometimes I feel why God created them. Its a headache to have a person around. I can't eat this, I don't like this. Then why are you here? Nobody likes you either. No one likes such a person and that's why that person Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and nonviolent. Mahatma Gandhi used to say, that what is the nonviolence of the weak. A weak has to be nonviolent. What is so great! That's a policy or a kind of a protection that he has. So a weak is always I don't like this, I don't like that. So, the power of a person lies in bearing person has to be nonviolent because he cannot face, he cannot protest. But things. How much you can bear! How much vou can undergo? Without feeling nonviolence of the powerful is the sign of the real nonviolence. Those who are it like you are, say, in a jungle you are powerful, if they are nonviolent, that happy, if you are in a palace you are means they are quite confident of their happy. If you are with this colour or that powers. Those people who are confident colour, if you are with this race or that of their powers, why should do they race, if you are with this kind of life or agress others? They just stand. Alright, that kind of life, you can bear it, and that come along, what do you want? Even bearing power gives you the caliber, the saying that people run away. So, those Caliber to have Sahaja Yoga. It's not that who are violent, angry, hot-tempered, this is shown, its not that this is being jump at everyone, torture everyone suffered, don't have to say I suffer being trouble everyone are the people who are like this. No, you don't suffer. Its just by very weak-charactered. Their character is weak. If their character was alright then the way. For a person who wants all the comforts. they would not have done all these things.

 Jan - Feb. 2000 31 SHRI RAM PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze if you know how to detach yourself from A person who wants to live with all the luxuries but not with any kind of defects that. Many people come and tell me or any deficiencies, is a person is a beggar Mother, we have an ego, that is the problem. I said, then give up. I mean it's I would say, in every sense of the word. I simple. Why do you have it. As if you see they want to say that we have a trouble with this thing but still we are clinging on mean best thing to get rid of problems is not to have them. In the sense now I don't drive, so I have no problem of driving I never telephone so I don't have problems of telephone. I don't go to the banks, so I don't have problems of the banks. The to it. Like we are afraid of a crocodile but we want to put our foot into the mouth of the crocodile and we have a problem that our foot will be eaten up by best is I don't have any income so I have the crocodile. Now give up. But they will no problems of Income-tax. Whatever search out the crocodile. Open the mouth bothers you, you just don't have it. Why and put the foot in it and then come to me and say mother, we have a problem. My foot is in the mouth of the crocodile. do you want to have it? Have it and then bother about it. This is very funny that you can get rid of anything that bothers To get to problems you have to get to it. But without getting to it how will you get a problem. Say for example people have very silly stupid problems. Now the first problem somebody may have oh, I have to get my clothes pressed. What's you very easily in this world. So you need not have that kind of a thing on your head. The word problem, specially in the european community problem is a very common word. But in the English language we never heard this word. the need? No problem, Wear them as they problem. You see the problem was used when we were studying geometry; geometrical problem. But, we never knew there is a problem in life. Later on, when are. Who looks at you? You see there are all the people who have pressed clothes, does not matter, what's there if it is not pressed. It's a problem for them, is silly came in contact with European things like that. You see very silly things. community, they will say there is no problem, this is the problem. At least, in But the greatest problem I think you have is your watch. In Switzerland, I shouldn't one day, 100 times they say problem word. So, for a problem the solution is not to have that thing which gives you say so. You see the problem is like this, that now you have to go to the airport.

The problem is that you call it a problem and want to avoid to face the truth. If you face the truth you will know one thing that see now this man has to give me money. Alright, I will go and face him. I'll tell him Sir, you have to give me the money. You have to pay me. wrong with you? It's a problem; I said, what's the problem? You just know that This is your duty and if you don't pay me, you are doing wrong. You get at aim and face him and tell him. But you won't you don't have to go at all and you don't have to come to the airport and the aeroplane if it comes and does not take me I am not going to come back on your heads, so, I will stay in a hotel. Don't you worry! But why are you so excited about do that. You will sit at home. Oh God! it's a problem. That man is not giving me money. Oh! God! that's the problem. Sitting here, hitting your head all the time. it? The way people are excited that I must catch the plane, sometimes I feel as if they How will you get it? want to get rid of me. If you face it directly then you will be So, this is a problem for the people who amazed there is no problem for anything. are very meticulous. Now, supposing, I say I know that the plane won't leave me. I know because I know many things. So, I have no problems. But supposing even Say, your car fails, so it fails. Get down enjoy yourself nicely till somebody comes along, takes you or if supposing, you don't get some lift, alright stay there over night; What is in it! No tiger is going to eat you. And if the tiger has to eat you, it will eat. Where is the problem? Still I can't see the problem. If tiger has to eat that's already destined, that the tiger has to eat. In any case nobody dies. You will be born again. If you look at it from that angle then you will be surprised most of the problems do not exist. They are like bubbles, created by our own thinking. The waves of our thinking, this is the problem, that is the problem. Like today, they said if you think the plane you may not get, so it may not get. But, if it gets you alright, if does not get you its alright. So, where is the problem? Either it will take you or it will not take you, what is in between? Where is the problem? I still don't understand? Either it will work out or it will not work out. Keep two possibilities. That's the only two possibilities.

He done to our centre heart is the greatest thing that he has given you a fatherhood, arranged all these things so that he could walk down to Maharashtra barefeet to within yourself. Because Shri Rama vibrate the land because Sahaja Yogis will represents the fatherhood. Now what sort of father you are, you have to decide. be going one day to Maharashtra and the Maharashtra has to be a vibrated land. In Ayodhya he never took out his shoes. Those people who are not good fathers, Because he was the king there. But when develop problems of the right heart. Also he, and Shri Sita, both of them, went to those people who are not good husbands Maharashtra, they took out their shoes also develop the right heart. This right to vibrate it. On his way he saw a big stone heart is so important, because specially which was nothing but a lady cursed to in the west, where the climate is so funny, be a stone, Ahilaya, and he made her just you have to keep inside your rooms and by touch, she again came back to life. Like clothed up all the time that you get all that one after another he was just, by the dried up inside. At that time if you don't way, as if he was doing. But that was the have that sweetness, that warmth, that kindness of Shri Rama you get the trouble purpose of his life to go there. And that has helped a very great achievement of Asthma. So, many people die of Asthama, in the west. On top of that you within ourselves is the Shri Rama. fight with your wives, you beat them, you Shri Rama stands for the Pranavayu take away their money, you cheat them , is for the vital air that we take in their money, in every way you torture

Otherwise if you fall in this activity of keeping your wives on right lines you might also get right heart and Asthama ultimately. them. Then it becomes even worse. So it has something to do with money, in the sense because Sitaji was Shri laxmi and Sitaji was the one who was the power of Shri Rama. So Shri Laxmi also gets Because your wife and you are part of annoyed with you when you are a bad the society and the society has certain father as a bad husband. That's why the laws which are very important. There is Gruhalaxmi is very important. But the something like stridharma something like woman has to be the Grahalaxmi. She Patidharma, something like Matadharma, should not be a shrew and then the Pitadharma, everything has a dharma. husband is supposed to be kind to her. Then it is quarrelling. That's very bad. The woman has to be a Grahalaxmi, a Those men who torture their wives have very bad heart, in the same way those who play into the hands of their wives also have a very bad right heart. beautiful woman with a very sweet nature and talking to her husband in a very You have to be in the balance. You are the husband and she is your wife and both are responsible for keeping a very good family relationship. It's not one sided. Its Sankoch manner and also looking after the children, looking after the family and looking after the guests who come to their house. But if you encourage and run after such women who are no good, means not the husband only or the wife but both collectively they should be improved. If of them have to be in such a manner, that collectively they do not act well. they act according to their nature of collectively if they are aggressive, woman and man, and respect each other, collectively if they are tormanting others love each other, share everything with each other and exist in a way that people then such women should not be encouraged at all. But Tulsidas says they should see that there are two wheels of the chariot, one on the left, one on the should be beaten up, is a thing looks very right, there is no imbalance. They are bad in modern times if somebody says like equal but not similar as I have told you many a times. that, that women should be beaten in case they have all such qualities which disqualify them from being Grahalaxmis. up Now, in the case of Shri Rama, he left his Of course, there is no need to beat them wife, When it came to Sita she left him but I mean to say that what is it that you too. But she left him as a woman would have to drive out all these badhas from leave and he left her as a man would leave.

 Jan - Feb. 2000 35 SHRI RAM PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze She also left him, but in a way that is again. There are some who do Aartis just suitable for a woman to do and he did it because to show off, some throw flowers in a way that is suitable to a king. In the to show off. They must be the first and somehow or other they get also the position, because of their assertions and same way a woman when she acts, she has to act like a woman. The same things askings. The leaders have to be careful and not to give duties to such people who really upset me very much, because of their arrogance, because of their showing offs. I have to say one thing today, that she may do, as the man does but she has to be a woman and a man has to be a man. So that's the maryada Purushottama (a a a ahaa, is the one who is the highest among all the men, with his all the maryadas, all the boundries that he under the circumstances we have to decide that if the leaders don'thave wives, observes. The boudries are such that you do not try to overpower others, or you do not try to take their seats. For example I have seen, those who are aggressive also show up in our programmes. They will be the first before me, they will be, as soon as I open the gates they will be somewhere there standing. They will be the first in everything. That's not being who are humble, who are kind, who are compassionate and who are Gruhalaxmis, who are very sweet with the collective we have to cancel the husband as well as wife from the leadership. We cannot have leaders who have wives who are horrid, we cannot, because the wife of a leader is like the mother. in maryada. You should be at the back There are 5 types of mothers described, lane. There are leaders, you have got they can sit in the front. Try to be on the back. I want to be first. Then I have said once one of them is the one who is the wife of the Guru or of the leader and if the leader has a wife of that kind its better in all sense the first of the first. You know the story of first of the first. So you become first of the first and that's what happens to you he should be dropped. Improve his wife do whatever is possible. Till she is alright, he should not be the leader. Its a very when you try to show off and I know all important thing because I have seen such women bring down the men, not only that but they bring down the Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yogis and the whole organisation of them who are like this. To be at the back ground is the most respectable thing to do. To go forward first, to jump forward first, standing near the door if mother is coming you see. As of God. So one has to be careful and the women have to understand that if they are the wives of the leaders, they have to soon as I see the person I just know, back

Its such a luck and chance that your husband is the leader, is sharing, looking after, absolutely motherly and should not tolerate non- sense and should correct when people are doing wrong. They should not report anyone to their husbands, should not take over themselves the responsibility of the highest man in your nation, in Sahaja Yoga and where you have to be up to his doing things which they are not supposed to do.

Both of them compassion, security, peace, joy, have done so much for us, bring forth discipline anmong ourselves. The whole such a great life. All their life they suffered and suffered and suffered. They lived in the villages, they lived in the forests, while they were king and the queen. They had disciplining is within ourselves. What say about Shri Rama is that he himself has put himself into the discipline of maryadas. In the same way we ourselves should put ourselves into the discipline of maryadas. never known what is comfort, travelled all the way bare feet. They went through all kings of tortures of life. Sita was taken It's a very great thing that it should happen in Switzerland because away by Ravana, who was a horrid man. She had to live with a Rakshasa, can you imagine. She lived with a rakshasa and Switzerland needs it the most, the there she showed her greatness. The blessings of Shri Rama. The way it is characters of different nature like Sita and going on in this country, this very selfish, Shri Rama, they were showing the non benevolent activities going on, complimentary attributes that they had, cleaning all the poorer nations by this kind very complimentary and if that is so, then of a selfish attitude, a very narrow the husband-wife's relations are beautiful attitude, very low level attitude towards in Sahaja Yoga, that's the way it should the money of these poorer nations.

Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiving. He forgives because we are human beings, we commit mistakes, we do forgiven and have been given such a big thing like Self Realisation, still they do wrong things! Then He is much more wrathful. So in the balance the forgiveness wrong things, we get tempted, our attention is disturbed. He forgives us. He starts reducing and wrathfulness starts increasing. But when you forgive and as also forgives us when we spoil our a result of that forgiveness you feel the chastity, we do immoral things, we do gratitude, then His blessings start flowing theiving and when we talk against Him. towards you.

It is all described, how he looks after you like a shepherd. But He does not look after the evil beings. He discards them. still carry on with the evil nature, are destroyed. Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate are destroyed people who have been following wrong path, or you have been yourself one of the agents or Guru of these wrong people. Now these five problems can be solved if we completely give up whatever wrongs we have been doing. As Mohammed Saheb has said that you have to beat the or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. Those who murmur against God and live in a way that is not behoving a Sahaja Yogi, He removes that problem. So by one force he protects by another force He throws away. But his destructive forces, when they are built up Satan with shoes but that has to be done not mechanically but from your heart.

Now this Ekadash Rudra will this Guru, that Guru' and get involved be expressed when the Kalki itself will with their father, mother, sister, this that start acting; means the destructive power and try to take them out from those will destroy all that is negative on this Gurus, also get entangled.

The person who is still negative always gets attracted to another one who is very powerfully negative and does not understand that the other person is so half-baked Sahaja Yogis may try to understand. But most of them will know that this person is going-on his way out. He still leads to this left side development or we can call on the head on the right hand side, of your medha, (this place powerfully negative but gets impressed. Under such circumstances, such a person (Forehead) is called Medha in Sanskrit language). Now the right sided one comes from the idea people have that I am myself is hit by that negative person and Shiva cannot protect him. a big Guru. They start preaching about **** Sahaja Yoga also as if they have become great Gurus! We have known some One should not have sympathy with any one who is negative, whether he is mad, people who give big lectures in my whether there is something wrong with him, whether he is your relation or anything. No sympathy of any kind. On the contrary a kind of an anger should be programme and never allow my tape to be played or anything. They think they have become experts. Some of them say that now we have become so great that there for that person; kind of a we have no need to do any foot-soaking detachment, angry detachment. And this angry detachment is the only time meditation. There are some who say that when you have to be angry. But I have thing can never touch us since we are seen people who have anger for very good Sahaja Yogis and very great. But the Sahaja Yogis but not for their own worst of them all are those who just husband and wife who are extremely take my name saying that 'Mother has negative! So when the Ekadash Rudra said so' and I am telling because starts acting on these five on the right side Mother has said so, when I have never it moves from the left and moves to the said such a thing it is all falsehood. right side, then a person starts becoming Now there are some people who use negative but acting with his ego. Such a Sahaja Yoga money and exploit Sahaja person may take up any situation into Yoga in such a way exploit them, Sahaja or anything. There is no need to do hands and say that I am such and such Yogis also sometimes. Such people

Anyone speaking, now you should watch me who tries such things will go out of constantly so that there is thoughtless Sahaja Yoga with disgrace. But one awareness and Agnya Chakra is soothed out. Don't pay attention here and there all the time, then you will should never go near such a person, have nothing to do with such a person, have no sympathy. Because this inauspicious- find that gradually your attention will neutralize into thoughtless awareness ness will hurt anyone to any extent. So better keep out of such people. When these ten Ekadashas are developed within a person then definitely such a person gets and your attention will be fixed in such a manner that you don't have to worry about anything. In thoughtless diseases like cancer and incurable horrible awareness nobody can touch you, diseases, specially when the eleventh one which is actually here (in the forehead) that's your fortress. By meditation one must establish thoughtless awareness, which is the Virata's Chakra, which is the that is the sign that you are rising higher. Many people do meditation and say alright Mother we are doing, mechanically they do, and say yes, I did collectivity. When it is affected as well then such a person cannot get out of it. But out of these five are combined, this, I did this. supposing with Muladhara or with Agnya, then they get in to very serious type of dirty diseases. That's why I always But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness, minimum of minimum? say that be careful about your Agnya Have you felt your Cool Breeze coming out of your head? Otherwise if you are Chakra because that is one of the worst things that once start getting combined doing something mechanically, it is not with the Ekadashas, part of Ekadasha, then anything can happen to a person. He going to help, help you or help anyone. So after realisation, as you are very well can meet with a horrible accident, He can be suddenly hit by someone, murdered protected, you have all the blessings and a great future, you also have a great by someone, any thing can happen to such possibility of a complete annihilating. I would say, to give an analogy, you are a person who has the right Agnya and also anyone of the Ekadasha-right or left. That means five of these, if they. climbing and everybody supporting you anyone of the five, if they combine with Agnya Chakra, the protective power of God are minimum. So to keep vour protected to be taken upward. There is Agnya Chakra alright, see now I am to climb, holding your hand and there are so many things by which you are no possibility of falling off by mistake

 Jan-Feb. 2000 42 The Divine Cool Breeze EKADASHA RUDRA PUJA also. But if you try to remove your bondages with truth and love and all the time try to hit the people who are trying to support you then you fall from a greater height. Because the greater height you rise the greater you fall, and with the which is penetrating into every atom in to every molecule, into every human being, into every thing that is living and non living. Once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets into jeopardy. So the pleasing of Christ is very important. Now Christ has said that you have to be like greater force also. small children, that is the innocence, the purity of heart is the best way you can Every effort is made by the Divine, every support is given to you every care is please him. As in the west, specially, taken, despite that if you want to fall from that height, then it is very dangerous. But Ekadash rudra, at such a time when somebody tries to harm the cause of people have developed their brain too much, they try to play about with words and think that nobody knows what they are doing! All such people must know that Sahaja Yoga, after being in Sahaja Yoga then it hits you so badly that the wholle every thing you do is known to God. attack is very widespread. But the whole If you are not clean in the heart, it is family can be protected if there are few very dangerous for anybody to pose as people of that family doing Sahaja Yoga if he is a very good Sahaja Yogi. Such work, could be protected, but in case the people are not possessed, nor they are family that is against all the time of Sahaja conditioned, nor they are egoistical, but Yogis and try to trouble them can be they are very cunning, clever people and completely destroyed, very badly. Now they are quite aware as to what they are these Ekadasha Rudras come out of, as I doing. But there are people who get told you, the void. So we can say the possessed also and then in that they try destruction part of it comes from the void to destroy themselves or cry and weep mainly. But these are the powers, all are and do all kinds of things. There are some given in one person, that is the Maha who think that if they hurt themselves and Vishnu, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, do some sort of an extreme thing then because He is the support of the whole God will be happy, are sadly mistaken. If universe. He is the personification of you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga then you *Omkara'. He is the personification of should know that there is something vibrations. So when he gets angry then wrong with you. If you cannot feel the whole universe starts breaking. He happy in Sahaja Yoga than you must personifies the power of the Mother know that something definitely wrong

 Jan - Feb. 2000 43 EKADASHA RUDRA PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze home, and it is alright. But they do not know what they are missing! Whatever with you. If you cannot enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis, then be sure there is something wrong with you. If may be your experience with others you cannot love and appreciate the you should stick on together, always greatness of God then there is attend programmes, take leadership, something wrong with you. If you are still worried about negative people and will be blessed thousand folds. go ahead with it, work it out and you their problems then know that there Ekadasha Rudra are all the powers, I is something wrong with you. If you have sympathies with the negative would say, of destruction, together. It is people then also there is something the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha, is the destructive power of Wrong with you. But if you have anger for negative and all that is negative. Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha. It is the that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you destructive power of the Mother, is a destructive power of Bhairava are there. When this thing gets matured then you become the power Hanumana, Kartikeya and Ganesha. Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti. All the destructive powers of of Ekadash Rudra yourself. Anybody who will try to insult you, or do ay harm will collapse. It has happened all the incarnations are Ekadasha. Now with many people who tried to be the last but not the least is the destructive power of Hiranya Garbha, which is the collective Brahamadeva. And this power, insulting to me or tried to harm me in any way. Sometimes I am quite worried when it acts, every atom explodes, the whole atomic energy goes into a about them. destructive power. So the complete total So one has to be in such a way that they destructive power is Ekadasha Rudra. It is extremely powerful, explosive, but it is not blind. Its very discriminating and extremely diligently woven. It avoids all will become the Ekadasha. Nobody can touch such people but such a person is full of compassion and forgiveness. As a result Ekadasha act much faster. The good points and attacks the wrong things and it hits at the right time, at the right more compassionate you are, the more powerful Ekadasha becomes. The more collective you become the more point, direct, without hitting any thing that Ekadasha acts. Many people have a is good in between. Now the glance of habit of receding back into their Ekadash Rudra falls upon someone, for exclusion and saying that better be at example, and there is something in

He took her child, representing Sahaja positive thing, it penetrates through Yogi, you can say, or representing Christ positive without harming the positive, and or representing any one of the great hits the negative. It cools down children of Hers and put the Child under Her feet. When she was trampling. somebody and burns another. suddenly she saw Her own child under Her feet and such a big tongue came out So that is how it works with such care and such delicacy. And it is tremendously and she stopped. This has happened only sharp also. And its very painful. It is once. So after the Ekadasha Rudra, not like cutting the neck in one shot, it goes on slowly slowly. All the horrible torture, that you have learnt or heard about are the expressions of Ekadasha ultimately complete destruction comes through the anger of Sadashiva. Then the final, total, destruction takes place. So thus we have to know how Ekadasha Rudra. For example take the case of Rudra acts and how Sahaja Yogis have cancer. In the cancer case, the nose is removed, the tongues are removed, and Now to develop this power one has to every thing, one after the another, is develop a tremendous power of to become themselves Ekadash Rudras. removed with terrible pain. Take leprosy -detachment from negative. detachment for example, the lepers cannot feel their For example negativity can come from fingers, they cannot feel it.

The story is can destroy your power of Ekadasha. It about the Mother.

When she went into that mood the father himself Sahaja Yoga, because in the West. felt that she is bit too much angry. When specially, people are over intelligent.

That does not mean that you talk too much about Sahaja Yoga or you give lectures on that but mentally you should also understand what is Sahaja Yoga. even have such a precious thing as blessings of God. Any religion that makes you bow to anybody else but incarnation, is no religion. That is another one which is absolutely false. Your real religion will give you a balance and will always talk Today is the special day when it has been asked that we should have Ekadash Rudra about the ascent, but they will not ask for money, or make one man something Puja, and it is for all kinds of false religious sects and false Gurus and false religions which are followed in the name of God; learn to discriminate between or any religion that does not say about falsehood, negative things and real self-realisation and does not achieve self Once we develop that great and venerated. Thus we should things. discrimination through vibratory realisation and does not get connected with God. It is false. So any such thing that is just built and talks of God but has no connection with God, cannot be a true or through your intelligence; you are in control of awareness yourself and then you become that religion. Of course it gives a balance to power of Ekadasha. Then you establish people but in giving that balance if people live on that money and try to enjoy a your maturity. wealth out of that money then it is not Today I bless you all that you all become the power of Ekadasha Rudra and you develop that sincerity which takes you to even at the very low level like balance with the religion. Religion has to give you balance to begin with but in balancing that state. when they tell you that you have to be balanced, but give me money for that. May God Bless You.

That era is over now, that era of all assembled here. This is such a far- you domination, of entering into somebody fetched place away from the maddening else's land and occupying it; and crowds; is such a beautiful place which has vibrations. I selected this place suddenly from a very thick American news paper. The vibrations were just shooting out and I said what is this, considering it to be a great bravery. All that is over now. The human understanding has gone much beyond and they understand that this is sinful, this is wrong. Whatever we have done was coming from where? There was a very little advertisement and I said this the wrong. But those people are no more and place where we have to go. This place the children and the grand children of has so many vibrations, even in the those children, of these people who were advertisement. the children of God, they used to think, do not like all that. Because they have no right to take somebody's land like that So you can imagine how the guidance comes from vibrations and that's how I and occupy it as your own. Of course the was here and this place was selected by the Divine force. It happened only in one day. Such a miraculous thing happened in one day! It was taking so much time land doesn't belong to anyone. But still wherever you are born, that's your land and that Jand has to be kept with those who are born here, who own it. But this for them even to get this and suddenly I kind of aggression has been going on for told them better get it. It all worked out ages now. Now the time has come to and we are now here in the most beautiful finish this once for all, give up this kind atmosphere. of adventure, to enter into somebody's land or somebody's house and occupy it. Of course, you know that Red Indians were driven out and they came here to There is another kind of aggression, I see hide themselves. They were hiding now, is that they enter into the minds of themselves in this place so that they the people, through their talk, through

Each what is right, what is wrong and also to take to right thing. They have to accept whatever is happening around; whatever person can salvage at least thousand is immoral, whatever is destructive. One people and so many of you. If you try that it would be of a very very great has to accept because still, I think, we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja emancipation for this world which we Yogis. Who can oppose all these want to save. adventures of modern times. We have So one must know the first duty of every another kind where we find these false Sahaja Yogi now, is to save others. To talk about Sahaja Yoga; to work out Gurus who aggress, specially in America. America is really cursed that way, because Sahaja Yoga, in different places. For it had money. So all the crooks of the world came here. Just imagine! To have money itself is not a blessing. They all example now I am so surprised that they are working on children who are abused. In India, they are working out in various came here and looted rich people and have made so much money for place like prisons, Armies. So you can themselves. This kind of exploitation is enter into all kinds of activities, you can enter into all kinds of aggressed places very much dangerous; much more, because the mind gets ruined. I have seen many people were ruined, especially many and save people. But first of all I think it is the innocece which is under attack. In these western countries specially in seekers were ruined completely. I hope America, the innocence is under attack they are born again and get their self- and this is something very dangerous realization? because the children get this intution at a very young age and what will happen to The seeking is there, no doubt. But all kinds of obstacles have come, all kinds them? So we have to think of all those innocent children. What we can do for them? How we can save them? How we of temptations are there. So despite all that seeking, earnest seeking, honest seeking, they have fallen into traps, which I cannot explain, why should it have happened? But it has happened. One has can work it out? The concern has to go from yourself to others. You have get your realization, alright, you

It is just under the complete control of the Divine love. With this understanding you should now what is to be done? For what is this light enlightened here? It is for others. Now Sahaja Yogis have to live for others and not for themselves. They will have all the energy? They will have all the also know that when you are talking to Sahaja Yogis, what should be your support and they will have all the blessings. So we have to live for others. How do we live for others, is very simple. It is to have concern, concerned about attitude. How you should move? How you should talk to them? How you should understand them? How you should express your love? This is quite possible. everything, concerned about mother earth concerned about your neighbours, Itis not difficult, you should not be afraid, not feel shy. But in a sweet manner you concerned about the people who are can talk to them, you can communicate with them, you can tell them. suffering all over the world. If you read the newspaper, you will be amazed how Because this was the time, this was to happen. That's the reason Adi Shakti had things are happening, how people are suffering? to come. Without Her it would not have been possible. All other incarnations were there. But firstly they were only on one We have to understand fundamentally that unless and until transformation takes chakra and another one was there to place, we cannot change this world. And establish themselves with other people, you all can transform others. So its your with the people around. They did try, they worked it out, but it did not really work duty, its your job to transform other people and tell them what is divine love. Love is the only way now that we can in the real sense of the word. So Adi work out. It is something which should Shakti had to come, who has all of them with Her. They are all with us, all the time go into this darkness of aggression and which will give many blessings to many wanting to help you, to do every thing hearts, many people. It is an ocean of that you want to achieve. It is their will greatness. This Divine love is so great and that these holy vibrations are with you, so powerful, at the same time so very for every kind of good work you want gentle. As you can see the nature, how to do, any kind of Sahaja work you the trees grow? Every leaf gets the want to do. These vibrations will sunshine. Even tree has its own position. definitely be there to guide you, to help

 Jan - Feb. 2000 49 SHRI ADI SHAKTI PUJA The Divine Cool Breeze is a purpose. It is not just because you have done poorva punyas and all that. Many people say because of previous life we have got it. That is true. The cause may be that but the result is that now you are capable of giving realization to people you, to support you and to love you. You will be amazed how people once they start working for Sahaja Yoga! How they are blessed from every angle. So one has to decide, in their own minds that all your dreams have to come true. So only thing what you have to do is to know only and this is what you have to do. All the that your purpose of life is to spread way you have come here, in this Sahaja Yoga. Even now many Sahaja wilderness. From this wilderness only, Yogis write to me, Mother this is you will rise and you will bless all the happening to me, that is happening to me, people, specially America should be my father is like that, my mother is like blessed again and again because it is the that. But very few, Practically this is over Virata, because it is Shri Krishna's land, now. They used to write, I should say, all because people will always try to follow such letters. But now I think, they are all you, to copy you. Things will improve if you get the blessings of the previous happened. Its a very unique time where lotuses you have within yourself, no doubt. What about you doing something about it? This is what is very important. being perfected. I do not know what has there is light every where, the nature is absolutely with you. You can see how nature acts, how it is trying to help you Now only thing you have to do about and support you and how it wants to work out everything for you. It is to be just yourself is to find out about your own understood and felt that you are activities. What activities you have been something very special and that you have doing? You have to find out what have all the help, every one of you. It is not you done and what you can do? When one person, two persons. Its not ten you meditate you think about yourself. How much you have grown? What have persons. Its the whole lot. As if the whole you done? What have you given to ocean is there to help you, help you to swim over, to save so many. You have others? Whatever you got, unless and not seen such an ocean, where there is so until you distribute it, it will not increase. much depth and all the waves try to save That is a fundamental law and that works. you, to make you float in the realm of Thave seen people who are realized souls, who are very good, who know everything about Sahaja Yoga, but are not yet that much confidant, I should say, or that much joy. All this has happened to you because there

 Jan - Feb. 2000 50 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI ADI SHAKTI PUJA by his greatness can disentangle these people. They have funny ideas and those funny ideas should not deter you, should not stop you, for you know, that they are stupid they are destructive and they will deep. All of this is only possible if you yourself get into creating new Sahaja Yogis, and more Sahaja Yogis, not for popularity but for their good and for the good of the whole. I was asked that I destroy all the good qualities. You should know that the responsibility of Americans is much greater than the responsibility of any other Sahaja Yogi, because they are accepted and regarded as the most competent people as the most affective people by the Divine power. The Divine should come and stay in America. So America will improve very much. So now here I am. I came here, I stayed here and I have definitely, put in all my attention because its a very important, very very important chakra which is America. And this very important country is doing sometimes, very stupid things. power thinks that now you can go all ahead, you can do so much. And let us I would not say that you enter into politics, no. I would not say you get into any opposition and form a group, no. But you also know that you have powers, even your thought, your desire has see, like we have the power and the machinery, but the machinery if it doesn't work, what is the use of the power. That is useless, so the machinery has to work and it is working, it is spreading. But we powers. Try to experiment with it. Once you experiment, you will find out that only the attention that you put to these things, it will work out, I am sure it will have to double our efforts. I was thinking of doing some sort of a social work here so that it will go, it will be caught in the eyes of many people. On a subtler level we have worked. But now work out. It is a country which can definitely help the emancipation of the whole human beings. But on the contrary it is going the other way round. I mean American culture, I don't understand at all. What the American culture is. They say something and do something else. They have no proper value system which is accepted by everyone and which is built traditionally from days together. The value system is so convoluted, so twisted, that it is only a Sahaja Yogi, by his nobility, we have to work it on the surface, subtler level we are there, we have achieved and we can achieve much more. But we should come out of it and think, what can we do on the surface? So that people see what Sahaja Yoga is and what it can do to people. Its your personal behaviour, your collective behaviour, your national behaviour, all are going to change the atmosphere which is supposed to be

 Jan - Feb. 2000 51 The Divine Cool Breeze SHRI ADI SHAKTI PUJA superficial, so that that also becomes subtler. I have been saying this in many go, how to enter, into which area and it gets the things done. It is something you all should experience and work it out with places. But in this puja I think it is fullconfidence. It is the love that we have, important to say that. If you are really facing the Adishakti then you must know your powers are boundless. You have to just assert those powers. Its not the the concern we have. This is the power that has given us self realization and this is the power that has given us this enrichment of achievements. I am sure all stationary power but there is the movement in it and there is the right type of you are here to realize how it was done so quickly! This is one of the things that should just tell you what we are capable of doing. What we are capable of achieving. And when you think of so of movement. It knows where to enter, how to work it out? Now look at this place. Can you imagine me thinking about a place like this? But I just had in mind of course, I must say, ignorance, we should really feel from that we should have some place here inside that concern and that hankering, because American Sahaja Yogis didn't how can I help these people? And you'll have any place to meet. That's all. And see how I have got it! But the desire - to this divine power, this force will come in! do all this, should be there within your Forget about petty things and petty subtler level. Then it works, it works like problems. They are nothing. You have a magic, I tell you. Now you have faith in such a powerful thing behind you. many people who are lost in the mire of be amazed once you think like that. how yourself and decide about it. I am so very This is true that all this universe was happy that it has been achieved with such ease, unbelievable, with such ease, created, everything was created and then you were created and all that is done. But the greatest thing this power has done is to create Sahaja Yogis. This is the greatest thing. Those who have knowledge, those absolutely nothing great was done. The way we got this, was so simple that just like another Sahaja Yogi is the person IS who was to sell us, came down, so who have pure knowledge, and those who excited, and he just sold it to us, finished! We didn't have to do anything to convince him or to talk to him or reduce the price. Nothing! And he sold it out to us. In the same way whatever on a subtler level you have the Divine love in their heart, what a tremendous personality it is! Just think of that and you will get all the opportunities to express that love. desire, it becomes terrific a force which May God Bless You. moves by itself, which knOws where to

everything at the lotus feet of the Divine.
This was the one how He prepared the

we did it and still we never achieved it.
In India, there is a big cult we can call it,
people who go to Pandarpur, for one
month they walk in rags, singing the songs
and on the way they go on eating food at
different places. According to them, this
is 'Ananya" bhakti and they achieve
nothing. They have become very sick and

stupidity. And so many people come and
ask me, as I told you that how is it that
we do so much bhakti of Shri Krishna and
we have achieved nothing.
These absurd conditions you put for
human beings because they were so much
complicated. So, many people tell me,
"Mother, we are doing ananya bhakti"
How? Because we are singing on the
street, we are taking the name of God all
the time, we are going to Pandarpur, you
see, in rags and for one month we walk
singing, singing, singing. This kind of
absurd ideas about bhakti, He never gave.
So, He is the one who prepared the land

hypocrites. I just left them and sat in the
discretion in people. He thought by doing
all these things in a stupid manner, they
might develop discretion to know that this
is not the way you can achieve anything,
you have to get your self realisation.
Discretion was very important. At this
juncture when we are facing a sort of a
challenge of this new millennium, that the
car, at the right moment. That was not
such a good proposition or anything but
I could see I am buying it out of my pity
or you may call it compassion. But above
the compassion was this discretion which
said, nothing doing you better get out of
it. So, this divine discretion is a very-very
whole world is going to be destroyed and
all those things people are talking, It is
really very important to know through
discretion what is good and what is bad.
One may talk of something as very good,
something as very bad. But the Divine
discretion is very different, and it acts by
itself. Once you are in the realm of Divine
discretion you cannot commit mistakes,
even if you want to do it. I will give you
my example. We went to buy a house and
the fellow was, you see, like a beggar; he
came, he said we have nothing, we have
important thing which we should see how
it works and should be satisfied with it.
Not to feel bad that we have missed a
chance or anything but you must feel very
happy that this thing has happened and
that your divine discretion has taken on.
So, sometimes it appears that in that
divine discretion you may do something
wrong, you have done something wrong
but, if it is divine ultimately it will turn
out to be very good. I gave you a very
basic example but that is also very true
when you practice Sahaja Yoga.

things and we are just absolutely starving.
When he said that we are starving, we

The Divine discretion is extremely
important to play a very great part in our
lives, because this divine discretion gives
us the real joy of our being, of ourself, of
Sahaja Yoga. So, the third point was, for
Him, to make people joyous and happy.
But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama,
He didn't know how to do it? So, to give
people joy He said, alright let us dance,
let us sing, let us play Holi, all sorts of
things and with that He really originated

more. Immediately, you see, this
