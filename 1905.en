Talk before Mahashivaratri Puja. Pandharpur, Maharashtra (India), 29 February 1984.

In these modern times, a place which is supposed to be a holy place becomes the most unholy place. It's such a topsy-turvy condition these days. And when we are trying to establish something very fundamental that's like a little seedling that has to come out of the stones, it has to fight lots of things; so we have to keep our brains intact and be sensible about everything, and try to see what we can achieve through our patience and understanding. It's very important.

Today I think is a very great day, for all of us, because this place is the place of Virata, of Shri Vitthala. It is the place where Shri Vitthala appeared to a devoted son and when he asked Him that, "You better stand on a brick", He stood there. And they say that He stood there, waiting. Some people say that the statue that we see came out of the Mother Earth on this sand and that's what Pundarikaksh carried saying that, "These are the ones who came to see me and my parents when I was busy with them, so they are standing on the same brick which I threw".
Now the whole story has to be taken in a very sensible way, with the common-sense in it. That God Himself is capable of all kinds of miracles. We, who are created by God, are doing some things which look miraculous say, if you take about hundred year old situation of this world, we can say that today we are seeing many things which could be miraculous. Hundred years back no one could have thought that we could have all these arrangements done here in such far-fetched places.
But, all these miracles come from the Power of God. So we are the creator of that 'wee' bit - very wee bit of that miracle. So all the miracles of God cannot be explained and should not be explained. They are beyond our minds, and, to make people feel the presence of God.

God can do anything: He can move into all of the 3 dimensions and also in the 4th dimension and can do whatever He feels like. That's what you have seen now in your every day-to-day life. how many miracles take place - to all of you - and you can't understand how it works out; even it works out on things which are not living, and people are quite amazed at how these things happen. So we have to believe, now, after seeing all this ourselves, that He is God and He can do anything that He feels like; and we are nothing! We are nothing.
There should be no rationality about it - of understanding God's miracles. "How can it be? How could it be?" You can't explain. Only when you achieve that state of mind where you believe through your experiences that God is all-powerful. It's very difficult, this concept is very difficult, because we are limited people. We have limited powers. We cannot understand how God could be all-powerful, because we haven't got the capacity.
So this God who is our creator, who is our preserver, the one who desired that we should exist - who is our existence itself, is all-powerful God. All powerful. He can do whatever He likes with you. He can create another world, He can destroy this world. It's only if He has to 'desire'.

My idea of coming to Pandharpur for Shiva Puja was this: that Shiva represents the Spirit, and the Spirit is residing in all of you in your hearts.
The seat of Sadashiva is on top of your head; but He's reflected in your heart. Now, your brain is the Vitthala. So to bring Spirit to your brain means enlightenment of your brain. "Enlightenment of your brain" means: the limited capacity of your brain has to become unlimited in its capacity to realize God. I will not use the word "understand", but "to realize God", how powerful He is, how miraculous He is, how great He is.
The another is that the brain of man can create - of course, out of the dead - but, when the Spirit comes into brain, then you create living things, living work… of Kundalini. Even the dead start behaving like living, because you touch the Spirit in the dead.

Like the nucleus inside every atom or a molecule, has the Spirit of that molecule. And if you become your Spirit - we can say the 'brain' of a molecule or an atom is like the nucleus, body of the nucleus. But the one that controls the nucleus is the Spirit that resides within the nucleus. So now you have got the attention of the body - the whole body of the atom, then the nucleus, and 'inside' the nucleus is the Spirit.

In the same way, we have this body, the attention of the body. And then we have the nucleus, is the brain, and the Spirit is in the heart. So the brain is controlled through the Spirit. How? That around the heart there are seven auras - which can be multiplied into any number, seven raised to power 16 hundred -which are the ones which watch the seven chakras - raised to power 16 hundred, 16 thousand sorry.
Now this Spirit is watching through this aura - watching, I am again saying "watching" through this aura. This aura is watching the behaviour of your seven centres in your brain. Is also watching all the nerves that are working in the brain. 'Watching', again.

But when you bring the Spirit into your brain, then you go 'two' steps ahead.
Because when your Kundalini rises, She touches the Sadashiva and Sadashiva informs the Spirit. Informs in the sense - reflects, in the Spirit. So that's the first state where the watching auras start communicating to your different chakras in the brain and integrating it.
But when you bring your "Spirit" to your brain - this is the second state - then you really become Self-realised, in the full way. In the full way. Because then your Self, that is the Spirit, becomes your brain.
Action is very dynamic. It opens, then, the 5th dimension in the human being.
First when you become realized, collectively conscious, and start raising the Kundalini, you are in, you cross the 4th dimension. But when your Spirit comes into your brain, then, you become the 5th dimension - means, you become the Doer.
Our brain, now, for example says "Alright, lift this thing up". So you touch it with your hand, you lift it up. You are the doer. But when the brain 'becomes' the Spirit, the Spirit is the doer. And when Spirit is the doer, then you become a complete Shiva, Self-realized. In that state, if you get angry, you are not attached. You are not an attached person to 'anything' whatsoever. If you possess anything - you are not attached. You cannot attach, because Spirit is detachment. Complete detachment. You don't bother about any attachments whatsoever. 'Even' for a second, you are not attached.

Now, I would say, to understand the detachment of Spirit we should study ourselves very well, clearly: "How are we attached?" We are attached, firstly, by our brain. Mostly by our brain. Because all our conditionings are in our brain and all of our ego is also in our brain. So all emotional attachments are through our brain and all our egoistical attachments also are through our brain. That's why it is said that after Realization one must try to practice the Shiva-Tattwa by practising detachment.

Now how do you practice this detachment?
Because we get attached to something - of course through our brain, but through our attention. So we try to do what we call "Chitta Nirodh", is to control your attention. "Where is it going ?" In the practice of Sahaja Yoga, if you have to rise higher you have to improve your 'own' instrument and not the instrument of others. This is one thing one should know for definite.

Now, you just watch your attention, where is it going. Watch yourself. As soon as you start watching your Self, your attention, you will become identified with your Spirit. Because if you have to watch your attention you have to be your Spirit, otherwise how will you watch it? So now see: "Where is your attention going?" First, the attachment is, in all gross ways, to your body. So we see Shiva doesn't know attachment to His body: He sleeps anywhere, He goes to the cemeteries and sleeps there; because, He's not attached, He can never be caught up by any bhoot or anything; nothing of the kind. He is detached.

The detachment is to be watched and seen through your own attachments. Now, because you are realized souls, - not yet the Spirit, it has not yet come into your brain of course, but still you are realised souls - so what you can do is at least to watch your attention, you can do that. You can watch your attention very clearly, by seeing where your attention is going. And then, 'controlling' your attention, also, you can do. Very simple.
To control your attention you have to just remove your attention from 'this' to 'that.' Try to change your priorities. All this has to be done now, after realization a complete detachment. So the body demands comfort. Try to make body uncomfortable a little bit. Try. What you think it to be comfortable, try to make it a little uncomfortable. That's why people went to Himalayas. You see, coming to this place itself has caused us lot of problems. So going to Himalayas - you can imagine. So after realization they used to take their body to Himalayas: "Alright, go through all this. Let's see how you act". So what you call the penance side starts now. In a way, it's a penance which you can do very easily because now you are realized souls. With enjoyment, little, try to make this body…. For shiva, it doesn't matter whether He's in a cemetery or in his own Kailasha or anywhere.

"Where is your attention?" is, you see, that your human attention is hopelessly bad! Very entangled non-sense it is. "We did this because of this" - there is an explanation - or others have to give an explanation. No explanation is needed - to be given or to be accepted, or to be asked for. No explanation. To exist without explanation is the best way. In a simple Hindi language: "jaisé rakhahu taisé hi rahu", [than means] "Which ever way you keep me I'll remain in that state, and I wiIl enjoy". Further in this poem Kabir says "If you make me go on an elephant - means the royal conveyance - I'll go; if you make me walk, I'll walk". "Jaisé rakhahu taisé hi rahu", so no reaction on that point - no reaction. First, No explanation, [then] No reaction!

Now, second is about food. That's the first seeking human beings had as animals.
No attention on food! Whether you have salt or not, whether you have this or that, no attention on food. Actually you should not remember what you ate this morning. But we think as to that we are going to eat tomorrow. We consume food not for running this body but for a sort of a more satisfaction of tongue pleasures. Once you start understanding that pleasure is a sign of gross attention; any kind of pleasure is a very gross sensationalization (sensation), very gross it is.
But when I say "No pleasures," it doesn't mean that you should become serious people and people of sort of - as if somebody is dead in your family! But you should be like Shiva. So detached. He came on a bull, which was running very fast, to get married. He was sitting on a bull with his two feet like this, you see. And the bull is running fast and He is holding the bull; the feet like this! And He's coming for his wedding! And with Him are coming people with one eye, without noses, all kinds of funny people coming with Him; and His wife feeling quite embarrassed at the nonsensical things people are talking about Shiva.

He's not bothered what his reputation would be… but that doesn't mean that you become hippies. You see this is the problem is, that once you start thinking like that, you become hippies. Many people believe that if you try to behave like Shiva, you become Shiva.
Many believe that way, that if you take 'ganja' you become Shiva, because Shiva used to take ganja: because He was consuming all that to finish off from this world. For Him what does it matter whether it's ganja, what does it matter, give Him any thing, He'll never get drunk. No question. He's consuming all that.
Or they think, if they live like Shiva, the way He was detached about things. He was least bothered about His appearances. What appearance Shiva needs is, that whatever He appears has His beauty. He doesn't need anything to be done.

So attachment to 'anything' is ugliness. Is ugliness. Is nonsense. But you can dress up whatever way you like. Or, even if you are in the most ordinary dress, you look the most magnificent person. But it's not that if you say that, "Alright, so in these circumstances let us go about on a one sheet wrapped around."
The beauty that has "evolved" within you through Spirit, gives you that power that you can wear whatever you feel like; makes no difference to your beauty, your beauty is there 'all the time'. But have you achieved that state? And that state only you achieve when your Spirit enters into your brain. With ego-oriented people it is more difficult. And that is why they cannot enjoy things. At the slightest pretext they topple down. And Spirit, which is the source of joy, just doesn't come, doesn't show. The joy is beauty. The joy itself is beauty. But, that is a state one has to 'achieve'.

Attachments come by various methods, we go a little ahead with it. Then you have attachments of your family. What will happen to my child ? What will happen to my husband ? What will happen to my mother, to my wife, this, that nonsense. Who is your father and who is your mother? Who is your husband and who is your wife? For Shiva - He doesn't know all these things. To Him - He and His Power are 'inseparable' things. So He stands as singuIar personality. There is no 'duality. When there is duality then only you say -'my' wife. You go on saying 'my' nose, 'my' ears, 'my' hands, my, my, my, my, my,... go deep down.

Till you say my, there is some duality. But when I say "I, the nose" - then there is no duality. Shiva the Shakti. Shakti the Shiva. There is no duality. But we live throughout on our duality and because of that there is an attachment. If there is no duality what is the attachment? If you are the light and you are the lamp, then where is the daulity? If you are the moon and you are the moonlight then where is the duality? If you are the sun and you are the sunlight, you are the word and you are the meaning; then where is the duality?
But when there is this separation, there is duality. And because of this separation, you feel attached. Because if you are that, how will you be attached? Do you see that point? Because there is a difference and a distance between you and your's that's why you get attached to it. But it's me - who is the other? This whole unverse is me. Who is the other? Everything is me, who is the other? It is not that it's a brain wave or a ego brain wave. So who is the other? Nobody.

That's only possible when your Spirit comes into your brain and you become part and parcel of Virata itself. Virata is the brain, as I told you. Then 'everything' that you do - when you show your temper, when you show your affection, when you show your compassion, or anything, - it is the Spirit that is expressing. Because brain has lost it's identity. The so- called "limited" brain - it has become the unlimited Spirit.
I do not know, I 'really' do not know how to give an analogy to a thing like that. But what we can do is to understand it: that if a colour is dropped in the ocean, the ocean becomes colourful - is not possible. But - try to understand - if a little colour, limited colour, is dropped into the ocean, the colour loses its identity completely. Think of the other way round. If the ocean is coloured, and is poured into atmosphere or onto any part any little wee bit, or onto any spot, onto any atom or anything, it all becomes colourful.
So the Spirit is like the ocean which has the light in it. And when this ocean pours into the little cup of your brain, the cup loses its identity and everything becomes Spiritual! Everything! you can make everything Spiritual. Everything. You touch anything - it is Spiritual! The sand becomes Spiritual, the land becomes Spiritual, atmosphere becomes Spiritual, celestial bodies becomes Spiritual. Everything becomes Spiritual! So it is the ocean - that is the Spirit, while your brain is limited.

So the detachment from your limited brain has to be brought in. All limitations of brain should be 'broken' so that when this ocean fills that brain; it should break that little cup and 'every bit' of that cup should become colourful; the whole atmosphere, everything, whatever you look at, should be colourful. Colour of the Spirit is the light of the Spirit and this light of the Spirit acts, works, thinks, co-ordinates, does everything. This is the reason today I decided to bring Shiva-Tattwa to the Brain.

The first procedure is to take your brain towards the Shiva Tattwa by telling it: "See where are you going, Mr. Brain? You are putting attention to this. You are putting attention to that - getting involved! Now detach, become the brain yourself. Only the Brain. Detach. And then, take this 'detached' brain, 'completely' filled with the colour of the Spirit." It will automatically happen. As long as you'll have these limitations to your attention, it will not happen. So one has to 'really deliberately' do this tapasya. Every individual.

I'm with you; so you don't need any puja - that way. But that state has to be achieved, and for achieving that state, you need the puja. I hope so many of you will become the Shiva-tattwas in my lifetime.
But don't think I'm asking you to suffer. There is no suffering in this kind of an ascent, if you understand that this is the complete joyous state. That is the time when you become Niranand. That's the joy named in the Sahasrara, the name of the joy is Niranand - and you know your Mother's name is Nira - so you become Niranand. So today's worship of Shiva has a special meaning. I hope whatever we do in the outward way, in a gross way, happens also in the subtler way. I am trying to push your Spirits into your brains, but I find it rather, sometimes, difficult because your attention is still involved.

Try to detach yourself.

Temper, lust, greed, everything: try to reduce. Like in food, I told today, "Warren, ask them to eat less, not like gluttonous people". You see, once in a while, on a day of a big banquet you eat more, but you cannot eat everytime like that. It's not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Try to control. Try to control your speech: whether you express temper in your speech or you express your compassion; or you are artificially compassionate. Try to control.

I know, some of you may not do much. It's alright. I'll try to tell you - many a times; I'll try to help you - but, 'most' of you can do it. And you should try that. So on a deeper level, from today we start our Sahaja Yoga, where some of you may not attain. But most of you should try to go deeper. 'Everyone'. For that you don't need persons who are very well educated or well placed. No. Not at all. But people who meditate, dedicate, go deeper, because they are like the first roots which have to reach, for others, much deeper, so that others can follow.

Now for today's Puja we'll have a very short Ganesha Atharvasheersha. Not to wash my feet or anything much on it but is a saying of Atharvasheersha, and you can put ...... Shiva is all the time clean, pure, immaculate. So, what are you going to wash the immaculate?

One may say that "Mother when we wash Your Feet, we get your vibrations in the water".

"...But it's so detached that there is no need to wash; at a state where you get completely washed, completely cleaned out. Then we'll have a Devi Puja because Gauri who is Virgin, is to be worshipped so we'll say the 108 names of the Virgin. Then we'll do a Shiva puja.

I'm sorry I cannot tell you everything in one short speech all about this. But detachment 'must start expressing' itself in your Realization. Detachment. What is surrendering ? - is nothing. Because when you are detached, you are surrendered, automatically. When you are holding on to other things you are not surrendered, that's all.

What is there surrender to me? I am such a detached person I don't understand all that. What am I to get out of you? - I am so detached. - Nothing.

So today I hope we all pray that "O Lord, give us strength and that source of attraction by which we give up 'all' other attractions of 'all' the pleasures, of 'joy' of ego, of every thing that we think of, but we should fall into the 'pure joy' form of the Shiva-tattwa. 'Absolutely'.

I hope I've been able to explain to you why I am here today and why today is a very big day. You all who are here are specially very lucky people, who should think that God has been kind to you, that He has chosen you today to be here, to listen to this. And then, once you get detached, you'll start feeling responsible. Abhiyukta; Responsible. Responsiblity, not giving ego but responsibility which is executing by itself. Which is expressing by itself, manifesting by itself.

May God Bless you !
