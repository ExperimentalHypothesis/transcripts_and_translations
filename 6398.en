Public Program. Bucharest (Romania), 1 August 1995.


I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis and all the seekers of truth. It seems Romania is a special place where there are so many seekers of truth. And very deep and truthful they are about it. Sahaja Yoga is the power of compassion and love of God Almighty. But it's not just talk, just not giving you a lecture or a sermon, but it is actualization of the experience of this Divine Love. It is spirit-oriented, not money-oriented, nor is power-oriented. All the religions have failed outside because they are not Spirit-oriented. Now, of course, they are challenging us and saying all kinds of wrong things about us because they are frightened that they will be exposed. 


But truth will prevail now. The time has come for truth to prevail. It is surprising that people don't understand that truth is love and compassion.  If you really love somebody, you know everything about that person, that is how the Divine Love is, which knows everything about everything. It is the knowledge that you get when you fall into the ocean of love, an ocean, you fall into the love's ocean. One has to know that truth is what truth is, you cannot change it, because it is absolute. You cannot transform it, you cannot sell it. You cannot pay for it. It has to be really understood that if you have to know the truth you will know because the time has come, and that you are the human beings at the epitome of evolution.


So, this is how we are working out Sahaja Yoga in thousands. Sahaja, Saha means with, ja means born. Is born with you the right to achieve this union, this Yoga with the Divine. There is no obligation and there is no compulsion, it's all free, because it is your own power. It works spontaneously, sahaj, and also it is manifesting very fast. These are the centers which are within you and when they go into jeopardy, you get physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problem. No doubt, there are many people who are cured of incurable diseases without paying anything, without taking any medicine, with their own power.


Many people have been gifted with the esthetics. See, these are Romanian boys and how well they sing Indian songs in different languages. It's not possible. Normally it is not possible because very difficult tunes and very difficult words. But it has worked and I see in every country which have no idea of Indian language or Sanskrit are now getting all this talent to express their love. Also, Indians are singing your song, Western song, I don't know how they picked up from you. 


Then their problems are solved. Even financial problems can be solved. It is very surprising how people get their attention absolutely becoming innocent, and the attention becomes very steady. This steady attention penetrates deeply into any enterprise you take up. Thus, you become very successful in your education, in your daily life.  But the greatest success is that you become ocean, like the drop falling into an ocean dissolves. That means you become a universal being. 


Now Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations, and when they come together I've never seen them quarrelling, fighting, but they enjoy each other, whatever country, race or community they belong. Such brotherhood, such love, such oneness, unity you can see. Because who is the other? They have become part and parcel of that ocean of love, like the cells in one body. The best part of it is that when Kundalini rises She puts your genes in proper shape. So you develop Sahaj genes by which you become extremely righteous, extremely kind and honorable. You are that, no doubt, but, you see, maybe there is some sort of a problem with your genes, but once you are all right, you are great. You don't know how great you are, how fantastic you are. If you take a television in a remote village of India, those who have not seen anything like that, and tell the villagers that when it is connected you can see all sorts of things on the screen, so they will say that: "You are just telling us a story. How can that be? This looks like a little box." In the same way, we think we are little boxes, but once you are put to the mains, you discover how fantastic you are. The time has come for the whole world to change. Unless and until human beings are transformed you cannot solve the problems of this world. This is reality, one must understand. No use having big, big meetings, conferences, all kinds of things which bring forth nothing. Also, what has religion given us, outside religion? Nothing, but the idea to fight everyone thinking that yours is the best religion. 


What has science given us? Science is amoral, it has no morality about it. That's why they are creating atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, all these destructive things to kill their own fellowmen. There are no limitations of science, and it has reached such specialization, that you may have one doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye. So there is no synthesis, no synthesis. All this makes people think there might be something beyond that can happen to us. So when this power, Kundalini, which is a residual power, raises through these six centers it nourishes those centers and integrates them and then pierces through your fontanel bone area and connects you to this All Pervading subtle power for the first time. You have to experience this power. Just, say, talk about it, it's nothing but web of words. So the Sahaja Yoga is actualization of your baptism. It is not some priest comes and put water on your head and says you are baptized. So one has to understand that there is our Creator who's very anxious that we all should enter into His Kingdom. 


Now the first thing that happens to you as a result of this awakening is that you become thoughtlessly aware. Thoughts come to us from our past and future and we are not in the present. In between the thoughts, there is the space which is the present. Past is finished, future doesn't exist. But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts and we stand in the present. We are absolutely aware but thoughtless. This is called as thoughtless awareness state. Patanjali has called this Nirvichar Samadhi. 


Then the second state, where you become doubtlessly aware, when you yourself start using this power and giving Realizations to others. And you receive so many blessings that you are amazed how these miracles are taking place. Then you become doubtlessly aware, very powerful; at that stage, nobody can harm you. The Divine power looks after you and you settle in the Kingdom of God. The government of God is very efficient, alert and loving. It loves and looks after you. We have had many miracles in Sahaja Yoga. 


About a few months back there was a lady when I was in India, she wrote to me a letter saying that in her family there is some sort of a Mexican disease which everybody gets. It is a fatal disease but most of them get at the end of their life. But her son, who is young, studying in Harvard University, has got it, and that they are saying it's not curable and that he may die within one or two months. She wrote to Me three letters asking Me if she could come to India or meet Me anywhere I am. The fourth letter came saying that the son, when he went to the hospital, they found nothing wrong with him. It was really a very great miracle, I must say, the way she was doing this work for Sahaja Yoga, she is being blessed. She came to Cabella and about before at least two thousand people, she told this. 


This is what it is, that it is beyond human conception how this Divine Power could be compassionate and attending to our needs. Then, with your attention, you can know what's wrong with you: this is self-knowledge. You know about your chakras. You develop a right attitude towards yourself and you want to correct them. Also, you develop a new dimension in your awareness, which we call as collective consciousness, that is, you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips. If you can correct your chakras, your centers, you can correct others also and you can cure them without taking them to the hospital. There are three doctors in India who have got their M.D. in Sahaja Yoga for curing incurable diseases. On your fingertips, you know absolute truth. 


Like one fellow came and told Me: "I've been to church, I've seen these people have no faith in God, how can there be God and these people so bad?" I said: "All right, put your hand like this and ask a question: "Is there God? Ask three times."" And from his fingers he started feeling the cool breeze of the Divine Power, saying: "Yes, there is God." So the time has come to prove the existence of God Almighty, His Divine Love and our importance. Thus, you develop your identity. Then also, you know what is the purpose of your life, why you have come on this Earth, for what purpose the evolution took place. It is not something in the air but it is really actualization. 


I don't know but people in Romania really extremely sensitive for spirituality. In Sanskrit language, Raman means to enjoy. So now, above all you have to enjoy yourself, others and the Divine blessings. That's all you have to do, because this whole world looks like a drama, sometimes a tragedy, sometimes a comedy. But you are not involved, you just watch. And your watching with your attention is very helpful, it works out many things which normally very difficult, on a global level also. Actually you become absolutely peaceful within, the peace is within you. 


I've met many people who have got awards in peace and all that, but they are very hot tempered. All full of wrinkles, you can count them. How can they be peaceful, how can they get awards, I don't know. The source of energy is so great that you don't feel tired. As you know, I travel every third day and I'm so very old, about 73 years of age. And I am all right. So the life changes and you really enjoy human life which you [UNCLEAR could be DETESTED, or DESISTED] and also you were frustrated with it. So we create a new world of transformed people, who are innately pure, innately. You enjoy your virtues and you enjoy your Self. But there is no false pride or there is no Ego, nothing, is just enjoyment. For Sahaja Yogis, it's a festival every day. Even the children become so sweet and so beautiful. Of course, there will be people who are of false gurus and false religions and all that, they will talk against, doesn't matter. And thank you very much all of you. And My heart is full with such joy for all of you. Thank you very much! 


Now we'll have the session for Self-Realization, Kundalini awakening. And you should sit in a relaxed way, not to be tensed up about it. Of course, I cannot force Self-Realization on you and also is not meant for arrogant people or who want to just criticize us. It's not meant for idiots and stupid people. So those who do not want to have Self-Realization are welcome to leave the hall. They should leave because they should not disturb other people. To be civil to others is very important. It will hardly take ten to fifteen minutes, but one should not leave the hall when we have started this process of Self-Realization. 


So there are three conditions which are very simple. The first one is that you have to forgive yourself. At this moment, you forget your past. People say is difficult to forgive, but whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. At this juncture, when you cannot forgive, the center here on the optic chiasm is like this constricted. And at this important time if you don't forgive, the Kundalini won't be able to rise. So, why keep this myth and miss the point of your Realization? 


The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone and yourself. When you have to forgive everyone also, in the same way, if you don't forgive yourself you catch here, the center which we call as Left Vishuddhi. This is very dangerous because this can give you spondylitis, can give you angina which causes heart trouble or it may give you very lethargic organs. So we have to understand that we have to forgive ourselves. 


The third condition is also very simple, is that those who are wearing shoes have to take it out, because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Those who are sitting on the ground should also take out their shoes. But those who are sitting on a chair have to keep both the feet apart from each other like this, because there are two powers, left and right. Left is the power of our desire, mundane desire. Kundalini is the Power of pure desire. And the right side is the power of action. If you have pure desire, I'm sure it will work out. So you have to place both the feet apart from each other; on the ground, you are all right. Sit comfortably, that's all. Don't put strain on your body of bending back too much or slouching in front. You should be really pleasantly placed towards yourself. You are about to enter into the Kingdom of God. Now, somebody will show you how we'll nourish our centers. [UNCLEAR] we should say.


Please, put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, comfortably on your lap, indicating that you have desire to get Self-Realization. Now, please, put your right hand on your heart, where resides the Spirit. Now, if you become the Spirit, you become your own guide in the light of the Spirit. So now, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. Here is the center of your mastery. Now, please, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the center of pure Divine knowledge. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. You are only working on the left-hand side. Now on your heart. Now, in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. I've already told you about this center, that when it is in jeopardy, you get diseases like angina and spondilytis. Now, take your hand on your forehead across and put it down. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone, without thinking about them, in general. Now take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Now this is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Divine Power. Now the last center is very important, so stretch your palm fully, put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area. Now push back your fingers. Bend your head. You have to move your scalp seven times, slowly, clockwise. Bend your heads. Bend your heads. That's all we have to do. Now, see that your legs are apart from each other those who are sitting on a chair and the left hand towards Me. Now you have to close your eyes, so take out your spectacles. That will help. And, please, don't open your eyes till I tell you. 


Now. Put your right hand on your heart. Here resides the Spirit. Close you eyes and ask a fundamental question about yourself. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. So please ask three times: "Mother, am I the Spirit?" I've told you that when you become the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So now, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, and press it hard with your hand, with your fingers. Here you ask another fundamental question three times: "Mother, am I my own master?" I have to confess that I cannot force Divine Knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So, please, take your right hand to the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Here you have to ask six times: "Mother, please, give me pure divine knowledge." Six times, because this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure divine knowledge, your Kundalini starts rising. So now, we have to nourish our upper centers with our full self-confidence. So raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Here you have to press it and say with full self-confidence: "Mother, I am my own master." I have to tell you that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this intelligence, this ego or conditionings but you are the pure Spirit. So you have to say with full confidence, when you put your hand on your heart that: "Mother, I am the pure Spirit." Now you have to put your right hand on your heart and you have to really say with full confidence: "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."


I have to tell you that this Divine Power of love is the ocean of bliss, is the ocean of knowledge, but above all, it is a ocean of forgiveness. So, whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness. So forget the past and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say with full self-confidence, 16 times: "Mother, I'm not guilty at all." I have already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Specially at this moment, it is important that you have to forgive.  So now, raise your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. And here you have to say with full confidence again, not how many times, but from your heart: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." 


And without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine Power, for your own satisfaction. So, please, take your right hand to the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say, three times again, or maybe without counting, from your heart: "Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I've done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly." Say it from your heart. Say it from your heart. 


Now, the last center, as I told you, is the most important one. For that you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now stretch back your fingers so that there is a proper pressure on your scalp. Here again I cannot force Self-Realization on you, you have to ask for it. So now bend your head and move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly saying: "Mother, please, give me Self-Realization." Bend your heads. [UNCLEAR]


That's all. Now, please, take down your hands. Now, please, put both the hands towards Me like this, put the right hand towards Me like this, like this, not like this, like this. Now, push the right hand like this and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze like say vibrations are coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please bend your heads and see. Now, please, take your left hand like this towards Me again, projected like this and bend your head and see for yourself again, with your right hand, if there's a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations are coming out of your fontanel bone area. If it is hot that means you have not forgiven yourself or others. Some people get it far away and some closer but don't put your hand on top of your head. So forgive now, forgive yourself and forgive others. Now put the right hand towards Me and put down your head and see for your left if there's a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations are coming out of your fontanel bone area. 


Now raise your both your hands, push back your head and ask a question: "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost as described in the Bible?" Or, ask this question three times, or "Mother, is this the Divine Power of Love of God?" Or, "Is this the Paramachaitanya?" Anyone of these questions you ask three times.


Now put down your hands. Put this hand like this towards Me and watch Me and don't think. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips, or on their palm, or out of their fontanel bone area, please, raise both your hands.


That is Romania, I tell you. I bow to Romania and I bow to Romanians and to all the saints. It is very kind, really. Thank you very much! You can have a song and you can clap your hands. Once.
