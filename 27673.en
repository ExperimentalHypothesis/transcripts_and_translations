Musical Program, Ganapatipule, India, December 30th, 1985

Babamama: And this raga is very close to Mataji also. I hope you’ll all enjoy it, thank you.

 2:06:50 Shri Mataji: Now, you will hear the beautiful prophecy made by a great poet and a great saint Shri Dnyaneshwara of Maharashtra, about Sahaja Yoga. He says that: "Now, get up and walk." The forester forest of the trees of good wishes or wishful feeling: "Kalpa taru sē lāpa." [Unsure]. 

The second one he says that: "You are the talking seas and the oceans, talking oceans of amrusa." Like that, he describes the Sahaja Yogis. So, they are forest and forester, oceans and oceans. The whole thing is so beautifully said that I think it is done in Nirmala Yoga and you must have read the translation.

2:15:09

I think now it is time for us to go. We have to thank all the artists.

All the Sahaja Yogis who have been so kind to perform this beautiful evening’s program and also the people, the great artists who came from Nagpur, I don’t know whom to thank. It’s so great. From my heart, I bless all of you, I bless all the artists.

May God give them more strength, more wisdom and creativity to create the new dimension of God’s realm on this earth.

May God give you great wisdom to progress in your spirituality and your ascent, in a rhythmic musical manner.

May God bless you.
