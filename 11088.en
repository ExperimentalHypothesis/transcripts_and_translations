"This. is the era of Enlightenment; One can see and feel the bubbling of new idioms in our creative world of Art, Music and all that is beautiful and joy giving. Integration is the key note of this new regeneration of universal tones. These tones are ripples of the harmonic, dynamic undercurrent music of the Universal Divine Love."

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
