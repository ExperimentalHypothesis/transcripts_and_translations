Public program Day 1 . Leningrad (Russia), 18 August 1989.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

One has to realize that Truth is what it is. You cannot conceptualize it. You cannot organize it. And you cannot maneuver it. It is self-supporting. Now before you I have to put the theory, you can call it, or a hypothesis about what is within ourselves. In a subtle form, what we have inside and outside. We see everything - like these flowers, all that is living - and we take it for granted. But who does this miraculous work, this living work? Now you have to have an open mind of a scientist to see if this hypothesis is working or not. And if it works, then you have to accept it in your honesty. There is an all-pervading power, a subtle power, all over, that does all these miraculous living things. We have come from ameba to human stage. From ameba to human stage we have come. But still we have not reached the absolute Truth. We live in a relative world. So there are difference of opinions and difference of believes. But there is within us a power, which can connect us to this all-pervading power. And this union is a real yoga. Otherwise, all kinds of yogas are there, but they are unjust or physical or maybe little mental projections.

Now as everything is living work, our evolution is also a living work. And at a human level now, with our human awareness, there is a little breakthrough needed. This breakthrough will give us a new awareness, a new dimension. This power, which is within us, is called as Kundalini in Sanskrit language. Now in the West you have the knowledge of the trivial. But this is the knowledge of the roots. And if you do not have the knowledge of the roots, we can destroy ourselves completely. So this knowledge has to be understood. This power rests in a triangular bone called as Sacrum. Sacrum means "sacred". That means Greeks knew that there is a sacred power inside this triangular bone. So this power has to rise within us and has to break through our fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in our childhood.

Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the means, it is of no use, it has no meaning. In the same way, unless and until we are connected to the means, we too do not know the meaning of our life. When this power rises, just like a seed is sprouting, it is your mother power. It is the power of pure desire. All other desires are in general not satiable. Not satiable. Not generally satiable. Because you want to have today supposing you want to have food, tomorrow you want to have a house, the day after tomorrow a car, I don't know, then a helicopter, still you are not satisfied. And ultimately, I found, where there is too much money, then they commit suicide. So there must be something, which is a pure desire within us. We may not be aware of that power, but it exist within us. And that desire is to be one with this all-pervading power. It's subtle power.

What human beings can do is, that if there is a dead tree, we can make a furniture. From death to death. But we cannot create even the wood ourselves.

[Translating Sahaja yogi: Sorry Mother, we cannot...?]

We cannot even create the wood ourselves.

[Translating Sahaja yogi: The wood?]

Wood, I mean the tree or anything ourselves, not even the clay. But we feel we are great, because we've done some atom bombs and nitrogen bombs. That's only for our destruction. So we go into imbalances. Anything we want to have, we go into imbalances. Like, they wanted to have science; with science, it's atom bomb. Now they are having ecological problems, this problem, problems, problems, problems. The problems have increased much more than they were about hundred years back. Now we have machines and then we want to have run the machines and we run machines to such extend that we don't know what to do with them. Because you have to go on producing! Now in America, they have produced so much of plastic, they don't know what to do with it. So machines are for us, we are not for the machines. So we have lost ourselves somewhere. Because we haven't got the Truth with us.

And it is very easy to get Self-realization. To get Self-knowledge. Because it's a living process. It is so vital. It works so spontaneously. And all of you can become those super human beings, who know the Absolute. When you are connected with the Divine power, it starts flowing through you like cool breeze, from your hands. And you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. Yourself you feel it. It is a fantastic thing that is a human being. You are at the epitome of evolution. Epitome of evolution! Only you are still to be connected to the means.

The first thing that happens to you, when this Kundalini rises within you, that you get back your innocence. You get your purity of your innocence. Then, second thing that's so easy to happen is that suddenly you become very creative. It is very surprising, I have seen, people who could not even sing have become great musicians. There are very great artists, who have come out of Sahaja Yoga. Also your brain opens out and you become extremely dynamic. At the same time, you are very compassionate. And you are completely at peace with yourself. As a result of this happening, the first thing that happens to you really, is that you get cure of your elements, physical. And you know how to cure yourself and cure others.

In a medical terminology we can see that we become in charge of the parasympathetic nervous system. And all so-called incurable diseases are being cured. We have got some doctors in India, who have got MD on Sahaja Yoga [Doctor of Medicine, ed.] for curing diseases. Mentally you become so strong that all your bad habits drop out automatically. Supposing you are holding onto a snake and somebody says, "You have a snake in your hand." But in darkness you say, "No, I think it's a rope." [Shri Mataji repeating for the translator:] It's a rope. In the darkness, you see, if you are holding a snake. Snake. And somebody says it's a... But if the light comes in, he drops the snake. All right. And snakes run away. So, whatever we agree in our ignorance, just runs away from us and we become really free people. Many people, who has schizophrenia, say, also lunatics, have been cured with Sahaja Yoga. And also the absurd habits people have developed in their own ego, they get all right. I have seen many children, many students, who could'n get through in their exams, have got first class and are doing very well in India. Emotionally you become so balanced, that you have very happy married life. And you have beautiful children.

All these things happen because of your transformation. Because the Spirit, which is in your heart, comes into your attention now. And then your attention becomes very powerful. When you pay your attention to someone, you immediately know, what's wrong with that person. And once you are established fully, properly, then even a glance can do the work. But, highest of all, you become extremely peaceful and very joyous. You enjoy the comfort of the Spirit, you don't bother about other comforts. All this looks very fantastic, again, I would say. But say for a television, if you take it to a remote village in India to who have never seen it, and if you tell them that, "In this box you can see everything from different places," they'll say, "No, how can it be? It's just a box." But once you put to the mains, you see the dynamism and the beauty of that television.

That is how we are. We are great, we are glorious. But we have to be connected with the mains. That is our right, as human beings, to have it.

I would, of course, like you to ask me few questions, but there are so many people. You can ask me some questions and if you have some more, you can write them down, I'll answer them tomorrow. But there should not be any aggression, because I have not come here to take anything from you. These are your own powers. And you will be endowed with powers to give others Realization. To...

So I would request you to ask me questions, few questions, and then if you want, we can have the session of meditation, in which you can feel your all-pervading power. But should be questions, which are related to the subject.

[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a question. Is there any effect of: If you feel the diseased person and you take the disease on you and then you, being the healthy man, can you transfer this health onto him?]

Now, you don't take any diseases.

[Sahaja yogi: Sorry?]

You don't take any diseases. You are an instrument, you just note it down.

[Shri Mataji is speaking to someone about Her drink:] This is very sour, she is not understanding. First get [UNCLEAR] water. This is too sour. This is very sour for the throat.

[Sahaja yogi: So shall we continue? Or shall I translate the question, the another question?]

Read it, the question.

[Sahaja yogi: Mother, second question is: How to get rid of insomnia, lack of sleep? And the other question is: How to get the energy, if you do not have the sufficient quantity of it for you?]

I'll answer the second first. That, you don't have to decide. Your Kundalini knows everything, she is like a tape recorder, she knows you very well, she is your individual Mother. What is the first question was?

[Sahaja yogi: There was a question of: How to get rid of insomnia? And the second question was: If you don't have the sufficient quantity of energy, where to get?]

That I have said. So, the first question was "insomnia". Is curable by Sahaja Yoga. Now, we'll be having a center here in Leningrad, where you will come and we'll solve the problem for you. But in any case - maybe today - you might get your Realization maybe. You may get rid of your problems. Now, will you please write it down? It's better, systematic. What is the gentleman saying? Yes. Please. You have to be kind and civil. I am not here to get anything.

[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a question: If Kali shakti is the same as Kundalini. The question is: If Kali shakti, Mahakali shakti is the same as Kundalini shakti, and can I address this...]

No. I'll tell you tomorrow all about the chakras and the shaktis. All right? Tomorrow, in a complete lecture. I'll tell you everything. But this knowledge is Love. And even if you know everything about it by your brain, mentally, is not going to work out. It has to work out, is the point. The problem is the actualization. So by arguments and all these things you are in the web of words.

[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, the question is: Who is your teacher?]

I am myself my own teacher. And I'll make you your own teacher too. Once you have your Spirit, once have your enlightenment, you don't need a teacher at all. And you have to know that this is a living process, and anybody who takes money from you is a false master. And you cannot pay for it. Or it is also not outside, like you go on chanting or saying something. It's a happening within.

[Sahaja yogi: Mataji, there is a question. The question is: Our attitude towards Sri Aurobindo and his teaching.]

Now... You see, teachings are teachings, has no meaning to me. They must act. All mental.

[Sahaja yogi: Mataji, there is few questions.]

We'll answer you tomorrow, don't you worry. All right? Is all mental activity again. But I wanted you to ask me questions to know that your mind should not suddenly start bothering you too much. Because this mind is like a monkey, you know. It just makes you dance all the time. It's a joyless pursuit. Tomorrow I'll explain to you all these chakras and all the left and right side, sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic. And everything that you want to know about it.

Now, see, there are so many lights here. And you have to, if put them on, you have to just switch on one switch. But supposing I have to give you a lecture about the electricity, how it was discovered and brought here to Leningrad and what is the source and all. It will be just a headache to you. Better to have the light! Because it is already built-in. In the same way it's all built-in within you. So why not have your own powers? As simple as that. All right?

[Aside:] You could get somebody to stand here to show. You can get somebody to show that how to do it. To raise the Kundalini, all right? If you can get somebody, as to show. Just one of the Sahaja yogis. Someone. Some man. All right. Anyone up. You can come. Now, you can show. Is here.

Now, one simple thing we have to know. That there are two conditions for your Realization. First condition is that you have to forget the past and you are not to feel guilty for anything. Because after all, we are human beings and if you make mistakes, there is nothing to feel guilty. And this all-pervading power, which I am talking about, is the ocean of forgiveness. Now, whatever you think you have done wrong can be easily dissolved by this powerful ocean. So first you have to forgive yourself and forget your past completely. The past is finished and the future doesn't exist, so present is reality.

Now the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Some of you may think that it's difficult to forgive. But it is just a mental activity. If you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do? You just play into wrong hands. So you have to forgive. Forgive everyone. Forget the wars. Forgive the Germans. Because they are dead and gone now. Finished. [Repeating for the translator:] Germans are... they are dead. Now, if you meet the new Germans who are Sahaja yogis, they are so gentle, so kind, so beautiful. And I asked them, "How is it that the British are still very arrogant and you people are so gentle?" And they said that their forefathers never lost any war and God we lost the war, so we are in our senses. Look at the wisdom now. So forget the past and forgive everyone. That's all you have to do. It's very important. Otherwise I cannot give you Realization. I am sorry. From your heart, please, do it. All right. Now we have to take out your shoes, because you have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

[To a Sahaja yogi:] Floran, Floran, you get all the [UNCLEAR].

So now we have to know, that we have to be very pleasantly placed towards ourselves. To be... actually to love yourself and to respect. Only after Realization you will know how great you are, and how great are other people who have got Realization. The most beautiful things in this world to be enjoyed, more than flowers, are human beings. So now we have a simple nourishment of our centers, which I will show you before, and then you can close your eyes. Later on. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes. That's all. Now, you have to put both your feet apart from each other, because these are two powers, left and right. You have to be comfortably seated, not too much slouching or too much straight like that, but in a comfortable state of body. In a very pleasant mood.

Now, you have to put your left hand towards me, like this. Very comfortably. And this symbolizes your desire to have Self-realization. Now, I cannot force it on you. You have to ask for it. I respect your freedom, because ultimately you have to get the complete freedom. So I cannot force on you. Now, the right hand is to be used for nourishing your centers on the left-hand side. So first we put our right hand on our heart. If you have anything in the pocket, please take out. Will be better, it is good for you. Those, who don't want to do it, should go away. Should not disturb others by... Everyone of you have to do it. Otherwise you can leave the hall. If you don't want to do it, I cannot force on you. And it will not be civil to watch others. [For the translator:] It's not civil.

So now, put left hand towards me and right hand on your heart, please. Now, in the heart resides the Spirit. In the heart resides the Spirit. And if you are the Spirit, you become your master. So now you put your hand on the left-hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part. This is the center of your mastery. Now you have to put your hand on the lower part of your abdomen, on the left-hand side. And press it hard. Now, this is the center of your... the knowledge of the purity, or you can say the pure knowledge. Which manifests on your fingertips. As if you become a spiritual computer. Now, raise your hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Then raise it again to your heart. Then raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, as far as possible, and turn your head to your right. Put it here, nicely. Now, this center catches, when we are guilty. As a result of that, you get diseases, very dangerous diseases like angina, spondylitis. Now, you put your right hand on top of your forehead across, and put down your head. And press it on both the sides. This is the center for forgiveness. Now, you have to take back your hand on the back side of your head. Back side of your head. And push back your head as far as possible backward. This is the center for asking forgiveness of this all-pervading power. But you are not to feel guilty, or to count your mistakes. Now, you have to stretch your hand fully like this, and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, where it was soft bone. Now, you have to press it hard. And move it, seven times your scalp, slowly. You can push back your fingers. Put down your head and push back your fingers. Seven times. That's what we have to do. You have to press it hard. With the fingers outward.

Now, you will have to close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles. Until I tell you, please, don't open your eyes. Put your both the hands, feet, on the sides and one hand towards me like this, and close your eyes. Now, take the right hand on your heart. Now, here you ask a question to me, three times, which is very important. In your heart. You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like.

"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

Ask this question three times, as you would ask a computer. Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your guide, your own master. So please, take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. On the left-hand side. So now, here you ask me another question three times. Mother, am I my own master? As I've told you, that I cannot force the pure knowledge on you. You have ask for it. So now, please, put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now, here you ask six times.

"Mother, please, give me pure knowledge."

Because this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask this question, this residual power of Kundalini starts rising. So you have to open the upper centers by your self-confidence. So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here now, with full confidence we have to say ten times:

"Mother, I am my own master."

Now, one has to know that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect. You are not your conditioning or your ego nor your intellect. Because you say, "my emotions, my body." You don't say, "I body." So you are the pure Spirit. Now, raise our hand to your heart on the left-hand side and here again with full confidence, please, say twelve times:

"Mother, I am the Spirit."

Now, again I have to tell you that this great all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So please, know that whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved by this great ocean of forgiveness. So now, raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right. Turn your head to the right. And you have to say with full confidence again sixteen times:

"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

Sixteen times. I have already told you that it's a mental activity, when we say we cannot forgive someone. And whether we forgive, or we don't forgive, we don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Mentally, mentally you suffer. So now, just take your hand on your forehead across and put down your head as much as your can on that hand. And press it, press it on both the sides. Press it on both the sides and here... and here you have to say:

"Mother, I forgive all the people, everyone."

Do not count whom you have to forgive. Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head upward. Here you have to say, without counting your mistakes, without counting your guilt, just you have to say for your own satisfaction, from your heart, not how many times, your have to say that,

"Oh, all-pervading power, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me."

Now, stretch your hand and take your hand on top of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone. Push back your fingers, put down your head. And - put down your head. Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for... You have to ask for your Self-realization. So move your scalp so many times, slowly, saying:

"Mother, please, give me Self-realization."

Now, please, take down your both the hands and slowly open your eyes. Put both of your hands towards me like this. Watch me without thinking, you can do it now. Now, bend your head and see for yourself with your left hand, if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. There might be some hot, doesn't matter. Now, put your left hand towards me, put down your right hand and see for yourselves. Again once more, please, put down your head and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze. Now, you take both your hands up like that, push back your head. And ask me a question:

"Is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading power of Love?"

Please, ask this question three times. Now, take down your hands please. All those, who have felt cool breeze out of their heads or in their hands, or even hot breeze coming out, please raise your both the hands. Both the hands. [My God!] Both the hands. The whole of Russia has got Realization!

Now, just put your hands like this and ask the question: "Mother, is Russia going to be the greatest spiritual country?"

It is true. It is true, I know that. And best - if it's true, the vibrations will increase, the cool breeze is here. Ask this question three times.

All right? It's true.

May all of you be blessed.

And I'll come again tomorrow to explain to you. But now, now you should go in peace and silence and don't discuss it, don't think about it. Otherwise you'll loose it. Those who haven't got it will get it tomorrow, and those who have got it, their connections will be fixed.

Thank you very much.

And now you all know yourself and enjoy! This is our religion: To know ourselves and to enjoy.
