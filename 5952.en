Advice at Dollis Hill ashram, London, England. 16 March 1980.

[missing part] greatness. It’s nice today. It’s Mother’s Day, and I find so many people waiting for Me. And also you see yourself as a mother, the heart is expanding [to it] and you can’t get out of some things. And then you enjoy that [pile] and that longing to see your own, your own children whom you love so much. This is a great joy in these modern times; it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won’t be respected and won’t be respectable either. It’s a fact. And imagine now this has brought this Mother’s Day to this country. It’s something, such a recognition from the Divine, that one has to remember that motherhood is very important. It is the Mother who created the universe; the Father was just a witness to the whole joy. It is She works it out the whole thing. It is She makes it beautiful so that He sees the show, that He becomes the spectator, because She loves Her creation. 

The Father wants that it should be such that He should be able to love it. He’s a perfectionist. He wants everything to be perfect. But a Mother accepts as the child is, because that is Her own creation. If there is a defect in the child She accepts that defect as Her own and She works for it; She works very hard.  It’s no sacrifice, because you enjoyed. You enjoy doing that. You enjoy working for your children. And if it was not so, this world would never have existed. You know what untold things mother has to bear when the child is to be born. Actually it is [a/her] test of her love why she could have done that. Still she goes on with it because she wants a child. But when this motherhood is spoilt in its image, then the mothers are no more mothers; they are not respectable. Then they are not respected. And when the children don’t respect their mothers because they have no respect for anything else whatsoever. And the first thing and the last thing is the respect for the mother. If one does not respect the mother, or the motherhood, that means he has no respect for himself either. Then how does he exist? He exists through his mother. So, mother is a very, very important institution for the whole creation, for your creation and for the creation of your children and all the progeny that has to come. 

Now let us see what does the Mother provide us with, what part of our being She is. I would say that She is everything. But your personal mother who has given you this birth, this body. This is your own mother whom you know very clearly that she is your mother. As you know, she gives you the nourishment when you are in a fetus stage, and later on when you grow up she, she gives you all the physical nourishment that is needed for your growth and she enjoys it. Otherwise she feels over-burdened. She wants to give it. And everyone appreciates that. It’s a collective enjoyment, it’s going on and it could be seen from all the paintings of the world, all over the world in every language, in every country, every religion.  The mother and the child has been the main theme of paintings and expression of the most joyous moments for painters. Poets also have written such a lot on that. Everywhere of manifestation of joy, in all the human endeavor has been on this scene, revolving on this scene. But the mother who is your own mother, whom you know as your mother, who gives you physical birth, is the mother who gives you much more than you know of. Because her blood has her vibrations, and when she gives you her blood she gives you her vibrations, she gives her sustenance, she gives you her desires and also she gives you a push in your evolution if she is an evolved person. 

Now, in mother and the child relationship, mother gives a lot. She gives, makes your complete left side. She creates all that left side in you, because she has [desires/desired] for you; so she creates that. On the right side she gives you all the beauty of delicacy and also the hunches that you get in your business or all the flexible moments of your life that you think, “From where unknown I got something?” That’s your mother’s blessing for you. You choose your own mother, too, when you are born. So no use just condemning your mother because she’s like this, she’s a horrid woman, and she’s this and that and that. Now, you have chosen her; so better have it. And she is a very big part of you, I must say. But she has to be also something to be a mother. It’s the most responsible position is that of a mother. It is even a much more responsible than that of a king − I mean, to be a mother − because the king can only go up to material level or up to physical level. And up to rational level at the most a philosopher can go. And the emotional level may be fulfilled by the wife. All these things may be done by other people, but spiritual level you can only achieve from your mother’s [nature/side]. 

Any hampering you get in your spiritual ascent could be from so many other problems but basically could be from your mother’s side. So mother also can give you her nervousness, she can give you her irritative nature, she can give you her bad temper, she can give you a very cunning nature. She can give you all that is bad in her, just in a [bundle/abundance]. But you can also give her back something special. Supposing a child which is a realized soul is taking birth in a mother and the, if the mother is not a realized soul, then the child will try to clear the Nabhi of the mother and give her lots of vomiting, like you see, it clears out, or diarrhea or something like that and try to clear the Nabhi and the Void of the mother. If she has been going to some guru and all that, the child will take full care to see that she gets rid of all the bad things she has received from [the/a] bad guru. And tremendous things happen when a woman conceives a realized soul. But even a non-realized soul, when a mother’s conceives, her face [just] starts glowing because, see, she is creating something. It’s the special blessings of God comes on her. But as a Sahaja yogi, when you are reborn as Sahaja yogi, you have your vibrations. Then what you do is to give back to your mother by giving her realization. Giving realization is an obligation, which cannot be repaid back. Every obligation of this world can be repaid back and the last obligation, is the obligation of mother giving you birth on this earth, can be also repaid back by giving her, her own second birth. You becoming the mother of your mother is the best way you can repay her back. And so, [though it is a, very] difficult thing under the circumstances as they are.  

I know you are all quite worried about this. Not easy, because due to war or whatever it is, in the Western countries the mothers have lost their positions, they have lost their moorings, they have lost their significance and they think they have not been all right as mothers. They think they have not been very helpful to the society by only by being mothers. But they can be brought round gradually by showing that you are so significant yourselves and that they are the mothers. They are the mothers who have brought you to this world. Once they start realizing that significance within themselves, I am sure it will work out. And that’s how you are going to repay back. And once you have done it, you have done the job. So you don’t have to worry about the other things. You have repaid it. So be happy about it, those who have done that, and those who have not done it will be doing yet. So on this day of Mother’s Day I would like to bless you that now you have to give birth to so many thousands of people. So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment. May God bless you. 

Are you better now? So now, what is it?

Reporter: Vibratory awareness. Now I need to place you in collective consciousness, the second birth. The places we call the hippy trend in the 60’s with yellow roads and the solemn gurus.  [And today, After those days] it’s [all] going very strong], and today a new book is published to claim yet another new dawn to [call as] very good things to [present] out. The book is called “The Advent” and it deals with the vibratory awareness available through something called Sahaja Yoga and has been congratulative written by Gregoire de Kalbermatten of the Swiss diplomatic corp. Built in its London [precincts] [at/to] India House of the Indian High Commissioner and to the founder of Sahaja Yoga, Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi. And it’s very true and he set out to meet the lady [who is/he’s] not yet vibratory [unclear]. 

Another reporter: The [movement/London] starts with Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi [unclear] [documents have been personally decorated with tapestries and traditional Indian wood carvings?]  [Unclear]. 

The lady was introduced: Shri Mataji which means Mother. [So the/A] plump middle-aged woman dressed in a sari [unclear] [speech/and here over tea and Indian sweets] we discussed how to achieve vibratory awareness. And here comes the difficult part: in a debate lasting several hours She parried all my objections [with/through] Her talk of thoughtless awareness and [evolutionary moot] with simple solutions. Then how is it done? The answer it seems, is Sahaja Yoga, the releasing of the potential in every human being but [for their] spiritual integration. I sat on an armchair, palms upwards, and Mataji made these curious passes over my hand − in fact various parts of my head − in an effort to encourage my natural [life/vital] force [to expand it from within me].  She [claimed/told me] she could see it; I certainly couldn’t. She told me I had sinus trouble, which is true, and liver problems which [such] as far as I know is not. I did feel relaxed, peaceful, exalted. Shri Mataji explained the benefits of vibratory awareness. 

Shri Mataji: You’ll get complete integration of your mental, physical and emotional being. Secondly, your mental, emotional, physical being is completely benefited because you get connected with the main source. For example, if you are going by a car and if your petrol is finished, then you built up a tension. But if you are connected to a source, from where the energy is all the time coming, all your mental, physical, emotional energy is coming from one source, and if that is opened out, in the medical terminology if you can master your parasympathetic nervous system, then there is no problem coming. And all the time you are [getting] dynamic and you start working the twenty-four hours. Also, you don’t feel tired and you are absolutely relaxed. The tensions are lost and your diseases, [especially your, physical] diseases disappear, [your / emotional] problems disappear and you become a very [normal/healthy] person. 

Interviewer: This sounds absolutely marvelous, [it sounds so easy] and why isn’t everyone doing it? 

Shri Mataji: It’s the easiest thing [that anyone can do, people don’t want to do]. You see, if I tell people to stand on their heads they will be very happy. They’ll pay money for that if I tell them to stand on their heads. You see, people don’t want to do easy things because that challenges their ego. 

Interviewer: Do you charge for your knowledge? 

Shri Mataji: Not at all. What can you pay for love? You can’t pay [single pie] for God’s love. It’s so perfect.

Interviewer: [unclear] quite hard to swallow, and so I was surprised to learn that the is endorsed by the Indian High Commission [unclear] Indian Government.  Mataji is not the first Indian guru who claims to give increased awareness. [Religious or psychological jargon Indian] [Yoga itself] is quite acceptable [nowadays/these days]. But how is Shri Mataji’s new method [is] different [all the from, from all the] others [as that is supposed to be an escape to the nonsense]?  

Shri Mataji: Some of them are robbers, some of them are fakes, some are affected [unclear]. I agree that they entirely that exists but if there is a method which is fake [unclear], must be of these people,  there must be something genuine also because if you find so many fake people, then everything fake must have some genuine basis and there must be something genuine. The only trouble is how to go about it? How do you find [out/that] the reality? You need a proper understanding what you have to find out, what is an experience, all that you must know, you must be very strict about it, and then only you can find out. But if you are nice they can make money out of you. Why not? That’s how they are. They’re all just like that.

Interviewer: So why then should I or anyone else listen to [this belief, those believes] that You have something to offer? 

Shri Mataji: You see, because I don’t want you to believe, as I have told you. You don’t have to believe into anything. You have to experience it. The power is to experience. You don’t have to believe into it at all. There is no need to believe but you should [unclear]. Keep your eyes open just like [unclear]. But to say that this is a new idea, it’s not true because this has been there. You are your own guru. Everybody has said that you are guru, is within you. Only thing, is just to be awakened. I’m not a guru. I’m just a Mother.

Interviewer: [And that is] Mrs. Mataji Nirmala Devi.
