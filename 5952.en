Advice at Dollis Hill ashram, London, England. 16 March 1980.

[missing part] greatness. It’s nice today. It’s Mother’s Day, and I find so many people waiting for Me. And also you see yourself as a mother, the heart is expanding [to it] and you can’t get out of some things. And then you enjoy that [pile] and that longing to see your own, your own children whom you love so much. This is a great joy in these modern times; it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won’t be respected and won’t be respectable either. It’s a fact. And imagine now this has brought this Mother’s Day to this country. It’s something, such a recognition from the Divine, that one has to remember that motherhood is very important. It is the Mother who created the universe; the Father was just a witness to the whole joy. It is She works it out the whole thing. It is She makes it beautiful so that He sees the show, that He becomes the spectator, because She loves Her creation. 

The Father wants that it should be such that He should be able to love it. He’s a perfectionist. He wants everything to be perfect. But a Mother accepts as the child is, because that is Her own creation. If there is a defect in the child She accepts that defect as Her own and She works for it; She works very hard.  It’s no sacrifice, because you enjoyed. You enjoy doing that. You enjoy working for your children. And if it was not so, this world would never have existed. You know what untold things mother has to bear when the child is to be born. Actually it is [a/her] test of her love why she could have done that. Still she goes on with it because she wants a child. But when this motherhood is spoilt in its image, then the mothers are no more mothers; they are not respectable. Then they are not respected. And when the children don’t respect their mothers because they have no respect for anything else whatsoever. And the first thing and the last thing is the respect for the mother. If one does not respect the mother, or the motherhood, that means he has no respect for himself either. Then how does he exist? He exists through his mother. So, mother is a very, very important institution for the whole creation, for your creation and for the creation of your children and all the progeny that has to come. 

Now let us see what does the Mother provide us with, what part of our being She is. I would say that She is everything. But your personal mother who has given you this birth, this body. This is your own mother whom you know very clearly that she is your mother. As you know, she gives you the nourishment when you are in a fetus stage, and later on when you grow up she, she gives you all the physical nourishment that is needed for your growth and she enjoys it. Otherwise she feels over-burdened. She wants to give it. And everyone appreciates that. It’s a collective enjoyment, it’s going on and it could be seen from all the paintings of the world, all over the world in every language, in every country, every religion.  The mother and the child has been the main theme of paintings and expression of the most joyous moments for painters. Poets also have written such a lot on that. Everywhere of manifestation of joy, in all the human endeavor has been on this scene, revolving on this scene. But the mother who is your own mother, whom you know as your mother, who gives you physical birth, is the mother who gives you much more than you know of. Because her blood has her vibrations, and when she gives you her blood she gives you her vibrations, she gives her sustenance, she gives you her desires and also she gives you a push in your evolution if she is an evolved person. 

Now, in mother and the child relationship, mother gives a lot. She gives, makes your complete left side. She creates all that left side in you, because she has [desires/desired] for you; so she creates that. On the right side she gives you all the beauty of delicacy and also the hunches that you get in your business or all the flexible moments of your life that you think, “From where unknown I got something?” That’s your mother’s blessing for you. You choose your own mother, too, when you are born. So no use just condemning your mother because she’s like this, she’s a horrid woman, and she’s this and that and that. Now, you have chosen her; so better have it. And she is a very big part of you, I must say. But she has to be also something to be a mother. It’s the most responsible position is that of a mother. It is even a much more responsible than that of a king − I mean, to be a mother − because the king can only go up to material level or up to physical level. And up to rational level at the most a philosopher can go. And the emotional level may be fulfilled by the wife. All these things may be done by other people, but spiritual level you can only achieve from your mother’s [nature/side]. 

Any hampering you get in your spiritual ascent could be from so many other problems but basically could be from your mother’s side. So mother also can give you her nervousness, she can give you her irritative nature, she can give you her bad temper, she can give you a very cunning nature. She can give you all that is bad in her, just in a [bundle/abundance]. But you can also give her back something special. Supposing a child which is a realized soul is taking birth in a mother and the, if the mother is not a realized soul, then the child will try to clear the Nabhi of the mother and give her lots of vomiting, like you see, it clears out, or diarrhea or something like that and try to clear the Nabhi and the Void of the mother. If she has been going to some guru and all that, the child will take full care to see that she gets rid of all the bad things she has received from [the/a] bad guru. And tremendous things happen when a woman conceives a realized soul. But even a non-realized soul, when a mother’s conceives, her face [just] starts glowing because, see, she is creating something. It’s the special blessings of God comes on her. But as a Sahaja yogi, when you are reborn as Sahaja yogi, you have your vibrations. Then what you do is to give back to your mother by giving her realization. Giving realization is an obligation, which cannot be repaid back. Every obligation of this world can be repaid back and the last obligation, is the obligation of mother giving you birth on this earth, can be also repaid back by giving her, her own second birth. You becoming the mother of your mother is the best way you can repay her back. And so, [though it is a, very] difficult thing under the circumstances as they are.  

I know you are all quite worried about this. Not easy, because due to war or whatever it is, in the Western countries the mothers have lost their positions, they have lost their moorings, they have lost their significance and they think they have not been all right as mothers. They think they have not been very helpful to the society by only by being mothers. But they can be brought round gradually by showing that you are so significant yourselves and that they are the mothers. They are the mothers who have brought you to this world. Once they start realizing that significance within themselves, I am sure it will work out. And that’s how you are going to repay back. And once you have done it, you have done the job. So you don’t have to worry about the other things. You have repaid it. So be happy about it, those who have done that, and those who have not done it will be doing yet. So on this day of Mother’s Day I would like to bless you that now you have to give birth to so many thousands of people. So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment. May God bless you. 

Are you better now? So now, what is it? 

BBC Radio Broadcast

Reporter: Vibratory awareness. Now I need to place you in collective consciousness, the second birth. The places we call the hippy trend in the 60’s with yellow roads and the solemn gurus.  [And today, After those days] it’s [all] going very strong], and today a new book is published to claim yet another new dawn to [call as] very good things to [present] out. The book is called “The Advent” and it deals with the vibratory awareness available through something called Sahaja Yoga and has been congratulative written by Gregoire de Kalbermatten of the Swiss diplomatic corp. Built in its London [precincts] [at/to] India House of the Indian High Commissioner and to the founder of Sahaja Yoga, Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi. And it’s very true and he set out to meet the lady [who is/he’s] not yet vibratory [unclear]. 

Another reporter: The [movement/London] starts with Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi [unclear] [documents have been personally decorated with tapestries and traditional Indian wood carvings?]  [Unclear]. 

The lady was introduced: Shri Mataji which means Mother. [So the/A] plump middle-aged woman dressed in a sari [unclear] [speech/and here over tea and Indian sweets] we discussed how to achieve vibratory awareness. And here comes the difficult part: in a debate lasting several hours She parried all my objections [with/through] Her talk of thoughtless awareness and [evolutionary moot] with simple solutions. Then how is it done? The answer it seems, is Sahaja Yoga, the releasing of the potential in every human being but [for their] spiritual integration. I sat on an armchair, palms upwards, and Mataji made these curious passes over my hand − in fact various parts of my head − in an effort to encourage my natural [life/vital] force [to expand it from within me].  She [claimed/told me] she could see it; I certainly couldn’t. She told me I had sinus trouble, which is true, and liver problems which [such] as far as I know is not. I did feel relaxed, peaceful, exalted. Shri Mataji explained the benefits of vibratory awareness. 

Shri Mataji: You’ll get complete integration of your mental, physical and emotional being. Secondly, your mental, emotional, physical being is completely benefited because you get connected with the main source. For example, if you are going by a car and if your petrol is finished, then you built up a tension. But if you are connected to a source, from where the energy is all the time coming, all your mental, physical, emotional energy is coming from one source, and if that is opened out, in the medical terminology if you can master your parasympathetic nervous system, then there is no problem coming. And all the time you are [getting] dynamic and you start working the twenty-four hours. Also, you don’t feel tired and you are absolutely relaxed. The tensions are lost and your diseases, [especially your, physical] diseases disappear, [your / emotional] problems disappear and you become a very [normal/healthy] person. 

Interviewer: This sounds absolutely marvelous, [it sounds so easy] and why isn’t everyone doing it? 

Shri Mataji: It’s the easiest thing [that anyone can do, people don’t want to do]. You see, if I tell people to stand on their heads they will be very happy. They’ll pay money for that if I tell them to stand on their heads. You see, people don’t want to do easy things because that challenges their ego. 

Interviewer: Do you charge for your knowledge? 

Shri Mataji: Not at all. What can you pay for love? You can’t pay [single pie] for God’s love. It’s so perfect.

Interviewer: [unclear] quite hard to swallow, and so I was surprised to learn that the is endorsed by the Indian High Commission [unclear] Indian Government.  Mataji is not the first Indian guru who claims to give increased awareness. [Religious or psychological jargon Indian] [Yoga itself] is quite acceptable [nowadays/these days]. But how is Shri Mataji’s new method [is] different [all the from, from all the] others [as that is supposed to be an escape to the nonsense]?  

Shri Mataji: Some of them are robbers, some of them are fakes, some are affected [unclear]. I agree that they entirely that exists but if there is a method which is fake [unclear], must be of these people,  there must be something genuine also because if you find so many fake people, then everything fake must have some genuine basis and there must be something genuine. The only trouble is how to go about it? How do you find [out/that] the reality? You need a proper understanding what you have to find out, what is an experience, all that you must know, you must be very strict about it, and then only you can find out. But if you are nice they can make money out of you. Why not? That’s how they are. They’re all just like that.

Interviewer: So why then should I or anyone else listen to [this belief, those believes] that You have something to offer? 

Shri Mataji: You see, because I don’t want you to believe, as I have told you. You don’t have to believe into anything. You have to experience it. The power is to experience. You don’t have to believe into it at all. There is no need to believe but you should [unclear]. Keep your eyes open just like [unclear]. But to say that this is a new idea, it’s not true because this has been there. You are your own guru. Everybody has said that you are guru, is within you. Only thing, is just to be awakened. I’m not a guru. I’m just a Mother.

Interviewer: [And that is] Mrs. Mataji Nirmala Devi. 

Third talk: Untitled 

Shri Mataji: When it grows, in that growth you have to become a wider personality and a wider personality. With the marriage you become even a better person and you develop a better personality. Now, why marriage is necessary for Sahaja yogis? First and foremost thing, it is the most normal thing to do, is to marry. God has given you this desire, to be married for some purpose. But the same desire, if you do not use it for the purpose it is given, it can become a perversion, can become a nasty thing which can be very detrimental to your growth. So one should understand this desire within us to have a marriage. Marriage means wife who is a part and parcel of your being, a wife on whom you can depend. She’s your mother, she’s your sister, she’s your child, she’s everything. You can share all your feelings with your wife. So it is important that the wife should be such that she should understand that this is the need of a marriage. 

Now in Sahaja Yoga, as you have seen, all of you have problems either of the left or the right. Now when these marriages will take place mostly spontaneously, it will happen by the nature’s plan itself that you will marry a person who is a complementary personality to you. Because supposing you are a left-sided person and if you have a person who has a left side which is very strong, it will compensate and that’s how you’ll make a good marriage. But for that, one thing is very important, that you must share. You must share life, every bit of it, every moment of it. If you do not know how to share life, it’s going to be very, very difficult. When it comes to love, how do we express our love? By sharing all our joys, all our pains, all our problems. But in Sahaja Yoga it’s little more, I think, quite a lot more, much more. Here you have to share the community. The marriage is not for the individuals in Sahaja Yoga, not at all. If anybody has this feeling that the marriage is between two persons in Sahaja Yoga, it’s a wrong thing. It is two communities. It can be two nations. It can be completely two universes. 

So it is not to be enjoyed between yourselves. If you are good husband, wife to each other, is not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga. That love should be enjoyed by everybody else, in the society, in the community. If you cannot do that, then you have not achieved Sahaja Yoga marriage. It’s just an ordinary marriage as people have. It’s nothing special about it. Such marriage should be able to give chances for very great souls to come on this earth. A person who is married in Sahaja Yoga, who are Sahaja yogis, who are sharing their love equally with the Sahaja yogis, yogis and the society that is Sahaja Yoga, then only great people will be born. I would say Bogdan has done that. Bogdan and Mandy, they have done it. It’s something surprising. You see, they, they were engaged before marriage. They were married before Sahaja Yoga. They were married after realization. And I don’t know how it has clicked in their life that they really share companionship with other Sahaja yogis. Whenever he writes to Me, he always writes about other Sahaja yogis. They’ll ask about every one of them, how are they, what are their problems. Unless and until it happens, the marriage has no meaning in Sahaja Yoga at all; no meaning. So, first test of a Sahaja yogi marriage is how much you have been able to share by this marriage with other people. 

Now, for example, in a normal marriage a man is the person who is the head of the family, as you say. Now he has to be the head. The man has to be head for certain reasons. There is nothing wrong in man becoming the head. It’s all right. You become the heart. Heart is more important than head is. Perhaps you do not realize that, how heart is important. You see, even if the head fails the heart can go on. We can go on always until the heart is going on. But if the heart fails, the head fails, too. So you are the heart as a woman, and he is the head of the family. Let him have that feeling that he is the head. It’s a feeling, just a feeling. Like the head always feels that he decides. But is the brain that also knows that it’s the heart one has to cater for. It’s the heart which is all-pervading, which is the real source of everything. So the woman’s position, if she understands how important it is, she would never feel let down or dominated if she knows she is the heart. I think this is the point people, women specially in the West have lost and have forgotten and have not realized.  If they had realized this point there would have been much less problem. 

You see, it is not the way people think they control others or dominate others or sort of try to suppress them. It is not that way. It is the heart which really governs everything. Heart rules out everything else. It is heart which has got the power to envelop the brain to soothe it. Brain is a headache, you know. It works, works like mad, but heart is the one which can really cover the whole body with its love and can soothe it, can give joy and happiness. It is the heart which contains the Spirit. So heart, it’s a very important thing, which is the power of the body. Like, ultimately, you have to become the Spirit, which is in the heart. With brain you know things, and that’s why the man has to be the head. He has to go out, he has to work, he has to deal with people. His life is, he’s an extravert, as you call it. And woman also has to work sometimes if there’s difficulties and troubles are. But a woman should not feel dominated if the man says, “All right, you don’t work,” but if he says it in love. 

Now if the brain starts dominating the heart too much, what will happen? Then, there will be dryness. You see, like many men are very meticulous, very particular, very. They are headaches, absolute headaches to themselves, to others and to the whole society. Such people can become extremely dry and they can be all the time, you see, like they can never enjoy their wives, they can never enjoy their children, they cannot enjoy anything whatsoever. Because you see, they are so particular. Like they said, “Come at five ten.” Now if you reach there at five nine or five eleven you had it. They are just watching the time, just to find out faults. You see, as soon as the wife comes in they will be shouting, “What, you’ve come so late”, “How many?”, “Forty-five seconds”.  Lost. You see, the wife is coming. They expect and see the meeting of it, the joy of it. You are going to meet your own heart. It’s lucky. Now this brain can go all off the rule. You see, it can go on, and it can be very, very taxing. It’s, creates tremendous problems within. So heart must be respected. Heart must be obeyed. That’s the point, you see: heart must be obeyed. But that doesn’t mean that the women should dominate men. It doesn’t mean that. Obeyed means you must understand what your love says. See, do it in love. If you do it in love, is very good. 

For example, I am lecturing you morning till evening. You are not tired of My lectures. Normally, people should be. “What’s this sermon going on, this lady all the time talking to us?” But you do not mind it, for one reason. Why? Because you know I love you very much. In the same way the woman must establish the rule that she loves. The man may become little funny but he’ll come along. He’ll go little astray but he’ll come along. But do not judge him in outward domination. Like, you see, if he says, “This color is not good.” “All right, whatever you will like. I’ll put it.” Then himself, he’ll say, “Oh, I think the one you had put was good, you know. I was really [furious/foolish].” See, he would say like that. You just agree to them, you know. I mean, I have experimented this in My own life. You see, I’ve done it. 

You see, for example, say, my husband doesn’t know much of roads, you see. So supposing you are going somewhere, and he says, “No, I think this is the way you have to go.” I [say/said], “All right, you can go ahead,” and I’ll walk with him. But I [say/said], “No, but I think it’s not the road.” I’ll have to walk again back I know for definite but, “All right, if you want I can walk with you.” All right, I am walking. I am just enjoying. I may have to go this way only. So it is. Then he starts wondering, “Is it true? Is it correct?” Then he starts thinking, you know, that, “Is it really?” or maybe, because She has instincts you see, She has intuition, She has so many things, She, She gets that, what you call, a, there’s a word in English, for that also, you get a hint you know, suddenly, a hint, that hitch, they call it as hitch, you see they get a hitch. And that’s, that comes out to… Ah?  What is it? Hunch, hunch, hunch, they get a hunch; they get a hunch of it. And that’s what it is. And once they start understanding that hunches of the wife is correct, then they follow her in a way. But what is so great in making your husband follow you? It’s wrong. I need, there’s no need for him to follow. “You go this way.” What is the need to do all that? We are going the same way. But we must know that somebody is on the left; one is on the right.   The left has to be on the left. Supposing the left will start going to the right we’ll have only one wheel left. What are we going to do about it? 

We are all going on the same way. There are no two ways about it. There are two wheels needed to give it a balance. But we are going on the same way. This, people don’t realize. They think one wheel has to go on the right; another has to turn on the left. So imagine what will be the condition of such a family. We are going on the same way. Only understanding is needed, that one has to live with the powers of heart and another has to live with the powers of rationality, of understanding.  Now, when it comes to rationality, ultimately it will turn to heart. Because it reaches a point when it does not know, you see, then it comes to heart. Once women realize this, that they have this within themselves, but you must nurture your power of heart. You must not to compete with them in everything, you see. “He goes on the horse. Why can’t I?” “You see, he does this. Why can’t I?”, “If he can drive, I can drive.” You see, wisdom lies in doing things, many things, by avoiding them. You see, for example, I don’t drive. So everybody drives me along. I don’t type. Very good, everybody types for Me. But I do some things which nobody can do well, as well as I can do, like I can cook very well.  So when it comes to cooking they have to come to Me. It’s like that. But you don’t do everything that the men want to do, or you don’t do everything women want to do. For men will be cooking, and women will be driving. It’s a wrong thing. 

Men should know all manly things, and women should know womanly things. They must learn. They must put their heart into it. I mean, women can be equally intelligent; men can be equally intelligent. Women can go onto the right hand, and men can go on the left hand, no doubt about it. But you put imbalance to the whole universe by that; that’s the point. It’s not that by doing that you are in any way less or more. This idea should go out of your minds absolutely. That men think that, “Oh, I am the man who wears the pants.” “All right, you wear the pants but we wear the beautiful skirts, all right.” That’s the way it should be looked after. You see, once this goes away, you see, Sahaja Yoga will work out better. The domination only is felt when there is no love. You see, sometimes you like people to dominate you, isn’t it? For example, they say, “Come along, have this food. Must eat, must have this.” [You] like it, because somebody cares for you. There’s a concern. Somebody loves you, wants you to have this and wants you to do that. And you like such a person. You want somebody to do that. You do not want to be left to dogs, that, “Do whatever you please.” That kind of a thing is no good, and once you develop that feeling that, “Oh, that person cares for me,” you see, “that person loves,” then you will start also caring for the feelings of that person. You also start understanding. 

Now again the guilt is working. Now will you please stop feeling guilty about anything? I do not say these things to find you, make you feel guilty, but just to understand that you have to be in a very light mood, in a very light mood. This balance has been created long time back, very long time back. Say, even when Radha, Krishna existed, Radha was the power and Krishna was the one who was expressing. This is the, as you say, the potential and the kinetic. And people only know about Krishna, but Radha was the power. When He had to kill Kaunsa He had to ask Radha to do it. It was She who did everything. She had to dance. And He pressed Her Feet. He said, “Now You must be tired.” Why did [You/She] dance? Because without Her dancing, things could not work out. So, it is so interdependent. It’s so interdependent, as you cannot have a wick and you cannot have the light. You cannot have these two things separate. If you can understand that, then this balance is completely harmonious, which is between God and His power.  Absolutely one, can’t imagine. How it is one with God and His Power. His Power, His desire is the same as God. There’s no difference at all. But in human beings you are disintegrated people. Your desire is different, your thinking is different, your asking is different. Everything is so disintegrated. That’s why you cannot understand. That’s why marriages are also disintegrated. The complete integration is the intermingling. If the wife has to work, one need not worry. If the man has to work, he doesn’t worry. As long as there is complete understanding, of integration, of balance within you. 

Of course, the women are responsible, the grace of the family. She has to be gracious. It doesn’t look nice for a woman to behave like a man, because man need not be that gracious as the woman is. He’s after all a man. So, it’s all right, I mean, in his behavior he needs not be atrocious, but I mean sort of, sometimes if he swears sometimes, it doesn’t matter,  you see sometimes in a way, for a man. But for a woman it does because she is a gracious thing. But there are some things that men cannot do is you see like taking interest in women, you see. Some men are so horrid, you know. Horrible and absolutely, I can’t understand the way they take interest in women. What dresses women wear, sort of [thing/tangling]. All this rat-like behavior, it’s horrible. And this cannot be manly. That means they are such in, they are such slaves of women. They may call themselves something this and that. You know as I heard that this Mrs. Kennedy’s clothes, you see, her clothes were for sale, and people from Australia were falling, flying out to buy them. I mean, think of these men, what do you call them? I don’t know what you call them in English language, but they are just worse than earthworms. I don’t know from where they come. 

So man has to be a man. And man is a person like Rama. You have heard about his life how he was, you see, how he loved his wife, respected his own chastity. A man who cannot respect his chastity is not a man. He is absolutely an earthworm. So this what it is; a man has to have a character. He has to have that chivalry in him. He has to have that courage in him. He has to have that protective thing. If thieves come in the house the man tells the wife, “Oh, you go and open the door, and I am going to hide then,” and when the thieves go away, he says, “I am going to dominate.” That’s not the way. The man has to protect. The man has to look after. That’s why it doesn’t matter if he is little crude sometimes. It doesn’t matter, because he has to face. He’s, we can say he’s like a thorn and women are like the flowers. Now, in the thorn and flower you would like to be a flower, isn’t it? But in a man and woman you would like to be a thorn. So it’s wrong. He has to protect. He has to look after the invasions on the family life and other things. On the contrary, they are the ones who, who allow infiltrations by wrong people in the family. It’s the men. They bring in horrible women, they bring in horrible people, through their domination. “Oh, she is my friend. How can you object?” But what sort of a friend is she? He has to say, “No, I don’t like these people to come in the house. They are not like that. They have to get out.” It is he who has to say. And the woman has to understand. But if he says just out of domination it is nonsense. 

So everything has two sides as equal, you can see clearly. If it is done in love it’s perfect, but if it is done in domination it’s nonsensical. Why dominate? I mean, I don’t understand the word, domination. When there are two wheels, do they dominate each other? Can they? If one dominates, say one becomes bigger than the other, it will go round and round, won’t it? There’s no question of domination in this, but is question of integration and understanding and complete cooperation within themselves, which must permeate into the society, into the family. The marriages which are not helpful to the society are of no use. They are just a waste, just a waste. You see, we have so many marriages like this. People get married, live well, happily among themselves and finish off. These are the marriages which are going to change the society with their joy, happiness, make a home where everybody is expected, look after them, do for others. 

You see, there are many people who think that, “Nobody is doing anything for us.” What have you done for others? What have you done? Have you done anything for them? This once you start deciding and understanding it would be very good. Normally, a woman has a, when normally a woman is, if not brought up properly can be very, very conceited and can be very selfish and self-centered. Men can be also but women can be because, I mean, if they are brought up, if they are not brought up properly I’m saying that they may not like to spend their money on others, they would not like others to come in the house, and share this and that. But again we have to judge it. Is it done in love, or not?  Like the husband, you see, brings his friends and they may not like their friends coming in because it means money, you see. They, they would like to have more ornaments to themselves than to have some friends, for their friends. Can be, they can be like that. Some men could be like that also.  But, the both the things are wrong. This should be shared, to be understood. And the whole thing is that you must lavish your love on others. Need not spend money for that; need not. You can just be kind to them, nice to them, and little money, too. You see, there’s no harm in spending little money for others and expressing your love. You see, we are still very meticulous in our Sahaja Yoga as far as money is concerned. As far as love is concerned, we are very, very cautious. We have so much of fear within us, you see. 

Now, domination should never come in Sahaja Yoga at all. Say, for example, when I am telling you anything, an outsider might think that I am dominating you, because really I am touching very sore points within you, if you see it clearly. It is that, putting the left side too much you are all feeling guilty. That’s not good. Come along. So the, this is also an escape, you see, that you start feeling guilty and then you just don’t cure yourself. Just don’t feel guilty about anything. You see, I am just telling you this because I have to tell you. Now, one can feel that this is domination, if they do not see the love behind it, the beauty behind it, the compassion behind it. So never to feel that anybody dominates you, it’s the best way. You see, how can you be dominated? You are the Spirit. Your ego can be hurt. You are the Spirit. It cannot be dominated. But are you the Spirit? Are you feeling your Spirit? If you are feeling your Spirit you can never be dominated. None can dominate you. But if you feel that way all the time, that you are dominated, you are dominated. You’ll become a very, very nervous person. You can be a horrible person. You cannot face people. 

So it is time that you realize you are a Spirit and your husband is also a Spirit. Or if you are the husband you must know the wife is also the Spirit. And a mutual respect must grow in that level because both of you are saints. You are Sahaja yogis.  You must respect each other because you are Sahaja yogis. Everybody respects you because you are Sahaja yogis, who have not achieved realization but they are realized souls. Just think, when you were not realized if somebody had told you that he is a realized soul, how you would have felt about that person? You are not conscious of that but you should be conscious. By that you should not become vain but you must respect other souls who are realized. They are realized souls. They are the children of your Mother. When talking to each other you have to understand that; more so when you are husband and wife. 

The whole understanding that you had so far of, of husband and wife must be given up. It is, I think it’s a contract, sort of a marriage. In the marriage, you see, you see how much he dominates, what are his powers, what are my powers, how much money I get, how much he gets, where is the money kept, what’s all that. You see, it will only happen when you do not trust each other. But go on trusting more and more. There should be a competition in loving. There should be competition in, in trusting, in being honest, in being kind, in being in service. Let there be a competition like that, and then you’ll achieve results. The competition should be on the other side, instead of dominating, instead of being afraid, instead of sharing all nonsense. This is another thing which I must point out, which happens to married couple and which is very, very wrong also, that they both of them take up a role of very miserable people, the “Les Miserables”, you see. They sit down crying, every, oh, oh, oh, for nothing at all. You see, the whole world is collapsing before them. 

Now there are some great poets like Lord Byron maybe, or some more horrible people who have written horrible poems like that. And then they will recite those poems, so the sweetest songs are those and all sorts of a nonsense. Not for Sahaja yogis. You are not to indulge into this kind of a nonsense of sitting down and indulging into this kind of a nonsense and enjoying the miseries of each other. For the present, you have no miseries. Whatever has been there, is past and finished. Now, you are new people, with new awareness, with new things. You have no miseries. So forget all those things and try to enjoy each other’s company. And if you start doing that, sitting down and enjoying the miseries, you get out of it immediately and say, “Oh, we are getting into the same play of Lord Byron.” I don’t want to create Lord Byrons out of Sahaja yogis anymore. So please remember that don’t sit down and discuss and analyze your miseries. You have no miseries of any kind. You are the Spirit, you are the source of joy for yourself and for others and you have no business to sit down and cry and weep. And, “I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know.” Why you don’t know? You don’t know your Spirit? Don’t you know your Spirit? You know. Then why don’t you know? You have your vibratory awareness, and still how is it you are saying you don’t know? You have to know everything. And it has to be a very positive act to be happy, to be fragrant with joy and to give joy to others. That has to be with you. Otherwise, everything has no meaning. You see, I try My level best to make every marriage a very pompous thing, a very beautiful thing. But ultimately what I find, two crumpled-up people sitting down there, you know, sulking. And then imagine the children who are going to be born. They will think, “What? These sulking parents! Oh, God, save us from these crying babies.” So don’t put My all [attention into a] complete shattering state by this kind of attitude. 

Now if you have any questions, ask because I don’t know how far to say.
