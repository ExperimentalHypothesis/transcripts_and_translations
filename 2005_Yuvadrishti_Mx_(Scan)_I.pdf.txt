 40 नाभी चक्र Shakhambari 9. Devi HIMALAYAS 11 A SAHAJA INSIGHT The Sefer ha-Zohar 14 मेरे प्यारे बच्चों.... 18 Rembrandt 20 Encounter With Love

 I have met Her Holiness SHRI MATAJI NIRMALA DEVI Her nature is kind and gentle. She is a mother. She is above us, yet always with us. She often gives advice and counselling, but at other times just listens. She knows a person's problem enen before they speak. She always understands a man or woman's dilemma better than they do. Her way is gentle, for She can as casily show us the answer by means of a story or an action or a smile, as another person can through words of harshness. When She speaks, people listen. They do not interrupt or argue. They do not second guess Her motives or interpret Her words for their own ends. The wise know that Her words are better than their own. They call Her "Shri Mataji" or "Mother." They listen with all their being. They try to bring each of Her qualities one at a time into their own lives. Sbri Mataji says She knouws nothing but when She shops She always gets the best price. When She saves, the money is always there when needed. She rarely buys things for Herself. To Het, the spending of money is like the sowing of seeds. With time and love, they sprout into things greater than coins and bills. It is like magic. about money or banks, She says She knews nothing of tars. She cannot drive. She says that signal lights and traffic control are the jobs of men. But She is the greatest of travellers None can keep up with Her. It is as if She sits and everything else moves around Her. She moves in this way throughout the world and for those whose eyes fall upon Her, a blessing unfolds in their hearts. com Shri Mataji can judge men and women finely. She knows them each because they are all Her children 1

 and a mother knows her children because they are born from her being. She can see into them. She can still their minds. Her hand rests upon their souls, She hears the whispering of their thoughts. Shri Mataji never gossips or speakr ill of others. She sees the best in us all, so that we each can see the best in ourselves. She remembers our talents, our children, our tastes, She calls upon us, when we need direction. Her direction is the greatest of blessings. Fen are the rules that She gives. She trusts us each to guide ourself. She wants us to grow and love each other. We try each day to be our best for Her. Shri Mataji knows literature. She told us about William Shakespeare and Somerset Maugham. She introduced us to Tagore and Kabir. She understands the subtleties of the Russian spirit in the words of Leo Tolstoy. She reads books, but best of all She read our hearts. Shri Mataji says She is only a mother. She says She is only a grandmother and a wife. Yet She knows about architecture and music and fine art and politics and biology and astronomy. She knows about engineering and history and economics and all the natural and man-made sciences. She has knowledge about realms for which the men and women of this world have not yet even defined names to describe. She knows these arts like no other. And of each discipline, She speaks freely, without a hint of bragging or showing off Her knowledge. She speaks as a teacher or a sage whose knowledge flows like water to merely quench a thirst and not to drown. Shri Mataji is compassion. She is love and honour. She is dignity and bravery. She is knowledge and dharma and confidence and strength. We do not need dictionaries for these words. We can look to Her and can see. We see Her sit for hours greeting a queue of people, strangers and seekers of truth, each troubled in small She lifts the weight from their shoulders. We see Her sit through the night, listening to the music of amateurs. She praises talent. She helps us to appreciate each other. ways. She takes time where everyone else is too busy. When She takes rest, She continues to work. When She takes food, She feeds Her children. We saw Her in all the great cities of the world. We saw Her at the United Nations, at the Royal Albert Hall. She took us to the Ganapatipule. She sent us to the Ulluru. In the smallest village without even a roadway, She travelled on a cart pulled by an oxen. 2

 On a jumbo jet or an underground commuter train, She journeyed with us. We greeted Her at airports. She came to our homes. She asks nothing of us that we are not able to give. She never gives up on us, despite our mistakes. Shri Mataji speaks well and at length. Her lectures and talks cover all range of topics. She tells us about our spirit, our ascent and our duty, but She also tells us about our marriages and our children, our hygiene and health. She guides us with the steady motion of a shepherd and the gentle hand of a mother. She makes us laugh when we forget the joy. Her words flow. They are studied and remembered and imbibed by each of us to the best of our ability. We try to understand the knowledge that is before us. Many things we forget, but still we are drawn closer to Her. For some, there is no understanding in Shri Mataji's words. The language She speaks is not their own. But nonetheless, they know what She is saying. They do not know the words, but they know the meaning. Her voice comes from thcir own heart. For others, the words that are songs of praise are unknown to them. They are hard to follow The quickness of the music leaps ahead and the words remain unlearnt and foreign. But somehow, the music rises from a distant time and is as familiar as this morning's sunrise. When they sing of Shri Mataji, the beat is their breath and lyrics their blood. And for others still, Shri Mataji has never been within sight of their eyes. They have never seen Her, but yet they can recognize. They can remember. Without meeting, they know Her as She knows them. From Benin and Belarus, from Aruba and Alberta and Reunion, there is an understanding. On the shores of Ganapatipule and in the hills of Cabella, there is recognition beyond nations and races and people. Our body is one in that knowledge. And non, for each of us, in our bearts, we hold special a memory of our time with Her. One recalls how his Mother greeted him at an airport, remembering his name. Another retains the comforting guidance She gave in a troubled time. Another still, reflects on the way She held a tea cup or smiled with widened eyes at the faces of our children. We remember each of the flowers we gave to Her. Our deepest desire was to give all of our selves.

 We wanted to surrender, but held out only a flower. Accidents and mischief and calamities never happen to Shri Mataji. Around Her there often appears to be chaos and confusion. But with Her, there is a calmness, a stillness that comes from knowing Her mere breath gives order. Her name is Placidity. Trouble is barred from Her presence. And then, at othber times, we bave another glimpse of Shri Mataji. In Her photographs we occasionally see beyond. A dancing vibration, a haloed glow, a bouquet of streaming lights speak to us of something more. At first we turn away in disbelief, unable to understand, skeptical. Then these images, windows created by our own cameras, open wide for us, displaying the universe. With recognition, our hearts are filled. She is the composer and the choreographer, the lyricist and the conductor. She fashions the instruments and the music. She creates the musicians. Each of us anait the cue of Her haton. Her music is beauty and we know not always, but when we reflect upon it, we know that the music is not ouurs. As much as we practise, we know it is Her breath in our flutes, Her hand guiding ours upon the bow. The strings, the bridge, the fingerboard are all illusion. She is the only reality. Sometimes we forget, but when we remember, we try again to be only with Her in tune. Shri Mataji's way is noble. She is a mother. She is very much above us. She is always and forever with us.

 होती है। जिस तरह सोने की चमक कभी कम नही होती उसी तरह धर्म को कभी बदला नही जा सकता। घार्मिक आचार की कोई तुलनात्मक स्थिति नहीं होती। कोई भी कार्य मूलभूत दृष्टि से या तो गलत या फिर सही होता है। घर्म उत्क्रांति का मुप्त नियम है, जिससे मनुष्य की उत्क्रांति अमीबा से इस रूप तक हुई है। यही नियम हमारे आध्यात्मिक उन्नति को सुरक्षित तथा पोषित करता है । उत्क्रांति में दिशानिर्देश के रूप में 'दस आदेश' सबसे अधिक शक्तिशाली घर्म- नियम का आवाहन हुआ। जिन्होने हमेशा इन मूलभूत सदाचार नियमों का पालन किया है उन्होने आत्मासाक्षात्कार के शक्ति को सही अर्थ में महसूस किया है जोलोग आत्मसाक्षात्कार के पहले इन आचारसंहिताओं का महत्व नही जानते थे वे बाद में स्वाभाविक ही जानने लगे । यहाँ तक कि आत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद अपने घार्मिक आचरण के प्रतिकार रूप में पेट क्षेत्र के भौतिक संकेत भी महसूस कर सकते हैं। कुछ लोग तो आश्चर्य में पड़ जाते है कि उनका पेट आध्यात्मिक कार्य के लिए संवेदनशील हो जाता है और प्रतिकार करता है। असल में ज्यादा समय हम अपनी आत्मा के सौंदर्य का आनंद लेते है इसलिए अधार्मिक चीजों के लिए हमारे पास समय ही नहीं रहता। जीवित रहने और विकास के लिए उत्क्रांति के नियमों का प्रादुर्भाव हमारे अन्दर होने लगता है। हमें हमेशा याद रखना है कि यह मार्गदर्शक बाते हमारे अनुशरण के लिए उदाहरण स्वरूप है। हम किसी काम के लिए बाध्य नही है । सहजयोग में हम खुद के गुरू बन जाते है। चैतन्य लैहरियाँ हमें अपनी स्थिति बयान करती है और उसी के अनुरूप निर्णय लेना चाहिए। आत्म साक्षात्कार का सीधा फायदा है कि हम अपनी कमजोरियाँ देखना बंद करके साक्षी स्वरूप में हम अपने सत्य स्वरूप को देखते है । एक तरीके से हम ही अपना अंतिम फैसला लेते हैं। परंपरा: नाभी चक्र के अधिष्टित देवता है श्री विष्णु जो सारे संसार के सरंक्षक है । श्री विष्णु ही है जो हमारे धर्म के आधारभूत है और जो हमे हमारे उत्थान की ओर ले जाते है। नाभी चक्र की शक्ति का स्थान गृहलक्ष्मी का है जो पत्नी स्थान यानि की गृह देवी का स्थान है । पत्नी का आदर होना चाहिए तथा उसे भी आदर की मर्ति होनी चाहिए । श्री लक्ष्मी हम मे शांति का सरोत है जो हमे हमारे आध्यात्मिक उन्नति और ध्यान के माध्यम से प्राप्त होती है। स्थूल भीतिक आयाम: नाभी चक्र पेट का कार्य संचालन करता है। अगर पेट का कार्य सुचारू रूप से नही हुआ तो हमारे भोजन का पाचन, आत्मसात विधी प्रभावित होगी । इसलिए पेट बहुत महत्वपूर्ण अंग है । हमारे खाने के प्रति रवैया तथा किस प्रकार अन्न ग्रहण करते है इससे हमारे पाचक रसों तथा ग्रंथियों पर असर होता है अगर खाना जल्दबाजी में, गुस्से से या चिंता ग्रास होकर खाये तो उसका पाचन ठिक से नही होता है, क्योंकि हमारे पेट के मॉसपेशी उस वक्त तनाव में कार्य करते हैं और अपना कार्य सुचारू रूप से नहीं कर पाते। हमे संतुलित भोजन लेना चाहिए जिससे खाना पेट में आसानी से आगे बढे और पाचक रसों से सुचारू रूप से पचाया जा सके योग्य पोषण के लिए शॉंतिपूर्ण रूप से भोजन करना बहुत आवश्यक है, यह एक ध्यान क्रिया है। नाभी चक्र यकृत के कार्य संचालन के लिए भी जिम्मेदार होता है जो हमारे ध्यान के लिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है चित्त को ज्यादा तनावपूर्ण स्थिती में नहीं रखना चाहिये । इसलिए यकृत की तरफ विशेष रूप से ध्यान देना चाहिए। (ज्योकि अयोग्य भोजन से या उत्लेजकों के कारण अतितापित होने को संवेदनशील होता है) इसलिए हमें इस तरह का व्यवहार करना चाहिये की हमारा चित्त बहुत ज्यादा सोचने तथा योजनाओं की वजह से अति कार्यशीलता का शिकार न बने । नाभी चक्र की दशा: नाभी चक्र कई वजह से कमजोर पड़ सकता है । हमारा बायां नाभी चक्र घरेलू समस्या वश या अंति पैसे की चिंता के कारण खराब हो सकता है। आत्म साक्षात्कार के बाद हम ईश्वरी शक्ति पर भरोसा करना सिखते है । देवी शक्ति सदैव हमारा संरक्षण करती है। हम सभी प्रकार की जिम्मेदारियों को संभालने में सक्षम बन जाते है और हम अपने कर्तव्य बड़े आनंदपूर्ण ढंग से निभाते हैं । तब हम यह जान जाते है कि परिवार जो समाज का अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण घटक है संभाला जाना चाहिए और प्यार, एकता तथा आदरपूर्ण वातावरण में ही पोषित होना चाहिए। भोजन के बारे में अधिक सोचना, लालचवश अधिक खाना या अधिक उपवास रखना दोनो ही नाभी चक्र पर बुरा प्रभाव करते है। यह पेट को उत्तेजित रखता है ज़िससे कि उर्जा बहाव बाधित होती है। अविवेकिय उपवास से भी इस चक्र को हानि पहुचती है । हम उपवास के माध्यम से कभी भी आत्मा को नहीं प्राप्त कर सकते । किसी भी डॉक्टर को पूछिये, हमारे पेट के लिये नियमित तथा प्रमाणित आहार आवश्यक है । उपवास से हमारा चित्त खाने के तरफ ज्यादा भागता है। जब शरीर में भोजन की आवश्यकता होती है तो वह संकेत भेजता है । हमें किसी चक या उसके नियम के विरोध में काम नही करना चाहिए । मद्यपान करना तथा अयोग्य आहार नाभी चक्र के लिये उपयुक्त नही है। आत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद भोजन के प्रति हमारा रवैया बदल जाता है। हम किसी अतिविशेष भोजन के विषय में न सोचते हुए अच्छे भोजन का आनंद लेते है जो हमें चैतन्य प्रदान करे। हम भोजन के प्रति सूक्ष्म तथा अलिप्त रवैया विकसित करने लगते है और संतोष जो हमें किसी विशिष्ट पकवान से मिलता है वह हम साधारण आहार से प्राप्त करने लगते है। नाभी चक्र का शुद्धीकरण मध्य नाभी : पंचतत्वों का उपयोग: मोमबत्ती क्रिया पेट के क्षेत्र में मोमबत्ती घुमाना बहुत प्रभावशाली होता है। नमक-पानी क्रिया - अपने दोनों पैर नमकयुक्त गुनगुने पानी में रखके ध्यान करने से चक्र को बहुत फायदा पहुंचता है (सभी नीचे के चक्रों के लिए भी) थोड़ी देर धीरे-धीरे शांतिपूर्ण ढंग से लंबी श्वास लेकर इसी तरह वापस बाहर छोड़िये । प्रार्थनाः श्रीमाताजी मैं अपनी आत्मा में पूरी तरह संतुष्ट हूँ । न ত 1 2

 SWEET NIRVICHARITA When I was small and full of glee A little thought once came to me. "Hello. I'm who you are," it said And quickly it filled up my head. From this time on, my once cool brain Got loud and hot under the strain Of the ego that waged war, Leaving my soul broken and poor. I grew up lost inside this web Of words and vanity instead Of the freedom I once knew, When I was young and fresh and new. सामान्य उपदेश : 9) 3) 3) बायांनाभी: पंचतत्वों का उपयोग: मोमबत्ती क्रिया। नाभी चक्र के अगले तथा पिछले भाग को चैतन्य दे Decades passed without respite From the noise that dulled my life.

It started with an 'Ah', then 'Ommm' And rose into a sonic boom. प्रार्थना: श्रीमाताजी कृपा करके मुझे उदार बनाईये । And suddenly I was aware Of a baby's loving stare. सामान्य उपदेश : नाभी को चैतन्य दे । २) जीवन के सभी परिस्थितीयों में अपने आपको समाधानी सखने की आदत डालें । ३) बहुत ज्यादा शिकायत करना टालें । ४) नमक का सेवन करें (विशिष्टतः बायें तरफ के बाधाओं के लिए) ५) उदारता तथा मंगलता के गुण को विकसित करें और कजूसीपन को त्यागे । Its radiance filled up my mind With something sweet from beyond time.

I rose to heights of silent Love Where Joy rains down from high above, And saw the Sun, not as a star, But as a glorious Avatar. दाया नाभी: पंचतत्वों का उपयोग : नमक-पानी क्रिया के लिए ठंडे नमकीन पानी का इस्तेमाल करें । Oh, how my heart did dance and sing In that sweet, eternal spring! I thanked the Mother and Her Son For all the wonderful things they'd done. सामान्य उपदेशः १) चर्बीयुक्त पदार्थों का तथा दुध से बने पदार्थों का सेवन कम करें। २) ऐसे चीजों का आहार में समावेश करे जो यकृत को ठंडक पहुचायें जैसे की गन्ना, अद्रक, सफेद चावल, छांछ और ताज़े फल तथा सब्जियाँ । (See liver diet) ३) गुस्से पर काबू पाने का प्रयत्न करें । यकृत पर बर्फ रखें (ध्यान के समय भी जब चित्त एकाग्र ना हो पाये और निर्विचार स्थिति ना आये) Waking up, I smiled to sce A sunbeam on my Christmas tree, The darkness of my life had passed And here I was at home, at last. -Edward

 Shakhambari Devi This year on 14 January we worshipped Shri Mataji on Makar Sankranti Puja as Shakhambari Devi. Shakhambari Devi is the goddess of fertility of Mother Earth. When we worship Shakhambari Devi we worship vegetables and fruits which grow by the blessings of Mother Earth in the process of creation in the plant kingdom, and the same is offered to the Goddesses. There is a Shakhambari Devi Temple in Uttaranchal (a state in north eastern part of India) and she is worshipped with Festive colours Legend has it that this goddess helped the living creatures to survive only upon plants and vegetables, when no water was available on earth, for as long as hundred years. Thus, she came to be known as ShakhambariDevi, that is the goddess who feed us upon vegetables. I usu Stating in botanical terms, there exists a form of energy behind the growth of plants and vegetables; the evolution of this energy is caused due to the multiplication and compounding of atoms. The same energy has been worshipped as goddess Shakhambari in the legends. The Shakhambari Devi www. The temple of Shakhambari Devi is situated at a distance of 40 kms. from Saharanpur (Uttaranchal, India) in the Shivalik mountain range. Shakhambari Devi is one of the famous Shakti Peeth. The head of Sati had fallen here. On the right hand side of main idol of goddess, is idol of Bhima and Bhramari and on the left is the idol of Shitakshi goddess. Shitakshi is also known as Shitala Devi. During NavRatra and Durga-Ashtami the temple hosts large fairs. city The History of Shakhambari Devi Long time ago, there was a great spiritual master named 'Durgam'. He mastered all the vedas by of Lord Brahma and received a boon from him that he will not be defeated in a battle even the grace against the gods. After receiving such a boon, he went on rampage all around the earth and stole the four vedas. He defeated Lord Indra in a battle. Subsequently there was no rain on earth for a century as Lord Indra, the rain-god, was imprisoned by Durgam. The living beings starved for water. In the absence of vedas the Brahmans could not perform religious rites.

 Sensing the disastrous consequences of Durgam's rule, the gods took refuge with Maha Devi', the great goddess. They prayed to her, "Oh Mother, the way you killed 'Shumb and Nishumb' and brought an end to the miseries of mankind, in the same way, kindly kill Durgam." On seeing her people in distress, the eyes of goddess were full of tears. She looked at the gods and saints through hundred eyes. The water gushed out of her eyes and thousands of streams overflowed with water. The forests became again green and lands fit for tilling. Oceans, rivers and ponds were again full of water and the gods were again happy. The miseries of people disappeared. As the goddess of hundred eyes looked at her subjects with the eyes of pity, so the gods named her 'Shatakshi' and worshipped her. When whole world was dry for want of rain, then goddess 'Shatakshi' created vegetation out of her body and saved world from starvation. For this act of goddess she is also famous as "Shakhambari Devi. After restoring order on earth, the goddess asked gods, "How can I help you further?" The gods prayed to her and asked, "Please return us the four vedas, which were stolen by Durgam". Then goddess fought a fierce battle with Durgam and killed him and restored Vedas. The goddess was also called Durga for killing the demon Durgam. In- fact the three different names Shatakshi, Shakhambari and Durga are names of the same goddess. News & Activities गणतंत्र दिवस के शुभ अवसर पर गाजियाबाद युवा शक्ति ने एक सांस्कृतिक कार्यक्रम का आयोजन किया। श्रीमाताजी की अनुपम कृपा से कार्यक्रम काफी रंगारंग व संगीतमय रहा। झंडारोहण से शुरु हुए इस कार्यक्रम का समापन जोगवा गाकर हुआ और सभी ने माँ के चैतन्य वर्षा का भरपुर आनंद लिया। N 1022

 HIMAL AVAS A SAHAJA INSIGHT Continued from December 2004 The Himalaya has immensely influenced the life in the Indian subcontinent in more than one way since the ancient times. Its mid continental position acts as a barrier between the northern cold front and the southern subtropical warm belt, and prevents the monsoons from crossing over its heights into Tibet. This formidable attribute of the Himalaya forces the winds to lose their moisture in its fold which subsequently becomes a source of water to a multitude of rivers held sacred by devotees since the dawn of human civilization. As the legend goes, king Bhagiratha intensely prayed to Shri Ganga to appear on Earth. Impressed by his prayers She agreed to appear from the cosmic world, but the Earth could not bear Her fierce flow upon which Bhagiratha prayed to Shiva to seek His blessings. Pleased by his prayer Shiva held the weight of Shri Ganga in His matted hair, but she got entangled and thus could not reach the Mother Earth. On this, Bhagirath once again prayed and Shiva was pleased to liberate Shri Ganga from His matted hair, after which Shri Ganga branched out on the Earth in ten different directions. The various branches finally converged at Devaprayag to form Shri Ganga for Her joy-giving journey to the Bay of Bengal. Shri Ganga with the highest BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) value among all the rivers is called as the life-line of India in general and northern plains in particular. Shri Ganga symbolizes the 'shudha ichha' aspect at the subtle level on which various pilgrimage centres are located at the gross level on ground. Enlightenment on Himalayas by Shri Mataji not only provides strength to the contemporary scientific thought on the evolution of the Himalaya, but also gives a deeper meaning to the spiritual realm for the seekers. In Sahaja parlance, Himalaya corresponds to the Sahasrara Chakra. Shri Mataji once revealed "The Himalayas are the Sahasrara that Mother Earth has created for you. This Sahasrara is to be worshipped. This Sahasrara is very great. I don't know if you can see vibrations emitting from it. I am completely engulfed by their vibrations that I cannot see anything else. There are only vibrations and vibrations, nothing else. Those who are residing here are swimming in vibrations and seem like fish swimming in the ocean of vibrations. You cannot distinguish one from the other.I cannot describe in words the splendour of the beautiful vibrations that are spread here. This is indeed the blessing of the Himalayas. Foremost we recognize the ocean as our Guru. The ocean is our Father. When the ocean leaves behind all the dirt of the World that is dumped into it and rises in the sky as clouds, then it becomes completely pure and beautiful. Floating in this state it reaches the feet of the Himalayas and spreads as 'Him. The word 'dhaula' means 'completely pure', nirmal. Dhar means 'range." (The mountain range is called Dhauladhar.) Like these pure ranges in the Himalayas, they are also to be found in our brain, where they support an opening of the Sahasrara. After this I cannot describe any further but I can say this, that the auspicious opportunity has come today of this connection; try to avail it and go to its depth. Think that before it, we are a dot of sand, an innocent child, There is G 11

 ction from Himalaya's Peak. From it we received the streams of Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati. All these nothing so special in us that we can stand before its majesty. What are we? It is so awesome! The Himalayas are the Sahasrara of the whole streams flow within us, nirmal, despite all the Universe. They have given the whole Universe so negativity we throw in them. Despite the way we much comfort and joy after which there is nothing more disrespect them. Yet, Himalaya unhesitatingly flows to be attained. With the help of this Sahasrara, I have His purity in them. But all such things will soon end, opened your Sahasraras. With the help of this they cannot go on forever. (Devi Puja ,Talnoo, Sahasrara, I have realized that till the peace of the Dharmshala,March 26th, 1985) Himalayas settles in you, till its greatness penetrates Man has veritably witnessed the rise of the your behaviour, it is useless to open your Sahasrara. Himalaya when evolving from ape stage to the Otherwise your Sahasrara vill burn like a furnace. present form. Evolution of both Himalaya and When I see a furnace burning inside some people I man has been coincidental in terms of time and is wonder O God! Why did I open his Sahasrara? There is very significant from the point of viewof so much smoke and negativity coming out that it is spirituality. There is an intimate connection better that his Sahasrara closes. Like the opening of between the Mother Earth and the origin of Himalayas as Shri Mataji reveals "Thousanmds and thousands, millions of years back, the Mother Earth started producing Her Ganesha. It was first a huge ocean where Himalaya stands. Himalaya gradually Pandora's Box, one does not know what all is coming out. It is shocking to see snakes, scorpions and all the possible negativity being thrown out of it. Today we worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are here, and pray to them started coming out of that ocean, in flat way, like a to bless us with Devi Shakti. We have received the Shiva-Lingam, which is the expression as the blessings of the Devi Shakti from a Mother. That is manifestation of the animals; they have the brains why, in the form of Mother, let us come to the feet which are flat. But when the Himalayas started (Sharanagat) of the Himalayas. coming out of the sea, the Mother Earth was pushed on the sides. And the We have gotten our Mother Earth started prote NG 12

 giving folds to her saree, you can say. Now, when that moment started, the saree gave waves of vibrations in such a way that at certain points it rose up to a point becoming like Shri Ganesha. And it was, to begin with, of flat, again the same type. But then, still more folds started coming up, much later, when human brain started developing its ego. So the whole of that land was pushed tép and another land joined it in such a manner that it formed an apex. The super- ego was pushed in and was brought to the climax. That synchronizes with the human brain, because the whole universe is represented in our body as well. Now, the central axis of the Mother Earth acted as the spinal cord. By this happening in the Himalayas, again there was a big push on to all the mountains which were to be created as Shri Ganesha and they got into their final forms. And the apex was created. So, the Mother Earth as Gauri created all these Ganeshas. At the other end of these ranges, must be the highest mountain because it is pushed the most. Mount Blane should be higher than this. You see, when they pushed on the right hand side more the ego went expressing in Mount Blanc, you see for example. And on the other side, it was created another Ganesha at other end near Darjeeling. So Shri Ganesha was expressed even in Darjeeling, you get the same kind of redness on that. I have seen another Shri Ganesha created in Delphi where they say is the Nabhi of the Mother Earth. and Also when Shri Shiva Lingam is created, along with Himalayas there is a Shri Ganesha created, as in Amarnath, where a drop of water falls on a particular area and creates the lingam. Plus that, another drop falls on another side and creates Shri Ganesha exactly like the face. Now the ocean is the father, and the Mother Earth is your Mother. But when the Mother Earth becomes a Mountain, She is called as the Father. The reason is: She at that height can catch the Father on Top of Her head, as snow or as rain. That is how a mother becomes the father, and so She can perform the complete function of a father and a Mother. In that state only, Gauri the Daughter of the Mountains comceived Shri Ganesha without the help of the Father, immaculate. The purity of snow is hundred percent, and that covers the Mother Earth, gives the formation of innocence. All the filth and dirt goes into the ocean is clearified by the sun, which is also Shri Ganesha, and is brought on the top of the hills and mountains to cover it". (From souvenir released on the eve of Shri Ganesh Puja, Lucknow, 1999) To praise the divinity of himalayas is beyond words. Abode of Gods, the Himalaya has been frequented by sages and saints, philosophers and philanthropists, ascetics and mystics, travelers and tourists, pilgrims and pastors since the immemorial past. And now, for the realized souls - the Sahaja Yogis, the Himalaya is held in high esteem for its significant correspondence with the Sahasrara of the world. Shiva, who embodies the destroyer aspect of the trinity of God (Generation, Organization, Destruction) is said to reside at Mt Kailash. According to tradition Shiva wears bones of the dead as decoration and smears himself in ash - signifying the burning of the lower desires. The higher significance of the destroyer aspect is that he cuts the bonds of the ego, liberating the Atma within from the darkness of ignorance. Coincident with this theme of death is the presence of two large hollows on Mt Kailash so that from one particular angle, the ice covered dome of Kailash appears as a skull with two large eyeholes peering out from beneath the skull-like dome.

 The The mystical tradition in Judaism is known as Kabbala and its major text is the Sefer ha-Zohar, parts of which began to circulate in manuscript in the northern part of the Iberian peninsula of western Europe (now known as Spain) in the late 1280s. The Zohar presents itself as an ancient rabbinic midrash (or priestly ) on the Pentateuch (a collection of ancient Jewish texts), authored by Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai (known as Rashbi), a rabbi' of the second century CE, who, along with his circle of mystics, is the main protagonist of the Zohar. Written in Aramaic, the language of these early Jewish mystics, the Zohar has many characteristic words and phrases that betray its medieval European origin (having in fact been written by Rabbi Moses de Leon). Thus the Zohar is most likely the collective product of a Kabbalistic fraternity in Gerona in Castile, in northern Spain, drawing on previous, secret, teachings of the earlier Rabbi Isaac the Blind (c.1160-c.1236) and his circle in now southern France). Many of the concepts presented in the Zohar are also to be found in earlier texts. The term Sefirot, for instance, originated in the Sefer Yetzira, where it is refered to as ten ideal numbers that functioned, along with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, as the 'building blocks' of the universe. The concept of the ten Sefirot appeared in other Sefer ha-Zohar Com m entary Provence earlier texts, notably Rabbi Azriel of Gerona's Explanation of the Ten Sefirot. There is an apparent similarity that the diagramatic representation of the ten Sefirot has with the diagramatic representation of the chakras in the yogic tradition of India. It has become fashionable in certain parts of new age spirituality to make such a comparison, and, as a Google search reveals, there are a number of web pages that purport to directly compare Sefirot to chakras. Leaving aside the obvious, namely that there are ten Sefirot and, usually, only seven chakras. There are obvious dangers in such a superficial comparison of two profound mystical traditions, and the direct comparison of Sefirot to chakras is not attempted here. These two mystical traditions do however have some similarities worthy of note. One fruitful comparison is that of the Shechina with the Kundalini, both of whom are refered to as feminine, and both of whom grant or deny access to the aspirant to higher spiritual knowledge. The Gate In the Zohar 1:103b, it is written: Come and see. There is opening within opening, rung upon rung, through which the glory of the blessed Holy One becomes known. Opening of the tent [Genesis 18:1] is the opening of Righteousness, as it is said: Open for me gates of righteousness. [Psalm 118:19] Rabbi: Chief Religious official of a Synagogue who performs ritualistic, educational and other functions. 14

 This is the first opening to enter; Through this opening all other supernal openings come into view. Whoever attains this attains all other openings, for all abide in Her [the Shechina] In this text, the phrase 'the gates of righteousness' Keter is understood to refer to the Shechina. For a yogi, the Kundalini also resides at the first opening, as described in a song in the Marathi language, attributed to Namdev, and dating most probably from the late thirteenth century CE, coincidentally the date of the Zohar: in the beginning is the ant Hokhmah Binah mouth of the triple river is the mouth of the ant Hesed Din in darkness is the ant Tiferet in flames a wick of water lights a lamp of soot in the wake of the ant all of the sky follows the world of our making's her dropping Nezah Hod I pursue that ant I, Vishnudas nama unlock the ant with my guru Here the 'ant' is yogic code for the Kundalini, and the 'mouth of the triple river' refers to the entrance to the three nadis, or channels, which Yesod connect the chakras. The thirteenth century Marathi saint Jnaneshwara has provided the clearest exposition of Kundalini awakening in the sixth chapter of his commentary on the Bhagavadgita, popularly known as the Jnaneshwari. In the midst of a technical, but nevertheless awesome, description of the ascent of the Kundalini, he comments that Shekhinah This Kundalini is the mother of the world, 15

 RIRANI who illumines the self and gives shade to the sprouted seed of the universe. It is the embodiment of the formless Brahman, the cask of Lord Shiva, the main spring of the sacred syllable Om. In this we are reminded of the Zoharic relationship of the Shechina to the male aspect of the Divine. Gates and palaces Let us consider another text from the Zohar, from 1:7b: Open for me gates of righteousness [Psalm 118:19], this is the gate of the Lord [ibid]. This is certain because if one does not enter through this gate, m one cannot gain entry to the worlds. It is like an exalted King who is high, hidden and concealed, and who has made gates for himself, one upon the other and at the end of all the gates he had made one particular gate with a number of locks, a number of doors, and a number of palaces. In some respects this reminds the present writer of the Spanish Christian mystic, Teresa of Avila (1515- 1582), who, in her book, The Interior Castle, depicts the soul entering a castle and proceeding through the seven heavenly mansions containing numerous rooms so as to encounter God at its centre. In First Mansions, chapter one, Teresa outlines for the reader (originally her fellow nuns) her first thoughts: I began to think of the soul as if it were a castle made of a single Diamond or of very clear crystal, in which there are many rooms, just as in Heaven there are many mansions. In her conclusion, Teresa notes that Although I have spoken here only of seven Mansions, yet in each there are comprised many more, both above and below and around, with lovely gardens and fountains and things so delectable that you will want to lose yourselves in praise of the great God Who created it in His image and likeness. Also in her conclusion, Teresa cautions the reader against over-confidence: It is true that, however strong you may think yourselves, you cannot Enter all the Mansions by your own efforts: the Lord of the Castle Himself must admit you to them. So, if you meet with any resistance, I advise you not to make any effort to get in, for if you do you will displease Him so much that He will never admit you. As in the Zoharic text quoted earlier, here we have an 'exalted King' (Lord of the Castle) who decides who will or will not enter his domain. WOH A probable reason for this similarity between Teresa's Interior Castle and the earlier Zohar lies in the 16 2

 Jewish ancestry of Teresa. Whilst Teresa attempted to keep her past secret, she had been brought up in a Jewish converso family whose ancestors had in earlier times felt it prudent to convert to Christianity. Additionally we need to note that both Teresa and her confidant, Juan de la Cruz, were living in Avila, the Spanish town where Moses de Leon had compiled the Zohar less than three hundred years earlier. Teresa's seven mansions can also be compared to the seven stages of meditation in Abraham Abulafia's ectastic Kabbalah, and to the seven palaces of the earlier Merkabah tradition. The origin of the Zoharic use of gates and palaces is most probably to be found in the texts of the earlier Jewish mystical tradition, the Merkabah. As a modern historian has noted, "the world of Merkabah mysticism is one of the most dazzling of the mystical worlds. It is a realm of fantastic heavenly beings, of bizarre magical names, and of occult interactions between spirit and matter. In it, closed gates to celestial palaces are opened by long, incomprehensible incantations, and the dangers which rise up against man as he enters the realm of the supernatural are met with seals of truth." The period of Merkabah mysticism extends from as early as the first century BCE and continues until the tenth century CE, and whilst its texts have only survived in fragments and are still being studied by historians, its influence is surely in the Zohar. In the Pirkei Heikhalot, which has only survived in a fragment which includes chapters 15 to 29, the mystic is given detailed instructions for passing through the gates of seven successive palaces, each of which are guarded by wrathful angels who can refuse entry if the mystic does not give the correct 'password'. Six reflected in the seventh The concept of seven as a sacred number is common throughout many religions and mythologies, and is also present in the Zohar and in earlier Jewish mystical texts such as those of the Merkabah tradition in which the mystic enters seven successive palaces as noted above. The notion of six being reflected in the seventh is encountered less so. In the texts of the Kabbala, such as the Zohar, the six male aspects (or sons), namely Hesed (greatness), Gevurah or Din (judgement), Tiferet (beauty), Hod (majesty), Nesah (endurance), and Yesod (foundation), are reflected in the seventh, the female Shechina (or daughter). Whilst the male/female aspect of the relationship of the six to the seventh would seem to be unique to the Kabbala, there are other mystical traditions where six powers are found integrated in the seventh. In Kundalini yoga, the qualities of the six main chakras, namely Mooladhara (innocence, wisdom), Swadisthana (creativity), Nabhi (sustenance, satisfaction), Anahat (love, joy), Vishuddhi (collective consciousness, communication), Agnya (forgiveness), are integrated in the seventh, the Sahasrara. Classical Kundalini yoga texts also described the ascent of the Kundalini through the six chakras to the seventh, the Sahasrara, known as the thousand-petalled lotus. Thus, in the ninth stanza of the Saundarya-Lahari (The Ocean of beauty) the great Indian yogi-saint, Sankara, addresses the Devi, the Goddess: Thou art diverting Thyself, in secrecy with Thy Lord, in the thousand- petalled lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in the Muladhara, Continued on page 19

 मेरे प्यारे बच्चों... श्रीमाताजी द्वारा सहजयोगीयों को लिखे गये पत्रो के कुछ अंश जो मराठी भाषा से हिन्दी मे अनुवादित किये गये है । सभी सहजयोगी भाई बहन हैं। आपस में पूर्ण तरह से प्रेम रखना चाहिए। किसी से ज्यादा, किसी से कम प्रेम करना यह गुटबाजी है । मुझे गुटबाजी बिल्कुल पसंद नही है । मैं इस चीज से तंग आ चुकी हूँ। सहजयोग के लिए यह बहुत ही धातक है । हम सब एक है और एक ही विराट के अनेक अंगप्रत्यंग हैं तो फिर किसी एक अंग पर निर्भर कैसे रह सकते है। यरम ॐ श्री मार्कडेय ऋषी ने ही आदिगुरू शंकराचार्यजी का अवतरण लिया था। सहजयोग तत्क्षण घटित होता है, लेकिन उसे श्रद्धा और समर्पण से ही बरकरार रखा जा सकता है, यह सत्य जिसने जाना वही सचा सहजयोगी है। सहजयोग के कारण जो अगम्य था वह गम्य हुआ है, जो सुक्ष्म था वह दृश्य हुआ है । पर सहजयोगी विशेषकर हिन्दुस्तान के, बहुत कम गहरे उतरे है। * लंदन मे सहजयोग का कार्य बहुत जोरो से शुरू है और धीरें-धीरे जमीन मे सहजयोग की जड़ें फैल रही है। पर जड़ों को ही कठीनाई होती है। अगर जमीन की मिट्टी बहुत ही नरम एवं गीली होगी तो जड़ें धरती में आसानी से प्रवेश करेंगी, मगर ऐसी जड़ें कमजोर होती है और उनकी जमीन पर पकड़ मजबूत नही होती, तथा वह ऊँचे और महान वृक्ष को आधार देने योग्य नही रहती। इसलिए सहजयोग की नींव कठीन तथा पथरीली जमीन चाहिए की धरती के साथ झगड़ना पडता है। यह झगड़ना भी अपने हित मे ही होता है। इसी झगड़े से जड़ें सभी परिस्थिती जान कर, अत्यंत गहरी उतरती है और धरती में सहज योग के वृक्ष की गहन नींब बिठा रही होती है। यह सहजयोगीयों का अंतर्योग पाने के लिए महामाया का प्रसाद ही समझना चाहिए। परिस्थिती के साथ झगडा करना हमारा कर्तव्य है, मगर परिस्थिती बहुत उत्तम तथा चारों दिशाओं से नरम होना उपयोगी नही है, यह सत्य भी सभी सहजयोगीयों को जानना जरूरी है। सहजयोग में हर चीज प्रार्थना में माँगी जाए तो जरूर प्राप्त होती है । सहजयोग में शरणागति मे ही अर्पण शक्ति का प्रभाव है, इसी से आपकी प्रगति होती है। पर ही बिठाई जाती है। पहले यह काम थोडा कठीन और असाध्य लगता है। फिर भी यह जान लेना सत्य को खोजने वाले बहुत ही कम होते है, फिर भी सत्य सभी को बताना चाहिए। जिन्हे इसका बोध होगा वह जरूर इसे ग्रहण करेंगे, और नही हुआ तो भी सत्य की शक्ति व्यर्थ नही जाएगी। यह चैतन्य स्वरूपा है, यह लहरीयों के माध्यम से सभी लोगों को अवश्य ही स्पर्श करेगी। अगर इसका परिणाम मृत वस्तु पर होता है तो यह तो मानव जाति है जो अधिक जागृत है। धीरे-धीरे सहजयोग मानव को भवसागर से पार करा रहा है। मा.ल अब तक पुजन के अतरिक्त कोई व्यवयथा मिली नही है और इसके बिना मनुष्य के जड़ बंध छुटते नही। महाराजजी का कहना है कि आप साक्षात देवी स्वरूपा है और देवी स्तुतिप्रिया कहलाती है '। इसीलिए स्तुति बिना कुछ मंगल नही होता। और जब तक हमारा आगमन नही हो, चक्रकार्यान्वित नही होते, ब्रह्मा, विष्णु, महेश आदि देवगण प्रसन्न नहीं होते। जब तक आप हमे मान्य नही करते, तब तक श्री गणेश, ट्विस्त, हनुमान या भैरव कोई भी जागृत नही होते । हमें सभी का ध्यान रखना पड़ता है अन्यथा वह अपनी दृष्टि हटा लेते है और उसी मे श्रीकृष्ण का राजकारण शुरू रहता है इसलिए हम सिर्फ नाममात्र ही 'महामाया' है लेकिन सारी किमया आप की और इन बादशाहों की है। C 18

The higher lake, Manasarovar, is round like the sun, and a lower lake, Rakastal is the shape of the crescent moon. The two lakes represent the solar and the lunar forces respectively. The inner consciousness of man (the solar force) is often compared to the Manasarovar lake. When the thoughts of the mind are stilled, the reflection of the higher Bouddhic mind and Atmic awareness is seen. Manas mean Mind in Sanskrit. The crescent lake, Rakastal partakes of the lunar or dark forces and this is reflected in the name which comes from Rakshasas or demons; beings who are totally under the sway of the lower desires and impulses (i.e. lunar forces). A visit to the vibrant Himalaya and reverent feeling for the holy river Shri Ganga is an unexpressed yearning for the Sahaja Yogis, who can only pray at Her Holy Lotus Feet worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are there, and pray to them to bless us with Devi Shakti to salvage the entire creations on Earth. Continued from page 17 the Water in the Manipura [Nabhi], the Fire abiding in the Svadhisthana, the Air in the Heart [Anahat], the Ether above [Vishuddhi], and Manas between the eyebrows [Agya] and thus broken through the entire Kula path. It would be possible to compare the final lotus (Sahasrara) with the Keter (or crown Sefirot) but, as commented above, direct comparison of the chakras and the Sefirot seems to the present writer to be unnecessary, and demeaning to both mystical traditions.

 Paintings of Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606 1669 A.D.) Rembrandt was born in Leiden (Holland) on July 15, 1606. His full name was Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn. He was son of a miller. His his 'Christ Healing the Sick' In the foreground and the mother, a member of the right are great multitudes following Jesus, wanting to Dutch Reformed Church, be healed.

As the focal point of the composition, Jesus relatively modest means, his parents took great care of invites the little children to come to him while healing his education. Rembrandt began his studies at the those who so desperately believe in his transforming Latin School, and at the age of 14 was enrolled at the University of Leiden. The program did not interest In so personifying Jesus, Rembrant refused to present a him, and he soon left to study art first with a local master, and then, in Amsterdam, with Pieter Lastman loVing and forgiving Jesus.

Instead, his was the incarnate, ministering to all classes and empathizing community of Amsterdam, many of whom were The old woman reading in such a thoughtful manner is St Anna the Prophetess. According to the biblical story she was a woman of extreme old age who served God day and night in the Temple. She was present when Joseph and Mary brought their son Jesus to the Temple. St Anna immediately recognised Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. Arising out ofa core beliefthat all things descend from God and are not to be scorned, he had a admiration for life in its totality. All humans were worthy of his esteem, even beggars and outcasts. Unlike the detached observer, Rembrandt identified with the dispossessed and demonstrated a sincere sympathy for the afflicted. E20

 Christ is presented to the people, half-naked, his hands m chains, surrounded by soldiers, high on the balcony of the Roman governor Pilate's palace. Pontius Pilate, bearing a turban and sceptre, points to him uttering the words 'Ecce homo' ('Ecce homo' is Latin for 'Behold, the man'). The story of Pontius Pilate is told in various books of the Bible. The 'Ecce homo' episode is from John 19:5). - Behold the Man! Standing slightly behind Christ and Pilate is Barabbas, an infamous murderer. The throng stands before the balcony. Pilate lets the people decide which of the two prisoners may go The crowd, influenced by the high priests, choose to set Barabbas free; Jesus will be crucified. Rembrandt shows Anna deeply absorbed in studying the Bible. The light comes from behind her, touching on her Oriental-looking head-dress stitched with gold thread, and her red velvet eloak and shining directly on the Bible with her hand pointing to the Hebrew letters. Rembrandt painted this old worman's hand with great care, with its thin wrinkled skin and clearly visible veins. Anna's face, however, is hidden in shadow free. Rambrant often painted people. Many people wanted their portraits painted by Rambrant probably because the painting of people he did looked almost real. Another one of his talents was his ability to paint light, dark and people's shadow so well. He also painted himself. That is why during his life Rembrandt painted over 100 self portraits. He did around 600 paintings, 300 etchings and 1,400 drawings. Some of the other famous paintings most of which are at display at Rijks meuseum, Amsterdam are The Night Watch(1642). The Three Crosses(1653) Rembrandt's greatest and most dramatie print is the Three Crosses, a work which has all the power of a painting. It shows the deepest point of Christ's Philosopher in Meditation (1632), The Music Party suffering: the moment of his death on the cross at (626), The Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (1662):, Golgotha. Massive beams of light slice through the Supper at Emmaus (1630). darkness. When they comne to Calvary where they crucified him, the malefactors stand on the right hand and one on the left. Jesus then said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." The people stood beholding the light that descended on the entire country. The light focuses on Christ, the two murderers who were crucified beside him and the crowd round about. Descent from the Cross(l634), Shri Mataji Mentions Rembrandt in a Talk: "That (Ego) is the reason we cannot have masters any more in art. We can't have Rembrandt, we can't. Poor Rembrandt himself must have suffered a lot, you know Gauguin suffered a lot, all these artists suffered a lot, even Michaelangelo suffered a lot. Not only monetarily but otherwise, criticise, criticise, criticise, so I think people have given up. I met an artist who had done lots of artwork and I said why don't you show me? He said 'No I don't want to show you. It's created for myself. I said I would like to see. I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I said why don't you show. He said no use, people will just criticise, I do it for my own pleasure; they'll just spoil the whole joy of my creation.

 Encounter With Love [A report published in a magazine called Ziereus, May 1983. The uriter, nho met Shri Mataji before she visited the U.S.A, received his self-realization during the intervien.] The aim was to talk to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi about her forthcoming North American tour. What happened was something that is only now, a week later, starting to make sense. I telephoned the number Shri Mataji's followers in New York had given me, and found myself, an hour later, knocking on the carved door of a five storied terraced house in London's classy Knightsbridge district. The door was opened by a young Indian who ushered me into a reception room as ornate and rich as a jewel box. Furniture pink crystal covered with rose silk, tables inlaid with ivory, carved and gilded wooden screens, pale chandeliers. I heard Shri Mataji before I saw her. "How are you? How is America?" Then the lady appeared. Short, plump, with long dark hair falling free and a smile that chips away all defences. Tea was ordered and I was asked to sit down. Before I could get the first question into gear Mataji asked, "Do you know what the chakras are?" Imumbled something about subtle energy centres along the spine. Shri "That's right," she said, and tapped the base of her neck with her index finger. "This one is called the Visbuddbi. In the universe the VVishuddhi is North America. Australia is the lowest chakra, the Mooladhara. India is the Kundalini, ahich can link all the chakras together."She traced a line from the base of the spine to the top of her head, "But America is the Vishuddhi, isn't it? Such an important chakra." Shri Mataji then touched the red spot on her forehead. "This chakra," she said, "is the Agnya. It is presided over by Lord Jesus Christ, isn't it? The Agnya is forgiveness. It shows that the spirit cannot be destroyed, just as Christ could not be destroyed, but rose again, didn't he?" Shri Mataji quietly contemplated the risen Christ for a moment, then jabbed her fingers towards the base of her neck again. "The Vishuddhi, its presiding deity, you could say, is Lord Krishna. The Vishuddhi stands for diplomacy, sweetness, self- esteem, communication and collectivity-like Did you know that? - a realized soul. You have had many great men. Roosevelt now-be said, Poverty anywbere is a threat to prosperity everynhere'. So clear. Amerita is so great. It is protected by Lord Krishna's discus." Shri Mataji held up the index finger of her right hand and twirled it and I swear I could see a bright glittering disc whirling round. "Ar long as that discus is there," she said, "America can never be invaded. %3D your Abraham Lincoln. He stood for collectivity. Abraham Lincoln was a saint- "Conld that pratection ever be withdraw?" I asked. Shri Mataji shrugged expressively, and raised her eyebrows high. "Perhaps," she said. "If the land of diplomacy stopped being diplomatic, the land of communications communicated bad things, the land of sweetness turned bitter, then yes. Perbaps Lord Krishna might witháraw the protection."Suddenly she laughed. "On ry tour I shall tell everybody bow to stop that from happening." I asked Shri Mataji if she was visiting North America just to sound such a warning, "There are seekers of money, seekers after power, seekers of physical gratification," she replied, "and then there are people who have done all those things and are now seeking the truth, seeking 22

 their spirit, seeking God. There are many, many seekers of truth in America. Great, great seekers. Oh so great. I uant to meet them. Show them how they can get what they have been looking for, probably since ages, lifetimes even, their self-realization. "What is that exactly?" I hadn't yet asked one question from my carefully prepared list. Tea arrived. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the spellbinding visionary, turned into Mrs. C.P. Srivastava, the attentive hostess. Did I have the right amount of sugar and milk? Would I have a biscuit? (Which turned out to be a cookie.) "Self-realization," said Shri Mataji, "is the yoga, the Hnion. The joining of the microcosm to the macrocosm, you could say. The raising of the energy in each of us called Kundalini. There is no English word for it. You should invent one. There is a good job for you. Invent a good English word for Kundalini. The linking of that energy with the all-pervading energy of God, that is what self-realization is." "What exactly does it do?" I felt a fool at the naivety of the question. "It brings abont a change in awareness. You feel it as a cool breeze, cool vibrations, you could say, on the top of the head and on the hands. It is an actnal happening! Not self- certification. Not saying 'I am born again!" or 'I am this or that!" You actually become! If you desire self-realization and you get it, then you become collectively conscious, truly sweet and truly diplomatic. A true blue American, you could say." And the joyous laughter flowed into every corner of the room. I asked Shri Mataji if she was the only one who could grant this self-realization. "Oh no," came the reply, "once you have it you ean pass it on to others.""Butit all seems to start from you,"I said. "Why you?" Shri Mataji's face became serious. "As far as I knon," she said, "I am the only one who can do it en-masse. Once, in India, 6000 villagers got it at the same time. But if there is someone else nho can do it, then I am only too happy to retire. I am sixty years old." (At times she looks half that.) "I am happily married. I bave a beautiful house as you can see. It would be good to settle down and stop all this travelling around all the time. But until I find someone else who can do it, then it is up to me, isn't it? To meet the seekers and let them know bow to gain this gift that is their own, their right, this Union with God." "Could I receive this gift?" I asked. Shri Mataji's eyes danced, "Put your hand above your bead," she said. I did as I was told. There was a faint, oh so faint coolness on my hand. I looked round to see if there could be a draught coming from anywhere, but there was no air conditioning and the windows were closed. "You feel it?" I nodded, tentatively. "That is the beginning. Perbaps while you were drinking your tea you said to yourself, Td like that experience,' and,"Shri Mataji snapped her fingers, "you gat it. It can only happen if you desire it. Give me your band." She took my hand and started tracing a cross over the palm. "You think too much," she said. "Your mind is husy, bury, busy, thinking away." From that moment on it wasn't. It was hardly thinking at all. "Too much thinking can give people diabetes. It is not sugar that causes diabetes, it's thinking. We can cure diabetes. After realization. And this nen thing AIDS, after realization we can cure that too. With realization you become your own gru. You can diagnose your own problems and those of others, and you can cure them. Anybody with their realization and the desire to develop their spirit, can cure and be cured." At this point a wave of most pleasant well-being swept over me. It wasn't a trance or a hypnotic state (I've experienced those)- it was a fecling of deep peace. I regretted my next question. It caused the smile to fade from Shri Mataji's face, "How much are you going to charge Americans for this experience?" "Itis part of evolution," she replied. "It is a gift of love from God, nho is the ocean of love, the ocean af compassion. Hon can you pay for that? God does not understand money. How can you pay for your evolution? Did you pay to stand up un two legs? Anyway, why would I want money? I come from a wealthby family. My husband is Secretary General of the United Nations International Maritime Organization bere in London. I do not need money. I do not accept money." Shri Mataji let go of my händ and smiled. "Better now?" she asked. I nodded. "That is because brain is not so active. You are more balanced, more centered, more relaxed. Have some more tea?" I put my hand above my head your The coolness was still there. Perhaps even stronger. "There are so many great seekers in North again. America," she said. "I want to meet them."Now, almost a week later, when I sit down quietly, that sense of peace and relaxed happiness returns.I am hoping it won't go away! 23 2

 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-2.txt 
 I have met Her Holiness
SHRI MATAJI NIRMALA
DEVI
Her nature is kind and
gentle.
She is a mother.
She is above us, yet always with us.
She often gives advice and counselling, but at other times just listens.
She knows a person's problem enen before they speak.
She always understands a man or woman's dilemma better than they do.
Her way is gentle, for She can as casily show us the answer by means of a story or an action
or a smile, as another person can through words of harshness.
When She speaks, people listen. They do not interrupt or argue.
They do not second guess Her motives or interpret Her words for their own ends.
The wise know that Her words are better than their own.
They call Her "Shri Mataji" or "Mother."
They listen with all their being.
They try to bring each of Her qualities one at a time into their own lives.
Sbri Mataji says She knouws nothing
but when She shops She always gets the best price.
When She saves, the money is always there when needed.
She rarely buys things for Herself.
To Het, the spending of money is like the sowing of seeds.
With time and love, they sprout into things greater than coins and bills.
It is like magic.
about money or banks,
She says She knews nothing of tars. She cannot drive.
She says that signal lights and traffic control are the jobs of men.
But She is the greatest of travellers None can keep up with Her.
It is as if She sits and everything else moves around Her.
She moves in this way throughout the world
and for those whose eyes fall upon Her, a blessing unfolds in their hearts.
com
Shri Mataji can judge men and women finely.
She knows them each because they are all Her children
1
 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-3.txt 
 and a mother knows her children because they are born from her being.
She can see into them. She can still their minds. Her hand rests upon their souls,
She hears the whispering of their thoughts.
Shri Mataji never gossips or speakr ill of others.
She sees the best in us all, so that we each can see the best in ourselves.
She remembers our talents, our children, our tastes,
She calls upon us, when we need direction.
Her direction is the greatest of blessings.
Fen are the rules that She gives.
She trusts us each to guide ourself.
She wants us to grow and love each other.
We try each day to be our best for Her.
Shri Mataji knows literature.
She told us about William Shakespeare and Somerset Maugham.
She introduced us to Tagore and Kabir.
She understands the subtleties of the Russian spirit in the words of Leo Tolstoy.
She reads books, but best of all She read our hearts.
Shri Mataji says She is only a mother.
She says She is only a grandmother and a wife.
Yet She knows about architecture and music and fine art and politics and biology and astronomy.
She knows about engineering and history and economics and all the natural and man-made sciences.
She has knowledge about realms for which the men and women of this world
have not yet even defined names to describe.
She knows these arts like no other.
And of each discipline, She speaks freely, without a hint of bragging or showing off Her knowledge.
She speaks as a teacher or a sage whose knowledge flows like water to merely quench a thirst
and not to drown.
Shri Mataji is compassion.
She is love and honour. She is dignity and bravery.
She is knowledge and dharma and confidence and strength.
We do not need dictionaries for these words.
We can look to Her and can see.
We see Her sit for hours greeting a queue of people, strangers and seekers of truth, each troubled in small
She lifts the weight from their shoulders.
We see Her sit through the night, listening to the music of amateurs.
She praises talent. She helps us to appreciate each other.
ways.
She takes time where everyone else is too busy.
When She takes rest, She continues to work.
When She takes food, She feeds Her children.
We saw Her in all the great cities of the world.
We saw Her at the United Nations, at the Royal Albert Hall.
She took us to the Ganapatipule. She sent us to the Ulluru.
In the smallest village without even a roadway, She travelled on a cart pulled by an oxen.

 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-4.txt 
 On a jumbo jet or an underground commuter train,
She journeyed with us.
We greeted Her at airports.
She came to our homes.
She asks nothing of us that we are not able to give.
She never gives up on us, despite our mistakes.
Shri Mataji speaks well and at length.
Her lectures and talks cover all range of topics.
She tells us about our spirit, our ascent and our duty,
but She also tells us about our marriages and our
children, our hygiene and health.
She guides us with the steady motion of a shepherd
and the gentle hand of a mother.
She makes us laugh when we forget the joy. Her
words flow.
They are studied and remembered and imbibed by
each of us to the best of our ability.
We try to understand the knowledge that is before us.
Many things we forget, but still we are drawn closer to Her.
For some, there is no understanding in Shri Mataji's words.
The language She speaks is not their own.
But nonetheless, they know what She is saying.
They do not know the words, but they know the meaning.
Her voice comes from thcir own heart.
For others, the words that are songs of praise are unknown to them. They are hard to follow
The quickness of the music leaps ahead and the words remain unlearnt and foreign.
But somehow, the music rises from a distant time and is as familiar as this morning's sunrise.
When they sing of Shri Mataji, the beat is their breath and lyrics their blood.
And for others still,
Shri Mataji has never been within sight of their eyes.
They have never seen Her, but yet they can recognize. They can remember.
Without meeting, they know Her as She knows them.
From Benin and Belarus, from Aruba and Alberta and Reunion, there is an understanding.
On the shores of Ganapatipule and in the hills of Cabella,
there is recognition beyond nations and races and people.
Our body is one in that knowledge.
And non, for each of us, in our bearts,
we hold special a memory of our time with Her.
One recalls how his Mother greeted him at an airport, remembering his name.
Another retains the comforting guidance She gave in a troubled time.
Another still, reflects on the way She held a tea cup
or smiled with widened eyes at the faces of our children.
We remember each of the flowers we gave to Her.
Our deepest desire was to give all of our selves.
 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-5.txt 
 We wanted to surrender, but held out only a flower.
Accidents and mischief and calamities never happen
to Shri Mataji.
Around Her there often appears to be chaos and confusion.
But with Her, there is a calmness, a stillness that comes from knowing
Her mere breath gives order.
Her name is Placidity.
Trouble is barred from Her presence.
And then, at othber times, we bave another glimpse of Shri Mataji.
In Her photographs we occasionally see beyond.
A dancing vibration, a haloed glow, a bouquet of streaming lights
speak to
us of something more.
At first we turn away in disbelief, unable to understand, skeptical.
Then these images, windows created by our own cameras,
open wide for us, displaying the universe.
With recognition, our hearts are filled.
She is the composer and the choreographer,
the lyricist and the conductor.
She fashions the instruments and the music.
She creates the musicians.
Each of us anait the cue of Her haton.
Her music is beauty and we know
not always, but when we reflect upon it, we know
that the music is not ouurs.
As much as we practise, we know it is Her breath in our flutes,
Her hand guiding ours upon the bow.
The strings, the bridge, the fingerboard are all illusion.
She is the only reality.
Sometimes we forget,
but when we remember, we try again to be only with Her in tune.
Shri Mataji's way is noble.
She is a mother.
She is very much above us.
She is always and forever with us.

मनुष्य जाति की उत्क्रांति हमारे सुक्ष्यतंत्र मे स्थित चक्रों तथा
आत्मिक उन्नति को प्रतिबिंबित करती है। नाभी चक्र उत्क्रांति के उस
बिंदु को दर्शाती है जहाँ मानव को आश्रय के लिए घर की जरूरत
महसूस हुई तथा जब परिवार संस्था संतोष प्राप्त करने का स्त्रोत बनी
ना कि सिर्फ पुनरूत्पादन का जरिया । अआत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद हमारे
आध्यात्मिक जागृति से यह ग्रहस्थिक संतोष हमारे जीवन में महसूस
किये गये संतोष में परिवर्तित हुआ।
Pभ
ै।
गुण:
संतोष असल में नाभी चक्र का मुख्य गुण है । कई गर्मयकृत' (hot
liver) के लोग प्राकृतिक रूप से चिड़चिड़े स्वभाव के होते हैं। उनके
लिए चिंता बिना जीवन की कल्पना असंभव है । वे छोटी-छोटी बात
पर अपनी नाराजगी जाहिर करते है। जब हमारा चित्त प्रकाशित होता
है तब हम चीजों को वास्तविक स्वरूप में देखना प्रारंभ करते है और
तब चिन्ता एक असाधारण सी घटना बन जाती है। निर्विचारिता की
शांति में हम अपने आप को अत्यंत तृप्त पाते है। तब हम जान जाते हैं
की आत्मा को बाहरी दिखावे में कोई महत्व नही है । नाभी चक्र की
प्रार्थना है श्रीमाताजी, मै अपने आत्मा में पुरी तरह संतुष्ट हूँ।
नाभी चक्र शारीरिक तथा आर्थिक कल्याण का केन्द्र है । जैसे जैसे आदमी में सृजनशीलता का विकास हुआ। उसने सृष्टि के संपदा का उपयोग अपने फायदे के
लिए करना सीख लिया, इसी से उसके संपन्नता का विकास हुआ । संपन्नता उत्क्रांति की महत्वपूर्ण सिढी है और घन यह आदान-प्रदान का योग्य साघन है,
जिस से आदमी अपनी मूलभूत आवश्यकताओं को पूर्ण कर सकता है। अगर हमारे पास मूलभूत आवश्यकताओं को पूर्ण करने का साधन नहीं हुआ तो हमारा
चित्त उस तरफ आकर्षित होता है और हम सत्य के मार्ग से विचलित होने लगेंगे । हम बुद्धी तथा बहुआयामी शरीर से आशीर्वादित है जिससे हम काम करके
अपनी आवश्यकताएँ पूर्ण करने का साधन जुटा सकें जब हमारी जरूरते पूर्ण हो जाती है तब ऐसी चीजें हमें नही सताती और ना ही हमारे विकास में बाधा बनती
हैं।
लेकिन कभी-कभी हम भटक जाते हैं । मूलभूत जरूरतें पाने की इच्छा जब कभी न पूर्ण होने वाले अति सामान्य चीजों को प्राप्त करने की अतृप्त इच्छा में
तबदिल होती है तो यही से प्रारंभ होता है आदि भौतिकता का अस्तित्व । संपन्न होना कोई गलत बात नही है। कठिनाई तब होती है जब पैसे की अधिकता हो
जाती है । सिर्फ पैसा होने के लिए पैसा पाने की इच्छा ही लालच है । और तब यह जरूरतों की मर्यादायें लांघ कर बिमारी बन जाती है जो विकास को धीमा
करती है। कंजूसीपन तथा धन के जमाव की प्रवत्ति से जरूरत की जगह धन का बहाव रूक जाता है और यह मतलबी विचारधारा तथा मन को दर्शाता है जो
सृष्टी के मूलभूत सच्चाई से अनभिज्ञ है । सृष्टि में सभी कुछ बहुता रहता है । धन भी इसके लिए अपवाद नही है । सृष्टि के सभी अंगों में शक्ति का बहाव
आवश्यक है।
बाटने से हम यह सिखते हैं कि उदारता हमे कितने उँचाई पर ले जाती है और बटोरते रहने की प्रवृत्त से उन्नति थम जाती है जो नकारात्मक तथा रून्धे दिमाग
को जन्म देती है। ऐसा आदमी समाज के लिए अहितकर है और समाज में रोग पैदा कर सकता है। मतलबी स्वभाव और लालची वातावरण में समस्या का
निर्माण होता है और आधुनिक जीवनशैली को दूषित करता है। हमारी आध्यात्मिक उन्नति तृप्ता पर निर्भर करती है और तृप्ता हमारे खुले हृदय पर तथा
उदारता पर निभ्रर करती है। अगर हम दूसरों को भी बाँटते रहे तो हमे उस का पहले फायदा होता है और नाभी चक्र भी सुधारता है।
धर्म ः
नाभी चक्र का और एक पहलू है धर्म या जीवन में योग्य आचरण । अग्र हमे अंदर से संतुष्ट रहना है तो हमें अपने बाह्य में भी संतोष लाना पड़ेगा । इसका मतलब
धार्मिक जीवन के फायदों को हमे सराहना होगा। यह कृत्रिम रूप से नहीं पाई जाती बल्के प्राकृतिक रूप से इमे आत्म साक्षात्कार के बाद हमारे चित्त से प्राप्त

 होती है। जिस तरह सोने की चमक कभी कम नही होती उसी तरह धर्म को कभी बदला नही जा सकता। घार्मिक आचार की कोई तुलनात्मक स्थिति नहीं होती।
कोई भी कार्य मूलभूत दृष्टि से या तो गलत या फिर सही होता है। घर्म उत्क्रांति का मुप्त नियम है, जिससे मनुष्य की उत्क्रांति अमीबा से इस रूप तक हुई है। यही
नियम हमारे आध्यात्मिक उन्नति को सुरक्षित तथा पोषित करता है । उत्क्रांति में दिशानिर्देश के रूप में 'दस आदेश' सबसे अधिक शक्तिशाली घर्म- नियम का
आवाहन हुआ। जिन्होने हमेशा इन मूलभूत सदाचार नियमों का पालन किया है उन्होने आत्मासाक्षात्कार के शक्ति को सही अर्थ में महसूस किया है जोलोग
आत्मसाक्षात्कार के पहले इन आचारसंहिताओं का महत्व नही जानते थे वे बाद में स्वाभाविक ही जानने लगे । यहाँ तक कि आत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद अपने
घार्मिक आचरण के प्रतिकार रूप में पेट क्षेत्र के भौतिक संकेत भी महसूस कर सकते हैं। कुछ लोग तो आश्चर्य में पड़ जाते है कि उनका पेट आध्यात्मिक कार्य
के लिए संवेदनशील हो जाता है और प्रतिकार करता है। असल में ज्यादा समय हम अपनी आत्मा के सौंदर्य का आनंद लेते है इसलिए अधार्मिक चीजों के लिए
हमारे पास समय ही नहीं रहता। जीवित रहने और विकास के लिए उत्क्रांति के नियमों का प्रादुर्भाव हमारे अन्दर होने लगता है। हमें हमेशा याद रखना है कि यह
मार्गदर्शक बाते हमारे अनुशरण के लिए उदाहरण स्वरूप है। हम किसी काम के लिए बाध्य नही है । सहजयोग में हम खुद के गुरू बन जाते है। चैतन्य लैहरियाँ
हमें अपनी स्थिति बयान करती है और उसी के अनुरूप निर्णय लेना चाहिए। आत्म साक्षात्कार का सीधा फायदा है कि हम अपनी कमजोरियाँ देखना बंद करके
साक्षी स्वरूप में हम अपने सत्य स्वरूप को देखते है । एक तरीके से हम ही अपना अंतिम फैसला लेते हैं।
परंपरा:
नाभी चक्र के अधिष्टित देवता है श्री विष्णु जो सारे संसार के सरंक्षक है । श्री विष्णु ही है जो हमारे धर्म के आधारभूत है और जो हमे हमारे उत्थान की ओर ले
जाते है। नाभी चक्र की शक्ति का स्थान गृहलक्ष्मी का है जो पत्नी स्थान यानि की गृह देवी का स्थान है । पत्नी का आदर होना चाहिए तथा उसे भी आदर की
मर्ति होनी चाहिए । श्री लक्ष्मी हम मे शांति का सरोत है जो हमे हमारे आध्यात्मिक उन्नति और ध्यान के माध्यम से प्राप्त होती है।
स्थूल भीतिक आयाम:
नाभी चक्र पेट का कार्य संचालन करता है। अगर पेट का कार्य सुचारू रूप से नही हुआ तो हमारे भोजन का पाचन, आत्मसात विधी प्रभावित होगी । इसलिए
पेट बहुत महत्वपूर्ण अंग है । हमारे खाने के प्रति रवैया तथा किस प्रकार अन्न ग्रहण करते है इससे हमारे पाचक रसों तथा ग्रंथियों पर असर होता है अगर खाना
जल्दबाजी में, गुस्से से या चिंता ग्रास होकर खाये तो उसका पाचन ठिक से नही होता है, क्योंकि हमारे पेट के मॉसपेशी उस वक्त तनाव में कार्य करते हैं और
अपना कार्य सुचारू रूप से नहीं कर पाते। हमे संतुलित भोजन लेना चाहिए जिससे खाना पेट में आसानी से आगे बढे और पाचक रसों से सुचारू रूप से पचाया
जा सके योग्य पोषण के लिए शॉंतिपूर्ण रूप से भोजन करना बहुत आवश्यक है, यह एक ध्यान क्रिया है।
नाभी चक्र यकृत के कार्य संचालन के लिए भी जिम्मेदार होता है जो हमारे ध्यान के लिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है चित्त को ज्यादा तनावपूर्ण स्थिती में नहीं रखना
चाहिये । इसलिए यकृत की तरफ विशेष रूप से ध्यान देना चाहिए। (ज्योकि अयोग्य भोजन से या उत्लेजकों के कारण अतितापित होने को संवेदनशील होता
है) इसलिए हमें इस तरह का व्यवहार करना चाहिये की हमारा चित्त बहुत ज्यादा सोचने तथा योजनाओं की वजह से अति कार्यशीलता का शिकार न बने ।
नाभी चक्र की दशा:
नाभी चक्र कई वजह से कमजोर पड़ सकता है । हमारा बायां नाभी चक्र घरेलू समस्या वश या अंति पैसे की चिंता के कारण खराब हो सकता है। आत्म
साक्षात्कार के बाद हम ईश्वरी शक्ति पर भरोसा करना सिखते है । देवी शक्ति सदैव हमारा संरक्षण करती है। हम सभी प्रकार की जिम्मेदारियों को संभालने में
सक्षम बन जाते है और हम अपने कर्तव्य बड़े आनंदपूर्ण ढंग से निभाते हैं । तब हम यह जान जाते है कि परिवार जो समाज का अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण घटक है संभाला
जाना चाहिए और प्यार, एकता तथा आदरपूर्ण वातावरण में ही पोषित होना चाहिए।
भोजन के बारे में अधिक सोचना, लालचवश अधिक खाना या अधिक उपवास रखना दोनो ही नाभी चक्र पर बुरा प्रभाव करते है। यह पेट को उत्तेजित रखता है
ज़िससे कि उर्जा बहाव बाधित होती है। अविवेकिय उपवास से भी इस चक्र को हानि पहुचती है । हम उपवास के माध्यम से कभी भी आत्मा को नहीं प्राप्त कर
सकते । किसी भी डॉक्टर को पूछिये, हमारे पेट के लिये नियमित तथा प्रमाणित आहार आवश्यक है । उपवास से हमारा चित्त खाने के तरफ ज्यादा भागता है।
जब शरीर में भोजन की आवश्यकता होती है तो वह संकेत भेजता है । हमें किसी चक या उसके नियम के विरोध में काम नही करना चाहिए । मद्यपान करना तथा
अयोग्य आहार नाभी चक्र के लिये उपयुक्त नही है।
आत्मसाक्षात्कार के बाद भोजन के प्रति हमारा रवैया बदल जाता है। हम किसी अतिविशेष भोजन के विषय में न सोचते हुए अच्छे भोजन का आनंद लेते है जो
हमें चैतन्य प्रदान करे। हम भोजन के प्रति सूक्ष्म तथा अलिप्त रवैया विकसित करने लगते है और संतोष जो हमें किसी विशिष्ट पकवान से मिलता है वह हम
साधारण आहार से प्राप्त करने लगते है।
नाभी चक्र का शुद्धीकरण
मध्य नाभी :
पंचतत्वों का उपयोग:
मोमबत्ती क्रिया पेट के क्षेत्र में मोमबत्ती घुमाना बहुत प्रभावशाली होता है।
नमक-पानी क्रिया - अपने दोनों पैर नमकयुक्त गुनगुने पानी में रखके ध्यान करने से चक्र को बहुत फायदा पहुंचता है (सभी नीचे के चक्रों के लिए भी) थोड़ी देर
धीरे-धीरे शांतिपूर्ण ढंग से लंबी श्वास लेकर इसी तरह वापस बाहर छोड़िये ।
प्रार्थनाः
श्रीमाताजी मैं अपनी आत्मा में पूरी तरह संतुष्ट हूँ ।

 SWEET NIRVICHARITA
When I was small and full of glee
A little thought once came to me.
"Hello. I'm who you are," it said
And quickly it filled up my head.
From this time on, my once cool brain
Got loud and hot under the strain
Of the ego that waged war,
Leaving my soul broken and poor.
I grew up lost inside this web
Of words and vanity instead
Of the freedom I once knew,
When I was young and fresh and new.

Decades passed without respite
From the noise that dulled my life.
Every day I hoped and prayed
That from this heat I would be saved.
चैंतन्ययुक्त जल ग्रहण करें।
कोहनी तथा घुटनों को मालिश करें।
Then one busy Christmas Eve,
When I just could not believe
That innocence could ever return

चक्र को बहुत फायदा होता है।
अपने दोनों पैर नमकयुक्त गुनगुने पानी में रखकर ध्यान करने से
Bringing the joy for which I yearned,
I fell into a fathomless sleep
And heard a sound rise from the deep.
It started with an 'Ah', then 'Ommm'
And rose into a sonic boom.

श्रीमाताजी कृपा करके मुझे उदार बनाईये ।
And suddenly I was aware
Of a baby's loving stare.

५) उदारता तथा मंगलता के गुण को विकसित करें और कजूसीपन
को त्यागे ।
Its radiance filled up my mind
With something sweet from beyond time.
And then I heard Its Mother sigh.
That sigh resounded through the sky.
And I felt Her kiss my head
And the Wind became my friend.
I rose to heights of silent Love
Where Joy rains down from high above,
And saw the Sun, not as a star,
But as a glorious Avatar.
दाया नाभी:
पंचतत्वों का उपयोग : नमक-पानी क्रिया के लिए ठंडे नमकीन पानी का
इस्तेमाल करें ।
Oh, how my heart did dance and sing
In that sweet, eternal spring!
I thanked the Mother and Her Son
For all the wonderful things they'd done.
सामान्य उपदेशः
१) चर्बीयुक्त पदार्थों का तथा दुध से बने पदार्थों का सेवन कम करें।
२) ऐसे चीजों का आहार में समावेश करे जो यकृत को ठंडक पहुचायें जैसे
की गन्ना, अद्रक, सफेद चावल, छांछ और ताज़े फल तथा सब्जियाँ ।
(See liver diet)
३) गुस्से पर काबू पाने का प्रयत्न करें ।
यकृत पर बर्फ रखें (ध्यान के समय भी जब चित्त एकाग्र ना हो पाये
और निर्विचार स्थिति ना आये)
Waking up, I smiled to sce
A sunbeam on my Christmas tree,
The darkness of my life had passed
And here I was at home, at last.

 Shakhambari
Devi
This year on 14 January we worshipped Shri
Mataji on Makar Sankranti Puja as Shakhambari
Devi. Shakhambari Devi is the goddess of fertility
of Mother Earth. When we worship Shakhambari
Devi we worship vegetables and fruits which grow
by the blessings of Mother Earth in the process of
creation in the plant kingdom, and the same is offered to the Goddesses. There is a Shakhambari Devi

Legend has it that this goddess helped the living creatures to survive only upon plants and vegetables,
when no water was available on earth, for as long as hundred years. Thus, she came to be known as
ShakhambariDevi, that is the goddess who feed us upon vegetables.

Stating in botanical terms, there exists a form of energy behind the growth of plants and vegetables;
the evolution of this energy is caused due to the multiplication and compounding of atoms. The same
energy has been worshipped as goddess Shakhambari in the legends.

The History of Shakhambari Devi
Long time ago, there was a great spiritual master named 'Durgam'. He mastered all the vedas by
of Lord Brahma and received a boon from him that he will not be defeated in a battle even
the
grace
against the gods. After receiving such a boon, he went on rampage all around the earth and stole the
four vedas. He defeated Lord Indra in a battle. Subsequently there was no rain on earth for a century as
Lord Indra, the rain-god, was imprisoned by Durgam. The living beings starved for water. In the
absence of vedas the Brahmans could not perform religious rites.
 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-11.txt 
 Sensing the disastrous
consequences of Durgam's rule,
the gods took refuge with
Maha Devi', the great goddess.
They prayed to her, "Oh
Mother, the way you killed
'Shumb and Nishumb' and
brought an end to the miseries
of mankind, in the same way,
kindly kill Durgam." On seeing
her people in distress, the eyes
of goddess were full of tears.
She looked at the gods and
saints through hundred eyes.
The water gushed out of her
eyes and thousands of streams overflowed with water. The forests became again green and lands fit
for tilling. Oceans, rivers and ponds were again full of water and the gods were again happy. The
miseries of people disappeared. As the goddess of hundred eyes looked at her subjects with the eyes of
pity, so the gods named her 'Shatakshi' and worshipped her. When whole world was dry for want of
rain, then goddess 'Shatakshi' created vegetation out of her body and saved world from starvation. For
this act of goddess she is also famous as "Shakhambari Devi.
After restoring order on earth, the goddess asked gods, "How can I help you further?" The gods
prayed to her and asked, "Please return us the four vedas, which were stolen by Durgam". Then
goddess fought a fierce battle with Durgam and killed him and restored Vedas. The goddess was
also called Durga for killing the demon Durgam. In- fact the three different names Shatakshi,
Shakhambari and Durga are names of the same goddess.

 HIMAL AVAS
A SAHAJA INSIGHT
Continued from December 2004
The Himalaya has immensely influenced the life in the Indian subcontinent in more than one way
since the ancient times. Its mid continental position acts as a barrier between the northern cold front
and the southern subtropical warm belt, and prevents the monsoons from crossing over its heights
into Tibet. This formidable attribute of the Himalaya forces the winds to lose their moisture in its fold
which subsequently becomes a source of water to a multitude of rivers held sacred by devotees since
the dawn of human civilization. As the legend goes, king Bhagiratha intensely prayed to Shri Ganga to
appear on Earth. Impressed by his prayers She agreed to appear from the cosmic world, but the Earth
could not bear Her fierce flow upon which Bhagiratha prayed to Shiva to seek His blessings. Pleased
by his prayer Shiva held the weight of Shri Ganga in His matted hair, but she got entangled and thus
could not reach the Mother Earth. On this, Bhagirath once again prayed and Shiva was pleased to
liberate Shri Ganga from His matted hair, after which Shri Ganga branched out on the Earth in ten
different directions. The various branches finally converged at Devaprayag to form Shri Ganga for
Her joy-giving journey to the Bay of Bengal. Shri Ganga with the highest BOD (Biological Oxygen
Demand) value among all the rivers is called as the life-line of India in general and northern plains in
particular. Shri Ganga symbolizes the 'shudha ichha' aspect at the subtle level on which various
pilgrimage centres are located at the gross level on ground.
Enlightenment on Himalayas by Shri Mataji not only provides strength to the contemporary
scientific thought on the evolution of the Himalaya, but also gives a deeper meaning to the spiritual
realm for the seekers. In Sahaja parlance, Himalaya corresponds to the Sahasrara Chakra.
Shri Mataji once revealed "The Himalayas are the Sahasrara that Mother Earth has created for you. This
Sahasrara is to be worshipped. This Sahasrara is very great. I don't know if you can see vibrations emitting from
it. I am completely engulfed by their vibrations that I cannot see anything else. There are only vibrations and
vibrations, nothing else. Those who are residing here are swimming in vibrations and seem like fish swimming in
the ocean of vibrations. You cannot distinguish one from the other.I cannot describe in words the splendour of the
beautiful vibrations that are spread here. This is indeed the blessing of the Himalayas.
Foremost we recognize the ocean as our Guru. The ocean is our Father. When the ocean leaves behind all the dirt
of the World that is dumped into it and rises in the sky as clouds, then it becomes completely pure and beautiful.
Floating in this state it reaches the feet of the Himalayas and spreads as 'Him. The word 'dhaula' means
'completely pure', nirmal. Dhar means 'range." (The mountain range is called Dhauladhar.) Like these pure
ranges in the Himalayas, they are also to be found in our brain, where they support an opening of the Sahasrara.
After this I cannot describe any further but I can say this, that the auspicious opportunity has come today of this
connection; try to avail it and go to its depth. Think that before it, we are a dot of sand, an innocent child, There is

 giving folds to her saree, you can say. Now, when that moment started, the saree gave waves of vibrations in such
a way that at certain points it rose up to a point becoming like Shri Ganesha. And it was, to begin with, of flat,
again the same type.
But then, still more folds started coming up, much later, when human brain started developing its ego. So the
whole of that land was pushed tép and another land joined it in such a manner that it formed an apex. The super-
ego was pushed in and was brought to the climax. That synchronizes with the human brain, because the whole
universe is represented in our body as well. Now, the central axis of the Mother Earth acted as the spinal cord. By
this happening in the Himalayas, again there was a big push on to all the mountains which were to be created as
Shri Ganesha and they got into their final forms. And the apex was created.
So, the Mother Earth as Gauri created all these Ganeshas. At the other end of these ranges, must be the highest
mountain because it is pushed the most. Mount Blane should be higher than this. You see, when they pushed on
the right hand side more the ego went expressing in Mount Blanc, you see for example. And on the other side, it
was created another Ganesha at other end near Darjeeling. So Shri Ganesha was expressed even in Darjeeling,
you get the same kind of redness on that. I have seen another Shri Ganesha created in Delphi where they say is
the Nabhi of the Mother Earth.
and
Also when Shri Shiva Lingam is created, along with Himalayas there is a Shri Ganesha created, as in
Amarnath, where a drop of water falls on a particular area and creates the lingam. Plus that, another drop falls
on another side and creates Shri Ganesha exactly like the face. Now the ocean is the father, and the Mother Earth
is your Mother. But when the Mother Earth becomes a Mountain, She is called as the Father. The reason is: She
at that height can catch the Father on Top of Her head, as snow or as rain.
That is how a mother becomes the father, and so She can perform the complete function of a father and a
Mother. In that state only, Gauri the Daughter of the Mountains comceived Shri Ganesha without the help of the
Father, immaculate. The purity of snow is hundred percent, and that covers the Mother Earth, gives the
formation of innocence. All the filth and dirt goes into the ocean is clearified by the sun, which is also Shri
Ganesha, and is brought on the top of the hills and mountains to cover it". (From souvenir released on the eve
of Shri Ganesh Puja, Lucknow, 1999)
To praise the divinity of himalayas is beyond words. Abode of Gods, the Himalaya has been
frequented by sages and saints, philosophers and philanthropists, ascetics and mystics, travelers and
tourists, pilgrims and pastors since the immemorial past. And now, for the realized souls - the Sahaja
Yogis, the Himalaya is held in high esteem for its significant correspondence with the Sahasrara of the
world.
Shiva, who embodies the destroyer aspect of the trinity of God (Generation, Organization,
Destruction) is said to reside at Mt Kailash. According to tradition Shiva wears bones of the dead as
decoration and smears himself in ash - signifying the burning of the lower desires. The higher
significance of the destroyer aspect is that he cuts the bonds of the ego, liberating the Atma within
from the darkness of ignorance. Coincident with this theme of death is the presence of two large
hollows on Mt Kailash so that from one particular angle, the ice covered dome of Kailash appears as a
skull with two large eyeholes peering out from beneath the skull-like dome.

 The
The mystical tradition in Judaism is known
as Kabbala and its major text is the Sefer
ha-Zohar, parts of which began to
circulate in manuscript in the northern part
of the Iberian peninsula of western Europe
(now known as Spain) in the late 1280s.
The Zohar presents itself as an ancient
rabbinic midrash (or priestly
) on the
Pentateuch (a collection of ancient Jewish texts), authored by Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai (known
as Rashbi), a rabbi' of the second century CE, who, along with his circle of mystics, is the main
protagonist of the Zohar. Written in Aramaic, the language of these early Jewish mystics, the
Zohar has many characteristic words and phrases that betray its medieval European origin
(having in fact been written by Rabbi Moses de Leon). Thus the Zohar is most likely the
collective product of a Kabbalistic fraternity in Gerona in Castile, in northern Spain, drawing on
previous, secret, teachings of the earlier Rabbi Isaac the Blind (c.1160-c.1236) and his circle in
now southern France). Many of the concepts presented in the Zohar are also to be
found in earlier texts. The term Sefirot, for instance, originated in the Sefer Yetzira, where it is
refered to as ten ideal numbers that functioned, along with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew
alphabet, as the 'building blocks' of the universe. The concept of the ten Sefirot appeared in other
Sefer ha-Zohar
Com m entary
Provence
earlier texts, notably Rabbi Azriel of Gerona's Explanation of the Ten Sefirot.
There is an apparent similarity that the diagramatic representation of the ten Sefirot has with the
diagramatic representation of the chakras in the yogic tradition of India. It has become
fashionable in certain parts of new age spirituality to make such a comparison, and, as a Google
search reveals, there are a number of web pages that purport to directly compare Sefirot to
chakras. Leaving aside the obvious, namely that there are ten Sefirot and, usually, only seven
chakras. There are obvious dangers in such a superficial comparison of two profound mystical
traditions, and the direct comparison of Sefirot to chakras is not attempted here. These two
mystical traditions do however have some similarities worthy of note.
One fruitful comparison is that of the Shechina with the Kundalini, both of whom are refered to
as feminine, and both of whom grant or deny access to the aspirant to higher spiritual knowledge.
The Gate
In the Zohar 1:103b, it is written:
Come and see. There is opening within opening, rung upon rung,
through which the glory of the blessed Holy One becomes known.
Opening of the tent [Genesis 18:1] is the opening of Righteousness,
as it is said: Open for me gates of righteousness. [Psalm 118:19]
Rabbi: Chief Religious official of a Synagogue who performs ritualistic, educational and other functions.
14
 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-16.txt 
 This is the first opening to enter;
Through this opening all other supernal
openings come into view.
Whoever attains this attains all other
openings,
for all abide in Her [the Shechina]
In this text, the phrase 'the gates of righteousness'
Keter
is understood to refer to the Shechina.
For a yogi, the Kundalini also resides at the first
opening, as described in a song in the Marathi
language, attributed to Namdev, and dating most
probably from the late thirteenth century CE,
coincidentally the date of the Zohar:
in the beginning

Binah

I, Vishnudas nama

Here the 'ant' is yogic code for the Kundalini, and
the 'mouth of the triple river' refers to the
entrance to the three nadis, or channels, which
Yesod
connect the chakras.
The thirteenth century Marathi saint Jnaneshwara
has provided the clearest exposition of Kundalini
awakening in the sixth chapter of his commentary
on the Bhagavadgita, popularly known as the
Jnaneshwari. In the midst of a technical, but
nevertheless awesome, description of the ascent
of the Kundalini, he comments that
Shekhinah
This Kundalini is the mother of the world,
15
 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-17.txt 
 RIRANI
who illumines the self
and gives shade to the sprouted seed of the universe.
It is the embodiment of the formless Brahman,
the cask of Lord Shiva, the main spring of the sacred syllable Om.
In this we are reminded of the Zoharic relationship of the Shechina to the male aspect of the Divine.
Gates and palaces
Let us consider another text from the Zohar, from 1:7b:
Open for me gates of righteousness [Psalm 118:19],
this is the gate of the Lord [ibid].
This is certain because if one does not enter through this gate,
m one cannot gain entry to the worlds.
It is like an exalted King who is high, hidden and concealed,
and who has made gates for himself, one upon the other
and at the end of all the gates he had made one particular gate
with a number of locks, a number of doors, and a number of palaces.
In some respects this reminds the present writer of the Spanish Christian mystic, Teresa of Avila (1515-
1582), who, in her book, The Interior Castle, depicts the soul entering a castle and proceeding through
the seven heavenly mansions containing numerous rooms so as to encounter God at its centre. In First
Mansions, chapter one, Teresa outlines for the reader (originally her fellow nuns) her first thoughts:
I began to think of the soul as if it were a castle made of a single
Diamond or of very clear crystal, in which there are many rooms,
just as in Heaven there are many mansions.
In her conclusion, Teresa notes that
Although I have spoken here only of seven Mansions, yet in each
there are comprised many more, both above and below and around,
with lovely gardens and fountains and things so delectable that
you
will want to lose yourselves in praise of the great God Who created it
in His image and likeness.
Also in her conclusion, Teresa cautions the reader against over-confidence:
It is true that, however strong you may think yourselves, you cannot
Enter all the Mansions by your own efforts: the Lord of the Castle
Himself must admit you to them. So, if you meet with any resistance,
I advise you not to make any effort to get in, for if you do you will
displease Him so much that He will never admit you.
As in the Zoharic text quoted earlier, here we have an 'exalted King' (Lord of the Castle) who decides
who will or will not enter his domain.
WOH
A probable reason for this similarity between Teresa's Interior Castle and the earlier Zohar lies in the
16 2
 2005_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_I.pdf-page-18.txt 
 Jewish ancestry of Teresa. Whilst Teresa attempted to keep her past secret, she had been brought up in
a Jewish converso family whose ancestors had in earlier times felt it prudent to convert to Christianity.
Additionally we need to note that both Teresa and her confidant, Juan de la Cruz, were living in Avila,
the Spanish town where Moses de Leon had compiled the Zohar less than three hundred years earlier.
Teresa's seven mansions can also be compared to the seven stages of meditation in Abraham
Abulafia's ectastic Kabbalah, and to the seven palaces of the earlier Merkabah tradition.
The origin of the Zoharic use of gates and palaces is most probably to be found in the texts of the earlier
Jewish mystical tradition, the Merkabah. As a modern historian has noted, "the world of Merkabah
mysticism is one of the most dazzling of the mystical worlds. It is a realm of fantastic heavenly beings,
of bizarre magical names, and of occult interactions between spirit and matter. In it, closed gates to
celestial palaces are opened by long, incomprehensible incantations, and the dangers which rise up
against man as he enters the realm of the supernatural are met with seals of truth." The period of
Merkabah mysticism extends from as early as the first century BCE and continues until the tenth
century CE, and whilst its texts have only survived in fragments and are still being studied by
historians, its influence is surely in the Zohar. In the Pirkei Heikhalot, which has only survived in a
fragment which includes chapters 15 to 29, the mystic is given detailed instructions for passing
through the gates of seven successive palaces, each of which are guarded by wrathful angels who can
refuse entry if the mystic does not give the correct 'password'.
Six reflected in the seventh
The concept of seven as a sacred number is common throughout many religions and mythologies, and
is also
present in the Zohar and in earlier Jewish mystical texts such as those of the Merkabah tradition
in which the mystic enters seven successive palaces as noted above. The notion of six being reflected in
the seventh is encountered less so. In the texts of the Kabbala, such as the Zohar, the six male aspects (or
sons), namely Hesed (greatness), Gevurah or Din (judgement), Tiferet (beauty), Hod (majesty), Nesah
(endurance), and Yesod (foundation), are reflected in the seventh, the female Shechina (or daughter).
Whilst the male/female aspect of the relationship of the six to the seventh would seem to be unique to
the Kabbala, there are other mystical traditions where six powers are found integrated in the seventh.
In Kundalini yoga, the qualities of the six main chakras, namely Mooladhara (innocence, wisdom),
Swadisthana (creativity), Nabhi (sustenance, satisfaction), Anahat (love, joy), Vishuddhi (collective
consciousness, communication), Agnya (forgiveness), are integrated in the seventh, the Sahasrara.
Classical Kundalini yoga texts also described the ascent of the Kundalini through the six chakras to the
seventh, the Sahasrara, known as the thousand-petalled lotus. Thus, in the ninth stanza of the
Saundarya-Lahari (The Ocean of beauty) the great Indian yogi-saint, Sankara, addresses the Devi, the
Goddess:
Thou art diverting Thyself, in secrecy with Thy Lord, in the thousand-
petalled lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in the Muladhara,

सभी सहजयोगी भाई बहन हैं। आपस में पूर्ण तरह से
प्रेम रखना चाहिए। किसी से ज्यादा, किसी से कम प्रेम

नही है । मैं इस चीज से तंग आ चुकी हूँ। सहजयोग के
लिए यह बहुत ही धातक है । हम सब एक है और एक ही

सहजयोग तत्क्षण घटित होता है, लेकिन उसे श्रद्धा
और समर्पण से ही बरकरार रखा जा सकता है, यह सत्य जिसने जाना वही सचा सहजयोगी है।
सहजयोग के कारण जो अगम्य था वह गम्य हुआ है, जो सुक्ष्म था वह दृश्य हुआ है । पर सहजयोगी विशेषकर हिन्दुस्तान के, बहुत कम
गहरे उतरे है।
* लंदन मे सहजयोग का कार्य बहुत जोरो से शुरू है और धीरें-धीरे जमीन मे सहजयोग की जड़ें फैल रही है। पर जड़ों को ही कठीनाई
होती है। अगर जमीन की मिट्टी बहुत ही नरम एवं गीली होगी तो जड़ें धरती में आसानी से प्रवेश करेंगी, मगर ऐसी जड़ें कमजोर होती है
और उनकी जमीन पर पकड़ मजबूत नही होती, तथा वह ऊँचे और महान वृक्ष को आधार देने योग्य नही रहती। इसलिए सहजयोग की
नींव कठीन तथा पथरीली जमीन
चाहिए की धरती के साथ झगड़ना पडता है। यह झगड़ना भी अपने हित मे ही होता है। इसी झगड़े से जड़ें सभी परिस्थिती जान कर,
अत्यंत गहरी उतरती है और धरती में सहज योग के वृक्ष की गहन नींब बिठा रही होती है। यह सहजयोगीयों का अंतर्योग पाने के लिए
महामाया का प्रसाद ही समझना चाहिए। परिस्थिती के साथ झगडा करना हमारा कर्तव्य है, मगर परिस्थिती बहुत उत्तम तथा चारों
दिशाओं से नरम होना उपयोगी नही है, यह सत्य भी सभी सहजयोगीयों को जानना जरूरी है।
सहजयोग में हर चीज प्रार्थना में माँगी जाए तो जरूर प्राप्त होती है ।
सहजयोग में शरणागति मे ही अर्पण शक्ति का प्रभाव है, इसी से आपकी प्रगति होती है।
पर ही बिठाई जाती है। पहले यह काम थोडा कठीन और असाध्य लगता है। फिर भी यह जान लेना
सत्य को खोजने वाले बहुत ही कम होते है, फिर भी सत्य सभी को बताना चाहिए। जिन्हे इसका बोध होगा वह जरूर इसे ग्रहण करेंगे,
और नही हुआ तो भी सत्य की शक्ति व्यर्थ नही जाएगी। यह चैतन्य स्वरूपा है, यह लहरीयों के माध्यम से सभी लोगों को अवश्य ही
स्पर्श करेगी। अगर इसका परिणाम मृत वस्तु पर होता है तो यह तो मानव जाति है जो अधिक जागृत है। धीरे-धीरे सहजयोग मानव
को भवसागर से पार करा रहा है।

To further enhance the symbolic mysticism of the mountain as a sacred place, two lakes are situated at
the base of the mountain. The higher lake, Manasarovar, is round like the sun, and a lower lake,
Rakastal is the shape of the crescent moon. The two lakes represent the solar and the lunar forces
respectively. The inner consciousness of man (the solar force) is often compared to the Manasarovar
lake. When the thoughts of the mind are stilled, the reflection of the higher Bouddhic mind and Atmic
awareness is seen. Manas mean Mind in Sanskrit. The crescent lake, Rakastal partakes of the lunar or
dark forces and this is reflected in the name which comes from Rakshasas or demons; beings who are
totally under the sway of the lower desires and impulses (i.e. lunar forces).
A visit to the vibrant Himalaya and reverent feeling for the holy river Shri Ganga is an

It would be possible to compare the final lotus (Sahasrara) with the Keter (or crown Sefirot) but, as
commented above, direct comparison of the chakras and the Sefirot seems to the present writer to
be unnecessary, and demeaning to both mystical traditions.

Harmenszoon van Rijn
(1606 1669 A.D.)

Leiden (Holland) on July

she was a woman of extreme

was present when Joseph and
Mary brought their son Jesus
to the Temple. St Anna
immediately recognised Jesus
as the long-awaited Messiah.
Arising out ofa core beliefthat all things descend from
God and are not to be scorned, he had a admiration for
life in its totality. All humans were worthy of his
esteem, even beggars and outcasts. Unlike the
detached observer, Rembrandt identified with the
dispossessed and demonstrated a sincere sympathy for
the afflicted.

 Christ is presented to the people, half-naked, his hands
m chains, surrounded by soldiers, high on the balcony
of the Roman governor Pilate's palace. Pontius Pilate,
bearing a turban and sceptre, points to him uttering the
words 'Ecce homo' ('Ecce homo' is Latin for 'Behold,
the man'). The story of Pontius Pilate is told in various
books of the Bible. The 'Ecce homo' episode is from
John 19:5). - Behold the Man! Standing slightly behind
Christ and Pilate is Barabbas, an infamous murderer.
The throng stands before the balcony. Pilate lets the
people decide which of the two prisoners may go
The crowd, influenced by the high priests, choose to
set Barabbas free; Jesus will be crucified.
Rembrandt shows Anna deeply absorbed in studying
the Bible. The light comes from behind her, touching
on her Oriental-looking head-dress stitched with gold
thread, and her red velvet eloak and shining directly on
the Bible with her hand pointing to the Hebrew letters.
Rembrandt painted this old worman's hand with great
care, with its thin wrinkled skin and clearly visible
veins. Anna's face, however, is hidden in shadow
free.
Rambrant often painted people. Many people wanted
their portraits painted by Rambrant probably because
the painting of people he did looked almost real.
Another one of his talents was his ability to paint light,
dark and people's shadow so well. He also painted
himself. That is why during his life Rembrandt painted
over 100 self portraits. He did around 600 paintings,
300 etchings and 1,400 drawings.
Some of the other famous paintings most of which are
at display at Rijks meuseum, Amsterdam are The Night
Watch(1642).
The Three Crosses(1653)
Rembrandt's greatest and most dramatie print is the
Three Crosses, a work which has all the power of a
painting. It shows the deepest point of Christ's Philosopher in Meditation (1632), The Music Party

darkness. When they comne to Calvary where they
crucified him, the malefactors stand on the right hand
and one on the left. Jesus then said, "Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do." The people
stood beholding the light that descended on the entire
country. The light focuses on Christ, the two murderers
who were crucified beside him and the crowd round
about.

Shri Mataji Mentions Rembrandt in a Talk:
"That (Ego) is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art. We can't have Rembrandt, we
can't. Poor Rembrandt himself must have suffered
a lot, you know Gauguin suffered a lot, all these
artists suffered a lot, even Michaelangelo suffered
a lot. Not only monetarily but otherwise, criticise,
criticise, criticise, so I think people have given up.
I met an artist who had done lots of artwork and I
said why don't you show me? He said 'No I don't
want to show you. It's created for myself. I said I
would like to see. I saw, it was beautiful, very
beautiful, I said why don't you show. He said no
use, people will just criticise, I do it for my own
pleasure; they'll just spoil the whole joy of my
creation.

 Encounter
With Love
[A report published in a magazine called Ziereus,
May 1983. The uriter, nho met Shri Mataji before
she visited the U.S.A, received his self-realization
during the intervien.]
The aim was to talk to Shri Mataji Nirmala
Devi about her forthcoming North
American tour. What happened was
something that is only now, a week later,
starting to make sense. I telephoned the
number Shri Mataji's followers in New York had given me, and found myself, an hour later, knocking on the
carved door of a five storied terraced house in London's classy Knightsbridge district. The door was opened
by a young Indian who ushered me into a reception room as ornate and rich as a jewel box. Furniture
pink crystal
covered with rose silk, tables inlaid with ivory, carved and gilded wooden screens, pale
chandeliers. I heard Shri Mataji before I saw her. "How are you? How is America?"
Then the lady appeared. Short, plump, with long dark hair falling free and a smile that chips away all
defences. Tea was ordered and I was asked to sit down. Before I could get the first question into gear
Mataji asked, "Do you know what the chakras are?" Imumbled something about subtle energy centres along the
spine.
Shri
"That's right," she said, and tapped the base of her neck with her index finger. "This one is called the Visbuddbi. In
the universe the VVishuddhi is North America. Australia is the lowest chakra, the Mooladhara. India is the Kundalini, ahich
can link all the chakras together."She traced a line from the base of the spine to the top of her head, "But America
is the Vishuddhi, isn't it? Such an important chakra." Shri Mataji then touched the red spot on her forehead.
"This chakra," she said, "is the Agnya. It is presided over by Lord Jesus Christ, isn't it? The Agnya is forgiveness. It shows
that the spirit cannot be destroyed, just as Christ could not be destroyed, but rose again, didn't he?" Shri Mataji quietly
contemplated the risen Christ for a moment, then jabbed her fingers towards the base of her neck again.
"The Vishuddhi, its presiding deity, you could say, is Lord Krishna. The Vishuddhi stands for diplomacy, sweetness, self-
esteem, communication and collectivity-like
Did you know that? - a realized soul. You have had many great men. Roosevelt now-be said, Poverty anywbere is a threat to
prosperity everynhere'. So clear. Amerita is so great. It is protected by Lord Krishna's discus."
Shri Mataji held up the index finger of her right hand and twirled it and I swear I could see a bright glittering
disc whirling round. "Ar long as that discus is there," she said, "America can never be invaded.

your Abraham Lincoln. He stood for collectivity. Abraham Lincoln was a saint-
"Conld that pratection ever be withdraw?" I asked. Shri Mataji shrugged expressively, and raised her eyebrows
high. "Perhaps," she said. "If the land of diplomacy stopped being diplomatic, the land of communications communicated
bad things, the land of sweetness turned bitter, then yes. Perbaps Lord Krishna might witháraw the protection."Suddenly she
laughed. "On ry tour I shall tell everybody bow to stop that from happening." I asked Shri Mataji if she was visiting
North America just to sound such a warning, "There are seekers of money, seekers after power, seekers of physical
gratification," she replied, "and then there are people who have done all those things and are now seeking the truth, seeking

 their spirit, seeking God. There are many, many seekers of truth in America. Great, great seekers. Oh so great. I uant to meet
them. Show them how they can get what they have been looking for, probably since ages, lifetimes even, their self-realization.
"What is that exactly?" I hadn't yet asked one question from my carefully prepared list. Tea arrived.
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the spellbinding visionary, turned into Mrs. C.P. Srivastava, the attentive hostess.
Did I have the right amount of sugar and milk? Would I have a biscuit? (Which turned out to be a cookie.)
"Self-realization," said Shri Mataji, "is the yoga, the Hnion. The joining of the microcosm to the macrocosm, you could say. The
raising of the energy in each of us called Kundalini. There is no English word for it. You should invent one. There is a good job
for you. Invent a good English word for Kundalini. The linking of that energy with the all-pervading energy of God, that is
what self-realization is."
"What exactly does it do?" I felt a fool at the naivety of the question. "It brings abont a change in awareness. You feel it
as a cool breeze, cool vibrations, you could say, on the top of the head and on the hands. It is an actnal happening! Not self-
certification. Not saying 'I am born again!" or 'I am this or that!" You actually become! If you desire self-realization and you get
it, then you become collectively conscious, truly sweet and truly diplomatic. A true blue American, you could say." And the
joyous laughter flowed into every corner of the room. I asked Shri Mataji if she was the only one who could
grant this self-realization. "Oh no," came the reply, "once you have it you ean pass it on to others.""Butit all seems to
start from you,"I said. "Why you?" Shri Mataji's face became serious. "As far as I knon," she said, "I am the
only one who can do it en-masse. Once, in India, 6000 villagers got it at the same time. But if there is someone else nho can do it,
then I am only too happy to retire. I am sixty years old." (At times she looks half that.) "I am happily married. I bave a
beautiful house as you can see. It would be good to settle down and stop all this travelling around all the time. But until I find
someone else who can do it, then it is up to me, isn't it? To meet the seekers and let them know bow to gain this gift that is their
own, their right, this Union with God."
"Could I receive this gift?" I asked. Shri Mataji's eyes danced, "Put your hand above your bead," she said. I did as I was
told. There was a faint, oh so faint coolness on my hand. I looked round to see if there could be a draught
coming from anywhere, but there was no air conditioning and the windows were closed. "You feel it?" I
nodded, tentatively. "That is the beginning. Perbaps while you were drinking your tea you said to yourself, Td like that
experience,' and,"Shri Mataji snapped her fingers, "you gat it. It can only happen if you desire it. Give me your band."
She took my hand and started tracing a cross over the palm. "You think too much," she said. "Your mind is husy,
bury, busy, thinking away." From that moment on it wasn't. It was hardly thinking at all. "Too much thinking can
give people diabetes. It is not sugar that causes diabetes, it's thinking. We can cure diabetes. After realization. And this nen
thing AIDS, after realization we can cure that too. With realization you become your own gru. You can diagnose your own
problems and those of others, and you can cure them. Anybody with their realization and the desire to develop their spirit, can
cure and be cured." At this point a wave of most pleasant well-being swept over me. It wasn't a trance or a
hypnotic state (I've experienced those)- it was a fecling of deep peace.
I regretted my next question. It caused the smile to fade from Shri Mataji's face, "How much are you going to
charge Americans for this experience?" "Itis part of evolution," she replied. "It is a gift of love from God, nho is the ocean of
love, the ocean af compassion. Hon can you pay for that? God does not understand money. How can you pay for your evolution?
Did you pay to stand up un two legs? Anyway, why would I want money? I come from a wealthby family. My husband is
Secretary General of the United Nations International Maritime Organization bere in London. I do not need money. I do not
accept money." Shri Mataji let go of my händ and smiled. "Better now?" she asked. I nodded. "That is because

America," she said. "I want to meet them."Now, almost a week later, when I sit down quietly, that sense of peace
and relaxed happiness returns.I am hoping it won't go away!
