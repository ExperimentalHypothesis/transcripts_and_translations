Shri Gauri Puja, Auckland (New Zealand), 8 April 1991.

Gauri is the mother of Shri Ganesha and She produced Shri Ganesha because She was having a bath, and to protect Her chastity She created Shri Ganesha. 
In the same way, Kundalini is the Gauri and we have got Ganesha sitting in the Mooladhara Chakra. So we have Mooladhara as the abode of the Gauri, of Kundalini, and the protection of the Kundalini is done by Shri Ganesha. As you know, Shri Ganesha is the deity which is for our innocence. Only Shri Ganesha could be there in that position because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after all the excretory functions, and it is Shri Ganesha only who can really stay there without getting dirty by the surroundings - He is so pure; He is so innocent - while the Kundalini is the virgin, the virgin mother of Shri Ganesha. People have started talking against Mary by saying that there was something wrong, ''How could a virgin get a child?'' because we do not understand it is God and in the area of God anything is possible. They're above all these things and they can create anything and in any way Ganesha had to be born out of a virgin because He was so pure. 
So Kundalini has to be supported by Shri Ganesh. If Shri Ganesha is weak, then Kundalini cannot be supported. Shri Ganesha has to support her in the awakening part first of all. When the kundalini is getting awakened, Shri Ganesha stops all the functions that it has to perform. All the functions are stopped so that - you must have seen, I sit for nine hours, ten hours sometimes - I don't get up, because all functions of Shri Ganesha, everything stops when the Kundalini is rising. She is fully supported and looked after by Shri Ganesha. The Kundalini is the energy that you know which gives you your ascent, but it is a virgin energy. It's a energy that is detached; it doesn't get attached to any center, to any function, only one function it has to do, is to slowly and steadily pass through all these centers, nourish them, give them whatever they like, whatever they want, whatever they can bear, and slowly and steadily open the Sahasrara. She is coiled up in three and a half coils it has a mathematical significance why three and a half, why she is - I think in My book I have described about her. But though she's a virgin energy, still she is so wise, so sensible, so loving and so caring that when she rises She doesn't give any complications to you. She doesn't even make you feel that she's rising - in some people she does, when the people are not normal, some obstruction is there; then you do feel it, but normally you do not even feel how she is rising. 
She goes up in a way automatically, supported by the whole mechanism when she rises from one center to another center. The lower center first opens for her to enter in and then it augments, it closes down so that it can keep the kundalini in its place, then it goes higher, there again till it pierces through Sahasrara, this ascending of Kundalini goes on. This is what is raj yoga that is not artificial, something outside, but the spontaneous working of the mechanism is raj yoga As I always say that when you start the motorcar all the mechanism starts working by itself, but by just moving the wheel you cannot make the car move. In the same way, when the kundalini is rising, She rises spontaneously and passes through these six centers. That time she also at Vishuddhi, she opens the Vishuddhi and when she emerges through it at that time the tongue is a little bit pulled in just to keep the flow on. This reaction is called as khecheri so when people are very deeply in meditation, those who have achieved great heights in meditation, they find suddenly they get into khecheri situation, or we call as mudra in that state as if some nectar starts flowing from your palette. If you move your tongue upward like that you'll feel the cool coming down your tongue: try that. 
Now this, you don't have to do when you are in deep meditative state. It starts cooling down your tongue slowly as automatically you get into khecheri state. As far as Sahaja yogis are concerned today, there are very few who really feel that way. The reason is you do not meditate. We do not pay attention to our realization, also. We talk about it quite a lot, in the West specially we discuss it more than to do something about it. We have to meditate every day, just like washing our hands or just like cleaning our teeth, we have to in the morning-time meditate and also in the evening we have to meditate. We have to meditate both the times otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow. Just to think that we are realized souls you do not become. This cleansing has to be done every day, every day in and out. And this is why none of the experiences which are described are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga and people ask, ''Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khecheri?'' Because your attention is not also there where it should have been. 
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner that it is working of the kundalini is facilitated. The chakras are cleansed out and ultimately you are in a state of meditation. It is not a question of how to go into meditation, but is the question how to be in meditation all the time. So as you know that kundalini, when she reaches the Agnya Chakra and when She opens Agnya chakra, then you can be in thoughtless awareness, then you don't think - thinking just stops. You watch everything, just watch, but you do not get involved into what you are watching, but you just watch and that watching itself gives you the growth within. Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil order during earthquake: it won't grow. When the earthquake stops, everything becomes quiet, everything is peaceful, then only the tree can grow. In the same way, our growth can only take place if we are peaceful within ourselves. 
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider and rising higher and higher, first thing is we must have peace within ourselves, but this peace is possible if you can make really peace with others. If you cannot make peace with others who are in Sahaja Yoga, who are in the collective, if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise. That is why collectivity is so important. Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open, and without collectivity you cannot have the growth of your spirituality. It's the growth of the spirituality as they say the tree of life is upside down and the roots are in the brain, and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain, as we water the roots. Then it starts growing downward and that's how you start expanding. When you start expanding, then you touch the depth of your divinity, and once you have touched the depths of your divinity then you start working it out in such a manner that people will know that you are yoginis, you are people of higher realm, you have something great. It is not how many times you read something, it's not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga, it's not even how many times you just go on reciting names, but how many times from your heart your pure desire is to ascend. 
If this pure desire got upon you, then the first thing and the last thing you'll do is to meditate - you can't do without it. Even if you try, you can't do without it. If you will sleep without meditating, you'll think ''Oh, I have not meditated'' - not out of guilt, but ''l have missed something, I have missed something.'' That should happen to us. So this power of Gauri has to be respected because she's our mother; she's our individual mother, she has given us second birth. She is the one who knows all about us; she's so gentle, so kind, how she slowly rises. She doesn't give us trouble; she takes all the trouble of penetrating through these centers and she gives us a second birth, because she understands everything - she knows everything; she organizes everything; she brings forth all the beauty that you are. Once you start developing that beauty within yourself, then you'll be surprised how powerful you are, that all these things are of the same nature is the truth that you discover, is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy. You don't have to think that joy is separate, truth is different, beauty is different. Because we are not yet at that point we just take one facet, but once we reach that point then the whole thing seems to be one. There is no differentiation at all. It's all one. Many facets of a diamond but it's one diamond and that diamond is your self, your spirit. 
So today is a very great day, we have to thank our mother, our kundalini, the Gauri for giving us realization and to know that we have to every time awaken Her, every time we have to expand Her, and every time to worship Her so that we always keep our realization intact and keep our ascent intact. It is this ascent which is going to transform all the human beings. So you have to pray to Her that keep us pure, make us pure, She purifies you, Her job is to purify your chakras, so please purify us, make our hearts clean, our minds clean, everything clean and ultimately keep our connection forever and everlasting so that we feel this beautiful power of God's love flowing through us. For that, whatever is necessary he will do, will be very much in the collective, will sacrifice anything and also will try to be very sensible, will try to spread Sahaja Yoga, because when you spread Sahaja Yoga like a tree then the depth will grow also. But it has to be done with the same beauty as the awakening of the kundalini. She has not troubled you, she has not given any problems to you, so from that one has to learn that we have to behave in a manner the way kundalini is so gentle, so sweet, so nice, so effective and she brings our life to some meaning. 
She completes the meaning of our life, she completes our desires and she takes us to the point where we start seeing the whole thing, the whole universe as one, all human beings as one. She gives us collective consciousness. All this work is done by Kundalini alone. Of course, if she does not go to any chakras and does not awaken any deity, we cannot even have the fruits of those chakras being awakened. 
So it is all her work, all her ascent, all her understanding and wisdom which has given us this beautiful state that we call ourselves as yogis. So I would request you all to pay attention to your Kundalini, try to raise her all the time, see that you get your vibrations, also see that not only that you get your vibrations all right but also for others you have a different attitude - do not criticize others, do not say anything about how wrong they are but just see how right they are and what good they are capable of. She is a virgin and still so wise. In the same way we have to be very wise, very sensible. We cannot afford to waste our time now because we have to save the whole world, is our responsibility. If we do not now work out even our own chakras, we cannot help anyone. So first of all we must work out our own chakras and then we can help the whole world. It's not something like a cult or an organization where you just say, ''I belong to this cult or this organization. So it's all right, I'll be saved by God.'' That's not promised in Sahaja Yoga. There's nothing like a ticket to Heaven. It has to be worked out; you have to work it out and work it out with full understanding as to what is this kundalini is and how she works. May God bless you!
