Shri Gauri Puja, Auckland (New Zealand), 8 April 1991.

Gauri is the mother of Shri Ganesha and She produced Shri Ganesha because She was having a bath, and to protect Her chastity She created Shri Ganesha.
In the same way, Kundalini is the Gauri and we have got Ganesha sitting in the Mooladhara Chakra. So we have Mooladhara as the abode of the Gauri, of Kundalini, and the protection of the Kundalini is done by Shri Ganesha. As you know, Shri Ganesha is the deity which is for our innocence. Only Shri Ganesha could be there in that position because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after all the excretory functions, and it is Shri Ganesha only who can really stay there without getting dirty by the surroundings - He is so pure; He is so innocent - while the Kundalini is the virgin, the virgin mother of Shri Ganesha. People have started talking against Mary by saying that there was something wrong, ''How could a virgin get a child?'' because we do not understand it is God and in the area of God anything is possible. They're above all these things and they can create anything and in any way Ganesha had to be born out of a virgin because He was so pure.
So Kundalini has to be supported by Shri Ganesh. If Shri Ganesha is weak, then Kundalini cannot be supported. Shri Ganesha has to support her in the awakening part first of all. When the Kundalini is getting awakened, Shri Ganesha stops all the functions that it has to perform. All the functions are stopped so that - you must have seen, I sit for nine hours, ten hours sometimes - I don't get up, because all functions of Shri Ganesha, everything stops when the Kundalini is rising. She is fully supported and looked after by Shri Ganesha. The Kundalini is the energy that you know which gives you your ascent, but it is a virgin energy. It's a energy that is detached; it doesn't get attached to any centre, to any function, only one function it has to do, is to slowly and steadily pass through all these centres, nourish them, give them whatever they like, whatever they want, whatever they can bear, and slowly and steadily open the Sahastrara. She is coiled up in three and a half coils it has a mathematical significance why three and a half, why she is - I think in My book I have described about her. But though she's a virgin energy, still she is so wise, so sensible, so loving and so caring that when she rises She doesn't give any complications to you. She doesn't even make you feel that she's rising - in some people she does, when the people are not normal, some obstruction is there; then you do feel it, but normally you do not even feel how she is rising.
She goes up in a way automatically, supported by the whole mechanism when she rises from one centre to another centre. The lower centre first opens for her to enter in and then it augments, it closes down so that it can keep the Kundalini in its place, then it goes higher, there again till it pierces through Sahastrara, this ascending of Kundalini goes on. This is what is raj yoga that is not artificial, something outside, but the spontaneous working of the mechanism is raj yoga As I always say that when you start the motorcar all the mechanism starts working by itself, but by just moving the wheel you cannot make the car move. In the same way, when the Kundalini is rising, She rises spontaneously and passes through these six centres. That time she also at Vishuddhi, she opens the Vishuddhi and when she emerges through it at that time the tongue is a little bit pulled in just to keep the flow on. This reaction is called as khecheri so when people are very deeply in meditation, those who have achieved great heights in meditation, they find suddenly they get into khecheri situation, or we call as mudra in that state as if some nectar starts flowing from your palette. If you move your tongue upward like that you'll feel the cool coming down your tongue: try that.
Now this, you don't have to do when you are in deep meditative state. It starts cooling down your tongue slowly as automatically you get into khecheri state. As far as Sahaja yogis are concerned today, there are very few who really feel that way. The reason is you do not meditate. We do not pay attention to our realization, also. We talk about it quite a lot, in the West specially we discuss it more than to do something about it. We have to meditate every day, just like washing our hands or just like cleaning our teeth, we have to in the morning-time meditate and also in the evening we have to meditate. We have to meditate both the times otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow. Just to think that we are realized souls you do not become. This cleansing has to be done every day, every day in and out. And this is why none of the experiences which are described are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga and people ask, ''Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khecheri?'' Because your attention is not also there where it should have been.
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated. The chakras are cleansed out and ultimately you are in a state of meditation. It is not a question of how to go into meditation, but is the question how to be in meditation all the time. So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches the Agya Chakra and when She opens Agya chakra, then you can be in thoughtless awareness, then you don't think - thinking just stops. You watch everything, just watch, but you do not get involved into what you are watching, but you just watch and that watching itself gives you the growth within. Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil order during earthquake: it won't grow. When the earthquake stops, everything becomes quiet, everything is peaceful, then only the tree can grow. In the same way, our growth can only take place if we are peaceful within ourselves.
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider and rising higher and higher, first thing is we must have peace within ourselves, but this peace is possible if you can make really peace with others. If you cannot make peace with others who are in Sahaja Yoga, who are in the collective, if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise. That is why collectivity is so important. Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open, and without collectivity you cannot have the growth of your spirituality. It's the growth of the spirituality as they say the tree of life is upside down and the roots are in the brain, and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain, as we water the roots. Then it starts growing downward and that's how you start expanding. When you start expanding, then you touch the depth of your divinity, and once you have touched the depths of your divinity then you start working it out in such a manner that people will know that you are yoginis, you are people of higher realm, you have something great. It is not how many times you read something, it's not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga, it's not even how many times you just go on reciting names, but how many times from your heart your pure desire is to ascend.
If this pure desire got upon you, then the first thing and the last thing you'll do is to meditate - you can't do without it. Even if you try, you can't do without it. If you will sleep without meditating, you'll think ''Oh, I have not meditated'' - not out of guilt, but ''l have missed something, I have missed something.'' That should happen to us. So this power of Gauri has to be respected because she's our mother; she's our individual mother, she has given us second birth. She is the one who knows all about us; she's so gentle, so kind, how she slowly rises. She doesn't give us trouble; she takes all the trouble of penetrating through these centres and she gives us a second birth, because she understands everything - she knows everything; she organizes everything; she brings forth all the beauty that you are. Once you start developing that beauty within yourself, then you'll be surprised how powerful you are, that all these things are of the same nature is the truth that you discover, is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy. You don't have to think that joy is separate, truth is different, beauty is different. Because we are not yet at that point we just take one facet, but once we reach that point then the whole thing seems to be one. There is no differentiation at all. It's all one. Many facets of a diamond but it's one diamond and that diamond is your self, your spirit.
So today is a very great day, we have to thank our mother, our Kundalini, the Gauri for giving us realization and to know that we have to every time awaken Her, every time we have to expand Her, and every time to worship Her so that we always keep our realization intact and keep our ascent intact. It is this ascent which is going to transform all the human beings. So you have to pray to Her that keep us pure, make us pure, She purifies you, Her job is to purify your chakras, so please purify us, make our hearts clean, our minds clean, everything clean and ultimately keep our connection forever and everlasting so that we feel this beautiful power of God's love flowing through us. For that, whatever is necessary he will do, will be very much in the collective, will sacrifice anything and also will try to be very sensible, will try to spread Sahaja Yoga, because when you spread Sahaja Yoga like a tree then the depth will grow also. But it has to be done with the same beauty as the awakening of the Kundalini. She has not troubled you, she has not given any problems to you, so from that one has to learn that we have to behave in a manner the way Kundalini is so gentle, so sweet, so nice, so effective and she brings our life to some meaning.
She completes the meaning of our life, she completes our desires and she takes us to the point where we start seeing the whole thing, the whole universe as one, all human beings as one. She gives us collective consciousness. All this work is done by Kundalini alone. Of course, if she does not go to any chakras and does not awaken any deity, we cannot even have the fruits of those chakras being awakened.
So it is all her work, all her ascent, all her understanding and wisdom which has given us this beautiful state that we call ourselves as yogis. So I would request you all to pay attention to your Kundalini, try to raise her all the time, see that you get your vibrations, also see that not only that you get your vibrations all right but also for others you have a different attitude - do not criticize others, do not say anything about how wrong they are but just see how right they are and what good they are capable of. She is a virgin and still so wise. In the same way we have to be very wise, very sensible. We cannot afford to waste our time now because we have to save the whole world, is our responsibility. If we do not now work out even our own chakras, we cannot help anyone. So first of all we must work out our own chakras and then we can help the whole world. It's not something like a cult or an organization where you just say, ''I belong to this cult or this organization. So it's all right, I'll be saved by God.'' That's not promised in Sahaja Yoga. There's nothing like a ticket to Heaven. It has to be worked out; you have to work it out and work it out with full understanding as to what is this Kundalini is and how she works.

May God bless you!

Now I would have to have fourteen ladies – if there are not let’s see, but at least eight ladies, if you can have, manage. How many married ladies are there? ...

Yogi: Married ladies how many are? One, two, three, four, five….

Shri Mataji: Ah-ah, five.

35:16
She will put the line for you, then you start.

38:34
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, do we have to sing “Hasata Ali”?]

I think sing one, one in between somewhere there, because she’s still tying little bit. Let’s sing this one, “Adi Ma” – “Adi Ma”. Now come along now.

39:53
From My purse just give the...

41:50
Now, what’s that ….

43:33
May God bless you. ….

44:24
The other way round, I think. That’s all right. All right? It’s all right. ….

46:38
Will you read the Horoscope for them?….

47:52
[Horoscope is read]

Yogi: The Moksha Grantha. The Moksha karaka planet should be in the ninth Dharma Sthana.

Shri Mataji: Dharma Sthana.

Yogi: Showing that the Dharma that is established within, is not outwardly, and is the truthfulness. This Sthana gives the capacity to go all alone.

Lagna being aspected by Jupiter and Lagnesh aspected by Jupiter is an added strength, giving one the capacity to become the World Guru. Jagat-Guru. [Shri Mataji laughs].

Venus or Mercury is the ruling planet in all the cases. [If] both are there it is excellent because both the planets are Dnyan-karak.

Shri Mataji: Dnyanakaraka – means they give you the knowledge, knowledge on your central nervous system as well as knowledge of your mental level.

Yogi: It may be noted that these combinations are present in the horoscopes of all the above-mentioned personalities in different quantums. In the case of Shri Mataji…

Shri Mataji: “Different quantum”: quantums ansha. Ansha means “part”, is quantum.

Yogi: In the case of Shri Mataji all these combinations are present in full strength. Number four combination, number five combination is particularly observed to be very strong in the case of Shri Mataji as compared to the others.

Four is… oh, the World Guru, Jagat-Guru, and five is the…. Oh, the planet which has the, as Mother said, the mental knowledge and the knowledge on the central nervous system. So those two are strongest and stronger in Shri Mataji than in any other of the named and dead (personalities)…

Shri Mataji: And also it’s complete. They are saying that they’re ansha Avatara.

That means they had part of it.

But in My case is all complete.

I mean, it’s really fantastic I must say (Shri Mataji laughs, yogis laugh)

Yogi: Shri Mataji is born in Gemini Langa…

Shri Mataji: Lagna.

Yogi: Whose Lord is Mercury, with Moon in Bharani…

Shri Mataji: Bharani.

Yogi: … Nakshatra, whose Lord is Venus, which means She is under the ruling aspect of Mercury and Venus. Shri Mataji is born with thirteen years and eleven months… what does that mean?

Shri Mataji: That cycle, is the cycle.

Yogi: Oh, cycle is thirteen years and eleven months. The balance of Venus dasha, meaning pleasant and happy childhood.

Oh, I see, this is… oh, very strong: that is, now we are talking about the balance, the pleasant and happy childhood is from 1923 to 1937. That’s the first thirteen-year cycle.

Then there’s a six-year cycle, or six-year period, thereafter the sun’s period of six years, indicates tapa-period, a spiritual and political activity of intense nature. That would be the time, Shri Mother, of the independence?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Yogi: The next is a period of ten years. Thereafter the Moon period - that was the Sun period of six years, they had the Moon period of ten years indicating clear headedness and deep contemplation of mass enlightenment, political and spiritual activity. That was until 1953.

They had next period of seven years, the Mars period of seven years, from 1953 to 1960, indicating travelling and a lot of changes.

Then Rahu’s period of eighteen years – Rahu is a Divine planet giver of intricate knowledge of Brahma, inner soul searching and the search for the en masse awakening.

This claims that between 1960 and 1978 Shri Mataji discovered all the aspects…

Shri Mataji: Yes, and the founder of, she’s given, what was that, the fifth May. But just now he’s just given the time cycle.

Yogi: Now is a period of sixteen years which goes through to 1994. The Jupiter period of sixteen years – spreading Sahaja Yoga, the Guru principle throughout the world.

Thereafter Saturn will govern for nineteen years. That’s from 1994 to nineteen years where it will spread Sahaja Yoga in the whole world, Saturn means the masses, the Virata, and Shri Mataji will witness Kalki-Mercury power manifesting through the whole world.

According to the birth horoscope, the Sahaja horoscope of the 5th/5th/1970 – that’s the horoscope taken on the 1st Sahasrara Day – Jupiter passed through Libra…

Shri Mataji: Fifth, fifth – Sahasrara Day.

Yogi: Jupiter will again pass through Libra in 1993, and Sahaj will blossom in the entire world. That’s the next cycle from 1970 - next one is 1993.

Shri Mataji is born with Rahu Nakshatra in Ascendant - Mercury (Gemini), and Moon in Bharani (Venus) Nakshatra..

Shri Mataji: That means the planet.

Yogi: Clearly indicates that Rahu is films, TV, radio which is ether principle, Vishuddhi, and Venus means music, film personalities, artists can help;

Mercury is the ruling planet of the present-day politics, Sahaj can enter through present political system – ah… that’s interesting Mother…

Shri Mataji: That’s what I’m thinking.

Yogi: … that’s interesting, the stars of the present political system and the stars of Shri Mataji are together at this particular time.

In the early Indian politics, at the time of Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, the ruling planet was Venus, thereafter the ruling planet of Indian politics has been Mercury, as all the important political events took place on Wednesday.

Shri Mataji: I was born also on Wednesday! That’s why the Mercury is so strong.

Yogi: It may be noted here that Shri Mataji has both Venus and Mercury as Her ruling planets, thus She has full sway of the past and the future of Indian politics.

Shri Mataji: (She laughs) Can you beat that! I mean, always Indian politics, see.

Yogi: This is further confirmed from the horoscope of 5/5/1970, that was the first Sahasrara Day horoscope, which is almost identical with Shri Mataji’s horoscope.

Gajkesari…

Shri Mataji: Gaja Kesari.

Yogi: Gaja Kesari. With Jupiter in Libra, Saturn aspecting Sahaja Lagna, Sun exalted … from this we see that on the 15th August 1990, Sun’s period is up to this, 15th August 1996, the period of 1990 to 1996, during which all great souls will be attracted to Sahaja Yoga and have their inner spiritual ascent, purification, and then, on the 15th/8th 1996, for ten years, Moon’s Dasa is starting. Then it goes to the muses…

Shri Mataji: Masses, masses.

Yogi: Oh, masses. And the work is completed up the 15th August 2006.

Jai Shri Mataji!

Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji: The last bit, you should read that, that’s very important. It’s over?

Yogi: There’s just one paragraph at the bottom. Shri Mataji: Yes, continue, continue with it.

Yogi: There’s two diagrams here and one showing how closely associated Shri Mataji’s horoscope is with the horoscope of the first Sahasrara Day. Three planets … all that, the relationship in between the planets which is exaltation and there’s another aspect to these planets which is double strength. Venus is totally free from any malefic aspects, giving Her the name of…Nish…

Shri Mataji: Nishkalanka – Kalki. Nishkalanka. Nishkalanka avatara. Means the incarnation of Nishkalanka.

Yogi: Ah. What Divine combination, just pointing to us Who She is. I bow to the Almighty God Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, who is the Nishkalanka Avatara, about which our Puranas are speaking from centuries.

Shri Mataji does namasté.

Shri Mataji: You will have to make copies of this. I think is better that everybody should have his own copy. Whenever they will need it, then they can read it. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)

Yogi: To get the big picture.
