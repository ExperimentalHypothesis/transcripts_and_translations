Sahastrara Puja. Le Raincy (France), 5 May 1982.

&nbsp;

It is a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last centre in the great primordial being, was done on the 5th of May 1970. It is the greatest event of all the Spiritual happenings of the universe. It was done with very great care and great adjustments. It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked out in the heavens. It is your fortune and God's love, that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Without this happening, there could not have been the possibility of giving mass realisation to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to have given such a mass awakening would not have been possible. As you know, in the Sahastrara there are the seats of the seven main chakras. There are 1.000 nadis or as they call it flames, and they all have each 16,000 powers, Every nadi deals with a particular type of person; and with the permutations and combinations of all these nadis, human beings are looked after. As soon as the Sahasrara was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous chaitanya [vibrations], and there was tremendous light in the sky, and the whole thing came on this earth as if a torrential rain or a waterfall, with such a tremendous force, as if I was unaware and got stupefied. The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned and I became completely silent at this grandeur. I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace, and the furnace was very silent but burning appearance it had, as if you heat up some metal and it has many colours. In the same way, the Kundalini showed up like a huge furnace, which is like a tunnel, where you see these plants you have for coal burning that create electricity; and it stretched like a telescope one after another, it came out Shoot! Shoot! Shoot - like that. Then the deities came and sat on their seats, on their golden seats, and then they lifted the whole of the head, like a big dome, and opened it, and then this torrential rain completely drenched me, and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy. It was like an artist seeing his own creation. Fulfilled, I felt the joy of great fulfillment. After coming out of this beautiful experience, I looked around and saw human beings so blind and I became absolutely silent, and desired that I should get the cups to fill the nectar, not all stones.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sahastrara is the most beautiful part of your being. It is a big lotus with a thousand petals of different colors appearing like inflated flames. It is a thing that has been seen by many people, but to see it pour that torrential rain was like these flames becoming a fountain, a fountain of color, fountain of fragrance; when you think of a flower pouring its color and its fragrance around.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People have written very little about Sahastrara, because whatever they have seen is from outside, and it is not possible for them to see from inside. Even if you reach from inside and the whole Sahastrara is not opened out, you cannot see its beauty; because when it is closed, the whole of it, you just pass through an aperture and get out of it. But just imagine a huge big thousand petaled lotus, and you are sitting inside on the corona and looking at all those petals, all very beautifully colored, and fragrant, and pulsating with the bliss of joy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To remain on that position, is the ideal position, but then after the silence you are filled with tremendous compassion and love, and you are drawn out to people who haven't yet known what is having eyes. And then you try to put your attention to the Sahastrara of millions of people; and then you start seeing the problems that exist in the Sahastrara. And even if you desire to open the Sahastrara, it is a very difficult thing, because the channeling of the Divine to human beings, has to be done through human beings. The power may be with you, but it has to be channeled through human beings.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All my life I have not known many realised souls. How to get them? How to work it out? So I started looking out for people, and I met an old lady of 70 years, and she was very perturbed about something very gross and when she came to see me she felt very peaceful. Her Sahastrara was very worn out, and in my company, she would think of something else, not the Spirit; and her brain would be covered with clouds and darkness. Again and again, I had to enlighten it; but she did not get her realisation. Most of the people who came to me in the beginning, came to me for getting cured, This capacity I had since childhood. And I could also give realisation, to a few people before, but they had to be very earnest, artha. I did not meet anyone of that quality because I was not living in the forest; I was living as a normal human being among other normal human beings; and they were not that earnest, that artha, and I had to do this work among them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How to talk to them about the real world that exists, and the false in which they live ? One lady, the first one who got realisation just came to see me because she was possessed with the idea of seeking. She sought and it worked with her. It was not the happiest day, because she was one of those who got individually realised. With this great happening many should get it at a time. We had a program in Bordi in 1970, and there, first one gentleman got realisation in the evening.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Next day there were negative forces acting in the morning time, and they started talking of favoritism. I could see in the atmosphere the vibrations were going wrong. In the evening I took up a very strong, firm attitude; I was in a great fury, I never went into such a fury before and I lashed all of them. Surprisingly, twelve of them got realisation, That was the greatest moment. Then many got it one by one. Three of them traveling back got realisation in the train, suddenly they felt vibrations. So the mass evolution started.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sahastrara is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the techniques of the Divine. Now there are two techniques, the techniques of the Divine, and the techniques you follow. You cannot act as divine, but you can use the divine power and manoeuvre it. For example, the Divine looks after all the universal happenings. Every minute st particle is controlled by the Divine. When your Sahastrara opens out, and your kundalini touches the fontanelle bone, a sort of igniting force is ready in your Sahastrara; and as soon as the fontanelle bone area opens up in the brahmarandra, the grace of the Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nadis get enlightened. Not all of them, but quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries That's how you get your enlightenment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So many things happen because of your seven centres being in the Sahastrara. With the light you see their relative positions. I mean you do not see, but it works in your conscious mind. Your conscious mind feels that integration within you. The rationality, that is separated from the heart, becomes one with the heart. It becomes one with your attention. Wherever your attention goes you act in a collective way. All the activities of your attention are blessed. Your attention itself is effective. Your attention is very important, your desires are even more important, because it is such an integrated thing, your desires and your attention become one. Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire, and your attention goes to whatever is emitting Spiritual power. The priorities change very fast. Those people who are primitive and not evolved, may not find that happening; but those who are mentally developed, they have an attention which they try to test. They first want to see how to raise the Kundalini.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

That want to see that is logical. For a balanced person there is no questioning at all, we have some people like that amongst us. They just became and never questioned. They just settled down. They are innocent, they are intelligent, above all they are Spiritual; but whatever may be the defects in the qualities, they can be corrected through your Sahastrara. First of all you have to put down your ego; because if ego is there it presses the Sahastrara. Also the super-ego must be reduced because it also presses the Sahastrara, and gives pain. So keep the Sahastrara in its healthy state. One has to realise, one's priorities have to change, Some people take time so they have to make deliberate efforts. There are many books, if you read them, they suggest anti-God activities. An enlightened Sahastrara does not like it. It closes back. That's like a poison; it does not like any poisonous thought to come in the mind. If you go about with the poison, then again it closes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the same way the people who are hot temper 1, very much hot tempered, and all the other problems of the ego, if they try to suppress the Sahastrara, also the Sahastrara starts closing. Those people who have had conditioning from wrong gurus, and wrong books, from wrong parents may be, from a wrong country, from a wrong livelihood, also do not allow the Sahastrara to grow in it's healthy way.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It is only the Sahastrara which has to grow, not the Spirit. The more sensitive the Sahastrara is, the more it receives the Spiritual qualities of the Spirit. Actually, the peace is felt in the Sahastrara. The bliss is also felt in the Sahastrara, because that is the brain, and the brain is the epitome of the nervous system, the central nervous system, or consciousness itself. So merely by opening Sahastrara, the work is not done. We have to have more and more channels, who will act as the nadis with their different powers, and who can work it out in a proper systematic manner. But those people who indulge into wasteful habits after realisation, obstruct the flow of the nadis, and are really very harmful for the Virata. Such people should really leave Sahaja Yoga and spare; or such people should be asked to leave and we should severe ail relations with such people who stand against such a great work of the Divine.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The one who wants to develop on Sahastrara should know, he should not develop with bad company, but always have the company of other sahaja yogis, He should not have his own holidays, or own time, but most of the time, he should spend in the company of other sahaja yogis.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After the Sahastrara, when you are above the Sahastrara, you can see that it is very important that all these nadis must be kept together, and all the centres and all the deities must be kept intact and integrated. This can be done even with conscious effort, by watching yourself, your thoughts. You start seeing your ego and your superego. You will be able to see how you cheat yourself and are dishonest with yourself. How you are convincing yourself, you are very good. How you are enjoying an ego trip ?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits, so all other things must drop out. All misidentifications must be dropped out. One can do it through the conscious mind, as I said, one should really correct oneself, because after realisation whatever you desire becomes part of the divine desire, whatever you do becomes part of the divine action; so one has to remember that with conscious effort we can really find ourselves and see if we are really honest about it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If we are honest one can see that collectivity is the only way to expand the Sahastrara. For that tolerance is needed, wisdom is needed, and the stature is needed of a prophet, which you are, and you should talk like a prophet. actually, you have to educate yourself. How does a prophet speak ? This is not insincere or acting, because now you are awakened. When you are not awakened, whatever you do like this, is artificial. Sahastrara is the controlling, guiding and evolving force, and so to keep it absolutely ready for growth and expansion, one has to watch one's own growth. Never justify your wrong doings; If you start justifying, you are thinking about that. We have no time to think about it. We have to think of others, because others are also in your brain; and when you start thinking of others, talking to them about their resurrection, your Sahastrara will definitely increase in its size and its subtlety. The sensitivity also will increase, The depth will also come. It is just like a tree, when it grows, its roots spread So you have to come out of your shells and spread your wings. All your small things of mind must be given up. You must live like a huge big personality, which has to give support, guidance, help and awakening to thousands.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If this Sahastrara Day in France, establishes a new dynamism in this country, I am sure that it will catch up with the thought of the people. It will resound in their minds, their unconscious will transmit it into their beings, and they will start thinking afresh. Now, new breakthroughs will take place, and people will start going towards truth logically. They will come to right conclusions and drop out all that is wasteful and useless.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sahastrara is the throne for the Spirit; and the bigger is the king, the bigger is the throne The way you treat your Spirit, is expressed in your Sahastrara, and this is how you can give realisation, and then you can become a subtle being.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Through your conscious effort, you can enter the beings of others and raise their Kundalini. Enlightening the Sahastrara also gives you a new light to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle happenings in the atmosphere. When you start developing higher and higher, you can see the vibrations as lights around you.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You may not have any interest in many things, but will become amazed how you become master of everything; as if your brain is manifesting what you desire. And this is what Krishna promised, who is actually the Virata; so you become the master of your brain, because actually the Spirit is master of the brain.

&nbsp;

The more you bring your Spirit into your attention, the more the Sahastrara increases in size; its light expands and you become a more powerful Sahaja Yogi. This is the greatest thing for God Almighty to say, "See, this has happened." So for the time being he may postpone his anger and wrath; so he can forgive human beings for their mistakes, their obstinacy and childish pranks. Let the man rise to see the glory and the greatness of his Father. Let him also get the power to bear the compassion of God. Let him also see the Sahastrara develop to such dimension, that he can execute the workings of the divine through his conscious mind.

&nbsp;

The Sahastrara has one mantra, that is “Nirmala”, meaning one should keep it clean, pure and immaculate. That is what is your job. Just try to keep it pure and clean, and this will definitely mark another step, another accelerated jump into a new dimension of many more human beings.

&nbsp;

It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris today, so that the whole world's attention should be on Paris, on France. This country which has been cursed and neglected by all the deities, because human beings went really very wrong. Let all the deities be settled down in this country, because this is the attention, and whatever attention we pay, is reported to us through Sahastrara. So may the Sahastrara of France be opened out and the attention of France should be guided to the Spirit, and eternal life. It is a very important country and that is why I decided to celebrate Sahastrara day here. The responsibility of French Sahaja Yogis is much greater. They have to change their methods and styles. They have to become kind, gentle and healthy people; but at the same time, should be very strong Sahaja Yogis, so that when others see them, they should see the superiority in them. Before the Sahastrara day, we had such a successful session. I am very happy about it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now I bless all the centres in the world, who have prayed or are praying; to give them a very developed Sahastrara, an enlightened one, that they may expand so much, so they may become one with the whole.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

May God Bless Them
