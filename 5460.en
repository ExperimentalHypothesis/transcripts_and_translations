Description of Kundalini.	Delhi (India), 1976.

 If any one of you wants to put any question and get some ideas clearified , Shri
Mataji is prepared to reply

Q :- --- your attention has to be free at the time of realisation when the kundalini
is awakened all your attention is extracted within and the kundalini while rising
takes it on its head or on her head and brings the attention outside the sahasrara.
So at that time, best thing is to let ?loose yourself , just sit down , watch it,
what is happening instead of putting any effort. It is an effortless ? That helps
you the best. So, no mantra is to be chanted. After realisation you must know what
mantra is to be chanted where.  There is a big science about it. So the complete
tantra, what you called ‘kundalini’ is there. But, so you must know how to
handle it, what mantra is to be said, what is to be said and which chakra lacks a
??? thing. It is , you have to master it. And there are many here in Delhi also who
have mastered it. So it is not difficult. Anybody can master it. It is not
difficult. Even a little girl like Pradnya has mastered the Kundalini. She can do it
! Why not you people can do it . So, you have to just find out what are the chakras
which are defective and you can treat it also. 

Just now those who got realisation, you got your realisation no doubt so you would
go and meet those people D2, 88 , pandara road, and there you go and they will guide
you,  what is to done in future. And go deep into it and make yourself established
and be a master of Kundalini. All that is ???(guhya guhya taram)  I have told them.
And you will get all the knowledge about it. 

Q that’s a very good apt question. He asks universal consciousness... it is all
deliberate..... why it is kept in human being.....
now in the growth of evolution , from a samll amoeba , you come to a human stage. At
the human stage, articulation takes place. Means the shell of the egg is developed.
For the egg to develop, the shell is developed. You are made limited. Through the
growth of your ego and superego within yourself, your brahmarandra is closed down,
your “talu” is closed down, and your left to yourself. I will tel l you in an
analogy by which you will understand. For eg., If I have to use this microphone, it
is developed somewhere, away from the mains, then again it is brought and put to the
mains. In the same way human being is cut from the mains. He is given “I“ness 
from him to develop his instrument, his awareness; in such a manner that when he
receives the mains, he can communicate, he could understand, and for that
development, articulation was done. Just like an egg is made in a shell for
protection and for its growth and then when the cheek is ready in that shell, it is
broken by the mother ; here just like I break the brahmarandra, is the same, its
that

Q : - 
Now the idea of atmadhyan/atmagyan/atmadnyan if it is read in the books, it is
rather difficult. But, what happens with the rise of kundalini, first of all when we
enter into that infinit thing, some people rise like a steep very strong jet like
speed they get. But some of them rise very slowly and then we can see the stages
into which they rise. The first thing that happens  is that you become thoughtless.
But you are aware. First stage that happens is thoughtless awareness. Thoughtless
awareness means that you start watching the thoughts. That means you are separated
from yourself. Like you were in water and now you jumped on to the boat and you see
the water now so that you are separated. This is what happens those who have gradual
ascent. You become thoughtlessly aware, which we call in the hatha yoga as “
asampragyat samadhi” . Ofcourse according to them its a very higher stage. But,
you become thoughtlessly aware and the vibrations start flowing from you hand by
which you know something is  flowing. You start getting cool breeze from me and you
start getting cool breeze from other sahaja yogis and when you give it to others you
find it is flowing. This we can say is the first thing that happens. That means you
become collectively conscious of another personality. This  is the first thing that
happens. The second stage in which you jump is “Nirvikalpa” , means in that
stage you become doctor. Then you dont ask me questions. There are some people who
are like that here. So they have no questions, they have felt it, they known it . I
say in a different way. Supposing I give you a thousand rupees. Now if you do not
spend it how would you know what is the value of that. You will say what you have
given thousand, what is there you have given just given us vibrations. But once you
start using it, then you will see tremendous powers you have got. And the powers of
so called, i mean what you call ordinary vibrations , some people think like that .
It is so easily available , it happens to you so sahaja, that you do not understand
the value of it. But once you start using them and then you see the tremendous thing
that you have got it . It gives the bliss and the joy that flows into you. You come
into the stage of doubtless awareness. The third one I would say is the complete
selfrealisation is established. Now, in the thoughtless awareness, as you can say
that, supposing now as you have got justice sitting here. So  then he is a justice,
he has certain powers. In the same way when you rise to the thoughtless awareness
you have certain powers by which you can give awakening to people. Just move hand
and the kundalini of the people will move, Is surprise. But it does. You can move
the hand and you can feel the kundalini, you can feel the kundalini of other
persons,  you can feel the chakras of other persons; only with thoughtless
awareness. But with doubtless awareness you start giving them realisation.
Absolutely , just like that. And with higher self realisation what happens? That you
just become a sakshi. No problem. You never catch anything. You see, normally what
happens when a person come to  you, you place your hand for that person and you feel
it, ohhh disgusting, this fellow is burning. You dont like it because you see the
chakras of that person is burning on your fingers. Then you can catch the catch
also. Then yo get involved into it. But later on when you are completely
selfrealised you become a completely “nirlepa”. You do not catch any such things
and you rise into the realm where you are into complete “vaigragya” , you are
just flowing, you are into sakshi sate. But after this three stages is the stage of
GOD’s realisation in which you start controlling the nature completely. Some
people, ofcourse through hatha yoga try to control nature , but that is just upside
down. We start it from top and go down. First of all let us go to the divine stage
and then come down . Then establish into the, if we control the nature, see if you
can control the  say rain , you can control the sun. all this can be done. But, that
is you see you loose interest in doing it. But automatically you can do it. For
example when I was going to see one maharaj like that and he was very evolved soul
and he has got it through you see thousands of years of tapascharya. Say he was
sitting down there and the rain was pouring down and he didn’t want me to get
drenched and so he was trying to control rain. I know he can control rain. But the
rain was pouring. And he didn’t know what to do and was upset with himself. When I
went up he said did you want to kill my ego that you didn’t allow the rain to
stop. I said, it was not so. You see, I am the mother. So told him very sweetly that
I know that you have bought a saree for me and if I were not drenched then you will
not give me the saree. So I just wanted the rain to. So you see thats how the little
ego that was there that I am controlling the rain ??. So it is the thing that happen
automatically. You do not want to do it but it just happens. You just dont want to
bother about these things but it just happens. Wherever you are it just happens. It
is that state where you start rising into the GOD’s realisation. When you are in 
GOD’s realisation, you are sitting here or any where you can see things, you can
influence people, you can help them, you can do lot of things Sitting down anywhere.
You may sit in Himalayas.  There are people like that who are sitting in the
Himalayas are helping you ?  . So they can do it and they are one. For eg. This
gentlemen about whom I am telling you, who is a very great saint, he saw at my time,
at the time of my birth, everything that happened. He knows about my past lives for
thousands of years. He recognises me. There is another one who came to see my from
Amarnath who is three hundred years old. He is also of the same type and he also
said all those things. But you see , their style/side? Is different and your
side/style is different. You are people made like Ganesha, they are not. They still
catch. You dont know. That why that three hundred year old man , had some pa        tches
on his body.  I said what have you done Nagnath Baba. How you got it ? He said I got
it from one horrible fellow he touched me. I said alright I will take it out for
you. Then he said what about you? I said not me. I a mother , mother do not get it.
Mother never catches because of children. In the same way you people also dont
catch. There are some people here who have cured cancer. They have never caught
anything from anybody. So you see , you have much more power because you are people
who are simple? , you are like Shri Ganesha. Because Shri Ganesha has much more
power than any one of the deities there are . Because you are so simple, so
dedicated to mother 

Q – (inaudible )
We are living in this world because we have to become instrument in the hands of
GOD. He wants to use us. You see we have to be a good instrument in his hand. For
eg. An artist has a brush . Why is the brush there? For the artist to use the brush.
Now, I will tell you a very sweet story about it. Once Radhaji was very jealous of
murli, that Shri Krishna was carrying on his lips. So she asks murli, what is your
speciality that you are all the time near the lips of my lord. So, she said, my
speciality is that I am no special. I have become a hollow person. The melody is
going through me. He is using me just as an instrument and I laugh at the people
when they say you have been slave. I say I am just watching like a sakshi, like a
witness. And if I stand anywhere in between then his melody will be spoilt. This is
the concept?. And if you don’t achieve this concept? then all this recklessness
comes to .. problems comes, goes this way that way, then your parasympathetic is
taxed. When your parasympathetic is taxed, then you start thinking what are we to
do, where are we to jump now, whole petrol is being exhausted in this body.  But,
once you open out to the mains, it starts pouring into you. And you are absolutely
relaxed. 

Q – (inaudible )
It just takes a second if  you are ready.  For every ordinary person it really takes
a second. Then it rises in a second it rises. But what happens is kundlaini is your
mother. So now supposing your mother is coming to see you and you are sick. So first
of all what she will do is that your sickness is removed. Then she sees that you are
mentally upset . So she looks after your mental problems. Then she sees that you are
wrongly placed in ?chakra. So she corrects you and ultimately she blesses you. If
somebody is in ? ? who has got a good health, of normal health, he is living a
normal married life, he is the best seeker. And there are some who have got it like
just that. But some people are ? , some trouble, because they have gone through
various ordeals of life. They have been tortured, they have got some mental problem
the mother has to cure them. You see, you cannot say that when this tree is going to
sprout , ??? ,. Can you say that at this day the flowers will appear. Can you say
that at this day all fruits will be coming. No, you cannot. There is no time for
living process. It works itself. It works for the organism, that is yourself, and
then it clicks itself. That is what is sahaja.

Q- asking for realisation. 
Q – long question
Right for any body who is not realised .. that should be the question. You see arond


be the question. You see around such a lot of  ?. Now he has asked two questions. He has confusion two questions. The first one of misery, the second one about over population. So first I will answer the first question of misery. You say that there? Is misery. I accept it that there are misery. And miseries are there because of human beings themselves. Because they haven’t got the divine within themselves. If they have divine they will not dominate, they will not bear domination, they will be different people. But, we can say one thing, How will reduce the miseries of people when you are not realized. See, I have told you that there are seven chakras in the humanbeing. When they are awakened what happens? Let us see. First of all you physical problems are solved, your health improves, you lead a very healthy life. You will be amazed and in Sahaja yoga, nobody dies before he is seventy 70 years of age. He lives a very very healthy life to begin with. First misery of physical life is over. Not only that physically live good life, but he makes others physically alright. He makes them physically fit without taking a single pai (paisa/rupees) from them. The vibrations that flow from him, he cures them and the other person gets alright. Now as I have told you that there are people here who have treated so many people, have cured so many people without taking a single pai. Because this love is flowing and that’s yourselves?.  So the physical problem is solved. 

Then the second problem is your emotional problem. The person suffers emotionally. They become emotionally disturbed, sometimes there are possessions. They come into it from their subconscious mind and there are problems from with the emotional side. Now, after ralisation people become sakshi in the sense that emotionally they do not get involved with the things that they do not feel disturbed about it but they see the things?. I will give you a very concrete example. I had a grandchild, first grandchild born in my family. This child was born with a heart which was all time pulmonary ???; which cannot be cured. Because it’s a basic problem and I knew about it the day she was born. But I was silent and on the 5th day I said to the doctor and said you must take her under the x-ray. I see what is the thing. Doctor was surprise he said why u think so. Such a little child should not be taken to a x-ray. I said you take. I took her secretly and showed her. They found that the enlargement of the heart. Now, when I came home I didn’t tell my daughter, I didn’t tell my husband who was to come from Delhi. When he came back, with very great introduction I told him. Immediately he fainted. He is a very healthy man and, I mean that way emotionally he is supposed to be a very sensitive person, very balanced, but, he fainted. We told this to the father of the child he fainted. My daughter fainted. They couldn’t bear. I took the child to the hospital. I admitted him in the hospital because the doctor said they had to do other tests. Then we had to take the child to America and I knew that the child was going to die. But I feel alright. If they feel that the child has to be taken, I take. None of them could take. They couldn’t take the child. I took there. The so called miserable people are actually are overdoing things. By which they are spoiling every body’s life and making themselves miserable also. The way they talk of misery actually are so exaggerating. I do not know if they are really that miserable the way they talk about ? and they cannot do anything about it because until and unless you are separated from the problem, how are you going to solve it? You see, you have to be separated. Unless and until you are a doctor, you are not going to operate. Supposing you are a patient, how are you going to operate yourself? So the doctor in you must be separated. This is what the sahaja yoga does. Because you are the patient and you are the doctor that’s why the whole thing is more exaggerated. If you find any doctor being sick, he will be the worst patient. I have seen , that in practice it is so. That’s why who are miserable are much more miserable than they are really because they themselves do not know how to cure it. So the emotional problem is solved. Now, then there is another problem which we face all the time is of our “dharma” of our dignity. How to be dignified , how to be ourselves? The simple problem. And that is solved. No doubt. Because there you find the divine flowing through you. You really become a dynamic personality apart from that. I have to tell you another thing which happened to another people who are sahaja yogis. That is the your Laxmi awaken. Now you know what is Laxmi. Such a person cannot become a beggar. Cannot ! A sahaja yogi cannot become a beggar because his Laxmi is awaken. He is looked after. See there is God almighty looking after you! This is the sin against GOD that all the time you are so insecured. The one who has created you, the one who is looking after you is going to look after you everywhere. But you want to run after other things. You want to do smuggling, you want to do all kind of things, you want to cut each other’s throat and then you want to see that you are happy and all. And then you have to depend on him ??? . And the person who is realized, he is like a badshah, he is the king. He is always the king. He doesn’t bother. I can tell you about myself. I feel no dearth of money or dearth of anything. Never ! If you ask me I can sleep on the ground. Perhaps I was born in very rich family and my husband is quiet rich, but if you ask me I can live anywhere. I can do without food for days together. It isn’t matter of all the time people talk about eating eating. How much do you eat. There is no need to eat such a lot. That’s why some people are poor. Some people will such a lot that there are some people who are poor. But automatically your attention on food and all drops out. You just get it. If you get it well and good you don’t get it well and good. This morning I had no breakfast and all that . ?? Because if your body is filled with energy you don’t need. Actually this is the first time the energy is filling you all. Then you give vibrations. In Rahuri (Maharashtra state) there called university there they have experimented. In the University for first time they have experimented in agriculture university. With these vibrations the grapes, wheat is 10 ten times more They have found that the fruits that came out of it were beautiful and, they are so tasty and so ?ful. They found that the cow was given vibrated water , Indian cow, started giving milk like an Australian cow. But I cannot write a guarantee check for you. That is one thing. So, all the miseries so called will drop out.
 
Now the over population problem. That’s very interesting. I tell you what it is. Why there is such a overpopulation. You see, the congenial atmosphere for the rakshashas and for the bhoots, giving chance for the bhoots to come as human beings. Once this congenial atmosphere will disappear, only the saintly will come and they are not so many. And they will not need so many. I think ? willnot need much. With very little he will be satisfied. He is a badshah Its only the mental attitude that makes him bhikari. Otherwise we are not. We are very rich people.
 
Q ask for realisation
