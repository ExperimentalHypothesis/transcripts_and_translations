奉獻和虔誠的重要 

英國倫敦1982年8月6日

今天,我要告訴你們,在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡奉獻的重要,以及霎哈嘉瑜伽士應有的虔誠。

當我們很靠近一座山的時候,我們看不見這座山的大部分,不知道身處如此龐大體積的東西,我們不知道面前這偉大。這是一種幻相在起作用,令人們不能在思維層面上知道他們為何會存在,知道他們身處哪裡、他們找到了什麼、自覺是什麼、自覺的高度有多少、他們需要走多遠、他們為何會被揀選、他們的生命有何意義、他們昇進了多少、他們能夠明白到什麼程度。所有這些事情都超越了人們所能理解的範圍,人們因而感震驚。當人得到自覺之後,他不知道究竟有什麼事情會發生在自己身上。

因此,唯有當你們明白怎樣奉獻,才會明白以上提及的事情。如果你們想以民族性來分析事情,你們都會感到震驚。因為獲得自覺,其實是超越你們的。自覺是極好的事情,對於你們,這實在是太多了。獲得自覺這事情,是超越你們的。

現在試想想。「你們都獲得了自覺。」你們相信嗎?你們能夠在此生得到自覺。假使有人告訴你這一點,你們絕不會相信,怎能在此生得到自覺呢?當然,你們都在追求某些東西,因為人們都說你們要去追求,你們亦感到自己要尋求一些東西。但你們不會想像到,你們所尋覓的,可以如此實現出來,你們都獲得了自覺。

因此,在得到自覺後,你們不會感到「這是什麼」。就好像當你掉進大海裡,你不會知道大海有多廣、有多深。你不知道自己去了多遠,「這是什麼?自己身處何地?我為什麽要在這裡?」把所有這些混亂加起來,我們變得無思無慮!因此,你們甚至不能以理性去分析自覺是什麼一回事。

對於這個浩瀚無際的經驗、母親降世所帶來的繁榮昌盛,以及你們獲得自覺這份寶貴的禮物,你們都不能以思維能力去完全認知。你們能夠理解究竟什麼事情在發生嗎?你們不能理解。因為理性不能令你們瞭解到你們現在進入了的範圍有多廣大。事實上,理性已經崩潰了,即使是去傳達有關人們為何求道,或是你們到達了什麼領域等事情,任何理性思維都不能存在。

你們現在都得到了唯一的方法、唯一的道路。滴水已經成了海洋。這滴水要溶化於海洋裡,這樣你才會感受到海洋。而且,你們要與其他水滴交流,這樣你們才能透過其他的水滴,認識到整體。

首先,你們要有完全的虔誠,這是非常重要。尤其在你們這一世,虔誠是極為重要的,因為你們都得到了自覺。假若你們還沒有得到自覺,那便沒所謂了;對於抱怨的靈魂,也沒所謂;對於不大虔誠的人,也沒所謂;有點兒行為不端,也沒所謂。所有這些事情,都會被寬恕的。所有人都以為是因為母親寬恕了我們,重點並不在此。

母親的寬恕源於她的本質。但你們不應該視這為理所當然的事。當你們接受母親的寬恕時,你們其實是在找自己麻煩。如果你整天都在想著:「啊,母親,你是多麼的寬宏啊!請袮寬恕我!」你其實一早已經被寬恕了,這是母親的本質。當你們稱我為母親時,我已經寬恕了你們。但這寬恕對你們有什麼得益呢?你們從中沒有得到任何益處,你只是個失敗者。如果你們至少能以理性來瞭解這一點,你們便會明白,虔誠是什麼。

因此,通過對霎哈嘉瑜伽的虔誠,人會認知到在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡的事情,你們在霎哈嘉所見的事情,全都是超越思維的,這是第一點。這些事情確實是超越人類的思維概念。因此,在人類的層面,你們並不談論霎哈嘉瑜伽,你們不會說關於霎哈嘉的事情。但在集體層面上,你們就能做到。

當你們來到集體層面,你們要明白,如果你們能以集體和一致的方式,確立你們與別人之間的關係,你們與我的關係便會越來越鞏固。

我對你們說過,水滴已經成為海洋。水滴要成為海洋,它要將自己所有的水點,溶入其他的水滴之中。當所有水滴都將自己的水點溶入其他水滴之中時,所有的水滴最終會一同成為海洋。

你們會看到,虔誠是兩方面的。一方面是彼此之間的虔誠,另一方面是對母親的虔誠。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽內,我看到的,你們都看不到。這要證明給你們看嗎?又或你們需要更多的證明呢?母親所看到的遠遠超越我們,現在這一點已經被證實了。任何母親看到的,都一一發生了。因此,任何人如果嘗試在母親面前玩弄什麼,他們其實在玩弄著自己。任何你們嘗試在我面前玩弄的把戲,又或你們認為母親很寬宏,她會寬恕你們。但其實,你們在令自己痛苦,你們是..... 這會傷害你們自己。

很多人常常說:「我的左腹輪有問題。」有些人說:「我被亡魂附體,有邪靈支配著我。」有些人會將問題歸咎於其他事情上。無論你們把責任歸咎於那裡也好,事實上,誰要求你解釋呢?只是自己要求,但其實你並沒有真正面對自己。

因此,對我的虔誠,就是面對你自己。你先要面對你自己,然後你才會看到自己在做什麼。

你才是自己的敵人。沒有人是你的敵人,你的母親也不是,這是肯定的。任何情況下,她也不會是你的敵人。任何的邪靈也不會是你的敵人,如果你不容許他們的話,他們都不會存在。任何壞人也不會是你的敵人,因為假若你已經在靈性上裝備好自己,這些壞人也不會有能力加害於你。因此,你才是自己的敵人,這是你自己決定的。消除你自己內在的敵人的唯一方法,就是你們要去奉獻。

譬如你們說,你們都很信奉母親,或者很信奉神,你們都握著一些東西,是不是?同時,你也摒棄了一些東西。而你們握著的力度必須是很強。理性地想想,當你們在下跌時,你們會否還去理解:「我應不應該握住拯救我的手呢?」你不會去想,反之你會握得很緊,你緊握的力度會極之強,出盡全力,並以完全的信念,緊握著這拯救力量,等待著拯救。

我們內在應該有這樣的感覺:「我所以下跌,都是因為我自己。如果我想得救,必須完完全全的投入霎哈嘉瑜伽之內。我要完全溶入霎哈嘉瑜伽之內,那麼我才會得到救贖。」

因為在這層次,這是你們已提昇至更高的層次,成為了覺者。現在,你們下一個躍步便是我現在說的虔誠。無論在任何情況下,其他的事情都是次要的。假若你仍然認為其他的事情是首要的,仍將注意力放在那些事情上,那麼,你便不會昇進至第二步。

你們已經到達第一個躍步,都獲得了自覺。但要從第一個躍步走到第二個躍步,你們必須很努力。你們都來到第二個躍步。在這第二躍步中,你們要去面對。你們不要厭惡自己,或者感到洩氣,不需要這樣。你們要視自己為獨立的存在體。

奉獻就是回過頭來,去看看自己,觀照自己內在那些神聖的品格。一旦你們擁有神聖的品格,你們在奉獻方面便不會有任何問題。你們會成為奉獻的整體,你會開始享受。

理性是最差勁的東西。理性其實在不斷欺騙你們,令你們偏離正道,令你們不知道自己原來一直都活在物質和粗糙膚淺的生活中。你們現在都從那些粗淺的生活之中走出來了,並成長起來。你們都昇進了。現在,你們要摒除理性,讓自己像花兒一樣盛開,散發香氣。只有摒除理性,你們才會成長,兩者是有連帶關係的。

你們要嘗試避免理性,避免爭論,嘗試不要去找理由。到了現在,有時候我還會聽見有霎哈嘉瑜伽練習者以心理學來解釋某些事情。「母親,她可能是感到不安全。人會因為感到不安全而做出這些行為,書本一般都是這樣寫的。」事實上,現在我們在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡都會看到,那些所謂感到不安全的人,大部分都是好侵略的人。那些人欺騙別人,損害別人的生命,並從中感到很高興。他們都是世界上最悲哀的人。你們都見過那些人,他們都是如此玩弄自己。

現在當你們明白了,你們不會玩弄自己。為何要玩弄自己呢?為何你要玩弄自己呢?你只需要做回真我,就這樣而已。我們絕不是自己的敵人,我們是自己的敵人嗎?

一旦你開始面對自己,你會喜歡自己。你不會厭惡自己,因為我所說的「你」,就是你的真我。真我是莊嚴美麗的,而且沒有任何污點(Kalanka),毫無執著。

但是,首先你要讓你的注意力接受這一點..「無執著才是我的生命,我有不同的人格。無執著就是我的滋養。」讓自己破除執著吧!

有一個男士來我家探望我。我家裡有一盞很漂亮的燈,這個男士很喜歡這盞燈。我於是對他說:「你可以拿去。」他感到很驚喜。他的妻子後來致電對我說:「為何會這樣呢?你為何會把如此美麗的燈送給別人?」我答道:「那盞燈算是什麼呢?難道我在死的時候,能帶走它嗎?那盞燈可否跟我一起走呢?只需要理性地想想。既然他喜歡,那就讓他拿去吧。我家裡有很多燈,他拿走一盞,也沒什麼分別。」這個女士說:「但你知道嗎?我曾經問過我的丈夫,如果他擁有如此美麗的燈,他會否送給別人?他說他絕不會送給別人。他說他真的不會。」他真是很誠實,他說他不會。但到現在我還不明白,為何不送給別人?當你們到了生命的盡頭,你們會知道你們能拿走的東西,只有很少很少。

就如只是拿著紗麗的一小部分,我們都能將整件紗麗拿起來。找著這紗麗的一小部分,我們便會拿回整件紗麗。只是一支很細的針,便能將整件東西拿緊。

我們要否定並遠離那些依附著其他東西的細針。嘗試觀看自己,「啊!這就是『自我先生』了。現在,讓我看看,你怎樣又回到從前那樣。」去觀看這些事情。你們看,就好像在看一齣戲那樣,觀照著你自己。然後,你便能愚弄你的自我和超我。事實上,自我和超我常常都在愚弄著你,但當你一旦成為主人,你便能反過來玩弄它們。

曾經發生過很多次。我曾說過很多件事情,同樣是在我說了之後不久,人們便開始談論起來。人們以科學證實等等類似的方式,證實了我所說的事情。你們都曾見過,這種情況發生過很多次。

我現在對你們說的每一樣東西,都是非常之肯定的。除真理之外,我不會說別的。我知道,我所說的全都是真理。但我不需要思前想後,找出某些事情究竟是否真理。我不需看書來核實任何事情。我對自己有信念,是「完全的信念」。我說的全都是真理,我完全知道,我說的任何話,都是真理。但是,你們則並非如此。你們說的,並非完全是真理。因此,你們應先建立這種狀態,那麼你們說的,都會是真理。

那麼現在,你們應怎樣做呢?你們的舌頭應該是這樣的,你們所說的,都必須要是真理。到了最後,亦會成為真理。因此,你們必須有奉獻之心。

什麼是奉獻呢?那就是「我為何說謊呢?」我們根本不用說謊。

就算我說了些謊話,那謊話都會變成真的。在我的情況才是如此,我說的所謂謊話,全都會變真。事實上,那些話由此至終都不曾是謊話。當我對某人說:「這人分明是個壞人。」他答道:「母親啊!他人品這麼好!你怎能這樣說他呢?」曾經有個叫米高的人,就是如此。「母親啊,米高真的很有愛心!」有些人更說:「母親,你是否妒忌他?」有些人居然能夠說出這些話來!但當這個壞蛋現出真面目時,人們才會明白。

因此,要建立這種對真理的知性,你們首先要將自己固定在真理之上。這真理就是:「你們都是上天浩愛的工具,你們都得到了自覺,如此特別的知覺狀態,其他人是沒有的。」站在這真理之上,並把這真理宣揚開去。你們無需害怕。你們都得到了自覺,這是毋容置疑的。你們都感受得到。你們要說出來:「我已得到了自覺。我什麼也沒做,我知道我是覺者。」你們必須肯定這一點。

在體現這真理之時,你們就好像光那樣。光肯定存在著,但光不只是存在,它還向人展現它的光芒。它向其他人展示出:「我就是光。你們都需要走在我的光明之內。否則,我的光可能會把你燒傷。」光擁有你們所說那種叫Tejasvita的特質。

Tejasvita即光的銳利。Tejasvita是存在的,這光的銳利。這光的銳利證明了你們之中存在著真理。你們不會害怕什麼部長、總理,或者什麼國王等等。你們會知道:「這是事實。我很確切地知道這是真實地存在的。我是已經得到自覺的靈,我就是真理。」如果你們說:「我是真理。」那麼,你所說的任何事情,都會成為真理,這是無需懷疑的。你所做的任何事情,都會成為真理。但請說:「我是真理。」

要做到這一點,你們需要真正的淨化,你們要通過奉獻的心,完完全全的面對自己。你們都緊握著母親的手,緊握著霎哈嘉瑜伽,緊握著你們找到的真理。而現在,你們都要面對其他人。如果你們不堅守著真理,你們便不能面對其他人,因為真理是你們的泉源。你們都站在真理之上。真理就是這力量,就是力量的泉源。

你們看看所有的聖人,基督擁有這真理的力量,穆罕默德擁有這力量,所有偉大的聖人都擁有真理的力量。他們以完全的勇氣,把真理說出來。人們都很接受他們的意見主張。這些聖人甚至會因為說出真理而受盡苦頭,但他們不介意。因為凡是真理的,都應該說出來。

關於奉獻,你們首先要知道,你們要完全的奉獻,你們不用害怕任何人,你們不會擔心自己有任何損失。

從前,有些聖人甚至失掉頭顱,他們被斬首。人們都折磨他們,搶去他們的錢。人們以各種各樣的方式折磨他們。但這些聖人仍然堅守這個真理。他們站於真理之上。其他的蠢才都站在虛假的東西上,但是聖人們都是站於真理之上。

你們都要知道「現在」,你們都站於真理上,你們要為真理而犧牲。這是因為你們所犧牲的,並不是真理。你們只是犧牲虛假的東西。

因此,你們需要一些有力量和勇氣的人,而不是那些一半忠誠的人,從早到晚都在請求母親的寬恕。他們在做什麼?有什麼需要求寬恕呢?我每一刻都在寬恕你們。你們在做什麼呢?你是怎麼樣的人呢?

你們要仔細想想,你們都站於真理之上,因此,必須成為堅定和勇敢的人。你們並且要擁有光的銳利,就是你們內在的指路明燈所發放的光芒。

同時,你們要有完全奉獻之心。

譬如當這盞燈沒有燈油,便會熄滅。這燈是需要有燈油的。因此,奉獻之心就是你們內在的燈油,這是一個依附的關係。你們要完完全全地依附於你們力量的源頭。這就是奉獻。這奉獻不會給予你任何其他的念頭,他只會給予你們閃耀的光,讓你們能夠改正他人,並指引他人的方向。

如果你沒有完全奉獻的話,你所連接的源頭,便不能把能量完全傳送給你,你這盞燈便不能妥當地燃點著。

因此,當你走進奉獻之中,你不要以為這是什麼讓步_________你們所謂的讓步,即是說那人會像個傻瓜。很多人都有這種想法,認為當人奉獻,那人便會像傻瓜般沒趣。事實上,你們反而會充滿活力!你們會成為真正的力量,不是破壞的力量,而是真正建設的力量。破壞其實並不需要什麼力量。只有是建設,才需要力量。如果去破壞,你們需要什麼?只是一點點的力便足夠。你能在一瞬間破壞整件事。但如果要建設的話,便真的需要極大的力量。這用以維持及流動著的力量必須要存在。因此,奉獻是必須的。

握緊你們力量的源頭,你們要充滿活力,並無畏地堅守著。這就是真理,這是你們要到達的真理。這是極之重要。

但奉獻只是其中一方面。這並不足夠。成為真理是一方面。而另一方面就是,當這力量的泉源進入了你之內,你會成為慈悲。真理與慈悲,其實是一樣的。你可能不會相信,但這是事實。就正如燈芯和燈油加起來,便會成了光。要燃燒燈油,才會有光。同樣,慈悲能給你真理。兩者並沒有分別,只是狀態不同罷了。只是你們不能看見成了光的燈油,你們也看不見正在燃燒的燈油。

因此,慈悲除了是你的力量之源之外,也是你們的儲備。從慈悲這源頭,你們得到了慈悲之心。

我見過一些人,他們想從我處得到慈悲,他們很想我去愛他們。但反過來,他們愛護別人嗎?我認識一些人,他們對別人說些很刻薄的說話,然後便來對著我說:「母親,寬恕我。」或者只為了一時興致,苛刻地對待別人,然後又對我說:「母親,寬恕我。」但當你這樣請求我寬恕時,我很想知道,你有沒有以慈悲來對待別人呢?就算我寬恕了你們,你們獲得了這寬恕的泉源、這愛的泉源,但你們有否將這愛給予其他人呢?你有否以慈悲待人呢?你們看,這慈悲並不是單方面的。當你們在享受這慈悲時,你們不能只是單向地接受,只想著自己的好處,然後便忘了這恩賜。這樣,你們是永不會成長的。

你們要成長的話,便應將這愛貯存在你們之內。所有我給予你們的愛和慈悲,你們都要貯存起來。然後,把這些愛給予其他人。否則,你們便會完結,並變得迷失。只有通過不斷地給予,你們內在的成長便得以持續,不只是單向地接受。如果你們不給予,你們只會停滯下來,且總會有些外流的。

但這是很困難的,因為人們很懂得拿取母親的慈悲。就算他們有慈悲之心,他們都只是對某些人,例如是對越南人有極大的慈悲,但對霎哈嘉瑜伽靜室裡的人卻沒有慈悲。他們好像更為越南人擔心,你們知道嗎?「母親啊!我們很擔心那些越南人,我們正為他們籌款,並會將善款寄給他們。」但在瑜伽靜室裡,他們則在互相爭鬥。這可不能算得上是慈悲吧!

霎哈嘉瑜伽練習者是來自不同種族的,他們要互相扶持,任何時候都應互相照顧。當我見到有些練習者批評其他練習者,我會感到很詫異!我真的非常詫異!因為你們同是上天力量的一部分。你們怎能互相批評!一隻眼批評另外一隻眼,我完全不明白。我能去批評,但你們應該這樣嗎?你們為何要互相批評?你們唯一要做的,就是互相愛護。

基督說過三次,我亦曾經說過一百零八次以上:「你們要互相愛護,這是唯一能表達慈悲的方法。」我曾經在何時給予了你們的愛,你們要以耐心和愛去轉贈給別人。有時候我會巧妙地誘哄某些人,他們隨即說些批評別人的說話來。

現在最基本的是,只有當我們的慈悲是流通著,我們才能夠從母親處得到慈悲。我在慈悲這方面做了很多,我發覺到,除非你們讓慈悲流通著,否則我沒有任何方法將慈悲給予你們。我的意思是,再沒有空間去吸取我的慈悲。最好是能把慈悲給予別人,讓自己留下點空間,那麼我便能給予你們更多的慈悲。這是很簡單的事情。在這方面,你們要明白到,除非上天的愛能夠流動並擴展開去,否則這愛的泉源便不能通過。

就好像泰晤士河。我們曾到過這條河流的源頭。那兒是一條很小的河流,從七條極之細小的河流,一點一滴地匯流而成,然後成為了泰晤士河。假設這小河流沒有變闊,這樣它只會停滯在源頭的位置,它不能夠流出來,不能夠流通。這小河流不是因生氣或煩惱而不流動,只是因為它流動的本質被阻塞而不流動。那怎麼辦呢?

因此,人要以慈悲待人。這慈悲並不是表面的,也不是感情用事的。這慈悲是自然而然,發自內心的感覺。它不是自我、超我和多愁善感的表現,而是當人瞭解到自己是霎哈嘉瑜伽士,瞭解到其他兄弟姊妹也是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。你們不是一般的兄弟姊妹,你們是靈性上的兄弟姊妹,你們都是聖人。

你們必須擁有這種發自內心的慈悲,並發展出強烈的父性和母性的感覺去愛其他人,我的意思是,我也是一個一百零八歲的瑜伽士的母親。你們真的要像母親般照顧別人,並對別人有愛和慈悲。你不需要理會自己的舒適,不需要去想有關自己的好處,只需要想別人的舒適就足夠了。你們先要去想:「我能做什麼令別人感到舒適呢?」然後才考慮怎樣令自己舒適。

當這慈悲的河流開始流動,你們便能達到完全的奉獻。因為你們明白到:「母親,任何你所賜給我們的,我們都會給予其他人。」這就是奉獻。因此,奉獻並不是單向,而是雙向的。你們依附著、連接上一些東西,並從其中獲得一些東西,然後再給予別人。最後,你們能成為整體,即回到本源。我們就在這光芒中明白一切。

獨佔一些東西,又或者是「我們已結婚,因此我們需要有自己的地方,要跟集體分開住。」這樣做是可以的,你們結婚後是應該有一點私隱的,我不是說你們不應這樣。但你們亦應考慮到慈悲這一點。作為已婚的人,你們應該更加更加具有慈悲之心。但是,你們只擔心自己的子女、自己的舒適、自己的丈夫、妻子。在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡,沒有甚麼位置容納這些人。所有人都是同一個集體。當你給自己的子女糖果,你也應該把糖果帶給瑜伽靜室的小孩。你們都屬於同一個家庭,所有的家庭都應該是跟隨同一個潮湧。我亦曾告訴過你們不應有分開的膳食安排,分開這,分開那。同樣地,我們不應給予不同的人以不同的生活質素。

我們要享受任何我們一起分享的事情。在物質的層面上,我們亦應該一起分享。在情感的層面上,那些荒謬、令所有人不高興的婚姻是完全沒有用的。婚姻的存在是為了將快樂帶給所有人。因此,在決定結婚之前,你要仔細想想,你並不是在玩把戲。在霎哈嘉瑜伽玩把戲,是一件極為危險的事情。不要以婚姻來玩把戲,不要試圖讓第三者加入,以為母親會寬恕之類。我是會寬恕的,但是你的昇進會變得很困難。因此,你們不要玩弄從前那些把戲。你們要完全地改變自己,完全地轉化過來。

現在,你們已經改變了對生命的態度。你們可以做到,因為你們都已經改變過來。如果你們嘗試變成另一個人,是無可能的。現在,你們都變成了花朵,你們不會突然變成葉片。現在,你們都成為了花朵,你們要活像花朵一般。你們必須緊記,慈悲是向外流動的,在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡,這是最自然不過的事情。對其他人來說,慈悲則一點也不自然。那些人只是在口裡說慈悲,他們其實一點慈悲之心也沒有。這些人做慈善,只是為了金錢,為了地位,和滿足他們的自我。但你們擁有慈悲之心,是因為你們需要擁有這慈悲,你們因慈悲而感到愉快。這慈悲在流動,因為衪是要流動的。你們都會做些慈悲的事情。慈悲的背後,並沒有任何目的。唯有當你沒有任何目的,才會在慈悲之中獲一些來自永恆本質的東西,即來自Sthayi本質的東西。

你們都看見有些人,正如我今早所說,有些人參與了一些組織,然後把那些組織做得很漂亮。但當他們一離開,那個組織便完蛋了。這是因為這些人沒有為那個組織付出一些實質的東西。他們要付出的,就是一個很大很大、並充滿慈悲的心。假如你們沒有付出慈悲之心,你們一旦離開那些組織,其餘的人都只會返回不能成長的狀態。這並不是成長。如果你灌溉一片土地來種植,那片土地便會茂盛地生長,並變得很美麗。但一旦沒有了水源,那土地也只會從回昔日乾涸的狀態。

霎哈嘉瑜伽是不同的。在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你們不只是生長成為一棵植物,你們還成為了植物的生命源頭。當這植物被拔出來移植到別處,這植物會將水帶給其他植物。你們知道嗎?你們內在存在著這嶄新的特質。這特質令這植物即使被拔起來,它也不會死去,完全不會。它只會不斷地成長,並幫助其他人成長。幫助他人成長,是我們的另一種成長。我們都處於這個與別不同的位置,我很希望你們每一個人都能夠做到,就算你們被連根拔起,並放到其他的地方......我亦曾見過,當我提醒一些人移居到其他地方會幫助他們昇進,他們聽了後都大吃一驚。「你們應該到某地方做某些事情。」他們聽了後都很吃驚。你們不只是一棵能夠走動,並將繁榮帶到其他地方的植物,還能夠給予其他植物所需的養份。你們所有人都是如此!因此,不要只停留在一個地方。假如你只停留在一個地方,那麼,這個地方必定有些問題。如果你好像漿糊一般老是黏在一個地方,這是非常危險的。你們要確信,你們必需離開這黏著你的地方。這不是說,人們來到這裡,就從不留在家中,任何時間都在外面。不是這個意思。我要再次強調這一點。否則,人們便來到這裡,整天都不回家。這不是真正的意思。真正的意思是,你們不應黏附著任何東西,也不應害怕離開任何地方,因為你們現在都是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。你們都跟海洋接合了,海洋可以帶你到任何地方。你們只需作好心理準備,會移居到其他地方,因為你們要將這上天的慈悲帶到世界每一個角落,並繁盛起來。在神的國度裡,你們都要侍奉衪。只有當你們知道,你們在這裡是為了一件「極之偉大」的全球性工作,這侍奉上帝的工作才可能發生。不只為了英國、印度或美國,你們在這裡是為了這全球性的工作,這工作是人類昇進的精髓。這是我們要為天地萬物以及做物主所做的事,是最為崇高的事情。你們都是被揀選出來的。不要讓你們的注意力分散到任何不能幫助你們達至真我的東西上。把那些東西全部摒棄,不要浪費你的精力。你們的真我,就是你們的慈悲和愛。

但仍然要說的是,這件事不應以理性來看待。所有我告訴你們的,只是為了將你們放到一個狀態,讓你們開始吸入上天的能量,以及將能量給予別人。這是一個動作,這是正在你們內在發生的事情。這不是理性,不是去想著這事情。只是告訴你這些,我便令你們的思維目瞪口呆了。你們要容許這能量在你們內在作用起來。憑藉這能量的知覺狀態,你們要審判你自己:「我有否將能量給予別人呢?又或我只在將能量儲存起來,並因此而傷害到自己呢?」

以上的講話會給予你們很大的意義,也會為你們帶來工作,就如我所說:「上天僱用了你們。」

If you have any questions, ask Me.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, if you become angry at any point with people, is that because it’s a tendency or a negative entity? Or is it just a tendency to react like that?

Shri Mataji: You see, if you get angry within yourself, and if you are sure that you are not doing anything wrong, for a Sahaja Yogi there is no need to say outside you are angry. There’s no need. That anger itself is a power.

And you should do your bandhan and anything that you want to do. But you should not show that you are angry. You should be absolutely silent. Because you can be; you are in the axis, you are not on the periphery. Actually, the anger is just to see your anger and use that anger for that purpose. And once you start doing that, that anger will itself work out. That anger will itself work out the person. And you’ll be amazed how it... but you must learn to see your anger that is working. All these things are important. You have seen that sometimes only shouting at the bhoots - they go away. And many mad people have been cured like that.

But you don’t do all that, that’s for Me. You must be always decent, with decorum and all that. But if the anger is because of your nature, or a tendency, or out of control - than it’s a bad thing. If it is an out-of-control, than it’s a bad thing. If you get into a temper because it is out of control, than it’s a bad thing. I can get very angry, but I am completely under control: I know I am angry, where the bhoot is, how he is running away; I can see it. But you can’t see the bhoot, you can’t see anything. So there is no need for you to get angry, show temper. But if you have an anger - say, for example, which makes you uncontrollable - then there is a mantra for that: Shanti [peace]. “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.” You must ask for that bliss, for that peace. This is a mantra for you. For controlling your temper, you have to tell yourself, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.” So Shanti is the point - the axis point is that - from where you witness everything. You are in Shanti, you are in complete... you are not in a turmoil even if you are angry. You are not in a turmoil. Whatever is anger is the power, and the power is taking charge. But unless and until that is achieved, what you have to do is to put yourself in a position that you are peaceful.

So I think that’s a very good mantra - is to say, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.” Can you say that? So the Shanti is your fort. But peacefulness never means cowardice. Never call cowardice as peace. A person who is peaceful is never coward, because nothing can transgress it, nothing can overpower it. It is never never possible that cowardice and peace can go together. But your power is inside, not outside. So you don’t show your power of your anger outside. But just little anger with anybody - you will see it will work out.

But first establish that... that position within you where you are the axis, where you do not allow anger to sit on your head. That is the growth. That is the growth, that you are at peace. Also... Another question? All right, satisfied now? Both ways you should know: that one is the anger that is detached - is perfectly all right; anger which involves you - work it out. So judge yourself as to what it is. Good question.Ask some questions.I mean, such intellectuals sitting here. Ask Me some questions what is there.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, what are Your plans to spread Sahaja Yoga in outer scale?Shri Mataji: What are My plans? I don’t plan. You see, I don’t plan, because I don’t know how far My instruments are ready, you see. First, now My only plans - if I have any - is to really prepare My weapons all right. Once they are done, then we’ll fix them up. You see, unless and until you know how far your bomb can fall, how can you plan it? So, first of all, I must measure up the power of My children, how powerful they are. That’s what I’m trying to do now - is to make them aware of their powers to use.Like, you see, Hanumana, when He was born and when He grew up, He forgot that time, and He forgot His powers. So He was to be reminded that “You are such and such powerful person. You don’t know what your powers are, you... you ate of the whole of Surya. This you did in your childhood. You are born with this power, but now, after growing, you are... rather bit... sort of forgotten it, and also you were afraid of using them, and it’s... sort of looks like in the dominant position. But it is there. If you just try to remember them, it will come up.” They have tremendous power, these people have tremendous power. But they have to assume and stand on that.

If they do not do it... You see, if I tell them, “Now, go to this house” - “Oh, Mother, there may be a bhoot there sitting.” A person comes possessed in the ashram - they all shut their doors: “Oh God, this bhoot has come.” Or something - then worse.

Djamel: Mother, may I ask you something? How can we deal with, You see, there is one problem, one big problem in Sahaja Yoga, You know. It’s those who are devoted to You at the expense of others.Shri Mataji: Those who are devoted to Me?Djamel: All those who use the excuse of their devoting to You, Mother, sometimes to oppress others.Shri Mataji: They are what?Djamel: Sometimes people use their devotion to You as, at the expense of others or-Shri Mataji: Then again the same thing, Djamel. It's the same thing is. You see it is: you have to do it. All those who are doing that way, I am just pointing out to all those.It you are using, say, your devotion to Me for the oppressing of others, all right? So it is for you to see.

There is nobody who can be oppressed, because your Spirit cannot be oppressed. Say, there is X and Y. Now, Y is a person who’s trying to oppress X, all right? What will you oppress? He can’t oppress his Spirit, can he? First point. Clear. Now, this fellow, if he has to have attachment to Me, nobody can stop him.There is all... you all have direct relationship with Me. Not through anyone. If you want to accept somebody’s agency, then I can’t help you. But, otherwise, you all have a direct access to Me. You all can grow your Spirits; nobody can dominate you. Everyone has complete freedom to grow their Spirit - to know their Spirit, I mean to say. And the Spirit is something... cannot be dominated by anyone. Now, supposing somebody tries to oppress you. What will they oppress you, in which way? They’ll say, “All right, we’ll not have this carpet, we’ll have that carpet.” Have it!Somebody will say, “I’ll jump in the sea.” Jump! Just now you jump! What will they oppress you in? You see, just see that. Not in your spiritual growth. Can they? And that’s how the problem starts. You see, in material things... say, in an ashram now somebody says, “All right, we would like to have a photograph of Mother put there.” The other will say, “No, we are going to have it there.” Whether you put it here or there makes no difference. My photograph is going to work it out. Even in puja matters I’ve seen: people will say that “No, Mother is sitting there, don’t put your feet towards the Mother.” It is common thing; everybody knows should not put it. But still they will say, “No, we want to put it.” All right, let them put it. Next time they will not, because they will know it is wrong. They will find out. So, you see, nobody can oppress anyone.

I am here to correct. Once you understand that you are not perfect, the other is not perfect, we are all perfecting ourselves, we are all coming up, Mother is there to look after us - then we will never think like that. Now. I’ve also seen, people will say that there are two Sahaja Yogis talking to others... Sahaja Yogis. Now, one is a very oppressive one, the another one is upset to see that this one is oppressive. Now, for that purpose, if you are quiet, silent - you will always dominate him. People will listen to you, not to him. But even if you start saying, “Oh, you don’t say like that,” this, this, they will think these are fighting cocks. Then, at that time, you are wise at this thing - will even give him a chance to understand. But what happens: one person dominates, another tries to dominate them by outward things. And the whole show is over. There is no need to dominate another person by outward things. He will settle down by himself if you show your dignity of your silence and of your understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

There is no need just now to say, “Shut up, you sit down, you don’t do.” It’s absolutely wrong. They do it, I’ve seen it. In My presence I’ve seen it. Because we still live halfway there and halfway here. The way we solve the problem... say, you have to do some business. There are two people doing the business. One person says something, another says, “Why did you say like this, you shouldn’t say.” This person says to that person, “You shouldn’t correct me.”

Like that the fight is on. But that doesn’t help anyway... there also. But in Sahaja Yoga it will never help. The another person can only win over by his dignity. By his quiet methods, by approaching a person properly. That’s how the leaders will come up. They won’t come up by shooting another person down, not at all by any chance. That’s not possible. Is not good leadership. Good leadership is judged the way you handle the situation.Not the way you fight another man down. So many times you have seen: I just keep quiet - it works out. Not necessary that you should at that moment shout. There’s no need. And it creates a very bad impression and very bad leadership. First of all, you cannot be dominated. This is one fact, is a truth. You can grow in your spirituality, whatever people may try to dominate in the worldly things. Thank God we don’t have any organization. Thank God we don’t have secretaries, assistant secretaries, under-secretaries, by-secretaries, upper secretaries, lower secretaries - we don’t have any nonsense.

Otherwise, even that would have been dominating to people. Then they would have fought that. So we don’t have that problem. We don’t have any money problem, because we don’t have all these nonsensical ideas. I’ve solved this problem by having no institutions, no positions. Everybody has position.

But the greatest position is of your Spirit, which you establish. The attention is not there, is more ego-oriented. The whole stuff is ego-oriented. You can’t fight ego with ego, you cannot. You can only fight ego or superego with Spirit. How much do I dominate you? I absorb all your aggression also. And how much do I dominate you? If I have to correct you, I go forward and do it, and tell you that I’m correcting you, whether you like it or not. And you see the result, it’s all right. But if you have that capacity, do it. Then there is lacking in you, that you cannot do that way, so be prepared not to, at least, spoil the show of Sahaja Yoga. One person is talking too much? All right, the others will say, “He is good for nothing, but another one is a sensible one.” But if you both are fighting, then I don’t know.That’s... doesn’t show any wisdom or growth, isn’t it? Does it? Those who think that by dominating in small small things you are going to achieve anything are wrong. Actually, I’ve seen, My grandchildren are realized souls. They are not bothered about these things, they don’t do this. This kind of a fight they don’t have. That “where to keep this”, “what to do this” - they don’t have. Nothing. At the most, they might fight for a chocolate or something, at the most. But in spiritual matters, they never fight. In spiritual matters they never fight. That’s a place one should not fight, one should not argue. That’s the point not to be argued, because truth is one. What is there to argue? You have seen all these saints, you see, those who have talked about Me. What do they say? Everybody says the same thing about Me. There cannot be any fight between saints, can there be? If the truth is one, how can there be fight? But because one is inadequate, another is dominating - both must achieve that state.

But the best is to be more dignified, more grown-up, more patronizing... People will definitely take to you because you will become the leader. Arguments are not going to lead you anywhere, I can tell you this much. No use arguing among yourself. If you have to argue, you have to argue with others, not among yourself. Otherwise now? What else? What is the thing?Any other question?

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, would You please tell a little bit how... how we fight our ego with the Spirit? How would you do...Shri Mataji: How do we fight the ego...Sahaja Yogini: ... ego with the Spirit.Shri Mataji: You see, you should never fight ego. If you try to fight, it will sit more on your head. That’s not the way to fight it, that there is ego and you fight your ego: “Oh, I’m going to box you” - then it will grow more, you see. The more you box it, the more it will grow. Never fight your ego. Only way is to see it. Your attention is very important, your attention is now enlightened. Whatever you see, it comes to its right size. It comes to its right side... size. Say, ego - if it is overgrown, you just watch your ego. That is, it is to watch yourself in the mirror, and you say, “Oh, Mr. Ego, how do you do?” Then it will come down. But don’t fight it. Just to be seen. All kinds of egos could be there. If you are overeducated, you are egoistical. If you are uneducated, you are egoistical - because you must try to show that you are something. All sorts of egos are there. So best thing is to see for yourself; that’s why I say, “Face yourself.” “Yourself” means your Spirit.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, that goes the same for the superego?

Shri Mataji: Yes, very much so. For superego also - not to be frightened. You should just say, “Get out! I can see you very clearly, you are there. You get out from here! How dare you frighten me? I am the Spirit. I am the Spirit, how dare you can do that?” That’s how. You see, ego makes you idiotic. Absolutely. Ego makes you idiotic, makes an idiot out of you, absolutely. And the superego makes you a coward. It makes you a coward. Now, how to fight it? “I’m not going to be an idiot” - if you say that, ego will go away. If you want to be an idiot, then he’ll be there to help you. If you want to be an idiot, all right, call Mr. Ego. You’ll become an idiot, straightforward.

Is the easiest way. Easiest way. If you want to become an idiot, simple thing is to call the ego. “You come, Mr. Ego, and settle down in me” - and immediately... this is a very simple composition. And superego... if you are a coward, then it sits on your head. Say, “I am not going to be...” Ham Ksham, as I told you, the mantra on the Agnya is. Either you have to say, “I am”; the other, I say, “I forgive you.”

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, may I ask You a question similar to what he said about superego? I’ll be particular. I’m still having problems with my eating. I’m eating over here. But I’m very afraid, I’m laughing because it is silly, that I’ll become fat. And I’m very afraid, I think a lot about food all the time. Yet I know that with You nothing bad can happen to me,Shri Mataji: All right, you do one thing just now. You put your left hand towards Me, andright hand outside.

She has the Hamsa here, caught up. There, you see the Hamsa. Tell her to come now. Come in, come in. I see, sorry. Put the Hamsa, I didn’t see it clearly.Hello [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi] We’ve been waiting for you.Come forward, you can come forward a little bit. Lots of people are there. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: What’s the time now?Sahaja Yogi: Quarter past nine, nine fifteen.Shri Mataji: Quarter past nine,

As I’ve told you, that relationship with yourself should be tyrannical. You should lash it down.You should absolutely make it clear to yourself that “I have to perfect myself if I have to give this my being to God. It has to be perfect.” Secondly, if you have to have relationship with others, it has to be ideal relationship. Sahaja Yogi with Sahaja Yogi - means something great. The greatest relationship is that.

With your sister, with your brother - it should be ideal. And in collectivity we have to be pragmatic. In collectivity we can change our course, we’ll take the way we like, the way it moves; we’ll manage it. But otherwise... You see, for example, take a plane. It has the same thing. Plane, when it is in the air, it can go wherever it likes. But the screws that are fixed in a plane are ideally fixed. They cannot just start... like a pilot seat doesn’t go to the back, and the back doesn’t come to the front, you see. The relationship is maintained.

All right? And the screws which are made, or anything that is made - is perfect. But airplane is not fixed. Airplane can go southward, northward... anywhere it wants to. Only the things that are in it are correlated with each other in such proportion that they cannot budge from their ideal positions. I’m giving this example because you are here. You’ll understand it better now. And these things that you have produced are themselves... are perfect. If they are imperfect, there will be a problem. It’s like that.

If you understand this very simple thing about relations and attitudes, you will never have problems. Your relationship with a Sahaja Yogi has to be absolutely ideal relationship. Otherwise, some screw is loose. Try to make it ideal. Say, there’s one person. You find the person is too egoistical, or something. Try to see what’s wrong with you, first of all: “Am I perfect? Am I all right? Or am I equally dominating, am I equally egoistical?

All right, if I am, then I better correct myself. But if I am not, if I am a good person, that way I’m not dominating - then I should try to bring down his ego by making sweet things to him, making nice relationship with him.” Try to be kind to him, so that his ego comes down. Manage somehow or other to establish ideal relationship. Is absolutely simple. I mean, I don’t understand what have I to tell in this thing. You know everything. That it has to be proper. Now see, the relationship between that and Me has to be proper, so that it doesn’t burn Me, isn’t it? It’s absolutely... in lifetime, also, we have to do the same thing - that relationship with each other has to be ideal to create the best results. It is so practical; I don’t know what is there to tell in this thing. And you have to be perfect because you are the unit. And the whole thing can be pragmatic. Then only it can be. But here just the other way round. The screws are pragmatic, the relationship is imperfect, and the collectivity is absolutely static. Doesn’t move. “The collectivity. After all, we are collective, bound to each other. How can we move, Mother, we are static now. We are bound to each other, we can’t move, you see.” Just like the Rock of Gibraltar. Now, you’ve been an aeronautic engineer, you should understand this better than anybody else, this example.

What else is the question?[To someone]: How are you? All right?I’m asking.

What other question?Rustom: Shri Mataji, could You say something about maintaining our attention so that it stays where it should and it doesn’t get diverted into trivial things?Shri Mataji: Rustom has asked a very practical question, it's true - that "to keep the attention where it should be."You see, for everything you have to do some exercise - abhyasa - not before Realization, after Realization. The best way is to learn how to watch yourself. Just now, sitting here, just put yourself into a position from where you watch yourself: "Now what am I doing?"This is the abhyasa, this is the study. Apart from mantras, apart from anything, the abhyasa is the practice, practice of becoming a witness. And the witness is the Spirit state. There attention will not go. I mean you will see everything, it is there, but attention will be inside. Try to practice this: "Am I a witness?"Now, say, some people say:" Oh God! I had a horrible time, Mother. This happened, that happened." You see, you are not a witness. How can you have a horrible time if you are the Spirit? You only have a horrible time when you are not the Spirit.If you can watch the whole thing as a drama that is played, then you are not having a horrible time, but this outside of you is having a horrible time, which you are watching.

That's how the attention can be fixed very well if you practice abhyasas, practice all the time to be witness. Say, you go out, you see something, just try to see it, not to think about it. Be a witness of the whole thing. The joy will be complete, and also you will become absolutely peaceful. Your attention will be completely enlightened.And then the inspiration you will get will be tremendous.

See, it's working out. Working out. Try to watch. And it has such a tremendous memory, if you know how to watch. I mean, to Me, if I see something - I mean, to Me it is just like a film in My mind. If I have seen this room, now I know what is in this design. Everything I know: how you are sitting, what pose you have taken, how you were, what was it - everything is like a design. You see it comes to Me, just like a picture - absolutely. Not of this life, but of lives.

Because that's a recording system that records best. If there are thoughts it's like something in between, you see. Now he is trying to record Me on the film, and if there is something in between moving, nothing will come in. But when there is nothing in between and you are just seeing through, you are recording everything that is important. Moreover you will be amazed, you don't record unimportant things.Like for people now, they go to a village, or any place. They will be recording: "Oh God, it was very dirty, and this happened and we went there and there were cement to sleep, for example, we get." Or: "Then we went inside, and there was no proper chair to sit down. And the chair was so hard, and my back started aching." All these things they will remember.And then what happened? "Oh God! I couldn't get Realization."Everything that bad, you see, just like newspaper - all bad news. But to a person who is a Realized soul in a real way, he doesn't see, I mean, you don't smell anything dirty. You always smell something good. You never smell, you do not think of anything dirty. Everywhere you go, it's beautiful. Even if you see just the sand, you see the pattern. Even if you see a barren hill.

I saw some people who had gone. I said, "Look at the beauty of these hills, in Maharashtra." They said: "Mother, what is the beauty? It's not covered with trees." I said, "That's the beauty, just see the patterns." They couldn't see the patterns that I was seeing. But if you ask Me, "What is this hill?" I also know that. Because I know the patterns of all the hills, how it has moved, how it has made patterns and things like that. Because they don't see that, you see, they cannot see the beauty because they are looking out for defects. Or relatively, you see, "English trees are better than say X, Y, Z trees. So then this is not better." The relative they start. But you are at absolute point, you are getting the absolute of everything. Everything is your own. What is there to judge?

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.Shri Mataji: Eh?Sahaja Yogi: Perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.Shri Mataji: I am the Artist and I am the Art. But what about you? Who are you? You are the... you are the one who is created, and you can create, and you can become the artist. That’s what I’m saying - that you are not only the light but the light that will give light to others. And, also, you will sustain that light which you have given light. This is the difference now between you and other people. Not that only you will be an artist but you’ll enjoy the art of the Artist. This is what you have got. You don’t know, you are not aware of your powers. It’s a dynamic thing which has happened to you, which you should take to.But our attention is on from where the dirt is coming, where the filth is coming, you know; where the ugliness is there. If your attention is on uglines- people tell Me: "There was, this was ugly." I said: "I didn't see." I just saw the way the elephant was standing, you see. The way he has pulled up his leg and he was raising his trunk. I never saw the dirt part of it. “Where was it?” “At the back of it.” I say: “I never went on the back.”

If your attention is so- even description of a person. You ask a person, “How is he?” “He’s a...” All his... I mean, little funny points will come to your head. Even the photographers, I’ve seen. They will only take photograph when you are in a funny way, you see; when your face is little turned round... I mean, it’s a seeking after ugliness, seeking after mistakes, seeking after something wrong. All the time if you do like this, you cannot be a happy person. All the time trying to find out defects, and faults, and mistakes, and dirt, and ugliness. I mean, you are in for trouble. You’re asking for it. Like a person was saying there are three-four ditches in this place. I said, “Did you jump into one of them? Better jump in. So, once for all, you don’t see any other ditch.” You don’t see the playing grounds, you are just seeing the ditches. For what?! The same thing can look ugly to a person who is of that kind of an attitude, who wants to see everything ugly. Try your attitudes. Try to see good in others. Try to see... not in... may not be... it... I’m not saying for other people, but I’m saying at least for Sahaja Yogis you can do it. Try to see good in them; what good they have done to Sahaja Yoga, what you owe to them, how to get along with them. Why not see the good of them?

By giving them encouragement, by being good to them you are helping Sahaja Yoga. But you want to help your ego, because you are very “wise”. So, then only, when by appreciating another person only, you have better relationship. This is a very simple fact. You see any film - there the two people are talking to each other as if they are barking at each other. What does it take to be kind, to be gentle, to say pleasant things? As soon as they will see a person - “Oh God! You have become very ugly!” This is the best compliment. That’s human nature - to see to the faults of others, to see to the wrong things of others.

You see, they will find out in anything. Somebody is very tidy - then that person is bad. Somebody is very untidy - that person is bad. Every sort of thing. But why not you do something about yourself, that there’s something inside you which is not tidy? And inside you that’s very upsetting. To Me it makes no difference, you have seen it. It makes no difference. If you say, I’ll sleep here. If you say, I’ll sleep on the... on the grass there. To Me makes no difference to what bathroom I go... I don’t even remember all those things. What is there to remember in a bathroom, and this, and that? All nonsense it is. I have no memory for all these things. Even if you want Me to know, I will not remember. If you ask Me, “How did you go to that bathroom?” - “Which one?” “That one.” I said, “It’s all right, I’ve been there.” Then food.

“What sort of a taste it was?” and “What food it was?” and... all sorts of things people go on thinking a lot. What’s the use? The whole food is going to just be digested in the same stomach. What is there to be so much worried about all these things? We are wasting our energy. I don’t waste My energy. I have no energy for wasting. In the same way, why do you waste your energy? Why not see to the better side of man? By seeing bad side, if you can cure it - well and good.

But if you cannot cure it, you are going to get yourself bad. If you can cure it - nothing like it. But you can’t. Also once... always person say, “I would not do that.” But you would do something else that the other person would not do. When judging others, one has to know one should judge oneself first of all. Because with what are you judging? With your ego or superego. I’ve seen, it’s a very common failing, which should not be there any more. Now you are realized souls, you are saints. And the saints... though olden saints might be doing whatever they did - forget them. But you people are not going to see the faults of each other but to the good points of everyone. Simple things I’ve seen: somebody says a wrong English word, or a Sanskrit word, or a wrong this - immediately you will catch on that. But he gives a big lecture - it’s all right. That nobody listens. Your mind is working: “What wrong thing he’s going to say?” Attention should be onto what he said, it’s so beautiful. And then you will develop an attitude - as Mine is - you’ll never see to the defects of the place. Never.

Never. [UNCLEAR]. You will have no eyes to see. I mean, Mine is like that, condition is like that, I tell you. It will be like that. It’s very difficult. Like somebody says, “You come and play those cards with sticks” - I never remember. I’ll always lose. So I said, “What’s the use of play it? I don’t remember.” See, everybody says, “You have so many brains otherwise, can’t you remember these three cards?” I can’t, I can’t. It’s just My brain goes off. I put automa... I don’t know. I look like a stupid fool when I play that game. So why should I play? Anything like that - I am absolutely good for nothing. So it’s a thing people know: “Oh, she is useless. Forget her.” But it should become automatic with you also.

Then it’s so enjoyable: how beautiful we are, that everything is so beautiful around us to see. Such beauty exists and we do not see it! Such tremendous joy! Every bliss is there flowing within us. And we don’t know, we don’t notice it. It’s such a happy thing. It’s such a beautiful thing. “Oh God, such a source of joy!” - was just standing next to Me. I never knew. And just I turned round and saw that force. Turn round! Turn your back to all conditionings of yours, the ideas that you have... Do not pass judgement, first thing is. Great art critics and all that, please, I beg of you, that do not pass remarks at anything all the time. Is ego playing the trick. Just watch it, how it is making you feel that you are something very great. Be careful. There were some people coming from America, have they come?

Sahaja Yogini: Steve and Christine, they called to say...

Shri Mataji: They haven’t come.

Sahaja Yogini: They’re coming in one week. One more week they’re coming.

Shri Mataji: So then we’ll decide, when they come here, what is to be done.

Shri Mataji: Linda, for your problem, what is the thing to be done? Will you get out of your personal problems or not?Yogini: Yes Mother.Shri Mataji: No, I'm talking to Linda now.

Linda: And, which ones?Shri Mataji: I would suggest you should stay with your mother. She needs you. She's an old woman; she needs you. You must serve her. There's nothing wrong in it.Linda: Very possessive.Shri Mataji: No, no, no. You are inadequate. Not that she is inadequate. You have to serve her.Give her love, affection. She's lonely. She behaves like that because she's lonely. You are inadequate. I wouldn't say to her anything. She never had love and you are the only child she has. You should love her. Give her more love, more affection, and also what she says about Peter, you should do that. Will give her consolation. She's going crazy because of that.Sahaja Yogini: The trouble is, Mother, she said, “It’s like ten years doing Sahaja Yoga.”

Shri Mataji: Let her say. Her saying, nothing matters. You see that's nothing. That's just an escape. Because you are crazy, that's why she thinks like that.Linda: I know that. I don’t blame her of course.Shri Mataji: But you should establish yourself with more patience, with more love and affection. She’ll say: "Do a hundred times Sahaj Yoga." How has she changed her attitude: because when you went there you went crazy. And you are quite crazy sometimes I've seen. First of all you must be a tidy person, neat person, must look after her.You must take up a responsibility of looking after. She's an old woman who has had no love all her life. What she wants is love; and as a child, daughter, you must give her love. Whatever she is, you can't leave her alone. If you give her love, I'm sure you can cure her. Take it up as a challenge and give her a bandhan. Everybody can give her a bandhan and put her right. You cannot be helpless like that to run away from your duties towards your mother, I will never allow you. You can go to Chelsham start a center there, attend it, do it. You have to.Linda: Do you want me actually to live with her?Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: Should she live with her Mother?Shri Mataji: Yes of course, why not? She's your own mother. She's not such a cruel woman. I don't think so. I've seen her. But you get crazy yourself. I know. I know that. This is how you will test yourself.You should live with her - after all she's so old now. What's her age?Linda: Sixty-four, sixty-three.Shri Mataji: See now, at sixty-three if she's left alone in that house, what will she do? You tell her that "I've decided to do what you have told Me about Peter."Linda: She hasn’t really told me anything about Peter. I’ve been doing most of the tellings.Shri Mataji: All right, whatever it is.Linda: She wants to-Shri Mataji: She'll be all right. You see, you try to tell her these things, she'll be all right. You tell her just like this: "And now I'm going to look after you, you are very sick, you're not well. Take care." Did you talk to her kindly sometimes?Linda: Well, I tried.Shri Mataji: No, you did not.You did not, that's what it is. As a Sahaja Yogi you have to be extremely kind and compassionate towards her. She's an old woman, had no love from her husband. She has tried to do something for you always. So as a daughter, you have a duty.

Linda: I’m very worried about Bumble because it’s a sort of 3-cornered arrangement which comes out.Shri Mataji: What happens about Bumble?Linda: Well, Bumble sort of finishes up in between me and her. It’s...Shri Mataji: But if you finish off from yourself, she won't be finishing off like that. See, why do you create a problem between you and her, first of all? There should be no gap. If there is no gap, then there won't be any problem. The problem is because you are a problem and she's a problem, so the child suffers.But if you just have nothing, if she tells, on the contrary, if a child tells anything about your mother, you should say: "Don't say like that to my- she's my mother." Tomorrow she will turn back and tell you that! Take it from Me.Linda: I mean in that way she’sShri Mataji: She's much more sensible in this than you are. You should not tell her anything about your mother. You should say: "She's been very kind to me and nice to me." If it is communicated to her, if through Bumble, things will be all right.See, how long is she going to live with this kind of life she has had. All right?

Where are you going to try your Sahaja Yoga if you can't try on your own mother?Linda: But she wouldn’t have it Mother.Shri Mataji: No that's not the way. It's not outside; it is inside.Linda: I tried to cook for her but she would’nt eat what I cook.Shri Mataji: You don't have to do it outside, you have to do it inside with her. Be kind, be gentle, be of service, at the most she'll shout sometimes, doesn't matter. Forgive her, forgive her.

Linda: I mean she has vomiting, which really worries me.My mother can't sleep at night, wanders around talking to herself the whole time.Shri Mataji: You see, it's all right. If she doesn't sleep, then you can say some mantras in your heart. You know there's a mantra of Nidra and all that ["Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu, Nidra rupena samsthita"]. You put her left to the right, she'll sleep off.You do it all that, she'll sleep. You should say that: “Breathe, three times, heavily you'll sleep off”. And if you, when she's talking also, if you sleep off, she's not going to wake you up again.You just doze off there and she'll say: "All right, you go and sleep now formally."It's very simple to fight out these things. I mean she needs you, very much. She can't sleep. Just imagine, your mother can't sleep. How can you run away from her? Just see her condition. She's your mother.Linda: She is in a terrible state.Shri Mataji: Then how can you leave her? You can't. You can't leave her. No, I wouldn't say that. You can't leave your mother.

You know, Kathy wanted to come with Me. Remember Kathy?Kathy: Yes Mother.Shri Mataji: And I told her, "You can't leave your mother in the hospital, come with Me to India. No, you can't." She missed that thing completely, I told her: "You stay with your mother." She's here, just ask her.Linda: Yes.Shri Mataji: I did tell her. And she was cancer, this thing with the Sahaja Yoga, and all that, and she used to attend to her. She stayed back. No, you can't leave your parents like that, you see. Parents are very important things. After a certain age, you have to look after them. Whatever they are, you must look after your parents. That's very important in Sahaja Yoga. Your Right Heart cannot be all right, Shri Rama cannot be all right if you don't look after your mother.

She's not such a bad woman. I've seen her.I, if she were a very cruel, horrible, this sort of thing, then I would have said: "All right, forget her." She's not that way. But she's not either so much - she's drinking because she has no company, she doesn't know what to do with herself. So she is trying to run away from herself. It's very simple to understand. You be kind and gentle. Give her some value that she's something to you, she'll be all right. I've seen she's not a bad woman.

Lot of her sense has come into you also, her goodness.Linda: I’m bothered I think by – when Grazyna came to stay she felt, Grazyna felt that she had this brother, you see, whom she worshipped. He killed himself in moto racing.She saw him dying in front of her.Shri Mataji: What’s it?Linda: She had this borther, my mother, who she loved very much and-Shri Mataji: That I have heard of already. That story I know, whatever she has done, whatever it is.Linda: She seems very fond of dying [unsure].Doesn't matter. By leaving her, are you going to help her by that? You should fill the position of that brother! You should say, "Doesn't matter, if the brother is dead, I'm here to look after you, mother." Why is she hankering after the brother? She thinks that if the brother had lived he would have looked after her in old age. But God knows if he had looked after, he would have run away, too.Why can't you fill the place of the brother? You can. Why not? You take it up upon yourself. You can do it. I know. All right? You look upon her as you look upon Me. Why not? Just try. It is worth it. It's worth it. Be nice and gentle. Say nice things, pleasant things to her. Show interest in her life. Actually you see all of this has come from these psychologists also. Horrible ones.[Lauhgter]No, they always say: "Mother did something." Everybody I saw they said, "My mother is like .." I said: "How can everybody's mother be so cruel?" Could be some people's, but not everybody's.

And also if they have deviated from right path, it is because they never got their love, they never got their place in life. See, the husbands must have ill-treated them, tortured their lives and must have been after them, or maybe they had some other problems from their parents or something. Everybody's mother has tortured.[Shri Mataji is laughing]It's a psychology, I think. That way a mother is in a way always, if you look at her from a wrong angle, she will look like your enemy.

In the West, the mother picture is horrible. Also wars, things have come in that generation. People have been shattered of their values. You must understand what kind of life this horrible Western society can give to women who are good. Good women are really tortured in this society. Only the smart ones and the ones who are very arrogant and who know how to put men right and women right in their places can exist, you see, this is what it is. It's a regular struggle here.Any good woman is tortured in this society. I mean, if she exists and she really lives, is something surprising. Ask, Maria will tell you. You ask her how they put them down, how they insult them, how - I mean, everybody has seen this happening here. But don't blame the mother all the time. At this stage, you must look after her.Hum.So now what is next?

Sahaja Yogi: Could You marry me and my girlfriend sometime in future?Shri Mataji: What’s it?Another Sahaja Yogi: Marry him and his girl friend.Shri Mataji: Who is your girlfriend?Sahaja Yogi: Oh, she’s not here tonight, she is-Shri Mataji: She's not a Sahaj Yogini?Sahaja Yogi: She comes from Bedfort. Yes, she is a Sahaja Yogini.Shri Mataji: She's a Sahaj Yogini.So you want to have a marriage on Krishna Ashtami? Some of the marriage to be performed? Sahaja Yogi: Yes, please.Shri Mataji: Now when is the Krishna Ashtami?Another Sahaja Yogi: Next Sunday Mother.[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: Some time in the future, not now.[Laughter]Shri Mataji: You see, the best place to get married is in India. Very easy and you have a real feeling because you come on a horse and this and that, you see?

But even if you want to have in Krishna Ashtami day, I don't know if you can get really somebody to do it - if somebody we can get, we should do it if there are people who want to get married.But you see Sahaja Yoga marriage is taken for granted. I've seen people do not have that understanding, and it's very dangerous to play with it, it's very dangerous, you see? So I think if you have some time given to yourself, I will definitely marry.Best thing I think is [to] let people take some time and decide. Because, you see, it's very funny, nobody feels responsible about it. They'll come out with a explanation: "Oh, I didn't understand and I was not in a position to do it, I was still possessed with a bhoot and I married another bhoot."[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: Ah, I’ve lived with her two years.Shri Mataji: With her?Sahaja Yogi: yes, with her.Shri Mataji: You see, you have given sufficient time now. But you see, one thing is their living is in the West, is simple people; but if you tell them "marriage", oh God. They go amok. They go amok. You see, if it's a marriage: "Ahhhhh."Ask David Prole, he'll tell you.[Laughter]

You see, because the law is so horrifyingly funny here, "marriage, oh God, it means horrible things. You have to separate. If you have to divorce- the first thing about a divorce: "You'll have to give so much money. " "Half money the wife will take away." "She'll murder me."[Laughter]You see, they show husband murders wife, wife murders husband, all sorts of things you know all the time it is like going on in this country. It's madness about marriage.So I think it's a good idea. I would like if you can arrange, because Krishna Ashtami's a good time to marry people. Our sixteen marriages, which one has failed? Last time. For the sixteen. No, sixteen here in London. Who were the sixteen people, let's see.All first class. All first class, yah? Yah.Good.So for next marriage lot. Some will be lagging behind like Nick, I would like him to marry. Now you're not so frightened are you? Nick?Nick: No.Shri Mataji: No, it’s good. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]On the Dashera day we can have marriage. The Dashera day, that's another day one can marry. Now Krishna Ashtami and Dashera day. Of course after the Diwali, after the marriage of the Tulasi, then only people start, but the Dashera day is very, very good. It's very auspicious. [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

So we'll have marriages on Dashera day. Till then prepare people for marriage. All right? The Dashera will be say about ... end of October, about. All right?Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother, thank you.Shri Mataji: Let's find out where will I be.So that's how.

Sahaja Yogi [Derek Ferguson]: Mother, I was going to ask, some Sahaja Yogis who’ve been in Sahaja Yoga for a long time don’t feel cool breeze; they don’t feel any catches. Some people feel burning all the time; some people feel these things in their head, in their body, toes, hands. It’s the way we’re gonna develop, where you can feel things - all of us, all over - or is it just some people feel different things?

Shri Mataji: No no. You see, to begin with, you see, it has something to do with your nervous system. All right? So, if your nervous system is disturbed, you may not feel, at all. For the nervous system, best thing is to do massage. You see, somebody should massage their back, hands... Also, I’ve told many a times that you rub your hands with vibrated olive oil, quite a lot, and rub these things, so they become sensitive. Could be with insensitivity. But if they can feel the catches in the body, that means they are all right, only the Vishuddhi is not all right. Rub the thing on the Vishuddhi, work on Vishuddhi, clear it out. And for Vishuddhi, if you can use, say, butter to rub on the- here [neck], and rub all these muscles, you see, with that. All these things will work out, for your hand.

But supposing there’s no cool breeze coming out of the head, possibly. Then the Realization yet not has established. See, other people should say whether there is a cool breeze coming, because the person who is not realized may not feel it. Supposing he does not feel it, and you feel it, then he is realized; only thing, his chakras are to be cleared out. It’s a different different category of people. Then, there are some people whose Kundalini has not risen; they are still Sahaja Yogis. Like that. Maybe. I don’t know if there are any. Those people who are unmarried for long, they are very difficult people because they never feel the cool breeze in the hand, quite a lot. Like that. But it is not so. They are realized souls in any case. They may not feel it, but they are realized souls, you see. Because a kind of a softness, a kind of a balance is developed after marriage - which is not there. And that’s how some people don’t feel it. There are various reasons. Some people who are ego-oriented more - they should turn their left to the right many a times. They should find out... from the hands, you see. One hand is bigger, one hand is smaller. That means the left hand - if it is smaller - that means you have to raise left to the right. You see, from the size of the hands and all that you can see it. Putting one hand towards the photograph, another hand outside... Work it out in so many ways, because you have permutations and combinations of certain mistakes. But that doesn’t mean you develop this Left Vishuddhi by any chance. Because that’s the worst thing that can happen. If you develop the Left Vishuddhi, then it’s a very difficult situation for you. Now, for this kind of a thing, I think I’ll give you a complete lecture on one day. Complete. As to see what permutations and combinations of different chakras can create. All right? But symptoms are outside. The symptoms are mostly outside; there’s no need to... from a personality you can see what it is he is catching, you see. Is a very... problem, great problem with people, that they don’t feel the vibrations; some people just don’t feel it.

How many there are like that, who never feel any vibrations? Never felt, never.Raise your hands. I know Kerry.Kerry: Not never.Shri Mataji: And you never- you have felt it sometimes?Kerry: Yes, yes.Shri Mataji: All right.Second Sahaja Yogi: Mother since I came to the ashram I`ve been, my hands have being very hot all the time.Shri Mataji: Which one?Second Sahaja Yogi: But I feel the catches inside.Shri Mataji: Both the hands are.What work you are doing in the ashram?Sahaja Yogi: Not very much Mother.Shri Mataji: All right, you had a left side catch. All right, you can see clearly your right hand is very shining. The left, there is a problem. You see these fingers are not so shining as the things are. You had a left side problem, if you remember it. All right? So, that's fighting. In the ashram the vibrations are fighting, that's why you feel hot. There's nothing wrong with it.It will correct; it will have cool breeze. Put your right hand always up and left hand towards Me. It will correct you.

Shri Mataji: When did you come?Sahaja Yogi: (Italian) Last Wednesday.Shri Mataji: Oh I see. You’re staying here in the ashram?Sahaja Yogi: No he is not here in the ashram.Shri Mataji: No. Where is he staying?Sahaja Yogi: In a Hotel.Shri Mataji: Why don’t you stay here and get your Sahaja Yoga alright? He’s from...now better. Alright.Sahaja Yogi: He’ll come tomorrow to the ashram.Shri Mataji: Good idea.[In Hindi Shri Mataji asks someone if they are ok]So now, can I go now?

Sahaja Yogi: We should offer You a sari.Shri Mataji: This is Gavin’s idea of a sari, isn’t it? What color is this?[PHRASE IN HINDI] What’s it? What a beautiful one! Where did you take this one? It’s like a painting. Where?Sahaja Yogi: Sahasrara Puja in Paris.Shri Mataji: In Paris? It’s beautiful! It’s for Me or for the ashram?Sahaja Yogi: He has brought it to You, Mother.Shri Mataji: Thank you. It’s too beautiful. Very beautiful it is. Thank you.May God bless you.You’ll stay here for sometime?

Sahaja Yogi: A week, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Week, all right, good. Christine, then I’ll come and see you all, Americans, eh? Here, Monday. And we’ll discuss about what is to be done in the future program. Now. Anything?

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I have brought You a present.

Shri Mataji: Present?

Sahaja Yogi: For small [THING?]. Some photographs.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. I would like to see. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? This is Italian style. See? Is Italian. They make everything so beautiful. [PHRASE IN HINDI] It’s very loving and nice. You had taken this photograph? And enlarged it? Beautiful it is. Very gentle and nice. This is from that garden... which I didn’t see? It’s beautiful lotuses Rustem has in Derbyshire. In Derbyshire, I couldn’t see that [ONE?], really. I was surprised, they say that you can’t grow a lotus here. I don’t know how they do it, really.

Sahaja Yogini: They call them something else, that sort of...

Shri Mataji: Must be. See this one. [PHRASE IN HINDI] [PHRASE IN HINDI] So beautiful they are. Rustem, you have become a great photographer.

Sahaja Yogi: He’s got four years experience.

Sahaja Yogi: They grow in Hampstead, Mother, too.

Shri Mataji: Hampstead?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they are in the ponds in Hampstead [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: I don’t know how they manage it, you see, this cold. It’s tremendous. But they grow in the cold because [UNCLEAR] also they have these. So, must be.

Sahaja Yogi: They can grow in the cold, no problem.

Shri Mataji: Now... [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] Now, Harry, your problem is solved?

Sahaja Yogi: Not as yet, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Why? What happened?

Sahaja Yogi: I called my employers, and they said that they’ve not quite sorted whether they should re-employ me. So they gave me one week. He said he will call me back next week.

Shri Mataji: Or you just go and tell them that “You give me just an employment,” saying that “for only three months at the most.”

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: But just say that “We give you employment, we re-employ you,” that’s all.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I’ll go to there.

Shri Mataji: What else?

Sahaja Yogi: These ladies are too shy, Mother, to tell them to come in.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Sahaja Yogi: Some ladies to give You the sari, Mother.

Shri Mataji: To give Me a sari? All right. This is the one that puja sari Gavin has brought. Who will give Me? Give it now. Come along, you girls. Also he has brought one sari for Me, which I... use it on Janmashtami also, from... [PHRASE IN HINDI] from Bombay. May God bless you. How is he? Did he get a job?

Sahaja Yogini: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: What did he say? He’s not [UNCLEAR]?

Sahaja Yogi: He got a job, he is the head of all the translators in Spain.

Sahaja Yogini: He called me last Tuesday, he said, head of... in the embassy... of the translate people.

Sahaja Yogi: The chief translator, is the head of the translation stuff in the embassy.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Sahaja Yogini: He says he has a big responsibility now, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Good. How much is he paid? How much is he paid?

Sahaja Yogini: 240 pounds.

Shri Mataji: How much?

Sahaja Yogini: 240 pounds per month.

Shri Mataji: Two thousand?

Sahaja Yogini: Two hundred.

Shri Mataji: And forty pounds. Per month.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s very reasonable course, Spanish [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: For Spain, it is. It is very reasonable.

Sahaja Yogini: Also, he’s work only six hours a day.

Shri Mataji: And where does he live?

Sahaja Yogini: He stay with Jose Antonio.

Shri Mataji: He’s happy there? It’s good that he’s got such a good job. All right. What is this you have done?

Sahaja Yogini: Michelle made it, Mother. It’s a [CROWN HERE?], Mother.

Shri Mataji: This you give Me on Krishnashtami, will be better. Isn’t it, with this thing?

Sahaja Yogini: Michelle made it, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Michelle? Should give Me on Krishnashtami, all right? It’s beautiful. All right. So just open the sari and put it on [UNCLEAR].

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, may I read Your hundred and eight names? May I read Your hundred and eight names? [IN WRITTEN?] shlokas.

Shri Mataji: Who? You?

Sahaja Yogi: Your names, yes.

Shri Mataji: Please, let read it out. Loudly. You have to raise it higher. Let Me garland [UNCLEAR]. It’s beautiful color. Thank you. It’s very sweet of the doctor Singh to give such a nice job to him Don, isn’t it? He’s a great man, doctor Singh. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] But we wanted some really Sahaja Yogi to go there. He knows Spanish also. But the doctor Singh is taking so much interest, I must say.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, but it’s only for three months.

Shri Mataji: All right. Yes, that’s what he said, that three months [IT IS?]. That’s it. It may go further.

Sahaja Yogi: He will have excellent reference after that work.

Shri Mataji: Now he can go to other places. He’s not so attached to anything; I found it from him. You see, Don is a very deep Sahaja Yogi, very deep. And he said, “I’m not so particular about Spain. Any place You send me, Mother, I’ll be going.” So he’s not so much attached to... he’s a very deep person. That was a good answer. So he can go somewhere else if he says,”It’s not that I get attached to Spain.” Let’s see. But you better grow now. Did he tell you what is the problem is? And must learn proper English, you see? That’s very important because Sahaja Yoga... I cannot speak all the languages. So better try to learn. In here, people should teach English to people who don’t know good English, all right? Not that English language is God’s language, but at least I understand it. Otherwise, all the English will have [A BIG EGO?]. And I can’t learn so many languages, all right? Try to learn English language and, also, understand Sahaja Yoga mentally. That’s important. Because you have to explain to people, talk to them. Because you talk, but it makes no sense on the other people if you have not mentally equipped. Those who are just attached to Sahaja Yoga with heart must equip themselves also with mind, must understand Sahaja Yoga with mind, is very important. And those who only understand with mind should understand it with heart. All right?

Sahaja Yogini: To reading “The Advent”, Mother, is very useful, very helpful to overcome this problem, because I had the same problems.

Shri Mataji: All right. Try to read “Advent”, explain to her, let her understand. How are you? You never came to the...

Sahaja Yogi: Unfortunately, I had to work.

Shri Mataji: I see.

Sahaja Yogi: But I [FORGET TO LET YOU KNOW?].

Shri Mataji: All right. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] [UNCLEAR] mangalsutra? You got two? One will sufficient, one you keep it for the next puja. [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI] You must get one made in gold. When I go to India, I’ll get you one. It should be used for puja. [PHRASE IN HINDI] And the same can be used every time. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, please forgive us for any mistakes we’ve made during Your puja.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Make a list now, and get it verified sometimes. And make a complete list, you see; so whenever you go there, try to remember. You keep one ready. Otherwise, don’t ask for it. Because it goes little funny there, isn’t it? Doesn’t look all right. Because you are such matured Sahaja Yogis. It is all right for children to make mistakes, but you are all matured people, so - doesn’t look nice. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, for Hampstead we do not know so much the protocol of pujas and how to... to behave in... there is no [ASPECTS TOWARDS YOU?]. Then, how do You suggest we should educate ourselves?

Shri Mataji: Next time when I’ll give you a lecture on this, all right? Because requires a real one big lecture, Maria. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, someone is bringing You some food. Food is being brought, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No. You see, My family people are going to have food with Me. I’m sorry. They are all at home. I’m sorry, I have to go.
