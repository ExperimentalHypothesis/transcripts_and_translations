Advice (Hindi) "Shri Kundalini Shakti and Shri Jesus Christ". Hinduja Auditorium, Bombay (India), 27 September 1979.

The subject "Shri Kundalini Shakti and Shri Jesus Christ" is very attractive and interesting. It is altogether a new subject for the common people because nobody has at any time before, attempted to establish any connection between Jesus Christ and Shri Kundalini Shakti. On the Virata tree of religion, saints of various kinds bloomed as flowers in many countries and languages. It is only the Virata who can know the relation inter-se amongst these beautiful flowers. Wherever they went, these flowers spread the sweet fragrance of religion. But even the people surrounding these saints could not grasp the significance of that fragrance. It is therefore, futile to expect the common people to understand the relation inter-se between a saint and the Adi-Shakti, the primordial Mother.

You would be able to experience or understand my view-point if you could attain the plane from which I am talking to you. Because at present, you do not have the necessary equipment to comprehend whether or not what I am telling you is the truth. In other words, you are not yet equipped to understand what the truth is. Until you are able to understand the meaning of the Self, the physical body would remain imperfect and would be unable to verify the truth. But once the physical instrument is connected with truth, you are able to verify the Truth. It follows therefore, that first you have to accept Sahaja Yoga and get Self-realization. After Self realization, the vibrations of Chaitanya begins to flow from your hands. If a particular matter is true, then waves of cool vibrations would start flowing into the palms, but if the same be untrue, hot vibrations would be felt. In this manner, you are able to know as to whether any particular matter is true or not.

Whatever the Christians know about Lord Jesus Christ is on account of the Bible. This book is very enigmatical. It is so much deep and profound that many persons have not been able to understand the hidden meaning of the Truth embodied therein. The Bible says, "I will come to thee as tongues of flames". Israeli people explained this to mean that, "When the Lord would incarnate, He would be emitting flames of fire and therefore, they would not be able to witness Him". The real meaning of this is that, "You would witness Me in the Sahasrara Chakra." You will find many references to the Kundalini Shakti and Sahasrara in the Bible, but only a brief reference is possible here.

Jesus Christ has said that, "Those who are not against Me, are with Me". It means, "The persons who are not against Me, belong to Me." If the Christians are asked to identify these persons, they have no knowledge about them .

Two great powers are combined in Jesus Christ. The first power is that of Shri Ganesha, who is recognised as his original power, and the other is that of Shri Kartikeya. Because of this, the incarnation of Jesus Christ is of complete "Brahman Tattva" or "Aumkar." Shri Krishna, He being the father of Jesus Christ, bestowed a number of boons on Jesus Christ prior to his birth. One of these boons was that, "You [Jesus Christ] would dwell on a plane higher than that of mine." This could be explained to mean, that while the plane of Shri Krishna is the Vishuddhi Chakra, located at the base of our neck, the plane of Jesus is Agnya Chakra, which is located at the junction of the optic thalamus [pineal and pituitary glands]. The second boon granted by Shri Krishna was that, "You [Christ] would be the support of the whole universe." The third boon was that, "You would be the first to receive one-sixteenth part of all the offerings made to Me in puja." In this way, after bestowing a number of boons, Shri Krishna permitted Shri Jesus Christ to incarnate on the earth.

You would understand these things better, if you read Markandeya Purana. Shri Markandeya, the author of the Purana has beautifully explained a number of such subtler points. In the same Purana, there is a graphic description of Shri Mahavishnu. If you would listen to this description while in meditation, you would notice that the description is of Jesus Christ only.

Now, if You study the etymology of the word, 'Christ', you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of word, 'Krishna'. As a matter of fact, the father of Jesus Christ is Shri Krishna. That is why He is called 'Christ'. The manner in which his name 'Jesus' originated is also very interesting. The mother of Shri Krishna, Shri Yashoda Mata, was addressed as 'Yesu'. Even today, we notice that in Northern India somebody named 'Yeshu' is not addressed as such but as 'Jesu'. It is therefore, clear that from 'Yashoda' came the word 'Yeshu' and then further became the word 'Jesu' and finally the name 'Jesus Christ'.

Whenever, Jesus Christ told stories about His Father, He was actually speaking about Shri Krishna, He was talking about Virata. Although, Shri Krishna did not reincarnate during the period when Jesus Christ lived on the Earth, His teachings centred round the theme as to how the seekers should know the Virata Purusha or God Almighty. The Mother of Jesus Christ was the Goddess Maha Lakshmi Herself. Mother Mary is none other than the Goddess Maha Lakshmi. She is the Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother. Therefore, Jesus Christ used to address His Mother as the "Holy Ghost".

Jesus Christ possesses all powers of Ekadasha Rudras, that is eleven powers of destruction. These powers have their centres located around the cranium of our head. When the incarnation of Kalki takes place, all these eleven powers perform the work of destruction. Out of these eleven powers one is that of Shri Hanumana, the other is of Shri Bhairava. In the Bible, these two powers are named as Saint Gabriel and Saint Michael respectively. After Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga one can awaken these powers by addressing them in Sanskrit, Marathi or even in English. The Nadi on our right side, which is known as 'Pingala-Nadi', is activated by the power of Shri Hanumana. Whenever, any sort of pressure or constriction develops inside this Nadi, it is instantly relieved by Chanting the mantra of Shri Hanumana. Similarly, even by chanting the name of Saint Michael one would experience relief in the Ida-Nadi. Ida-Nadi is on our left side and and manifests the power of Saint Michael or Shri Bhairava. Obviously, chanting the Mantra of their names relieves any trouble or constriction on the Ida Nadi.

The aforesaid matters can be verified by any person after Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga. The purpose why I am telling you all this, is to impress upon you that it is absurd to quarrel against yourselves after grouping as Hindus or Muslims or Christians. If you could see the principle behind all this, you would realise that all these saints are like many flowers on the same tree of religion and are connected with each other because of the one and the same power.

Perhaps, you would be surprised to know that in Sahaja Yoga, the awakening of the Kundalini very much depends on the condition of the Agnya Chakra of the seeker. In the present age, many persons are found with highly inflated ego [Ahamkara]. That is so, because most of them lead an extremely egocentric life. It is on account of the egoistic attitude, that man fails from his true religion. Man is misled, and therefore remains continuously busy working, thinking, etc., which are complementary to the growth of the ego. Jesus Christ is of great help for securing freedom from the ego.

As Paigambar [prophet] Mohammad wrote about awakening of the Kundalini and the ways of protecting oneself from wicked [satanic] powers. So also Jesus Christ told in very lucid manner about the powers in us as well as the weapons.

The first among these weapons is "forgiveness". The one which operates in the "Proksha" form in Shri Ganesha principle, manifests itself in the form of forgiveness in human principle. In fact, forgiveness is a very powerful weapon. It protects man against the ego. If somebody hurts you or puts you in trouble or insults you, then your mind is engrossed in contemplating on these matters and you get disturbed. You continue to think all the time about such a man, and by repeated remembrance of these events you put yourself in trouble. To overcome such troubles, we advise every such person to forgive one and all. Forgiveness is thus a very powerful weapon we have received from Jesus Christ. It enables one to get rid of troubles caused by others.

I have told you earlier that Jesus Christ possessed a number of powers and that He was endowed with the powers of Ekadasha Rudras. Then how is it that He was crucified and could not save Himself from this dreadful event? Jesus Christ, with His several powers, could have completely annihilated His opponents in a moment. His Mother Mary was none else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother Herself. She also could not bear the atrocities on Her son. And yet it happened. Perhaps God desired to stage a drama. Really speaking, Jesus Christ was beyond happiness or sorrow and He had to enact the drama in perfect and faultless manner. How foolish were those who crucified Him! Jesus Christ rode on a donkey so that foolishness among the people of those days could be eradicated. If you suffer from headache and you pray to Jesus Christ to forgive all those who have put you in trouble, you will be cured of your headache without the aid of any medicines. However, before such a thing can happen, you have to awaken your Kundalini by accepting Sahaja Yoga, and get Self-realization. The reason is that the Agnya Chakra, which is the Jesus principle in you, becomes active only after awakening of the Kundalini in Sahaja Yoga and not otherwise. Agnya Chakra is very subtle. The physicians are also unable to notice it. There is a very subtle door in this Chakra. That is why Jesus Christ said, "I am the door". Jesus Christ incarnated on this earth for facilitating the passage through this door, and He Himself was the first to pass through it.

People crucified Jesus Christ because of their ego. They could not conceive of an idea that some human being can appear on the earth as an incarnation of God Their intellectual pride could not accept this idea and they rejected the Truth because of the ego. What was the bad deed for which Jesus was crucified ? He had on the contrary cured many people of their ailments. He preached the Truth and taught many good things to the people. He showed them the way to live a very cultured life. He always preached Love. In spite of this, the people tortured Him. But they would bow before those who teach filthy and rotten things and make a fool of them. What a height of stupidity ! These days any Tom, Dick or Harry becomes a Guru, robs the people, squeezes money from them. Such persons are held in high esteem. On the contrary if a good person, who stands by the Truth, wishes to show the true path, the people not only won't listen to him but assault him. To educate such very stupid people God Almighty sent His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, on this earth. But the people crucified Him. They have been, ever since repeatedly doing the same thing. If you read, you will find that whenever God incarnated, or any Sage or Saint took birth on this earth, the people have harmed them and tortured them. Instead of learning from them, they behaved with them stupidly. We will notice the same story about Shri Gyaneshwara and Shri Tukarama, the great saints of Maharashtra. Similar treatment was meted out to Guru Nanaka and prophet Mohammad. Man always runs away from the Truth and tries to embrace the untruth.

Whenever there is an incarnation of God, or a Saint is born, and you ask a question whether such a person is an incarnation or whether he is a pious Saint, a Sahaja Yogi would immediately feet the cool breeze on his palm, if the answer is in affirmative.

The past events in one's life, result in strengthening the ego. For instance one boasts that he is a disciple of such and such person etc. Man is unaware of the factual evidence facing him. Obviously due to the strengthening of ego, he loses sight of the real meaning of the Self [Sva]. It is therefore necessary to understand the meaning of the "SELF". Suppose the river Ganges is flowing from a particular place, and you go at some other place and say that Ganges is flowing from that place, and that you are actually sitting on the Ganges, this will be ridiculous. Therefore, accept only that which is factually or materially present before you. In the case of Jesus Christ, the circumstances were similar. Jesus Christ tried to awaken the Kundalini, but with great difficulty could give Realization to some twenty one persons. But in Sahaja Yoga, thousands have got realization. Christ could have given Realization to many more but His disciples thought that He could only cure sick persons and that there was no other significance of Realization to them. On many occasions Jesus Christ demonstrated walking on the surface of water. This could be because He Himself was Pranava [Omkara].

In spite of all this, people could not understand that Christ was the son of God. In Sahaja Yoga, a number of seekers have got Self-realisation and got rid of the diseases. Man should, therefore, understand that the ego is very subtle. Another thing I want to tell you, is about fighting with your ego . That is not correct thing to do. The ego is not in any way effected by your fighting with it. It should get absorbed in your own Self. When your attention is focused on the Kundalini, and it pierces your Brahmarandhra, and therefore merges with Virata, it is at this stage that ego is absorbed. The real Ego is the Ego of the VIRATA SHAKTI. In fact VIRATA is the real Ego. You cannot free yourself from the ego. What do you do? That which I do is Ego [Aham Karoti, Sah Ahamkara]. You just ask yourself as to what is it that you actually do? You can do nothing except changing the form of dead matter. Can you transform a flower into a fruit? You are endowed with the nose, the face, the beautiful human body, How did this happen? We achieved this human form from amoeba. How could this have happened? It is undoubtedly the grace of God Almighty which enabled us to have this beautiful human form. Can we repay Him for this? Can you do anything which is similar? After man succeeded in producing a test tube baby, his ego swelled considerably. Really speaking here also man did not create any living organism. As in the case of crossbreeding of two plants, so it has been done here by uniting two living human cells. But how much it has inflated the ego balloon! Then, man reached the moon, how much further inflation of his ego took place! What is our ego in comparison to His. Who created the sun, the moon, the stars and the whole universe? In fact our ego is false. !t is fake. The true Ego is the Ego of the Virata Purusha. Because it is the Virata that is doing everything.

You should know that it is the Virata Purusha who alone is doing everything. Therefore, let all things be done by the Virata. You are just like a machine. Suppose I am speaking before a microphone, and My voice is carried to you through the medium of the microphone, then the microphone is only a sakshi or a witness. It is I who is doing the speaking and the power is flowing through the microphone.

In the same way, you are simply an instrument of God Almighty. The Virata has made you. So, let the power of Virata flow through you and understand the meaning of Self. In order to explain the meaning of the Self, Jesus Christ incarnated on this earth with His seat in the Agnya Chakra. Agnya Chakra is very complex, and is the seat of the subtle principle of Omkara or Pranava. In fact Jesus Christ is the Omkara, the Pranava. The connection between the Kundalini and Jesus Christ is the same as the one that exists between the moon and the moonlight or the sun and the sunlight.

The Kundalini, that is Mother Gauri, created Shri Ganesha by Her willpower, tapasya and noble deeds. It was when Shri Ganesha prepared Himself for incarnation that Jesus Christ was born.

There are many things in this world in respect of which man has not been able to find any satisfactory explanation. Have you ever considered how a seed sprouts? How you breathe? How you make movements? Where from the power in your brain comes? How you came into this world? There are many such things. Can any man satisfactorily explain these things? We say that earth has gravitational force. But from where this force came? A number of things need unfoldment. This is because you are under the influence of an illusion. You have yet to come out of that illusion. Your illusion has to be blown up, otherwise it would grow from strength to strength. For spiritual evolution of man, it is necessary to demolish his illusion. At every stage of evolution, the incarnations have appeared. All of you know that Shri Vishnu incarnated as Shri Rama, and wandered in the forests. He staged a beautiful drama to demonstrate the life of an ideal king. Similar was the life of Shri Krishna and the life of Jesus Christ.

When we study the life of Jesus Christ, one thing is noticed prominently, that is the stupidity of the people of that time.

Because of that stupidity this magnificent personality was crucified. And what height of stupidity! When the people were asked to express their opinion as to whether a thief or Jesus be released, the Jews demanded that the thief be released and Jesus Christ crucified.

We know the state of these people today!  The sin committed by them will not be washed away in many, many lives. And even now these persons are enveloped in their ego. They think that they have done a virtuous deed. Even now, if these people seek pardon of God, saying that, "Oh God! Pardon us for crucifying your sacred principle. Forgive us for destroying your sacred principle", God will immediately forgive hem. But man finds it very difficult to apologise. He commits a number of evil deeds. How many persons can be found in the world who have worshipped the Saints? Take the instance of Shri Kabir or Guru Nanaka. The people have persecuted them at every step. In this world the people have not given anything to the saints except harm and torture. But I tell you now, that circumstances have changed. The Satya Yuga has commenced. You may try, but now you would not succeed in persecuting or torturing any saint. This is due to Jesus Christ Himself. For Jesus Christ has set in motion a mighty power in this world which would make such wicked people suffer. They would be punished.

The Ekadasha Rudras of Jesus Christ are all in readiness to strike. Those who would now torture any saint, would be completely ruined. It is a great sin to torture any saint. You try to understand this from the example of Jesus Christ. Do not commit such stupidity hereafter, otherwise you may get completely ruined. If one great lesson is to be learnt from the life of Jesus, then that is that you have to remain contented in the state in which the Almighty has placed you. Jesus did not change His mission, He did not separate Himself from the society, considering Himself to be a Sanyasi. On the contrary on occasions He attended certain marriage ceremonies and made the arrangements. The Bible says that at one marriage occasion He transformed drinking water into fresh grape Juice. Now, man has picked up this one incident to suggest that since Jesus Christ made wine out of water, He used to drink wine. In Hebrew language you would notice that the word 'wine' means 'pure juice of fresh grapes'. It does not mean 'alcohol'.

Jesus Christ incarnated to open the Agnya Chakra and to dissolve our ego. My job is to awaken your Kundalini power so that it could pierce your Sahasrara Chakra. This work is of collective nature; I have therefore to do it. In the case of one and all, I want to tell you about Jesus Christ, Guru Nanaka, King Janaka and a number of other incarnations and the way they relate with the collectivity. Similarly, I wish to talk to you about incarnations of Shri Rama, Shri Krishna etc., and also about Shri Shiva, because all the powers of these Gods and Deities are in us. Now, the time has come for collective consciousness to manifest.

In this Kali Yuga, all those who are seeking God shall find Him and millions of people will be able to do so. Sahaja Yoga is the Last Judgement. This is described in the Bible. You are judged only after you come to Sahaja Yoga. For that purpose you however, have to surrender yourself completely after coming to Sahaja Yoga. After getting that, which means everything, it is important to dwell in it, to be settled and stabilised in it. Many people ask Me, "Mataji, when would we be stable?" The answer is very simple. Suppose you are sailing in a boat. Then you know when the boat becomes stable. So also while riding a bicycle, you understand that when you do not wobble, you know you are in balance and stable. So also in Sahaja Yoga our stability is understood. The judgement in this matter is to be made by the individual himself. It is only when you stabilise in Sahaja Yoga, that the state of thoughtless awareness is established. So long as the Kundalini power does not pass through the Agnya Chakra, the stage of thoughtless awareness is not reached. This is the first step in the way of thoughtless awareness of the seeker. As soon as the Kundalini crosses the Agnya Chakra, the thoughtless awareness is established. It is the power of Jesus Christ which is instrumental in opening the subtle door located above the Agnya Chakra. For that purpose you are to recite the Lord's Prayer composed by Jesus Christ. After crossing this door, the Kundalini power enters the limbic area of the brain. It is after the Kundalini enters this area, which is also termed as the Kingdom of God, that the state of thoughtless awareness is established. in the limbic area of the brain there are Chakras which activate the seven main Chakras and also the secondary Chakras in the body.

Now, let us consider the reasons why the .Agnya Chakra is spoiled. One of the main reasons of this deterioration are your eyes. You should take great care of the eyes, as they are very important. Then the Agnya Chakra is also spoiled on account of bowing before or touching one's head at the feet of an unauthorised Guru. That is why Jesus Christ has told not to bow one's head before every person or place, because by doing so, you unknowingly lose everything whatever you have gained, You should bow your head only before an authorised person, that is the one who is an incarnation of God. Do not bow before any wrong place. This is very important. If you bow your head before a wrong person or place, your Agnya Chakra will get constricted. in Sahaja Yoga, I have noticed that nowadays, many persons have spoiled their Agnya Chakras. The reason is that these people follow a wrong Guru or bow before or touch their heads at wrong places. Many of the eye-diseases are caused due to such wrong practices. In order to keep the Agnya Chakra in proper order, one should always read the scriptures and the sacred texts. One should never read unholy literature.

Many people may say, "What does that matter? On account of our profession, we have to do certain things which may not be strictly proper." But then, by doing such unholy activities the eyes get spoiled. I never could understand, as to why people are bent upon doing wrong deeds. Even by looking at any unchaste and filthy man the Agnya Chakra may get constricted. Jesus Christ firmly told, "Thou shall not commit adultery." But I tell you, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes." Thus, it again comes to the eyes. If your eyes are unholy, you have eye troubles and your eyes get weakened. This does not mean that if you have to use spectacles, you become an unholy or improper person. it is the law of life that you have to use spectacles at an advanced age. The eyes are spoiled because you do not keep them steady, and are always moving them from one place to another. So also the attention of some people is constantly shifting from one object to another. These people are not even aware that such action spoils the eyes.

The other reason of deterioration of the Agnya Chakra lies in the manner in which you work. If you overwork then you become work-conscious. The work that you are doing may be good, but even then, if it is beyond the normal level, be it over-reading, overstitching or over-thinking, it will spoil the Agnya Chakra. The reason is that while you overwork, you forget God. During the course of such work, God consciousness does not stabilise in you.

The Kundalini is the Truth. It is sacred. There is no hypocrisy in it. It is not some thing which can be purchased in a shop. This is the absolute Truth. As long as you cannot recognise the Truth by following vama marg or the wrong path. When you will merge into the Truth, when you will get absorbed in it, only then you would understand that you are but an instrument of God Almighty, the Holy Father, that you are the instrument through which the power of God flows and that you are the instrument of the same power of love of God, which pervades the whole universe and directs all movement therein. This power is made available to you only because of Jesus Christ, through His crucifixion, What a great sacrifice on the part of Christ! It is due to Him that our Agnya Chakra has opened. If the Agnya Chakra of any person does not open, Kundalini would not rise, because the Mooladhara Chakra would also remain constricted till the Agnya Chakra remains constricted. if a person's Agnya Chakra is too much constricted, the Kundalini power would not rise, whatever efforts you may make. For removing the catch on the Agnya Chakra, we apply Kumkum. This has the effect of reducing the troubles of the ego as also other troubles. When the Kumkum is applied on the forehead above the Agnya Chakra, the Chakra is opened and Kundalini rises. Such is the intimate connection between Jesus Christ and the Kundalini Power. Shri Ganesha, who is stationed at the Mooladhara and protects the modesty of Shri Kundalini, also opens the door at the Agnya Chakra, for the Kundalini to pass through it.

What is it that we have to do for maintaining the Agnya Chakra in order? The ways are many. Extremity in every action spoils the society, and therefore excessiveness in any walk of life is not proper and should be avoided. Maintaining the balance enables our eyes to get rest. In Sahaja Yoga, there are a number of remedies for this, but it is absolutely necessary to get Self-realization, first. Then there are many exercises for the eyes which help to keep the Agnya Chakra in a healthy condition. One of these is to watch your own ego and think of yourself that, "Yes Sir, what is the plan and where do you propose to go?" This is how you may address yourself as if you are observing your own image in a mirror. If you do this, the strain on the eyes due to ego will be minimised.

The other area which is very important is that part of the back of the head that is exactly behind the forehead. It is in the area which is at a distance of about the thickness of eight fingers [about 5 inches] above the base of the neck, and is known as the area of Shri Maha Ganesha. Shri Ganesha incarnated as Maha Ganesha and the same incarnation is of Jesus Christ. Shri Christ's place is in the centre of the forehead and is surrounded by the kingdom of the Ekadasha Rudras. Jesus Christ is the Master of that kingdom. The Ekadasha Rudras comprise of Shri Maha Ganesha, as also Shri Shadanan [The Lord with six faces]. If you open your eyes, after awakening of the Kundalini, you would experience that your vision is somewhat dimmed or blurred. This is so because when the Kundalini awakens, the pupils of your eyes are dilated and get cooled. This happens on account of the action of para-sympathetic nervous system. Mere thinking of Shri Jesus Christ or contemplating or meditating on Him would relieve Agnya Chakra. At the same time it should be remembered that merely following the conventions or traditions and the lines of succession made after Him, does not mean contemplation of Jesus Christ.

Now, I will be telling you some eternal truths. Foremost amongst them is that looking at any women with evil intentions is a great sin. You can realise the extent of the enormous sin that is being committed by several people who stare at women at road sides with evil intentions. Jesus Christ told about this matter some 2000 years ago. But He did not tell it so openly. That is why I have to remind you about this bad habit. Jesus Christ told about this matter and was crucified. Jesus only told that this should not be done because it is filthy. He did not tell about the bad consequences of this action. This habit makes man behave like a beast, as his mind is day and night engrossed in evil thoughts. In our Yoga science it has been advised that the mind should be controlled and kept on the correct path. You should approach God with all attention centred on Him.

We are made out of Yoga. Ours is the land of Yoga. We are not egoistic, nor do we want to be so. We desire to live on this land as Yogis. A day will dawn, when the whole world would bow to this country [India] in reverence. Then people would know who Jesus Christ was, and from where He came! He would then be worshipped with due respect on this sacred land. In India, even today, the modesty of women is protected and they are treated with proper respect. All over our country, we regard the mother with great reverence. When the people from other countries would visit this land they would know that it is in this country that real Christianity is practised with great devotion, but not in countries which profess the Christian religion.

Jesus Christ said that, "We should be born again." In our country we refer to this process as 'Dwija' or 'born for the second time'. The second birth of any human being is possible only by awakening of Kundalini power. So long as the Kundalini is not awakened, one will not acquire the second birth, and so long as we do not have rebirth we will not be able to recognise God. You read the Bible after realization. You will be surprised to know that Jesus Christ has told nothing but the importance of Sahaja Yoga. Everything has been explained with minor details. Those who have no insight, misrepresent the matters.

In reality, 'giving Baptism' means 'the awakening of the Kundalini power' so that after it rises and pierces the Sahasrara, there is the union of the all-pervading power of God and the Kundalini power. This is, in fact, is the final job of the Kundalini power. But the clergy know nothing about this. On the contrary, they are vainly trying to do something which they are not even authorised to do. Otherwise you will find these clergymen involved in all sorts of acts of kindness: kindness to animals, service of the poor, service of patients and so on. You would say, "Mataji, these are all noble deeds." Yes, certainly they are noble deeds but then, it is not the work of God. It is not the work of God to serve the poor by paying them money. The real work of God consists in helping the people to enter the Kingdom of God, and to enable them to unite with God. To make their life full of peace, prosperity, happiness, beauty and grace, is in reality the work of God. God will not catch the feet of the persons who commit theft, or speak lies or wander around because of poverty. To help such persons is an act of kindness and can be done by any person. You would notice some Christians involved in proselytising work. They would go to a remote corner where the Adivasis [Aboriginals] reside. There they would do some work of service to the Adivasis people and then convert all of the Adivasis to Christianity. But one thing should be made clear, that this is not the work of God. The work of God is eternal.

In Sahaja Yoga, the patients get healed when their Kundalini is awakened. In Sahaja Yoga, we do not perform any work of pseudo-kindness. If we go to any hospital, we can easily heal 25-30 patients. With the awakening of Kundalini they are automatically healed, because within us is the power of Love. Due to awakening of Kundalini, this power of love starts flowing through their bodies and the same power cures them. Jesus Christ healed many with the same power of love flowing through Him. Jesus Christ did not help anybody with materialistic things. We have to understand these things minutely. Do not repeat the mistakes of the past. You get yourself realized. This is your first duty. After Self-realization your powers are awakened. These awakened power have healed diseases like cancer which are considered as incurable. In fact you can cure any disease. Diseases like cancer can be cured only in Sahaja Yoga. But those who get cured again resume their old paths and habits. They are no more in search of God. Such persons remember God only when they want to be cured of some disease. They do not otherwise think it necessary to seek God. Why then should God care for those who do not desire to be the light of God ? Such persons, whether cured or not, would not spread the light in this world. God would light only such lamps which would spread the light in the whole world. Why will God cure the stupid people ? Why will God help those who do not wish to do His work or those who do not want to seek Him? The work to relieve poverty or social work should not be mistaken for the work of God.

Some people degrade the relationship with God to the lowest level. At one place, I observed on an advertisement board: "Shri Sai Nath Bidi". To use the name of God in such filthy manner is an outright insult of Him. By relating every petty and mundane things with God, you commit great sins. You should know this. "Sai Nath Bidi" or "Lakshmi Hing", advertising like this is an insult of God. What do these people gain by doing so? Some people say that, "Mother, this will do us good." What is this good? By that expression they mean they get more money. If a business is carried in this fashion, one or the other day it would surely bring them in trouble. This is the insult of God.

Jesus Christ came to save and liberate the whole mankind. He was not the personal possession of any particular sect. He himself was Aumkar incarnate. He was Pranava and the Truth. The bodies of the other incarnations were made up of "earth principle", whereas the body of Jesus was made of the "soul principle". That is why He was resurrected after death. And it was only through the resurrection that His disciples could know that He was no other than God Himself. Then they started beating the trumpets, started reciting His name, started delivering lectures on Him. The most important thing is that God incarnated. If the people should recognise Him and secure spiritual development and bliss, this would enlighten the soul and spread happiness and bliss everywhere. May all of you acquire the Yoga of God. Many many blessings.
