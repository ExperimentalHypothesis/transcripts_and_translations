My experience is going to be slightly different from everybody else's here, being that I was about 10 years old, so this was 31 years ago now. There were two sides to it for me. One was seeing the difference in my mum from the routes she'd been searching through before, which were on the same lines as Bernard—drink, drugs, and a few other bits and bobs. The day that she found Sahaja Yoga, she completely changed. My brother and I both noticed that this was something.

Even as a 10-year-old, I remember. She was a bit more loving towards us; there was a lot more love in the house. Some of the friends she had associated with before, who weren't so nice, were all gone, and we were surrounded by Sahaja Yogis. So that was an amazing thing.

Things were slightly different then than they are now. We were taken, sometimes against our will, to the seven-hour pujas where we had to sit through a thousand and one names. For an 11 or 12-year-old, it was sometimes a little bit boring. I remember being jealous of my brother once because he had a digital stopwatch to play with, and I had nothing.

I'm sure we were taken to Caxton Hall, and we were probably just at the back of the hall trying to stay out of the way. But I have recollections of Mother's first trip to Brighton. My mum went to the station—late, I think, as usual—in an old Vauxhall Viva to pick Mother up and bring her to our house. There were pujas in the front room downstairs, and Mother slept in my mum's bed.

In all this time when Mother visited your home, did you spend any time with her as a child? Did she talk to you, play with you?

Yeah, yeah. I don't remember any fear. As a 10-year-old, Mother was the center of attention, so I would just worm my way to the front and stand next to her. When Mother was getting in the car, I was standing at the door when it opened.

I also remember one time—I spent a lot of my youth in Brighton at the amusements—when Mother was down there with her daughter and her grandchild, Anand. I asked them if they could come down to the seafront and go to the amusement arcade. A big group of us went down to the amusements, and I know I've seen pictures of Mother and her daughter watching Anand play a computer game.

It was like an extended family, like a grandmother coming to stay. It was a lot different. There was no real fear; we just wanted to get up and be close to Mother whenever we could.
