(from Nirmala Yoga Nr. 16 - August 1983)

Spirit is the most precious thing that we have within ourselves.  The preciousness of your Spirit is immeasurable and that is why it is called the thing of eternal value.  Because it is infinite, we cannot measure.

Now, God the Almighty we say is 'Sat-Chit-Anand'.  Sat () means the 'Truth', The truth, we understand, in human terminology is relative.  But the 'Truth' I am telling you is  the absolute, from where all the relations start.  Example, I will tell you, how to understand.  This Earth has got oceans and rivers and all kinds of waters you can say.  But the earth is enveloping all of them.  If the mother Earth was not there, there could not have been any of these existing.  So we can say, that the mother Earth is the support, of all the things that exist on earth.  She is enveloping us. In the atoms, she exists, in the big mountains, she exists, because the elements are part of that Earth.  

In the same way is God Almighty.  The 'Sat' part of Him, the ,Truth' is the support of all the things that are created or not created.  Another example; you try to understand.  How, the 'Sat' is the ,Purush', is the God who does not take actual part in the creation itself, but is a catalyst.  The example can be like this.  That, I am doing all the work I am creating every thing, but I have a light in my hand.  Without the light, I cannot do anything.  Light is the support of my work.  But the light does not in anyway do anything about what I do.  In the same way, God Almighty is just the witness like a light.

But His another quality is the Chit', It is  Attention'.  When it is excited (in Sanskrit there is a very good word for excited, it is ( )  i. e. the pulsation) or when it is pulsated His attention or when it pulsates, then through His attention He starts creating.

And He has third quality which we call 'Anand', Anand is the feeling of 'Joy' that He gets by His perception, by His creation, the joy that He gets.  All these three things 'Sat Chit Anand' when they are at a zero point where they meet, then they become principle of 'Brahma'.  When these three things are one, where there is complete silence nothing is created and nothing is manifested but the 'Joy' is one with the 'Attention' because the 'Attention' has reached to merge into 'Joy' and 'Joy' has become one with the 'Truth'.  This combination of three qualities separate and create three types of phenomena.  'Anand' the joy inwards merged with His creation and with the 'Truth'. When 'Joy' starts moving with the creation, the creation starts, moving down from first, the 'Sat' or 'Truth' stage to Asat' i.e. 'untruth' to 'Maya' i.e. 'Illusion'.  And that time, the creation starts on working out and when it starts working out, the 'Joy' which is on the left hand side the emotional side of God also starts becoming grosser and grosser, till they reach a stage where there is, we can say, a complete darkness of Tamoguna, the complete cessation of the creativity and the complete, sleeping of the joy.  

Is it clearer?  You will understand now Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Mahasaraswati.  That is why Christ said, 'I am the light.' Because He represents the 'Sat' the light of God.  And when the light of God becomes absolutely gross, dormant or dead, then it reaches the second stage of creation.  Ail these things go deeper and deeper and become grosser.  That is one part of the paraboli.

Now the another part of the paraboli starts when you are attaining back to God Almighty.  That process now gradually starts becoming higher and higher, subtler and subtler and finer and finer.  In that refinement ultimately the light works for the evolutionary process. Gradually the grosser parts start becoming enlightened.  

You find the lower  animal is not much enlightened as the higher animal.  Gradually even the 'Joy' starts becoming subtler and subtler.  We can call it beautiful.  Human joys are much more beautiful than that of animals.  So the Joy also start changing their manifestation.  In the sense, you start more and more and wider range of 'Joy' comes into your hands.  For example, to a dog beauty has no meaning; decency has no meaning.  So at a stage when you reach, when you are a human being, to that extent you develop your  Sat' which is awareness; to that extent you also develop your 'Joy' and to that extent you also develop creative action.  Now you see how the ,creativity' of God passes into the hands of Man, when he turns out; how the  Joy  of God passes into the hands of Man and how His 'Light' comes into the heart of Man as  Spirit'.

It is beautiful.  I have just touched, when you have become a human being, people say human beings have a soul, not that others do not have, but light starts burning in a human being only.

Because of that 'light' we talk of religion, we talk of God and we talk of eternal things.  But it is really a precarious stage, that is, to be human being.  Because at this stage, you have to jump only a little bit that side, while you start jumping this side and that side.  Because this jumping is not possible unless and until the awareness reaches that stage, where you become independent and in that independence, you find your own course.  This is the position.  Because your 'Self' cannot be yours until and unless you are independent.  As long as you are slave or under bondage or something that is gross, how can you enjoy that eternal joy that is within you?  So it is for you to expose yourself more to that joy by opening out your 'Self' more and more and getting subtler and cleaner; so that you feel that 'Divine'.

Once you know this point that, after getting self realisation, unless and until these three things start merging together, you cannot feel that you have established yourself.  The Joy within you, must be felt through your awareness, otherwise you cannot see it.  Suppose you have no eyes, then how can you see ? If you were not aware to see me, how will you see me ? If you are not aware to hear me how will you understand me ? And once that awareness comes to You, then only the 'Joy awakens within you.  Because only through these subtle feeling of the awareness, you are going to absorb the Joy. 

 Just now you felt, you said "what a beautiful thing it is!" You felt very happy.  You are feeling the joy of creation at this stage and Man is the summit of creation.  But only the 'crown' part is such a little thing.  Very little it is.  Very little distance it crosses in no time, but only thing is that, three things have to be combined.  And that is why you find even if you get Self realisation, you do not feel the silence.  Because you have not become the 'Light'.  You do not feel the 'Joy' because you have not become the 'Anand'.  That is the left side of you.  In everything, there is 'Joy' as a human being, you start seeing 'Joy' in patterns.  You see a key box, you open it  out.  You see the patterns.  You call it the veneer.  You call the roughness and things, the smoothness and the harmony of it. You start feeling the matter, the Joy of His creation.  But after realisation, you start feeling the 'Joy' of creation.  The summit of creation is the human being and that is why for a Sahaja Yogi he must realise, if he tries to be friendly or interested or involved in a person who is at a lower level, he can never get the Joy' from that person.  Only thing what he can do is, to raise that person higher to his own level and make him also feel the same 'Joy' as you are getting.  

Supposing a man who is an artist marries a blind girl.  What is the use?  She cannot enjoy the Arts created by this man.  In the same way, if you are interested in your family people, in your relations, in your friends, the first thing and the finest and greatest thing you can do is to give them Self realisation which means the 'Joy' of your Spirit.  Expose them to the joy of their Spirit, which is the most precious thing.  And this is the reason, why people flicker and they fiddle and they feel uneasy and they lose their joy very easily at small things that has parts of it and finished.

It is like the ocean before you, where I am there and I want you all to come into it and enjoy.  It is all for you.  Whole thing was created for your enjoyment.  You have to become subtler and subtler.  You are wasting lot of time here on very gross things, you have noticed.
