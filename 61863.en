I bow to all the seekers of Truth. Human beings start seeking in the beginning they were seeking protection, security and then once the society started, they started seeking money. Some of them started seeking power. That is how we have developed two types of political institutions we will call as democracy and also as communism. But when they reached certain state of satisfaction or frustration, they started seeking something else. And they did not know what they were seeking but they were trying to seek the Truth. Seekers of Truth are a special category of human beings. They may not be very successful in life. They may not be very rich; they need not be very religious but inside them there was a great urge to seek the Truth. Also, the knowledge that we have out of our science and other enterprises is the knowledge of the tree. But we did not have the knowledge of the roots. So, they wanted to find out where are the roots. If you read certain newspapers and certain account of day-to-day happenings in modern times, you every day gets a shock, and you don’t understand how you go into terrible tensions and pressures of life. All these things end up into all kinds of physical, mental, emotional problems. And when we try to find out in the spiritual area the solutions for them unclear() even worst because the people who are talking about spirituality are themselves dishonest. Because of all these happenings, the seeking unclear(gross) much violent. Then people take to all kinds of things that are possible under the unclear(). But the truth if you have to discover, you have to know that truth we know is on our central nervous system. That is whatever you know through your senses is the Truth for you. For example, you are seeing the flowers here, everybody is seeing the flowers though they know it’s a Truth, there are flowers here. In the same way if you hear the music, you all know that there is music, and you can all feel it, hear it in your ears the music. In our evolution as human beings we have achieved a lot of things much more than that of animals. For example, a dog or a horse can pass through any kind of a dirty lane without feeling the dirt or the feeling of the bad smell. But the human beings cannot. So, there is a kind of a new awareness in a human being compared to an animal. Still, you have to say that we do not know the absolute Truth. If you been to somebody who is very sweet to talk and tries to persuade good things, you cannot make out if the person is trying to deceive you or is truth. It’s a relative world behavior. And we haven’t got the way of knowing the Absolute Truth. So, this urge comes into us when we want to know the Absolute Truth, but it is not for many human beings this feeling of knowing the Absolute Truth exists. They are not of that category, or they are not of that level to see that they have to find out something beyond. So, whatever you have heard just now about the subtle energies within you and the subtle system within you has to be understood like a scientist with an open mind. You have to find out whether it is a Truth or not and then accept it as Lord but not to accept or take for granted whatever I may say. Now as it has been explained to you that there is a subtle system that exists within us. This exists in all of us and the power of Kundalini which is the power of pure desire within us also exists in all of us. It is all within us this power is our own. Only thing is that we are not yet awakened to that new awareness where we could know what we are. That is possible very easily it can be done awaken this power within ourselves. It’s nothing really serious, it’s nothing really difficult. It’s just like this instrument we connect it to the mains. As this instrument is already there, and you are a computer which is already programmed. You are just to be put to the mains. But the knowledge is so fantastic and so unique that it is very difficult to believe that such a thing exists within us that it can worked out this way. That it is the easiest thing to work. In these modern times, we cannot believe that such a thing can happen. But we are fantastic. If you take supposing a television in an Indian remote village and tell them that you can see all the pictures in it, they won’t believe. But if you put it to the mains, they are amazed to see that the little box we call these wonderful things. In the same way when your machinery starts working by this Yoga, by this connection to the mains, you are amazed at yourself that how many capacities you have, how many qualities you have and how dynamic you are with all that you are so peaceful and so happy. So, one has to understand that talking about all these instruments is not going to help. If I have to put on the light in this hall, I have to just press the button. But if I have to give you the whole history of electricity and all that it means about it, you will say how do we know. So, this has to happen in a way that you should first get the light. What is the aim of our life? Why are we human beings? What have we to be after this? You have to be the Spirit. Because the Spirit-the Spirit is the source of joy, the Spirit is the source of knowledge, and the Spirit is the source of attention. When with this happening, the Spirit starts emitting its own light into our attention then your attention becomes powerful? Tremendous transformation takes place. You become absolutely free from temptations. You drop out all your habits and all the things that enslave you. You become a peaceful person within, and you become so powerful that you can give realizations to others. It has worked in many countries. Only Japan is the place where it is working that is good, I must say it. Which is like surprising why it should not work in Japanese in the same way as it is working in other countries. If you are the seekers of Truth then it will work no doubt. As a result of that all your diseases drop. Sahaja yoga has cured so many diseases, all kinds of diseases have been cured through sahaja yoga and there are two doctors who have now got the MD from Delhi university because they did the research on sahaja yoga. But it is such a miraculous happening that people when they get cured, they are amazed that without taking any medicines, without going to the doctors, without spending money how have they been cured of such horrible diseases. But actually, when this power rises and pierces through this seventh chakra here then what happens that the whole system gets nourished by this all-pervading power which is a Divine love. As you say in the medical terminology that the para sympathetic nervous system starts activating. It automatically gives you the balance, it gives you the nourishment, it gives you the joy, and that witness state by which you solve your problems in a remarkable manner. So, in your awareness you develop three types of new dimensions. The first to develop is the collective consciousness that is on your fingertips you can feel the centers of other people. You can also feel your own centers. In Quran Mohammad sahib has said that of Kaiama which is resurrection your hands will speak. These happenings are described in all the scriptures. And is said that you have to have self-realization. That you have to have a second birth. But it is not some kind of artificial certificate we can have that this is my second birth. When it happens you develop the first part as I told you is uncelar(realm) of collective consciousness then you develop a state which we call as a thoughtless awareness where you go beyond thoughts. You develop the capacity to redeem others and to comfort them. So, this is the epitome of your evolutionary process. Ultimately you have to achieve that. I am sorry in Frankfurt I am here for only one day-today. But we have a very good center here where people go and consult them after your self-realization. I tried three times to come to Frankfurt but somehow it never materialized. This is the first time I am here and that to for such a short time. It is important that we have to decide that it’s a very important moment way to see that jump that breakthrough which is promised to us. Of course, it’s a living process so it is spontaneous, and you can’t pay for it. And you don’t have to put in much efforts also.

I would like you to ask me some questions if you have, some sensible questions. Because I have not come here to take anything from you. I have come here to give you what is your own. What is your own property. So, you need not be aggressive with me. May God bless you.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, how to prepare unclear()

Shri Mataji: No preparation is needed. This question is beautiful that’s sufficient. The beautiful question, and that means you are already prepared.

Yogi: unclear()

Shri Mataji: No nothing is needed. There is nothing to worry about all these things. You have finished with that now and quite a lot in your last life and this life. Now time has for you to get it.

Yogi: unclear()

Shri Mataji: I do not do anything. You will do it. Then you become your own master, you can cure yourself. Not only that you will remove your negative forces, but you will remove of others as well.

Yogi: The question was Shri Mataji, from where did you learn? Who is your master?

Shri Mataji: I had no master. I was born with this knowledge. Now I would say that I wouldn’t tell you much about myself it is better you discover about me. See Christ said that he was the Son of God, which was the Truth, Absolute Truth. But they crucified him. I don’t want to get crucified for nothing.

Yogi: He is asking why is your picture here Shri Mataji, why is it important?

Shri Mataji: if unclear (I may check) if there has any objection for that? This is not the way you are going to get your realization. This is absurd. If I say why there are flowers? Why there are everything?

Yogi: Again, he is asking, what should we do to achieve self-realization?

Shri Mataji: You just wait for two minutes more.

Alright. So now I think let us have our realization. Now those who do not want to have leave the hall. Because I cannot force on you. I cannot. There is not guarantee. If it works that’s great. If it doesn’t will have to try again tomorrow or day after. All those people who are here in Frankfurt who have got realization can give realization to you also.

Let’s have it, I think.

Now one simple thing you have to do is to take out your shoes because you have to take the help of the Mother Earth, and also the tension on feet can be reduced by that. Please just take off your shoes. Out of at the very outsaid have to request one thing is that you shouldn’t be angry with yourself first of all. You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. And not to feel guilty about anything. Forget the past. Present is important. Secondly, we have to know that I would like you to understand how to raise your own kundalini also later on. Because though the Kundalini will break through your fontanelle bone area no doubt. But still possibly it will go back to the problems where it has to attend. So, you have to understand all about it. And you have to understand the decoding of these informations you get on your computer. What is decoding and understanding, you have to spend some time with people who are already here and learn from them what does it mean. The meaning of everything. So now, we have to put our both the feet on parallel line each other because these two are different powers within us. Now the left-hand has to be stretched just like this, this is symbolically expressing your desire to get your self-realization. You have to be comfortable. You shouldn’t sit with a very stretch body or with a slouch. But in a normal way with a proper neck straight. So, I will show you how you will have to do it yourself after closing your eyes, but just now I will show you. First of all, you have to put your right-hand on your heart, please put on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. Now, you have to take this right-hand on to the upper part of your abdomen and press it on the left-hand side. Because this is the center of your mastery. And we are working everything on your left-hand side. So, press it hard a little. Now, take your right-hand and put it on the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now raise your hand in the upper part of the abdomen again, because the lower part of the abdomen where you have put your hand is the center of pure knowledge. And when it starts working, the Kundalini starts moving upwards so, so now you have to put your right-hand in the upper part of your abdomen also to open it up. Ya ya this side left side. Left side. And again on the heart center. Then in the corner of your shoulder and your neck put this hand there and turn your head to your right. Now this center catches when you feel guilty. Now, stretch your hand in such a manner I mean put your hand across on your forehead and press it on both the sides like this. This is the center of forgiveness. Now take your right-hand on the back side of your head and put it back looking up. Now this is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness. Now stretch your hand like, stretch it like this and push back your fingers and put the centers of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone are which was a soft bone and bend your head. Push back your fingers. Now press it had and seven times you have to move. Clockwise you have to move it seven times. That’s all.

Now please close your eyes, you don’t have to open your eyes at all. You can even takeout your spectacles also. Till I tell you please don’t open your eyes. Because your attention has to go within. Alright, now you have to put your left-hand towards me. Put both the feet apart from each other. Please put like this, the simple way now listen listen, please open your eyes. Put the hand just like this on your lap, just on your lap just on your lap. And now, you start, if you have to go, please go because you should not disturb other people. Alright. So now please put this hand just like this on your lap on your lap, keep your fingers stretched. Now this hand has to go this way. Some people put it this way, no this way. So now, let us have it. Now you pleasantly placed towards yourself and close your eyes.

Now put your right-hand on your heart. Here you ask me a very fundamental question without any diffidence: ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ ask this question to me, you can call me Mother or Shri Mataji whichever way you like. You ask this question three times please. This question is to be followed by another question, that when you are the Spirit, you are your Master. So now please put your right-hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard and ask me a question three times: ‘Mother am I my own Master?’. Now please put your right-hand in the lower part of your abdomen and press it hard on the left-hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge of Divine laws. So you have to ask for pure knowledge, I cannot force on you because I respect your freedom. So please ask six times: ’Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge’. This center has got six petals, so you have to ask me six times. With this asking, your Kundalini starts moving upwards. Now to give Her a full way we have to slowly try to relax our upper centers. So now please put your right-hand on the left-hand side of your upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here now you have to say with full confidence ten times: ‘Mother, I am my own Master’. Now the most fundamental truth is that you are the Spirit. So now raise your right-hand on to your heart and here with your full confidence say twelve times: ’Mother, I am the Spirit’. Now one has to know that the Divine is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by that ocean. So, please forgive yourself and don’t feel guilty. So now put your right-hand on the corner of your between the neck and the shoulder press it hard and turn your head to the right by saying sixteen times: ‘Mother, I am not guilty’. Turn your neck to the right. Even then if you feel guilty better punish yourself by saying hundred and eight times. Now, please raise your hand to your forehead and press it on both the sides. And here you have to say from your heart: ‘Mother, I forgive everyone’. May be some of you might think that it is difficult but whether you forgive or don’t forgive, it’s a myth. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. Now, take this hand on the back side of your head and just put your head on it. For your own satisfaction alone, you just say: ’Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me’ but don’t count your mistakes and don’t feel guilty. Now stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area it was a soft bone, press it hard your scalp, push back your finger and move it seven times but I cannot force for your self-realization. You have to ask for it. So please say seven times: ‘Mother, May I have my self-realization?’. Press it hard.

Now take down your hand please. Slowly open your eyes. Now put your right-hand towards me. Bend your head and see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now put again your left-hand towards me. Bend your head and see. Now see for yourself if you are feeling any cool breeze. Again, put your right-hand towards me and see for yourself. Push back both your hands and push back your head and ask a question three times: ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the Chaitanya? Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Divine Love?’. Now, you see for yourself, you feel very relaxed. You feel very relaxed.

Now, those who have felt the cool breeze from their head or in their hands please raise both your hands. Again repeat it. Oh, great most of you have felt it. May God bless you. Those who have felt or not felt can go to our center and can establish themselves. Those who want to meet me can also comedown I would like to meet them. Can you remove the pot?
