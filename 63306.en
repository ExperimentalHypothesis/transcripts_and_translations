Debu Chaudhari Concert eve of Sahasrara Puja, Cabella, Italy, 1992-05-09

[2:33:43]

We all have to thank our Sahaja yogi brother, brothers we should say, Debu Chaudhari and [UNCLEAR]. I'm very proud of them.

[2:34:35]

As you know that vibrations travel through music and today I felt the ecstasy of enjoyment, you all were enjoying it so much. It's a blessing that you are all realised souls, no doubt but it's a greater blessing that music is so close to the spirit and that it acts in such a beautiful manner that though I mean some of you do not know Indian music, some of you know a few ragas some of them - you know very well. But the way, even enjoying the whole thing, completely rapport.

It's nothing but a spiritual flow of beautiful river of roads. Sometimes it used to be a very silent, simple stream then it would become like a big waterfall then suddenly it would explode then again it would smooth down. Sometimes on the tabla, sometimes on the sitar. I was just watching the flow of the beauty of these ragas especially the [UNCLEAR raga name] which you all appreciate very much. Has a great depth in it and it was played in the courts of great kings, long time back. But the beauty of this has to [be] understood because so many times who have understood that [UNCLEAR raga name] raga is very entertaining, is elevating and also makes you feel very majestic.

In this raga the one you have to understand first of all, I don't know if you know that. First the lower notes that are called [UNCLEAR] is the lower notes are first built up. That is the foundation is built up very beautifully. And the other style in it which is, which really helps you very much, is this; that you got to the [UNCLEAR - Tal?] means the [UNCLEAR] and then suddenly with the same note you come to the lowest. And that makes you feel the swing of the whole thing. And that really creates the feeling of this majesty. From this to that, that to this. So all these things without even understanding the intricacy of this music, the way you appreciate.

[2:37:24]

I must say I also have never learnt any music. I never known any music, I've never studied any music but my family is so full of it that I couldn't help listening to all that all my life and from my childhood, I've been listening to all the great musicians and that's how I developed such a taste and such a love for it. But apart from that it is really the spiritual ascend that you achieve, really easily become thoughtless and you just enter into the Kingdom of God and start enjoying it and that's the beauty of it. Especially that both of them have got their realisation very well. So they play in such a manner that a good rapport is established with all of you. And you all enjoyed it and you must be wondering why is it you are going into some other realm of unimaginable depth. It's very meditative as well as expressing of your beauty, of your glory within yourself. And I'm thankful to them because I didn't ask this time, Debu Chaudhari about it because I thought he was become a very big man now, he's got a big title from the government. So I didn't want to ask him, I said 'he may say that Mother I have no time or something' but it was so sweet of him that he offered his own [UNCLEAR]...all the way he came from Bombay just to come to this program. 2:38:53

It's so much obliging on us that really we don't know how to really thank him and to really award him for all this sweetness he has showered upon us. Only thing what we can do is little flowers to you and these kind words that I feel, that I must say that we are all very very much thankful to you.

[UNCLEAR hindi?]

[2:40:18]

I don't know if you understand the tabla also; the way you played with the big mathematics you know. Big mathematics, sometimes he played one and a half times and two, two and a half times with one hand another with another hand another it's a big, big, big mathematics you see. Only Indians can do this mathematics I think.

Ahcha [unclear copies] you want a copy of this music, they will have it. [Unclear they keep copies of it, hindi] automatically... recording [hindi]

[2:42:04]

So what is your plan now to have some nice dinner?

Debu: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: They will have afterwards.

Debu: After dinner?

Shri Mataji: Dinner, yes. After dinner we can have some music. Babamama is not here but still, Debu was missing him very much.

Debu: Very much. Mr Babamama I think there's a void [unclear]....

[Hindi or marathi] 2:42:38

Yogi: Babamama is coming in July, that is what he requested.

Shri Mataji: Yes, July we have him.

[Hindi or marathi] 2:42:43 to 2:43:07

Shri Mataji: Now this one was another thing is that Debu was wearing a dhoti another dhoti when I saw him. And he told me that this is all you have given me, the dress. But I thought the dhoti was rather old and it's not good for him to wear it for this... award he was going to get from the resident of India, I said it's rather old. So you see, I think it's Mother's love so I said I should find a dhoti for him somehow must get it. Can you imagine in my, in my suitcase this dhoti was there. Sahaj I tell you, really.

And immediately I sent somebody early in the morning, I said he must be busy. That you better give this dhoti to him and let him wear and even the president remarked that where did you get this dress. But just imagine the Sahaj part of it. It was, I mean I don't understand how it was in my suitcase. A dhoti in my suitcase, I can't imagine.

[Applause]

[Shri Krishna .....Hindi or marathi]

[2:44:33]

Shri Mataji: This is the [unclear] of Shri Krishna in which we described, the [unclear], that's the one, the [unclear]. But most remarkable thing was that I don't know how I must of put this dhoti in my suitcase. I couldn't understand I just opened it and it was there but I was thinking of [Debu's] dhoti's not all right, I wish I had another dhoti for him. And I sent it in the morning...

[Hindi or marathi] 2:45:03

[2:45:07]

Shri Mataji: Rajesh will tell you another story. He calls it a Mahasahajyog that had happened. And it was really very remarkable.

[Hindi or marathi] 2:45:18

Shri Mataji: It's a sweet story but a very remarkable. We went to the Home minister of India. He's a disciple of [UNCLEAR Sapdee Saibab?] also horrible thing. But we went there and the two photographs were there and I said ''Now what are we going to do here? We are going to tell him what happen in Anangpur.'' And there's no case and the case is not yet decided. I would think like a drama, you know. We were to go in the evening but he called us in the morning, he said ''Evening there's no time.''

So we went in the morning and the drama took place. First of all his wife said ''Do you recognised me?'' I said ''Err I think I recognise you.'' She said ''You don't know we went together to London so many of us.'' That time I was supposed to be a social worker so we had all gone to London together and all these ladies were orthodox from a very protected families. And when they was the condition of London things, you know. They got such a fright, they all started vomiting. So these people what are they doing, all these dirty dresses and all that. So I looked after them. She was telling me then how you looked after me and everything and I was wondering. There was about twenty five ladies so I didn't remember her exactly who she was.

[2:46:40]

Then she started praising me to her husband then a lady came, her name was Nirmala [UNCLEAR last name] [UNCLEAR they sent a word] I said call her she knows me very well. So when I was in 1942 a leader, supposed to be a [unclear] she was very young girl that time. She came and she saw me and just she forgot about the Home minster and then she just grasp me and she said ''Oh after such a long time, I seen..'' and she started praising Me to the Home minister. ''How she was a leader, how she fought the British and what happened and everything''. So the minister, the Home minister was quite surprised you see, this side of my life he didn't know. But then we were thinking how will this Home minister accept anything, you see after all a disciple of [UNCLEAR Sapdee Saibaba?]. So then we told him about Anangpur and everything and we had also complain about the person who had come with his camera from the [UNCLEAR]. We all thought had he's from the other party who was brought there.

[2:47:33]

And I was wondering can a government servant come like that so I went out and there was Maharani of [unclear]. She touched my feet and she [said] 'Mother you have forgotten, you had come to [unclear], to her palace and I have got your photograph, I worship you. And my son's marriage is there. It's such a nice thing I've met you, you must come, you must come for one day'. I said 'All right I'll see but I now have to go to Rome'. So she gave me the card, she said 'Can you tell this Home minister, he will listen to you, he may not listen to me'. I said ' All right, you go ahead and give him the invitation'.

[2:48:06]

So there was another gentleman standing there, he just touched my feet and he said 'Mother do you remember me?', I said 'No, when did we meet?'. He said 'In Anangpur', I was surprised. He said 'I am [UNCLEAR]'. I said 'Really? You are the same [UNCLEAR. You came from [unclear], who called you?'. He said 'Only you called me', I said 'I?'. [Unclear said] Yes, one Sahaja yogi told me, so I came and I have given a witness now about these people when they had a meet - they had a big case in Anangpur. I told them that I saw about seven people where very badly wounded and I got such a fright and Mataji was all the time saying 'Don't do anything, just sit down, you have to bear. Let them, stoners do what they like'. So the whole case turn to our side where we had complained about this man, can you imagine? In the appeal to the Home minister. Immediately I called that private secretary, I said 'No, no cancel this all, this man is on our side. We didn't know that because they said that he was on our side'. And when he gave his witness, they said that Mataji must have given him, three, four [unclear lacks] rupees that he's telling all these lies. And I was only meeting him that time, can you imagine? On the stage there so we cancelled. He said 'No, come along I'll tell the home minister', so he took me inside and he told the Home minister that I was there and this happened and all that. And this doctor [unclear] who is a horrible fellow and everything and he didn't know what to do then and this gentleman, Mr.[unclear[ who is our Home minister wrote down that please looked into the matter serious. So can you imagine how these things happen? I mean one after another, they all appeared on the stage. One after another. It was very surprising and they all started praising Me and telling things to him. He was quite stunned, you know. So then Rajesh said 'This is Maha Sahaja yoga'.

It's not, I would not say it's a coincidence but it is all organise by someone. All these things are organised and that is what we have to understand that there is God above everything else and He organises everything. We don't have to organise anything, he does everything for us. So I think now the food is organised for you, better have your dinner. And I'll come back again so thank you very much.
