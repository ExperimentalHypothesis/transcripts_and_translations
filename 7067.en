Talk to Sahaja Yogis. Cairo (Egypt), 29 October 1996.

Egypt has a lot to do with you people, when you got away, in the East, from the time of Moses, isn’t it?So, I am very happy that you could all come here and visit this ancient place and see for yourself.

We'll have to fight against all this nonsense that is going on to make the country weak. This is how any country will be weak if you divide the country. All these divisive methods make the country weak. When you want to join them together, then only the strength will come. But if you want to divide the country, these divisive methods are of no use.[Child speaking in Hindi]Shri Mataji: There should be methods of how to unite, how to bring them together. But I think, without Realisation, it is not possible. I have reached the conclusion. You see, because mentally what can you decide?Now they will think of Hitler, [unclear] that is there, they’ll punish them [unsure and unclear].But, whatever it is, Israelis can do a lot now. At least, they could get after Swiss bank. Don’t you think? They should put the attention to the Swiss bank.

Why not? There is one fellow who has started it in America. His name is Guy Anatole [unsure], who has bought from the- he is an Italian and not a Catholic. And he is being supported by the Jews of New York, who are very powerful, that they want to know about Swiss bank. That would be the best to come with that precisely.That would be the best that they find out about the Swiss bank. But it should be done in a very proper manner, I think.[Cut in the video]First, what you should find out. Because they have come to know that all their secret numbers are in the bank itself, kept in safes. So, Interpol should take them, stop all the banks and search out their names. And whatever money is owned by others, they do not have any money! They are Masonic people, horrible! And also, they are joined with Catholic Church. Another is Catholic Church, who have been so nasty with Jews as you know very well.There are all criminals joined together, absolutely criminals. Now I am in Italy, I know what it is. All kinds of criminality.

From India, they took away money, from us by force. And that money was taken to Vatican, was given as a donation to Vatican: after all, Vatican is God’s thing, yes? So, it went to Vatican. Then Vatican converted it to gold bars. Some of them believe in gold bars, not in money. So, it was all converted, was taken to Torino, where the house of our Prime Minister’s wife is. Rajiv Gandhi’s wife, Sonia [Italian origin]. And then that they took that to a bank in Switzerland. Somebody saw it. And those gold bars were put in a particular bank. And we are poor people in India. This is the trouble.

Now this is only a wee bit of one [bogus? Unclear 4:46]. In our country, all politicians, Prime Ministers - except for Lal Bahadur Shastri - all are absolutely corrupt. One by one, they are also going to leave, as in Italy. Since I have been in Italy, [they leave the country]. [Laughter]. Now when I was in India, this thing started. Just imagine! Unashamed! But if there is no bottomless pit of Swiss bank, then where will they send the money? You see.

You must write to the Jews, in America, what they are doing. In Brazil, the Supreme Court President and the Law Minister they met me. And they told me that there cannot be any law as long as America and the Swiss Bank are one. I said, "Why?" He said, "They impeached one president, impeached". One president in Brazil, you know that.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, of course.Shri Mataji: He is now a highly paid professor in Harvard University.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Jews can do a lot if they take sense into their heads, that is the point. Instead of that, what are they fighting? Jews should manage the Swiss bank.

Imagine these people, they melted the teeth of the people who died, made them into gold bars. And who carried them was this Red Cross. Can you imagine this Red Cross? I mean, if you ever happen to find my lecture, when in Basel, I gave left and right to this Swiss bank, especially to this Red Cross. You must read that lecture, a very powerful attack against the Swiss bank. Since then, they are after us. Nobody should say, you know, whatever they are doing.I am not afraid of anyone, and you should not be afraid of anyone. After all, what can they do to us?

But I think you all should all write to the Jews in New York that, "What are you doing? You have to do this". And to, also, to your Prime Minister. Why are they after the Palestinians? What are they going to get out of them? Get after the Swiss bank! Sahaja Yogi: This will solve the problems quickly. [Laughter].Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: This will solve the problems between Arabs and Israel.Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon, this will solve?Sahaja Yogi: Your idea will solve the problem between Arabs and Israel very quickly.Shri Mataji: Of course, that’s the solution.Sahaja Yogi: When they go to the Swiss Bank.Shri Mataji: Swiss Bank. Openly you won’t be surprised.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but Shri Mataji-Shri Mataji: I went down for a lecture in this conference, the women’s conference in China, I was one of the main speakers. So, a big paragraph on the Swiss bank, I spoke clearly.

Then afterwards, after the lectures were over, so many ladies gave their responses. They said, "The person who has really meet the point is Mataji Nirmala Devi. Because Swiss bank is our enemy". They were from all over the world, they had gathered there, they said, "Because of Swiss bank, we are poor". Why not people see this point? Bottomless pit, all our money is going down there.

But you Jews can do this work, I tell you as Jews, they are no more Jews, I know, but still. [Laughter]. Still, whatever it is.

And another great point is that they are Masonic people, this Swiss bank, they are all Masonic. So, they are secretive. Did you read that book ‘In the Name of God” in English language? From Yallop David. You read it. You will know all the tricks of these people. This Swiss bank has got Masonic people. And this Masonic law was also part and parcel of their Catholic church, built in it. And the sentries that are there, all the sentries, are all Swiss in the Vatican. Now this Vatican counterfeited 9 billion dollars, counterfeited. Do you know what means counterfeited?Sahaja Yogi: Vatican. Yes, fake, fake the money.Shri Mataji: What is it?Sahaja Yogi: Fake money.Shri Mataji: Fake, fake, fake. And gave it to their own customers in their own bank. Up to such a point, that book says, that the last Pope was a very good man and he was killed within 35 days, by this Pope. That is what it says, I don’t know.

I met Yallop [the author of the book] and he said, "I have all the documents with me. So, they can’t charge me".

Now the only point is that these Christians started saying as a view other religion is stupid, they started saying that Christ was crucified by the Jews. Now tell me any country can the multitude crucify a person? There should be someone body who is a magistrate or something isn't it? How can a thousand people say, "All right, kill him. Now kill him!" And then they got after all the Jews, these Christians, you know, and troubled them and tortured them.

So now the Jews are sitting on their head. And Freud, you know, wanted to make Christians really anti-God. So, he gave his own tips. You can see he was a Jew. That is how the Western culture became so corrupt. That is how the fundamentalists became so strong, it is a vicious circle.

But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t say, "Don’t do this don’t do that". We just don’t do it if it’s a wrong thing. Automatically isn’t it. I mean, I don’t say, I never said, "You don’t take drugs". Did I? Never, you just didn’t do it.So big responsibility on the Jews, I tell you, to get out of this Swiss Bank. They are the best! Because their forefathers who were gassed - they took out teeth, I mean it is such a horrible thing to do, and made them into gold bars,‘ne’, 3000 gold bars. Shameful people.

Also in, what happened in Rome? They didn’t allow what? They didn’t give protection to all the Jews, I think.Alganesh: No, no, the Pope.Guido: Ah, the Pope. Yes, actually, they never protest. They never say anything against. And on the contrary, they were protecting the Nazis. So, they were hosting the Nazis in the churches and then they were helping the Nazis to go in South American.Shri Mataji: And so many war criminals, they took away in the submarines to Argentina. I have seen, in Argentina, I have seen them there. You see, they have taught them all German things of the goose step and all that. And when Argentina was attacked, because of that island, I was just thinking that it should be lost to them. Because this German thing has to go away. They are building up huge big things there, ‘baap re’ [Hindi; express astonishment] I don’t know how many miles together for a third world war, these Germans, these war criminals. They are still hiding there, they are still in Argentina,Sahaja Yogi: Many.Shri Mataji: So, they took all the war criminals with them, in the submarines. What do you say to that?

So, for Sahaja Yogis, it is important to write to all the Jews: what are you doing about it? Your younger people will like to know.I will get you the addresses of all the Jews in New York. I have already sent Linda [Taylor] there, to find out. [Laughter]Divert their attention from Palestine to this, you see. It should be diverted to something constructive. What is the use even if there’s a Palestine, what will they get? What will they get? Little land more. So, what will happen? What is such an achievement? I just don’t understand.

Israelis must now realise that war has to be stopped. They have suffered a lot with war. No more wars, no more wars. At any cost, we don’t want war. But get after this. You see, as far as peace is concerned, I will manage, I think. But poverty, only this Swiss bank has to go. Only two problems we have: one is violence, another is poverty. Violence part, I can look after. I think I can manage. But this Swiss Bank...[Cut in the video]

Italian magistrates went there, I was told, to find something. They couldn’t find because there are numbers. But now they find out, the numbers only are kept in a vault. So, they should break the vault. Instead of fighting the Palestinian people, they should fight the bank, Swiss bank, you see? That’s important. Not for money, but on principle, they can save all the world by that.They are already doing it but if you people write, you see, they will feel more sort of energy about it. Since I have said it, in China, it has started working out, I mean.

[Apart:] Did I take out my socks? It’s there. I don’t know if there are socks. Let’s put on it

You see, so, Sahaja Yogis have some jobs, and that is a job. I have asked Linda and she will be sending you the addresses. And you all should write combined.

‘What will you do with the land added to you? What will you do?What will you achieve?

Now this war in say, going on, another war, which America is trying with Saddam Hussein. If these people, Americans, are so very sympathetic, say for Kurdish, so why don’t they take all of them? They are not going back to America. In the lower part of America, in the south part, it is all vacant. Nobody lives there, these are few Kurdish, take them there. But there are very troublesome people, you don’t know, I have had reports on them. They are not very sensible, they are not only rustic, but they are like Afghanis, you know, fighting cocks. Very big fighters. You cannot talk to them, they are not sensible at all! They are like nomads, nomadic people. They are nomads I think. But gypsies are better than this. And these Kurdish, to protect them they are throwing these things for Saddam Hussein. What is it after all? Take these Kurdish and put them in America, somewhere. They will be all right. Lot of room there.

Now you are Italian. Italy has so much of land which is just wasted land. So much land in such a small country and such a small population. But they don’t want any immigrants to come in. They brought some snakes, 3000 snakes, and put them in the jungle we had, because somebody told them, For ecological balance, you must have some snakes. In the winter, all the snakes died.[Laughter]This solution did not work out, I mean, in England, you will be amazed, half of the England is just vacant, half of the England has very few population. Isn’t it? So why not put some of the people there?

Then Australia, I am surprised, Australia is a barren land and there now, they don’t want any immigrants there. I mean this world belongs to the whole world. And if there are more people somewhere, why not have some of them there? So now people are protesting, Chinese are protesting about these immigration laws in Australia. Australia is so big and so difficult: you have to go from one place to another in the night, you don’t find even one single hotel. It is only there, Koala bears are prospering. Koala bears are prospering; too many koala bears. Crocodiles are prospering.Guido: Now rabbits.Shri Mataji: Hum?Guido: Rabbits.Shri Mataji: Rabbits are prospering. They are so much. They have so much of lambs that they are killing lambs. But they will not have, one of many surprising things, have human beings there. After some time, you may just find rabbits living there. [Laughter]Australia, the growth of white skinned people is minus. America is double minus, Europe: minus. So, all the white skin is disappearing.

They don’t think from a global point of view. The whole thing is limited, isn’t it? They never think what we are doing, what good it will do to the whole world. Never.

You must, somehow or another, get some Palestinians in Sahaja Yoga also.Sahaja Yogi: We have one.Shri Mataji: You have?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: Really? Who?Sahaja Yogi: He is now, actually, in Israel.Shri Mataji: I didn’t see any.Sahaja Yogi: He is from Germany.Shri Mataji: Really?Sahaja Yogi: But he is Palestinian.Shri Mataji: One person.Sahaja Yogi: It’s a start.Shri Mataji: Now get more. That’s the solution.

Djamel: We have no Sunnis Shri Mataji. We have no Sunnis in Sahaja Yoga.Shri Mataji: Hum? Sunnis.Djamel: Virtually, we have no Sunnis in Sahaja Yoga.Shri Mataji: No what?Sahaja Yogi: Sunni, Sunni.Djamel: Sunnis. We have Shias.Shri Mataji: In Palestine?Djamel: No, in Sahaja Yoga. Within Sahaja Yoga, we haven’t had any Sunnis who have come, naturally joined Sahaja Yoga.Shri Mataji: But you are a Sunni.He is a Sunni. Sunni now started. You are a Sunni. Another Sunni I know of is –Alganesh: You are a Sunni.Shri Mataji: Amzad. Amzad is a Sunni, not a Shia. Zafar is a Sunni. Only Iranians are not. Majid.Djamel: Yes.Shri Mataji: Majid is sufficient for all the Sunnis and all the rest! [Laughter] 25:33Djamel: Actually, they are two conditions: now you have to be Sunni and Arab, you see, it is a very difficult combination.[Laughter]Alganesh: That is too much.Djamel: No, no, you have to be Sunni and Arab. Now it is very easy to get a Berber. Berbers are easy to get into Sahaja Yoga, because they are not so conditioned. Like Aitchana, he is a Berber.Shri Mataji: Aitchana is Berber?Djamel: He is Berber, he is not Arab.Alganesh: He is a Sunni.Shri Mataji: Is he?Djamel: He is a Sunni but Berber. [Laughter]Shri Mataji: You are Berber?Djamel: [Unclear] I am supposed to be Arab in Algeria.Alganesh: Bedouin?Djamel: No, no, we are not Bedouin. We are actually Arabs.Shri Mataji: So now it is your responsibility to get some Arabs in Sahaja Yoga.Djamel: It is very difficult to get this combination of Arab and Sunni, very difficult. And they are much more fundamentalists, in general, than Shias or-Shri Mataji: You mean Arabs are more fundamentalist?

Sahaja Yogi: No, I think, I read, I was in Bahrain. I was in Bahrain, in Bahrain before.Shri Mataji: Yes.Sahaja Yogi: And I met – I am Sunni. And I met many Shiites. Shia.Shri Mataji: Ah, Shia.Sahaja Yogi: Yes from Iran and from Bahrain. Sunnis are moderate, moderate. Shiites are very hard.Shri Mataji: Really?Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Yes and I read their books. I read many books on Shiite. There is no a go-between, no middle way. Only right or left. Shri Mataji: The Shiite?Sahaja Yogi: Yes. But here in Egypt, we are Sunni. But we respect - Sunnis respect Imams of Shiite.Shri Mataji: Imams.Sahaja Yogi: Of Shiite.

Shri Mataji: Imams.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. But Shiite does not respect ‘chef’ [unsure] of Sunni. You know Al Azhar Hussain. Al Azhar Hussain Shiite Mosque. The mosque of Al Azhar Hussain.Alganesh: Yes.Sahaja Yogi: I am going to take some friends to see it. It is Shiite. One of the grandfathers-Shri Mataji: Hussain?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: I know, I have been there. I have been to all these now. And where is Ramallah [unsure]?Sahaja Yogi: Exactly. Yes. He was decapitated, they hated the Kaballah [unsure]. And he asked God to send punishment and torment on the people in Kabelah [unsure]. Because they cheated him. So, Shiite, I think Shiite are very hard from inside. And you cannot talk to them. I tried but.Shri Mataji: Yes but I met some Shias. You would be amazed. The head of the Shias of the whole of Europe has taken to Sahaja Yoga.Sahaja Yogi: Really?Djamel: Ayatollah Rohani.Shri Mataji: Ayatollah Rohani.Sahaja Yogi: Ah, yes, yes, yes.Shri Mataji: And another one. What was his name? He is the assistant who was Prime Minister of-Djamel: Ah, Benesadham [unsure].Sahaja Yogi: Ah, Benesadham, former Prime Minister.Djamel: The former president.Shri Mataji: They have taken to Sahaja Yoga,Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Great, yes.

Shri Mataji: So now, you see, these theories also trample down within, when it is Sahaja Yoga, I have seen it. Because this gentleman came to my program to get Self-realisation, can you imagine this man? Sahaja Yogi: No, no. I can’t.Shri Mataji: Have you met him?Sahaja Yogi: No.Shri Mataji: This Ayatollah Rohani, his brother was elected instead of this- what’s his name?Djamel: Ah, yes. His brother.Shri Mataji: In his place.Djamel: His brother was supposed to become the new-Shri Mataji: Who is now under arrest, home arrest, house arrest.Djamel: The Ayatollah of Ayatollahs. There is a name for it. And they took somebody else instead. I don’t know. Khameini or someone like that.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I know. Hassan Bani-sadr was, left Iran after the Ayatollah Khomeini controlled, ruling in Iran. I know this history.

Djamel: No, there was another story later. Recently the Ayatollah of- there is a rank which is the Ayatollah of Ayatollahs. He died. And he was supposed to be replaced by the brother of Rohani. And of course, they put him under arm [cut in the video 30:07 to 30:09]

Shri Mataji: ... To Russia and all that. And he has tremendous respect for me.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I saw him, you know, Mother to mark the death of Hussain.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: They cut with the long swords, hit their heads,Shri Mataji: What’s that?Sahaja Yogi: And yes, Shiite. And they catch ‘Resuls’? You know ‘Resuls’ [unsure; Tatbir, self-flagellation]? They hit their backs.Shri Mataji: Ah. We have that, we have that in India.Sahaja Yogi: Blood, blood everywhere,Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. Ibn Hussein [unclear] Hassan, we were not there. They are repenting.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, exactly.Shri Mataji: But out of that only, these people came to Sahaja Yoga. They gave up all the nonsense. You see, they gave up all the nonsense, and they have become great Sahaja Yogis.We have some very great Sahaja Yogis, you would be happy to meet them. Especially Majid [Laughter]. He is the last word. Very great Sahaja Yogis.And the one you have in Rome?Guido: Ali.Shri Mataji: Ali.Guido: Ali.

Shri Mataji: So this is stupidity. This was not told by Ali, Hasrat Ali, that you should hit yourself for anything. This is only ritualism they have done it, to make a big show, that’s all. It has no meaning. But these people have become Sahaja Yogis now. They have given up that nonsense.

In Sahaja Yoga, you will discover who was Hazrat Ali, who was Prophet Mohammed, who was Fatima, you will know. They are not like somebody coming up, they are ancient. And who they were, you will discover. In our ancient books, it is written about Prophet Mohammed: Maha Meda. This is the Meda, this place [Ekadesha rudras]. ‘Maha’ means the great. That part he resides here[above Agnya]. We believe that he is the incarnation of the Primordial Master. See the Islamic version, he, poor fellow, has no place at all! They don’t even think he was Divine. Was he like a radio, or what? Everything came to his mind. Can it come like that?This was all done by, I think, this fellow ‘Moawiya’.Sahaja Yogi: ‘Muawiya’.Shri Mataji: He did it.Djamel: ‘Muawiya’. Wazalli [unsure].Shri Mataji: He did all this harm to him. And another was Uthman, I think, I don’t know how-Djamel: Uthman, yes.Sahaja Yogi: They killed him. We called him ‘Hawalish’, he’s 'hawalish', like rebels now.Alganesh: He was a rebel.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: Like rebels, ‘hawals’ mean rebels. They entered on Uthman in [unclear]. His wife was sitting beside him, they wanted to kill him. So, his wife tried to protect him by exposing her hair, her head. It was a disgrace at the time, any man enters at the woman and she exposes her hair at this stage he should quickly do like this. They refused to leave, she exposed her face to make them ashamed and leave the room. Did you understand? As if I entered a room-Shri Mataji: Yes, I understand.Sahaja Yogi: Yes sorry, as if I entered the room, and I saw a naked woman, I should quickly do like this? They refused.They refused to leave and raised their hand with the sword and they tried to protect Osman. So, they cut her finger, this finger, but they killed him.Shri Mataji: They killed him?Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: All history is full of this nonsense.Sahaja Yogi: Then there was a war, a war between his followers and the [unclear].

Shri Mataji: What do you think of this Muawiya fellow?Sahaja Yogi: Muawiya Ibn Abi Sufyan?Shri Mataji: Muawiya, yes. His mother ate the liver of the fifth Calipha.Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes. But he is the founder of the Muawiya family and the ruling. Shri Mataji: My father told me all this, because he translated the Quran's texts into Hindi. My father was a great scholar of fourteen languages. He was a member of our parliament and a very well-known man. And he told me so many things that, what Islam was, is no more.Sahaja Yogi: Exactly, yes.Shri Mataji: ‘Islam’ means to surrender, to surrender to Divine. Islam word means that. But everywhere! Bible is changed so much! Bible is so much changed, you can’t believe it.The things they have said, Christ has said something, they have said something else. Because I have Divine eyes, I can see what they have changed. The way they have interpreted everyone is deviated, I tell you, human beings are such they can spoil everything. That’s their speciality. Say, you can go in a forest. It will be very clean, nice. One human being goes to live in a forest, you will know immediately what it is. That is what is in the religion.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. This is human beings.Shri Mataji: That’s everything they have done, ruined all the religions like this. And by ruining them, they are ruining the people also. And people believe - I really, sometimes I feel such pity. T for the faithful, you know. The way they pray, the way they do. Poor things, they have no connection with God. What are they praying? There should be the connection with God. Without the connection they are praying. What are they praying? To whom are they praying? Just think of it. You have no connection at all, and just praying morning till evening.

There was one fellow, a Sheik in Maharashtra, [name unclear]. He was a musician and a poet also. So, he told me that, "By doing the ‘namas’, both my knees broke. Then I took to these bhajans on going to Pandhapur with those things [Indian percussions], you see, playing this. So, I used to faint on the way. But Mother, then I came to you. In 5 minutes, you gave me Realisation". I said, "This is all due to your sweetness and innocence. But I can’t do that to you anymore". You see, then he’s a big Sahaja Yogi now. There are many like that, many.

In India also, you see, there are so many false gurus. And even if there are real gurus, they are very hard. They haven’t got a mother’s side at all.

One small story, I will tell you. There was one guru, one master, supposed to be very good. So, he was living on a big mountain near Kolhapur. One doctor lady came to see me and she said, "Mother I went to this guru and he told me, ‘You’re a fool. Why are you coming to me? There is somebody, Adi Shakti sitting there. So, why do you want to come to me?’ So, I come to you, to bow to you".

So when I went to Kolhapur I said, "Let me go and see this fellow guru, Gagangiri Maharaj".He had lost his legs completely poor thing. Because he used to sit in the water. He felt the heat of the people so much, that he always sat in the water. He lost his feet completely. So this Ganganagar, I had to climb quite a lot. So, the Sahaja Yogis started saying, "Mother, you never go to any guru. Why do you want to go to him?" I said, "You see the vibrations and you will know what a guru means". I went up to see this guru. It was raining, raining, raining very heavily. And this guru was sitting outside the cave. Very angry with the rain. Just imagine, I went into his cave and sat down. So, this Guru Maraj came inside. He came- they brought him as he cannot walk. He goes on a tiger. He came and sat on his - you can call - a junkier [unsure] we call it, this small little thing.

He said, "Why did you not allow me to stop the rain? You wanted to take out my ego?" Because he was supposed to be able to stop the rain. That’s what they said, he can stop the rain, all right? So, "Why didn’t you allow me to stop the rain?" Because he knew what I was, that was one thing. So, I told him, "See, you are an aesthetic, you are a sanyasi and you have got a sari for me. And you know I won’t take anything from a sanyasi son, so I had to get drenched. If I was not drenched with water, how will I accept a sari from you?" Immediately, he melted. Absolutely! Then he started crying absolutely. And of course, he sat with me. But he was talking on another level, not on a human level, but other levels above, God’s centres, doesn’t matter. Then he said, "Now I have to tell you one thing. I cannot be of great use to you, but if somebody troubles you, send him over to me. I will put him right".He had a very big name in Maharastra, Gagangiri Maharaj, you see, he is a very big man. He never beats anyone and all that. One fellow came to me and he started saying, "Mother, you must not give Realisation to everyone. You try to give Realisation to everyone. You go to [unclear] with me, he was giving me a big lecture.So, I told him, "All right. You go and see the Gagangiri Maharaj. He has called you". He felt very enamoured, "Oh, my goodness! Gagangiri Maharaj has called me!" So he went to Gagangiri.

After one month, I was sitting, one man, where I was having a program. And this fellow came with both the legs around his neck, dangling like that. Two people watched, "What happened, what has happened?" He said, "Guru ‘kripa’ [grace]. This is the blessing of the guru. So, "What happened?" "Mother, I didn’t do much, you see. I just told him that Mother should not give Realisation to everyone. Anyone comes in, she gives Realisation. She has no discrimination and all that. So in the night when I was sleeping, his tiger came, perhaps, and threw me in a cant. I came down about 80 feet down the hill.

I said, "80 feet?" "Yes, I saw a [unclear] and I broke my legs. So after two days, somebody poured some chapattis, I eat". "80 feet?" "No, no. He might have come down from the other side, from where it is but it came to me". Then he ate. "Then what happened?" "I was lying like that for 4 or 5 days, and nobody would bother about me. After 5 days, some people came, lifted me, took me there and gave me a bath and all that".

So, then this guru said, "Put these broken legs on your neck and go dangling to your Mother. She will cure you, not me". "My goodness! ", I said, "Really?" Tears came into my eyes. I said, "What? So, I fixed his legs, you see. He is still there. I fixed his legs.And I said, "Now what did you say?" "No, I just said, ‘This Mother has no discretion. She gives Realisation to everyone, and all that’. But what a punishment he gave me!" I said, "You see, that is what gurus are. If they are real gurus, they don’t want money, but they hit you hard. I know that". But I didn’t know they were so cruel as this! The next time I met him, this fellow, I told him, "But what do you mean by being so cruel with these students". He said, "Thank God, he didn’t die! Such people should not live, who talk such ill of Mother". But why this? Such horrible things! I said, "Baba, [unclear] nobody, I’m not going to send anyone to this, to any Gurus now, it’s finished".There are some real ones who are real, who are extremely harsh, very harsh and troublesome. But this is the job of love. If you have an ocean of love within yourself, you don’t have to torture anyone for that. It’s not necessary. While talking to you, you got your Realisation. I didn’t do anything to you, it just worked out. If it worked out, it is there.

And now it is becoming very easy. Formerly I had to work at least for 15 to 20 minutes. And with the English even more. [Laughter]. He’s one of them [Laughter] One of the early ones. They’re really.But now, yesterday you saw, in 5 minutes, given. So, it just takes on speed.I may go away tomorrow. I am sorry to say. I would have been so happy to stay over here with you. But I may go tomorrow. But you should look after these people. Then they will look after you. All right?
