How creative he is. See his creativity is really more interesting, he is creating experiences out of it, beautiful things, the way he is touching little, little notes and pulling it down, really it's tremendous, I must say. They are all great artists and all the time I am thinking of Ravindranath Tagore. What his soul must be feeling so happy, that is described one day and that's happening today with all these three Bengal people coming here really, my hats off to Bengalis and to Bengal, I really tell you. I am so indebted to them, so indebted to them, really, such a great thing, such great masters are coming out and they are from Nagpur also, that's something surprising for me. May God bless you all of you, may God bless you, they are great people. We have other artists also from Nagpur, so many of them so nicely played and you enjoyed their music. They are Maharashtrians I should say, so they used to say that Bengal mara balo se or Maharashtra mara gano se. They used to say that Bengalis have, very Bengali ladies have big, big long hair but now this other way round I s sometimes. Beautiful, isn't it beautiful. I am so very enamoured with the whole thing that has happened. May God bless them with greater and greater talent. But what a talent it was, what a talent, that's the point. Now those who played it, guitar, must know not to just go on like that. But use three fingers the way he was using it, all right, use all these three fingers. But the remarkable thing about guitar I have noticed, it has a much longer range and you can play with three, four fingers the way he has done it. While this one has a very small range, it's very deep, sarod is very deep but the range is very small. Here the range is very big and also all the fingers you can use, you see playing with that. It has...There are no notes, separate note.

Yogi: Frets.

Shri Mataji: Frets. There are, you see they have frets here. So there are so many frets, it's a more advantageous thing to have but the sarod doesn't have. Sarod has just a playing thing, you can say.

Yogi: Keyboard.

Shri Mataji: Keyboard, just a keyboard. And in the keyboard it's a very short distance also, very short distance but it has depth because of its bigger area to resound. But this one has such an advantage also and of the fingers too. With three fingers, playing with thumb and these two fingers he was playing, you see. And it's remarkable, such a device, I tell you. Now I hope all our people who are playing their guitars, like banjo, should now learn something from him. I think you better go to his guru and learn it from him or make him the guru.

May God bless you all. And for tabla Abhijith has definitely done masterly work today, I must say, masterly instruments. Now for the other people who have put in Mawa's music, the poetry which was superlative, the way it was rendered, the way it was composed and brought forward the depth of the feelings of the poet, it was really a very unique experience for Me. I'm sure you must have also all very much enjoyed. Now we have to put up a good show tomorrow, all right?

May God bless.
