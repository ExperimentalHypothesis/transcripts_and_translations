Letter about Dharma (also Pyramids and Tajmahal). London, 12 October 1976.

It is very true that some human beings in the prehistoric times were very wise and dynamic.Maybe they were realized but such people, in ancient civilization, must have been very much accepted as higher people. Otherwise how can you account for building a pyramid in Egypt, which is, from inside, all vibrated. (The human brain is also a "pyramid like" but not yet perfected. The proportions of Pyramid are Divine. (This is all supported by a scientist in his book on "the super nature" where he found that dead bodies do not decay).

There are many such instances.Specially artists who were of higher awareness (realized souls) were accepted and that is how the Tajmahal works (the dome gives resonance and there are lots of vibrations as the dome has a special shape). So these are no more make believes. They are all beyond the conception of even modern men. The reason for this acceptance comes from the fact that human beings at large, at that time, accepted virtue (the expression of Dharma) for the pattern of their life. They did not get "liberation" from virtue, socially or politically. Dharma was accepted as something to adhere to.

There must be clear-cut ideas as to the formal religions appropriated by people who "talk about God". They are not realized and those who are realized also are not fully aware of themselves. The talk about God leads to the rationalization of formal religions. The mythical organized religions have befooled human beings to such an extent that it looks like a joke, which has turned into a cold-blooded murder. I do not know whether to laugh or to be angry or to weep with anguish.

This is how I describe Dharma in short.Dharma is the sustenance of all things that are born or created. It is super nature that gives valences to atoms in an element. It is Dharma that is expressed as the quality of these elements. For instance, gold has a quality that it is untarnishable.The human beings are like perfected instruments, like computers. Of course, if their Dharma is in balance, they are the best receptors. You can understand that the divine awareness is like the main electrical current which starts the computer (Self-realization). If the Dharma in the instrument is lacking, self-realization does not give full results. It becomes like a second hand car. Dharma is the fulcrum and the one who is in Dharma never gets into imbalance. So the attention has to be on "Dharma", the point where the gravity of sin does not act.The information of Dharma comes from the Unconscious but the movement from the fulcrum can take the human attention so much in one dimension or so much like a seesaw that ultimately the beam of life tilts towards one side, either towards hell or towards destruction. Because, if the extreme movements are like a seesaw, the delicate flower of human awareness becomes confused and people suffer from all kind of diseases.

So what must we do? The human beings have to come to the state of Gautama who became the Buddha. He searched in all earnestness and honesty. He gave up first all fake worldly preoccupations. This is not required but when he gave up all hopes of searching (the occupation of the mind), he accepted his defeat. He felt tired and fell at the feet of the Holy Ghost. Buddha had dharma. His body was clean, His mind the attention, did not find any joy in the worldly greed or desire. His cup was ready and it emptied when he was tired and surrendered and that was the moment: like torrential rain, the "Shakti" filled His cup and made Him the "Shakta", the Enlightened One. So, when you are talking of virtue, you are warning them to keep the cup intact and clean.

Sahaja yoga is the proof of all the scriptures that are challenged. But I had to come to explain, to give realization and to tell you the "know how". In science first a hypothesis is propounded and then experimented. If we get the results, it becomes the scientific law. In the same way, so far, religions or ideas of God was a hypothesis but how this hypothesis becomes the law through sahaja yoga is to be seen.

Sahaja yoga is more concerned with the Mahalakshmi Power â€“ evolutionary power - which also integrates all the three powers at the point beyond the brahmarandra (top of the head). With this integration, the sahaja yoga discovery proves that the human being is a perfected instrument, a computer built in various period which, when put to the mains, starts giving information.It proves that all religions are living flowers on the tree of life and they describe the Truth. All Incarnations are "true". All this can be proven at the time of Kundalini awakening. It creates a human awareness, which can have a dialogue with the Unconscious.
