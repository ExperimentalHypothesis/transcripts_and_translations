New Year's Eve Talk. Chelsham Road Ashram, London (UK), 31 December 1981.

So the New Year is coming and it is due, accepted  [?? CP. It’s expected??] to be a very dynamic year for Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis. Everything new becomes stale and never becomes new again. So whatever has gone has gone. Let bygone be bygone. There have been very sweet memories sometimes, sometimes rather unhappy also. But on the whole we are growing, all of us are realising, coming up. You’ve done a good job of building up ourselves, into a new way. New Sahaja yogis have come up and I think now, have got rid of their lethargy and their petty-minded, their jealousies, their slyness, their slumber and narrow-mindedness. All these things have to be buried in the past. They are of no use to us. It’s a load we carry for nothing at all. 
Today it happens that I read a very nice letter which was lying with me which I didn’t read. It was sent by Gregoire to Warren. It really touched my heart.
He was concerned about the jealousies that people suffer and the way he said that, that this jealousy is the most petty stuff, a most ugly thing, and it comes up as something as a challenge to your love, challenge to your understanding or something like that, and then he started explaining it. This explanation is all rational. In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like jealousy. It doesn’t exist. It doesn’t exist in the Kingdom of God, something called jealousy, because all are part and parcel of one God. So, one person becomes important, another less important. It’s only for the time being. For example, when you are smelling a flower, naturally the nose is more active than the eyes. When you are seeing the flower, then the eyes are more active. So, it is not necessary that at this moment, when somebody is more active, doesn’t mean that he is closer to God and another person who is inactive is not, everybody is, but some people are active at a point, some people are active at another point. Or some people are closer, some people are a little away but they are all part and parcel. 
So this is one of the things one has to understand that there should be no jealousy. On the contrary, if you find somebody who is spiritually higher, you must try to understand and appreciate, especially a person who is wiser than you, somebody who speaks wise things. If you hear somebody saying something wise, try to notice, appreciate it, enjoy, you’ll like it.  Sometimes even the children say something nice, young people can say something nice. 

Shri Mataji aside : what’s happening to the people? Are they coming? From? They have still left their hire and dry. Were you to take their things for them?  Somebody had to go back, is it Thomas? Norman has gone? Where is Norman?  
Sahaja Yogi : All the people…either made their way here or to the hotel. 
Shri Mataji : About, you see, 6 people are left out. So we could have brought - 
Sahaja Yogi : …when you left. 
Shri Mataji : Yes. And they were trying- two of them tried to squeeze in our this thing, you see. One of them was Graham and this and that. But I told Graham to get down. I said these others are left out, so come with them. I don’t know. They might come by. 
Sahaja Yogi : Tube. We can phone them first before they-
Shri Mataji : Phone is- they are outside the house now. 
Sahaja Yogi : They are outside.
Shri Mataji : They could all come in. I mean I don’t know. 
Sahaja Yogini : It’s only about 25 minutes…Mother
Shri Mataji : I know that. But you see the habits, English habits are there, still lingering. 
Sahaja Yogi : Yes. They might stand there. We could go out and get the- 
Shri Mataji : Let’s wait for a while and see. Let us wait and see, you see. Let’s wait and see I hope you’ll get it. I hope you get the thing and come back. I told them to come together, all of them. They must be jumping until they’ll be here. Alright.

 
So the first thing is of jealousy which I don’t understand. Some of you think that I like someone more than the other. To be very frank, I have no idea of liking or disliking. I don’t understand that. There is no question. It’s a very different mechanism you are dealing with, you see. That person who doesn’t get involved into any, doesn’t get entangled into any. Only thing what I am trying to do is to disentangle you. If I was an entangling type, how can I disentangle? You see, if I was the person who has to purify you and if I am the person who cannot purify you, then what’s the use of My being there? So if the person who tries to purify, has to be pure himself. Supposing there’s a soap and the soap is the one that gets dirty. Then what’s the use of such a soap? In the same way I never get entangled with anyone. That’s my name, "Nirmama". To Me, "mama" [my] is not there, nobody is mine. Everybody is mine. So this should get out of your mind as to Nirmama. 

Shri Mataji aside : I think we’ll wait till 10, 10/15 minutes because Graham also I asked to get for those people and to bring them along. He’ll be able to do. 
Sahaja Yogi : We can go in the van Mother, cause they are not here. 
Shri Mataji: Just wait, just wait. You can give them about 20 minutes more.
Sahaja Yogi : Did they say there were expecting the van? 
Shri Mataji: No they did not. They’ll come. 

All right.
So we have to bury this useless thing called jealousy and it can be very serious thing. It can happen very seriously to people. I’ve seen people, they got jealous, then they got after another person, then they got after Sahaja Yoga, then after me. And this jealousy, one should not allow to crawl in you. You see, some people are more congenial, sometimes are more nearer Sahaja yoga, sometimes. They are more helpful. Sometimes they are more useful. Sometimes they have to be there. Sometimes they need Me the most of all. Some of them are lost people. Some of them are really possessed and badly off. So sometimes that’s why I look after them more. It’s My own whim. I cannot say. I cannot justify. Maybe that some person is very good. I look after, may be that some person is very bad, that’s why I look after. 

So one should never have any jealousy [?]  only must have understanding that your Mother has to work for all of you and has to improve you, cure you, do something about it. One thing we have to bury is the jealousy that lives within us. We bury something and something comes out very well, and what is that comes out of this jealousy? Is that we have to better ourselves so that the outgoing jealousy should leave within us. “Oh, am I jealous of a person? Then what’s good in that person? Let’s see.”

Now, this is not outward.  Sahaja is not outward.  If that person is outwardly like this, outwardly, it goes inward.  If I correct somebody, I correct that person because  the vibrations of that person are not all right.  You see that person can be extremely sweet also, a very sweet type, could be anything, could be  harsh, could be anything, but the vibrations of that person have to be all right.  I have to gain nothing out of you except that your vibrations should be correct.

So, you should not have any misidentification that some people are very dynamic, so they think they can do what they like.  Some people think they are very sort of deceiving type so they think they can do what they like.  All of this.  First of all you should speak collective.
  
 
For a mother if some children are left behind, her heart, all the time she thinks they are left behind.  They should.  That's the main thing.  This is not for one person.  Like just thinking about your own son or  thinking about  your own wife, thinking about your own husband.  It's not the point.  All of you are dearer to Me, dearest to Me, but I belong to no one.  I'm a hopeless case.  Just hear me up.  I belong to no one.  No one can possess me.  I cannot possess myself.  How can you possess?  I am beyond possession.  Then if it is so, there should be no jealousy. There's no question of jealousy or in any way feeling jealous of each other.  Only the beauty of enjoying others.     Somebody has some great points - very good qualities in that person - you'll imbibe it.  In Sahaja Yoga, whatever you enjoy you imbibe.  You know that.  Whatever you enjoy you will imbibe, just like that.  You should be able to enjoy.  

Now supposing you enjoy creating rifts in people, creating problems with people, you'll have them yourself.  Supposing you enjoy saying harsh things to others, you'll imbibe that in the sense that you will have more of it.  Whatever you want, you will have.  Christ has said if you want gold, you'll have gold.  Many people who came to Sahaja Yoga went away in the search of money, promotions and they got it.  You'll have gold.  

But those who are dearer to Me, will have, will sit with Me on My throne.  This is what you should ask for.  This is what you ask for.  Not for having more gold, more money, more this, more that, but that you are part and parcel of his company.  Now somehow, I know everyone of you.  Somehow, I don't know how, I know everyone of you.  How far you are with me, I know.  There is no need to justify.  No need to say, "This is not so.  That is not so".  I know everything.  I should know.  Otherwise, how would I give you something substantial?  I have to give you something very special and for that I have to know what you need, when I know I love you.  Unless until you love someone, you cannot know so much about the person.  I know your beauties.  I also  know your ugliness.  I know your tenderness.  I know your harshness.  I know all the things that you have, that you have been, that you are, and you will be.  It is many-dimensional knowledge.  

Some of you I expect it is too much  because I think you are capable and I know your past.  I work very hard on you.  You know that and I'll work and I'll continue to work, every year, but '82 is a very remarkable year, where you people should now work hard for Sahaja Yoga.  I have already given some idea as to how to work it with Raveen.  I have  talked to him.  Raveen knows how we are going to work it out in a systematic way, how to attack a particular village, or a particular district, or wherever you have to go, how to go there, how to propagate, how to establish.   

Wherever there is soft ground you should settle down, not in the hard ground.  The hard ground will never yield any produce.  So don't go on working on a hard ground.  Put your attention to these factors.  What can I do for Sahaja Yoga?  Take out your attention from yourself.  For example, supposing a person, now there are presents all being tied up.  Supposing a person wanted a particular present, take it like that.  Sahaja Yogis are not that low type but still, supposing take the lowest of lowest, behave like children.  So, you don't get that particular one.  

Now, to do all this with all the work I've been doing here, select that and to arrange all that, isn't it tremendous?  So, whatever Mother could do in that hurry and scurry, with everybody's name and all that, it is quite a lot to be done, and if She has done that, one should appreciate the love that Mother wants to bestow upon you.  It is all symbolic.  But somebody can sit down and start saying, "Oh, I should have had this.  Why didn't you give me this?  Why didn't you give me that.  I should have."  

You see, it is not anything that one has made or anything, just to give somebody something, in a small way, I am saying, but even in this small way, you are worried about yourself.  You have to worry about Sahaja Yoga.  What's going to happen to Sahaja Yoga?   How is it going to come up?  What have you to work it out?  What do you have to do?  How many pujas do we have to arrange?  How do we have to do anything?  Not about yourself.   How should I improve myself?  That point is also.  Forget it.  What are we going to do to propagate Sahaja Yoga, we have to say.   Not go to personal life, my husband and wife quarrelling, with them.   I mean, I've had enough of it. I mean, I'm not here to settle your marriages.  All these nonsensical things, you forget now.  Of course, if you have a good marriage, it helps Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.  It helps because you get children.  It helps.  If the husband and wife are not all right, you might get very horrible children which may be possessed from the very childhood and be very difficult.  They will be realised souls but will be very difficult children. 

So this is important that we should dedicate ourselves to Sahaja Yoga today, to bring out the old and bring out the new which is dedicated to Sahaja Yoga - not to your personal life, not your personal likes and dislikes, what will happen to Sahaja Yoga - and to be sincere about it.  Many people who organise go off their heads.  I've seen it.   Somehow, you give them something to organise, they are about to land up in a lunatic asylum.  You give them something to organise, make them the leader, finished.  It happens like that.  It goes off their head somehow or other.  You see, there is a crack in the head, and these, so the cracked head then starts behaving in such a funny manner, that you can't imagine how far one can go.  You have to organise, you have to become right-sided, you have to work hard, no doubt, but you need not be right-sided.  If you work with right hand you don't become right-sided, do you? You don't double up your ears, nose or (mantra?).  Do we?  Or you don't.  I mean, really, the nature, it keeps the body all right, I must say, because there is some right-handed people should have a right side, emotions.  Or the left hand should have a left-hand development.  Should be there, but it is not.  It keeps nature all right.  Nature keeps the faith all right, everything all right.  It keeps it.  

So one has to know that when you are trying to bring in something new, you must talk of the new.  Then whatever is old and outward should be sent away, should be thrown out.  Otherwise you will never grow.  It will shift from here to here, here to here, the bhoot particles.  

So today's message of not feeling guilty and not thinking of what all old things, old rags you have had on, throw it away, same day. You see, obstinacy should not be there.  People are very obstinate.  They don't want to see.  They don't want to forget.  They don't want to forgive.  Give up that obstinacy.  Obstinacy is not the nature of your spirit.  If you are the  spirit you will never be obstinate.  Have you ever seen Me being obstinate?  Ever?  You said, "Mother, sit here."  "All right".  You say, "Sit there."   "All right".  No, not that I am going to sit here alone.  Never, never.  You say, "Mother, will you eat this?"  "All right,"  even if I am very, very full myself.  Sometimes I should put down My foot but I don't.  So you should also not be at all obstinate.  There should be not obstinacy.  There should be no fanatics.  It's all a play going on, this way, that way, that way.  Just enjoy yourself.  So this is one thing, if you are obstinate, you cannot become a new person.  To become a new person you have to give up your obstinacy completely.  Once you give up your obstinacy you will be very happy and peaceful, and you must come as a new person every minute, every second you are.  So I just.  

Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned in England, I think it has taken a good road.  Propagation has to be established.  It has to be publicised.  It has to be talked about.  People are to be told you have found it.  Go and see people who are seekers.  Whatever level you are, supposing you are dealing with a particular type, of say a lawyer,  should meet all the lawyers.  If there's a psychologist is there, should go and see the psychologist.  At your level, whatever level it is, you should go and talk about it to others that this is what you have found out.  Why don't you get hold of it, and you will all get good quality people who are really seekers?  You must talk now and that is what is.  Get out of your shyness.  That is very important to get out of your shyness.  Talk to people.  But I've seen people when they talk about Sahaja Yoga, instead of giving a good name to Sahaja Yoga, they bring bad name, because when they talk, they talk in such a way as if they are being clever.  That's not good.  We have to say we are just the same.  We are just the old egg and we are just trying to talk because we have found something, so others are not hurt.  

So for that you have to remember the past that we were like this, and if somebody had talked to us, like this, they would have been hurt.  We have to remember our past, remembering the past, just for your own manoeuvring, that's all.  Not that as a part and parcel but just for your manoeuvring, how to deal with others.  Unless until you remember your past, you will not know how to deal with others and you won't have compassion.  So that is what we have to see, the importance of the past.

The future at this present moment is that '82 is a great year, that's all, not more than that.  You don't have to think about '83 because even if you start doing it in '83,'82 will be silent.  "You do it in '83, Mother.  What does it mean? I think I believe it would be a better idea to do this in '83.  What do you think, Mother?"  Suggestions.   I have a  suggestion  today.  Supposing we do it in '83, why not today?  Why not now?  Ask the question, "Why not?"  When such a thing is done, why not now?  And then whatever you do, you do it fully, completely to the finishing point.  Like (Pais ?) has been very good with you when we were working in that house.  You were chiselling the house and I was chiselling  you.  You were building the house and I was building you.  It was very good, interesting, very nice.  Some of you have really gained a lot, really gained a lot.  You have really become very dynamic, very beautiful, very Sahaja.  Quite a lot of you done that.  I  know that and it is really very appreciative, work that you have done.  Anybody can see that very clearly.  

You are being described by Blake that you will be the golden builders.  Clearly, this is done by the golden bridges, but in that you have to learn first.  Like now they are painting, all right.  The painter goes up to paint.  He takes a place to sit down on top.  When he comes out everything is there, all the mismanagement that was done is still there.  The painter has finished the painting.  Still the scaffolding is there, the seat is there, the things on which he was sitting, the cushion is there, all these piers that were removed that are there, all the carpets are there, are just the same.  It takes hardly ten minutes to put it right. 

So this is the future.  The future is that when you do something, feel, be that futuristic seed of that person.  See that the state in the seed again.  You give realisation to somebody.  See that it is fixed.  So remember the past for your manoeuvring and remember the future for feeling so it is not lost in the future.  This is importance of making the spirit.  Experience of the back or the past should give you manoeuvring, in the sense that at that moment you must do something in the present.  You must compensate, in the sense that at that moment you must do something in the present. You must compensate, in the sense that at that moment you must do something by which the future is not giving.  This is how New Year's celebration should be.  '82 is important.  In '82 whatever we have learned from the past, we remember.  We'll not do the same mistake.  Not only but also, remember whatever past has taught us.  We'll  have compassion for the people who have been like that.   We'll have love for them.  We'll have understanding.  We'll do whatever is possible to bring them round.  We'll have concern, need not just Sahaja Yogis, you see, sweet-talking Sahaja Yogis, but we'll do something about it.  

So many are lost in intellectual pursuits.  So many are lost in financial pursuits.  So many are lost in political pursuits and so many are lost in so-called service pursuits.  All of them belong to some category and you have to belong  to one of these categories.  So you have to think of them, try to bring them out, do something about it, have a wider standing.  

When you have a small personalty, think of your wife, yourself, nothing more than that or your children at the most.  But when you are a wider personality you just think what will happen to the people who belong to this clan, who belong to Catholicism, those who belong to Judaism, those who belong to Methodist and to Jainism. Saint  Michael, like that, have a wider  personality.  Don't worry about yourself.  I've known people who'll  come and ask, "Mother, where should I find my keys?  Mother, where should I put my basket?  Mother, where should I put my nose?  What should I do about my luggage?  What should I do about my travelling?"  All nonsensical things, they'll come and ask.  I'm not here to give you all that. Every small thing they will ask.   Now if you tell them, "Why are you doing it?"  you said it.  I didn't say it that you ask Me every time you have to raise a finger. "Mother, may I rise my finger.  May I close my eyes?  May I smile?"  Not that.  You are people, in My eyes are saints.  So decide for yourself, of course.  You are saints.  You have to assume.  You don't know you are saints.  Assume you are saints.  This assumption must come to you, on this great auspicious day that you are saints, and saints have to  be wise people and do it by themselves, because they are saints.  If they  fight, quarrel among themselves, then  this is stupidity, absolute stupidity, against the whole.  Sahaja Yoga is here to solve the problems of others. What am I to tell you anything?  You are saints, that's all I say, care.  If you ask Me any questions, answer is you are saints.  Do what you like.  Whatever you want you will have.  Whatever you say it will happen.  Whatever you ask for it will happen.  Whatever you imagine it will work out, but if you imagine something good and say something good and do something that is divine, you are so great.  You are made like that.  You are that.  Assume.  Assume that power that you are a saint.  How can you say something nonsensical?  Nirmala Vidya is at your disposal, at your complete, I would say, in fact, Nirmala Vidya, nobody had it except for you Sahaja Yogis have.  Nobody had even the, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, never even had it.  Can you believe?  They had their own powers but you have Nirmala Vidya and now what do you want more and then you ask me, "Mother, should I ring?" or whether, "Should I smile?"  This is (?).  

First of all you believe in yourself and then it will work out.  Behave in a confident manner, in a proper way, and if I say anything, do not start going into confusion, something like that.  Just understand that what your Mother is saying is not for Me, for others, maybe, and if it is for Me I should correct Myself.  Simple thing.  If it is for others, why should I worry?  If it is for Me, thank them very much and I must correct Myself.  It's as simple as that. 

A day should come when I don’t have to talk, you have to talk. I should say so that I should listen to all your wise talk as I listen to children when they tell me something, there are so wise you see. In the same way I would like to listen to you, talking all wise things, nice things about each other, loving, not frightened of anyone, very happy with each other, behaving like great gentlemen and great gentle ladies, and be very much in love with each other, looking after each other, not to be sullen and sulking and stupid faces, but charming – charm, I won’t use the word because charming can be horrible, I’ve heard that before [Shri Mataji laughs] I would say - but faces that are lit up with joy, happiness and of [dignity?]. Such people I want to see. Such people you should be, loving, affectionate, good people, smiling, that should be so, that is what is Sahaja Yoga. Those who do not want to join in are absolutely free to go, actually, they are thrown out. So, to stick onto Sahaja Yoga is difficult. It is better to understand that, to be a Sahaja Yogi is a difficult thing, to be a non Sahaja Yogi is the easiest. 
So this is what you have been seeking, which you’ve got, which you are, you should assume it, and be happy and joyous and do not upset others, do not disturb others, don’t say harsh things because Nirmala Vidya stops at the left Vishudhi.  Be kind to others and understand. If you need any correction I am there to tell you. Up to a point, I’ll tell, after some time, I’ll not say. Once the children are grown up, mother doesn’t say anything. She just sits down and watches the beauty of her children who are so grown up, so mature, so beautiful. 
I hope that time will come in my lifetime and I will be able to see such beautiful people around, that they will- they have grown up, they understand how to behave, and how to be nice and good. 
So for today’s New Year, let us vow within ourselves, that the selfishness or the self-centeredness of the smallest in you is finished. Now the drop has become the ocean. Live like an ocean and like a lion. Don’t roar at others and be generous and don’t be afraid of anything. Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of. Sometimes you might feel you are let down, sometimes you’ll feel “oh this should have happened.” Do not desire for anything. Whatever you desire is not correct, that’s all. 
If the desire is correct and it’s deserving, it will happen, hundred per cent. 
So all the best, and the greatest year, and happiness and joy. Feel your responsibility, understand each other. And now I’m going. Tomorrow I will be gone, so-called. [Every one laughs]

Don't worry about anything else but worry about Sahaja Yoga.  That has to be established all over the world.  Very great work one has done, of course. I mean, you can't say, one has done as much one can do, but you can do much more.  You can become really dynamic and you can do it.  Try to think of ways and methods of doing it.  May God bless you.  So now with all these dreams and blues, should we start giving presents now.
