[16:43] 

On behalf of all of us Sahaja Yogis, I thank Shri Kadkade, Shri Byankar and their colleagues from the bottom of My heart. [Sahaja Yogis applaud] And with such beautiful singing, and even more subtle words, they have so moved Me that I feel like meditating. Seeing such young artists in our Maharashtra, I feel that this great knowledge, which has come down through tradition, will at least be preserved in Maharashtra.

[18:01] 

All Sahaja Yogis, I have already said, must understand classical music. Because this is Omkara. And when you listen to its rhythm, vibrations automatically start flowing. And it is so effective in your Kundalini. It all happens very easily. Not only that, but wherever Sahaja Yogis [are] abroad, today there are sixteen countries, everywhere I tell them that we should all learn classical music and all the people have made a full effort to learn that music. Not only that, but without understanding it, because it is the music of the soul, they all become immersed. Similarly, today, as many Sahaja Yogis as there are in India, they should fully embrace their classical music because it is the matter of My heart. This is the form of the soul which is flowing in a manifest form. All artists should be respected and this art should be respected. Music is of the highest standard in all art. So without making any kind of criticism, one should understand it with respect. So, Sahaja Yoga will become very Sahaj [spontaneous], even for Me.

[19:43] 

Anyway. [Shri Mataji smiles] We are very grateful to you for making us all engrossed today. [Sahajayogis applaud]. Yesterday I thanked all the groups of Nagpur on Our behalf and today I am also very grateful to them for coming back and showcasing their art here. [Sahajayogis applaud]. Apart from that, Chittibabu, who is coming from South India tomorrow, has a special message that “Mother, I must play in front of you”, he has come and we should understand his music too. It is of a very high standard. In this way, if we leave the hostility and understand the essence of all music as we have said, then the soul in it always makes us happy. Tomorrow all the Sahajayogis must definitely come. I will not accept anyone who says that because it is South Indian music, we will not come. Listen to it once and you will be surprised how much art there is in that. And how engrossing it is. Apart from that, our Dhakde Guruji will also play the violin for about an hour tomorrow and will enchant us again. [Applause].

[21:33] 

I also invite you all tomorrow, that please everyone should come and listen to that music and understand it. We can become the masters of our music and become masters of their music too. Their, what we call the Taana, or their Alaps, their style, just like you took the Punjabi style, took the Banarasi style in Maharashtra, similarly if you take a little Madrasi style, there is no problem. And it is very beautiful. In this way we can get a completeness, and we can become proficient in it.

So tomorrow, all the Sahaja Yogs, wherever they are, must come tomorrow. It should be understood that tomorrow is a special program. They have come from all this distance, from Madras, to enhance the prestige of your mother, they are very famous in the world. Therefore, you all should come and respect them.

[22:41] 

You all have come for so many days for my birthday, for four days no one considers birthday [Shri Mataji laughs], but for four days My birthday is still going on, you have taken so much trouble, and you have shown so much love from your heart, seeing that, a Mother's eyes just fill with tears. And what can I say further?

My infinite blessings to everyone.

Note: The song in the start of the video is Kaivalyacha chandyala bhukela chakor

Lyrics:

Kaivalyachya chandanyala bhukela chakor

Chandra vha ho panduranga, man kara thor

Baalvayi kheli ramalo, tarunya naasale

Vruddhapani deva aata dise pailtir

Janmamaran nako ata,nako yerjhar

Nako aihikacha natha vyarth badivaar

Charachara paar nya ho jahla ushir

Pandurang, pandurang... Man kara thor

Translation

The bird chakor* is hungry for the moon of Kaivalya (liberation)

Become the moon, Panduranga, make my mind great

In childhood, I enjoyed playing, my youth has passed

In old age, God now appears beyond.

No more birth and death, no more wandering

No more worldly pleasures, no more vain pursuits

Take me beyond the worldy things, it is late

Panduranga Panduranga .. make my mind great

*Chakor bird is used to depict spiritual seekers' yearning, representing longing for divine truth and fulfillment.
