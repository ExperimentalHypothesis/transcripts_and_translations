 Easter Puja Sunday, 8th A pril 2007, Pratishthan, India Pravachan of H.H. Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi everything will be worked out; it has worked out with so many of you and it will wark out with others also. Shri Mataji : "Today is a very important day. This is a new starting for you, for you all. Try to understand that you have worked very hard so far, and you wanted to do much more than you would have been able to do. That was your desire and it will work out definitely it will work out, If your desire is strong, things will work out, and you'll get a great chance of helping people as you have had help yourself, and you were happy about it. It's not just a talk but there's something happening; so try to remember that you are all Sahaja Yogis, and you deserve a very good help, very good help from Me and from God Almighty.; There is nothing to be upset. These are all different tests which will work out the goodness in you, and they'll get the results: you'll find Sahaja Yogis special ones. It's better that you decide to help others. It's important they all should be blessed. You can do it. There lies your leadership, that you have to give it to others. Most of you have got it for yourself, but you have to give it to others. Let the others also gain in their spirituality. I know so many of you have got your Realisation and you are so much in it, and you are all very happy, so be happy and cheerful. That is the first sign that you are realised, you have got the Realisation. With this Realisation you can give Realisation to others. It's very nice to see so many of you who have tried to get Realisation, but who are really already realised. There are many who want to have Realisation, but there are already many who are already realised and who can do a lot for others who want their help. Today is a good day when you have to decide for your future. You have to decide that you are going to help other Sahaja Yogis to get more Sahaja Yogis, and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga. You see so many problems are there, and the more we have as Sahaja Yogis, there's no problem left, it will be all solved. The speciality of today is that Christ came back to life just to do something for us, so it's very important day for all of us. I would say that today you should understand that you have got this power to give Realisation to others. You have got it, but now you have to use. Those who have Self Realisation should not waste their energy, but try to give it. Sol wish you luck that please, try to get your Realisation proper and confirmed.I hope you don't have doubts about it. If you have any doubts you can write to Me. Now we have got some very nice, This world is full of chaos, and quarrels and fighting still going on, so your duty and your job will be to talk to them and tell them that, first important thing, Sahaja Yogis must become peaceful, and they must enjoy the fruits of Sahaja Yoga. I am sure good people who have come to Sahaja Yoga, so it is your own duty to see that they become good Sahaja Yogis and enjoy the blessings. I am very happy to see so many of

 The Divine Cool Breeze Issue: 7 & 8 - 2007 you coming; and today is for Me a very good day also. In the life of Christ a very great thing happened, that He became, He became what He was already, a Sahaja Yogi, and He tried to make many Sahaja Yogis if possible, but at that time the people were not so alert as you are. You are special people who are seeking and who have found out, and you can give it to others. This is not for keeping with yourself. If you have got it, just don't think that you have got the last chance, but give chance to others. The official video ends here but just after the talk ended and before the present giving, Shri Mataji also said the following: "Once you have got Self Realisation you have to give it to others and respect it, that is important to respect it. I am sure it will work out; and you all look so good to Me and I am sure that all of you will do it. I have not been able to finish anything I have started and I have to work hard to pull others out so they can see their value." I am all with you, and if any of you (Transcription carefully verified with have any personal or any other problem, you should write to Me. the video recording.) (The Light of Sahaja Yoga) I am sorry I won't be able to give you anything for this special day. 5th May 2007 May God bless you all." (Contd. From Page- 33) in this face. Whatever is inside is expressed outside. If you are not genuine, it shows outside. That is why the inside light should be made a big, brilliant light so that we can disciples being blessed by the Holy Ghost and all of them had light coming out of their heads. These were so few, but you are so many and all of you have got light on your head, which is guiding you, which is looking after you, which is loving you, which is showing you the path. You should never feel that you are alone, but try to keep yourself clean. Because this light can disappear. make people see reality in so many lights. I'm sure they can see that -- the beauty on your faces. In Rome when you people were singing, one old man came and said that I can see the light on their faces. And you can see, there's a picture that there's light upon everybody's head here. The other day I saw one painting done by El Greco, Christ's May God bless you. (DCB-June-1988)

 Shri Adishakti Puja Cabella 6-6-93 Pravachan of H.H.Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi "What is Adishakti" pure love, So think of a father who has put all his love into one personality, then what is left in Him is Nothing. He is just watching. What does He think? He is just watching the play of His desire, of His love. He is watching it, how it is working out. And when he is watching that then he is very careful because he knows that this personality that I have created is nothing but love and compassion3B and compassion itself is such a noble variety that it cannot bear anybody challenging that compassion, troubling that compassion or also in any way demeaning it, lowering it, or insulting it. He is so alert on that point and he is very watchful. So a rift has taken place, you should say, from him, from his own desire of love. Today you are all going to worship Me first time. It has always been puja of an aspect of Me or a part of Me. Now one has to know very clearly, what is Adishakti? As you say it is the Pure desire of God almighty, of Sadashiva. But what is the pure desire of GodAlmighty? If you see, your own desires come out of what? Not of the Divine Love, but out of carnal love, out of material love or out of love for power. Behind all these desires there is Love. If you do not love something you will not desire it. So these mundane type of loves that you have for which you spend so much of a time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction because that is not true love that you have; just infatuation for the time being and then you just get fed up with it and then you jump to another thing, to another thing and to another thing. Now this desire of love was also aiven a personality, means ego, and that this ego has to act on its own. It became, sort of, a very independent personality which was free to do whatever it liked. And we cannot So Adishakti is embodiment of God's Divine Love; is God's Pure Love and in His love what did He desire? He desired that he should create human beings who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like Angels; and that was His idea is to create Adam and Eve. So Angels have no freedom, Angels are made like that. They are fixed, they do not know why they do it! Animals also do not know why they do certain things; they just do it, because they are bound by nature. They are bound by God Almighty. They say Shiva is Pashupati, means He controls all the animals. He is Pashupati. He controls all the animals. So all the desires from animals come in but they do not repent, they do not have ego, they do not think that this is wrong or that is good. They have no Karma problem because They have no ego, because they have no freedom. think in our mundane life that a husband and wife are absolutely free to do what they like, because there is no cohesion, there is no understanding there is not that oneness, that rapport. But it is like a moon and moonlight, sun and sunlight. It is such a cohesion that whatever one does, another enjoys. In that beautiful rift Adishakti decided to change His plans. She is known "Sankapvikalp Karoti"; anything you try to decide too much, she will make it different, like today's 11 O'clock Puja. So when this Adam and Eve business started She thought that they will be just like other animals or Angels. What is the use? They must know what they are doing, they must know why they are doing. They must have the freedom to understand what is the for Her knowiedge and like fixed machine like life, At this point Adishakti, which was

 - 2007 6. Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze about Dharma, about ascent. But in India people talked about Kundalini since long and that She is the Adishakti, reflected within us. Now, you see it is already read it out to you that I will be in everyone of them. Now understand this the Adishakti is the Power of Love-of Pure Love-of compassion. There is nothing else She has, only the pure love within her heart. But this pure love is so powerful, is so powerful, that is the love She has given to this Mother Earth. Because of that this Mother Earth, the amount of sins we may commit, we may do anything, She is pouring out Her love through these beautiful things to all of us. They have also this beauty expressed in every way, of her love through the galaxies you see, these stars you see. Now if you want to see from a scientific way, then science means which has no love in it. There is no question of love. Even people talk of Yoga, but they don't talk of love and compassin. that these animals are having, why would they have? So in Her arbitrary power which was conceded, of course, She is the one who came as a serpent and told them that you taste the Fruit of Knowledge. Now for people who are not Sahaja Yogis you cannot tell this. They will be shocked. But this serpent that came for them to tempt and then to tell them that you better taste this fruit, this serpent told the woman, not the man, because woman is supposed to accept things easily. She may even accept bhoots, she may even accept nonsense but she is the one who accepts. While the man does not accept easily. He argues, he discusses, that is why She came and told the woman. She came and told woman, should say. This Holy Ghost actually is a feminine and so more nearer to a woman. This feminine Ghost came as a serpent and told that better you taste the Fruit of Knowledge. Now it was the job of the lady Eve to convince her husband because women know how to do that. Sometimes When there is no love and compassion there cannot be any Divine's Power in that person. Everything is completely submerged in this Divine Love. Everything that is created on this earth, 'everything that is created in this universe and universes and universes, is all because of the Love of the Divine Mother. So this Adishakti's love is something so subtle, is so subtle, you cannot understand sometimes. I know you all love Me very much, tremendous love for Me, and whenl get the vibrations from you, it is like the ripples that reach the shores and again they return back and lots of little little sparkling drops are there on the shores also. In the same way, in my heart, I feel your love echoing the beauty of this sparkled Divine love. I cannot explain to you the experience what it creates but the first thing that it creates, is that tears come into my eyes. Because it is the compassion, which is 'Sandra Karuna' is they may convince them wrongly, tell them something which is very wrong, very sinister, as you know, in Macbeth what happened? So many places, we have seen, women have misguided their husbands. But men can be misguided or could be guided or could be emancipated, if they have a proper wife, So he had all faith in his wife, believed in it and they tasted the Fruit of Knowledge under the guidance of this Holy Ghost who was a feminine personality of God. This cannot be conceived by the people who are just getting a glimpse of Christ or a glimpse of Mohammad Sahib or a glimpse of Nanak Sahib. They cannot understand. They just had a glimpse of them. If they had told, people would have said, Woh! What is this? They would have never listened to them. So at that time, the way the attention was, the way the reception was, they told

 Issue: 7 & 8 7 -2007 The Divine Cool Breeze of benevolence in their heart. So the first thing that is achieved through this Divine Love is your benevolence. The benevolence itself is also a kind of a very misguided word. Benevolence means whatever is good for your spirit. Now as you know the spirit is the reflection of God Almightly; so when the spirit in you starts reflecting itself in its full beauty then you become the giver, you are no more a person who has to take anything, you just become the giver. You are so fulfilled. Now this Advent came at a time which was judged what time it should come. As I said you have freedom, people were going amuck doing all kinds of things. So if you see that just before this we had a big problem of people working out their power, like people will go to India to occupy the territory of India, or to China or besides they went up to Africa and all these places. Even Americans went to, so called Americans, went to America and occupied it. 'Ardra', it is not dry. Like a father's compassion could be very dry; alright, do this, otherwise I will shoot you, I will do this. Mother will say, but she won't say something that will be that hurting. She will have to say sometimes to correct you but her saying is very different from the father's, because she has got Sandra Karuna. Ardra, 'Ardra' is which is not dry. This kind of a heart She developed because of the Divine Love that She was having. So every part of the body, everything is created out of Divine Love. Every bit of it emits nothing but Divine Love. Vibrations are nothing but Divine Love. Now as I have told you before also that this incarnation had to come. The time had come. It was all being seen that the time has come. But there is a difference between fixed time and the time which is Sahaja. Fixed time is such that, you can say that, this train will leave of this time, it will reach this time. You can say that some machinery is producing something, in such time it will produce so many things. But living things which are spontaneous, which are Sahaja, you cannot see time. In the same way this process of freedom. You have the maximum freedom. So one could not say what time this will happen, that people will be available to receive this subtle knowledge of Divine Love. Knowledge also could be very dry. We had terrible people in India who were busy with the reading and with the recitation of mantras, this, that and they became so dry- so dry that just bone structures left and so hot tempered that they looked at anybody and that person will become into ashes.I mean, is this the way you have come on this earth to do all the tapasayas and everything just to make somebody into ashes? But that's how they thought that they were very great because they looked at somebody and that person disappears or becomes ashes (Bhasmisat, they call it) There was no idea So this was the time when they were using their freedom for power only. That was not the time for the Adishakti to be born. They were the people who were power oriented3B not that today we do not have, we have, but these were seeking only power and also these territories. It is not important. So it could not be at that time. At that time, one had to fight for your freedom, for getting out of the clutches of these imperialists and people who were trying to overpower. Now gradually it changed. It changed and changed in such a smooth way! It is very surprising! I saw the change coming up myself. It worked out, as you know thatI myself took part in the freedom movement of India. It is important. In India it started, first the freedom from imperialism and then gradually this freedom from imperialism started spreading in every country. People started thinking about the freedom; they

 Issue: 7 & 8 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze been wasted on these people, Divine love would have been a waste, because mentally people were not prepared to understand. You could not teil them that this is absolutely out of your blindness, ignorance, you are doing this. This is not the right thing for you. This will not make you noble. This is ignoble. You have been ignoble this, Of course, so many saints came, they talked of nobility, of foregiveness, of unity, of oneness, everything they said. Big seers were born. They also reached that point, talked about it. But still people were not prepared so much. Gradually, I think their teachings and all that started working into them. started understanding that there is no use having colonies and all that, better come back to your own positions. So when this happened, I mean this happened in my own life time, I must say; first people who tried to have freedom in our country died. So many were killed; you know, we have people like Bhagat Singh, in every country. All the revolutionaries were thrown out and ill- treated and killed. It is not a question of Independence. But that one had to go through, so that, freedom was tested. Now they thought that this was nonsensical thing we did. This was no freedom because after all doing all that they started repenting and developing a kind of fear and a fright from others and a kind of a very disturbed left Vishudhi started. They felt very guilty, that they have done very wrong. That they should not have done. But the biggest problem is with these so called religions that they started. All these religions got derailed and they formed a kind of puddings, Muslims here, Christians here, Hindus there. This is this, this is that. So you really needed this river of life to fill up all these puddles and make them one. It is complete ignorance. It is sheer stupidity to think that one human being is higher than another. You can only say one thing that at a different state you are, some are at a different state, some are at a higher state, but in general you cannot condemn somebody that he is no good, this society is not good. In general, individually you can say. In general you cannot say. But this ignorance was so dark because it became collective, it is a collective ignorance-collective ignorance. They all joined hands together collectivily to say that this is the religion that is the best, we are only the ones who have saved ones. Another said no, no, no, no, no, these are absolutely condemned people, we are the best; and under the name of religion, under the name of God Almighty, they started this nonsense. So now Adishakti had to assert with the complete force. So the first thing She realised that one should know what is a family. A child grows in the family. If the At this juncture also there were other problems, like we had caste system and other problems like slavery and all kinds of things-disparities and some people were treated as lower people and some as higher people, some higher races, some lower races. All these stupid things were there. Through their freedom they created, through their freedom. It is not so, it is not the fact, it is not the truth but they created the things like that. Now supposing I want to create something here just to say that alright, this is not a carpet, go on telling you this is not a carpet, this is not a carpet. The brain is washed, you see that this is not a carpet. It is something else. It is like a mesmeric thing I feel the way people accepted this nonsense of racialism, of all kinds of disparities, of slavery, of caste system and specially ill treating women. All this came out of the choice that was given to them to select what is good, what is bad. So to them it was very good, it was a nice thing to do. Under these circumstances compassion would have

 Issue: 7 & 8 - 2007 9. The Divine Cool Breeze of economic reasons and things like that. So now at this time, when we see this very crucial time, it was, when the people had to know love and the family had started breaking in every country, specially western countries, where men and women never realised the importance of family life. They never had faith in their family, So it became such a shifty thing for the poor children. They were on shifty grounds. They could not grow properly, So it created a generation of violent, horribly possessed children. This generation then, went into warmongering. They don't children do not get the proper attention from the father or the mother, we can say, if they are also spoiled or if not spoiled if they are over indulged into or they are neglected, then the child does not know what love is. If a child does not know what love is, love does not mean that you spoil the child or you give him lots of toys to play and get rid of him. It means that all the time your attention is on your child and that attention is not indulgence but an attention for the benevolence of the child. So all the time you know-they feel like fighting. I have seen are seeing that there is benevolence and thus I thought the family life has to be first of all substantiated. Very important; because these days also under the name of religion they have started nunneries and then priests and then sanyasis and all kinds of 'babas' take it. Detest it. You try, out of your are there. They are so dry and they are so misleading the people that people started taking to this kind of sanyasa, getting out of their houses, getting away from their wives and children. So the first point I realised, human beings cannot have love, who have not known what is love is; and this love is more effective if it is collective. See we must have seen that in India people really love each other in a family. I mean in so many relations we do not know how we are realted to them! We just call them brothers, sisters, this, that. We do not know what is the relationship, whose father or whose sister, nothing, but we just feel this is our brother and if you ask how he is your brother, you do not know how he is your brother. The reason is we had joint family system. children fighting with the trees. I said why are you fighting? It is nice to fight, you know. But why are you fighting? They do not know. The reason, there is no love. So everything that you see, you detest. I don't like it, I don't frustration, to destroy anything that is there. So a new trend started, apart from the war when it was over, naturally the value system dropped down. People felt what is the use, you see. We had all these values so what did we get? Warl And what is the war for? War has just killed all our society and killed our children, everybody and what is great about the war system? So the mind of the people, on the whole, was that somehow or other you must fight, that the fittest man is the best. So the one who can dominate, the one who can come up, is the best. So the domination of these imperial style of Govt. was over but individually it became a process of domination. With this process of domination, ego started developing. Even to children they used to give education in such a way that children became very arrogant, very artificial, extremely arrogant and artificial. It was impossible to understand why these children were not at all controlled, were told that this is wrong! Because the parents also took a very very different. .attitude. The Joint family system is just like a collective system. So nobody knew who was his real brother, who was his step brother, who was his cousin, nothing. That all lived together as just relations. But then this also brake, this joint family also broke because

 - 2007 10 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze They wouldn't feel their children and tell them what is wrong. They were so attached to their idea that these children will leave us, that they said "do whatever you like but still ." Under these circumstances even human beings as such were (devided) between a good family life and divorces and the funny society which believes in sharing women and sharing men and all kinds of things. So what a terrible situation was there for Adishakti to assert Herself! Then, also there was very big problem about the religions asserting themselves, their own ideas, their own conditionings on people and absolutely blinding. trying to control them. That made me feel really think that now I better stop worrying as to what the atmosphere is, worrying as to what sort of people there are, Let us start. And that is how the first Brahmarandhra chhedan took place in India. It was Fifth of May, 1970, 5th May, in the morning time. Of course it had also some events which made me hurry up to do it. I was quite ready. I knew what is the problem with human beings is. But I thought that may be they will never except it, they can.... incarnation is very unique type. So many incarnations came; they came, told you everything likewise, said this is good, this is good, this is good. Some people who were enamoured by them, followed, but nothing was inside their heart. Whatever they heard or read, it was like a lecture, it is Gita, that's all. And the life of such a person didn't have that spark of the Divine love within themselves. We have had lots of good . Now this So it was the turmoil, it was the turmoil, and at this turmoil state only, Adishakti had to come to establish the Dharma. She had to work it out to establish the Dharma. It was a very shifty place; very shifty sands were there but when I was born, I was shocked the way people went. At that time I don't think I met many seekers. Of course I met one or two realized souls, but mostly they were worried about their insurance, their money, their this, that. They should talk to them and did not know where have you come into some (dizney land) or what! You did not know what to talk to them! How could you start telling them about Divine Love when they were not seekers even? Then gradually, I felt confident. First I thought, T have come a little early, I should have waited still slightly more, that would have been better because here the people hated everyone and every individual is against another individual, and they are cheating each other and they are also very jealous of each other, and also want to have higher positions, and this and that over others; they want to pull every body's legs. So may be that there was not yet time for Sahaja Yoga to start. But then I saw all these horrible false gurus also throwing their own charms on people and people during this short time existing; you can see, Mahatmagandhi was there, Martin Luther was there.. All kind of people, you see, all over, Abraham Lincoln was there, George Washington was there, William Blake was there, we had Shakespeare.. All this time, you see in the literature, in everyway- Laotse, then we had Socrates, it starts from Socrates to today, we have had lots of philosophers, lots of people who talked about higher life. Despite that, people were thinking that these are some absurd people; there is nothing in it too much better. Nobody will say anything about, say Guru Gita, they wouldn't. They used to think-what's this nonsense? What is the use of all humbug going on like that? with this attitude, you see (decrying) all around when I looked for, (I thought), "How am I to tell them about what they are and what they have to find?" And it was really my desire that there should be some keenness in people, just little bit. If they give me a little

 11 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze fontannel bone area. It's the actualization of Sahaja Yoga has worked wonders; otherwise it would have been impossible. Al these wonders that you see today are because of your reaction, because the way you reacted, the way you received it. Otherwise Adishakti is what? Good-for- chance, this Divine Love is so subtle, it will just penetrate into their hearts. But they would not. They were just like stones. You couldn't talk to them, you couldn't tell them anything; and they thought no end of themselves, that's the worst part of it. Under these circumstances, Sahaja nothing! If you do not except, I'm nothing. And it started. Actually it is the way, I see your wisdom, your sense, your seeking has brought you to Sahaja Yoga. I never write letters to anybody. I never call anybody, that you know all gurus do that, as soon as they go to any city they write down the names of important people and then they send them letters, and get about two three of them at least for their programmes. But we are not Yoga started and there i found that the powers of Adishakti are much greater than the problems. I saw it very clearly. Because these powers were awakening the Kundalini. I knew that I can awaken the Kundalini, no doubt, I knew that, and also knew that I can give amass realisation; but I could never think that people whomI awaken, will come back again, because, you see, they are ignorant people, I never thought that they will come back, they'll doing all that, you see. How we have practice Sahaja Yoga, or they will go to this thing. I never, never, never, never thought this. If somebody had told me, I would have laughed at them! Exactly. What happened was that when I gave first lecture anywhere, that hall would be finished, everything would be finished. There was nothing to do with this hall; I was staying somewhere, and the hall was taken on hire. And follow on, of course, very few. So I thought that this is not going to get ahead. .since they don't want to understand anything. They did not understand. Under the big pressure and the family problems, this, that; that was not so important. The most important thing was that how to penetrate into humanbeings? So the only solution was to raise their own Kundalinis. To clear that little liking because if I go on sitting down with the idea that they will come round and ask me for Kundalini awakening and then I will awaken them, was the wrong idea. I could realize. So amass realization started. And this, really surprised Me. It was no magic, it was not storytelling, but it was the truth. They could feel it on their finger tips, they could feel it out of their managed this amass realization, Kundalini awakening, by which people started understanding Sahaja Yoga! They started penetrating into that. Now for that, I have to raise my own Kundalini like that; every time in a public programme, I raise mine also. And in my Kundalini itselfI catch all your problems. It's painful, that's why after puja, I ....?) become, sort of, like a (swollen.. .?) for a while. Reason is, I am absorbing all that is within you. Like I put you all in my body; you are part and parcels of my body. Every cell that I have is for you, for your (ascent); and you have to be that subtle to understand that if you feel for something or if you have something to be done about Sahaja Yoga, anything you feel, want to start an Ashram, or anything, immediately I know. How do I know? because you are inside Me. Most of the things I know very clearly but some of these things I don't know that clearly. Because of one thing. The relationship between you and me is of course very intimate, that you should be in my body but if you people

 Issue: 7 & 8 12 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze mean for three hours-four hours, you should do meditation. But it is how much intensely you are with me, is important. Now it is not how much time you have given. Then, I am responsible for you, for your children, for everyone. I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection, to save you from all your negativity. So it's not like a father who will directly punish you. It is not that but it's just alright, you are not my relation, I am out. That's the only thing that can happen, If you are not meditating, alright, I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you. You may have other relations with outside-outward. But this inner relationship, by which you get inner relationship by which you get your benevolence, you cannot have without meditation. I have been telling all of you, please meditate, please meditate everyday. But I think people are also not understanding the importance of what I am saying. They tell me, 'Mother we do not meditate."Why?" Now we are realised souls, why should we meditate?' Now this instrument is fully made, but if it is not all the time connected with the mains, what is the use of having it? In that meditation you will feel the love, the Divine love, the beauty of that Divine love. The are not meditating, it is very mundane thing, I must tell you. Dhyanagamaya. If you are not meditating then I have no relationship with you. You are not my relations. You have no right on me, you have no question to be asked, why this is happening, why that is happening? So if you do not meditate, I always say meditate, meditate, I have nothing to do with you. You are no more there for me. It you have no connection with me, then you are like all other people. You may be Sahaja Yogis, you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degrees from you leaders, bel don't know, and may be that you may are regarded as something very great, but if you do not do your meditation everyday in the morning or evening, you will be, really, not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji. Because the connection is only through Dhyana, through meditation. I know people who do not do meditation; then they suffer, their children suffer, when something happens then they start coming and telling Me; but I see clearly that the person is not meditating. I have no relationship with him, he has no right to ask me anything. In the beginning, of complete panorma changes. A meditative course, meditation takes sometime but once you know what is meditation is, how you enjoy my company, how you are one with me, how we can have rapport with each other! There is no need to have anything else in between-like writing letters or may be some sort of a special connection. Nothing. The only thing needed is meditation. In meditation you grow, in that spiritually you become higher and when that happens, is that in a way, I would say that when you reach a state of that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga, then you do not want to give up your meditation because that time you are absolutely one with me. That doesn't be just satisfied with one dance drama or person has a very different attitude, a very different temperament, a very different life, and lives always in complete satisfaction within. So today as being the first day, as you say, of the Advent, we can say that it is the first day when the Advent took place, as we are worshipping today, of course, it is was not today, but still we can say that if that is true, if it has happened, and it has been helpful to you, it has been a great blessing to you, then must you know how to preserve it, must know how to enhance it, must know how to enjoy it. You should not

They medietate individually, very much, it is very correct. Individually they will meditate. They will sit down, meditate, do the puja. But collectively they will not meditate. So this is another point one has to remember that you have to be collectivily meditative. Because I am a collective being of all beings. When you meditate collectivily, you are really very close to me. So even if you have a programme or something, you must do some meditation. Always have meditation as the priority for every programme. You sing the songs, everything is done, then you meditate. If I am insisting on something, you must know, that this must be the truth I am telling you, absolutely the basis of it. Though it looks rather mundane, but it is very important. one this thing or one that thing. But you should have a full oneness with the Divine, full oneness. That is possible only if you really meditate, which is quite an easy thing to do, to meditate is. Some people say, Mother we cannot get over time, we are all the time thinking something or that time we want to see the watch. In the beginning you may have little problem, I am not saying you may not have, you may have. But that's only in the beginning, but gradually you will be alright, gradually you will master it, gradually you will know it so well that you would not like to have anything else of a cheaper type, You won't hear it, So to get to your beauty, to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality, which is now exposed, only thing you have to do really, religiously is to meditate. It is not that at night I come very late, so I did not meditate or tomorrow I have to go for work so I cannot meditate. Nobody wants to know the excuses, it is between you and yourself. It is your gain, nobody else's. It is for your gain everything has happened. Now for us to worship Adishakti, I don't know, because there has been no prayers or anything about Adishakti. Up to Bhagwati they have gone. Beyond Bhagwati they have not gone. So I don't know what sort of puja you will have! But let's try something. May be, I think, the meditation is the best way we can really achieve something. So we can go into meditation for about five minutes. Now one has to know that we have achieved a certain height of relations and from inside you might go up to here, up to here, up to here, not saying it is not possible to do that. But first and foremost thing that whatever you may be, may consider you to be a very high class Sahaja Yogi, you have to be humble about meditation. This meditative quality, even when I am talking to you on the Sahasrara, I am getting into it because it is so joy giving. You just jump into the ocean of Joy. First it will be difficult, but after sometime you will know that this connection, that you have with Shri Mataji is the only connection that you were looking "Please close your eyes. (Shri Mataji raises the Kundalini of all present, She blows Pranava for eleven times) Eleven rudras are awakened and they will destroy all that is negative. Now ignorance is the greatest force. I am sure they will destroy this ignorance of people." May God bless you.

 HAMSA CHAKRA GRFENASCHAU, GERMANY, 10.7.88 Pravachan of H.H. Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi expressions outside. (Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany. We have never yet paid much attention to this center of Hamsa We are the people in the West, who always try to express ourselves outside. It's very important how you look, it's very important which is, I think, very important for the Western world rather than for the Indian or where you look, what you look, what you see. the Eastern. The reason is, at the Hamsa Chakra part of the Ida and Pingla come out and manifest. It means the expression of Ida, Pingla is given through the Hamsa Chakra. So this Hamsa Chakra is the one) After the Agya what is holding on certain threads or certain parts of the Ida and Pingla, and they start flowing through your nose, expressing through yours eyes, from your mouth and from your forehead. So you know that Vishuddhi Chakra has got sixteen petals which look after the eyes, nose, throat, tongue, teeth, but the expression part comes through the Hamsa Chakra, of all these. So, it's a very, very important thing in a Western mind to understand Hamsa Chakra. There's a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit:- It's very important that your appearance should be good. Very particular. They spend lots of time in improving their appearances. This is the minimum. Then they have a method by which, we call the media, the country speaks or manifests through the media. And the medias have to have a training. Every country has a speciality, and one better then the other. And when you see all of them, you find they lack discretion completely. Also, in our speech, in our expression of literature, expression of poetry, expression of our relationships with others, any kind of expression requires discretion, which is a deepseated knowledge or wisdom. If, in the West, people were not so much outside, they would have been much better off, I think. If, supposing, in England, people don't become punks, then others will laugh at them, and they'll think that this man has no money to become a punk. So a kind of a fashion that sets in, in a society of that kind, which has no discretion and which is very outward. Fashions won't work out in countries where they are deeply rooted into traditions, and into proper understanding of life. Of course, the countries which have been very ancient have been traditionally trying to improve themselves with error and trial, and error and trial methods, have developed much better discretion, much better understanding. But the countries which are not gone through all that ordeals have not worked out, have not gone through Hansa shvetah, Bakah shvetah, Ko bhedo Hams-Bakayo? Neer-ksheer veveketu, Hamsa Hansa, Bakah Bakah. Meaning the crane and the swan, both are white. And what makes the difference between the two? If you mix the water and the milk together, the Hamsa will just suck in the milk. So it can discriminate between the water and the milk, while, the Bakah, means the crane, cannot. It's a very significant thing for Sahaja Yogis to understand. Discretion is to be understood very deeply within ourselves, and how we develop discretion is very important in Sahaja Yoga. But before we go to that, let us see how this discretion plays a part very much in the manifestation of our

 - 2007 15 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze idea. In that also there has to be discretion. What conditioning is good and what is not good has to be taken. Now because there is no discretion about conditioning also, outright discarding all traditions all that is coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers, everything is discarded. The history is discarded, and we say, Oh, no, we are beyond it, we feel free. Like I was surprised, yesterday, in the plane somebody told me, I feel very free whenl have no clothes upon my body. I mean, if the clothes can imprison you, then what happens to the real prisons, what will they be for you? But that sort of a funny idea comes into the head of people and they think that we can justify all this stupidity that we follow because we lack discretion. all that discipline, lack in discretion. And that's why many of the people, though they are of very deep seeking, have gone astray. If they had discretion they would not have gone astray, they would not have gone to wrong places. But the discretion was missing. So it comes to the discretion how to use your Ida Nadi and Pingla Nadi, and discretion tounderstand what is good and what is bad.Now let us see the Ida Nadi. Ida Nadi is very important because the discretion in this can only come through traditional understanding. Ida Nadi starts from the Ganesha's point, Mooladhara. So first, we miss the biggest support, the biggest help, the biggest nourishment of holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara if we have no discretion. We always take to thing which are detrimental to our growth and also which may destroy us, not only us, but the whole country. We like people who are destructive when there is no discretion. Intelligence cannot give you discretion; it cannot give you discretion as far as the conditioning is concerned. For a Sahaja Yogi it is important to understand how you develop your discretion. Yesterday only I gave a very beautiful talk to the ladies of Paris, or I should say, the ladies of France, regarding the discretion of women. Discretion means that you must choose the things which are good for you. Which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective, which are good for your ascent. On the contrary, the people who have no discretion fall into the traps of wrong type of people. Like say, Freud. I mean, to an Indian, Freud, nobody can believe that you can go into such a nonsensical idea! But people accepted Freud more than they could accept Christ, because the discretion was completely missing. If they had that traditional discretion in them, they would have been saved. It is that traditinal discretion is the thing that comes through Ida Nadi. The discretion of the Ida Nadi is intuition. If you develop that discretion within you, through your meditative powers, you develop intuition. And intuition is nothing but is the help of the Ganas which are surrounding you. If you learn to take help from the Ganas you can become very intuitive, and without much intelligence of yours, you can say the right thing. The whole of Sahaja Yoga, I would say fifty percent at least out of that, is based on intuition. For that you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh in its right sense you have to understand. From there starts because He is Ganapati, He is the one who is the master, He's the chief of all the Ganas. So the Ganas give you the intuition. For Now that's what the people call it as conditioning, and they say that conditioning is very bad, and people should not take to conditioning, and one should be free from conditioning, which is absolutely a wrong

 16 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze "Hamsa,' is made of two types of discretions, where to see 'l am', and where to see 'You are'. On these two balances, as they are shown here beautifully, the Moon and the Sun, in the center is the Cross which gives you the balance, which gives you the Dharma. How all these things are connected one after another, layers after layers! You can see, how dharma is connected with discretion! example, say I have to go somewhere, and then what I say is that, No, I won't be able to go there tomorrow. And I won't go, somehow. Then people think, Mother, how do you know? I know because the Ganas are there and what they say is the truth, they know all about it. Or anything I say about someone comes true. So they start asking me, How is it Mother you have come to know about it? I live on intuition. Like I have to catch a plane, I know by intuition, what's going to happen. This part has to develop by worshipping Shri Ganesh. Now, there are people who are suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual. For example, I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, they come to the puja and they are giving bandhans to themselves like mad. On the way they'Il go, they'll give bandhans. Anywhere they go they'll give bandhan, like mad. That's just conditioning, that's not discretion, that's not Sahaja Yoga. It is to be seen, is it to be given bandhan or not? In the presence of Mother there in bandhan. Whatis there to give bandhan to yourself? But people, when I am talking, are giving bandhan, raising their Kundalini. They're all mad people, I think. In the same way, there are people, yesterday, I heard there's one kind of a music record is played everywhere in the ashrams, because they can all jump like on a camel; it's music for the camels, you see. Now, this record everybody appreciates. Why? Because they can jump like a camel. Önce you start jumping like a camel, human being can't give up, they form habits. So they like that particular music. They will go on jumping like a camel because now they have become camels, they have to behave like camels. And then there is something-some music- which is like a horse, like the trot-may be, may be done, anything. Now once they listen to it, suddenly they start following that rhythm. Now they become the horse which is running. Now the horse is galloping. They So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules a part of the Hamsa Chakra. So when we say 'Ham' and 'Sa', these two are actually the Bija Mantras of the Agya. But when the Agya touches the Hamsa it starts here. That's why at the base, at the root of it is the Hansa. And here the Ham (Ham means, "I am.") If you are discreet, you will not take to fashions, you'll not take to stupid ideas. You have you own personality, you are a Sahaja Yogi. You don't listen to people who are non- Sahaja Yogis. That is the 'Ham' part, I am. Not the ego part, but the 'Ham' to understand that, "I am a Yogi, and I know so many things which normally people don't know and sol have nothing to do with them. I've not to take any lessons from them. They're not to teach me anything. There's nothing that they know. I know much more." To be aware of yourself is 'Ham'. So that comes from the right side, I would say. The discretion of right side is "Ham,' and the discretion of the left side is 'Sa.' 'Sa' means 'You', means 'you are the one.' In your case, you know who is the 'you'. But for every human being, 'You' is the 'Divine.' "You are the one'. This comes from the left side, is 'Sa.' So the word,

 - 2007 17 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze the goud, can come to you if you develop that Liscretion part. become horses, and they only like that galloping music. So on and so forth; could be a donkey, could be anything. In Sahaja Yoga, at every stage you'll find people falter also with the right side indiscretion. And the right side indiscretion comes from the ego manifestation of people. This ego, as I said, is 'Ham.' This ego doesn't work when it has to work. For example, I find some people went for a marriage in the church. Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja Yogis, We don't belleve in any human religions, you know that. All right, you went to the church, it's all right. But they sent a lady to London to buy Laura Ashley dresses, to buy, and I think also, maybe some men must be wearing tailcoats to do the wedding. Where is that ego lost? That ego that you are a Sahaja Yogi was completely lost. I think they all went for hair dressing, all kinds of things they did, and they all wanted to go there as old Christians, walking to the church next to the graves of stupid bishops. It's not only here, India is much worse, as far as religion is concerned, the left side, We are not animals, we are human beings, and we are 'Ham,' 'We Are,' we are Sahaja Yogis. We are not dominated by any particular type of rhythm, or particular type of music. Every variety we can appreciate and understand, as long as it is dharmic, as long as it is balanced, as long as it is auspicious and holy. So you can see on the Hamsa, how many things are judged. I think the whole of Sahaja Yoga stands on the balance of Hamsa. There are people who are very astute, means very honest, but this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit. Or else, there are people who are very hard working. This can also go to the ridiculous limit. So these qualities which are supposed to be good, cannot be righteous. 'The righteousness is discretion glorified." If you have discretion, then you glorify that discretion into righteousness. Like you can say now, Christ, you can take Christ. Christ was such a discretion. When Mary they are very, very conditioned people, and Magdalene was stoned, He had nothing to do with prostitutes, I mean, nothing to do at all, no relationship, but He could see, in Jananadeva, he was such a great discretion, that these people had no business to stone her. He stoad up there, in His own courage, and He said that, Those who have not committed any sins can throw the stones at Me. This is the power of His discretion, that people just felt that discretion within themselves, and they felt that in Jananadeva had no shoes! What shoes are discretion, This man is a Holy man and we cannot throw stones at Him? If you are discreet as Sahaja Yogis, you will make others discreet also. Others will have to be discreet and to understand. And this 'Neer Khsheer Vivek' is the differentiation between the water and the milk, the bad and there they fail to understand what is discretion. For example, we had incarnation, and he didn't even have shoes on his feet. And these days they are taking out a big procession of palanquin, so-called shoes in it of Shri Jananadeva, and thousands and thousands of people singing praise. Just imaginel Who can tell them that you carrying in the palanquin? And whichever village they go or whatever city they go, they are fed with sumpuous food, everybody falls at their feet. The saints have come with a planquin.' And the shoes never belonged Jananadeva in it. So this madness goes on. Now you

 Issue: 7 & 8- 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze 18 see all these things happening around you. In every country, in every religion, in every stupid area, you'll see all this happening. But you just join hands. You become one with it and then it becomes so difficult to understand what has happened to you. Now this ego, when used properly, then, is discretion. Now also, people have another very horried, horried conditioning, apart from the religion, is of the countries. 'I belong to India, I belong to Germany, I belong to England.' 'Everything is wretched! I mean, to say something like that means you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara Land. Those who start becoming some nationality do not know that your nationality is transformed. Actually, you don't need any passports in the area where the Divine reigns, no passport is needed. It's written large on your faces. But still, inside, this deep conditioning is there, that 'I belong to this country. My country is very great. Your country's not good. 'But when it comes to discretion is to think that, 'All right I was born in Germany, and Germany has made lots of mistakes. Let me work it out. So that I get back all my German people into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness. There is, this conditioning is used in discretion. In everything you will find there are two sides. Which way you move is your discretion. Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing is Jew.' Same with Christians, same with other communities, same with any other nationality. Now what is the discretion when you seek? The best thing, discretion at that point is to see what are the faults of these so- called human religions which are formed after the death of the promoters, or, we can say, the incarnations or the prophets who started that religion? This is first discretion. The second discretion is to read those scriptures and find out what is so special that these incarnations have said. For I would say, if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see what's written in Koran as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned. If it's a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out whatever is written there as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned, because Sahaja Yoga is the truth, and what truth is written has to be found out. If such a thing is developed, then you can go further, if you are brave enough, and can be courageous to go and tell the people, that, 'See, what is this nonsense you are following? It's not written, it's not done. Whatever is written, this is the essence of the whole thing. That's the third stage, where you have used your discretion as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned. Now when I am, say, in the West, I have to discuss the West and when I am in For example, there are people who have a conditioning of a particular say, a religion. Supposing they belong to the Jew religion, and have come to Sahaja Yoga or they belong to Christianity and have come to Sahaja Yoga. So now, what is the discretion? As soon as another Jew person comes or a Christian person comes in, they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there, and they'll all become great friends. 'Because he's Jew, I'm Jew, my father is India, you must hear Me. You don't understand the language, it is good for Me. With all the respect for the Indians, I give them left and right, and tell them what's wrong with them. But here it is important that, what is wrong with us in the West. So the discretion is to see what's gone wrong with us. Where are we wrong? Have we got any courage or not?

 - 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 19 The Divine Cool Breeze For example, ladies don't have courage to wear a sari outside. Why? Sometimes doesn't matter. When Indians themselves. If you develop your discretion, then it works out. On the ego side what kind of a can wear your dresses, you can wear saris also. Or the men won't wear Indian dresses outside, is a little 'Ham' is needed. They enjoy it, but they won't wear it. They'll wear the same funny holy pants! They can wear the punky stuff, but they can't wear something that is sensible, is good to wear. It's something that must give you the idea that we are different people. Now this red mark is very important, because then you don't catch any bhoots and has to be worn. In the Bible it is written that there will be a mark on their heads, but because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama Hare Krishna, I don't think they'll wear any marks, we are freighted of the society. How to wear a mark? But supposing they say that, 'You will go about with a disheveled hair, 'you'll do it, because that's allowed in the society. discretion you develop, and how? On the right side are all the Devas, all the Deities sitting around you. You have to understand these Deities. You have to know what they are going to do. Supposing, now, you are lost on the way. So, you should not think like all other people, 'Oh, I am lost on the way. How will I go there? What will I do? 'After all you are going for some nonsensical work. Doesn't matter. But you must think, "Why, Hanuman, He must have brought me here for some purpose. let's be on the look-out.' Accept it, accept the situation. When you accept the situation, you are placed into the hands of the deities and they are guiding you, your deities are working it out. Accept it. .. And this acceptance will give you a wonderful discretion over your ego. Whatever goes.wrong, it's all right. We accept it. We are the people who are not to be afraid of any society. We have to come out of it and we have to teach them whatever is good, we are going to do whether you like it or not. That's the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint, anywhere, they have gone all out to say whatever is right, whatever is to be done, and whatever is to be followed. That's the sign of a saint. Otherwise you stand, sometimes, just dissolved in the society, sometimes in Sahaja Yoga, sometimes here. Then what's the use of such saints? And above all, the vibrations part, which you have to see. If you do something, if vibrations are going down, then of course, 'l am a Sahaja Yogi, to me vibrations and my ascent is the most important thing.' So to develop the discretion on the right-hand side, you have to know your goal, your destination. You must know on what path you're standing and where you are brought. Where are you today? We are not like other people. If that kind of a discretion you develop within yourself through pure intelligence -for that you need pure intelligence. And pure intelligence in a Hamsa is that it glides on the water. It shuts the water. It doesn't allow anything to overpower it. It's in the water Tell me any saint whom you know who has not fought the society, who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society, in a very loud manner, without any fear? Have you known any saint like that? beautifully, beautifying the lake, also not allowing the lake to dissolve them, or to overpower them or to cover them. This is For Sahaja Yogis, it is very important to have that courage within

 Issue: 7 & 8 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze 20 the part where they are Ham. If they want, they can dive down. If they don't want, they will not. They are gliding on the ocean, ocean of the Samsara, of this Bhava Sagara, and they're not going to be drowned into it. That is the 'Ham' part of it, which you should have the discretion. came near the cave, he saw the shawl covering this saint. He said, 'Oh, so now you are tired and sleeping here, running away from the field! Get up now!' As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him, and he was completely burnt. So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata, at His feet, or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on His head, in between the two resides Hamsa Chakra. This discretion is very beautifully deşcribed in the life of Shri Krishna. We can call him that he had a naughty way of using his discretion. He has done so many things like that, but they create a drama, they create His Leela. Because He was Leeladhara, that's why he could use his discretion to On the one side you should accept things, that they come to you. The best among these was Shri Krishna, I would say, who had real discretion. But after all, He was Shri Krishna. But His methods were so interesting, of discretion, that is enjoyable to know about how He destroyed so many rakshasas. Every time He did not use His Sudarshana Chakra, He used His desertion. Like there was a rakshasa who was trying create a drama, a play. So on one side we to overpower the Pandvas, who was trying have the help of Shri Krishna to give us the to overpower the people who were good. discretion, and on the other side we have Shri Krishna said, 'Now' what to do with the horrible fellow?' And this fellow had boons from Brahmadeva and Mahadeva and everyone, so Shri Krishna is the center, after side is Shri Krishna who is the one who all. So He wanted to organize a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa. So, what He did, that there was a great, right- sided saint meditating and He had taken a boon that, 'nobody should disturb me. At least, the one who disturbs me for the first forgive them, for they do not know what they time, I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person.'And this one was meditating in a cave. Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away from the bettlefield. His name is ranchoddas. It's a little bit derogatory, to say somebody, that the one who ran out of the battlefield. So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield, for there was no way out to kill this horrible fellow. And He went, and He was covering Himself with a shawl. He went into that cave, and covered that saint with His shawl. After Shri Krishna was running this horrible Rakshsa to kill Him. Shri Krishna Christ. In between is placed this Hamsa. So we have two great incarnation within us, who are the embodiments of discretion. So ane looks after the conditioning side of it. And the another side is Christ who starts looking after the ego side of it. The one who says, on the cross, 'Oh God, forgive them because they do not know. Oh Father, are doing.' Is the same one who takes a hunter in His hand and hits people, starts beating them because they are making money in the name of God. See the discrelion. Same Shri Krishna who with his Sudarshana Chakra can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasas, becomes the driver of Arjuna. The contrast of their behavior is the beautiful saga of their discretion. Now for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to understand that they have to work out their discretion in a manner that they develop their intuition. I would say the first thought could went and hid Himself. When this rakshasa

 - 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 21 The Divine Cool Breeze be no ordeals, there should be all joy and joy and ioy. But the discretion should be to find out what are your weaknesses. Whether have you done wrong? What's gone wrong? Where? In what part and how you have failed? Sometimes people think, 'Oh, we did a lot at that time. Now we can't do it. "Then be the intuition, could be the intuition. Could be that this is intuition. Try. Experiment. But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja Yoga, you have to do everything in moderation. Like, I told them to see, everything through vibrations; So they will put their hands, I don't know, to everything. 'Should I buy this sari or not? Even go beyond that, 'should I buy this face powder or not?" It's so ridiculous! It's so bad that ultimately you find that you have become a bhoot and you are telling everbody that, 'Your vibrations are bad, 'because your vibrations are bad. Your attention is bad. you have failed. Like I heard that people are saying, 'Now we have come here, so we'll not go to Guru Puja.' It's wrong. At any cost you have to come for puja. I know I have shown you place which is Andorra but not Himalaya. And, in Sahaja Yoga it is so comfortable that we want that there should be no change of flights. Directly we sit on a Hamsa and we reach Andorra place. You will. You will see that. But if you develop an habit of thinking, 'Oh, it would be difficult, 'then it will be." But as, Warren has said it, it is going to be the easiest, everything is going to work out.' Once you think like that it will work out. Everything will work out. But first there should be pure desire. Whenever such ideas come into your head, again, use your discretion. "We go to Guru Puja for our own help.' Every Guru Puja, if you remember, you have come up very much higher. Every Guru Puja has helped you. Of course, you say that Maharashtra tour is very good. I agree, it is. Maharashtra tour helps you a lot. But that's for thirty days, so intensive. Guru Puja is only one day. How many pujas do you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine. Sometimes even ten. That's why, naturally, it has to be much more effective. But Guru Putting your attention to nonsensical things, makes your vibrations absolutely disappear. So with discretion you must have common sense, practical sense. I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody about Sahaja Yoga. No, that's not practical. Sahaja Yoga is a precious diamond. You can not give it to every person. I've seen people at the airport raising Kundalini of everyone. No! It's not meant. They have to come to Sahaja Yoga. They have to ask for it. They have to beg for it. Then only they can get their realization. We don't want quantity, we want quality. All my lectures, if you see in that I am insisting on the quality of the Sahaja Yogis, and the quality of the seekers. But when we start thinking of getting a majority for a vote for Shri Mataji, I have to say, I am not standing for any election. Whether you elect me or not, l am elected. You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that and when you fail in discretion you find some problems develop. Puja, itself, is extremely effective. Indians have been asking me, "Mother once, at least once more, give us the Guru Puja.'We'll give anything to have a Guru Puja. Please come. Even this time, they wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine, you could not have attended Guru Puja in India. Now, it is for you to find out what indiscreet things you have done. Where have you gone wrong? In which way have you done a mistake? It is for you to find out. Then, rectify it. Otherwise in Sahaja Yoga, there should be no problems, there should

 Issue: 7 & 8 2007 22 The Divine Cool Breeze But Andorra, I have a special purpose. I have a special purpose. I have a special purpose. So please understand, I am not a purposeless personality. Gradually learn how I fulfill the purpose - yours, Mine, and that of Sahaja Yoga, together. How I work it out beautifully! You will understand. And I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful ways and methods of discretion by which you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing they will just give. They are not supposed to speak. It's artificial. So the second point we have to come to, we are not to be artificial. It's all right if somebody feels like just, out of just spontaneity wants to love me and hug me, I don't mind. Because it's not artificial, it just comes. Children are most spontaneous. They are not artificial. They're not at ll artificial. In the same way we have to be very natural about everything. It's all right, while. talking to each other if the men hit the men a little bit, it doesn't matter. They have not insulted, it's a love, expression of love, it's all right. But it should be spontaneous, it should not be artificial. We should not take Now, for the treatment of Hamsa Chakra, which is more on the physical side, it's outside, that's why it has to be much more on the physical side also. So either we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well, to put the Hamsa Chakra all right. Also for Hamsa Chakra, it's important not to kiss people. I think kissing must be given up, because in kissing you do allow the germs of another person. In Sahaja Yoga it's all right. But once I say that, that doesn't mean that you all go crazy with the kissing. No, not proper. If in India if you want to kiss somebody he'll just be standing on one side. to artificiality in Sahaja Yoga, at all, by any chance. But wearing clothes is not artificiality. To be decent is not artificiality. To be dignified is not artificiality. Artificiality is that what you don't feel inside, is to say outside. That is artificiality, and for a Sahaja Yogi, he feels he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness, he has that protocol, and he respects his body. Out of respect of the body he doesn't want to do something that will insult his body And that's how if you understand how far to go and how far to stop. The more you start expressing your love by all these gestures the less it is inside. The more you give expression of, for example, there's a method of expressing 'you, 'and you go on saying 'thank 'thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks.' It's just a lip-service. But many people in many countries don't say thank you' at all. They're very grateful, inside. The gratefulness, inside, creates the depth that is necessary. So, to do it superficially, anything, to much, has to be avoided in your discretion. But avoiding extremes, avoiding too much outward expression, again can create another indiscretion. Like the English, they don't speak. The just don't speak. You travel with them every day for twentyfive miles, sitting together, they will not say 'who you are.' There is no insecurity about it, but Then there is another way of indiscretion in Sahaja Yoga which I have seen, is that people start using Me in many purposes like that. Like, supposing now somebody's writing a poem, so he'll come to me, he'll say, 'Please correct my poem.'I will correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems, then he'll loose the capacity to produce poems. You should not use Me for your own purpose in that manner, but in any case you are using Me. But with the understanding that 'Mother is all the time with me, and is helping me, "there's no need to come forward and jump on

 Issue; 7 & 8 - 2007 23 The Divine Cool Breeze everybody sees it and knows it, that it is there. So for all of you, it is important to develop your discretion today and to ask Me to reside in your Hamsa Chakra so that you are all the time stationed in the power of discretion. With discretion we have evolved to human state, and to go further we have to develop our innate discretion, which I think is the essence of all the religion, of all the adventures we have had, of all the lives which we have known. Is the discretion around which everything My time, and to take My time, and to bother Me, so that I should feel, 'Oh God, when will I get rid of this? Or others have a thing, 'Mother you must come to my house, you must take my child, you must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard.' So taking attention to what you call, 'yours' is also indiscretion. Instead of that, you put your attention to Me, instead of taking My attention to you. It's a very delicate line, as if we are walking on a sword. It's a very, very delicate line of discretion, but once you know as a state within yourself, you are discreet, you cannot be indiscreet even if you want to be. And that is what is the ascent part, So once you come out of this chakra and pass through moves. May God bless you all. (Mother goes in meditation) May God bless you all. your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara, where you have to be discreet. Whatever then comes out from there, is blessed. Whatever expression comes out is blessed. From the Sahasrara is all discreet and beautiful. So much can be said about discretion,I mean it is endless. How far can we go? In all your decision making, in everything, you have to be discrete. It is Divine-Discretion. So much can be said about discretion that there is no end to it. As you know in these Some people have a habit of dominating Me, also. Like, I'm talking, they'll talk in between. If I'm saying something, they will talk. Then I play tricks. I'm good at playing tricks, but l'm very discreet. So it's all right. My discretion plays the tricks, because we have directly mobilized it. So better to be discreet and play tricks. In everything that we do discretion expresses itself. And if you are a solid Sahaja Yogi or a Sahaja Yogini, your discretion is evident in every way, and days of confusion it is the discretion that is going to take us to our right direction. So the discretion is important in every of our decision making and understanding the small things and big things and everywhere, discretion that is the Divine Understanding, we have to have. May God Bless You.

 MOTHER My Mother has the radiance of the Sun and the Moon, and Her eyes are the glory of the Universe. Her diadem is set with the Sun, the Moon & Stars and Her crown is ablaze with cosmic Love & Purity. Her ornaments are the devotions of Her children and She is the supreme Ishwari, the Parameshwari-of all that is, She is the source flood of humankind and the source flood of all existence. From Her feet humankind takes birth and all the universes their existence, She is the source of of all that is, and bliss transcending all experience. From Her Nabhi flows auspiciousness in a divine milky flood. From Her heart flows auspiciousness in hot fierce and protecting blood. Surrounding to protect Her own, raised to pinnacles unknown and heights beyond all others. She is the source of all devotions, of prayer and virtuous acts. She is the poetry of the soul, its light and comprehension, She is awareness of the earth, of cosmic second birth Of virtue, liberation and the end; eternal unbroken and without end. Her throat is like a pale blue star-in which is held the cosmic sound Light and protection from the fumes of hell; and cosmic poison's futile wrath. Within it divine souls take birth and angels praise in cosmic dance- their divine all-embracing Lord, But She alone is above it all, and in sweet play fullness holds it tight. Her forehead is smooth and clear, radiant like the snowy mountain's brow; Ablaze with cosmic light and love-pure compassion's eternal birth; Ablaze with the crest of supreme worth, arranged to set the worlds to right, Culminating in a snowy cap, the liberation of countless earths. Beycnd it, above, Her being ascends, Cosmic eternal all-embracing. Withcut form yet always there, The universe's unimaginable light. Beyond meaning, beyond thought- beyond the Gunas, and all matter. There She exists, the eternal Lord, Parabrahma without end. When this heart of mine beholds Her- automatically of itself gets up: And playing with the fingers of its own desire- on the strings of its cosmic love Singing of its pure existence and its devotion's unending flood, uncontrollable sings on, hymns of radiancejoyandlove, devotion inexpressible and radiant- At seeing its Mother's enternal worth; and seeing its Mother's eternal Love. -Rustom Nirmal Yoga

 EASTER PUJA 3 April, 1988 Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi is for you to resurrect other people. You can resurrect other people. This is the power. You have got it. Through Him, maybe, or through your Kundalini, but you have this power to resurrect other people. Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance for all the Sahaja Yogis. And we have to understand that He resurrected Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves. The message of His life is His resurrection and not His cross. He bore the cross for us and we don't have to bear anymore. I see lots of people having this drama going on. They are carrying the cross across to show as if we are going to do the job for Christ, as if He has left some work to be done by these people who play a drama! But all this drama is to deceive yourself and to deceive others. There's no sense in playing such useless things to show how Christ suffered. To make you weep and to make you cry Christ did not suffer. He suffered that you should enjoy, that you should be happy. that you should lead a life of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty who has created you. He would never like you to be unhappy. Which father would like his son to be unhappy? But first and foremost thing you have to be strong like Christ. How He obeyed His Mother and how He denied all the demands of His life! How He was committed and how He dedicated Himself to this a single task. He didn't bother as to develop His monetary side ar to become some sort of a big officer or to become another great rider or a swimmer, or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing like that. He didn't try all these tricks, and didn't try to hanker after all these things that sometimes make us quite mad. What He did was to establish His identity as the Brahma itself, as the Divine Vibrations itself, which He established. What you have to do is to establish yourself as the resurrected people, as the realized souls, as the Sahaja Yogis. And this is going to be very easy. Now everything is made easy for you -your realization, then your powers--everything has beautifully settled within you. It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and steadily. I don't think I have ever tried to force you to do something or have compelled you to do something. But through your own ascent you can see what's wrong with you or with the people abot whom we are talking. And then you can also know through all these powers whatever is to be known. All that is unknown can be your So we have to understand that His message of His life, why He came on this earth to do the greatest job is that of resurrection. If He had not resurrected Himself, I could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga. So we have to be eternally thankful to His life and to Him. That the way He did all these difficult tasks, taking upon Himself that we cannot do, we human beings cannot do it. It's only He being the divine, He being the Aum, He being the Logos. He being the Brahma could do it. own everything. But attention should be towards your ascent, towards the state. But now you all have ascended. 1 can see on your faces Christ writ large on your faces, beautifully shining in your eyes and twinkling. He's there within us, in our hearts, in our eyes and He has resurrected Himself and He has resurrected you too. But now it Now ascent is not some sort of a physical process. It is not that you ascend some staircases. It is a state, it's a state of your personality. And there where I always

 26 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze say... (Excuse Me, I think I' II., the sun is showing its results. See how the sun listens to Me. Can you help Me, a little bit, to take out things? Thanks.) It's very hot for Me, I don't know what about you people. Just telling Me off. I forgot to tell you about the sun so He's just troubling Me, so I better tell (laughter and clapping). They have been telling, for the last one year, you see, we've been thinking of coming here for this puja. And I was very anxious that we should have the Easter Puja here. But the dates were not very suitable, because those days the moon would be waning. So I thought how will I do it without the moon. We have to have the moon there. It's important. So I thought we have it sometime later. And suddenly it happened that I had to come here, luckily1 was here. at the sky, looked at everything and then gradually it became pink like your faces. It's beautiful, become pink, beautifully pink, and then now it's shining. I'm sorry I should have given full tribute to the Sun, the way He has acted. So that's why He is troubling Me a little bit, just to remind Me. So, as you know, the Sun is the Agya Chakra. Christ resides in the Sun. And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit. When He's the Spirit, He's the moon and when He acts on the Agya He's the Sun. Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely spotlessly immaculate. He had no defects in Him. He was a perfect personality. Then why did He want to resurrect, one can ask? What is in His time is the resurrection? His resurrection is like making the way through the Agya Chakra; for all of you to pass through it. He was like the gate, or we should say He was the One who opened the gate for all of you. Because He was so perfect. He had no problems as we have of our Chakras, our Kundalini. He fad no problems. But He was the complete compassion of, in the nature of vibrations. Vibrations became And then on the television for the last one week, they have been telling it's going to rain heavily, it's going to be very clouded and the temperature is going to be very bad and it's going to be very very heavy rains... (laughter and clapping). And again and again, every night, every time they announced about the weather, it was looking even worse, every time. So I thought, now what to do? If you ask the clouds to move out, you have to have a tremendous breeze and that may spoil your tent. So somehow or other, you see, I just told the clouds that you better move on to Newfoundland, slowly, steadily, not with great speed, and they did it. complete compassion. So much so that even when He was resurrected and even before that when He was crucified, He said that, "Oh, God, the Father, please forgive those people because they do not know what they are doing." Such forgiveness, such compassion, and the Mother had to watch all that, keeping quiet because that was the game, that was the thing one has to do. He had to play His game and He played it so well. And then the sun which was very bright came out. Early in the morning I saw Him, red like My sari, so beautiful it was! You were all asleep but I was awake, very early. And I was watching the way it came up, just like My bindi it came up. I saw it, I said look at the sun. How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful! Whatever it is, today is Mother's Puja, you have to have proper light, you have to have proper temperature. Looked So now when we talk about Christ, we have to remember one thing that He has done all this for us. Now what are we going to do for Him? He is the pattern we have to follow., Supposing if that is the pattern we have to follow, then it's not that we carry the cross on our shoulder, that's not the pattern

 27 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze anything else. Our lives are for meditation. You need not spend all your twenty-four hours, but you have to meditate everyday. You must meditate. If you meditate your children will meditate. And meditation is such a simple thing, for you made so easy that all the elements, you can see, work it out. All your Chakras are made of different elements and when you clear out with the different style--I mean, you know all the methods and the of you have to follow. Many people think because He carried the cross, we carry the cross. Anybody can carry the cross If you, in India, if you give about five rupees to a loader, He can carry a cross across. What is so great about it? What's so great in carrying a cross on your shoulder? It's not something so great. Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it, that's not the point. The point is we have to carry the work of Christ, of resurrection. That is what we have to realize. Sahaja techniques Yoga --with that when you clear out the Chakras, when you clear them out, you are absolutely free, absolutely at that stage where you have to be. But if you do not do this much even is to meditate, it's going to be very very difficult for Me and for you to achieve for which you have come on this earth. It's tremendous task that I have taken over. I know that. But I know how to do it and you also know how to do it but the trouble is you get entangled into your different conditionings. We have to understand the importance of our being, of our lives, like Christ understood that He has come for this great job here. And though He came as a human being, though He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary carpenter, though on this earth He had a body and He lived like other human beings, still He knew what He had to do. He knew what He had to achieve and He achieved it. I think His was the most difficult task, which He achieved and which He finished it so well that today we are having all the benefits of that. Now, by now you must have realized all these so-called religions in anybody's name, whether it's in the name of Islam, in the name of Christianity, in the name of Hinduism in the name of Sikhism, all this is falsehood, It has no truth in it. They have all tried to use it for their own purposes. There's only one truth and that is: all these great Now let us see if we have done something for Sahaja Yoga or not. We all should examine ourselves. What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? Not carrying the cross, I mean to say. Some people think when they travel in India and if they carry the luggage of people downward they are carrying the cross of Christ. That's not the way. It's something very, very serious one has to think about. And that seriousness is, how far we have achieved that state, for that what have we done? And a simple thing I've been asking all of you you have to meditate everyday. All of you have to meditate everyday. But somehow nobody has time to meditate. We are having these watches just to know that we have to meditate. Not for prophets and all these great incarnations came on this earth for your ascent and not for establishing those religions who are just interested in money. In these religions also you will find there are people who are either left-sided or right-sided. There are some religions which preach, 'you should be very very strict : you should not do this, you should not do that, you should not drink, you should not smoke." ere are some who say, 'you should not marry, you should not look at women, you

 2007 28 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze inside. The priest said, "All right, today I'm sorry you see, we cannot offer you meat because our fasting is there, but we'll have lunch." So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that. But the priest, was only busy drinking. Because it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed, according to them. So he's drinking and drinking and drinking. He drank so much that he forgot we were there. We were supposed to be VIPS, you see, he just lost himself into drinking! So we thought better now have an honorable retreat, you see, so we got up and walked out of that place and that fellow didn't even come to wish us and these officers, the Russian officers, didn't drink, they didn't do anything, and they were laughing and laughing. He said, "See now, this is Christianity that's why we didn't want to take to Christianity." So I said, "But see, that's not Christ." They said, That's true, but what is these people are saying, is it Christianity?" I said, "It is not." Now this gentleman, you see, was supposed to be the highest person in spirituality living in Russial should not look at men. All kinds of restrictions.' Even in Hinduism, you will be surprised, there are so many restrictions! If you see the amount of superstitions that exist and that are created by Brahmins in India you will be shocked. For everything there is a superstition, If you walk with the left hand ahead, that means this, if you walk with the right hand, then that means this. If you sit like this, that means that. Everything-they have made a human being into a machine and there's no spontaneity about it. All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam too.But when we find them in a free place like England, where there is complete left- sidedness, where you can do what you like, still you are a Christian! You drink, it's all right, you have ten wives, it's all right, you have fifteen keeps, it's all right! Anything you do is all right as long as you go to church and pay money! So there's nothing you see, especially for the Protestants--that's the religion I was born in-where everything is allowed. Now when we come to this kind of a thing what is the Christian religion is then comes to that, if you ask them the road, then they'll tell you which way to go, that's Christianity. It's coming to that end. So they told Me a story about the czars. You see czars wanted to have some religion because they thought everybody's having a religion, we have no religion, we must, have some religion. So they sent for some people and the people who came forward were Catholics to begin with. So the Catholics said, "All right, you can drink in Catholic religion." I don't know how they got this idea, but it's all right. In Catholic religion you can drink but you cannot have more than one wife. The czar said, "No, that's not possible, we have to have many czarinas, you see, for different purposes, so we can't have that religion. So they cancelled it. So then the Islam, you see that time, I think, there were no Hindus available, thank God. They had Islam. Isiam people went and the Islamic people said "No, all right you can have five Now, all these religions either are indulging into right side or into the left side. Some people like the left side and some people like the right side. I will tell you the story of a priest. I went to see him in Russia. I think I have told it to some people before. I went to Russia and the Russian people asked Me, "What would you like to see?" So I told them I would like to go and see some churches. They said, "All right, very good, we'll take you to a church." So they took Me to church and it was about that Greek Orthodox Church, you see, and the Black Order which is supposed to be the highest. I don't know how they call it. So we went

 - 2007 29 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze Now we are all identified with our so- wives, it's all right, but you cannot drink. They said, "That's impossible. How can we follow Islam? That's not possible." So, it's cancelled. So these orthodox people, orthodox, you see, the word orthodox remember that, they came. They said "You see we are just in the centre, you see. We don't mind if you drink, we don't mind if you have many wives, we don't mind. Only thing is you have to pay us well." Czar said, "Al right, that's good, let's have this religion." and that's how they had this religion there. called religions in which we were born. For example, if I told Indians now you don't go to temples, you're not to go to any temple, even if it is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you have told Me, don't go to a swayambhu temple at any cost. There are many churches also where there are very good statues, we can say, or have got something which are really swayambhus, but there are very few. So you tell Me and then go. But they won't listen to Me, they won't listen, and when they go there, they catch on their Agyas. So this is the situation of the religion today. All these religions have become sort of deformed statues, good-for-nothing. So now the inner religion within is the Sahaja Dharma which has to be fully followed. Now, I told, say in India, that now we are all become Sahaja. The story is like this, that there was a villager who became Christian. So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian. So he told them that you have to give me a big name because now I'm Sahib and I have become English man. So you better give me a big name. They said, "What name you want?" He said "Give me the name of Alexander the Great." So they called him Alexander, but his name was Blondie, you see, His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called him Alexander Bhoora. So Mr. Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went to the river Ganges for having his bath. So the priest said, the pastor, he said, "You can't do that." He said, "Why can't I do that?" He said, "No, you can't go to have bath in the river Ganges because the Christianity will drop out, you see." If he goes and has a bath in the river Ganges. He said, "This you can't do." So Alexander Bhoora said, "If I have become sahib, I have become Englishman, that doesn't mean I have given up my religion." You see, this is exactly what is happening to us when we try to follow any religion whatsoever. OnceI went to see one temple which was of course a swayambhu temple, no doubt. So some Sahaja Yogis decided to go there, but I didn't ask them, they didn't tell Me. When they came back, as soon as they saw Me, they all fainted. I said, "What happened? Where did you go?" "Oh, we went to this temple." I said, "Why? You never told Me. What do you have there? See, the Brahmin put the tika and it's finished." Then it took them one month to clear out. Now they don't go. They had enough of it. Same with the Christians. Now the other day I heard about the Paris episode where people wanted to have weddings in the church in Paris. So they must have special dresses. Somebody came here to buy some special dresses from... What shop is that? What name? Some big name. So the special dresses must be worn because they have to go to the church. And when they came out of the church with those dresses, they had become bhoots. I was surprised. What has happened to these twenty-five of them? What has happened is that in the church there are many dead bodies buried. They are all caught up. So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture, go with a detached mind. Don't think that you belong to that church. Don't belong to any church.

 30 Issue: 7 & 8 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze You don't belong to any temple. Don't belong to any one of these forms. Then only you will ascend. will do it. I don't know what happens. When it comes to falsehood, we try to follow it and when we know the truth--this is the truth--then we take advantage and we try to compromise. We think the truth will not do anything about it. Not that the truth wil punish you. It will not. Because you are realized souls it will not. It will not punish you up to a point. But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working at the same time. If you do anything wrong, like these people who went to the church, they were all And I have to tell you today that Christ did not belong to any religion. He didn't follow any religion. He followed His own spiritual religion. When He went to one church where there were people who were discussing they were the Jews. He went there and He was talking to them. The other day I saw a beautiful painting they had given in the newspaper, a very beautiful famous painting where Christ is talking to the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing His left Swadishthan very nicely and all the doctors, you see, one of them is listening to Him, one of them is looking at Him, staring at Him, another one is little bit paying attention to Him. He's just rubbing His left Swadishthan. caught up. Now they may say that, "Mother, why should we be caught up? We are Sahaja Yogis." Because you are vulnerable. You are vulnerable. Yet you have not reached that stage. If you reach that stage, then when you go there, all the church people will come out of the church and run away. They'll start shaking before you. They will not know what has happened. T have seen when I enter into any church all the candles start doing chat, chat, chat, chat, chat, and people start wondering what has happened. Even when they are having a candlelight dinner, I am surprised the way every candle starts flickering. And people start looking because the bhoots are sitting before them. You see. So the candles immediately show that there are the bhoots sitting here. With all this knowledge that you It's clear, can see it so clearly, and so now with these new achievements, you must rise above all these things and must understand that we have to be very independently looking at ourselves. We are no more belonging to any religion. We belong to the religion of God which is Sahaja. And Sahaja is the religion, it will spread only when you really become nothing but Sahaja. But that's something I don't understand, doesn't work out. I met somebody from, I forget that, there was so-called Amity or something who was supposed to be an incarnation or something. His disciples absolutely, I should say that they behave in such a manner that you can't believe it. How ardently they believe in this man. Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they believe in him. It is very surprising! You meet anyone who is following any guru, anyone -you'll be surprised the way they are fanatic about this fellow. They will not hear anything against. Leave alone that, but if he says you stand on your head for the whole night, they have the light you have within yourself by which you are enlightened, still if you are going to these left and right-sided things, it is very, very dangerous. We see that also today, I must tell you about the part that is politics. In politics also these people have developed two types of theories. One is left-sided, one is right- sided. The left-sided theories are democratic where you can indulge into anything you

 - 2007 31 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze you find, I mean all, everyday you see and you say, "Oh God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!" Decadency is because an individual whom you have given all these powers has no power to bear them. An individual cannot bear money. He cannot bear power of any kind. He cannot bear love. He cannot bear kindness. He cannot understand peace because he's still an individual. like. It's the individual that's important. The individual indulges into everything and you should not stop him from doing whatever he likes. He is an individual, so he has a right to out his nose, he has a right to out his eyes, to do what he likes. An individual is allowed to do what he likes to do, and then what happens? That we find this democracy becomes a demonocracy. Everybody is a Everybody is busy cutting demon. throats, cutting all the basis and the roots of life because everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality, because the individual is so great and the collective is lost, completely lost. But when an individual becomes the collective, this is the ascent through the central path. When he becomes the collective, in his strength he strengthens the collective and also the collective looks after, protects, and guides the individual. This is what Sahaja Yoga is. So the politics of Sahaja Yoga is that you have to become the collective personality and there where we feel that still we are something great, we are different, we are Indians or we are from England, or France, still if we are identified, then you are not collective. But on the other side, where it is more disciplined, more aggressiveness, more controls and everything the right side which we can call as communism, where people have control all the time. Now why? Because for the collective the individual must sacrifice. In that case, the individuals become weak and if the individuals are weak, then the collective cannot be strong. It cannot be strong. Individual has to be strong. For example, if you will see that, the people who come from communist countries, they drink more than people who can drink here, Or those who come, say from Islamic countries, where they don't touch anything, can drink more than even Sardarjis. So you can imagine what is the situation of human beings is that out of fear if you try to control him he goes to the right side. But he is in no way perfect. He is not transformed, he doesn't accept the situation. He doesn't become that, he doesn't have that power to control himseif. He doesn't get over his sitting aptitudes. He's still there. As soon as he gets a chance he falls into it. So that fails. So the individuals are weak in that case. In collective sense we are all one, part and parcel of one being. Then you are really acting as collective being and you are one with the Divine, where the sun is looking after you, the moon is looking after you, the winds are looking after you and the Mother Earth and all these elements they are working. Ether, everything is working for you and you are so well-protected and blessed by this special quality to enjoy the joy. Then you really become sensitive to that joy, when you are one with the whole. Like if supposing this finger or this finger is not one with the whole, is numbed out as it happens in leprosy. What happens is that this finger becomes numbed out. Even if a rat eats it off we don't know because there is no connection, no nerves acting, it's insensitive. In the same way if you are not collective and not bothered about collective, you're going to be droped out. You're And where there is complete abandonment, do what you like, live the way you like, indulgences, all kinds of things, so

 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 32 The Divine Cool Breeze work it out. As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that's what He achieved, I'm sure you can all achieve a lot in your life. not going to be there to enjoy the beauties of your own glory and that of the collective. So ane has to understand that we have to be strong ourselves. We have to ascend and we have to be collective. It's Today is My sixty-fifth birthday. Now imagine, I'm sixty-five years of age and at this age most of the ladies, you see, just... don't know what they do. So now you must come up and work out everything as far as possible thinking that we all have to stand up. Now the children are coming up. They are also going to stand up. You are all looking younger to Me. Everyday I see you, you look younger. Sometimes I don't even recognize you, the way you look younger and I think, is it the son or is it the father? The situation is that you are all blessed. You've got jobs, you've got everything. And everybody tells Me. "Mother, this is what has happened, that has happened, everything." Now, so what? These are temptations, be careful. This is not what you wanted. What you wanted is the state of that complete faith within very easy to find out faults with others, very easy to find faults with the leaders, very easy also to find faults also with Sahaja Yoga, sometimes with Me. Better find faults with yourself. The rest I'll look after. First you just find faults with yourself and try to understand others and love others and enjoy the company of others. This, once you decide that we have to enjoy, I tell you it's so spontaneous. Just this decision, this faith within you that I'm going to enjoy now my Spirit, I'm going to enjoy the collective within me, that's the Spirit. Just this decision itself will give you the power to enjoy, but decision should be firm, no hypocrisy, no playing games, no ego, no conditioning, nothing, just pure desire within us that we have to be the Spirit And the Spirit which is the collective being within us. yourself where you don't have to ask, nothing. Everything will work out. It works out. That's the point is. I hope today on this day of resurrection we have to be thankful to Christ very much for showing us the way. And also we have to be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves. Where are we? Where do we stand? What are we up to? What are we doing? What is our responsibility? What is expected of us? Why all these blessings are given to us? There's no sacrifice in Sahaja Yoga, no sacrifice. Nobody wants you anything to commit or to do or to membership or anything like that. I think it's My commitment, as I said that God has the commitment but you also have one commitment that your desire should be pure. That's the only thing, that 'let my desire be pure,' no impurities of any kind, should SoI hope next time when we meet P'l see even younger people than what I see today and I'll be able to recognize you. Christ died at a very very young age, very young age. He was very young, I must say. But how much He has done far humanity! Nobody could have achieved that much in that small age as He has done. It's remarkable. It's really remarkable. That's what I expect you to follow, His footsteps in doing remarkable things. And let Me see all of you, every one of you have to do something great. And today is the day of certain promises. May God biess you for that. And I thank you very much for this birthday of Mine (DCB-June-1988)

In the inside of us the emotions move. your being. Then only it will act and permeate into the atmosphere and into other people. I hope when you go back to your countries you will give My message to them, that we all have to be aware of our Selves. Whenever I went, people used to say "Am I a Spanish lady?" So I used to wonder what is so similar between Me and the Spanish. I think the love in My heart is expressed on My face, perhaps. I hope the women of Spain will become loving and affectionate towards others. If you put dirt on the diamond it will not shine, but dirt has nothing to do with the shining of the diamond. If you remove the dirt, it will shine brilliantly. For that you know what is to be done is to cleanse yourself. If you are still right-sided or left-sided, see for yourself and find out what's wrong. Just clear it out, just do not accept it, do One thing we have to realize is that Sahaja Yoga is love and Divine Love. And it's not attachment. It is not possession. But it is a Divine love, It is not love of the flesh. It is not love of any material thing, nor is it the love of your fame. But is the love of the Divine. not accept it because this dirt and filth is covering your diamond. This is what we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga. Then once you shine with that brilliance, nobody has to say with a vow that it is a diamond. You are; nobody can doubt that brilliance. Nobody likes a person who is a fake, who is impure, who is unrighteous to talk about God. Everyone wants reality. Only thing is that they should see the reality in you, or you should manifest your reality outside. The first one is not in our hand -- to This transformation really takes place if you really try to witness everything in its reality and see for yourself that how and why are you attached to something. Once it is discqvered that we are detached in our witnessing state, then automatically the pure love starts flowing. As soon as you get your light, the sunlight, all the fog disappears. In the same way, as soon as you get Spirit shining in your attention, all your doubts and your mistakes disappear. This is what I told you today, that you have to be aware of your Self because now you have felt your Self, your Spirit. make them understand reality., The second one--to manifest reality- is in our hand. Now for example you have seen whenever I travel and arrange a program, there are thousands of people everywhere. In Italy they just saw My photograph and they came to My program. I do not proclaim anything, I do not promise anything but they all came. The reason is they are sensitive and they can see that there is genuineness So when you are the Spirit, you are like a brilliant diamond which is giving light by itself. So it is important to understand what you are, what others are not. And this awareness should be a part, innate part of (Contd. on Page- 4)

 KRISHNA PUJA 16-8-1998, Cabella Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi do we react to this kind of horrible hatred for another community or another colour which is only skin-deep. Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja. It is a very important thing about the power of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state, This is very important also because, in these days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of value system, all kinds of turmoil make a very complex condition to exist. Now with rationality you might be able to explain: "O God, these people, they are absolutely useless", or "They have come to our country and are just troubling us." All these conditionings are there. But if you see, when they talk of immigrants, the Americans must know theēy are immigrants all of them. America never was their country. And they threw away all the other Red Indians, took away their land and very nicely they are the owners of America. But the reaction is: "Those who are not white-complexioned, they are all to be condemned, tortured." The state of witnessing is only possible through meditation. You reach the state of thoughtless awareness. It is combined together. Now the witness state is such a state where you just do not react. If you react, then the problem starts. It's a very simple thing to understand that we react through our ego or through our conditioning. Otherwise there is no way to react. Now if they are by nature violent, then also this conditioning of violence comes in. Then they start killing each other. They have killed ruthlessly so many people, thinking that they have a right to go into any country and kill everyone and take the land that is not their own. Actually, land doesn't belong to anybody as such. But no body has the right to go, defy it and throw away the people who do not belong to that country. Anything, now for example, there is a beautiful carpet here. As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego l'll start thinking: "Now from where did they get it? How much they paid for it?" This is the first reaction. Then you can even go further with it, anger can come in: "Why did they bring such a nice carpet? What was the need to put it here?" It goes on like that, one after another. Now in My conditioning, if I see these things, I would say that: "This colour is not suited for Krishna Puja, they should have had another colour for this Krishna Puja." So this kind goes on from one to another to another... But that means this conditioning is built up within us. Yesterday was the Independence Day of India. And I have seen the flag going up, our national flag, and the British flag going down. All that has happened after so much of struggle, so much of sufferings of the people, because they came to India, landed nicely there, and became the masters. So this is also a kind of a conditioning that comes in a collective way that you go into anybody's country, throw away the people from there as such and to occupy that place, and become the masters. It's like going to somebody's house, that belongs to somebody, and throw away the people who All our problems of our conditioning are really horrible. For example, racialism.. We have racialism. In America it is very much more, you can feel it, though they don't say. But if you go from Italy, you feel it; if you go from India also you can feel it. is this racialism? What is the reason? Why Now why

This Spirit doesn't understand colour, because it is so superficial and it is so very cruel to condemn someone for the colour. are inside and nicely settle there as the owners and the masters! Because they have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning, more in them. With that cunning, if the white people think they can rule the black people, is not where you can develop a witness state. (can you take the baby out?.) The same now is happening as a reaction. Every action has a reaction. So what happens is that you find the Blacks are reacting. They are reacting and their reaction can be very dangerous. Everyday I read their reactions are coming up. So badly! Not in America but all over, they are now thinking they must rise and oppose this domination. So this kind of conditioning is like a plague and moves from one country to another country where some people think they are superior and make people look inferior. And there are people also are there who accept this kind of a situation, accept this kind of a position, where they are supposed to be equal. But in their own countries, where they have people of different colours, a little variation I think, they are all black people but little variation maybe, so they form groups. And they start cutting each other's throats. I've seen on the television, how ruthlessly they kill! I don't know what is the difference of colour is, but somehow they have formed groups and this group will go and kill that one and that group will come and kill this one. It's not like Kauravas and Pandavas It's not two types of people absolutely opposite, it's not that the negative and the positive is there, it's not. They are all negative, whether they are White or Black. And they start quarrelling and fighting with each other. I would say, take the example of America, because this has been celebrated by Americans and because Krishna is the ruler, Krishna is the ruler... of America. He Himself was a dark person, Himself was on the black side. And in the same country where He rules, the another great thing is that they don't realise that if all the blacks, all the Asians get out of that country now, I don't know what will happen to them! All their sports are managed by the Blacks. If you want to see any American sport, 99% are black people. Then if you want to see also the music, because these black people, though they have black colour-which is alright, as you are white, they have black colour-, but they have a voice which the white people don't have. They can sing so well that no white people can compete with them. It's the full justice done with the colour. Now if you take out all the Asians, all the doctors, all the nurses, all the architects, all the accountants, all of them will disappear. Now what will remain? Now this violence is growing so much. I think violence is the only weapon they use now to express themselves. You see, here something happens, so somewhere there, you find they explode bombs and kill so many innocent people. It is very very sinful to do that. Even the slightest violence is sinful and these kinds of violences, in the eyes of Shri Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very well. Now this comes through ego. You think because you belong to one clan, another clan you can kill. Or something like You have to understand that it is colour which has nothing to do, nothing to do with your intelligence, with your value

 The Divine Cool Breeze 36 Issue: 7 & 8 2007 that, a funny idea into human mind comes in and you decide that you have a right to kill another person. people who are now talking of humanity, talking of peace, talking of joy are still enjoying these violent acts, either they are doing or they want to watch. So then you go to these films and things that have been created of a horrible violence, and people enjoy it, enjoy such films and such films are again created. So one may say this comes from hatred, but hatred is an outcome of ego. When the ego starts acting, it collects all these things like possessiveness, anger, violence, all this starts coming out of the ego which actually blinds the person. You become blind to the fact that there is no need to have violence, no need to hate someone, no need to kill anyone because of this ego that is there. hatred, also Now if you really become a witness state, if you are in a witness state then what will happen? If you watch any such things that are happening, it will subside. If you are in a witness state and in that level, then no accident will take place in your sight. Even if there is an accident, then you can save the person, you can help the person very actively. That's in a very small scale, but even in a very large scale, you can do something wonderful. Now one may say: "Mother, how does this ego build up?" Of course, mostly it is due to reactions, also it is due to the conditionings. If the child is told from the childhood that: "You should hate these people, they are to be hated, they are wrong people, they are bad people", they just start when they grow up, they start showing that hatred. And it is now like a cactus growing very big and is killing others. There is no justification for this kind of a behaviour by human beings. If they are human beings, they have to have human qualities and that is what is possible only if you learn how to just witness and not to react. I remember, I was not very old at that time, but we were living in a house very close to the Secretariate where they had a strike. And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra or something. So the police was standing there and by the order of the Chief Minister, they were shooting at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed through that road, they were shooting, and they were enjoying the shooting game, all of them. I saw all this and I just couldn't bear it. I just went down and For example you see two cocks are fighting. You enjoy that! Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying. One cock dies, they are very happy, as if the one which died had killed his parents or did something like that! It's very surprising. Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights going on. Every year six bullfights, every year, and the hall contains ten times more than we are asked the police to stop it. They stopped, you'll be amazed, they stopped. Then I carried those people who were wounded up to My house, took out their bullets and all that, called the ambulance and saved them. But for that, one thing was there: I was in a state of witnessing, so you become fearless. here, and it is always full. And now the women have taken to fight the bulls. Now if the bull is not killed, they allow the bulls to go on the streets and kill people. This kind of a violent enjoyment is still lingering into the minds of the people. It is so sad to see There is no fear at all, once you learn how to have the state of witnessing. Because when you are not witnessing you get disturbed, you get upset, you get excited, you may join also these

And that witnessing state helps you to win over so many difficulties of other people. will never stop. It's not thatl Once you watch the thing yourself, only just watch. Your attention itself is enlightened now. With that enlightened attention, you can just watch and stop the nonsense that is there. But we are always conscious that we are something great and we have to do this and we have to do that. There is a Chinese story about a saint. So one king brought his cock to him and said: "You train my cock in such a way that he should win." He said: "Alright!" So he kept the cock of the king for one month and when the show started, different cocks came from different places and they all started fighting This cock just stood up and was watching, just watching. And the other cocks got such a fright. They couldn't understand how this fellow is not disturbed, he's just watching, he's standing, he's doing nothing. So they all disappear from the arena and he was declared as the successful one. Under these circumstances what happens is that you become another problem. Because what can you do? You can't do anytiing. But what you can do is to watch. By watching and by just seeing things as they are, you really develop a very different state of being. Firstly all such people who are just witnessing; what happen to them is very interesting, that their memory loss is much less, because whatever they see becomes like a picture to them, they can tell you even the colour, the folding, everything. Whatever they see is so much in their mind, like a photo So this is the best way to bring non- violence. In violent places you go and stand steadily there, facing all the things that are happening and that witness state acts and stops that kind of violence that is going on. and they can tell you exactly what they have But witness state is not a mental state, it is a state of a spiritual ascent where you become a witness. The best way to practise witness state is not to criticise anyone, not to criticise. I've seen people who are all the time criticising others. They cannot criticise themselves, so they start criticising others, so much so that they don't even see what's wrong with them. They don't even see what wrong they have done to others, because they think they have a right to criticise others and they enjoy this criticism very much. seen. And your memory is not lost. While if you react onto everything, your memory becomes horrible. But people are so much habituated with reacting. Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit of reacting and I was going with him in the car. "So he was reading every advertisement, every name of every shop, every person, everything. He was just telling: "Who is that? What is that?" This, that. I was wondering: "Look at the gentleman, he's talking so much, what will happen to him?" But ultimately I found that all such people who are all the time reacting become, actually they have senile decay or maybe Actually there's nothing to be criticised. You just watch and see for yourself, that's all is your right. You have no right to criticise anyone or anything. But some people think that if you do not criticise, then it will go on like this and it they become forgetful, very forgetful. But this is not the only loss we have. With this kind of people, when they are

 The Divine Cool Breeze 2007 38 Issue: 7 & 8 in such a bad manner that all the conflicts of the world, all the problems of the world perhaps are related with this. formed into a collective, they can be very dangerous people, because with that kind of a nature, they have to do something. They must do something because, after all, they are combined together for a purpose or for some reactions which all of them have build up. In small things, in big things you'll find people do like that. And some people who are very much developed in this kind of behaviour can collect lots of people and do any amount of harm to others. So as Sahaja yogis what should we do? We should not react. If you see something wrong, alright, you meditate on that, you meditate. If you find anything wrong happening, alright, meditate on that. If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment do not reacti Afterwards when that person is quieter, you tell him or tell her, because at that time when he is so volatile or she is so volatile, if you tell, nothing will happen. I would take the picture of Hitler. For nine years this fellow was watching what wrongs Jews are doing. He wouldn't watch what Germans are doing, what wrong they are doing to the society. At that time the society also was very bad because they be able to make them understand that it is were having all kinds of licentiousness. He was noting down: "These Jews are like this, have been doing. In a way, you see, the they do this, they take money, they are lending money", all kind of things he got into his head. As a result of that, he built up a reaction into him that: "We must, somehow or another see, that these people go away from Germany." But then he thought: "Even if they go away from Germany, they'll prosper again. So why not kill them?" It went to such an extent that you cannot see such films, you cannot see anything of that nature that Hitler did. But he did it. And people who followed him also did it. Without feeling any Why should you react to a woman, I can't hitch, as if it was a matter of great pleasure, or a joy, or maybe it's a duty. How could they understand, or to a man? And this is one of get duty bound to such a horrible thing like killing thousands and thousands of Jews? What Jews had done to them? They could have corrected it. But why did they indulge Perhaps they look at women because they Gradually, I don't say always you can win over such people, but gradually you may wrong. It's wrong to do things which they reaction to anything which is stupid also can be very self destroying. Like some people have built-in reactions, like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving. I mean, you can't understand a man of his stature, of his level should have such reactions. That must be from his childhood or I don't know how he build it up, now he is in trouble. Very shamefull This also is, I think,... perhaps comes from a very great indulgence into reactions. the biggest problems of today's culture, especially in all the developed countries, that all the time men are looking at women and women are looking at men. For what? into such violence? And they wanted to finish all the Jews of the world. want to see how many women are looking at them. Or they look at men may be perhaps to see how many men are looking at them. Why is this happening? Because they have some inferiority complex in them, or that they want to attract the attention of everyone. I It can be very very dangerous, because once you start loosing your witness state, you can fall into negative collectivity. And thus this negative collectivity acts, acts

 Issue: 7 & 8 39 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze boast of how many men are running after her. Or she would think she is great actress. I don't know what they think of themselves? And the way they talk about themselves is something surprising! If she's a mother, she has to be a good mother and she has to look like a mother. But they are so much engrossed or they are so much standing on the basis that they have to be extremely attractive, they have to be the queens or I don't know what the position they want to havel Same with the men. You see if you have something within you, if there is any quality within you, if there is anything that can qualify you as a great man, it will be showing. You don't have to advertise, you don't have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing. So that indifference if you have towards the public opinion, I think you can achieve a lot. Most of the frustrations will disappear. mean horrible things are done these days to attract the attention of others, to get the sympathy of others, I mean if you see the level of your awareness, where it goes, you'll be amazed, Like they say one lady killed her eight children just to get sympathy from others. But think of such horrible things people are doing! Now if you want others to have reactions, you do this, that they want others to see you or to react to, I don't know, to give you importance, you can say. But what is the use of such an empty importance? But people are seeking, and it is a very common disease of modern life. All the time how we should look, how we should appear, how we should walk, everything is so stupid, and a wastage of energy. God has created human beings very very different; none of them are copies. Even in the nature you find the leaves of trees, they are so unique, you cannot match them with another leaf. So that's how human beings are created, differently. They are made like that. One has to accept, whatever you are, it's alright. Why do you want to look like another person? This kind of reaction is extremely stupid, I think, that we are spoiling our energy and life for something absolutely worthless. In Sahaja Yoga also, I have seen people want to show off a lot. I know who does that. But they should know, once you do not react to outside, you start reacting to inside and introspection will start properly. When you see yourself, you'll be amazed how admiring you are, how happy you are! Now if you go beyond that a little more, then you don't think of all these things. You just become thoughtless and you just stand up as a person who is respected, whose company is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for. Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is great. You have come here to emancipate human beings from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the way people are behaving. I don't know whom to blame... So one should not worry as to But suddenly our attention has become very diversified, our reactions have become very very funny. One does not know why people react like that and then why do we worry about what people react? All these things are not only on an individual level, but also on a collective level. As a result, you see, new kinds of value system has been created. Now for a mother, for example, shell what people react, what they say about you, what they think about you. You should Just introspect and see for yourself. After some time, you don't need even introspection. It is a kind of a state I am talking about, where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that: "I will not fight, so in between Me and My army,

 Issue: 7 & • 2007 40 8 The Divine Cool Breeze looked at them like this, and he said: "Wait till I come back, I am going to do Mother's work." He went to another island, he did the program, everything happened, and when he came back, he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started raining and thundering. Even the nature understands. Nature understands that you are in that great state of witnessing. you have to select." So Kaurava said: "We'll take your army, you give us your army and we'll strengthen our army." But arjuna said" "I don't want army, I want you, you don't want to fight, it's alright." Because though He will be there in a witness state only, He won't be fighting, but His power will act. He doesn't have to fight, He doesn't have to do anything, but His own power, which is outwardly silent, but will act and that is how we will win the But if you are very ambitious... Even in Sahaja Yoga l've known people who are very ambitious, they want to become leaders and I don't know what else. Actually it's all a myth. All mythlcal things they want to get to and worry their heads about mythical things. Once you learn how to witness, you will know the myth, you will know the absurdity, you will know the maya. So to overcome the problems of personallty, the best thing war. So this power of witnessing, you all should develop. Try to develop it, that when you are reacting, stop reaction, about everything. You'll be amazed, you will find yourself a very very powerful person, in the sense you'll have no ambitions, you'll have no desires, you'll have no special fondness or anything. But just you'll be witnessing the drama. It's very interesting to witness also, because then you understand the humour behind everything, you understand the stupidity behind everything. You understand also how people have been so violent, and you just laugh at it. Don't get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at it! After some time, you'll be amazed, your witness state will Increase, and when in the collective all of you have that witness state, you can do wonders without doing anything, without saying anything, without acting. Only your presence itself can work it out. I don't say that it will have effect on everyone, no I can't say, but most of the people. Any person who is in that state, he is the one who brings peace, he brings joy. is to witness. Practise witnessing everything: before talking, practice witnessing; before giving any comments, Just start witnessing. It's a very very satisfying attitude. In Shri Krishna's life, the greatest power He had was a witnessing personality. Without doing anything, without taking a sword in His hands, without talking about fighting, He is the one who has helped Pandavas to win the war. Not only, but through His Gita, He has tried to tell us what we have to do to win the war over evil. The whole Gita is the witness state he has described about. If you read Gita now from this angle, you'll be amazed to find that everywhere He is like a witness, describing everything whatever He sees. And He will tell you how this witness state has helped Him to I'll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi, who was living in an island and for Sahaja Yoga work going to another island. And he found the whole sky was covered with very black clouds, thundering clouds, So he just understand also human beings. He is the man who was not, we should say, such a big businessman. Because first He told you how to become

 - 2007 41 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze Sthita Pragya: Sthita Pragya is the one who is in a witness state. If you see all these verses on Sthita Pragya, is nothing but a person who is in a witness state, how he lives, how he is happy, how he looks at things. It's interesting, very interesting. First He describes that, not like sharp people who will describe first the bad things. But He starts with the best, then He goes down to other things and tells you that whatever are the three aspects. many things through vibrations. Gyana doesn't mean reading books. By reading books you become more ignorant. So Gyana means that you must know yourself. If you do not know yourself, you do not know anything. So it comes to that, you must get your self-realisation, You must know yourself. It's the second thing He has said. Lastly He talks about Bhakti. Bhakti is devotion. That too is another trick of Shri Krishna, the way He described Bhakti. Now you find people on the street: "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" singing. In one word, He's concluded, He says: "You must do Ananya Bhakti." Ananya means when there is not the other. That means when you have submerged yourself into the Divine. When you are one with the Divine, then you should do Bhakti, otherwise I do not accept. He says that: "If you give Me some leaves or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept." But for Him, the real Bhakti is only possible when you become one with the Divine, otherwise it's just a show. The first He talks about KARMA and many people get stuck at that point, that: "Whatever karmas we are doing, we'll get the punyas out of It." But He didn't say that. If you know Him, then you will know He never meant that. What he says is that: "Whatever karmas you have to do, you can do it, but leave the results to the Divine Power." Results are from the Divine Power. Now maybe that some people think that they have got money because they have done good karmas and start doing all kinds of bad karmas with that money. He didn't say that! He said: "Leave the results to the Divine Power." Because Divine Power knows best what is good for you. And so, if you think you have done something good, you have served somewhere to the poor, you have done something really good for the women or anything, the result of that, you leave it at the feet of the Divine Power. It means that you don't build up an ego for whatever you have done. Very well, He has written The best, but to understand Him, one should have again the witness state, to see what He has written about karma. So the third Bhakti part also comes after self-realisation. Now in the Bhakti you see there is no --- what is the value is and how much you've paid for it, and how you bought it, it's not important. For that, another great example is of Shri Rama when He went in the jungles. There was an old lady, from the scheduled cast means she was one of the Bheelini, as they call it, these people live in the jungles. So she brought some berries and offered it to Shri Rama, And she said that: "I've tasted all of them, and they are not sour, all of them I have tasted." Now after tasting something in India, people call it, it is not to be eaten, is that you cannot taste something and give it to somebody else, not that according to Indian culture! But Shri Rama took it and said: "What beautiful fruits! I've never eaten Then He has written about "Gayana". Gyana means 'where you know.' But that doesn't mean you go on reading books, never. Gyana means to know what you are. That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi by which you know so

 Issue: 7 & 8- 2007 The Divine Cool Breeze 42 such fruits!" So Lakshmana got very angry, He said: "You stupid woman, you have eaten these fruits and that's what you are giving to Shri Rama. Why did you do that?" Sita was watching, so She asked: "Why don't you give Me some of these fruits?" She gave. And She said: "My God, what nice fruits do you have! I've never eaten such good fruits!" So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down and He said: "Can You not give Me some?" She said: "Why? You were so angry, why should I give You?" Ultimately she gave Him that fruit. So what did He see in those fruits was the love, the love of this old lady living in the forest, her love which was important. food. Because he was a realised soul, to Him, he was the best to have food with. So your value system should be based on such things like love. Where you can get love you should be attached to that person. Where you get a realised soul, you should be attached to him. And not to worldly people who think no end of themselves, and think that they are great. They may be, but, to you as Sahaja Yogis, it's the love of people which should be respected, should be understood and to be felt. But if you have no witness state, then you will see how much money this man has got, how many cars he has got, what clothes he's wearing. All these considerations will be there But in a witness state, you will understand that you will get vibrations from this So when you want to give something also, it is your love which is important, not how much you paid, what value you have spent, nothing. It's the love with which you do it, and that love should be evident, if such things can happen. Even with Shri Krishna, the same thing happened: He went to Hastinapur, as they called it in those days, where these Kauravas were ruling, And the king was "Duryodhana." And he asked Him: "You come and stay with us and have food." He said: "No, no, I won't be able to come." He goes to another person, Vidura, who was the son of a maidservant, because Vidura was a realised soul. So He went and ate in his house, where he had cooked very simple person, you will understand that person is spiritual. And that's how you will stick to such a person, you will not go for artificial things, but a genuine personalities that are there. May God bless you all Thank you. [Before Shri Mataji left the hall, She said:] "I would say that after this Puja, I expected all of you to keep quiet. But everybody was talking. I don't know why, what had happened to you. You must enjoy the silence within yourself. I hope you'll understand that. Thank you.

 Be Sweet, Loving and Peaceful BIRTHDAY PUJA Juhu, Bombay, 22 March 1984. I have just told them (Indian Sahaja All the time you are scolding them, insulting them, insulting others. Insulting methods and emotional blackmail and all this nonsense is not at all traditional in this country, and those who try to do this will be thrown ou. You should not do them, I can tell you, in Sahaja Yoga you can not do it. Yogis) that you should not try to copy the western style of ego-oriented society where people use harsh words, because then we think that we have modernised ourselves. They use harsh words, "What do I care"l all these sentences, we have never used, these are unknown to us. To anybody to say like this is unmannerly. How can you say like that : "I hate you!". But now I have seen people talking like that, "What is wrong with us". "Who are you to say that". Like that we do not talk. This is not the way we talk. You see, this is not the way to talk. Any person who comes from a good family could not talk like this because this reflects on the family. But the language is most copied here than in the western countries. I am surprised the way the people talk here in buses, in taxies and the way they use the language that's something I can't understand. And so I have asked them that the language be full of love and in our traditional style. You should not have all these ideas of insulting people, of bringing them into situations that they can be insulted. This is all modern style. So we should not do like that. In Sahaja Yoga, we should behave in such a way that we should be dignified, behoving out style, our tradition. Sahaja Yoga tradition is that we talk to people in most sophisticated manner, the sweetest manner, in the most affectionate manner and inviting manner, And that is how we should all speak. So, this is the first thing I ask that in your expression of love there should not be a thing that you shout. I do shout at people who have bhoots in them, but by that the bhoots run away. But if you The way we do not scold our children. If we have to scold our children, we use language which makes them honourable (a Bahu-manav): Damle Sahab has put on a kurta pyjama, so "You are looking like Shivaji Maharaj. Welcome, shout, you get the bhoots; bhoots do not run away, they get attuned, so better not do it. If you have my powers; you can do that. But you don't have. If you shout at a person Shivaji Maharaj". We should speak in such respectful language so that they would not get scared. (दामले साहब ने कुर्ता पाजामा डाला है, तो "शिवाजी महाराज से दिख रहे हैं। आइये शिवाजी महाराज। ऐसा आदरपूर्वक कहना चाहिये ताकि वो घबराएंगे नहीं) who has bhoots, you get the bhoots. So be careful. You don't try my tricks, you see, I am different type of a person and I do say things understandingly, which you do not. So when you follow me in things I am the way that I am on the side that I forgive, the way I am loving, I am affectionate and not the way where I am terrible. Because my terrible nature has got an undercurrent Correction if it is to be done, we used to do this way; other side is not proper because it never corrects. See, that the other way you cannot control your children.

 - 2007 Issue: 7 & 8 44 The Divine Cool Breeze two-three years you will have Ashrams, I am sure. And in the Ashram, I will like to see of my Love which you don't have, nor those powers. So don't try these tricks with anybody else, You have no right to shout or get angry, because if you shout, you get back all the bhoots in you. For they are the ones who provoke you. They provoke you to get caught up into it and you get absolutely ruined, the more you try to do so. Therefore, the best thing is to stand in the centre and to have affection and love, the power that I have given you. That power you have to develop-that power of love. First, develop that power of love, then you don't have to worry, you don't have to shout or do anything. Your power will become (Krita), (active), it will work out itself and create that beautiful Loving, caring, affectionate, patronising beautiful attitude for the people who come there. On the countrary if you do not have this, Ashrams will be reduced to zero. It has happened in many places. You don't blame me why our Ashrams do not run. It will be your responsibility to see that it is Mother's House and people are coming to the Mother's House. How Mother will treat these people, with love, affection. Whatever you do- you can starve, but give to others kindness and sweetness so that the impression on the people, that people will think that he is not an arrogant personality. I want top class persons to be in charge of a Ashram. If the person is mediocre, he should not be appointed. By next year you will have all the lands in your hands and Ashrams will start by next year. May God bless you. atmosphere that we do not want to have anybody ruined. But if you shout, people will run away. Specially in aegoistical society, you cannot shout at all, it cannot appeal to them. If you shout in ego oriented society this will distract them and they will run away. This is I give to you, so I have to tell you, that you might be highest of the highest, first thing that you have to give me today is: in your talk, in your behaviour in your heart, you will put me with Love. I am asking for two things now. It is a funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift. The gift you have to give is the first thing is that you should express peacefulness through your own character. But it does not mean that people who are peaceful are timid, or who are morbid people or who tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid they fight with themselves. "How is this that of anything. You are not going to bow down to anything, compromise with anything, but vourself then you will not progress. You you have that sort of a temperament you should develop and express -is very important. The second thing I have to ask is that you be peaceful. Try to have peace with yourself. Now don't fight with yourself. Now, the western people have one problem that this is happening to me? I am this! I am so bad! I am no good!" If you go on fighting with should say that, "I am so good, what's wrong with me? I have got my realization, what's wrong with me? There is nothing wrong with me". Have that confidence in yourself, and then it will work out. Not that you start shouting at others, but supposing And the second one is that this peace and all this should express your love- Love to others. Like, now, in everywhere in next

 - 2007 45 Issue: 7 & 8 The Divine Cool Breeze Once the Sahasrara is open, the heart will open automatically, so you will have peaceful life. you understand that there is nothing wrong with you. You have to be peaceful. You all have to be very peaceful. You have seen, my peaceful nature has solved so many problems just like that. You have to achieve that peace within you. That peace has not to be lost at any cost, should be expressed outside. In a way, My peace itself becomes terrible. You don't have that kind of possibility. Don't do it, never do it that way, try to make your forehead relaxed. Many people come to me with face like that (distorted, twisted face) and I see bhoots sitting in their forehead, then I shout at them, forehead relaxes. "I am not doing it, Mother is doing it". Relax. If you relax you will find that your heart also opens out-why can't you open your heart? Because you have no trust in yourself. It will open your Agnya, open your Sahasrara , and your heart will open. On my birthday today you have to make a promise so that you be properly established by the end of next year, but first two conditions should be there. If you are not ready for that, God will never give you an Ashram. He does not want to give Ashram to some funny people. It becomes such that some people have no place anywhere, come in the Ashram. So unless and until you have people of that calibre who remain loving and peaceful, the Ashrams will not be established. You should be able to have Ashrams in every place. May God bless you. (Nirmal Yoga-1985)

 So with discretion you must have common sense, practical sense. I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody about Sahaja Yoga. No, that's not practical. Sahaja Yoga is a precious diamond. You cannot give it to every person. I've seen people at the airport raising Kundalini of everyone. No! It's not meant. They have to come to Sahaja Yoga. They have to ask for it. They have to beg for it. Then only they can get their realization. We don't want quantity, we want quality. All my lectures, if you see in that I am insisting on the quality of the Sahaja Yogis, and the quality of the seekers. But when we start thinking of getting a majority for a vote for Shri Mataji, I have to say, I am not standing for any election. Whether you elect me or not, I am elected. You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that and when you fail in discretion you find some problems develop. Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ( Hamsa Chakra Puja, Germany, 10.7.88)

Pravachan of H.H. Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
everything will be worked out; it has worked
out with so many of you and it will wark out
with others also.
Shri Mataji : "Today is a very important day.
This is a new starting for you, for you all. Try
to understand that you have worked very
hard so far, and you wanted to do much
more than you would have been able to do.
That was your desire and it will work out
definitely it will work out, If your desire is strong,
things will work out, and you'll get a great
chance of helping people as you have had help
yourself, and you were happy about it.
It's not just a talk but there's
something happening; so try to remember
that you are all Sahaja Yogis, and you
deserve a very good help, very good help
from Me and from God Almighty.; There is
nothing to be upset. These are all different
tests which will work out the goodness in
you, and they'll get the results: you'll find
Sahaja Yogis special ones.
It's better that you decide to help
others. It's important they all should be
blessed. You can do it. There lies your
leadership, that you have to give it to others.
Most of you have got it for yourself, but you
have to give it to others. Let the others also
gain in their spirituality. I know so many of
you have got your Realisation and you are
so much in it, and you are all very happy, so
be happy and cheerful. That is the first sign
that you are realised, you have got the
Realisation. With this Realisation you can
give Realisation to others.
It's very nice to see so many of you
who have tried to get Realisation, but who
are really already realised. There are many
who want to have Realisation, but there are
already many who are already realised and
who can do a lot for others who want their
help.
Today is a good day when you have
to decide for your future. You have to decide
that you are going to help other Sahaja Yogis
to get more Sahaja Yogis, and you have to
spread Sahaja Yoga. You see so many
problems are there, and the more we have
as Sahaja Yogis, there's no problem left, it
will be all solved.
The speciality of today is that Christ
came back to life just to do something for
us, so it's very important day for all of us. I
would say that today you should understand
that you have got this power to give
Realisation to others. You have got it, but
now you have to use. Those who have Self
Realisation should not waste their energy,
but try to give it.
Sol wish you luck that please, try to
get your Realisation proper and confirmed.I
hope you don't have doubts about it. If you
have any doubts you can write to Me.
Now we have got some very nice,
This world is full of chaos, and
quarrels and fighting still going on, so your
duty and your job will be to talk to them and
tell them that, first important thing, Sahaja
Yogis must become peaceful, and they must
enjoy the fruits of Sahaja Yoga. I am sure
good people who have come to Sahaja Yoga,
so it is your own duty to see that they
become good Sahaja Yogis and enjoy the
blessings.
I am very happy to see so many of

you coming; and today is for Me a very good
day also. In the life of Christ a very great thing
happened, that He became, He became
what He was already, a Sahaja Yogi, and He
tried to make many Sahaja Yogis if possible,
but at that time the people were not so alert
as you are. You are special people who are
seeking and who have found out, and you
can give it to others. This is not for keeping
with yourself. If you have got it, just don't think
that you have got the last chance, but give
chance to others.
The official video ends here but just
after the talk ended and before the present
giving, Shri Mataji also said the following:
"Once you have got Self
Realisation you have to give it to others
and respect it, that is important to respect
it. I am sure it will work out; and you all look
so good to Me and I am sure that all of you
will do it. I have not been able to finish
anything I have started and I have to work
hard to pull others out so they can see their
value."
I am all with you, and if any of you

 Shri Adishakti Puja
Cabella 6-6-93
Pravachan of H.H.Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
"What is Adishakti"
pure love, So think of a father who has put
all his love into one personality, then what is
left in Him is Nothing. He is just watching.
What does He think? He is just watching the
play of His desire, of His love. He is watching
it, how it is working out. And when he is
watching that then he is very careful because
he knows that this personality that I have
created is nothing but love and compassion3B
and compassion itself is such a noble variety
that it cannot bear anybody challenging that
compassion, troubling that compassion or
also in any way demeaning it, lowering it, or
insulting it. He is so alert on that point and
he is very watchful. So a rift has taken place,
you should say, from him, from his own
desire of love.
Today you are all going to worship
Me first time. It has always been puja of an
aspect of Me or a part of Me. Now one has
to know very clearly, what is Adishakti? As
you say it is the Pure desire of God almighty,
of Sadashiva. But what is the pure desire of
GodAlmighty? If you see, your own desires
come out of what? Not of the Divine
Love, but out of carnal love, out of
material love or out of love for power.
Behind all these desires there is Love. If you
do not love something you will not desire it.
So these mundane type of loves that you
have for which you spend so much of a time
uselessly, actually they do not give you
satisfaction because that is not true love that
you have; just infatuation for the time being
and then you just get fed up with it and then
you jump to another thing, to another thing
and to another thing.
Now this desire of love was also
aiven a personality, means ego, and that this
ego has to act on its own. It became, sort
of, a very independent personality which was
free to do whatever it liked. And we cannot
So Adishakti is embodiment of God's
Divine Love; is God's Pure Love and in His
love what did He desire? He desired that he
should create human beings who would be
very obedient, would be sublime, would be
like Angels; and that was His idea is to create
Adam and Eve. So Angels have no freedom,
Angels are made like that. They are fixed,
they do not know why they do it! Animals
also do not know why they do certain things;
they just do it, because they are bound by
nature. They are bound by God Almighty.
They say Shiva is Pashupati, means He
controls all the animals. He is Pashupati. He
controls all the animals. So all the desires
from animals come in but they do not repent,
they do not have ego, they do not think that
this is wrong or that is good. They have no
Karma problem because They have no ego,
because they have no freedom.
think in our mundane life that a husband and
wife are absolutely free to do what they like,
because there is no cohesion, there is no
understanding there is not that oneness, that
rapport. But it is like a moon and moonlight,
sun and sunlight. It is such a cohesion that
whatever one does, another enjoys. In that
beautiful rift Adishakti decided to change His
plans. She is known
"Sankapvikalp Karoti"; anything you try
to decide too much, she will make it
different, like today's 11 O'clock Puja. So
when this Adam and Eve business started
She thought that they will be just like other
animals or Angels. What is the use? They
must know what they are doing, they must
know why they are doing. They must have
the freedom to understand what is the

At this point Adishakti, which was

about Dharma, about ascent. But in India
people talked about Kundalini since long and
that She is the Adishakti, reflected within us.
Now, you see it is already read it out to you
that I will be in everyone of them. Now
understand this the Adishakti is the Power
of Love-of Pure Love-of compassion. There
is nothing else She has, only the pure love
within her heart. But this pure love is so
powerful, is so powerful, that is the love She
has given to this Mother Earth. Because of
that this Mother Earth, the amount of sins
we may commit, we may do anything, She
is pouring out Her love through these
beautiful things to all of us. They have also
this beauty expressed in every way, of her
love through the galaxies you see, these
stars you see. Now if you want to see from
a scientific way, then science means which
has no love in it. There is no question of love.
Even people talk of Yoga, but they don't talk
of love and compassin.
that these animals are having, why would
they have? So in Her arbitrary power which
was conceded, of course, She is the one
who came as a serpent and told them that
you taste the Fruit of Knowledge. Now for
people who are not Sahaja Yogis you cannot
tell this. They will be shocked. But this
serpent that came for them to tempt and
then to tell them that you better taste this
fruit, this serpent told the woman, not the
man, because woman is supposed to
accept things easily. She may even accept
bhoots, she may even accept nonsense but
she is the one who accepts. While the man
does not accept easily. He argues, he
discusses, that is why She came and told
the woman. She came and told woman,
should say. This Holy Ghost actually is a
feminine and so more nearer to a woman.
This feminine Ghost came as a serpent and
told that better you taste the Fruit of
Knowledge. Now it was the job of the lady
Eve to convince her husband because
women know how to do that. Sometimes
When there is no love and
compassion there cannot be any Divine's
Power in that person. Everything is
completely submerged in this Divine Love.
Everything that is created on this earth,
'everything that is created in this universe
and universes and universes, is all because
of the Love of the Divine Mother. So this
Adishakti's love is something so subtle, is
so subtle, you cannot understand
sometimes. I know you all love Me very
much, tremendous love for Me, and whenl
get the vibrations from you, it is like the ripples
that reach the shores and again they return
back and lots of little little sparkling drops
are there on the shores also. In the same
way, in my heart, I feel your love echoing the
beauty of this sparkled Divine love. I cannot
explain to you the experience what it creates
but the first thing that it creates, is that tears
come into my eyes. Because it is the
compassion, which is 'Sandra Karuna' is
they may convince them wrongly, tell them
something which is very wrong, very sinister,

had a glimpse of them. If they had told,
people would have said, Woh! What is this?
They would have never listened to them.
So at that time, the way the attention
was, the way the reception was, they told

of benevolence in their heart. So the first
thing that is achieved through this Divine
Love is your benevolence. The benevolence
itself is also a kind of a very misguided word.
Benevolence means whatever is good
for your spirit. Now as you know the spirit
is the reflection of God Almightly; so when
the spirit in you starts reflecting itself in its
full beauty then you become the giver, you
are no more a person who has to take
anything, you just become the giver. You are
so fulfilled. Now this Advent came at a time
which was judged what time it should come.
As I said you have freedom, people were
going amuck doing all kinds of things. So if
you see that just before this we had a big
problem of people working out their power,
like people will go to India to occupy the
territory of India, or to China or besides they
went up to Africa and all these places. Even
Americans went to, so called Americans,
went to America and occupied it.
'Ardra', it is not dry. Like a father's
compassion could be very dry; alright, do
this, otherwise I will shoot you, I will do this.
Mother will say, but she won't say something
that will be that hurting. She will have to say
sometimes to correct you but her saying is
very different from the father's, because she
has got Sandra Karuna. Ardra, 'Ardra' is
which is not dry. This kind of a heart She
developed because of the Divine Love that
She was having. So every part of the body,
everything is created out of Divine Love.
Every bit of it emits nothing but Divine Love.
Vibrations are nothing but Divine Love.
Now as I have told you before also
that this incarnation had to come. The time
had come. It was all being seen that the time
has come. But there is a difference between
fixed time and the time which is Sahaja.
Fixed time is such that, you can say that,
this train will leave of this time, it will reach
this time. You can say that some machinery
is producing something, in such time it will
produce so many things. But living things
which are spontaneous, which are Sahaja,
you cannot see time. In the same way this
process of freedom. You have the maximum
freedom. So one could not say what time
this will happen, that people will be available
to receive this subtle knowledge of Divine
Love. Knowledge also could be very dry. We
had terrible people in India who were busy
with the reading and with the recitation of
mantras, this, that and they became so dry-
so dry that just bone structures left and so
hot tempered that they looked at anybody
and that person will become into ashes.I
mean, is this the way you have come on this
earth to do all the tapasayas and everything
just to make somebody into ashes? But
that's how they thought that they were very
great because they looked at somebody and
that person disappears or becomes ashes
(Bhasmisat, they call it) There was no idea
So this was the time when they were
using their freedom for power only. That was
not the time for the Adishakti to be born. They
were the people who were power oriented3B
not that today we do not have, we have, but
these were seeking only power and also
these territories. It is not important. So it
could not be at that time. At that time, one
had to fight for your freedom, for getting out
of the clutches of these imperialists and
people who were trying to overpower. Now
gradually it changed. It changed and
changed in such a smooth way! It is very
surprising! I saw the change coming up
myself. It worked out, as you know thatI
myself took part in the freedom
movement of India. It is important. In India
it started, first the freedom from
imperialism and then gradually this
freedom from imperialism started
spreading in every country. People
started thinking about the freedom; they

been wasted on these people, Divine love
would have been a waste, because mentally
people were not prepared to understand. You
could not teil them that this is absolutely out
of your blindness, ignorance, you are doing
this. This is not the right thing for you. This
will not make you noble. This is ignoble. You
have been ignoble this, Of course, so many
saints came, they talked of nobility, of
foregiveness, of unity, of oneness, everything
they said. Big seers were born. They also
reached that point, talked about it. But still
people were not prepared so much.
Gradually, I think their teachings and all that
started working into them.
started understanding that there is no use
having colonies and all that, better come
back to your own positions. So when this
happened, I mean this happened in my own
life time, I must say; first people who tried to
have freedom in our country died. So many
were killed; you know, we have people like
Bhagat Singh, in every country. All the
revolutionaries were thrown out and ill-
treated and killed. It is not a question of
Independence. But that one had to go
through, so that, freedom was tested. Now
they thought that this was nonsensical thing
we did. This was no freedom because after
all doing all that they started repenting and
developing a kind of fear and a fright from
others and a kind of a very disturbed left
Vishudhi started. They felt very guilty, that
they have done very wrong. That they should
not have done.
But the biggest problem is with these
so called religions that they started. All these
religions got derailed and they formed a kind
of puddings, Muslims here, Christians here,
Hindus there. This is this, this is that. So you
really needed this river of life to fill up all these
puddles and make them one. It is complete
ignorance. It is sheer stupidity to think that
one human being is higher than another. You
can only say one thing that at a different state
you are, some are at a different state, some
are at a higher state, but in general you
cannot condemn somebody that he is no
good, this society is not good. In general,
individually you can say. In general you
cannot say. But this ignorance was so dark
because it became collective, it is a
collective ignorance-collective ignorance.
They all joined hands together collectivily to
say that this is the religion that is the best,
we are only the ones who have saved ones.
Another said no, no, no, no, no, these are
absolutely condemned people, we are the
best; and under the name of religion, under
the name of God Almighty, they started this
nonsense. So now Adishakti had to assert
with the complete force. So the first thing
She realised that one should know what is a
family. A child grows in the family. If the
At this juncture also there were other
problems, like we had caste system and
other problems like slavery and all kinds of
things-disparities and some people were
treated as lower people and some as higher
people, some higher races, some lower
races. All these stupid things were there.
Through their freedom they created, through
their freedom. It is not so, it is not the fact, it
is not the truth but they created the things
like that. Now supposing I want to create
something here just to say that alright, this
is not a carpet, go on telling you this is not a
carpet, this is not a carpet. The brain is
washed, you see that this is not a carpet. It
is something else. It is like a mesmeric thing
I feel the way people accepted this nonsense
of racialism, of all kinds of disparities, of
slavery, of caste system and specially ill
treating women. All this came out of the
choice that was given to them to select what
is good, what is bad. So to them it was very
good, it was a nice thing to do. Under these
circumstances compassion would have

of economic reasons and things like that.
So now at this time, when we see this very
crucial time, it was, when the people had to
know love and the family had started
breaking in every country, specially western
countries, where men and women never
realised the importance of family life. They
never had faith in their family, So it became
such a shifty thing for the poor children. They
were on shifty grounds. They could not grow
properly, So it created a generation of violent,
horribly possessed children. This generation
then, went into warmongering. They don't
children do not get the proper attention from
the father or the mother, we can say, if they
are also spoiled or if not spoiled if they are
over indulged into or they are neglected, then
the child does not know what love is. If a
child does not know what love is, love does
not mean that you spoil the
child or you give him lots of toys to play and
get rid of him.
It means that all the time your
attention is on your child and that attention
is not indulgence but an attention for the
benevolence of the child. So all the time you know-they feel like fighting. I have seen
are seeing that there is benevolence and
thus I thought the family life has to be first of
all substantiated. Very important; because

they have started nunneries and then priests

misleading the people that people started
taking to this kind of sanyasa, getting out of
their houses, getting away from their wives
and children. So the first point I realised,
human beings cannot have love, who have
not known what is love is; and this love is
more effective if it is collective. See we must
have seen that in India people really love
each other in a family. I mean in so many
relations we do not know how we are realted
to them! We just call them brothers, sisters,
this, that. We do not know what is the
relationship, whose father or whose sister,
nothing, but we just feel this is our brother
and if you ask how he is your brother, you
do not know how he is your brother. The
reason is we had joint family system.

are you fighting? It is nice to fight, you know.
But why are you fighting? They do not know.
The reason, there is no love. So everything
that you see, you detest. I don't like it, I don't

So a new trend started, apart from the war
when it was over, naturally the value system
dropped down. People felt what is the use,
you see. We had all these values so what
did we get? Warl And what is the war for?
War has just killed all our society and killed
our children, everybody and what is great
about the war system? So the mind of the
people, on the whole, was that somehow or
other you must fight, that the fittest man is
the best. So the one who can dominate, the
one who can come up, is the best. So the
domination of these imperial style of Govt.
was over but individually it became a process
of domination. With this process of
domination, ego started developing. Even to
children they used to give education in such
a way that children became very arrogant,
very artificial, extremely arrogant and
artificial. It was impossible to understand why
these children were not at all controlled, were
told that this is wrong! Because the parents
also took a very very different. .attitude.
The Joint family system is just like a
collective system. So nobody knew who was
his real brother, who was his step brother,
who was his cousin, nothing. That all lived
together as just relations. But then this also

They wouldn't feel their children and tell them
what is wrong. They were so attached to
their idea that these children will leave us,
that they said "do whatever you like but
still ." Under these circumstances even
human beings as such were (devided)
between a good family life and divorces and
the funny society which believes in sharing
women and sharing men and all kinds of
things. So what a terrible situation was there
for Adishakti to assert Herself! Then, also
there was very big problem about the
religions asserting themselves, their own
ideas, their own conditionings on people and

as to what the atmosphere is, worrying as
to what sort of people there are, Let us start.
And that is how the first Brahmarandhra

incarnations came; they came, told you
everything likewise, said this is good, this is
good, this is good. Some people who were
enamoured by them, followed, but nothing
was inside their heart. Whatever they heard
or read, it was like a lecture, it is Gita, that's
all. And the life of such a person didn't have
that spark of the Divine love within
themselves. We have had lots of good

So it was the turmoil, it was the
turmoil, and at this turmoil state only,
Adishakti had to come to establish the
Dharma. She had to work it out to establish
the Dharma. It was a very shifty place; very
shifty sands were there but when I was born,
I was shocked the way people went. At that
time I don't think I met many seekers. Of
course I met one or two realized souls, but
mostly they were worried about their
insurance, their money, their this, that. They
should talk to them and did not know where
have you come into some (dizney land) or
what! You did not know what to talk to them!
How could you start telling them about Divine
Love when they were not seekers even?
Then gradually, I felt confident. First I thought,
T have come a little early, I should have waited
still slightly more, that would have been better
because here the people hated everyone
and every individual is against another
individual, and they are cheating each other
and they are also very jealous of each other,
and also want to have higher positions, and
this and that over others; they want to pull
every body's legs. So may be that there was
not yet time for Sahaja Yoga to start. But then
I saw all these horrible false gurus also
throwing their own charms on people and
people during this short time existing; you
can see, Mahatmagandhi was there, Martin
Luther was there.. All kind of people, you see,
all over, Abraham Lincoln was there, George
Washington was there, William Blake was
there, we had Shakespeare.. All this time, you
see in the literature, in everyway- Laotse,
then we had Socrates, it starts from
Socrates to today, we have had lots of
philosophers, lots of people who talked about
higher life. Despite that, people were thinking
that these are some absurd people; there is
nothing in it too much better. Nobody will say
anything about, say Guru Gita, they wouldn't.
They used to think-what's this nonsense?
What is the use of all humbug going on like
that? with this attitude, you see (decrying)
all around when I looked for, (I thought), "How
am I to tell them about what they are and
what they have to find?" And it was really my
desire that there should be some keenness
in people, just little bit. If they give me a little

these wonders that you see today are

you reacted, the way you received it.
Otherwise Adishakti is what? Good-for-

just penetrate into their hearts. But they

go to any city they write down the names of
important people and then they send them
letters, and get about two three of them at
least for their programmes. But we are not

powers of Adishakti are much greater than
the problems. I saw it very clearly. Because
these powers were awakening the

Kundalini, no doubt, I knew that, and also
knew that I can give amass realisation; but I
could never think that people whomI
awaken, will come back again, because,
you see, they are ignorant people, I never
thought that they will come back, they'll doing all that, you see. How we have

thing. I never, never, never, never thought this.
If somebody had told me, I would have
laughed at them! Exactly. What happened
was that when I gave first lecture anywhere,
that hall would be finished, everything would
be finished. There was nothing to do with
this hall; I was staying somewhere, and the
hall was taken on hire. And follow on, of
course, very few. So I thought that this is not
going to get ahead. .since they don't
want to understand anything. They did not

family problems, this, that; that was not so
important. The most important thing was that
how to penetrate into humanbeings? So the
only solution was to raise their own
Kundalinis. To clear that little liking because
if I go on sitting down with the idea that they
will come round and ask me for Kundalini
awakening and then I will awaken them, was
the wrong idea. I could realize. So amass

if you have something to be done about

mean for three hours-four hours, you should
do meditation. But it is how much intensely
you are with me, is important. Now it is not
how much time you have given. Then, I am
responsible for you, for your children, for
everyone. I am responsible for your ascent,
for your protection, to save you from all your
negativity. So it's not like a father who will
directly punish you. It is not that but it's just
alright, you are not my relation, I am out.
That's the only thing that can happen, If you
are not meditating, alright, I cannot force you,
I have nothing to do with you. You may have
other relations with outside-outward. But
this inner relationship, by which you get
inner relationship by which you get your
benevolence, you cannot have without
meditation. I have been telling all of you,
please meditate, please meditate everyday.
But I think people are also not understanding
the importance of what I am saying. They
tell me, 'Mother we do not meditate."Why?"
Now we are realised souls, why should we
meditate?' Now this instrument is fully made,
but if it is not all the time connected with the
mains, what is the use of having it? In that
meditation you will feel the love, the Divine
love, the beauty of that Divine love. The

thing, I must tell you. Dhyanagamaya. If
you are not meditating then I have no
relationship with you. You are not my
relations. You have no right on me, you
have no question to be asked, why this
is happening, why that is happening? So
if you do not meditate, I always say
meditate, meditate, I have nothing to do
with you. You are no more there for me.
It you have no connection with me, then
you are like all other people. You may be

Sahaja Yoga degrees from you leaders,

are regarded as something very great,
but if you do not do your meditation
everyday in the morning or evening, you
will be, really, not anymore in the realm
of Shri Mataji. Because the connection
is only through Dhyana, through
meditation. I know people who do not do
meditation; then they suffer, their
children suffer, when something
happens then they start coming and
telling Me; but I see clearly that the
person is not meditating. I have no
relationship with him, he has no right to
ask me anything. In the beginning, of complete panorma changes. A meditative
course, meditation takes sometime but once
you know what is meditation is, how you
enjoy my company, how you are one with
me, how we can have rapport with each
other! There is no need to have anything else
in between-like writing letters or may be
some sort of a special connection. Nothing.
The only thing needed is meditation. In
meditation you grow, in that spiritually you
become higher and when that happens, is
that in a way, I would say that when you
reach a state of that, I should say, maturity
in Sahaja Yoga, then you do not want to give
up your meditation because that time you
are absolutely one with me. That doesn't be just satisfied with one dance drama or
person has a very different attitude, a very
different temperament, a very different life,
and lives always in complete satisfaction
within.
So today as being the first day, as
you say, of the Advent, we can say that it is
the first day when the Advent took place, as
we are worshipping today, of course, it is
was not today, but still we can say that if
that is true, if it has happened, and it has
been helpful to you, it has been a great
blessing to you, then must you know how to
preserve it, must know how to enhance it,
must know how to enjoy it. You should not

out for. And also there is another point people
get lost with, which I have seen very
common with some people, who get lost.
They medietate individually, very much, it is
very correct. Individually they will meditate.
They will sit down, meditate, do the puja. But
collectively they will not meditate. So this is
another point one has to remember that you
have to be collectivily meditative. Because I
am a collective being of all beings. When
you meditate collectivily, you are really very
close to me. So even if you have a
programme or something, you must do
some meditation. Always have meditation
as the priority for every programme. You
sing the songs, everything is done, then
you meditate. If I am insisting on
something, you must know, that this must
be the truth I am telling you, absolutely
the basis of it. Though it looks rather
mundane, but it is very important.
one this thing or one that thing. But you
should have a full oneness with the
Divine, full oneness. That is possible only
if you really meditate, which is quite an easy
thing to do, to meditate is. Some people say,
Mother we cannot get over time, we are all
the time thinking something or that time we
want to see the watch. In the beginning you
may have little problem, I am not saying you
may not have, you may have. But that's only
in the beginning, but gradually you will be
alright, gradually you will master it, gradually
you will know it so well that you would not
like to have anything else of a cheaper type,
You won't hear it, So to get to your beauty, to
get to your glory, to get to your own great
personality, which is now exposed, only thing
you have to do really, religiously is to
meditate. It is not that at night I come very
late, so I did not meditate or tomorrow I have
to go for work so I cannot meditate. Nobody
wants to know the excuses, it is between
you and yourself. It is your gain, nobody
else's. It is for your gain everything has
happened.
Now for us to worship Adishakti, I
don't know, because there has been no
prayers or anything about Adishakti. Up to
Bhagwati they have gone. Beyond Bhagwati
they have not gone. So I don't know what
sort of puja you will have! But let's try
something. May be, I think, the meditation is
the best way we can really achieve
something. So we can go into meditation for
about five minutes.
Now one has to know that we have
achieved a certain height of relations and
from inside you might go up to here, up to
here, up to here, not saying it is not possible
to do that. But first and foremost thing that
whatever you may be, may consider you to
be a very high class Sahaja Yogi, you have
to be humble about meditation. This
meditative quality, even when I am talking
to you on the Sahasrara, I am getting into it
because it is so joy giving. You just jump into
the ocean of Joy. First it will be difficult, but
after sometime you will know that this
connection, that you have with Shri Mataji is
the only connection that you were looking
"Please close your eyes. (Shri Mataji
raises the Kundalini of all present, She blows
Pranava for eleven times) Eleven rudras are
awakened and they will destroy all that is
negative. Now ignorance is the greatest
force. I am sure they will destroy this
ignorance of people."
May God bless you.

expressions outside.
(Today we have decided to have a Hamsa
Puja in Germany. We have never yet paid
much attention to this center of Hamsa
We are the people in the West, who always
try to express ourselves outside. It's very
important how you look, it's very important
which is, I think, very important for the
Western world rather than for the Indian or
where you look, what you look, what you see.
the Eastern. The reason is, at the Hamsa
Chakra part of the Ida and Pingla come out
and manifest. It means the expression of Ida,
Pingla is given through the Hamsa Chakra.
So this Hamsa Chakra is the one) After the
Agya what is holding on certain threads or
certain parts of the Ida and Pingla, and they
start flowing through your nose, expressing
through yours eyes, from your mouth and
from your forehead. So you know that
Vishuddhi Chakra has got sixteen petals
which look after the eyes, nose, throat,
tongue, teeth, but the expression part comes
through the Hamsa Chakra, of all these. So,
it's a very, very important thing in a Western
mind to understand Hamsa Chakra. There's
a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit:-
It's very important that your appearance
should be good. Very particular. They spend
lots of time in improving their appearances.
This is the minimum. Then they have a
method by which, we call the media, the
country speaks or manifests through the
media. And the medias have to have a
training. Every country has a speciality, and
one better then the other. And when you see
all of them, you find they lack discretion
completely. Also, in our speech, in our
expression of literature, expression of poetry,
expression of our relationships with others,
any kind of expression requires discretion,
which is a deepseated knowledge or
wisdom.
If, in the West, people were not so much
outside, they would have been much better
off, I think. If, supposing, in England, people
don't become punks, then others will laugh
at them, and they'll think that this man has
no money to become a punk. So a kind of a
fashion that sets in, in a society of that kind,
which has no discretion and which is very
outward. Fashions won't work out in
countries where they are deeply rooted into
traditions, and into proper understanding of
life. Of course, the countries which have
been very ancient have been traditionally
trying to improve themselves with error and
trial, and error and trial methods, have
developed much better discretion, much
better understanding. But the countries
which are not gone through all that ordeals
have not worked out, have not gone through

Meaning the crane and the swan,
both are white. And what makes the
difference between the two? If you mix the
water and the milk together, the Hamsa will
just suck in the milk. So it can discriminate
between the water and the milk, while, the
Bakah, means the crane, cannot. It's a very
significant thing for Sahaja Yogis to
understand. Discretion is to be understood
very deeply within ourselves, and how we
develop discretion is very important in
Sahaja Yoga. But before we go to that, let
us see how this discretion plays a part very
much in the manifestation of our

idea. In that also there has to be
discretion. What conditioning is good
and what is not good has to be taken.
Now because there is no discretion about
conditioning also, outright discarding all
traditions all that is coming to us through our
experiences of our forefathers, everything is
discarded. The history is discarded, and we
say, Oh, no, we are beyond it, we feel free.
Like I was surprised, yesterday, in the plane
somebody told me, I feel very free whenl
have no clothes upon my body. I mean, if
the clothes can imprison you, then what
happens to the real prisons, what will they
be for you? But that sort of a funny idea
comes into the head of people and they think
that we can justify all this stupidity that we
follow because we lack discretion.
all that discipline, lack in discretion. And that's
why many of the people, though they are of
very deep seeking, have gone astray. If they
had discretion they would not have gone
astray, they would not have gone to wrong
places. But the discretion was missing.
So it comes to the discretion how to
use your Ida Nadi and Pingla Nadi, and
discretion tounderstand what is good and
what is bad.Now let us see the Ida Nadi.
Ida Nadi is very important because the
discretion in this can only come through
traditional understanding. Ida Nadi starts
from the Ganesha's point, Mooladhara. So
first, we miss the biggest support, the
biggest help, the biggest nourishment of
holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara
if we have no discretion. We always take to
thing which are detrimental to our growth and
also which may destroy us, not only us, but
the whole country. We like people who are
destructive when there is no discretion.
Intelligence cannot give you discretion; it
cannot give you discretion as far as the
conditioning is concerned. For a Sahaja Yogi
it is important to understand how you develop
your discretion. Yesterday only I gave a very
beautiful talk to the ladies of Paris, or I should
say, the ladies of France, regarding the
discretion of women.
Discretion means that you must
choose the things which are good for you.
Which are benevolent to you, which are good
for the collective, which are good for your
ascent. On the contrary, the people who
have no discretion fall into the traps of wrong
type of people. Like say, Freud. I mean, to
an Indian, Freud, nobody can believe that you
can go into such a nonsensical idea! But
people accepted Freud more than they could
accept Christ, because the discretion was
completely missing. If they had that
traditional discretion in them, they would have
been saved. It is that traditinal discretion is
the thing that comes through Ida Nadi.
The discretion of the Ida Nadi is
intuition. If you develop that discretion within
you, through your meditative powers, you
develop intuition. And intuition is nothing but
is the help of the Ganas which are
surrounding you. If you learn to take help
from the Ganas you can become very
intuitive, and without much intelligence of
yours, you can say the right thing. The whole
of Sahaja Yoga, I would say fifty percent at
least out of that, is based on intuition. For
that you have to develop a proper sense of
Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh in its right sense
you have to understand. From there starts
because He is Ganapati, He is the one who
is the master, He's the chief of all the Ganas.
So the Ganas give you the intuition. For
Now that's what the people call it as
conditioning, and they say that conditioning
is very bad, and people should not take to
conditioning, and one should be free from
conditioning, which is absolutely a wrong

"Hamsa,' is made of two types of discretions,
where to see 'l am', and where to see 'You
are'. On these two balances, as they are
shown here beautifully, the Moon and the
Sun, in the center is the Cross which gives
you the balance, which gives you the
Dharma. How all these things are connected
one after another, layers after layers! You
can see, how dharma is connected with
discretion!
example, say I have to go somewhere, and
then what I say is that, No, I won't be able to
go there tomorrow. And I won't go, somehow.
Then people think, Mother, how do you know?
I know because the Ganas are there and
what they say is the truth, they know all about
it. Or anything I say about someone comes
true. So they start asking me, How is it
Mother you have come to know about it? I
live on intuition. Like I have to catch a plane,
I know by intuition, what's going to happen.
This part has to develop by worshipping Shri
Ganesh.
Now, there are people who are
suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual.
For example, I have seen some Sahaja
Yogis, they come to the puja and they are
giving bandhans to themselves like mad. On
the way they'Il go, they'll give bandhans.
Anywhere they go they'll give bandhan, like
mad. That's just conditioning, that's not
discretion, that's not Sahaja Yoga. It is to
be seen, is it to be given bandhan or
not? In the presence of Mother there in
bandhan. Whatis there to give bandhan
to yourself? But people, when I am talking,
are giving bandhan, raising their Kundalini.
They're all mad people, I think. In the same
way, there are people, yesterday, I heard
there's one kind of a music record is played
everywhere in the ashrams, because they
can all jump like on a camel; it's music for
the camels, you see. Now, this record
everybody appreciates. Why? Because they
can jump like a camel. Önce you start
jumping like a camel, human being can't give
up, they form habits. So they like that
particular music. They will go on jumping like
a camel because now they have become
camels, they have to behave like camels.
And then there is something-some music-
which is like a horse, like the trot-may be,
may be done, anything. Now once they listen
to it, suddenly they start following that
rhythm. Now they become the horse which
is running. Now the horse is galloping. They
So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules
a part of the Hamsa Chakra. So when we
say 'Ham' and 'Sa', these two are actually
the Bija Mantras of the Agya. But when the
Agya touches the Hamsa it starts here.
That's why at the base, at the root of it is the
Hansa. And here the Ham (Ham means, "I
am.") If you are discreet, you will not take to
fashions, you'll not take to stupid ideas. You
have you own personality, you are a Sahaja
Yogi. You don't listen to people who are non-
Sahaja Yogis. That is the 'Ham' part, I am.
Not the ego part, but the 'Ham' to understand
that, "I am a Yogi, and I know so many things
which normally people don't know and sol
have nothing to do with them. I've not to take
any lessons from them.
They're not to teach me anything.
There's nothing that they know. I know much
more." To be aware of yourself is 'Ham'.
So that comes from the right side, I would
say.
The discretion of right side is
"Ham,' and the discretion of the left side
is 'Sa.' 'Sa' means 'You', means 'you are
the one.' In your case, you know who is
the 'you'. But for every human being, 'You'
is the 'Divine.' "You are the one'. This comes
from the left side, is 'Sa.' So the word,

the goud, can come to you if you develop
that Liscretion part.
become horses, and they only like that
galloping music. So on and so forth; could
be a donkey, could be anything.
In Sahaja Yoga, at every stage you'll
find people falter also with the right side
indiscretion. And the right side indiscretion
comes from the ego manifestation of people.
This ego, as I said, is 'Ham.' This ego doesn't
work when it has to work. For example, I find
some people went for a marriage in the
church. Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja
Yogis, We don't belleve in any human
religions, you know that. All right, you went
to the church, it's all right. But they sent a
lady to London to buy Laura Ashley dresses,
to buy, and I think also, maybe some men
must be wearing tailcoats to do the wedding.
Where is that ego lost? That ego that you
are a Sahaja Yogi was completely lost. I think
they all went for hair dressing, all kinds of
things they did, and they all wanted to go
there as old Christians, walking to the church
next to the graves of stupid bishops.
It's not only here, India is much worse,
as far as religion is concerned, the left side,
We are not animals, we are human
beings, and we are 'Ham,' 'We Are,' we are
Sahaja Yogis. We are not dominated by any
particular type of rhythm, or particular type
of music. Every variety we can appreciate
and understand, as long as it is dharmic, as
long as it is balanced, as long as it is
auspicious and holy. So you can see on the
Hamsa, how many things are judged. I think
the whole of Sahaja Yoga stands on the
balance of Hamsa. There are people who
are very astute, means very honest, but this
honesty can go into a ridiculous limit. Or
else, there are people who are very hard
working. This can also go to the ridiculous
limit. So these qualities which are supposed
to be good, cannot be righteous. 'The
righteousness is discretion glorified."
If you have discretion, then you glorify
that discretion into righteousness. Like you
can say now, Christ, you can take Christ.
Christ was such a discretion. When Mary they are very, very conditioned people, and
Magdalene was stoned, He had nothing to
do with prostitutes, I mean, nothing to do at
all, no relationship, but He could see, in Jananadeva, he was such a great
discretion, that these people had no
business to stone her. He stoad up there, in
His own courage, and He said that, Those
who have not committed any sins can throw
the stones at Me. This is the power of His
discretion, that people just felt that discretion
within themselves, and they felt that in Jananadeva had no shoes! What shoes are
discretion, This man is a Holy man and we
cannot throw stones at Him? If you are
discreet as Sahaja Yogis, you will make
others discreet also. Others will have to be
discreet and to understand. And this 'Neer
Khsheer Vivek' is the differentiation
between the water and the milk, the bad and
there they fail to understand what is
discretion. For example, we had
incarnation, and he didn't even have shoes
on his feet. And these days they are taking
out a big procession of palanquin, so-called
shoes in it of Shri Jananadeva, and
thousands and thousands of people singing
praise. Just imaginel Who can tell them that
you carrying in the palanquin? And whichever
village they go or whatever city they go, they
are fed with sumpuous food, everybody falls
at their feet. The saints have come with a
planquin.' And the shoes never belonged
Jananadeva in it.
So this madness goes on. Now you

see all these things happening around you.
In every country, in every religion, in every
stupid area, you'll see all this happening. But
you just join hands. You become one with it
and then it becomes so difficult to
understand what has happened to you. Now
this ego, when used properly, then, is
discretion. Now also, people have another
very horried, horried conditioning, apart from
the religion, is of the countries. 'I belong to
India, I belong to Germany, I belong to
England.' 'Everything is wretched! I mean,
to say something like that means you are
not yet grown up to the Sahasrara Land.
Those who start becoming some
nationality do not know that your
nationality is transformed. Actually, you
don't need any passports in the area where
the Divine reigns, no passport is needed. It's
written large on your faces. But still, inside,
this deep conditioning is there, that 'I belong
to this country. My country is very great. Your
country's not good. 'But when it comes to
discretion is to think that, 'All right I was born
in Germany, and Germany has made lots of
mistakes. Let me work it out. So that I get
back all my German people into the area
where resides peace, joy and happiness.
There is, this conditioning is used in
discretion. In everything you will find
there are two sides. Which way you move
is your discretion.
Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing is Jew.'
Same with Christians, same with other
communities, same with any other
nationality.
Now what is the discretion when you
seek? The best thing, discretion at that point
is to see what are the faults of these so-
called human religions which are formed
after the death of the promoters, or, we can
say, the incarnations or the prophets who
started that religion? This is first discretion.
The second discretion is to read those
scriptures and find out what is so special
that these incarnations have said. For I
would say, if there is a Muslim, he should
go to Koran and see what's written in
Koran as far as Sahaja Yoga is
concerned. If it's a Christian, let him go to
the Bible and find out whatever is written
there as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,
because Sahaja Yoga is the truth, and what
truth is written has to be found out. If such a
thing is developed, then you can go further,
if you are brave enough, and can be
courageous to go and tell the people, that,
'See, what is this nonsense you are
following? It's not written, it's not done.
Whatever is written, this is the essence of
the whole thing. That's the third stage, where
you have used your discretion as far as a
particular religion, nationality is concerned.
Now when I am, say, in the West, I
have to discuss the West and when I am in
For example, there are people who
have a conditioning of a particular say, a
religion. Supposing they belong to the Jew
religion, and have come to Sahaja Yoga or
they belong to Christianity and have come
to Sahaja Yoga. So now, what is the
discretion? As soon as another Jew person
comes or a Christian person comes in,
they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there,
and they'll all become great friends.
'Because he's Jew, I'm Jew, my father is
India, you must hear Me. You don't
understand the language, it is good for Me.
With all the respect for the Indians, I give
them left and right, and tell them what's
wrong with them. But here it is important that,
what is wrong with us in the West. So the
discretion is to see what's gone wrong with
us. Where are we wrong? Have we got any
courage or not?

all other people, 'Oh, I am lost on the way.

We are the people who are not to

of a saint. If you have seen any saint,
anywhere, they have gone all out to say
whatever is right, whatever is to be done,
and whatever is to be followed. That's the
sign of a saint. Otherwise you stand,
sometimes, just dissolved in the society,
sometimes in Sahaja Yoga, sometimes
here. Then what's the use of such saints?
And above all, the vibrations part,
which you have to see. If you do
something, if vibrations are going down,
then of course, 'l am a Sahaja Yogi, to
me vibrations and my ascent is the most
important thing.' So to develop the
discretion on the right-hand side, you have
to know your goal, your destination. You
must know on what path you're standing and
where you are brought. Where are you
today? We are not like other people. If that
kind of a discretion you develop within
yourself through pure intelligence -for that
you need pure intelligence. And pure
intelligence in a Hamsa is that it glides on

anything to overpower it. It's in the water

somebody, that the one who ran out of the
battlefield. So Shri Krishna ran out of the
battlefield, for there was no way out to kill
this horrible fellow. And He went, and He was
covering Himself with a shawl. He went into
that cave, and covered that saint with His

another side is Christ who starts looking
after the ego side of it. The one who says,
on the cross, 'Oh God, forgive them
because they do not know. Oh Father,

hunter in His hand and hits people, starts
beating them because they are making
money in the name of God. See the
discrelion. Same Shri Krishna who with his
Sudarshana Chakra can kill thousands and
thousands of rakshasas, becomes the driver
of Arjuna. The contrast of their behavior is
the beautiful saga of their discretion.

to understand that they have to work out their
discretion in a manner that they develop their
intuition. I would say the first thought could

be no ordeals, there should be all joy and
joy and ioy. But the discretion should be to
find out what are your weaknesses. Whether
have you done wrong? What's gone wrong?
Where? In what part and how you have
failed? Sometimes people think, 'Oh, we did
a lot at that time. Now we can't do it. "Then
be the intuition, could be the intuition. Could
be that this is intuition. Try. Experiment. But
going to the extremes of everything is
wrong in Sahaja Yoga, you have to do
everything in moderation. Like, I told them
to see, everything through vibrations; So they
will put their hands, I don't know, to everything.
'Should I buy this sari or not? Even go beyond
that, 'should I buy this face powder or not?"
It's so ridiculous! It's so bad that ultimately
you find that you have become a bhoot
and you are telling everbody that, 'Your
vibrations are bad, 'because your
vibrations are bad. Your attention is bad.
you have failed. Like I heard that people are
saying, 'Now we have come here, so we'll
not go to Guru Puja.' It's wrong. At any cost
you have to come for puja. I know I have
shown you place which is Andorra but not
Himalaya.
And, in Sahaja Yoga it is so
comfortable that we want that there should
be no change of flights. Directly we sit on a
Hamsa and we reach Andorra place. You will.
You will see that. But if you develop an habit
of thinking, 'Oh, it would be difficult, 'then it
will be." But as, Warren has said it, it is going
to be the easiest, everything is going to work
out.' Once you think like that it will work out.
Everything will work out. But first there should
be pure desire. Whenever such ideas come
into your head, again, use your discretion.
"We go to Guru Puja for our own help.' Every
Guru Puja, if you remember, you have come
up very much higher. Every Guru Puja has
helped you. Of course, you say that
Maharashtra tour is very good. I agree, it is.
Maharashtra tour helps you a lot. But that's
for thirty days, so intensive. Guru Puja is only
one day. How many pujas do you have in
Maharashtra? At least eight to nine.
Sometimes even ten. That's why, naturally,
it has to be much more effective. But Guru
Putting your attention to nonsensical
things, makes your vibrations absolutely
disappear. So with discretion you must
have common sense, practical sense. I've
seen people suddenly talking to anybody
about Sahaja Yoga. No, that's not practical.
Sahaja Yoga is a precious diamond.
You can not give it to every person. I've seen
people at the airport raising Kundalini of
everyone. No! It's not meant. They have to
come to Sahaja Yoga. They have to ask for
it. They have to beg for it. Then only they
can get their realization. We don't want
quantity, we want quality. All my lectures, if
you see in that I am insisting on the quality
of the Sahaja Yogis, and the quality of the
seekers. But when we start thinking of
getting a majority for a vote for Shri Mataji, I
have to say, I am not standing for any
election. Whether you elect me or not, l am
elected. You don't have to do that. I don't need
many people for that and when you fail in
discretion you find some problems develop.
Puja, itself, is extremely effective.
Indians have been asking me,
"Mother once, at least once more, give us
the Guru Puja.'We'll give anything to have a
Guru Puja. Please come. Even this time, they
wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine, you
could not have attended Guru Puja in India.
Now, it is for you to find out what
indiscreet things you have done. Where
have you gone wrong? In which way have
you done a mistake? It is for you to find out.
Then, rectify it. Otherwise in Sahaja Yoga,
there should be no problems, there should

bashfulness, he has that shyness, he has
that protocol, and he respects his body. Out
of respect of the body he doesn't want to do
something that will insult his body And that's
how if you understand how far to go and how
far to stop.
The more you start expressing your
love by all these gestures the less it is inside.
The more you give expression of, for
example, there's a method of expressing
'you, 'and you go on saying 'thank 'thanks,
thanks, thanks, thanks.' It's just a lip-service.
But many people in many countries don't say
thank you' at all. They're very grateful, inside.
The gratefulness, inside, creates the depth
that is necessary. So, to do it superficially,
anything, to much, has to be avoided in your
discretion. But avoiding extremes, avoiding
too much outward expression, again can
create another indiscretion. Like the English,
they don't speak. The just don't speak. You
travel with them every day for twentyfive
miles, sitting together, they will not say 'who
you are.' There is no insecurity about it, but
Then there is another way of
indiscretion in Sahaja Yoga which I have
seen, is that people start using Me in many
purposes like that. Like, supposing now
somebody's writing a poem, so he'll come
to me, he'll say, 'Please correct my poem.'I
will correct one poem, two poems, three
poems, ten poems, then he'll loose the
capacity to produce poems. You should not
use Me for your own purpose in that manner,
but in any case you are using Me. But with
the understanding that 'Mother is all the
time with me, and is helping me, "there's
no need to come forward and jump on

everybody sees it and knows it, that it is
there. So for all of you, it is important to
develop your discretion today and to ask
Me to reside in your Hamsa Chakra so
that you are all the time stationed in the
power of discretion. With discretion we
have evolved to human state, and to go
further we have to develop our innate
discretion, which I think is the essence of all
the religion, of all the adventures we have
had, of all the lives which we have known. Is
the discretion around which everything
My time, and to take My time, and to
bother Me, so that I should feel, 'Oh God,
when will I get rid of this? Or others have
a thing, 'Mother you must come to my house,
you must take my child, you must meet my
husband, he might be a drunkard.' So taking
attention to what you call, 'yours' is also
indiscretion.
Instead of that, you put your attention
to Me, instead of taking My attention to you.
It's a very delicate line, as if we are walking
on a sword. It's a very, very delicate line of
discretion, but once you know as a state
within yourself, you are discreet, you cannot
be indiscreet even if you want to be. And that
is what is the ascent part, So once you
come out of this chakra and pass through
moves.
May God bless you all.

May God bless you all.
your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara, where
you have to be discreet. Whatever then
comes out from there, is blessed. Whatever
expression comes out is blessed. From the
Sahasrara is all discreet and beautiful.
So much can be said about discretion,I
mean it is endless. How far can we go? In
all your decision making, in everything, you
have to be discrete. It is Divine-Discretion.
So much can be said about discretion that
there is no end to it. As you know in these
Some people have a habit of
dominating Me, also. Like, I'm talking, they'll
talk in between. If I'm saying something, they
will talk. Then I play tricks. I'm good at playing
tricks, but l'm very discreet. So it's all right.
My discretion plays the tricks, because we
have directly mobilized it. So better to be
discreet and play tricks. In everything that
we do discretion expresses itself. And if you
are a solid Sahaja Yogi or a Sahaja Yogini,
your discretion is evident in every way, and
days of confusion it is the discretion that is
going to take us to our right direction. So the
discretion is important in every of our
decision making and understanding the
small things and big things and everywhere,
discretion that is the Divine Understanding,
we have to have.
May God Bless You.

 MOTHER
My Mother has the radiance of the Sun and the Moon,
and Her eyes are the glory of the Universe.
Her diadem is set with the Sun, the Moon & Stars
and Her crown is ablaze with cosmic Love & Purity.
Her ornaments are the devotions of Her children
and She is the supreme Ishwari, the Parameshwari-of all that is,
She is the source flood of humankind
and the source flood of all existence.
From Her feet humankind takes birth and all the universes their existence,
She is the source of of all that is, and bliss transcending all experience.
From Her Nabhi flows auspiciousness in a divine milky flood.
From Her heart flows auspiciousness in hot fierce and protecting blood.
Surrounding to protect Her own, raised to pinnacles unknown and heights beyond all others.
She is the source of all devotions, of prayer and virtuous acts.
She is the poetry of the soul, its light and comprehension,
She is awareness of the earth, of cosmic second birth
Of virtue, liberation and the end; eternal unbroken and without end.
Her throat is like a pale blue star-in which is held the cosmic sound
Light and protection from the fumes of hell; and cosmic poison's futile wrath.
Within it divine souls take birth and angels praise in cosmic dance-
their divine all-embracing Lord,
But She alone is above it all, and in sweet play fullness holds it tight.
Her forehead is smooth and clear, radiant like the snowy mountain's brow;
Ablaze with cosmic light and love-pure compassion's eternal birth;
Ablaze with the crest of supreme worth, arranged to set the worlds to right,
Culminating in a snowy cap, the liberation of countless earths.
Beycnd it, above, Her being ascends,
Cosmic eternal all-embracing.
Withcut form yet always there,
The universe's unimaginable light.
Beyond meaning, beyond thought-
beyond the Gunas, and all matter.
There She exists, the eternal Lord,
Parabrahma without end.
When this heart of mine beholds Her-
automatically of itself gets up:
And playing with the fingers of its own desire-
on the strings of its cosmic love
Singing of its pure existence and its devotion's unending flood,
uncontrollable sings on, hymns of radiancejoyandlove, devotion inexpressible and radiant-
At seeing its Mother's enternal worth; and seeing its Mother's eternal Love.

 EASTER PUJA
3 April, 1988
Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
is for you to resurrect other people. You can
resurrect other people. This is the power.
You have got it. Through Him, maybe, or
through your Kundalini, but you have this
power to resurrect other people.
Today we are here to celebrate the
resurrection of Christ. Resurrection of Christ
has the greatest significance for all the
Sahaja Yogis. And we have to understand
that He resurrected Himself so that we could
resurrect ourselves. The message of His
life is His resurrection and not His cross.
He bore the cross for us and we don't
have to bear anymore. I see lots of people
having this drama going on. They are
carrying the cross across to show as if we
are going to do the job for Christ, as if He
has left some work to be done by these
people who play a drama! But all this drama
is to deceive yourself and to deceive others.
There's no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered. To make
you weep and to make you cry Christ did
not suffer. He suffered that you should enjoy,
that you should be happy. that you should
lead a life of complete bliss and gratitude to
the Almighty who has created you. He would
never like you to be unhappy. Which father
would like his son to be unhappy?
But first and foremost thing you have
to be strong like Christ. How He obeyed His
Mother and how He denied all the demands
of His life! How He was committed and how
He dedicated Himself to this a single task.
He didn't bother as to develop His monetary
side ar to become some sort of a big officer
or to become another great rider or a
swimmer, or climb on the Alps, some sort
of a thing like that. He didn't try all these
tricks, and didn't try to hanker after all these
things that sometimes make us quite mad.
What He did was to establish His identity as
the Brahma itself, as the Divine Vibrations
itself, which He established.
What you have to do is to establish
yourself as the resurrected people, as the
realized souls, as the Sahaja Yogis. And this
is going to be very easy. Now everything is
made easy for you -your realization, then
your powers--everything has beautifully
settled within you. It has worked out so
beautifully, slowly and steadily. I don't think I
have ever tried to force you to do something
or have compelled you to do something. But
through your own ascent you can see what's
wrong with you or with the people abot
whom we are talking. And then you can also
know through all these powers whatever is
to be known. All that is unknown can be your
So we have to understand that His
message of His life, why He came on this
earth to do the greatest job is that of
resurrection. If He had not resurrected
Himself, I could not have worked out Sahaja
Yoga. So we have to be eternally thankful to
His life and to Him. That the way He did all
these difficult tasks, taking upon Himself that
we cannot do, we human beings cannot do

And I was very anxious that we should have

not very suitable, because those days the
moon would be waning. So I thought how
will I do it without the moon. We have to have

gradually it became pink like your faces. It's
beautiful, become pink, beautifully pink, and
then now it's shining. I'm sorry I should have
given full tribute to the Sun, the way He has
acted. So that's why He is troubling Me a
little bit, just to remind Me.
So, as you know, the Sun is the Agya
Chakra. Christ resides in the Sun. And in the
body, in the being, He is the Spirit. When
He's the Spirit, He's the moon and when He
acts on the Agya He's the Sun. Now we have
seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate. He had no defects
in Him. He was a perfect personality. Then
why did He want to resurrect, one can ask?
What is in His time is the resurrection? His
resurrection is like making the way through
the Agya Chakra; for all of you to pass
through it. He was like the gate, or we should
say He was the One who opened the gate
for all of you. Because He was so perfect.
He had no problems as we have of our
Chakras, our Kundalini. He fad no problems.
But He was the complete compassion of, in
the nature of vibrations. Vibrations became

every night, every time they announced about
the weather, it was looking even worse,
every time. So I thought, now what to do? If
you ask the clouds to move out, you have to
have a tremendous breeze and that may
spoil your tent. So somehow or other, you

even when He was resurrected and even
before that when He was crucified, He said
that, "Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know
what they are doing." Such forgiveness, such
compassion, and the Mother had to watch
all that, keeping quiet because that was the
game, that was the thing one has to do. He
had to play His game and He played it so
well.
And then the sun which was very
bright came out. Early in the morning I saw
Him, red like My sari, so beautiful it was! You
were all asleep but I was awake, very early.

like My bindi it came up. I saw it, I said look

So now when we talk about Christ,
we have to remember one thing that He has
done all this for us. Now what are we going
to do for Him? He is the pattern we have to

anything else. Our lives are for
meditation. You need not spend all your
twenty-four hours, but you have to

you meditate your children will meditate.
And meditation is such a simple
thing, for you made so easy that all the

difficult for Me and for you to achieve
for which you have come on this earth.
It's tremendous task that I have taken over. I
know that. But I know how to do it and you
also know how to do it but the trouble is you
get entangled into your different conditionings.
We have to understand the
importance of our being, of our lives, like
Christ understood that He has come for this
great job here. And though He came as a
human being, though He came as an
ordinary son of an ordinary carpenter, though
on this earth He had a body and He lived like
other human beings, still He knew what He
had to do. He knew what He had to achieve
and He achieved it. I think His was the most
difficult task, which He achieved and which
He finished it so well that today we are
having all the benefits of that.

all these so-called religions in anybody's

only one truth and that is: all these great

should examine ourselves. What have
we done for Sahaja Yoga? Not carrying

when they travel in India and if they carry the
luggage of people downward they are
carrying the cross of Christ. That's not the
way. It's something very, very serious one
has to think about. And that seriousness is,
how far we have achieved that state, for
that what have we done? And a simple
thing I've been asking all of you you

sorry you see, we cannot offer you meat
because our fasting is there, but we'll have
lunch." So we had a very sumptuous lunch
and all that. But the priest, was only busy
drinking. Because it was a fasting, so
drinking is allowed, according to them. So
he's drinking and drinking and drinking. He
drank so much that he forgot we were there.
We were supposed to be VIPS, you see, he
just lost himself into drinking! So we thought
better now have an honorable retreat, you
see, so we got up and walked out of that
place and that fellow didn't even come to wish
us and these officers, the Russian officers,
didn't drink, they didn't do anything, and they
were laughing and laughing. He said, "See
now, this is Christianity that's why we didn't
want to take to Christianity." So I said, "But
see, that's not Christ." They said, That's true,
but what is these people are saying, is it
Christianity?" I said, "It is not." Now this
gentleman, you see, was supposed to be
the highest person in spirituality living in

restrictions.' Even in Hinduism, you will be
surprised, there are so many restrictions! If
you see the amount of superstitions that exist
and that are created by Brahmins in India
you will be shocked. For everything there is
a superstition, If you walk with the left hand
ahead, that means this, if you walk with the
right hand, then that means this. If you sit
like this, that means that. Everything-they
have made a human being into a machine
and there's no spontaneity about it. All kinds
of absurdities there are in Islam too.But
when we find them in a free place like
England, where there is complete left-
sidedness, where you can do what you like,
still you are a Christian! You drink, it's all right,
you have ten wives, it's all right, you have
fifteen keeps, it's all right! Anything you do is
all right as long as you go to church and pay
money!
So there's nothing you see,
especially for the Protestants--that's the
religion I was born in-where everything is
allowed. Now when we come to this kind of
a thing what is the Christian religion is then
comes to that, if you ask them the road, then
they'll tell you which way to go, that's
Christianity. It's coming to that end.
So they told Me a story about the
czars. You see czars wanted to have some
religion because they thought everybody's
having a religion, we have no religion, we
must, have some religion. So they sent for
some people and the people who came
forward were Catholics to begin with. So the
Catholics said, "All right, you can drink in
Catholic religion." I don't know how they got
this idea, but it's all right. In Catholic religion
you can drink but you cannot have more than
one wife. The czar said, "No, that's not
possible, we have to have many czarinas,
you see, for different purposes, so we can't
have that religion. So they cancelled it. So
then the Islam, you see that time, I think, there
were no Hindus available, thank God. They
had Islam. Isiam people went and the Islamic
people said "No, all right you can have five
Now, all these religions either are
indulging into right side or into the left side.
Some people like the left side and some
people like the right side. I will tell you the
story of a priest. I went to see him in Russia.
I think I have told it to some people before. I
went to Russia and the Russian people
asked Me, "What would you like to see?" So
I told them I would like to go and see some
churches. They said, "All right, very good,
we'll take you to a church." So they took Me
to church and it was about that Greek
Orthodox Church, you see, and the Black
Order which is supposed to be the highest.
I don't know how they call it. So we went

Now we are all identified with our so-
wives, it's all right, but you cannot drink. They
said, "That's impossible. How can we follow
Islam? That's not possible." So, it's
cancelled. So these orthodox people,
orthodox, you see, the word orthodox
remember that, they came. They said "You
see we are just in the centre, you see. We
don't mind if you drink, we don't mind if you
have many wives, we don't mind. Only thing
is you have to pay us well." Czar said, "Al
right, that's good, let's have this religion." and
that's how they had this religion there.
called religions in which we were born. For
example, if I told Indians now you don't go to
temples, you're not to go to any temple, even
if it is a swayambhu temple, unless and until
you have told Me, don't go to a swayambhu
temple at any cost. There are many
churches also where there are very good
statues, we can say, or have got something
which are really swayambhus, but there are
very few. So you tell Me and then go. But
they won't listen to Me, they won't listen, and
when they go there, they catch on their
Agyas.
So this is the situation of the religion
today. All these religions have become sort
of deformed statues, good-for-nothing. So
now the inner religion within is the Sahaja
Dharma which has to be fully followed. Now,
I told, say in India, that now we are all
become Sahaja. The story is like this, that
there was a villager who became Christian.
So he came down to Allahabad to become
Christian. So he told them that you have to
give me a big name because now I'm Sahib
and I have become English man. So you
better give me a big name. They said, "What
name you want?" He said "Give me the name
of Alexander the Great." So they called him
Alexander, but his name was Blondie, you
see, His real Indian name was Bhoora, so
they called him Alexander Bhoora. So Mr.
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and
went to the river Ganges for having his bath.
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, "You
can't do that." He said, "Why can't I do that?"
He said, "No, you can't go to have bath in
the river Ganges because the Christianity
will drop out, you see." If he goes and has a
bath in the river Ganges. He said, "This you
can't do." So Alexander Bhoora said, "If I have
become sahib, I have become Englishman,
that doesn't mean I have given up my
religion." You see, this is exactly what is
happening to us when we try to follow
any religion whatsoever.
OnceI went to see one temple which
was of course a swayambhu temple, no
doubt. So some Sahaja Yogis decided to go
there, but I didn't ask them, they didn't tell
Me. When they came back, as soon as they
saw Me, they all fainted. I said, "What
happened? Where did you go?" "Oh, we went
to this temple." I said, "Why? You never told
Me. What do you have there? See, the
Brahmin put the tika and it's finished." Then
it took them one month to clear out. Now
they don't go. They had enough of it. Same
with the Christians. Now the other day I heard
about the Paris episode where people
wanted to have weddings in the church in
Paris. So they must have special dresses.
Somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from... What shop is that? What
name? Some big name. So the special
dresses must be worn because they have
to go to the church. And when they came
out of the church with those dresses, they
had become bhoots. I was surprised. What
has happened to these twenty-five of them?
What has happened is that in the
church there are many dead bodies buried.
They are all caught up. So when you go also
to see the beautiful architecture, go with a
detached mind. Don't think that you belong
to that church. Don't belong to any church.

will do it. I don't know what happens.
When it comes to falsehood, we
try to follow it and when we know the
truth--this is the truth--then we take
advantage and we try to compromise. We
think the truth will not do anything about
it. Not that the truth wil punish you. It will
not. Because you are realized souls it
will not. It will not punish you up to a
point. But remember that Ekadasha is

you do anything wrong, like these people

And I have to tell you today that Christ
did not belong to any religion. He didn't follow
any religion. He followed His own spiritual
religion. When He went to one church where
there were people who were discussing they
were the Jews. He went there and He was
talking to them. The other day I saw a
beautiful painting they had given in the
newspaper, a very beautiful famous painting
where Christ is talking to the doctors and
He is holding His, rubbing His left
Swadishthan very nicely and all the doctors,
you see, one of them is listening to Him, one
of them is looking at Him, staring at Him,
another one is little bit paying attention to
Him. He's just rubbing His left Swadishthan.
caught up.
Now they may say that, "Mother,
why should we be caught up? We are
Sahaja Yogis." Because you are
vulnerable. You are vulnerable. Yet you
have not reached that stage. If you reach
that stage, then when you go there, all the
church people will come out of the church
and run away. They'll start shaking before
you. They will not know what has happened.
T have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start doing chat, chat, chat, chat,
chat, and people start wondering what has
happened. Even when they are having a
candlelight dinner, I am surprised the way
every candle starts flickering. And people
start looking because the bhoots are sitting
before them. You see. So the candles
immediately show that there are the bhoots
sitting here. With all this knowledge that you
It's clear, can see it so clearly, and
so now with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and must
understand that we have to be very
independently looking at ourselves. We are
no more belonging to any religion. We
belong to the religion of God which is Sahaja.
And Sahaja is the religion, it will spread only
when you really become nothing but Sahaja.

you find, I mean all, everyday you see and
you say, "Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!" Decadency is because
an individual whom you have given all these
powers has no power to bear them. An
individual cannot bear money. He cannot
bear power of any kind. He cannot bear love.
He cannot bear kindness. He cannot
understand peace because he's still an
individual.
like. It's the individual that's important. The
individual indulges into everything and you
should not stop him from doing whatever he
likes. He is an individual, so he has a right to
out his nose, he has a right to out his eyes,
to do what he likes. An individual is allowed
to do what he likes to do, and then what
happens? That we find this democracy
becomes a demonocracy. Everybody is a

demon.
throats, cutting all the basis and the roots of
life because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality, because the individual
is so great and the collective is lost,
completely lost.
But when an individual becomes the
collective, this is the ascent through the
central path. When he becomes the
collective, in his strength he strengthens the
collective and also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual. This is
what Sahaja Yoga is. So the politics of
Sahaja Yoga is that you have to become the
collective personality and there where we
feel that still we are something great, we are
different, we are Indians or we are from
England, or France, still if we are identified,
then you are not collective.
But on the other side, where it is
more disciplined, more aggressiveness,
more controls and everything the right side
which we can call as communism, where
people have control all the time. Now why?
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice. In that case, the individuals
become weak and if the individuals are weak,
then the collective cannot be strong. It cannot
be strong. Individual has to be strong. For
example, if you will see that, the people who
come from communist countries, they drink
more than people who can drink here, Or
those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don't touch anything,
can drink more than even Sardarjis. So you
can imagine what is the situation of human
beings is that out of fear if you try to control
him he goes to the right side. But he is in no
way perfect. He is not transformed, he
doesn't accept the situation. He doesn't
become that, he doesn't have that power to
control himseif. He doesn't get over his
sitting aptitudes. He's still there. As soon as
he gets a chance he falls into it. So that fails.
So the individuals are weak in that case.
In collective sense we are all one,
part and parcel of one being. Then you are
really acting as collective being and you are
one with the Divine, where the sun is looking
after you, the moon is looking after you, the
winds are looking after you and the Mother
Earth and all these elements they are
working. Ether, everything is working for you
and you are so well-protected and blessed
by this special quality to enjoy the joy. Then
you really become sensitive to that joy, when
you are one with the whole. Like if supposing
this finger or this finger is not one with the
whole, is numbed out as it happens in
leprosy. What happens is that this finger
becomes numbed out. Even if a rat eats it
off we don't know because there is no
connection, no nerves acting, it's insensitive.
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective,
you're going to be droped out. You're
And where there is complete
abandonment, do what you like, live the way

all have to be aware of our Selves.

is so similar between Me and the Spanish. I
think the love in My heart is expressed on
My face, perhaps. I hope the women of Spain

others.

One thing we have to realize is that
Sahaja Yoga is love and Divine Love. And

love of your fame. But is the love of the

not accept it because this dirt and filth
is covering your diamond. This is what
we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga.
Then once you shine with that brilliance,
nobody has to say with a vow that it is a
diamond. You are; nobody can doubt that
brilliance. Nobody likes a person who is a
fake, who is impure, who is unrighteous to
talk about God. Everyone wants reality. Only
thing is that they should see the reality in
you, or you should manifest your reality

place if you really try to witness everything

Once it is discqvered that we are detached

get your light, the sunlight, all the fog
disappears. In the same way, as soon as
you get Spirit shining in your attention, all your

 KRISHNA PUJA
16-8-1998, Cabella
Pravachan of Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
do we react to this kind of horrible hatred for
another community or another colour which
is only skin-deep.
Today we are going to have Shri
Krishna Puja.
It is a very important thing about the
power of Shri Krishna that gives you a
witness state, This is very important also
because, in these days of Kali Yuga and
complete confusion of value system, all
kinds of turmoil make a very complex
condition to exist.
Now with rationality you might be able
to explain: "O God, these people, they are
absolutely useless", or "They have come to
our country and are just troubling us." All
these conditionings are there. But if you see,
when they talk of immigrants, the Americans
must know theēy are immigrants all of them.
America never was their country. And they
threw away all the other Red Indians, took
away their land and very nicely they are the
owners of America. But the reaction is:
"Those who are not white-complexioned,
they are all to be condemned, tortured."
The state of witnessing is only
possible through meditation. You reach the
state of thoughtless awareness. It is
combined together. Now the witness state
is such a state where you just do not react.
If you react, then the problem starts. It's a
very simple thing to understand that we react
through our ego or through our conditioning.
Otherwise there is no way to react.
Now if they are by nature violent, then
also this conditioning of violence comes in.
Then they start killing each other. They have
killed ruthlessly so many people, thinking that
they have a right to go into any country and
kill everyone and take the land that is not their
own. Actually, land doesn't belong to
anybody as such. But no body has the right
to go, defy it and throw away the people who
do not belong to that country.
Anything, now for example, there is
a beautiful carpet here. As soon as I look at
it, if I use My ego l'll start thinking: "Now from
where did they get it? How much they paid
for it?" This is the first reaction. Then you
can even go further with it, anger can come
in: "Why did they bring such a nice carpet?
What was the need to put it here?" It goes
on like that, one after another. Now in My
conditioning, if I see these things, I would
say that: "This colour is not suited for Krishna
Puja, they should have had another colour
for this Krishna Puja." So this kind goes on
from one to another to another... But that
means this conditioning is built up within us.
Yesterday was the Independence
Day of India. And I have seen the flag going
up, our national flag, and the British flag going
down. All that has happened after so much
of struggle, so much of sufferings of the
people, because they came to India, landed
nicely there, and became the masters. So
this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way that you go into
anybody's country, throw away the people
from there as such and to occupy that place,
and become the masters. It's like going to
somebody's house, that belongs to
somebody, and throw away the people who
All our problems of our conditioning
are really horrible. For example, racialism..
We have racialism. In America it is very
much more, you can feel it, though they don't
say. But if you go from Italy, you feel it; if you
go from India also you can feel it.
is this racialism? What is the reason? Why

system, with your Spirit. We are here to
achieve our spirituality. This Spirit doesn't

superficial and it is so very cruel to condemn
someone for the colour.
are inside and nicely settle there as the
owners and the masters! Because they have
better intelligence, perhaps the cunning,
more in them. With that cunning, if the white
people think they can rule the black people,
is not where you can develop a witness
state. (can you take the baby out?.)
The same now is happening as a
reaction. Every action has a reaction. So
what happens is that you find the Blacks are
reacting. They are reacting and their reaction
can be very dangerous. Everyday I read their
reactions are coming up. So badly! Not in
America but all over, they are now thinking
they must rise and oppose this domination.
So this kind of conditioning is like a
plague and moves from one country to
another country where some people think
they are superior and make people look
inferior. And there are people also are there
who accept this kind of a situation, accept
this kind of a position, where they are
supposed to be equal.
But in their own countries, where
they have people of different colours, a little
variation I think, they are all black people but
little variation maybe, so they form groups.
And they start cutting each other's throats.
I've seen on the television, how ruthlessly
they kill! I don't know what is the difference
of colour is, but somehow they have formed
groups and this group will go and kill that
one and that group will come and kill this
one. It's not like Kauravas and Pandavas
It's not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it's not that the negative and the
positive is there, it's not. They are all negative,
whether they are White or Black. And they
start quarrelling and fighting with each other.
I would say, take the example of
America, because this has been celebrated
by Americans and because Krishna is the
ruler, Krishna is the ruler... of America. He
Himself was a dark person, Himself was on
the black side. And in the same country
where He rules, the another great thing is
that they don't realise that if all the blacks,
all the Asians get out of that country now, I
don't know what will happen to them! All their
sports are managed by the Blacks. If you
want to see any American sport, 99% are
black people. Then if you want to see also
the music, because these black people,
though they have black colour-which is
alright, as you are white, they have black
colour-, but they have a voice which the
white people don't have. They can sing so
well that no white people can compete with
them. It's the full justice done with the colour.
Now if you take out all the Asians, all the
doctors, all the nurses, all the architects, all
the accountants, all of them will disappear.
Now what will remain?
Now this violence is growing so
much. I think violence is the only weapon
they use now to express themselves. You
see, here something happens, so
somewhere there, you find they explode
bombs and kill so many innocent people. It
is very very sinful to do that. Even the
slightest violence is sinful and these kinds
of violences, in the eyes of Shri Krishna, are
absolutely to be punished very well.
Now this comes through ego. You
think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill. Or something like
You have to understand that it is

do with your intelligence, with your value

that, a funny idea into human mind comes
in and you decide that you have a right to kill
another person.
people who are now talking of humanity,
talking of peace, talking of joy are still
enjoying these violent acts, either they are
doing or they want to watch. So then you go
to these films and things that have been
created of a horrible violence, and people
enjoy it, enjoy such films and such films are
again created.
So one may say this comes from
hatred, but hatred is an outcome of ego.
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like
possessiveness, anger, violence, all this
starts coming out of the ego which actually
blinds the person. You become blind to the
fact that there is no need to have violence,
no need to hate someone, no need to kill
anyone because of this ego that is there.
hatred,
also
Now if you really become a witness
state, if you are in a witness state then what
will happen? If you watch any such things
that are happening, it will subside. If you are
in a witness state and in that level, then no
accident will take place in your sight. Even if
there is an accident, then you can save the
person, you can help the person very
actively. That's in a very small scale, but even
in a very large scale, you can do something
wonderful.
Now one may say: "Mother, how
does this ego build up?" Of course, mostly
it is due to reactions, also it is due to the
conditionings. If the child is told from the
childhood that: "You should hate these
people, they are to be hated, they are wrong
people, they are bad people", they just start
when they grow up, they start showing that
hatred. And it is now like a cactus growing
very big and is killing others. There is no
justification for this kind of a behaviour by
human beings. If they are human beings,
they have to have human qualities and that
is what is possible only if you learn how to
just witness and not to react.
I remember, I was not very old at that
time, but we were living in a house very
close to the Secretariate where they had a
strike. And they were asking for a separate
Maharashtra or something. So the police
was standing there and by the order of the
Chief Minister, they were shooting at
everyone who was coming, anyone who
passed through that road, they were
shooting, and they were enjoying the
shooting game, all of them. I saw all this and
I just couldn't bear it. I just went down and
For example you see two cocks are
fighting. You enjoy that! Two cocks are
fighting, people are enjoying. One cock dies,
they are very happy, as if the one which died
had killed his parents or did something like
that! It's very surprising. Now in Spain even
now there are these bull-fights going on.
Every year six bullfights, every year, and the

you'll be amazed, they stopped. Then I

that, called the ambulance and saved them.

here, and it is always full. And now the
women have taken to fight the bulls. Now if
the bull is not killed, they allow the bulls to
go on the streets and kill people. This kind
of a violent enjoyment is still lingering into
the minds of the people. It is so sad to see
There is no fear at all, once you
learn how to have the state of
witnessing. Because when you are not

will never stop. It's not thatl Once you
watch the thing yourself, only just watch.
Your attention itself is enlightened now.
With that enlightened attention, you can
just watch and stop the nonsense that
is there. But we are always conscious
that we are something great and we
have to do this and we have to do that.
There is a Chinese story about a
saint. So one king brought his cock to him
and said: "You train my cock in such a way
that he should win." He said: "Alright!" So he
kept the cock of the king for one month and
when the show started, different cocks came
from different places and they all started
fighting This cock just stood up and was
watching, just watching. And the other cocks
got such a fright. They couldn't understand
how this fellow is not disturbed, he's just
watching, he's standing, he's doing nothing.
So they all disappear from the arena and he
was declared as the successful one.
Under these circumstances what
happens is that you become another
problem. Because what can you do? You
can't do anytiing. But what you can do
is to watch.
By watching and by just seeing
things as they are, you really develop a
very different state of being.
Firstly all such people who are just
witnessing; what happen to them is very
interesting, that their memory loss is much
less, because whatever they see becomes
like a picture to them, they can tell you even
the colour, the folding, everything. Whatever
they see is so much in their mind, like a photo
So this is the best way to bring non-
violence. In violent places you go and stand
steadily there, facing all the things that are
happening and that witness state acts and
stops that kind of violence that is going on.
and they can tell you exactly what they have
But witness state is not a mental
state, it is a state of a spiritual ascent where
you become a witness. The best way to
practise witness state is not to criticise
anyone, not to criticise. I've seen people
who are all the time criticising others.
They cannot criticise themselves, so
they start criticising others, so much so
that they don't even see what's wrong
with them. They don't even see what wrong
they have done to others, because they think
they have a right to criticise others and they
enjoy this criticism very much.
seen. And your memory is not lost. While if
you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.
But people are so much habituated
with reacting. Like I know of one gentleman,
he had a habit of reacting and I was going
with him in the car. "So he was reading every
advertisement, every name of every shop,
every person, everything. He was just telling:
"Who is that? What is that?" This, that. I was
wondering: "Look at the gentleman, he's
talking so much, what will happen to him?"
But ultimately I found that all such people
who are all the time reacting become,
actually they have senile decay or maybe
Actually there's nothing to be
criticised. You just watch and see for
yourself, that's all is your right. You have no
right to criticise anyone or anything. But
some people think that if you do not
criticise, then it will go on like this and it
they become forgetful, very forgetful.
But this is not the only loss we have.
With this kind of people, when they are

formed into a collective, they can be very
dangerous people, because with that kind
of a nature, they have to do something. They
must do something because, after all, they
are combined together for a purpose or for
some reactions which all of them have build
up. In small things, in big things you'll find
people do like that. And some people who
are very much developed in this kind of
behaviour can collect lots of people and do
any amount of harm to others.
So as Sahaja yogis what should
we do? We should not react. If you see
something wrong, alright, you meditate
on that, you meditate. If you find anything
wrong happening, alright, meditate on
that. If somebody is unkind to you, at that
moment do not reacti Afterwards when that

I would take the picture of Hitler. For
nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing. He wouldn't watch
what Germans are doing, what wrong they
are doing to the society. At that time the
society also was very bad because they be able to make them understand that it is

was noting down: "These Jews are like this, have been doing. In a way, you see, the
they do this, they take money, they are
lending money", all kind of things he got into
his head. As a result of that, he built up a
reaction into him that: "We must, somehow
or another see, that these people go away
from Germany." But then he thought: "Even
if they go away from Germany, they'll
prosper again. So why not kill them?" It went
to such an extent that you cannot see such
films, you cannot see anything of that nature

followed him also did it. Without feeling any Why should you react to a woman, I can't

have something within you, if there is any
quality within you, if there is anything that can
qualify you as a great man, it will be showing.
You don't have to advertise, you don't have
to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing. So
that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a
lot. Most of the frustrations will
disappear.
mean horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get the
sympathy of others, I mean if you see the
level of your awareness, where it goes, you'll
be amazed, Like they say one lady killed her
eight children just to get sympathy from
others. But think of such horrible things
people are doing! Now if you want others to
have reactions, you do this, that they want
others to see you or to react to, I don't know,
to give you importance, you can say. But
what is the use of such an empty
importance? But people are seeking, and it
is a very common disease of modern life.
All the time how we should look, how
we should appear, how we should walk,
everything is so stupid, and a wastage of
energy. God has created human beings very
very different; none of them are copies. Even
in the nature you find the leaves of trees,
they are so unique, you cannot match them
with another leaf. So that's how human
beings are created, differently. They are
made like that. One has to accept, whatever
you are, it's alright. Why do you want to look
like another person? This kind of reaction is
extremely stupid, I think, that we are spoiling
our energy and life for something absolutely
worthless.
In Sahaja Yoga also, I have seen
people want to show off a lot. I know who
does that. But they should know, once you
do not react to outside, you start reacting to
inside and introspection will start properly.
When you see yourself, you'll be amazed
how admiring you are, how happy you are!
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don't think of all these things. You just
become thoughtless and you just stand up
as a person who is respected, whose
company is wanted, who is loved and who
is cared for.
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your
worth is great. You have come here to
emancipate human beings from these silly
ideas and foolish ways, the way people are
behaving. I don't know whom to blame...
So one should not worry as to
But suddenly our attention has
become very diversified, our reactions have
become very very funny. One does not know
why people react like that and then why do
we worry about what people react? All these
things are not only on an individual level, but
also on a collective level. As a result, you
see, new kinds of value system has been
created. Now for a mother, for example, shell
what people react, what they say about
you, what they think about you. You
should Just introspect and see for
yourself. After some time, you don't need
even introspection.
It is a kind of a state I am talking
about, where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that: "I
will not fight, so in between Me and My army,

take your army, you give us your army and
we'll strengthen our army." But arjuna said"
"I don't want army, I want you, you don't want

who are very ambitious, they want to

heads about mythical things. Once you
learn how to witness, you will know the

You'll be amazed, you will find
yourself a very very powerful person, in the
sense you'll have no ambitions, you'll have
no desires, you'll have no special fondness
or anything. But just you'll be witnessing the
drama. It's very interesting to witness also,
because then you understand the humour
behind everything, you understand the
stupidity behind everything. You understand
also how people have been so violent, and
you just laugh at it. Don't get upset,
excited, nothing, just laugh at it! After
some time, you'll be amazed, your
witness state will Increase, and when in
the collective all of you have that witness
state, you can do wonders without doing
anything, without saying anything,
without acting. Only your presence itself
can work it out. I don't say that it will have
effect on everyone, no I can't say, but
most of the people. Any person who is in

is to witness. Practise witnessing
everything: before talking, practice
witnessing; before giving any comments,
Just start witnessing. It's a very very
satisfying attitude. In Shri Krishna's life, the
greatest power He had was a witnessing
personality. Without doing anything, without
taking a sword in His hands, without talking
about fighting, He is the one who has helped
Pandavas to win the war. Not only, but
through His Gita, He has tried to tell us what
we have to do to win the war over evil. The
whole Gita is the witness state he has
described about.
If you read Gita now from this angle,
you'll be amazed to find that everywhere He
is like a witness, describing everything
whatever He sees. And He will tell you how
this witness state has helped Him to

Sthita Pragya: Sthita Pragya is the one
who is in a witness state. If you see all
these verses on Sthita Pragya, is nothing but
a person who is in a witness state, how he
lives, how he is happy, how he looks at
things. It's interesting, very interesting. First
He describes that, not like sharp people who
will describe first the bad things. But He
starts with the best, then He goes down to
other things and tells you that whatever are
the three aspects.
many things through vibrations. Gyana
doesn't mean reading books. By reading
books you become more ignorant. So Gyana
means that you must know yourself. If you
do not know yourself, you do not know
anything. So it comes to that, you must get
your self-realisation, You must know
yourself. It's the second thing He has said.
Lastly He talks about Bhakti. Bhakti
is devotion. That too is another trick of Shri
Krishna, the way He described Bhakti. Now
you find people on the street: "Hare Rama,
Hare Krishna" singing. In one word, He's
concluded, He says: "You must do Ananya
Bhakti." Ananya means when there is not
the other. That means when you have
submerged yourself into the Divine.
When you are one with the Divine, then
you should do Bhakti, otherwise I do not
accept. He says that: "If you give Me some
leaves or some fruits or some flowers, I will
accept." But for Him, the real Bhakti is only
possible when you become one with the
Divine, otherwise it's just a show.
The first He talks about KARMA
and many people get stuck at that point,
that: "Whatever karmas we are doing,
we'll get the punyas out of It." But He
didn't say that. If you know Him, then you
will know He never meant that. What he
says is that: "Whatever karmas you have
to do, you can do it, but leave the results
to the Divine Power." Results are from the
Divine Power. Now maybe that some people
think that they have got money because they
have done good karmas and start doing all
kinds of bad karmas with that money. He
didn't say that! He said: "Leave the results
to the Divine Power." Because Divine Power
knows best what is good for you. And so, if
you think you have done something good,
you have served somewhere to the poor, you
have done something really good for the
women or anything, the result of that, you
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power. It
means that you don't build up an ego for
whatever you have done. Very well, He
has written The best, but to understand Him,
one should have again the witness state, to
see what He has written about karma.
So the third Bhakti part also comes
after self-realisation. Now in the Bhakti you
see there is no --- what is the value is and
how much you've paid for it, and how you
bought it, it's not important.
For that, another great example is of
Shri Rama when He went in the jungles.
There was an old lady, from the scheduled
cast means she was one of the Bheelini, as
they call it, these people live in the jungles.
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Rama, And she said that: "I've tasted
all of them, and they are not sour, all of them
I have tasted." Now after tasting something
in India, people call it, it is not to be eaten, is
that you cannot taste something and give it
to somebody else, not that according to
Indian culture! But Shri Rama took it and
said: "What beautiful fruits! I've never eaten
Then He has written about
"Gayana". Gyana means 'where you
know.' But that doesn't mean you go on
reading books, never. Gyana means to
know what you are. That means you have
to be a Sahaja Yogi by which you know so

such fruits!" So Lakshmana got very angry,
He said: "You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that's what you are giving to
Shri Rama. Why did you do that?" Sita was
watching, so She asked: "Why don't you give
Me some of these fruits?" She gave. And
She said: "My God, what nice fruits do you
have! I've never eaten such good fruits!" So
then Lakshmana also, His temper came
down and He said: "Can You not give Me
some?" She said: "Why? You were so angry,
why should I give You?" Ultimately she gave
Him that fruit. So what did He see in those
fruits was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was
important.
food. Because he was a realised soul, to
Him, he was the best to have food with.
So your value system should be
based on such things like love. Where
you can get love you should be attached to
that person. Where you get a realised soul,
you should be attached to him. And not to
worldly people who think no end of
themselves, and think that they are great.
They may be, but, to you as Sahaja Yogis,
it's the love of people which should be
respected, should be understood and to be
felt. But if you have no witness state, then
you will see how much money this man has
got, how many cars he has got, what clothes
he's wearing. All these considerations will
be there But in a witness state, you will
understand that you will get vibrations from
this
So when you want to give something
also, it is your love which is important, not
how much you paid, what value you have
spent, nothing. It's the love with which you
do it, and that love should be evident, if such
things can happen. Even with Shri Krishna,
the same thing happened: He went to
Hastinapur, as they called it in those days,
where these Kauravas were ruling, And the
king was "Duryodhana." And he asked Him:
"You come and stay with us and have food."
He said: "No, no, I won't be able to come."
He goes to another person, Vidura, who was
the son of a maidservant, because Vidura
was a realised soul. So He went and ate in
his house, where he had cooked very simple
person, you will understand that person
is spiritual. And that's how you will stick to
such a person, you will not go for artificial
things, but a genuine personalities that are
there.
May God bless you all Thank you.
[Before Shri Mataji left the hall, She said:]
"I would say that after this Puja, I
expected all of you to keep quiet. But
everybody was talking. I don't know why,
what had happened to you. You must enjoy
the silence within yourself. I hope you'll
understand that. Thank you.

Yogis) that you should not try to copy the
western style of ego-oriented society where
people use harsh words, because then we
think that we have modernised ourselves.
They use harsh words, "What do I care"l all
these sentences, we have never used, these
are unknown to us. To anybody to say like
this is unmannerly. How can you say like that
: "I hate you!". But now I have seen people
talking like that, "What is wrong with us".
"Who are you to say that". Like that we do
not talk. This is not the way we talk. You see,
this is not the way to talk. Any person who
comes from a good family could not talk like
this because this reflects on the family. But
the language is most copied here than in the
western countries. I am surprised the way
the people talk here in buses, in taxies and
the way they use the language that's
something I can't understand. And so I have
asked them that the language be full of love
and in our traditional style.
You should not have all these ideas
of insulting people, of bringing them into
situations that they can be insulted. This is
all modern style. So we should not do like
that. In Sahaja Yoga, we should behave
in such a way that we should be dignified,
behoving out style, our tradition. Sahaja
Yoga tradition is that we talk to people
in most sophisticated manner, the
sweetest manner, in the most
affectionate manner and inviting
manner, And that is how we should all
speak.
So, this is the first thing I ask that in
your expression of love there should not
be a thing that you shout. I do shout at
people who have bhoots in them, but by
that the bhoots run away. But if you

two-three years you will have Ashrams, I am
sure. And in the Ashram, I will like to see
of my Love which you don't have, nor those
powers. So don't try these tricks with
anybody else, You have no right to shout
or get angry, because if you shout, you
get back all the bhoots in you. For they
are the ones who provoke you. They provoke
you to get caught up into it and you get
absolutely ruined, the more you try to do so.
Therefore, the best thing is to stand in
the centre and to have affection and
love, the power that I have given you.
That power you have to develop-that
power of love. First, develop that power
of love, then you don't have to worry, you
don't have to shout or do anything. Your
power will become (Krita), (active), it will

anybody ruined. But if you shout, people will
run away. Specially in aegoistical society,
you cannot shout at all, it cannot appeal to
them. If you shout in ego oriented society
this will distract them and they will run away.
This is I give to you, so I have to tell
you, that you might be highest of the highest,
first thing that you have to give me today is:
in your talk, in your behaviour in your
heart, you will put me with Love.
I am asking for two things now. It is a
funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift.
The gift you have to give is the first thing is
that you should express peacefulness
through your own character. But it does
not mean that people who are peaceful are
timid, or who are morbid people or who
tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who
are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid they fight with themselves. "How is this that

to anything, compromise with anything, but vourself then you will not progress. You
you have that sort of a temperament you
should develop and express -is very

The second thing I have to ask is that
you be peaceful. Try to have peace with
yourself. Now don't fight with yourself. Now,
the western people have one problem that

bad! I am no good!" If you go on fighting with

Once the Sahasrara is open, the heart will

life.
you understand that there is nothing wrong
with you. You have to be peaceful. You all
have to be very peaceful. You have seen,
my peaceful nature has solved so many
problems just like that. You have to achieve
that peace within you. That peace has not
to be lost at any cost, should be expressed
outside. In a way, My peace itself becomes
terrible. You don't have that kind of possibility.
Don't do it, never do it that way, try to make
your forehead relaxed. Many people come
to me with face like that (distorted, twisted
face) and I see bhoots sitting in their
forehead, then I shout at them, forehead
relaxes. "I am not doing it, Mother is doing
it". Relax. If you relax you will find that your
heart also opens out-why can't you open
your heart? Because you have no trust
in yourself. It will open your Agnya, open
your Sahasrara , and your heart will open.
On my birthday today you have to
make a promise so that you be properly
established by the end of next year, but first
two conditions should be there. If you are
not ready for that, God will never give you an
Ashram. He does not want to give Ashram
to some funny people. It becomes such that
some people have no place anywhere, come
in the Ashram. So unless and until you
have people of that calibre who remain
loving and peaceful, the Ashrams will not
be established.
You should be able to have Ashrams
in every place.

 So with discretion you must have common sense, practical sense. I've seen
people suddenly talking to anybody about Sahaja Yoga. No, that's not practical.
Sahaja Yoga is a precious diamond. You cannot give it to every person. I've seen
people at the airport raising Kundalini of everyone. No! It's not meant. They have to
come to Sahaja Yoga. They have to ask for it. They have to beg for it. Then only they can
get their realization. We don't want quantity, we want quality. All my lectures, if you
see in that I am insisting on the quality of the Sahaja Yogis, and the quality of the
seekers. But when we start thinking of getting a majority for a vote for Shri Mataji, I
have to say, I am not standing for any election. Whether you elect me or not, I am
elected. You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that and when
you fail
in discretion you find some problems develop.
