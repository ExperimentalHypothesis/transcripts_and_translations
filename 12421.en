Public Program, Hotel Krasnapolsky, Amsterdam, 16th July 1993

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot transform it, we cannot conceptualise it. Truth has to be known, through our evolutionary process, on our central nervous system. It has to be tangible. When we are seeking the truth, we have to know what we have to seek. Whatever I want to tell you today, you need not take it for granted and you should not believe me blindly. But you have to be a like scientist with an open mind and see for yourself if it is true. Then, as honest people, you have to accept it because it is for the benevolence of yourself, your country and the whole world at large.

These days we see so many problems in our life all kinds of struggles going on. On one side you see our family life is breaking; our society is breaking; people are becoming materialistic and have no place for love and affection. Everybody seems to be starving for affection and compassion. These are the worst times for peace also. There is no big war on but every country seems to be on the war path with each other. People take to all destructive measures automatically. As a result we have people who are suffering from all kinds of diseases which are incurable. There are people who are taking to drugs and heavy things which are just to destroy themselves. In the most affluent countries of Scandinavia and Switzerland, the young people are trying to compete in suicide. So this so called affluence has not helped us. There is something missing in us that we cannot come to a common point.

All these problems come to us because we do not know the absolute truth. We are following some sort of blind faith or some sort of a dogma or some sort of an artificial theory. And we believe through our rationality that whatever we are doing is good. It has not helped anyone. If you go to science, you’ll find out that science is amoral. It deals with matter, but what about the living process? So I have to tell you what the truth is.

The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, but you are pure spirit. And the second truth is that there is an all pervading power of divine love that does all the living work. Now you see all these beautiful flowers all over, especially Holland is known for its flowers, but it’s a miracle that out of one seed a particular type of flower comes up. But we take it for granted; we don’t even think how it works. We take everything for granted; our heart is running, how? What is the remote control for this heart of so many people? The doctors say it’s the autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto?

So we turn to religion and many religions there are, but we have found that religions are only power oriented or money oriented. They are not spirit oriented. Thus we get lost there also. And out of these beautiful flowers of these great incarnations and prophets what has come out are these beautiful religions. They were born on the same tree of spirituality. They preached, of course, according to the time but people plucked these flowers and are now fighting with the dead flowers, this is mine, this is mine. Thus we have fundamentalism and all kinds of problems arising out of ignorance.

All these problems come to us from human beings. And all these problems in human beings come to us through these centres which are in our subtle system. When this subtle system is out of gear, we get physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems. Now by any chance, if you could put these centres right and we could be one with this all pervading power of divine love, then all problems can be solved. Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains, it has no identity, it has no meaning.

When you are not connected... that is the yoga, it’s the union. Sahaja means born with you, “saha” means with, “ja” means born. It is born with you the right to become one, “yoga”, with this all pervading power. This is the resurrection. This is the last judgement. This is the last breakthrough of our evolution which we have to achieve. It’s a living process of evolution. Our creator was the greatest planner. He has made beautiful instruments within us to achieve this last breakthrough of our second birth and when it happens, you can feel on your finger tips this all pervading power for the first time.

The first thing that happens to you is that you live in your present. We live in the past, which doesn’t exist now anymore, which is finished or in the future which also doesn’t exist. The reality is in the present. But we cannot stay in our present. A thought rises, falls off, another thought rises, falls off and we are jumping on the cusp of the past and the future thoughts. But when this power, which is in the sacrum bone, rises, awakens, both these thoughts separate and in between these thoughts there is, what you call, the present. There you do not think but you are absolutely aware. If you want you can think; if you don’t want you need not think. You can stop your thinking completely. And spirituality grows in the present. As a result you develop a new dimension in your awareness which we call thoughtless awareness.

Then you start feeling this all pervading power on your finger tips. It enlightens all these five, six and seven (centres) on both the hands, fourteen points. And on these fourteen points, you can decode what they are saying. So you can feel your own centres, what’s wrong with you. So there is self-knowledge. Also you can feel the centres of others. So you develop a new dimension in your awareness called collective consciousness. You can feel it on your finger tips, of anybody, far away or dead. But if you know how to correct these centres, sitting down here, then you can solve the problem. All these powers are within you. Now the spirit is the source of absolute truth. Spirit is the reflection of God almighty in your heart. So in all of us, when it is reflected, it is the collective being.

Now you can ask any question after realisation, for example, you can ask the question; “Is there God?” And you start getting absolutely a cool breeze of the divine power on your finger tips. Now there are many people who are false, who talk about God and have nothing to do with it. They just want to make money out of you. So you ask the question “Are they divine people, do they have anything to do with God or not?” You’ll immediately feel, especially this here, a kind of pins and needles, maybe a little burning. From an individual to anything you can ask the question. You all will get the same answer.

Because we are not standing in reality there are fights and quarrels and nobody thinks the same way as the other thinks. There are arguments, discussion; all kinds of things but without any results. But then you don’t quarrel, don’t fight, nothing. You know the truth; all of you know the same truth. In the present you have peace within yourself. You become peaceful in the present state. That peace is also within yourself.

I have met people who have got, you see, great awards for peace and big, big money, just as calling them symbols of peace, I have met them. But they have no peace within. Actually they are extremely hot tempered people. So you can find out what is real and what is unreal. And also you get the power to be one with reality because of absolute knowledge. Supposing I’m holding a snake in my hand and I’m ignorant, and you tell me there is a snake in your hand and I am very adamant, I’ll say “No, it’s not a snake. It’s a rope”, I’ll go on saying;”This is a rope.” Till the snake bites me, I’ll go on saying “No, no, this is a rope.” But if there is a little light, I’ll just throw away the snake. So you don’t have to be told “Don’t do this, don’t do this”, you just don’t do it, whatever is destructive. It happens automatically.

Also when your attention is enlightened by your spirit, it becomes innocent. We should know that our innocence cannot be lost, cannot be destroyed; it is all there, intact. Only we can say there are some clouds. But as soon as this light comes into us, our eyes become innocent, our temperament becomes innocent. And a person of such a calibre, even paying attention to anyone, can do a lot.

As I told you that these centres are responsible for your physical, emotional and spiritual being, so believe me that your physical problems are cured. You’ll be amazed to know that many incurable diseases are cured by Sahaja Yoga. A lot of research has been done in India, as well as in England. Also there is nice book that has come out now by a doctor who was the head of a department. But if you get your realisation, after that you don’t suffer from any physical trouble. May be there is some dormant sickness but it can be cured. Many mental cases have also been cured with Sahaja Yoga because you are connected with that vital force which nourishes you completely and your centres are absolutely integrated.

In short you become a saint; but you don’t have to give up your families, you don’t have to sacrifice and suffer. You have done all this nonsense in your last life. How can you suffer when your father God Almighty is nothing but compassion? Which father would like his son to suffer? Christ has already suffered for us. Are we going to suffer more than him? But I think this theory is there because people want to frighten you and make you suffer. I can’t understand.

So actually this is the time for you to enter into the Kingdom of God where there is joy, an ocean of joy. Joy is not happiness and unhappiness; it is absolutely singular; absolute joy. We have not known ourselves at all and our brain is only active like the tip of an iceberg. Actually people become extremely dynamic and extremely compassionate. There are many artists who suddenly have become world famous after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

Now also I was surprised that in Paris, I discovered that there are many Muslims, who do not want to be fundamentalist, who have joined Sahaja Yoga. Because they say whatever I am saying is also in the Koran; and also in the Bible, that you are to be born again. But we give ourselves a certificate: “I’m born again. I’m Christian. I’m Muslim. I’m Hindu.” This is all a brand. It has not helped anyone so far. Unless and until you are connected to God, how can you even pray to him? It’s very misleading, and no wonder people are now giving up the idea of God. But there is God Almighty. Everything is tangible in Sahaja Yoga. It’s not a blind faith.

The most surprising thing is that in countries where there was communism once upon a time, Sahaja Yoga is spreading like fire. They had no conditionings, and though their government was no good, people were very introspective. I’m in no way for communism, but what is democracy? It’s a “demonocracy”. There was no proper communism, there is no proper democracy. If you are going to America, you can’t even wear your wedding ring. They may kill you, even for your wedding ring; where it is supposed to be the height, or the greatest type of democracy; and tremendous slavery of a very subtle nature.

Like a fashion starts in Paris for six-inch skirts (mini-skirts), so all over Europe and America you can’t find any sensible skirts. We talk of individuality, but there is nothing; they are like herds, everybody is wearing the same dress. Now some clownish dress starts, everybody wants to wear the same clownish dress. Where is the individuality? There is such a slavery of materialism; all kinds of stupidity also. That they could not do in communist countries. Like this actress Elisabeth Taylor marrying nine times or eight times, I have lost count; and grown-up people going to see her honeymoon; four thousand people waiting in front of her house and ten helicopters hovering over; and the parachutes coming down taking photographs - and they fell on the trees and on the people!

I’m sure the Dutch would never accept such a thing. It’s so stupid. Also I saw a film where eighty-year, ninety-year-old actors and actress, dressed up in very dazzling dresses, were going for a shake dance; very seriously. And while getting down from the car only, they were shaking. What was the need for them to go for a shake dance? Such stupid things they do.

In America I was really shocked because the problems they brought to me were so stupid. I said have they lost all their wisdom? They have no maturity of any kind. Because there is freedom, freedom to the media, they can publish anything and people take it without even thinking. They are ashamed to be mature. They do such stupid things, unbelievably absolutely subhuman. So what is our development? In America they have birthdays of dogs and celebrate it in a big way. This stupidity, idiocy that has come through our freedom, we should really be a little careful. And they feel they have no identity. In a free country why should people think they have no identity? So they start all kinds of fads.

Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots and stupid people. Only such people can be exploited by some false gurus or something. I mean in Boston they asked me “How many Roll Royces do you have?” - the media. I said,”I have none. I have only one car that my husband has.” So they said, “We are not interested. You are not in the business”.

The greatest joke is like this. There is a place called Togliatti in Russia where we have twenty two thousand practicing Sahaja Yogis, twenty two thousand. And I went there only recently after Gorbatchov declared the freedom, and I have been going to America for years. So we had a meeting in Togliatti and one gentleman asked an American; “How many Sahaja Yogis you have?” So he said “In America we have fifty-six.” So the Togliatti fellow says “O my God, you are fifty-six thousand, we are only twenty-two thousand!” So the America which is the epitome of development, this is the growth of their brains.

Now we have to stop and think where we are going? What is our future? What have we to achieve? It’s all within you. It’s your own power. It’s all given to you. Your evolution is freely for you. You cannot pay for it. No effort is needed. No suffering, no mantras, nothing. You are awakened as easily as you put the seed in the mother earth and she sprouts. Because the seed has the built-in quality and the mother earth also has the built-in quality to sprout. So it is for you to know the value of your life. Not to waste it clinging on to this organisation, that organisation; no!

Try to understand what you can achieve yourself. You have all the divine powers within you. You can give realisation to people, you can cure them, you can give them peace; you can give them joy. It’s all your own. The fragrance is within you which has to manifest. But we have to have respect for ourselves and concern about yourself. But if you are conditioned and don’t want to open your heart, it’s going to be difficult because this power of Kundalini, which is in the sacrum bone, is the power of pure desire. This bone is called sacrum, means the Greeks knew it’s a sacred bone.

I know you all have some questions in your heads and now I have become quite clever, I can answer all your questions. But it’s mental acrobatics. You have to go beyond the mental. So it’s no use answering questions. See in this hall, there are so many lights, and you just have to put on one switch and all the lights are there, because they are built-in. But supposing I have to tell you all the history of electricity, then how it was brought to Holland, then to this hall, you’ll be all bored stiff. So why not get your enlightenment? Because it is built-in within you. Tonight, I am sure, you all are going to get your self -realisation. But if you are still attached to some organisation or you are attached to some sort of idiocy, then it may not work. But if you are desirous of getting your self-realisation, you will get it.

So may God bless you.

It will take about - because we are also slaves of this watch - ten to fifteen minutes or so. So many slaveries, you see. So if you don’t want to have your self-realisation, I would humbly request that you can go because it is not civil to disturb others.

At the very outset, I have to assure you that if you want your self-realisation, all of you will get it tonight. You must have full confidence.

The first thing, or we can say, the first request I have is this, that you should not feel guilty about anything whatsoever. If you have committed mistakes, you should face them that’s all, but what’s the use of feeling guilty. I must tell you that when you feel guilty, this centre here on the left side gets out of gear completely. And as a result, you get a horrible disease called angina, or you get spondalitis, or else you might get lethargic organs. Also it’s a fashion to feel guilty. Like in Switzerland one lady told me “I’m feeling very guilty for Afghanistan”. But what have you done? I mean, you have nothing to do with Afghanistan. People even feel guilty if they put the knife and fork in the wrong way. Can you imagine? All stupid types of norms that human beings have found; we start feeling guilty. All this matter, all this world is for your enjoyment, you are the masters. But if you feel guilty and this centre is catching, which I know is very much catching here, then this Kundalini won’t rise, she’ll stop here. So just tell yourself “I am not guilty at all”, tell yourself absolutely you have done nothing wrong. After all you are not God, you are human beings and human beings have to commit mistakes. So why feel guilty, I can’t understand.

So the second request is that you have to forgive everyone without even thinking about them. Logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. But this centre inside the brain is like this with the optic chiasm and unless and until you forgive it won’t open. So there’s another hurdle. But you have already tortured yourself quite a lot for others, now why do you want to miss this point? Many say “We can’t forgive”. Just say it. When I tell you; in general, don’t even think of them, it’s a headache.

The third condition, or request, I would say, is that you have to be absolutely confident about yourself. Whatever you have done, whatever so called mistakes you have committed. This all pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. So be absolutely confident that you will get your realisation. Otherwise you would not have come here. I hope you will comply with these three requests of mine and achieve your self-realisation.

Now this is how it sprouts but you have to look after the growth of your spirituality. Sahaja Yoga is a living process of a living organism. The microcosm becomes the macrocosm. So you cannot just say I am doing it at home or I am doing individually. You have to come to our collective. Also you have to know that our door is open to everyone, it is free; so all kind of crazy people also might come in. You should not worry about them. These crazy people also get alright. So you must have patience with them and compassion for them. It’s a collective happening, like if a nail is cut out, it doesn’t grow, so you have to belong to the body which is a living organism.

This is how you transcend all races and fundamentalism and all kinds of nonsense, because God has created one world. And all the wars and strifes can end up. It is a very silent revolution and at this important time, you should join hands with us. We’ll have our follow on; please all of you after realisation come to it. You won’t have to pay at all. But you have to give some time to yourself and respect yourself. In the West my experience has been horrifying. For my program there will be five thousand people and for the follow up hardly three or four. While I must say in communist countries, there will be two thousand in the hall, two thousand outside. And if you say that we will have the program outside, there will be six thousand the next morning. And all the six thousand will get to it. It’s very surprising; those who have never known about God are taking to reality. And gradually these countries might become very powerful, even financially. So let us be serious about it.

First we’ll show you how to nourish your own centres. Keep your eyes open and see for yourself; and then we’ll close our eyes and your ascent will take place. So now you have to be very comfortably sitting in your chairs. We don’t have to go to the Himalayas and stand on our heads. In your chair you get your realisation. So first of all place your left hand on your lap very comfortably. Everybody must do it; left hand. Open it out. Please put the left hand; your left hand; not right. Tell him the left. She is alright. He is... the gentleman. Put your left. It’s correct. They speak Hindi language? Now put your left hand. Now this left hand is symbolic because the left side is the power of desire, mundane desire. So it’s symbolic that you desire your self-realisation. Now the right side is the power of action. So we use the right hand for nourishing our centres, only on the left-hand side. But we have to understand that whatever we are doing is only for tonight. I’m sorry to say but it is better you take out your shoes because this mother earth also helps us a lot. There are people who don’t even want to take out...they left because of the shoes, I am surprised. It doesn’t matter. So... a very small sacrifice is to take out your shoes, isn’t it? Alright, now please put both your legs apart from each other. That means there are two powers.

Now you have to put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit, I have told you. If you become the spirit, you become your own master, your own guide. There is a centre for your mastery which is created by the great masters; masters and prophets. Please put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. I respect your freedom and I cannot force divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. You’ll be amazed to know that the centre for pure knowledge is at the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Again raise your hand, right hand, on to the upper portion of your abdomen. Then raise it on your heart. Then raise it in the angle of your neck and shoulder and put your head to the right. I’ve already told you about this centre. Now raise your right hand on your forehead across and please put down your head. This is the centre for forgiving everyone in general. Now please put your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. At this centre without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power. Now stretch your palm fully. This is the last centre. Please put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now the most important thing is to push back your fingers, so there is a pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head again, fully. Now move your hand, with a pressure on your scalp, seven times clockwise, slowly. That’s all we have to do.

There is a gentleman sitting there, he is not doing anything, he should leave the hall. I would be thankful. Please leave the hall, that’s very kind of you if you can leave the hall. What is he saying? He is not leaving? Why? (Henno: He is arguing). We can argue later on, just now they want to have their realisation. You are the only person, will you please go out. Yes, we’ll argue later on. Thank you. By argument what can you get? Nothing!

(Self realisation)

So now we put our feet apart from each other like this. Take down your hands, take down. Put the left hand like this, on the left-hand side. You can take off your spectacles because you have to close your eyes and you need not open your eyes till I tell you.

So please put your right hand on your heart and now close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself to me. You can call me Shri Mataji, or Mother, whatever you like. So the first question you have to ask three times: “Mother, am I the spirit? I’ve told you if you are the spirit, you become your own master. (Something missing? – tape goes quiet)

Now put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it. Please ask another fundamental question here three times; “Mother, am I my own master?”

I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So please put your right hand on the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard and ask six times, because this centre has got six petals; please say six times; “Mother, please give me pure knowledge.” As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the upper centres with our self confidence.

So now raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen. And here you have to say with full confidence, ten times: ”Mother, I am my own master.”

I’ve already told you that the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this conditioning but you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on top of your heart and here you have to say again with full confidence, twelve times: “Mother, I am the pure spirit.”

This divine power is the ocean of knowledge, love and joy. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you have committed are easily dissolved into this ocean of forgiveness. So now please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder, and turn your head to the right. Here you have to say it with full confidence sixteen times: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

I have explained to you already that logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands. So raise your hand onto your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say, from your heart, not how many times: “Mother, I forgive everyone in general.” Don’t think about them. This is very important.

Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without thinking about your mistakes, counting, or your guilt, just for your satisfaction, you have to say; ”Oh, divine power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

In Sahaja Yoga, you get the actualisation of your baptism and the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost reflected as the Kundalini which is actually the primordial mother. Now please stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. And now bend your head. Please stretch back your fingers; please stretch them back so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Here again I respect your freedom. I cannot force self-realisation on you. So you have to ask for it and so please say seven times, moving your scalp seven times: “Mother, please give me my self-realisation.” Please bend your heads forward. (Shri Mataji blows in the microphone seven times).

Now please take down your hands and open your eyes. Put both your hands like this towards me and don’t think. Watch me and don’t move, just keep it steady. Now put the right hand like this and bend your head and see for yourself with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Some people get it close by, some far away, but don’t keep your hand on the head. Now please take your left hand like this and put down your head again and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. You have to move a little, see for yourself. Bend your head, bend your head it’s easier. Now once again, put the right hand towards me and put down your head again and see for yourself now if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head and ask me one of the three questions which I’ll tell you now. Please ask three times: “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” or ”Mother, is this the all pervading power of divine love?” or ”Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya”. Ask any one of these three times.

Now please take down your hands. You’ll feel relaxed, and all those who have felt a cool or a hot breeze on their fingers or in their hands or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

Wah, wah, the whole of Holland is now flowering. It’s the blossom time! This is the first time you have felt it. (applause). This is the first time you have felt the cool breeze of the all pervading power which is called also as “Ruh”. So now you have to grow more and I hope you’ll definitely come to the follow on and in the collective. If you have any problems or questions, you should write to me, later on.

May God bless you.

Now enjoy yourself. Should we have some music? (Applause) They want to sing one song to you.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
