How I came into Sahaja Yoga was, when I was at university, you thought there's more to life than meets the eye. My first venture into finding out about that was I went along to TM, and that introduced me to something, but of course, you suddenly realize that there were no answers there. They talked about realization being something that was at the end of a long path that you may eventually get to.

Then I came across an old Time Out magazine where it said that Shri Mataji gave realization. I thought, "Well, this is something I've got to go to," because I don't have to wait, you see. But there was no telephone number or anything like that, so I had to wait until I went to the Mind, Body & Spirit Festival. I went around this thing, past all the pyramid power and all those sort of weird and wonderful things, and came out with a big, big headache. I was lucky I picked up a leaflet outside, and that was for Shri Mataji's program.

So I went from there to this program. Shri Mataji was giving a program in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and Mia was there. I got my realization there, and that answered all my questions, really.

So Mia, what was the program like?

I can't remember. I remember taking him out and showing him how to do a certain technique.

She beat him.

I remember that, but it was a long time ago, so my memory...

I came in March 1978. A friend of mine, Charlie, who was also Sikh and had been to India, been everywhere, said, "I went to Caxton Hall." He said, "This lady showed me a small black-and-white photograph, and it's got these vibrations." And she said, "You might be able someday to go to Finchley to meet her." I said, "Yeah, I'm coming!" I hadn't been to any gurus as such, but I read lots of books about India, about meditation, and I was into vegetarianism and Hatha Yoga and all sorts.

So we went there. We walked into the room, and it was maybe a bit smaller than this, and there were about fifteen people in there. They all had a red mark on their foreheads; it was after Easter Puja. We didn't know what it was, but it didn't upset me. I quite liked it, actually. I thought it was something new.

And Shri Mataji... I thought, "I know her. I've seen her before somewhere." She was very familiar to me. So I sat in front of her, and they were working on me. I said it was cool, but I didn't feel anything, really.

But when I went home—I was living in Maida Vale, just on the edge of Regent's Park—I had a shower. I was alone in the flat I was sharing with some people, but they were away. Straight away, I couldn't think at all. I tried to think, and I couldn't. I used to do Hatha Yoga, so I knew I had to lie down. I lay down on the floor, and I was aware of energy coming to my void, but it went to the heart and went everywhere. It went like a crown on my head, and I was really in bliss.

I realized this is something special because I met this lady today. I realized she's something really special. That's how I came to Sahaja Yoga.

So it wasn't a cave, then?
