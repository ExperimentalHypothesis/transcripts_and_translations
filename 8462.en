Public program, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, London (England), May 7th, 1979

[Unclear.] Music is a very great instrument for the Spirit to manifest itself. Especially Vina is one of the Adivaadyas, they call them, or you can say the musical instrument, which is a very important instrument for inciting the Kundalini also. As he is a Realised soul, it will definitely act on people whenever he will play. I am sure it is going to give him a great success. May not be to many people it will appeal, but it will definitely go to people who are seeking and who are deep within themselves, asking for the answers of many absolute questions.

The seeking is a fashion today, in the West, and also it is very genuine among many. What are we seeking in life? What do we expect to seek? One thing we know that we are not satisfied with whatever things we have. We are not satisfied with our material being, neither with our emotional being, neither with our mental being. Always the joy is followed by unhappiness. That means that there is something imperfect within us, something lacking very much. If that was not so, we would have been happy like the birds, like the flowers, like the animals. This lacking is felt only in this form which we call as a human being. Only in the human being, one feels that there is something that is missing in life. Because in the evolutionary path, as you know, human beings are the highest and they have reached a stage where they are aware of this lacking, this imperfection within ourselves.

This is I think also is the blessing of the modern times that we are aware of it much more today than we were ever. Some are really aware of it, they are genuinely aware of it, and they are really seeking something. Others take to fashion, they may not be that deep, they may not be that massive, but if I have to tell you that there is a life which is not known to us which is beyond us, it is not easy for a thinking man to believe in it because we see only our body, we can see the working of our minds but we cannot see other things, we cannot feel them through our senses, and it is very difficult for a modern person to believe into something that is beyond.

But this is not only one dimension, that we have another life, another force, another source but I would say there are at least 4 dimensions in which we live unknown to those realms which are around us. Sometimes we get a glimpse of that sometimes, but we are not stationed there, neither we are there to understand it.

Here are we have shown in the diagram a human being. I hope you all can see. Can you? You all can come this way. There is no need to be in that way, could all be this way it’s better, because the new people will come, they can go there. It’s better together. Here, that’s better. Now can you all see from there. Can you all sit down; can you see from there? Oh, you can come round. Here is the human being, as you are a human being.

Now whatever I have to tell you about this you need not believe me at all. There is no blind faith needed on the contrary blind faith goes against reality, but keep yourself open and see for yourself if it works. You need not have any preconceived ideas about it also, because you will be able to see later on that whatever I say can happen to you all.

Now this is a human being as I have shown here, and he has got the left, right, and the lower and the top of his head, 4 sides.

The left side of the human being contains all the subconscious, all that is dead in him in all his lives, and through his left side he is connected to the collective consciousness, collective subconsciousness that is all that is dead. All that has happened all that is (bhawa-?).

On the right-hand side there is another area which is called as the supraconscious. Left-hand side is all the past, right-hand side is all the future about which we conceive of, about which we think of. By our mental activity we can conceive of all the future we can achieve. For example, the idea of going to the moon existed in this part. We have achieved it by movement towards the right and also all that is dead in the name of future. Like a person who always plans about the future is also on the right-hand side, in the collective supraconscious. The right-hand area is the [individual] supraconscious and beyond that is the collective supraconscious. This area is also unknown to us. Left-hand side area is also unknown to us. But whatever is unknown need not be divine and need not be a conveyance for your Realisation.

As you see, down below is the area where what we call the Hell, exists. It exists around us. But on top of the head there exists an area of Super-consciousness that is the area of divine Power. You have heard in the books that there is All-pervading divine Power, the Holy Ghost, the Adi Shakti, which encompasses the whole universe. The whole creation even the small atoms and molecules, it is pulsating because of this all-pervading power of Divine Power.

In all the scriptures, it has been described but how are we to believe it. Is there really such a power existing? Is there something beyond or it is only the material life that we live into, that we are every day? Today we are worried about what to get for food what to wear, how to go about social life, political life, economic life. Or is there any other power which is really manifesting, acting, controlling, co-ordinating and also all the time loving you. If there is so has anybody felt it, has anybody known it? This is the power you are really seeking, not the power of the left hand or the right hand nor the power of hell which is a bottomless pit. You are seeking the power that is all pervading is the power of God’s love. Love is the most powerful thing. But which love? Is the dynamic love of God.

"Is there God even?" One can ask a question like that. "Is there God? Are we to believe that there is God? How are we to believe that there is God?" People have believed into God without knowing him, without feeling him, without any experience. Why they have been doing it? Because there has been a sustaining force. Some sort of a sustaining force has been working on them, which has kept them alive, the fact that there is some power who we can call as Divine Power.

But nobody has so far been able to give an en masse understanding or feeling of it. Very few who talked about it, who felt it, were never accepted by common people. They were rejected, stoned, crucified, killed, poisoned. It is said that the whole world, the whole universe that you see is just a reflection on the mirror of that all-pervading power. When you see the reflection, you cannot see the mirror. You have to become the mirror but how? Then we come to one question, why did a human being become a human being from amoeba stage, why did he become that?

What is the purpose of making him a human being of this shape? We should wonder about it, why with two limbs like that, two legs like that in an erect position? It is a fundamental question which any scientist should look into. What is the reason for creating in all these thousands of years a human being? It is not just to run a puppet show of politics or economics, it has no meaning, it is just a game going on. You can see it clearly, it’s a game. Is it only to play these games we were made into human beings..

If so, why are we not happy about it, why are we not satisfied, why do we not feel our fulfilment? The reason is our fulfilment is not this, is something very different. Unless and until we have that fulfilment, we are not going to feel satisfied with ourselves, and that fulfilment is to feel that Super-consciousness which is all-pervading. So, we can also conclude that if we have to become that, if we have to become that all pervading power or if we have to be connected to that all pervading power, what are we going to gain out of it?

First of all, you do not know any truths, you do not know if there is God, it is all relative. If there is God there is 37 truths, people say, there are 38 truths, there are 65 truths, is there any absolute truth? A simple question like God, is there God, is a fundamental question. If you ask this question to a computer, you might get any number of answers as many numbers of computers there are. Those people who are feeding the computers will give you a different answer. But if there is something else by which we can know the absolute?

We have become a human being without doing anything about it. We were just amoeba anyway and we have become a Human Being, we have done nothing about it. What are we going to do to become that by which you are going to know this Super consciousness within you? You cannot do anything about it. It is a spontaneous process it is a living process within you which works spontaneously. And that’s why we call it Sahaja. ‘Saha’ means ‘with’, ‘ja’ means ‘born’, it is born with you. What is born with you is the light to unite with that power. It is born with you, so we call it as Sahaja Yoga. It is the Maha Yoga they call it because this is what one has to achieve.

All the rest of the nonsensical things are useless. Supposing you start flying on a flying saucer what’s the use? Supposing somebody gives you 100 diamonds, what’s the use? Supposing you get into a trance and start talking big what’s the use? Supposing by saying some mantras you become a speedy person and you start doing too much of work and cannot rest like a mad possessed person, what’s the use?

So, what do you have to become is your Self, which you are not yet your Self. Because you do not know your Self, you do not know what is within you. You cannot feel your Self. Because you cannot feel your Self, we can say that there is no awareness about your Self. At the most you can see some pain here or a pain there. Because you cannot feel your Self, you cannot feel others.

Now what is the mechanism that God has built within us? How are we built? We have to find out. In our being God resides as a reflection in our heart as Spirit, as Atma. How are we to know there is Atma is a simple thing.Like I would say I am not this church, I am not this life because I can see I am not this lamp, because I can see I am not this mind because I know how it works. I am not this body because I can see there is something else that is seeing it. You go on negating one by one; you reach a place where there is one “I” which knows what is that “I”. You have to reach that point.

From the point of science, we have to know there are many things absolutely undiscovered so far. If there are doctors here, they will know we have a system called as autonomous nervous system. Yes, it works on itself. What is this auto? In Sanskrit, we can call it 'Swayamchaalit' [unsure]. What is this 'Swayam', what is this self-driven, self-motivated system? You have just given it a name; you have not explained anything by saying it is autonomous. But who is this auto, who is this Atma, who does this work? If you can understand that there is something which knows everything about us and around us that is the one, is the Spirit.

You say that all the time, “I know.” Now which part of you knows? But how to know the Self? Is there any mechanism within us that God has placed to know the Self by which we know this All-pervading Power of Super-consciousness? There is a beautiful mechanism within us placed and that mechanism is called in the Sanskrit language as Kundalini because in India people have meditated. They were not so much challenged by the nature as they are challenged in other countries. It is a very warm country; people can live with minimum. It was not necessary for them to indulge so much in the protection of their body, securing food or ordinary life.

They could live so their attention was turned towards the questions that I just now said that, “Why are we here as Human Beings.” And when they started searching it in their meditation, they discovered the great truth about this great instrument called as Kundalini. Of course, in the Bible also there is a mention of Kundalini, because it is said that, “I will appear before you like tongues of flames.” Tongues of flames, how do we explain tongues of flames? Where are the tongues of flames within us? Have you seen any tongues of flames within us? Have you seen them outside somewhere, that God is going to appear before us as tongues of flames? That is a description of the Kundalini, of the chakras, of the centres which lies within us in this way as it is shown over here.

You may say you are not seeing it. Alright, for that you have to have a different personality, a higher personality where you become that all-pervading power, when you get in contact with that Divine Power. Then only you start feeling those centres within you on your fingers. You can feel them very clearly, you can feel all these centres that are within you and also the centres in other people.

Now there are at least 50% people who have felt it among you. Minimum of 50% people who know about it and at least there are 25% who have mastered this. So why not the rest of them, all of them should get it. But for that keep a little open mind and I will explain to you what is the Kundalini within us. I am talking of the subtler things, much subtler than we think of. Can you say from where does our idea of innocence come? Do we ever realise that there is definitely this idea prevalent? We accept the word ‘innocence’. It is a very subtle thing innocence is. From where does it come to us innocence, where does it lie within us? Can any psychologist tell me from where does the innocence come and how it is destroyed and how you can regain it back?

All these centres here, these 7 centres that lie within us, represent such subtle things like innocence, the first centre which lies below the Kundalini, the Kundalini which is the main force, residual force which brings forth this experience of Self Realisation, the one that connects you with the mains, like you can say this is connected with the mains. Unless and until it is connected, what we talk of God, what we talk of the all-pervading power, it all has no meaning. It is just a joke going on. If it is not connected, if I speak on this, will you hear me?

In the same way, when you are not connected with God through your Self-realisation, all talk of God could be all right or could be horrid. You may be worshipping a devil in the name of God. How will you know that a person is divine?

This Kundalini which is above the first centre which is in three and a half coils, is an energy that rests in the triangular bone in every Human Being in a dormant stage just waiting for that moment when somebody who is authorised can raise it and give you that power. This is, I am talking about your own power, and not my power, it is your own power which must manifest.

If you go to a guru if he just polishes off your money, what do you understand of it? He is just befooling you. If he cannot give you your own power then he is not a Guru. It is your own power which must manifest and you should feel this all-pervading power. You must experience it, you must experiment it and should be able to manoeuvre it. Then only one can say you are self-realised. Not only that but you should be able to feel your own chakras and you should be able to feel the chakras of others, and you should be able to give Realisation to others. All this can be done once you are Self-realised. Without that nothing can work out. My talk is a talk, it has no meaning unless and until it has worked out the miracle of Kundalini awakening.

Now, a lot has been said against the Kundalini awakening part. People are frightened. There are books and books which fill people with awe to read about Kundalini, saying what, “Whatever it is it is a dangerous path of Kundalini, why going here to Kundalini? It is going to torture us” and all that.

I can assure you that in India, abroad, and everywhere, thousands of people must have come to Sahaja Yoga, not a single person has suffered. On the contrary at least out of them 70% people have achieved Self-realisation. Because she is your Mother. She is your Divine Mother. If your Mother has so much of compassion for you, love for you, she is the source of all that love and she is not going to trouble you. On the contrary she is so kind. She is just waiting for the moment for it to happen. She is not going to trouble you and torture you.

Then how is it these people have felt such horrible experiences you may ask me. They are not authorised people, they do not know how to do it, they have no authority to awaken the Kundalini. Supposing you do not know how to handle a mechanism, electrical mechanism, when you put your hand into it you will burn your hand. Does that mean that electricity gives you burning?

If you are not a person who is entitled to do a thing! Such a person has to be definitely a holy person. If he is not a holy person, he has no business to raise the Kundalini. A person who leads a very sinful life has nothing to do with Kundalini. One must know that a cynic can never take you to God. But a person who is holy and the one who is Realised can definitely raise your Kundalini. And the Kundalini only will rise because of him and not because of any ordering or any manoeuvring or any doing about it. All these things are absolutely useless because Kundalini is the consciousness which understands, which thinks, which loves and it obeys only the one who has the power to love as much as she does.

All these big, big books I have read I was amazed how these people without any knowledge about Kundalini, without any understanding about it, have written these big books just to make some money. Have they not to answer to God for what they have done?

So, have no fear about Kundalini, she is your Mother, the kindest of all, full of love, and she forgives you all that you have done. She is the storehouse of all the compassion that you could think of and she is not going to burn you or trouble you or give you any trouble. But if you have a problem, she will attend to it. For example, if someone is suffering from liver trouble you can see with your naked eye the Kundalini pulsating coming to the liver and supplying it.

Here there are, as I have told you, 50% people who have seen the pulsation of the Kundalini at the triangular bone, and there are thousands who have seen it with naked eye. You can see it pulsating in the triangular bone. Some of these people who have written such big books on the Kundalini have said that the Kundalini resides in the stomach. I mean something so absurd they have written, something so wrong, so false and that is why you don’t be afraid of this word ‘Kundalini’.

This Kundalini is the one kept in a sleeping condition they say for this last culmination of your evolution as a human being to become connected with that subtle force. And this Kundalini when it rises and passes through the various chakras, it enlightens them one by one. All these chakras are placed within us during the different evolutionary periods.

The first one which is the Ganesha Chakra as they call it, is the Mooladhara Chakra, is the centre of Mooladhara. But is not the Mooladhara or the Kula Kunda as they call it, is Mooladhara Chakra, is the one that sustains the Mooladhara. Now what is the word meaning ‘Mooladhara’, means ‘the support of the root’. What is the support of the root? The support of the root is the ground, is the earth, is the matter, and that’s why this represents the matter within us. Matter is innocent, matter has got innocence and you get your innocence from this chakra.

Shri Ganesha was made out of the – they say, it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it – out of the mud that was covering the Mother Parvati or you can say the Gauri at that time, because she was not married in the sense that she was a virgin, just finished her marriage, and she was to meet her husband. And this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting her husband, so she cleanses her hands properly and makes this deity of Shri Ganesha which is bestowed on this centre. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation, you can see Shri Ganesha settled down there very clearly.

Shri Ganesha is the embodiment of innocence and that’s why he is a child, that’s why his head is that of an elephant, because an elephant being an animal doesn’t grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That’s why he is a child. He is the embodiment of childhood and he incarnated on this earth once which is described in Devi Bhagavatam, if you read, as Mahavishnu. He has incarnated as Mahavishnu and this was nobody else but Lord Jesus Christ. Even he was born in a way, the same way as Ganesha was born without the father, to a virgin. If I am saying something untrue you can find out later by verifying it through a method which I will explain to you a little later.

This is a very, very important centre for all of us, because unless and until the deity settled on this chakra permits, the Kundalini will not rise. If your innocence is in danger the Kundalini will never rise and even if it rises for a little while out of its excitement, it will again be sucked back. Though this chakra is placed below the Kundalini which is a very important point which people do not know. It is below the Kundalini and not above the Kundalini. So, it is not necessary to pierce this chakra through the Kundalini, it is not necessary. What is necessary is to know the importance of this centre and allow the Kundalini to rise and it passes through other 6 chakras and that is why is called as Sat Chakra Bheda, that means there are 6 chakras which it crosses.

Now the lower chakra which is the first one, Mooladhara Chakra, I will describe it in more details because we don’t have too much time because you must be anxiously waiting for the experience. It is very important and is controlling or manifesting the pelvic plexus outside. Now we scientists know about the pelvic plexus being placed there. This pelvic plexus also has got 4 sub plexuses. In the same way this centre also has got 4 petals. Now you know what is a pelvic plexus is and what it does. It looks after the sex, the excretion of urine and stool. At this place Ganesha was placed because he is like a lotus in the mud and that is why it is important that we must understand about our sex life, and we must know that we have to be correct in our ideas about sex life.

Those people who say that we can excite Kundalini through sex are immoral people. They are sinful people; they are teaching you how to commit sin. This is your Mother, so why is she sitting down there? And if you want to put your sex onto your Mother, what do you call it? I was shocked. I am so shocked that there is a regular organisation going on in this London which is teaching you how to commit sin, and there are thousands and thousands of people following that sort of an organisation.

I think it is a very wrong thing and absolutely condemnable blasphemy. Apart from that it is punishable, and if they have any fear of divine laws, they should give up all these ideas and take to a proper life. It doesn’t mean any kind of fanaticism. It means that you should lead a good married life. It doesn’t mean that you should take to sanyasa. Sanyasa is against Sahaja, it is absolutely against Sahaja. If someone is a sanyasi, know that there is some sort of a danger in this man. Sanyasa is another show. What is there to show that you are a sanyasi? if you have sanyasa within you, you are there, you are a sanyasi. Why to put a cloth or a dress to show that you are a sanyasi? All these extreme behaviours of life are not needed.

To achieve that state, you have to stabilise yourself, still, stabilise, do not go to extremes. There is no need to go to extremes. It is in the central path you have to be, not to go to one extreme or to another extreme. Actually, when you go too much to one extreme you will definitely go to the other extreme. It happens like that, like a pendulum you move from one to another.

For example, you know in this country people were very materialistic. They thought that matter was very important. They were building up, doing this, doing that. Now when it is over, you, young people have discovered that, “Oh God what is all this? This is not joy giving.” So, you also have moved to another extreme.

No, it is not that way! It is in the centre, you have to be in the centre, in a complete balancing way, in a stabilising way to achieve your self-realisation. It is in the central path that the Kundalini rises, not on the left or the right. That is the path called as Sushumna Nadi, and this is the bridge which is made when you are facing a person who knows who is authorised to give you realisation. This bridge is created within you through what? Through what I call as Chaitanya Lahari, is the cool vibrations which are described even in the bible, the cool vibrations of the Holy Spirit.

So where do these vibrations come in? Are they within you? They are not yet felt in your central nervous system, you cannot feel them. The Spirit emits them. When you are enlightened, the Spirit starts emitting those vibrations, and by that you can feel it within yourself. The different centres that are within you, you can feel them, which is mistaken. We have shown here the different chakras that are represented on the hands where you feel it.

For example, here you see the second chakra, is the Swadishthan chakra. You feel on the left-hand side the Swadishthan Chakra. When do you feel on the left-hand Swadishthan chakra? [You feel on the left Swadishthan chakra] when a person is unauthorised, is using unauthorised ways of handling the side, like psychologists. All the psychologists catch on this centre.

When do you catch it again? Is when a person is over hard working, that is called as 'ati karmi' in the book of Gita. 'Ati karmi' is the one who works very hard for material things and for physical being and doing all kinds of yoga at the same time just to have a nice body or to have a nice house or to have a nice aura of material well-being. Such a person always catches on the left [right?] Swadishthan. What is the disease you get out of it? Diabetes is the first that shows you are so imbalanced that the balance has to be created and you get the catch on the left-hand side, means you get the diabetes. You can get the kidney trouble; you can also get some trouble with your spleen.

On the left-hand side [of the brain] the other catch would be the left [right?] Swadishthan could also give you a kind of a very dry personality. You could be a very dry personality, extremely dry. It dries out your warmth, your sweetness. That’s why you find in this world people you see so called intellectuals the way they talk sometimes you feel you are talking to a machine. There is no feeling in that person. You just talk to that person, you feel, “What is the matter with this person, what has happened to him, why is he so abnormal?

In the same way, you can see all these centres shown here, one by one. These are, can be felt on your fingers once you are realised and you can correct them. You can find out about the truth. For example, if you want to find out, "Is there God?", you put your hands like this and ask this question in your heart. And you will get the cool breeze, means it says here. For the first time, you enter into the temple of truth, that you can ask a question, you can get an absolute answer. Any one of you who are realised, all of them will get the same answer. If it’s a small child, he will say the same thing. If they are old people, they will say the same thing.

But I have seen that people who come to Sahaja Yoga are very slow to move because we want it set (défini-montré), we want some sort of a camatkaar, we want to see something that is something so fantastic. We want sensation. But we have to get something permanent. Something of very permanent nature which is for our being, which has to happen, as evolution has to go forward and this is a step human beings have to cross into. They jolly well have to cross it, they have to have it. Those who will not do, will have to take to another force and that force is very dangerous!

So, it is better that you take to the course of evolution and know your own power and enjoy yourself, because not only you will know the truth, the absolute truth, but you will know what we call ‘the all-pervading power’. You can, from here, tell about others, what’s wrong with them, because you jump into collective consciousness. You start feeling other people. Sitting down here, you can see what’s wrong with this person, what’s wrong with that person. You can even correct that person. Even only thinking about them you can help. Of course, when you get this enlightenment, physically you are all right, mentally you are all right, emotionally you are all right.

Now there are many people in Sahaja Yoga who have been cured of cancer. In London itself, [there is] a very famous person who has been cured of cancer. Cancer can only be cured through Sahaja Yoga. I have told this thousands of times. But when they get cancer only, they will come to me, not before. Till they get the cancer, they will wait. They will not take it up seriously until they get cancer or some sort of a trouble. If they come to me, they will only come when they are sick and about to die.

Instead of that, if you take to Sahaja Yoga seriously, you will never get cancer. Not only that but you can cure other people because you are working on the parasympathetic which is the balancing thing. How it is cured, how it works out? Everything can be learnt without paying a single pie (paise) to me or to anyone who knows about it. It is a very simple thing how these physical ailments can be cleared by clearing all these centres because these are the centres which are underlying forces which control all our other organs which we call ‘the autonomous system’. Once you can control these centres, you can control all of them and you can have a very beautiful health. No problems with your health.

But this is just a kind of attraction, that it is a chocolate on top of the inside, because I have seen mostly people come to Sahaja Yoga when they are absolutely sick. But are you seeking only that? Then you will get cured, again you will have some other disease, then again, you’ll get cured and have another a third disease.

The other day, I cured somebody of heart attack. Absolutely he was cured, angina was cleared out and everything was clear. But then again after 5 or 6 months he comes to me, “Oh Mother I am getting a stomach pain, oh I have stomach trouble.” I said, “What did you do about it?” He said, “Nothing, I was very happy, I went home and I was thankful to you.”

Now if this life is cleansed, it has to be enlightened. Now if it has to be enlightened then it has to give light to others or it has to just rust out. If anybody works on you, on your chakras, cures you, fills you up with all that is promised, you have to give light to others. You have to know about it, you have to cleanse yourself, you have to understand yourself, and not to just get lost and then again arise after 8 months and say, “Oh Mother this was the problem I had, and I had a terrible time and I don’t know, I have come back again.” It is very common with many people who come to me, they say, “Oh Mother, once we are realised, we should be alright, we should be just like great people.” Really?

You see we have a marketing attitude towards things. That we have come to Mataji we have obliged her, “Now she has given us realisation and we have obliged her. Now it is her duty to see that we are fully there at that level of Realisation.” Now this is not the way because you must have understood we are talking about the Divine Power, about God. There is a certain protocol about it. What have you given to Him for all this? And that is what fails in people that they do not know how to sustain Sahaja Yoga and how to keep to it. Which is a very simple thing. Not much has to be done but you must sustain it. Do not take it for granted and that’s how I find many people come, they get realisation, enjoy themselves, for about 5/6 weeks or 5/6 months, or maybe 5/6 hours, again back on the same.

Because there are two forces that work on us is as shown here from the left and the right, the ego and the superego. At the very beginning the ego and the superego are sucked in but again they come up, especially the ego in this great ego-oriented society and the ego comes back. And you see your ego, the colossal one coming on you and then you start mingling with it and you get to it. Even this portion which opens out which is called as Sahasrara the top bone, when it opens out, even that gets covered and calcified. So, Sahaja Yoga is not a trick like that, it is not a sensation by any chance. It is a happening within.

The second thing that happens to you that, when you start giving this Divine Power to others, you start gradually deepening into your own being and feeling your source of joy. Life becomes full of joy and happiness. That joy and happiness must be your own, has to be there but it is lost and it has to be found out and once found it has to be sustained, has to be kept aloft. Like you get into the boat, you are still just feeling dizzy, you are still falling out. Now somebody asked me, “When do we feel we are steady?” When you are steady, you are steady. It is that simple.

Some people of course once they got realisation, even they got it on my photograph. Some of them, just got their realisation from the photograph, they are still realised. But some of them I have worked for hours together, months together, and years together, and still they go back to the same level.

I am here to work for you because I am your Mother. I am going to work very hard. No doubt I worked very hard and I have worked very hard, everyone knows that. What’s about you? You have to also love yourself. You have to also understand that this should happen to you, it should be your experience and that you should sustain within yourself. And then you will know your fulfilment that now you have become one with that all pervading power and that is the time when now you can really give it to others.

And you will be amazed what wonders you can do. There are some people here who have done wonders. And then you will know how powerful you are and so far, you have not been at all introduced to your Self, as in Sanskrit they say, ‘Anabhigya’ – ‘No knowledge of yourself’. How powerful you are!

For that you need not be a Prime Minister or you need not be a great personality. On the contrary many people who are simple, who are normal, who are in the centre, ordinary people who we call it, are the best for Sahaja Yoga. Those extraordinary people take time because they have lots of complications around them and they are very difficult but for simple people Sahaja Yoga works wonders.

In London, you know, we have lots of people here who have got it, and around London and outside in England we have lots of people who have got Realisation. But today is a special day which we are celebrating which was 5th May 1970, that was the day when this last Sahasrara was opened out. That was the day I saw the opening. It was definitely tongues of flames with round flames with all colours opening out like living flames very silent and moving and extremely compassionate. You could feel that compassion opening out fully. And I saw the lotus opening like that with many colours. And in the centre was the Agnya Chakra I could see that had brought it up the Kundalini upward. And that was a sign that now en masse realisation could be started because it has to be en masse.

Many people have to get realisation otherwise nobody is going to believe that there is God or that there is All Pervading Power or there is any Spirit. Already people have challenged God without knowing what foolish things they are doing. Then you will realise what is this All Pervading Power and how it works and then the whole thing looks like a drama. It is all mithya. It is all falsehood you see, start seeing it. Once you start seeing it then the whole thing becomes a joke and you see the game, you see yourself as a witness of the whole game and you are not involved into it.

I think we should now go in for realisation because telling about Kundalini is not so easy. It is a tremendous thing and cannot be explained in one lecture and I have already got say 84 lectures they have got for which they are going to bring out and still I have not been able to cover the whole thing. But we have now been able to compile something, a book called “The Advent” by Gregoire de Kalbermatten who is here now, and we have been able to publish that book in Delhi and for which we have really at least I should say how many thousands people, I didn’t count, but thousands of people and lots of them got realisation, and this book has been really very much comprehensive. You can get that book and read it. But still experiencing is different, understanding is different. That book covers a very little part of the whole thing, but still it gives you a good introduction to the subject which can open your eyes to reality. I hope they have some pamphlets here also to give you the first understanding of the thing.

It is a serious thing, it is not a joke, it is not just putting something into your head and finishing off. It is a very serious thing and has to be taken up seriously. Though it is very serious, it is fully enjoyable. I cannot remain serious for more than 10 minutes because it is all a joke for me.

So, once you become that, it is very, very simple and a very, very normal thing. But before that, you have to take it up with understanding and with respect and regard towards yourself. If you are really seeking you will do it. We have had people very difficult cases who have achieved it and who have done it. So, I do not think that it will be difficult for you to get this realisation and to achieve it, to sustain it, to learn about it and to give it to others.

May God bless you all.

If you have any questions, you can ask me for about 5 or 6 minutes but ask sensible questions, just wasting your time and my time is not a good thing. Just ask me very sensible questions because as I said it, it has to happen to you. It is your own power. You have to get it, you don’t have to pay for anything, I don’t need anything from you, nothing you can give me.

So, if you have to take, change your attitude if you are taking from me, not giving me. I am not asking for votes; I am not asking for anything. You might not have met a person like me before. But think it over that you have to take from me and it is a gift to you. So before taking the gift, don’t open the mouth of the horse, try to understand what it is and then ask me sensible questions because just wasting your time is not good. I will be very happy to answer your questions if they are sensible and good enough and if they are helping you, because there must be some questions which must be asked.

(Inaudible question is asked.)

That is a good question, a very good question. You see a very good question. That is a very good question that is, “Sahaja Yoga is a religion?”

Now what is a religion according to you? First of all, the question comes back to you, “What is a religion?” When you said if it is a religion then I would like to know what a definition of a religion is from your side. So, I will tell you what is a religion and what is Sahaja Yoga.

The idea of our religion is, I mean what we call as religion is that you find certain truths about things like “There was Christ”, alright, “He lived on this earth, he did this, he did that.” So, some people take it up. They are not realised souls, they have not sensed the divinity, they have not known what is Divine Light. They take up the authority upon themselves, they organise it. Now “This is the religion”, say, “of Christianity.” And the same about Hinduism. Some pundits get together, they have some dry discussions among themselves and they are not realised, they never read also Adi Shankaracharya and they start a religion.

You cannot start a religion. Religion is within you, is the religion of evolution. The religion is in your stomach, do you know that? It is in your stomach existing. Now here if you see the yellow thing, the green thing around, the green is the Void as we call it, or you can call it as Bhavasagara in the Sanskrit language as they call it. This portion is sustained by religion, means every human being has a sustainer.

For example, gold has a sustaining power, alright? Because it is untarnishable, we can say that it has a sustaining power of gold. Correct? In the same way every human being has got a sustaining power as a human being. If he does not have this then he falls in his dharma, in his religion.

Whatever is false, falsely made, is not a religion. That is why people are turning away from religion. Religion exists in your stomach but you can deny it, you can defy it. You can say that, “I don’t believe in it.” You can have cancer of the stomach, you may have some disease because of that. Fanaticism is not religion. Fanaticism is a disease. I am not talking of disease; I am talking of something that is within you.

So, if you think evolution is a religion then I would say that Sahaja Yoga is a religion. If your evolution if you call it is a religion then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmatit, beyond your dharma.

We have amongst ourselves Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all that people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves as a religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is a religion because I say the religion in the stomach is looked after by the deities of Primordial Master who we call as Dattatreya in the Sanskrit language. I don’t mean in Hinduism. It doesn’t mean Hinduism at all but it is called as Dattatreya in the Sanskrit language, in English it’s Primordial Master. He is the same who incarnated on this earth as Moses, as Abraham, has incarnated as Muhammed Sahib, as Raja Janaka, as Nanaka, and also as Shirdi Sai Nath. Can you believe that Muhammed Sahib is the same as our Nanak?

Now in the religion of these people the Muslims so-called and the so-called Sikhs are fighting amongst themselves, can you believe that Mahavira and Buddha were the same as Hassan and Hussain, which we can prove it to you on vibrations and on curing people.

They were the same people reincarnated just to improve on themselves because people believe into something which they were not, so they were incarnated just to show that, “This was wrong. No, no, this I never said it. This is the truth.”

In the story of Nanaka it was said that once he was sleeping, so they said, “What? You are preaching that there should be unity between Hindus and Muslims and you are putting your feet towards Mecca?” He said, “Really?” Then he turned to the other side. He said, “Mecca has moved.” He was the religion but not his followers. They drink! He allowed them to drink, did he?

When Muhammed Sahib said, “Don’t drink” that means they make a fanaticism out of all that. Fanaticism is not religion. We must understand the difference between the two. The living religion is within us. When you get that light inside, you cannot drink. I never tell people don’t drink before realisation. After that you just don’t drink, you just give up, because you start feeling your Self, the beauty within yourself. When you are bored only you will smoke and drink. When you are enjoying yourself why would you drink?

So, your religion automatically awakens and you just don’t have to bother. Nobody has to tell you that you will get cancer, don’t smoke. 99% just give up smoking without any difficulty and that’s how they save money. People have given up drugs. Horrible things they have given up. You won’t believe, if I tell you that there are some of them sitting here who came to me in dead condition, absolutely in dead condition, they gave it up when they found it.

So, this is a religion that is within you, which is enlightened through Kundalini and then it works out. But it is an absolute religion in the sense that you all feel the same thing. If you feel one finger, the other is also going to feel the same thing. There is no argument about it, there is no argument, everyone will say, “I am feeling this, Mother, so that person is suffering from this trouble or this trouble”, whatever it is. Even if you take 10 children, if they are realised souls, if you tie their eyes, they will say the same thing. And they all will clear out there, every one of them, whether they are Muslims, Hindus, Christians, doesn’t matter.

The other day, I had an Arab lady who came to me whom I have cured, who is realised, she brought another Egyptian to me. He had pain actually on the left side for defects, because on the left side he was affected. But then after the left side was cured, you see, they all started feeling pain here and pain here. So, I said, “Do you get pain here?” and he said, “How do you know that’s the reason I am here to you?” I said, “Do you get pain here?” He said, “Yes throughout.” We cured him also.

A little bit you get pain, just not much, just feeling, just you start suggesting the pain is here and here and here, and with your hands, you can move it and you can take it out.

Many mad people have been cured by coming to Sahaja Yoga because when the enlightenment comes, when the balance comes in, when there is light within you, the darkness goes away. The darkness of the subconscious and of the supraconscious disappears and you become an enlightened person.

If enlightenment is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is. There is nothing discarded of all the religions, nothing is discarded but it is enlightened and brought forth and told to you that this it is. What was Buddha? Do you know who was Buddha, how he was brought? Do you know who was Mahavira?

Now those people who worship Mahavira, if they are fanatics, they are really, if you go to see them really, you will go mad with them, you will not understand what’s the matter, what sort of an interpretation is this of Mahavira, or of Buddha or of Rama or of Krishna or of Christ. And when you start feeling these fanatic people in the name of religion, oh God, any religion, [you] get out of it.

It is correct, I must say, you, young people, have seen to it, but still don’t go away from God. You see, always you have seen in this world everything that is beautiful is covered with something ugly, because it is a market, you want to sell something in the market. Religion you cannot sell in the market. They are selling religion. If you read any one of these people there, see £50,000,000 for this, £30,000,000 for this, for raising this organisation, for doing this. Is such a headache when I see these things.

The other day I was seeing that picture on the TV of the world that they were organising so much money. And that money, is that God, is that religion?

So, differentiate between the real religion and the unreal one. Fanaticism is not the way to God, it is never the way. It is one side of God but you can go to the other side of denying of God, denying of religion is another side, both are extreme, you have to be in the centre.

Again, I say that you have to be in the centre. Just wait and see and let it happen to you, alright? It was a very good question, beautiful.

Are there any other questions?

(Unheard question is asked.)

The extreme of sanyasi? Alright, perfectly alright! You see one should not think that becoming that, is very important. It’s alright, if you don’t want to do, it it’s alright.

Like vegetarianism also is another fad you see. There are Jains in India who are vegetarians to this limit that they want to be kind to the bugs, so they get the bugs of all the village, they collect it and keep one pundit and put him in the hut and put all the bugs to eat that or drink the blood of that pundit, or what we call as a priest, and that is how they think they are being very kind to bugs. But what are we going to do with the bugs here, you tell me. You see one pundit is better than thousands of these bugs. How if the bugs come here how am I to give them realisation? This is what it is!

You see, if by temperament you do not like sex life, it is perfectly alright, but by becoming a nun if you will find God, is a wrong idea. This is what I am trying to say.

By temperament, if you don’t like to eat flesh and things, it is perfectly alright. But if you think that by becoming vegetarian you are going to achieve God, is wrong.

Not the extreme of anything. Not extreme of anything. Any kind of fanaticism. You see, this is the reason why today God’s name is erased, because of fanatic ideas, we have to understand that. If we have to allow God to work within us, we have to be sensitive, we have to be wise.

Now see this temple is sold out to Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. What would you say to that? Why? Why has church been allowed to Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan? I don’t say there is anything wrong with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan but a church has been sold to Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, a sign of what? People are neglecting religion, so-called. Alright?

So, we have to be sensible and wise about it because we can see the future now. We can see for ourselves what is going to happen to these younger people who are thinking about it. They should not also be allowed to go to another extreme. 26% people in this country believe in God can you imagine? What do they think of themselves? 26% people only believe in God. Out of them 6% must be others, not British. And what do the British think about themselves, that they don’t have faith in God? Whom do they have faith in? I cannot understand. So, it has gone to that limit. Now at least awaken!

Only the poor countries where there is no food, nothing, so you supply food to them. Now supplying food is not God’s work at all, looking after the poor is not God’s work! Who has told you that it is God’s work?

Even Christ has said that, “Poor will be with you always but I am with you for a short time.” If you look after the divinity and the Divine life, and not all these poor people. Let other people do it, let the government do it. Why are you doing the governments job to be philanthropic?

That’s not your job looking after the poor. You see, they are like labours unions there, supplying the poor food. Supplying, what is the need? That’s not the way. Understand that when you have to do for anyone, it is just you do it. You just don’t think you are doing anything great. You just do it because it’s just you feel happy about it. You are just doing it for your own happiness, there is nothing like utkara and all that. You just do it, there is nothing so great to feel proud of it that you have done so much good work and so much good work. It’s all nonsense, this is just ego pampering. What can you do for others, what can you give: dead things like I give a television set to someone or a chair to someone, all dead? Is it going to give joy to anyone? That is not joy giving.

All these great religions through which you were formed and all these organisations should have given some joy to people. They have not! They have failed completely because their attention was never in the seeking, in the finding out of the truth. They were just organising it. Do you understand my point?

There are many ways which we can follow. After getting realisation, there are many ways by which you can watch those thoughts. If you watch, you see, because you are a realised soul yourself, you know, then your attention is enlightened. Just put your attention and the whole thing will subside. It is like a light, if you put light to anything that is darkness, the thing will disappear. It will work out, just put your attention. From where do these ideas come? From your ego or from your superego. Just find out. Because you know all about it, what is the ego and the superego is, what sort of ideas are coming. You can just watch it and you can get rid of that. It is not difficult. You can remain into thoughtless awareness. There are so many ways we have by which you develop yourself [your Self] and grow.

Questions?

(Unheard question.)

Yes, no doubt he said he was a prophet he was the Son of God.

(Unheard question.)

What is Holy Trinity? Holy Trinity is God the Father, God the Mother, and God the Son.

Ask direct questions.

(Unheard questions.)

Just now if you don’t ask direct questions, how can I answer them? That I’ll tell you later on. All right?

You have to find out also certain things. Find out things about me, things about Sahaja Yoga. Because I’m very cautious. I’m very careful because I know the ego of human beings. If you say one thing, they just jump on it.

So, be very careful. But to you I am going to tell because you are realised. First of all, get your realisation before your ego starts jumping about. Alright? Just see it. It’s just for that. It’s just giving you ideas. Just look at that. Tell that to him, “For a while, you get your realisation. Through other ways you are not going to go there.” I told you that’s an instrument which has to chrysalid.

It is effortless. Not by thinking you are going to reach there. It is going to happen to you. It’s a happening. So just wait and see. Don’t allow your mind to take over you because if your mind comes in between, it will find values behind. What has your mind found so far? Nothing. Why depend on your mind?

(Unheard question.)

What is? Conscience? Conscience is the thing that gives you religion. It’s the balancing force. Conscience is the one that is sustainer within you, that’s the one that all the time is giving you balance. That is within you. As I said there is a religion within you. So, the conscience is there. For we are very good acceding it and removing it.

(Unheard question.)

Not allow. Alright? We’ll deal it later.

(Unheard question.)

This Kundalini is placed at the triangular bone. You may not even feel the awakening of it. If you are a smoker, this will be just shoot off. It will not affect. But what you will feel, is absolute calm. And the thoughtless awareness, as they call it, is the first thing where, in Sanskrit language, it is called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Nirvichara Samadhi is the first thing. ‘Samadhi’ means ‘enlightened consciousness’. First the consciousness is enlightened at the same where you are thoughtless.

The second thing where you are rising into, is doubtless awareness, called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi, where there is no doubt left. Between this and that, you are faced with doubts, all sorts of non-sensical doubts. But only remember one thing that, if you have felt the vibrations, if you have felt the coolbreeze, there is something about you. Better go forward with it, better go ahead with it, and work it out.

So, it starts today. Please, put your hands just like this, put your feet on the ground...

(Realisation starts...)
