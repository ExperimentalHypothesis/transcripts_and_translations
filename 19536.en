Shri Mataji: Ok all of you please go a little backwards, nobody will sit here, go backwards, there is plenty of space. Leave at least 6 feet space. You all are sitting like the Royal family.

Yogi: One person has some problem in his leg.

Shri Mataji: Give him some seat to sit, turn the seat, no don’t keep very big keep a small one, keep a cushion He can sit on that. Keep only a cushion, this cushion can’t come out. Keep a small chair the small one. He cannot sit, this is too big, bring a small chair.
Yogi: Mother we need two, Girl should also be seated high on a chair.

Shri Mataji: Yes both of them should sit on the chair.

Shri Mataji: The girls have to sit little back then the man so the man moves forward, yes the bridegrooms will move little forward and the girls should sit little at the back. Yes, it’s better so that we can reduce that’s better. The girls have to sit to the right side of the man and when the boy is giving ahuti, that is when he is giving it to fire the girls have to touch the right hand of the bridegroom so the girls have to sit at the back. All of you move backwards and now leave the hand it’s all right. Leave the hand and sit at the back of the boy's little bit so that you can come closer, all the boys can move forward and the girls at the back, still further, close down, close down. Still, further, Manish come in front. All of you can come closer to the thing, the girls should move behind. All the boys should come closer to the Bedi ( the Secret fire lightened for a wedding) try to accommodate each other, don’t leave places between. Don’t leave spaces in come forward this side. Give this that side Yes.

Tell them to move that side, just move to the right. The facing people move to right a little so these people can be accommodated to your right. All the boys come forward now. Markus again move forward, you have to move much forward. All of you move forward move to the right, now see that everybody adjusted, organise Manish move to the right please sit still, move. Now the girl should be on the right side of the boys. All the girls should move closer to the boys, please. Kishan you should use ghee and oil but wherever you like you can put it whatever you like but with a swaha when he says.

(A yogi discussed something in Marathi. Shri Mataji is laughing and saying that there is nothing give and take in this. There is no dowry system, most of a headache is off when you don’t have a dowry system, no giving and taking the business.) That’s the best way, isn’t it? So relaxed, can you believe fourteen marriages are taking place and no tension at all, everybody is enjoying. Better give up you will all enjoy marriage

Yogi: Mataji what about us, when will we get married.

Shri Mataji: You can marry next year. All you can do, you should get remarried again.

Yogi: With whom.

Shri Mataji: with each other, those who are not married. Are you married or not?

Yogi: Not.

Shri Mataji: then it’s all right. That’s what I am saying. (Shri Mataji and yogis are laughing.)

So you will have to have another marriage, Sahaja yoga marriage, make it a blissful marriage.

Now tell you what he is doing one by one. First is Agni Devta because before the Agni, before the fire your promise. The fire has the capacity to cleanse everything. To bring it real value, bring it ’s the principle, that’s why you are doing it before the fire. So first we have to worship the fire so that the fire purified itself and that it’s Kundalini is awaken and once the fire goes to its essence because you are saints and realised souls. It will burn away all that is bad and will bring the real value, the principle of marriage in you. Yes! Start it so with swollen feed and serenity you have to know that you all are saints and saintly brides. Whatever you are doing you have to do it with full awareness. All the brides and Bridegroom should meditate in your heart inviting Her in your heart. Fold your hands and do naman to Her Holiness Mataji and invite Her.

Now the girls should touch the right hand.......

(Mantras)

Shri Mataji: Put the vibrations in the fire it will work out. Tell him to put fire all the four sides then all the people will put the samgri in it. Put the wood on another side also, keep some wood this side also. go, keep both the sides. The fire will catch slowly.

Do one thing, spread this till last. Brother, spread it till the last point then it will keep burning till last put some more samvidha in a row (the wood pieces used for havan). Put them in a line till last. I am saying that put some more samvidha till the end. Put them all the four sides, it will keep spreading. Don’t worry about the fire, it will spread slowly, don’t worry about that, only spread the samvidhas. Everybody loves to watch. Put them till last, up to all four corners, it will spread itself. Did anybody go to get samvidhas. The wedding is such a collective thing It took four to reach. We could reach in time because all the girls were ready in time and boys also got ready. Don’t keep it up, keep it aside, keep them till the bricks, spread them in all the four directions.

Shri Mataji: “Mr Chandra keep the Bhasam ( ashes of the havan) of the havan, I will tell you, first of all, you keep the basam in a bowl for puja.

Ladies must touch the hands of the boys when they are putting the aahuti.

Did you complete 108 names? Gavin has got 108 names. 108 names, Gavin you say that.

Now you all have to get up slowly, now put the knot, all the boys got cloth around them, some married ladies should do that, not unmarried ladies should do that. Take it around your neck, you see boys should take around their neck so the loose thing should fall on your left-hand side. Loose end should fall on the left side. Now the ladies who have tied have to open it later, so remember whom you have tied. (Mother is laughing)

In marriages, there are so many small small things which are very cute and they bring sweetness in the relationship. See there is no tension, nothing, everybody is getting joy. The boys who are not yet married should go as young brothers, all of them should join as brothers. Yes go, go there, give a camera to him. All of them have to stand next to the fire, boys have to stand next to the fire. All the young boys little boys or the once who are not married, not those who are about to be married, not that kind. Every couple should know which is the brother of the bride.

Shri Mataji: why did you do, just tell them not to publish anything we don’t want just tell them. Where is? That see, you see people do everything offend without asking, very easy, this is something I don’t understand why should have done. Just now I threw him out from taking, they are not to leak, without asking me. Please telephone him not to publish anything.

Yogi: All the boys should keep that paper bowl of kheer in their right hand. You should eat food that is cooked by the all brothers and sisters and if taken outside the home you will vibrate it. I will be loyal to you.
