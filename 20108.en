2001-12-26 Talk during Evening Program At Christmas Seminar, Ganapatipule, India

Shri Mataji: I have no words to praise this Dance, Drama by these children. Their innocence has given such colour and such a beauty to the whole description a simple song. I am sure all of you enjoyed it ...I enjoyed it very much. Our children are growing so well in Sahaja yoga that I am amazed ...How could they take to these difficult subjects of spirituality so easily...May God bless them all that they grow as great Sahaja yogis and do the work of Sahaja Yoga. All my best wishes for Dharamshala school. I didn't know It was creating such beautiful, sweet, talents. Thank You very much!
