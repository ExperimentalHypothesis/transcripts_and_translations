 Shri Mahadev Puja 25 February 2001, Pune greatest power to destroy. His destruc- tion suddenly because He Today we are here to celebrate Mahashivratri. It's a comes so very great priviledge for all of us to rules all the elements. All the elements He understand about Shri rules, He rules the Mahadeva. Unless Mother Earth and He and until you have got all other rules your Self Realisation elements through their you cannot under- stand what is the great causals. He rules and ะะต destroy personality, character and the the can everything that He wants to if He finds there is problem. I have to tell you that Shri of power Mahadeva. It's not easy to conceive, also to reach the depth of His greatness, unless and until we are humble. We have to be very humble to reach at the lotus feet of Shri Mahadeva. earthquakes are managed by him, not by me. I am not there for the destruction. He is the one who sees what's happening on this earth, what's happening to the human beings. As you have seen that one has to cross even the Sahasrara to be at the lotus I will give you an example of Gujarat. teet of this great personality. He is Apart from anything, Gujarat's people are beyond - resides in our hearts as the spirit and is reflected very well when you get your realisation. But still one has to very money oriented, they are worried because of stock exchange, this, that, all the time money, money, money, beyond our conception but He money, money. Even if they are abroad they are extremely money oriented, Sometimes I am surprised, it's impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga, and they like artificial types of things like some gurus or somebody. I don't know from where did they get this. Whatever it is, we have a state called understand the powers of Shri Mahadeva. It is not very easy to describe about this Great God in little words. The first power He Himself has that He is a very forgiving God. He forgives. He forgives so many of our sins, so many of our destructive activities, our horrible Bhavnagar in Gujarat. Bhavnagar people came, they brought for me those silver slippers 'Padukas' to be vibrated. I was mind which tries to create problems for every one, upto a point but He has the

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 surprised. I was happy at least that these people are thinking over it, so they did a Puja, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar and also in Baroda. These are the two places powers, all those powers are used to protect my work, I should say. It goes too far and it is to show to people that they shouldn't obstruct the work of spirituality. It should be real spirituality. It should not be somebody like a false guru coming up and showing some magic or talking something about some far fetched things, but the real spirituality, if you have the protection, will be always there and the Shiva will be very blissful. which were not touched even - touched even by the 'bhukamp', by the earthquake. Can you imagine? Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered. There are Sahaja Yogis, very few, all of them were saved and their houses also did not move. This is between the protection of your Mother and the wrath of God Almighty. One has to understand this very well that He has powers over all the elements; I went to France, and there are some people in France who tried to trouble, and all the media got after me. On the television, everywhere, they were saying all kinds of things against me. I knew something He is extremely blissful, and what does He give you is even more beautiful than you could think of. He is extremely forgiving. I should say He is the source of forgiveness. If you have forgiveness in your heart, He resides in your heart otherwise gradually you start developing very difficult type of diseases. Say, if you are not forgiving, your heart runs very fast. No one can touch your heart, you would go wrong, somewhere and suddenly from the sea, a big, I don't know what to call it, a big storm started. Suddenly, no one knows about it and two ships were completely sunk and those people who went to rescue them, got cancer. Then this storm started moving fast and all the churches lost their top heads, I should say. All the Churches lost it. So many priests' houses were ruined and it travelled and came upto the place where I had purchased a very big castle. Just stopped and just stopped at cannot get heart attacks but if you are tolerating, suffering and taking many things as a power of your own doing wrong things and forgetting about God then you also start developing a very big heart. So one side is that you develop a heart which is extremely aggressive and can become like Hitler's heart. Under any kind of pretentions if you start torturing someone, your heart becomes solid and then you can get a tremendous massive heart attack and all the troubles come. This is inevitable, but supposing you are the brink of it. extremely tolerant and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile, you are frightened person, if you are frightened and because of fright you do that, you can develop another kind of a heart, we Now, it's not my doing, I must tell you, but this is what He does. Though He is very forgiving, He is extremely kind, He is blissful but you should be aware of His

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII issue 5 & 6 May-June 20001 When you believe in eternal life, in call as angina, where the blood supply is less and ultimately you develop a kind spiritual life, you should not be governed of a guilt and you have a very mediocre by any such nonsensical atrocities. And life. So this second thing also is very that's why I feel that you really need the miserable among people who think they emancipation of women in India. They are very-very tolerant. I am saying that are very good, they are very tolerant, tolerance is alright because of spirituality, they are very sweet but they develop all but not because you are frightened and you are afraid of something. If you are a Sahaj Yogi you have no business to be they don't know their own self respect. afraid of anything. In India people are afraid of everything, if they see a squirrel Why should men behave like that? I think they get frightened, if they see a lizard, in our country we have atleast 70% finished. I mean they are afraid of women and the 70% people's energy is anything and the ladies of India are so wasted in the North India. I don't know afraid of even cockroaches. This kind of what they think of themselves! Then they temperament is absolutely stupid are punished. All such countries can because that makes you a kind of a never prosper because women are the person who is prone to angina. What is Lakshmis. But they have to be Lakshmis there to be afraid of? If you are a Sahaj also, they have to behave like Lakshmis. Yogi and Sahaj Yogini, you are not be Some of them come up like this that you afraid of anything. They are afraid of rats! All kinds of nonsense, and they boast of they look like devils! It's such an it and they talk about it, their heart is imbalance in the society which is becoming weak and weak and weak. punished again by Shri Mahadeva. He Also I must say the Indian men are responsible for it because they treat their who have suffered and He tries to punish women as if they are appendages or people who made them suffer. It is his some sort of a liability. I don't know what quality to help by destroying people who they think them to be. Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable. Specially in North Kundalini, He doesn't talk of Self India, I have seen, women have no position. The women is brought in the nicely, in such a bad way that is house, kept in the house just like a maid shocking. I have seen many women who servant, she has to cover her face all the lived like this, suffered so much. They time, she doesn't have to go out any die much earlier than their age. All this, where without permission. It's terrible. one has to see in the right perspective. Some people say it is the Muslim Heis there to protect of course, but more influence about every thing. the bad diseases, all the mental diseases because they don't know their own value, On this I have already spoken at length are shocked. How can they be women, is very kind and He looks after the people are aggressive. He doesn't talk of Realisation. He just punishes them to destroy. He protects all kinds of

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 great heights of Himalayas. He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very the joy, all the joy of spirituality, but if noble and He wants that people should love each other, there should be pure animals, all birds, all the nature He protects. He is the one who brings all you try to become aggressive then He is the one who will destroy. Sometimes he love among human beings. Also He makes you very delicately behaving people think, we are alright, we have towards other people, very sweetly behaving towards others. If you don't have that then you are going in the wrong gives more long rope to hang, and so satisfied Him, On the contrary in the West I find the direction. women are ruling the men more than the men, very surprising! I don't know how they have handled the situation but they are ruling all the time and the men have to be under their thumb. I don't know how His greatest thing is that He gives you the height and the depth! If you are worshipping Him then you develop such heights that you see the whole world as they have managed it, but they do it! They are not humble, they don't love and a witness. He sees the whole world as a Sakshi Swaroopa' as a witness and so they will go on divorcing their husbands all the time.They do not love! They don't know what the love is, but also I have seen men don't understand what love is He is the knowldge. He is the pure knowledge. You may get your realisation alright, you might feel cool breeze in your hands, alright, but do you have the knowledge? I have to tell you what finger means what, what hand means what, what is vibrations, I have to tell you. He is that knowledge, is pure knowledge, complete knowledge of the highest level. So He is the source of knowledge. Those in India. They don't know how to love their wives, which is a life partner! How to respect, they don't understand! There, then comes a great wrath and this wrath works in so many ways in creating horrible diseases and in creating problems and problems for such men. The society also is responsible for doing all kinds of things against humble people. people who are not humble cannot get that knowledge, those people who are arrogont and who do not handle others delicately, sweetly, beautifully, are not blessed by Him. They cannot achieve anything in life. What do we have to achieve? Not your position, not your wealth, not all these outward things but you have to achieve a loving heart, heart with which you can love. If there is Shiva in your heart you will love everyone in a very beautiful way. Both ways one has to understand that if you are aggressive you are under the third eye of Shri Mahadeva. In any way if you are aggressive, say, with your servant, if you are aggressive with your subordinates, if you are aggressive with your children, there is this wrathful God watching and one can get under the spell of His destruction. But He gives us the

 May June 2001 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XilII Issue 5 & 6 You are not to fight in the name of God but you have to love and understand. So this fighting in the name of God is a nonsense; not only that but it is very-very dangerous. All such people who will do that will be destroyed. It is There won't be any nonsensical ideas about love, just pure love, pure love for all the people is the blessing. Then all your harshness goes away. For example- if you have a little power - little power, so you start misusing it. Look at Shiva. He has so many powers. If He self destructive. Such people will be starts misusing, there won't be even a destroyed completely. So you should blade of grass left on this earth. How understand that in the name of God you much we are sinful, selfish, He knows, have to love, you have to understand. that. But still He gives you a chance, say You need not tolerate nonsense, it's let's see they might improve! He is different, but you have to love people - extremely spread your love. Gradually this love can go all over the world and then the vision extremely generous generous. He is very forgiving and also extremely generous. Now supposing of mine, I can see, working out but if there there are people who are living in a is fighting, there's hatred, there's all kind desert and they are very good people of aggressiveness, these are all against Shiva and such people will be destroyed. living in a desert. He will create oasis for What will I do with them? What can I do them. He controls the Mother Earth, He if they are destroyed? If they are very can do every thing to make them happy money oriented, materialistic people, it they are spiritual, if they worship Him. they are not loving. They love you only But human beings are so stupid that for money. All such people will be they go on fighting also in the name of destroyed, no doubt. One should be not God. Like in the South we have two only humble but should be extremely types of people-one who worship loving. To get the blessing of Shiva you have to be extremely loving. Such people you imagine! Vishnu used to worship may not be very cunning, clever, may Shiva. Nobody is higher, no body is be very innocent, must be, because lower. It's so important, everything is so when you love somebody you want to important. But they used to fight on this help that person. I have suffered myself, point that they are worshipping Shiva or I have tried to help people and they have they are worshipping Vishnu, and no deceived me. So what! That's their where near the reality they went. They nature and they are destroyed. What can did not know what was the reality. Ido? I didn't ask them that you deceive nothing. Just fighting, fighting, fighting. me but they deceived me. I don't know, In the name of God those who fight, why? I have been very kind and nice- still they deceived me! So then the destruction follows, what can I do about and they are suffering because they are Shiva another who worship Vishnu. Can Shiva comes on them and His trident hits them.

 6. May - June 2001 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 it? I don't want anybody to be destroyed. I love this creation of mine and I don't have any way of protecting them if they are destructive. Because there's another have to obey and when the king is there, it is the prtocol. They know automatically what is the protocol of the king, nobody would be even moving if he is there. He sits in his majesty. Then in one week or may be even fifteen days he will kill one great power who can destroy them. I am in a helpless condition sometimes. I don't animal. He has to eat, kills one animal, then he and his family they eat first. He waits for sometime, ofcourse, for the. know how to express but one has to understand as a Sahaj Yogi that with Shiva's love and His blessings you can become extremely loving, extemely blood to ooze out then the whole family comes and eats. Then he leaves the generous, very-very sweet and innocent like children. body there. Then by gradation one by one all kinds of animal come and eat it You have to be innocent. There's no as a prasad. And the last are the crows need to be very clever and cunning. And who come and eat that animal. Such you will be amazed how your innocence- discipline, such understanding of the will be protected! If you are innocent, you protocol. I am amazed how animals are don't have to worry. There's a power - managed by Shiva! We never hear that the third eye of Shiva looking after you. Wherever you are going, it is with you. That doesn't mean that you become stupid, doesn't mean that you are not stealing things but you just imagine we practical, all that is taken over, all the are coming from that animal life but we practical side by the power of Shiva. His guidance, His love, His kindness, you can see at every step of life, But first of behaving in such a manner of fighting! all watch your steps. Are you On any small little excuse they will fight, aggressive? Are you troublesome? Do they start fighting! Animals also fight little you say harsh things to others or are you bit among themselves but not in a humble? Are you gentle? And if you are kind, He is very much pleased. In the nature it is His rule that works and they the slightest provocation we get into are so systematic, they live with groups and start fighting. They get into understanding of each other. For groups but they don't fight. What is the example, if you go in a jungle and it is thing among them? Everything is so absolutely quiet, don't hear even the birds twittering, then you should know why not for us also to understand the there's a tiger sitting somewhere, law of nature. It is Mahadeva who because he is the king. They know they manages that, all the nature's laws are animals are having a strike or animals are having a You don't hear that these animals are big underworid animals. are worse than them! How are we going to rise if we have all such funny ideas of collective way. They do not do it in a collective way as we do it here, but at much - so much understood by animals,

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIllI Issue 5 & 6 May-June 2001 in the West I have seen people love their the sky, everything, is looked after by wives because of fear! Fear of divorce Him. He does nice-nice beautiful things may be, Idon't know. Love should have for us. With the changing of the seasons no fear, it should be just free love. He creates beautiful flowers. He creates Without any fear, without any aggression all that is soothing, joy giving and enjoy that pure love and that is what is beautiful. He looks after it. He gives us missing in the human beings today as it to see what nature has given us and tries is. When the day will come when human to please us, keep us happy, entertain beings will be understanding the beauty like an innocent child, while we, in our of love then from the Heavens there would be flowers pouring on us. It would thing. You see a carpet, you say I don't be such a tremendous day when like it. Specially in the West it is a Mahadeva will be able to close His third eye and would be peaceful in His heart. are you not to like something or to dislike It's my vision, it's the future for you something? What do you think of to see how peacefully you can talk. How sweelty you can love others? How much you can give to others? or 'I like it'. It's impossible! Such human For example, if they have to give beings, I don't know, where will they go? something they will go in the market and What will happen to them? Instead of buy the cheapest, the rottenest thing for apreciating, instead of enjoying giving. That's not the way. You must buy everything, why to start criticizing and a small or big, what ever it is, out of love, that should talk about your love, tell about West, I must say, not so much in India, your love and not about your money what but there are certain cultural differences, you are spending. It's very common now- I think, that's why people say like that. a-days, even in India, that people try to Here if somebody says like that, people show how much their worth is, what they will think that person is mad or something wear, how they dress up. For what? For what? I have known such people when they die there are not even four people So it's important how you express available to carry their dead body. When your love, how you talk about your love. they live they think no end of themselves. Start it with your wife to begin with and That time you should see how many then you can move towards your children people there are to love that person, to and the other persons. We are so stupid care for that person. May be it is this up sometimes that we love the whole world bringing, may be that he had never known love, anything you may blame. But for a Sahaj Yogi it is important to to be obeyed. Even the Mother Earth, arrogance, have our reactions to every common thing to say, 'I don't like it'. Who yourself? It's very common, and shamelessly they will say, 'l don't like it' reacting? Reaction is much more in the wrong with him the way he talks. but we can't love our wives. It is a speciality in India, that's very true but also

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 like that... shining, cutting out all the wrong things within us, as a diamond is cut to look something very-very great. My only, if I have any, desire is that try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva. Detached He is, detached, absolutely detached. He lives with bones and things like that. He is not bothered about where He lives, what He lives with, learn that love is your life, love is spirituality, and expectations- to do something. Some people are, I know, very good at helping poor people, this, that, but behind that is the power. They think 'O' we are great! We are doing this work, that work. Just to satisfy their power, not their love. So, when you are working you have to know that it is just to satisfy your spirit, just to satisfy your love that you are doing it, not for any name or for any kind of a position. If you have that kind of a detached love, 'Virakta', as they call it, then nobody has to certify you. You have it and you are enjoying it. without love what He has, nothing. So detached and we should be detached like that, at the same time we should be very loving like Him, extremely loving. How His heart is full of love for others! How He looks after us! I am warning you because I know you all love me very much. But you should also love each other, you should have a loving heart and have satisfaction in loving others. If you could develop that, your height will grow, your depth in Sahaj yoga will grow. It's alright, the Goddess gives you the shradhha, alright, but the depth in shradhha in sanskrit, in Hindi and in Marathi, I don't know, what you call but in Marathi they call it 'Dhyas', just deep into that love, drenched into that love, enjoying that love. Then you don't want anything, What do you want? You have got everything so what do you want now! Just like greatness of Shri Mahadeva, He is so great that He is detached. What does He want? I mean It is unfortunate I have to speak in English language, may be there are some who do not understand English, but now-a-days the English has become dominating, we have to speak in English language. I can't use any other language, but one has to speak the language of love. You see animals, you see if you have a horse, if you have a dog, all these animals they understand your love. How they stick to you, how they express their love? They are very sweet. This we have to learn from them, I think, otherwise I don't know how to make them understand the value of love. Please note that the way people are criticizing that we are not practical, that we have not achieved much money or power or nothing is greater than Him, nothing is more important than Him. Then what does he want? He doesn't want anything, that's why He is detached. This detachment you have to develop but at something, that's not important because there are many like that selling in the market. We are different, we are the jewels of humanity and we have to be the same time He is the lord of all the arts, of the music, of the rhythm. The

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May-June 2001 other day you saw these boys were just are bothered about ourselves. Like playing the rhythm. The whole rhythm we ask, "how are you?" 'Mother, I have of everything He creates. The rhythmic got a headache, I have got a stomach life that we have, we are not yet aware trouble. I have another trouble, or of it. See a child is born, after, exactly everything is there. But another one after nine months or so many days. Who would say, "Aha, I am all right". So what's gives this rhythm? Then we get, say, certain flowers at such and such time, 'Mother, why don't you put the world then we get in the nature all kinds of right?' He is worried about others, not these seasons. Who keeps the rhythm? about himself. And in that understanding He is the one who is nothing but rhythm what one should do to make this world and that rhythm is kept up in the nature, happy, beautiful, for that one has to really in everything there's a rhythm and a work hard, so called. And in that working rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart, who is like an ocean. You get just that, this rhythm is disturbed, this world rhythmic, rhythming with our immediately if you find some body is spirit? It is our duty, we have to do it. being very cruel, very bad. But in a Not only taking Sahaj Yoga for your self smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake there is no ripple at all. It's just low and then at time worried about yourself but you are that time if the rhythm, the silent system worried about others. What's happening of that heart is broken, then Shiva takes in the world. That is love. That love is charge. So one has to have a complete spontaneous. And when it works. It sense of the rhythm of time, rhythm of works wonders. nature, rhythm of everything. People do'nt know even the names of the the matter? Put the world in right form, one thinks, Isn't it our duty to make this world beautiful? Isn't it our job to make but for others. It's not that you are all the So this is a beautiful evening where flowers. They do'nt know what these flowers are? What time they come up? of our ascent and I hope you people will They have no idea, what is the system understand how far are you with that of their living. Nobody is bothered. All of force. How much are you drenched in you see, there are seasons, and things. that force, in that rhythm of Shiva, who Its all the rhythm. Like he is playing a in His rhythmic way gives you vibrations. big tabla or a Pakhavaj, on which He Vibrations flow in a wave way and that plays all the beautiful tunes of all the wave should engulf you completely and seasons, and that's how the nature you should be all in that. Your T ness flourishes and comes up and then should be dissolved in that. This is I bless subsides. We do not see that point. We you. Thank you. we are worshipping such a great source

 Ekadasha Rudra Puja 8 June 1988, Vienna out of anger and temper the villainous temperament grew into them and then it formed this anti-God negativity in the void. So void has given actually the villainy to come into form. As you see in Sahaj Yoga, we must have seen it many a times, that when you go to a wrong guru or to a wrong person or you do unauthorised worshipping, your left void catches. So in the left void all those destructive forces act. Also in the process of evolution there were many plants, animals who were destroyed because they were not in the centre, because they were egoistical, some were cunning, some were too big, some Today is a very important day in the history of spirituality. The Ekadasha Rudra incarnation has been prophesied by every prophet. That the Ekadasha Avtara will be coming and it will destroy all the negativity, all the anti-God activities. Ekadasha principle, actually, were too small. They were all thrown out, and when they were thrown out they felt that they must react. So, they went into the collective subconscious, and came as subtler entities to harm the people who were aesthetic. Like we see these days the viruses that attack us. These is built in void, because when the saints are the plants which have gone out of wanted to cross the ocean of illusion circulation. Alter some time we will find through their meditation, they were tobacco will go out of circulation, many hindered, troubled, tortured and drugs will go out of circulation. All these can form a kind of a anti-growth, anti- development, anti-freedom forces within slaughtered by negative forces. These negative forces came up through the failings of human beings. When human beings failed, they saw other people who ourselves. were so much better than them, and they So in the area of void these horrible negative forces were formed. In the saw that they are nowhere compared to many other human beings, or sometimes same way many human beings who

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May June 2001 11 we see today, these forces are acting in a very subtler manner, in a manner that human beings cannot understand, and they remain in it. If you see the way we are drifting from reality, the way we are were born and tried to assert their ego, went into egoistical processes and thought that they can control people, they can have their domain over all the human beings, they can overpower the getting tempted by superficial nonsensical things, the way we have horrible diseases waiting at our whole world.. all such people form a very powerful institution in the history. Today also there are many such forces coming into existence. These forces are building and destroying every moment. They are building into our void area and doorsteps, we realise that we are standing on the verge of falling into a mire from where we may never rise, we may never come up. So we have to then they are destroying. These people when they come from the right side, from the right void, we call them as understand what is within us which can destroy forever these anti-development, anti-evolutionary, anti-constructive temperament of the nature. In the nature, if you see, every thing circulates in a very regular manner. For example, in the supra-conscious and those who come from the left side, we call them as the subra-conscious entities. All these entities do exist as the human winter time the leaves have to fall down being are the image of God, as in the because the nitrogen of the leaves has collective sub-conscious of God- Almighty and also in the supra-conscious to go into the Mother Earth to nourish the trees. Moreover, the Mother Earth of God-Almighty. These forces still remain till they go to hell. In the same must get the Sun's rays. So there should way, in that person, in human beings be no leaves and the Sun's rays can penetrate into the Mother Earth to nourish her. Then the trees when they are nourished they again become green also, these forces exist and they try to overpower us. and lush so that they receive the Sun's light and make chlorophyll out of them. Also they suck the water from the Mother Earth and throw them in the atmosphere to act as catalyst for the rain to come. Then the rain comes during the rainy season, then again nourished with water they lose all their leaves and whole circle It is very remarkable that we have this Puja in Austria. Because in the geography of this world, Europe is the void and in that Austria is the one where we should have anti-negative forces built up to fight the negative forces. It is such a right place to have this Puja, and I am really thankful to all the Sahaj Yogis who have chosen this place for EKADASHA RUDRA PUJA. In the modern times, as goes on in a beautiful manner. There is no reversion, it is just a continuous circle

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 12 that you are shocked and surprised. There is a gentleman whom I have given realisation is very dedicated but he is not in a place where he can come to Sahaj going in a beautiful manner to create and recreate. But with the interference of man nature gets disturbed. Also you can enhance the nature. You can save the nature's destruction, which could be Yoga and some people tried to trouble him very much and he told me that these natural also. But when you get your all met with an accident and all of them realisation, then with your vibrations you can save all natural things that are are now lying in the hospital. So, I said, I did not do anything. By their own doings they have crossed the limits, and if you cross the limits of goodness, naturally decaying under the modern influence. So, first of all we see the effect of realisation. How it acts as EKADASHA you do something, what we call as evil. And if you fall into the ditches of evil, you have to suffer. But also it acts on Sahaj Yogis. I have known of Sahaj Yogi, who tried to be little funny about money. I did not think that he should be punished, I RUDRA? It destroys the negative forces which are trying to destroy the nature. One day, I am sure, you all will evolve to such a state that even your glance is sufficient to make the trees grow, to make the fruits sweet, to make the never thought of such thing that he should be punished, really. But they acted, his own forces acted against him and he got so sick, so very sick that in my presence he used to just shake like a dried leaf. I never even told him that I know what you are doing! flowers fragrant. That is possible because our growth is showing results. Slowly, slowly, it is showing results because you should not be stunned, you should not be shocked, so that you can see for yourself that what you are and what you are achieving. In Sahaj Yoga, when you enter, you have to know that slowly and steadily But to allow this force within us to you are climbing up a very steep road. Because it has to be very quick, so the rise is very steep and when you are climbing up that rise you have to know, if you don't go further you will slip down, but if you move side ways, you will fall down. You may say that Mother we are moving sideways, so there is a movement. Because of falling grow, first of all we should be very introspective. We should try to see ourselves what is happening to us. We must watch our steps. Are we moving towards our construction or towards our destruction? What are we doing? This EKADASHA RUDRA force, which is within us is so powerful, is so very powerful that, not only in nature but also in human beings, it acts. It acts in a way down also one may feel the movement.

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May-June 2001 13 That is the movement of destruction. So caught into the web of Ekadasha Rudra you must have proper discretion so that they are exposed to people by about yourself. Are we ascending or their misdeeds. That is the advantage, I descending? Are we losing our should say, a part, of the ugly game of steps? Are we going higher in our falsehood. Falsehood always gets steps? Sometimes we do not realise that exposed. You can see writ large on their we are amidst the worst possible faces; Their hypocrisy, their evil negativity in the history of this universe. intentions and their satanic schemes. In the olden times, there would be only As I said that the modern times are one Rakshasa at a time, one had to deal with. It was so easy to deal with one Rakshasa, but to deal with so many of them already needs lot of work. But the the worst for these attacks. We have to be more alert, more aware, more understanding. As the matter is, you all are very well equipped, but we all the time forget that we have got our vibrations, that we have got a new worst part about it is that in the modern times these Rakshasa have entered into the brains of people. Because of their teachings, because of their illusions people have accepted them. And these vibratory awareness. This vibratory people are my children. They are awareness is a kind of a messenger seekers. They are Seekers of Truth. It's which is absolute, which communicates like people using children for a ransom. They put the children before me and I others and what is wrong with us. But if don't know what to do! If I try to kill the you start taking your decisions through devils, then the children are in front. So your mental, emotional enterprises, then which is the best way to destroy, in be sure that you will be misguided, modern times? Of course they can be because all these endeavours are one killed, they can die but how, I am to save awareness of vibrations, we have got and which tells us what is wrong with sided. Like a mental projection goes like the peopie whom they have polluted, whom they have wronged? It is a very- very difficult and very delicate work. For that the only way is to bring them to a point where they get completely exposed. They are debased and the whole world knows who are they, how this in a linear way, falls upon you. And also an emotional one does the same. Even the physical is just the same. But when you start seeing through the vibrations what do you do is to ask your spirit to communicate to you and the spirit is the absolute knowledge. So you do not succumb to your conditioning nor to your ego or to any other training or to any other Guru but yourself. So it is very they look like. So instead of fighting them from outside or just asking Yama to kill them, the best is to make their own being

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May-June 2001 14 important for all of you to understand that we are not going to take any know everything. But those who try to decide things without vibrations can make mistakes, till you reach the stage where you don't have to spread your hands, just you will know, But to go to that stage, you have first to surrender your 'discretion to vibrations. Now some people don't have proper vibrations. May be their Vishudhhis are bad. They should take decision on our mental level but on our vibrations. Many a people think that if I say something about someone, may be, because they have reported it to me. But supposing if I am the source of all the vibrations, what is there for me to get reported? Why should anybody report to me? If they want to report they may but I know what exactly is the situation. Once in Rahuri I was waiting in the guest house and about five six proper care of their Vishudhhis. If they don't have some physical problems on their Vishudhhis they can feel it within professors came on their bikes. They themselves as to what chakras are came and told me, 'Mother we have catching, what is happening to this come to warn you about a particular gentleman? Normally, because we are gentle in the modern times, the people who are gentleman? They gave the name of this possessed appear more beautiful than gentleman. They said you have to be the people who are not possessed. Once very careful, he is a politician. I said alright, that's all you know about him? They said, yes. So you have to be very careful. I said, now I will tell you about man'.I said, who is this we had a lady who came to our programme, she was completely possessed, thin like a beanstalk, absolutely. And everybody, that was the beginning of the Sahaj Yoga, felt that what a beautiful woman has come! I told him that this man has not married his wife. She is the wife of somebody else, and he has eloped with this woman. And the child is his. But this lady was raped them 'keep her out of the hall for the time being'. They could not understand. Then she got cured and she looked very different now. To me she is very by him. That is how he got this child. When I started telling them, they all started raising their eyebrows and beautiful. The beauty that was seen at opening their eyes. They said, 'Mother how do you know? I said you go and find out, whatever I am saying is true or not? They were completely stunned, went back and then reported to me that that time must be the camouflage of the negativity that people saw. Like as you see these Cinema actresses, cinema actors and some of the clowns, who move as Presidents, this that, you can "Mother it is surprising that what you said was the truth'. So on vibrations you can see it writ large on their faces, how horried they are! Unless and until you

Just it happens. I don't say won't be able to make it out. Today what we are doing is to awaken anything of this kind. But the way things within us this Ekadasha Rudra force happen is very surprising. How this which will help you to fight your own negativity and fight the negativity of the significant thing is that this Ekadasha is whole world. Now we have so many going to act only in Kaliyuga, in these hands, so many people with different, modern times. Earlier it was not going to what we call them, Aayudhas, means the weapons. All these weapons are with who is today a guru must have been in a you. They are within you. And you can definitely use them. But first you must know what weapons you are having and how to use them. There is so much blind faith, there are so much of wrong ideas, so much of organisational fortresses they killed the whole thing becomes cleansed have built, all kinds of nonsensical things out. But here they are like mosquitoes, are going on in this world. But they will so many of them, one after another. all be finished. Nobody will know There is no end to it. And they have anything about them except that they entered also into the being of human might know as some villainous creatures beings giving them diseases and all on this earth. Ultimately the living force kinds of problems and tortures. So the will exist. We have to know that we know problem is much more deeper and very the Living Force and we have to be very sure about it and we have to be very Ekadasha is now active! Also the most act because there was hardly one guru, satan last time. Only one horrible Rakshas there. So it was very easy to kill him. To kill Kansa it took no time for Shri Krishna. or to kill Ravana, it took no time for Shri Rama. And once they have very complicated. proud about it that we know what is the Living Force. Then this Ekadasha Rudra within us becomes very strong. say that there are ten forces or Anybody who tries to trouble you will directions, you can say, and this is the have a nice punch.

Because now we have run away from all the villages and we are just residing in that area. If the Sahaj Yogis go through that also the whole night, we will be jumping around. So better ask these three Sahaj Yogis not to come that way, so that at least we have some place to reside. These are, forehead and you get a swelling over here. Some people you must have seen a curve here and a huge big thing coming up. Mostly the cancer patients, if you seen them, they have from left it rises to the right side, quite a lot, a bump there on the right hand side. And there are as I told you, all gone out of the circulation of evolution. So these are some who have got on the left hand side. So from the left hand it rises, goes to the right side and the one which rises from the right side, goes to the left side. So the more dangerous once are which go to the right side, because they are the dead, dead people. And these dead people can, in their subtle bodies, enter into us and form entities. Those entities can grab us and can possess us. Such possessed people look quite normal. As I was saying today, homosexuality, oversexuality, no sexuality, then we ones who are very sly, which we cannot see, which are hiding, which can harm can say, no aesthetics or too much of artistic tendencies; then we can say, you very much. So all these horible things that are too much of eating and hunger or acting today can be completely eating nothing at all, fasting, then not destroyed if we develop our Ekadasha afraid of anyone. What is wrong? For Rudra within ourselves. They are not so everything what is wrong? Not afraid powerful. One Sahaj Yogi can kill thousands of them, while they cannot there are people who feel guilty all harm even one Sahaj Yogi. So they are the time or those who make others feel really powerless before you. They have guilty as if the other person is good for no way of torturing you. In case you are nothing. Plus we have- an other kind a powerful person they will all disappear, who are very very cruel that they can and disappear forever. And remember, enter into people, can make their own once there were three Sahaj Yogis in slaves, can work out anything, horrible India, who used to go by a particular road wars by their own talkings, and their are in a village.

 Message of Sir C.P. Srivastava 18 November 2000, Pratishthan, Pune If we look around us we find that everybody is quarelling in the name of religion, It is happening in India as well as the whole world. Most of the countries in the world are currently facing the problems of division... fighting in the name of religion, racialism, casteism etc. What is this? Are we fighting in the name of God? How many of these know what is God? Every religion has its own definition of God and people of these to the youth to take up the mission of religions fight for what they call their God transformation of society. This is the supreme. Can there be different transformation has to come from inside definitions for one and the only God?

Here we have got employment. We break stones to small never expected that you will come in such a big number and understand the importance of this work. Once we were going for a Sahaj Yoga programme, we were passing through the place known as Daulta Bad. By chance our car developed some problem. It stopped.

There were few clothes hanging and a dilapidated house which could not be called a house. They said we all live in it. Tears rolled down my eyes.

They replied, we are all Muslim ladies, our husbands have divorced us. These condition of our country is so miserable?

I have heard myself saying of, but the simple women are dominoted in every way. No one bothers for them, whatever their condition. If some women dies in young age, the husbands are invited to remarry. I was aghast to see all this because condition of women in Maharashtra is not like this. In Uttar them like this!

If they have so much of money then why do not Goddesses, including, Goddess Laxmi, they construct nice Ashrams for these women. The existing Ashrams, which are distress in our country. If this tendency very few in numbers, are not managed is overcome, then I think all the problems properly. So why not to have such could be solved because the blessing of Ashrams where these women are looked after in a nice way. Fed up from such a the woman. Those who do not respect life, many of them commit suicide. In our taking good care of her, none of the would bless us. This is the cause of all Shri Lakshmi comes when we respect the Gruha Lakshmi, how do they deserve to be benefitted by the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi? I happened to see society it is compulsory for a woman to get married and if the husband dies than there is no end of her miseries. It becomes difficult for her to live. She is a Video Tape in which they showed the widows living in the temples of Vrindavana and Gokul. Poor lord Krishna surrounded by all sorts of troubles. Not that they are immoral. In foreign countries a widowed woman finds out might be concerned with the miserable another husband or takes up some state of these widows! Their condition is so miserable. They are exploited to such an extant that through out the day they are made to sing in the temples and only one Rupee is paid to them every day.The people there misuse them in every way. Even such a film did not prick the conscience of anyone! bussiness. Moral standards in our country are so high that thirty two thousand women oblated themselves to protect their chastity and respect. What is the way then left for the women of this country? They cannot live with respect. Such a miserable state is there thatI think that if at all one gets such disease There, there are five lakh such and live in the hospital, some widows. No one thought that we are arrangement could be made for a earning so much money, why not to do some thing for the benevolence of these women? Why not to start some project for them?

After the death of Ravana, Shri Rama married Mandodari, the wife widows and brought awakening against this custom. They brought many reforms. In Pune, education for women is free of charge. They do not have to pay even a single penny up to graduation. Much reforms are needed in this part of the of Ravana, to Vibhishna. But people say that Shri Rama was alright, yet widows country because condition here is much more miserable. People should be awakened to this problem. On the contrary, if the woman is dominating, she rules the family. Many women have cannot marry. Just imagine your own mother, sister or daughter in such a misrable condition! May God save from such a society! It is better not to have such a society and if at all some society is made everyone should have the right to live peacefully in it. So I would like that learnt to dominate but there is no use of it. Women should absorb every thing because their powers are that of Mother Earth. One should awaken one's powers, all those who have troubled women in the house or outside should transform themselves. They should realise their use them for creative purposes, and live guilt of troubling a poor and helpless with self respect. Mere talking about it will not achieve anything. It should be thoroughly understood that this is a sin woman. Those, who have distressed their wives or daughters are also criminals. I cannot tell what punishment they will be subjected to. Now there will be dawn of Satya Yuga. It is necessary for everyone to adhere to Dharma to the path of righteousness. Essence of and it should not be allowed to happen. Only then there could be transformation in our country. Everyone, whether a Sahaj Yogi or non Sahaj Yogi, has the duty to protect the women being beaten in the neighbourhood. If some drunkard is creating nuisance than he should be checked. It is your social obligation. Until such an awakening takes place in you, this work could not be done. Dharma is love. Those who cannot love their wives, whom else they could love? One who could not love one's daughter how could he love anyone else? Her fault is only this much that she is a woman, Had there been no woman in the world, where would have been your mother and There are some women who are so selfrespecting that they forbear everything. If you tell any widow to get remarried, she will be aghast. We had a how could you take birth? Deep sensitivity towards this fact should arise. Maharashtra was also affected by this evil custom. However great men like Tilak, Gokhle, and Ramdev challenged this custom. They themselves married Sahaj Yogini. She was very beautiful and had three children. Eldest son was 15- 16 years old. Where-ever she went for

Very carefully I asked her that the solution to your problem is Such women could be hot-tempered and quarrel-some. They start politics in the family. Such women could not be that you get remarried. Immediatly she fainted, "Shri Mataji why did you say such a thing? For what fault of mine you ordered this severe punishment?" It is nice. They are always distressed and disturbed. So we have started this organisation on a small level. In it we shall endeavour to train such women so no punishment at all. Such a conditioning in woman is the gift of the society. Once widowed, widowed. You cannot remarry. that they become self sufficient and live with self-respect. If they are young widows then we shall marry them to Nothing doing!

We will be astonished that the whole society could be brought about and helped. Only in our country the institution of family is continuing. In other countries family has broken.

I am telling something new for them. If you are Sahaja Yogis than it should be expressed in your behaviour. Every one should know that you are Sahaj Yogis. We should know that a person is either a Sahaj Yogi or a Non Sahaj Yogi. We should know the art of integrating all. With this Sahaj nature you should conquer the whole world.

The news that we read in papers everyday is because the family system is falling. It must be kept in proper shape. This is the warp and woof of our society.

 Public Programme, Delhi 25 March 2000, Ramlila Ground So far we did not know that we have not yet achieved absolute truth. Commands of intellect, we accepted as Truth. Gradually the brain led us to a state where we started justifing all our deeds. We started running after the material gains. Human connections with truth were severed and human beings fell into the unknown abyss. Now people are surprised as to but comforts remained a mirage and thus how has it happened? Why such a he sank in deep darkness. Man doesn't sitution arose? Why did man shift from know that his deeds are evil and that he wisdom to wickedness? Wickedness has to suffer as a result.

Many such perversions awakened in us. About them, I can only say that there is extreme kaliyuga. There should be some limit of this kaliyuga. the state of humanity. But man was awefully disappointed and fell in to the Even the scriptures have not described that this age is going to be so terrible. Scriptures made just a mention of it.

Thinks that every thing will go on like that. No one has solution for these maladies. In such a state we should remember that saints and seers have asked to been referred to. But the scene before us is horrible and moving. We could only say that human beings failed to have the right path and so went astray. In search of comforts, man ran after the luxuries, "Search within". Solutions to all the problems are within us. Kabir Sahib said, "Kahe Re Ban Khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi, Sada Ananta, Tohe Sang Smai". What

 28 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 are you searching in the forest? The eternal one resides within you, He is always with you. Who is this eternal one went to other countries. I think Machhindra Nath and Gorakh Nath also went to many countries. Bolivian people know about them. They know the names of the chakras and also they know about kundalini. I have seen, in the ancient about which the saints of the world talked? All the Dharmas told about it, Religion was misinterpreted in such a way that it created confusion and people forgot the reality that they have to search with in. Our soul resides within us. It is paintings of the Russia, they have painted plexuses. If you travel a little in this country then you will be surprised that how and from where have they known about it! Decidedly some of our saints might have gone there and told about every thing. In India also they told fully alive in every being. This Atma is the reflection of the Almighty God (RHI) in our heart. All the saints talked about it. But people say that, 'Mother we have not known any such thing'. Now the time has come for you to know about and wrote about Kundalini, that it resides within you. Nath Panthis avoided to tell about it because they were afraid of this power being misused by the people. Many, so called saints who read about it have spread misconceptions about it and made it a source of making money. Our ancient saints might have thought that the awakening is not meant for ordinary people. In twelfth century, saint Gyaneshwara sought permission from your soul and how to experience it. The 'Atma' with in us is witnessing everything. We have neglected it to such an extent that now it does not warn us against our misdeeds. We have changed our wisdom into wickedness and are unable to see our misdeeds. We go on committing all sorts of wrong things and justify ourselves. That is how the sense of discretion (เคธเคคเฅ เคธเคคเฅ เคตเคฟเคตเฅเค เคฌเฅเคฆเฅเคงเคฟ) becomes inoperative. his Guru to write about Kundalini in his book - Gyaneshwari.

Do not read it, it is useless, it is not meant for ordinary people. Recently I have heard a lecture of a renowned Babaji. He said, that you achieve the spirit. For this, arrangement has been made in our body. We need not search it outside. Kundalini, the sacred power is placed in your triangular bone called Sacrum.

One realises one's foolishness. What was I fighting about? Without knowing yourself, you can not Those people who have become Sahaj Yogis in our country, they have become prosperous. Their behaviour has improved and all disputes finished. Because this power is all pervading, know the truth. But people are wasting their lives, and lives of their children. The whole country will be destroyed. Many countries are being destroyed. So we have to awaken our Kundalini. It is very moves every where. It works out everything, and our lives become ideal, so ideal that people say, "what a man sacred. This Kundalini is your individual Mother. She is your own Mother.

There cremate or bury the dead body. Such letters were sent to me that I was of the people and kundalini awakening is no other way out.

He loved people so much that they sent so many letters and faxes, to give a little of your time. Go to which I have not been able to go through meditation centres and attain more so far. So much of love, so much of depth. People do not grow because beautiful things people wrote that I am the fire. Just get connected. You have they do not go to collectivity. Without nourishing it with collective love this plant will not grow. That is the reason Jesus Christ said, that some seeds fell on stone or in such places that they were surprised, I never thought that people loved him so much. The atmosphere of love you have entered. Every one will love you and you will also love everyone. The biggest quality of Sahaj Yoga is the Power of Love. No other power could stand before it. You are in the protection trees. Sahaj Yoga neither condemns nor of this Power of Love. You are always opposes any religion. Incorporation of protected. No one can touch you the quintessence of all the religion in it, because God loves you. Who dares to is its speciality. The deep relations which destroyed but those seeds which fell in the fertile land, sprouted and became go against Him? Who could be hostile to Him? We have many examples where people say, "how have I changed, I do not know. How have I achieved, I do not know". You feel happy when you listen are there in these religions will get established. A life full of joy and comforts is waiting for you. May you achieve it. This is my blessing to you all.

 SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION 14 September 1990, Hammersmith Town Hall, England Now please put So now, you will have to close your your left hand towards me and the Before eyes. closing the eyes you can take out the spectacles but please don't open right hand on your heart and please close your eyes.

It's very simple. out. are your own Master. So please take your hand on to the left side of your body in the upper partion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here ask another fundamental question three times. "Mother, am I my own master? Ask the question please ask three times. So, what I have to ask you is that you are entering into the kingdom.of God and you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. First of all, forgive your- self. Dont say it is difficult, it is the easiest thing to say. Just forgive yourself and don't feel guilty. Actually forget the past I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge on you. I cannot because it's finished and the future force. So, now take your hand down to the lower portion of your abdomen and ask six times a question or you have to request six times because this centre has got six petals, "Mother, please give me doesn't exist. You have to be in the present. So just forget about it. Some people might be feeling guilty, why I read this book, why I read that book? Forget it, done is done finished, so have confidence, alright? pure knowledge". Six times, ask, this centre has got six petals. AS soon as you

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 35 have asked for pure knowledge the kundalini has started moving up, you may not feel it but it is moving. So now we have to nourish our upper centres with our confidence to open them out. I have already told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play into the hands of wrong people and you torture yourself. So you have to forgive everyone, in general. So raise your right hand on to your forehead and So now, raise your right hand on to the upper portion of the abdomen of the left hand side, press it hard and here you have to say with full confidence "Mother, put your small finger and thumb on to temples and three fingers on your head and put down your head. This is the I am my own master"? Just say it with control of sympathetic and para- sympathetic. Now, put down your head, put down fully. Now here please say it is very important. If you don't forgive I can't full confidence ten times because this centre has got ten petals. Now, raise your right hand on to the forgive for you. You won't get your heart where resides the Spirit. I have realisation because this centre is a already told you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this conditioning nor your ego but you centre which is very very tight one. So you have to forgive everyone, in general, just say that, just say that "Mother,I are the spirit, pure spirit. So, now raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence twelve times "Mother, forgive everyone" in your heart say it, in your heart not how many times; from your heart say it, from your heart, not how many times, that's not important. I am the spirit". Twelve times, "Mother, I am the spirit", which you are. I have already told you about this Divine Power and this Divine power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion, is the ocean of blessings but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might commit, the power of this ocean of forgiveness can dissolve Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head, push back your head fully as far as possible, hold it. Now here, you have to say for your own satisfaction without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes you have to just say "O Divine power of love, if I have all that. done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." "O! Divine power if I have done any mistakes knowingly or committed any wrongs knowingly or unknowingly please forgive So now, raise your right hand into the corner of your neck and your shoulder as far back as possible, press it hard and push your head to your right fully. Now here you have to say with full confidence in yourself "Mother, I am not guilty at all." me". You say it from your heart, not how many times, but from your heart.

 May-June 2001 36 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 do some introspection and some soul- searching, and we have to find out after all why! Why we human beings have created all these problems for ourselves. We have had philosophies, we had as much as you can. Push back your ideologies, we had so many kinds of fingers as much as you can please push enterprises but despite that there are so many differences, and the differences are having larger and larger gaps. If it is the Truth, it has to be the Truth for Now, please stretch your hand or stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now, please bend your head back your fingers, put a good pressure on your fontanelle bone area. And now again I have to tell you, I respect your everyone, everyone has to say this is the Truth, but it has to be the Absolute Truth. If it is not the Absolute Truth then what we believe into is not the reality and this is the main reason why everything in the name of God, Divinity, everything has failed so far because it is not substantiated by reality. freedom, I cannot force Self-Realisation on you. So you have to ask for it in your freedom. So now, move your scalp seven times slowly, seven times slowly clockwise saying "Mother, please give me my self realisation". Now please take down your hands, slowly open your eyes, you can wear your spectacles. Put your hands up like that, watch me. Can you do it without thinking? Watch Me. First we must feel the reality and what is the reality and what is the Truth? The Truth is that you are the Spirit, you are May God bless you. the pure Spirit and that there is all the very outset we have to know that pervading power of Divine Love which does all living work. Now we see all these beautiful flowers, beautifully arranged, I bow to all the seekers of Truth. At truth is what it is. We cannot organise it, we cannot mould it, also we cannot know it at the stage when we are human beings, with human awareness we cannot know it. So we have to become everything, but we never think how so many flowers have come out of one seed? How it has worked? This living work is done by whom? We will say the Mother Earth but Mother Earth seems a super human being, a higher personality. What is said that you have to be the spirit, you have to be the Self. In all the scriptures, in all the religions, it has been said that you have to be the spirit and when we see the turmoil and the problmes in the world, completely to be a thing which is just a matter. Then how these flowers have sprouted from a little seed? Who has done this work? We don't even think who has done the job of making us human beings from amoeba stage! So, for a hypothesis, let us think there is something, some power, that is doing it. As scientist you must keep your show us that there is so much of a mess. And most of them are the problems created by human beings. We have to

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 37 dangerous and this brings problems. Not at all. This Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils, is an energy of pure minds open; there's no use having blind faith in me, in Sahaj Yoga, in anything. Because blindness will never give you desire within you. All other desires rise reality. You should be open like scientists are, and whatever hypothesis I am putting before you, you have to feel it on your Central Nervous System. This is what is the Bodha, is what is Buddha within us and once we achieve them we still are not satisfied, we are going from one desire to another. So, the law of economics says that, 'in general desires are not satiable'. So this is the only power which has to rise and give us that Pure preached about that you have to feel the All Pervading Power on your Central Nervous System, and the time has come, time has come for all of you to feel that. You all can feel that All-Pervading Power, the power of the Holy Ghost, the power of the Primordial Mother and then once Desire that once we achieve it or once we manifest it, then all the desires become absolutely of no value. Then this madness of desire goes away and we understand all these transitory things, all these pleasures of life with its full limitations and we know how far to go you are in connection with that-like this instrument, when it is connected to mains it has a meaning. Your self knowledge will tell you what is the meaning of your life, otherwise there is no meaning. We are without any connections to the reality and that's why we do not know where are we drifting? What is happening to us? Where are we going? with them. But first we must seek the eternal, we must seek this All Pervading Power which is very subtle and is ail around us. But as human beings are, as you must have seen here also, on top of your head, here, on one side it is the Yellow Ego, on the left side is your Superego, is your conditionings. We have so many conditionings in our minds, to say that I am Indian, you are a British Now, I verily say to you that within us lies this instrument, and this instrument is very well intact in all of you. Now there are some people who have written books after books, which have really shocked me, saying that it is very dangerous to raise the Kundalini, some people have said that Kundalini is in the stomach. So or you are this and you are that is a conditioning. God never created world like that, He created only one world, we have made it like this. This is the one world, this is another world, this is the another nation. We human beings have created problems for us. Of course, I mean He did create rivers and mountains they are unauthorised people or perhaps they do not want you to have your Self Knowledge. They want to deviate you. Also, you will find people who will tell you that you should not do this Kundalini and he did create different type of people, otherwise you all would have looked like some military junta. But no, He made us differently to look different. That was His Awakening and all that because it is very

 The Divine Cool Breeze Volume-XIII Issue 5 & 6 May - June 2001 38 conditionings that are within us are built in and then also this Ego that has come into us that I am doing this work, I am doing that work. Now, see we have a beautiful Hall of course to be appreciated very much and we should say that it is a very good piece of art or whatever it is. But something like a tree was dead so we have made this platform, from dead to dead. We have done no living work, whatsoever. We cannot do it, but when idea to create beauty, while we have such conditionings! From the very childhood we have conditionings of this kind! Then we think we are born in a particular religion. So that is one another horrible conditioning we have that we are in this religion so we must follow this religion. But in Sahaj Yoga when you come, you will be amazed to see that those people who started all these religions are the real people and once they started it, after some time it drifted the kundalini rises. you will be surprised, into something extremely nonsensical. in many people who have problem, on Now running away from the religion also their centres, you can see with naked eyes the pulsation. Under your hand you towards it just the same. So, what is that can see the pulsation of kundalini rising you have to go beyond all these and you can feel the pulsation on top of your head, here, and when the pulsation disappears you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, out of your own head. All these things are to be verified. There cannot be pretentions about it. Reality stands by itself, it does so many people who say that 'Mother, not need any support. So, when all this happens to you, what you get is the Self Self you cannot solve the problem or running conditionings that are there and also beyond your Ego. Now the ideas about Ego are also prevalent and people say that these are our Karmas, we must suffer. I know of what about karmas'? Now, the yellow stuff that you see there is the Ego. It is only the human beings who think that they have done some bad karmas or good karmas. Animals don't think. They are under the complete control of God, that's why they are called as Pashus, means Pash, completely controlled. A dog is a dog, a scorpion is a scorpion, a tiger is a tiger. They behave the way they are, but human beings have everything in them. You may find somebody as a Knowledge. What is the Knowledge? It is, first of all, to know about your own centres. Now a person gets lunatic without knowing that he is getting lunatic, a person gets cancer without knowing that he is getting cancer. Whatever happens to you, you just do not know as to what is happening to you. You have to go to doctors, spend lot of money, do everything and then the doctor certifies, now you have these ten diseases in you and that now you will die after one month or so.

Just to certify yourself that we are 'twice born people' or we are this and people getting realisation! I was amazed this is misleading yourself. You have not been kind to yourself, I should say, and laughing, I have never seen French not honest to yourself. You have to be Kundalini who is your Mother. She doesn't trouble you. When you were all the labour pains upon herself. She didn't trouble you. In the same way this the way these days the Kundalini is realisation but in a place like Paris, where I never had such hopes, thousands of that time and all of them full of joy. women laughing that much.

Supposing, this room is completely dark. We don't know how we relate to each other, where we are sitting. If we start walking we might tumble over other people, we may try to trample some poeple but if there is light, you see, you know where you are sitting, where others are sitting, what is your chair, what is their chair. So, in that light of Spirit have now commercialised all these ideas, we are just getting lost into it. So, we have to do little bit soul-searching and find out, where am 1?
