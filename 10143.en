Easter Puja in a house in Pratishthan, (India) April 12th, 2006

Shri Mataji: A very important thing.
[Sound is very bad; Shri Mataji is knocking at the mic]
Hello
Sahaja Yogis: Hello Shri Mataji
Shri Mataji: Better? 
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

I’m saying today is very important. This is a new starting for you all. Try to understand that you’ve worked very hard so far, and you wanted to do much more than you have been able to do. That was your desire and it will work out, definitely it will work out. If your desire is strong, things will work out and you’ll get a great chance of helping people as you have helped yourself and you’re happy about it. It’s better that you desire to help others, it’s important they all should be blessed. 
You can do it, there lies your leadership, that you have to give it to others. Most of you have got it, for inner sight, but you have to give it to others. Let the others also gain in their spirituality. 

And you also, so many of you got your Realization and you are so much in it and you are all very happy. 
So be happy and cheerful!
That is the first time that you are here and you have got the Realization. With this Realization, you can give Realization to others.

The speciality of today is that Christ came back to life just to do something for us. So it’s a very important day for all of us. I would say that you today you should understand that you’ve got all this power to give Realization to others. You have got it but now you have to use [it]. Those who have Self Realization should not waste their energy but try to give it. This world is full of chaos and quarrels and fighting still going on. So you have a duty and a job with me, to talk to them and tell them that first important thing, Sahaja Yogis must become peaceful and they must enjoy the roots of Sahaja Yoga. I’m sure everything will work out; it has worked out with so many of you and it will work out with others. 

It’s not just a talk but it is something happening. So try to remember that you are all Sahaja Yogis and you deserve a very good help, very good help from me and from God Almighty.
There is nothing to be upset, these are all different tests which we can count the goodness in me, I can guess the results, you’ll find Sahaja Yogis, special ones.

It’s very nice to see so many of you who tried to get Realization but who are really already Realized. There are many who want to have Realization but there are already many who are already Realized and who can do a lot for others who want their help. 

Today is a good day where you have to decide for your future. You have to decide what you all can do to help other Sahaja Yogis to get more Sahaja Yogis. We have to spread Sahaja Yoga, you see, so many problems are there. And the more we have Sahaja Yogis, there’s no problem left which you all solved. 7:58
So I wish you luck that these- try to get your Realization proper and confirmed. 

I hope you don’t have doubts about it. If you have any doubts, you can write to me.

Now we have got some very nice, good people, who have come to Sahaja Yoga. 
So it is to everybody to see that they become good Sahaja Yogis and they enjoy the blessings 
I’m very happy to see so many of you coming. And today’s date is a very good day also. 
In the life of Christ a very great thing happened, that he became - he became or he was already a sahaja yogi
And He tried to make many Sahaja Yogis where possible. 
But at that time people were not so alert as you are. You all are special people who are seeking and who have found out and you can give it to others. This is not for keeping with yourself. If you have got it, just don’t think that you have got the last chance but give chance to others.
I’m all with you, anyone of you, have any personal or any other problem, you should write to me. 
I’m sorry I won’t be able to go, give anything for this special day.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
