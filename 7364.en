In the medical studies whatever we have discovered so far is available there already. Whatever we can discover with human awareness has its own limitations. Supposing it is said that the human body does not accept any foreign thing into its body, but when the foetus is implanted, it is not thrown out but looked after and thrown out at the right time. Also the adreline and acetocholine on our body, its mode of action cannot be explained because sometimes they augment and sometimes they relax. We cannot explain so many things through medical achievements. Much has to be known and much to be found out.
I would like you all to know something of the beyond which is not known so far. So have an open mind of a scientist to see for yourself if its true or not. Till then it is like a hypothesis. Sahaja Yoga gives you the complete picture of the totality of consciousness. As you grow higher and higher in Sahaja Yoga you yourself understand and can work out this great system. First we have to accept that we are not only this human body, nor are we emotions, neither are we ego and conditionings, but we are the Pure Spirit. There is an all pervading power of Love which does all this living work of creating flowers, fruits, and making us human beings. In science they do not talk of love but even the doctors have love for the patients otherwise they cannot dedicate.
First the doctor has to become the Spirit. He has to feel the cool vibrations on his head which are the fruit of this all pervading power of Love. This is the instrument which you have to use, first of all for cleansing yourself and for cleansing others. In the medical science we can say that the parasympathetic system is looked after by the central channel and the left and right is looked after by two more channels. According to Sahaja Yoga, left and right sympathetic are two separate energies. The left one is the one which comforts us, the right one is the one which counsels us and the center one is the one which redeems us. All this happens after realization, because you have to have the correction.
In human beings, the centers are in the spinal cord and also in the brain. They are formed from the left and the right, and both put together is the central system. The triangular bone in which the Kundalini resides is called as Sacrum. Sacrum means sacred and the Greeks knew about it and put that word in the medical terminology. According to Sahaja Yoga we are basically three types of people. Firstly we either go to the left or to the right. Left side is our desires and also whatever doesn't work out goes into our collective subconscious. We can say it looks after our psyche. It starts from down below at first center and goes upward and crosses over at the optic chiasma and creates the super-ego in psychological terms is the conditioning. The lower center also nourishes the pelvic plexus. This is responsible for our excretion and sex. So one has to have sane ideas about sex because this channel originates from the last center. When Freud talked of psyche he perverted the whole thing. Instead of telling people how to safeguard this center which is the center of innocence by looking after the sex habits, he just told the other way round. He related everything to sex as if human beings are just sex points. He formed a self-opiniated ideology that every man has sex feelings for his mother. On this mental projection he based all his theories and people thought it was so-called ‘freedom’ to have sex the way they like. They didn't even challenge him. He became more than Christ to them in the West. As a result we have now the disease like AIDS, gnnorhrea, syphilis, etc. All related to sex organs. It was always called private parts but it was never understood what it means.
Left side is the phychic problem and the right side is the psychosomatic problems. Psychosomatic problems are when you work too hard and think too much. In the second center all the energy goes to the brain which thinks too much and is futuristic. Right sided problems are caused by over active liver or one gets diabetes because pancreas it not looked after. You get leukemia because spleen is not looked after. You get high blood pressure because kidneys are in trouble. As the heat of the liver ascends you get asthma. The brain is like a spongy matter and it coagulates. So the heat goes to kidneys. They cannot pass urine and the urine circulates in the body and blood. Also it causes constipation. Heat is the symptom of disease and coolness is the symptom of good health. The experiment with helium gas showed that when given heat, all the molecules were fighting with each other. And when they removed the heat they found all the molecules were united.
The third type of diseases are psychosomatic. Those who are psychosomatic have more problem with the psyche than with the physical. Cancer is psychosomatic. All viruses are dead plants or dead animals, maybe microscopic, which have gone out of circulation of evolution. They reside in the area called collective sub-conscious. Doctors have reached a certain understanding that they say that this cancer is caused to a person when he goes into a shock and the attack comes from the left in the area which was built within us since the creation. This is the same area as the collective sub-conscious where everything that is dead is there. So there are humans who are dead hanging around there.
In physical science you may have never heard of something. There is a soul which is playing on the causal of all elements. It is attached in loops on the back side of our body. In all the seven centers plus the Sacrum bone it resides. It makes seven loops. After realization you can see many loops like going round and round like chakras and one into another: sometimes many into it together, and sometimes only one. Also you can see little sparks like commas, which is chaitanya of the vibrations. These are the dead souls. Now this soul is reflected on ourselves in the receptor area. Recently in America they have taken photographs of the receptor of a cell. It looks exactly like what you see after realization. But when another soul sits on the being then it is reflected on the cells. It affects the receptor also. This new soul might get attached to anyone of the centers or to all of them. It affects the cells also and they give all this depomine series which causes epilepsy, mental problems, cancer, etc. If they are viruses its not so bad. Only one may go in and affect but it can travel from one to another. If its a human possession then it's very difficult.
Hypertension, Heart disease, epilepsy come from the left side. Migraine or sick headache could be from both sides. All bone diseases are psychosomatic. Leukemia, Tumors, Fibrosis is psychosomatic. Menopause is not a disease. Its a normal condition. Inflammation of the pancreas could be also psychosomatic. Sciatica could be somatic or psychosomatic. All mental diseases are left sided. Schizophrenia is left sided. Alcoholism starts in the right side and creates left sided problems. Arthritis is psychosomatic. Drug addiction, smoking, homo sexuality and perverted sex, too much indulgence in sex is all left sided or psychosomatic.
Smoking creates left-sided problems because one feels guilty. Perverted sex habits and flirting of the eyes, AIDS, too much sex, or rigidity is due to left side. It is some sort of a possession. Multiple sclerosis is center problem. Neurosis could be from both sides. Parkinson's disease is left side. Rhematicism comes from the Nabhi. Muscular distrophy comes from the left side. Yuppie's disease is where you are extremely hard working, very futuristic and use your conscious mind too much. Studying too much. Then the conscious mind becomes absolutely paralyzed. You are walking alright and suddenly you are conscious that you are walking then you will suddenly fall down. I had told eight years back in America that it will come. I told them about AIDS about fourteen years back. But nobody listened. Now it's very serious.
Diabetes is mostly right-sided. When you use too much of right then the exhaustion takes place here. So you are vulnerable and suddenly happens from the left side, as the connection with the whole is lost. These proteins like 53, 58 are very ego-oriented and arbitrary. Whatever cell they touch, that becomes malignant. Thus malignancy sets in. So women suffer from breast cancer. The center of the heart is the Mother's center. When the motherhood of a woman is challenged, say the husband is a flirt and keeps her insecure, or if she's insecure then this center gets affected. This center produces antibodies to fight the diseases in the sternum bone till the age of twelve years. Then they are distributed all over. Whenever there is fear the sternum bone shakes and it is like a remote control that sends messages to all the antibodies to fight. If you establish the security of such a lady through Kundalini awakening then her cancer can be cured. When they are in very advance stages they do not have that will- power left. Then it's better to remove the breast and then establish your security.
There are diseases which are caused by the lethargic organs. When heart is lethargic one gets angina. When the left vishuddhi catches you feel very guilty and then there's a block and the blood cannot flow to the head, then it has to go to the heart and such a heart becomes tired and lethargic. In Sahaja Yoga we have two types of organs: one is lethargic and the other is over active.
The doctors should first of all establish themselves properly and protect themselves, then they can learn to cure others. Use the photographs which have the vibrations in them. Psychosomatic must be dealt only first on the left side. Some children suffer from hyper activity. Diabetes also comes from the same reason. At the time when the mother is pregnant she should not work very hard. She should take rest more. She should not think too much but read something soothing, something nice. Best is to meditate. At that time if the mother is over-active and thinking if futuristic things, children are born with diseases. Or if she's hectic the child may get leukemia. The spleen is for all emergencies because it produces red blood corpuscles. But if you are hectic, panicked all the time, rushing about then the poor spleen cannot understand. It becomes erratic and crazy. It could happen to children or adults.
When something triggers from the left side and there's sudden shock, may be sadness, accident anything, it triggers leukemia. The worst thing which is very difficult for anyone to understand is that there are negative forces working. They work through negativity. They work through some false guru, or parapsychology or mesmerism, etc. All these things are done by putting some sort of a dead soul on your soul. One has to be very clear. For this you cannot charge money. It is a living process. For example you sow a seed. You don't pay money to Mother Earth. She does it. It is built in the seed as well as Mother Earth. We also take all the living processes for granted. There's no obligation. But all these horrible people are money-oriented. They have no purity of heart or purity of eyes. They are interested in women, men or all kinds of dirty things. They are not able to explain how they do it. They cannot relate it to medical science or any science.
In Sahaja Yoga we do some Hatha Yoga exercises whenever necessary. When there is a chakra damaged because of some physical problem, we try to give that particular Hatha Yoga exercise. But the way people to Hatha Yoga is to take all the medicines at once. In Hatha -- Ha and Tha both the Nadis have to be used. But nowadays its only Ha used. This can cause a great imbalance within you. People who do this can become extremely dry, hot tempered and may divorce his wife or leave his children.
We should be in the center and Kundalini should be fixed permanently with that All Pervading Power and flow all the time within you. But apart from physical, mental and emotional life, you have the Spiritual life, which is much more miraculous, which is very blissful and when you understand how this power of Love looks after everything, you are amazed
