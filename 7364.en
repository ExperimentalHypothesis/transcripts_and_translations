Doctor’s Conference, 2 July 1990 – Moscow (Russia)

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

In the medical studies whatever we have discovered so far is there already available. And whatever we can discover with human awareness has its own limitations.

Supposing it is said that the human body does not accept any foreign thing into its being, but when the foetus is implanted, then it is looked after, it's not thrown out, it's looked after and thrown out at the right time.

Also the role of acetylcholine and adrenaline in our body, its mode of action cannot be explained because sometimes they augment, sometimes they relax. We cannot even explain the action of our spleen; there are so many things that cannot be explained through medical achievements. So we have to know there is much to be known and much to be found out.

So I would like you all to know something of the beyond which is not known so far. And for you I would request to have an open mind of a scientist to see for youself if it is true or not. Till then it's like a hypothesis.

So Sahaja Yoga gives you the complete picture, total picture, of the totality of consciousness. And as you grow higher and higher in Sahaja Yoga you yourself understand and can work out this great system.

First we have to accept that we are not only this human body, nor our emotions, and neither our ego and conditionings, but we are the Spirit, the pure Spirit. The another thing one has to understand, that there is an all-pervading Power of Love which does all this living work of creating flowers, creating fruits, making us human beings.

Of course in the science there is no place for love as such, it doesn't talk of love. But even the doctors have to love the patients otherwise they cannot dedicate.

So first the doctor has to become the Spirit and has to feel the cool vibrations around him, which are the proof of this all-pervading Power of Love. Now this is the instrument which you have to use, first of all for cleansing yourself and for cleansing others.

In the medical terminology we can say that the parasympathetic nervous system is looked after by the central channel and the left and right is looked after by two more channels.

According to Sahaja Yoga left and right sympathetic are two separate energies. The left one is the one which comforts us, the right one is the one which counsels us and the centre one is the one which redeems us. So all this is after Realization, because you have to have the connection.

Now in human beings these centres are in the spinal cord and also in the brain. And they are formed like this, from the left and from the right, both put together is the central system.

The triangular bone in which this Kundalini resides is called as Sacrum as you know. ‘Sacrum’ means ‘sacred’ so the Greeks knew about it and they put that word in the medical terminology also, ‘sacred’.

So according to Sahaja Yoga we are actually basically three types of people. Firstly, either we go to the left or to the right.

Left side is our desires that have worked out and also whatever doesn’t work out goes into our subconscious on the left side, and then into collective subconscious. We can say that it looks after our psyche. It starts from down below there, from the last centre, goes upward, crosses over at the optic chiasma and creates what you call as the superego in the psychological terms, means the conditioning. The lowest centre also nourishes the pelvic plexus, which is responsible for our excretion. Also it looks after sex.

So one has to have sane ideas about sex because this channel originates from the last centre.

But when Freud talked of psyche, he perverted the whole thing. Instead of telling people how to safeguard this centre, how to safeguard the centre of innocence by looking after the sex habits, he just told the other way round. He related everything to sex as if human beings are just sex points. And he formed a very funny self-opiniated ideology that every man has sex feelings for his mother. Horrible! On this mental projection he based all his theories and people thought it was so-called ‘freedom’ to have sex the way they like. They didn’t even challenge him. He became more than Christ to them in the West.

As a result we have now the invasion of AIDS, we have got all kinds of these diseases like gonorrhoea and all these serious diseases, which are, they say so, at least 60 percent in America. All related to sex organs. It was always called as 'private', ‘private parts’, but it was never understood what does it mean.

Now so the left side is the psychic problem and the right side is the physical problems, somatic problems.

Now the somatic problems are when we work too hard and think too much, we are futuristic, then we start using this centre, the second centre. When we think too much, then we have to supply energy for the brain. So all the energy of this centre goes to such a brain which thinks too much, which is futuristic. And other important functions it has to do, which are neglected.

So the right-sided problems are caused by, neglect by liver, overactive liver. You get diabetes because pancreas is not looked after. You get leukemia because spleen is not looked after. You get high blood pressure because kidneys are in trouble. As the heat of the liver ascends you get asthma. We all know that the brain is like a spongy matter and in a way coagulates. Same thing happens to kidneys when the heat goes to the kidneys. They cannot pass the urine, the urine circulates in the body and in the blood. Also it causes constipation.

So heat is the symptom of disease and coolness is the symptom of benevolence. So they have experimented with helium gas and when they gave heat to helium they found out that all the molecules were fighting with each other. And when they cooled it, then they found all the molecules were collective.

Now the third type of diseases are psychosomatic, combination of both. But those who are psychosomatic they have more problems with the psyche than with the physical.

I'll explain to you about cancer, which is psychosomatic according to us. All these viruses are the dead plants or dead animals, maybe microscopic, which have gone out of the circulation of evolution. They reside in the area which we call as collective subconscious.

Doctors have reached the certain understanding about it, little certain understanding, that they say there are proteins 53 and 58, which trigger the cancer. Also they say that this cancer is caused to a person when he goes into some sort of a shock or something and this attack comes from, triggering comes from the area which was built within us since our creation. This is the same area, which I'm telling you, is the collective subconscious where everything that is dead is there. So there are people, also human beings who are dead, are hanging round there, dead souls.

Now if I tell you something which you may not have heard with medical science, but I'll give you the complete picture in any case to understand.

There is the soul which is made of causal of all the elements, which is attached in loops on the back side of our body, in all the seven centres plus the Sacrum bone where it resides. It makes seven loops.

I have told them, because after Realization you can see many loops like that, round round things in loop, you see them like chakras and one into another, many of them, sometimes together, sometimes only one. Also you can see little sparks like commas, that is the Chaitanya, that is the vibrations. Now I have told them that these are the dead souls hanging around.

Now this soul is reflected on our cells in the receptor area. Recently, very recently in America they have now pictured the receptor of a cell. It exactly looks like the one you see after Realization in the air, exactly. But when another soul sits on the being then it is reflected on the cells. Dead soul, another dead soul. It affects the soul, it affects them because it is reflected in the cell, it is also affects the receptor. Then this soul, new soul, which is there, it might get attached to anyone of the centres or to all of them depends on affects the cells also. And they create all this dopamine series which causes epilepsy, mental problems, also cancer, also AIDS, also all these things.

So if they are viruses, then it’s not so bad, I mean only one portion can be affected, but it can travel from one to another. But if it’s a human possession then it’s very difficult.

So now in Sahaja Yoga to cure the diseases which you are giving me here, out of which I'll give it out to you is:

hypertension can be caused both of them, heart disease could be also from the same. Epilepsy definitely from the left side. Migraine or sick headaches could be from both sides. All these bone diseases... Is this like, what you call, arthritis? It is this also is psychosomatic. Leukemia is definitely psychosomatic, tumours are psychosomatic, women diseases, fibrosis, menopause... menopause is not a disease, it’s a normal thing. Inflammation of the pancreas could be also psychosomatic. Cholecystitis need not be, need not be, it is, it can be somatic also. No, actually cholecystitis is left-sided, is left-sided, sorry. Sciatica could be both, could be psychosomatic, could be somatic. All mental diseases — left-sided, absolutely. Schizophrenia — absolutely. Alcoholism is created by right side, creating left side problems. Arthritis — psychosomatic. Varicosity is right-sided. Now bad habits, like drug addiction, smoking, homo sexuality and all kind of perverted sex, too much indulgence into sex is all due to psychosomatic, or left-sided, absolutely left-sided.

See, drug addiction, smoking... smoking creates left side problem because one feels guilty. But we can say, perverted sex habits and flirting of the eyes, and AIDS, and what you call, too much of sex, or rigidity, and also interest in, I've said, perverted sex you call that, all this is due to the left side, is some sort of a possession. Infantile paralysis is left-sided, same thing, multiple sclerosis absolutely this left, this centre. We cured the other day one lady of multiple sclerosis in about ten minutes and she started walking so fast. Then, what is there, neurosis — neurosis could be from both the sides [UNCLEAR]. Parkinson’s also from the same, left side. Rheumatism is the Nabhi, left side. Muscular dystrophy also left side. Stroke could be depends on: if it is on the left-hand side, then it is from the somatic side; if it is on the right-hand side, then it is from the left side. Then there is yuppie’s disease — yuppie’s disease is where you are very hard working, you are extremely futuristic and use your conscious mind too much, studying too much also. Then the conscious mind becomes absolutely paralyzed. You are walking all right and suddenly you are conscious that you are walking — you just paralyzed. I had told about yuppie’s disease about eight years back in America, that it will come. But they didn't listen to Me. Now it is a very, very serious disease, very serious and it's fast spreading, very fast spreading. I told them about AIDS about I think fourteen years back. They laughed at Me. Now they are in it.

Diabetes is partly, very partly we should say left, but mostly right.

Cancer is, any cancer is like this: you see, this is the centre and centre is giving energy on both the sides. And when you move one too much, because of using left or right, specially right, when you use too much of right, the exhaustion takes place [UNCLEAR]. So you are vulnerable. And suddenly happens from the left side, it breaks. And the connection with the whole is lost. So these proteins, like 53, 58, they are very ego-oriented and arbitrary. Whatever cell they touch, that becomes malignant. Thus, malignancy is set in.

Same women suffer from breast cancer. The centre of heart is the Mother’s centre. When the motherhood is challenged of a woman, supposing the husband has flirt and he keeps her always insecure, or she’s very much sort of insecure otherwise also then this centre gets tarnished. Now this centre produces antibodies to fight the diseases in the sternum bone as you all know till the age of twelve years. And then they are distributed all over. So whenever there is any fear the sternum bone shakes and it's like a remote control and sends messages to all the antibodies to fight. So if you can establish the security of such a lady through Kundalini awakening, nourishing her centre here, her cancer can be cured. When they are in very advance stages, they do not have that will-power left. Then it’s better to remove the breast and then establish your security.

Already there are diseases also which are caused by the lethargic organs.

When heart is lethargic you get angina. When this centre of Vishuddhi catches on the left side here, when you feel guilty, then the blood cannot flow to the head, then it has to work very hard and such a heart becomes tired and lethargic.

So in Sahaja Yoga we have two types of organs: one are overactive and one are lethargic.

It's lucky that the photograph also have vibrations. So the doctors should first of all establish themselves properly, cleanse themselves nicely and protect themselves, then they can also learn how to cure others.

But in the beginning, you can use the photographs and with the photographs how to cure you can find out from the centres, for every, left side or right side, there are only three types: left side, right side or psychosomatic.

But as I told you, that psychosomatic is first has to be dealt only on the left side.

I think I've dealt with many diseases and if you have any other problems you should let me know what is to be done. There is one more, I must say, that I've seen some children suffering from hyperactivity. Even diabetes comes from the same reason of a children. Children get diabetes with the same disease of which I'm telling. At the time when the mother is pregnant, she should not work very hard. She should take rest more. She should not think too much but read something soothing things, something nice. Best is to meditate.

At that time if mother is overactive and thinking of the futuristic things, children are born with these diseases. And if she’s hectic, the child may get leukemia because you know spleen will use for all emergencies, because it produces red blood corpuscles. But you are hectic, panicked all the time, rushing about, then poor spleen doesn't understand. It becomes erratic and also it becomes crazy I must say. This could be for even grownups, same thing. This is also for the grownups.

Now when suddenly something triggers from the left side as a shock maybe, as some sort of a sadness, maybe accident, anything, it triggers leukemia, as well as in the children.

But the worst thing that is very difficult for anybody to understand is there are negative forces working. They work through negative people. These can come as false gurus or some parapsychology or mesmerism, anything like that. All these things are done through putting some sort of a dead soul on your soul. So one has to be very careful.

For this you cannot charge money because it's a living process of evolution.

Anything living: for example, you sow the seed — you don’t pay any money to Mother Earth, she does it. It is built in the seed as well as the Mother Earth. You don't pay anything. We also take all the living processes for granted without thinking about it. There’s no obligation.

But all these horrible people are money-oriented. They have no purity of heart, purity of eyes. They are interested in women or men, all kinds of thing, dirty things they do. The most important thing they cannot explain how they do it. They cannot relate it to medical science or to any science.

Now there are some people who are trying to market, marketing in Ayurveda. This is another trick.

That's the Indian system medical. Firstly, there is no need to have any guru for that, you can always get it in the market. But these medicines are made out of absolutely fresh leaves, fresh roots, everything fresh, that only grows in India. Fruits, fresh fruits.

For example, you people take Liv 52 here, is made from a little fruit we call as aronya in India, from that, aronya. So if you eat for a week aronya your liver is all right, you don't have to take this Liv 52 all your life. And they are very limited, few, but there are some medicines which are very few, which are there, which can be helpful, which can be also made into pills and could be selled. Could be make into pills. Next time I'll try to bring some for you. But the best way is Sahaja Yoga, is your own power. If you need any additional help then we do use vibrated water, vibrated sugar, vibrated salt and also we use certain these medicines little vibrated. Very, very, very few.

And also Hatha Yoga, some exercises we tell you whenever it is necessary, very few. Like wherever there is a chakra damaged because of some physical problem, we try to give that particular Hatha Yoga exercise, precisely.

But the way people do Hatha Yoga is taking all the medicines from the medicine chest, without knowing what to take, what not to take. Actually it is not Hatha Yoga — Ha Tha, means both the Nadis have to be used, it's only Ha they use. And this can cause such an imbalance within you, that [UNCLEAR] can become extremely dry, hot tempered and may divorce his wife, may not produce any children.

Now the women who are very right-sided, over right-sided, very left-sided also cannot produce children. And they have so many problems otherwise.

So that means is that we have to be in the centre, our Kundalini should be fixed permanently with that all-pervading Power and the flow should be all the time within you.

But apart from physical, mental and emotional life, you have the spiritual life, which is much more miraculous, which is very blissful and when you understand how this power of Love looks after you, you are amazed. You don't worry about anything.

That's what doctor Wallace told about Me, that he cannot cope with Me. But the main thing is I don't do anything. If I'm travelling I'm there, if I'm with you I'm here, so what am I doing? So I don't think I do anything. My love just flows, that's all, I know that it flows, that's all, but I don't do anything. Because that is My nature. That's how it is going to work out with you all, but I will advise you first not to touch the patient, use the photograph.
