b"Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Conference. Moscow (Russia), 2 July 1990.\n\n[Introduction with various presenters.]\n\n[Starts at 26:03]\n\nI bow to all the seekers of truth.\n\nIn the medical studies, whatever we have discovered so far is there already, available. And whatever we can discover with human awareness has its own limitations.\n\nSupposing- it is said that the human body does not accept any foreign body or foreign thing into its being, but when the foetus is implanted, then it is looked after, it is not thrown out. It's looked after and thrown out at the right time.\n\nAlso the mode of the acetylcholine and adrenaline in our body- mode of action- cannot be explained because sometimes they augment and sometimes they relax.\n\nWe cannot even explain the action of our spleen, there are so many things that cannot be explained through medical achievements. So we have to know that there's much to be known and much to be found out. So, I would like you all to know something of the beyond which is not known so far. And for you, I would request to have an open mind of a scientist to see for yourself if it is true or not. Till then it is like a hypothesis. So, Sahaja Yoga gives you the complete picture, total picture of the totality of consciousness. And as you grow higher and higher in Sahaja Yoga, you yourself understand and then can work out this great system.\n\nFirst, we have to accept that we are not only this human body, nor our emotions and neither our ego and conditioning. But we are the Spirit, the pure Spirit. And another thing that one has to understand, that there is an All-pervading Power of love which does all this living work of creating flowers, creating fruits, and making us human beings.\n\nOf course, in science, there is no place for love as such, it doesn't talk of love. But, even the doctors have to love the patients otherwise they cannot dedicate. So, first, the doctor has to become the Spirit and has to feel the cool vibrations around him, which are the proof of this All-pervading Power of love. Now, this is the instrument [chart of the chakras] which you have to use, first of all for cleansing yourself and for cleansing others.\n\nIn the medical terminology, we can say that it's the parasympathetic nervous system which is looked after by the central channel and the left and right is looked after by two more channels.\nAccording to Sahaja Yoga, left and right sympathetic are two separate energies. The left one is the one which comforts us, the right one is the one which counsels us and the centre one is the one which redeems us. So, all this is after Realization, because you have to have the connection.\nNow, in human beings, the centres are in the spinal cord and also in the brain. And they are formed like this from the left and the right, and both put together is the central system. The triangular bone in which this Kundalini resides is called as sacrum, as you know. \xe2\x80\x98Sacrum\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99 so the Greeks knew about it and they put that word in the medical terminology also \xe2\x80\x98sacred\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nSo, according to Sahaja Yoga, we are actually, basically, three types of people. Firstly, either we go to the left or to the right. Left side is our desires that have worked out and also whatever doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out goes into our subconscious on the left side, and then into the Collective Subconscious. We can say that it looks after our psyche. It starts from down below there [from Mooladhara] from the last centre, goes upward and crosses over at the optic chiasma and creates what you call as the super-ego in psychological terms. It's the conditioning. The lower centre also nourishes the pelvic plexus which is responsible for our excretion. Also, it looks after sex.\n\nSo one has to have within sane ideas about sex because this channel originates from the last centre.\nBut when Freud talked of the psyche he perverted the whole thing. Instead of telling people how to safeguard this centre, how to safeguard this centre of innocence by looking after the sex habits, he just told the other way round. He related everything to sex as if human beings are just sex points. And he formed a very funny self-opinionated ideology that every man has sexual feelings for his mother. Horrible! On this mental projection, he based all his theory and people thought it was so-called \xe2\x80\x98freedom\xe2\x80\x99 to have sex the way they like. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t even challenge him, he became more than Christ to them in the West.\n\nAs a result, we have now the invasion of AIDS. We have got all kinds of these diseases like gonorrhoea, and all these serious diseases which are, they say so at least 60 % [of people] in America. All related to sex organs. It was always called as private, \xe2\x80\x98private parts\xe2\x80\x99 but it was never understood what does that mean.\nNow, so to the left side is the psychic problem and the right side is the physical problems, somatic problems.\n\nNow the somatic problems are when you work too hard and think too much, we have to just think. Then we start using this centre [Swadisthana], the second centre. When we think too much, then we have to supply energy for the brain. So, all the energy of this centre goes to such a brain which thinks too much, which is futuristic. And other important functions it has to do which are neglected.\nSo the right-sided problems are caused by \xe2\x80\x93 you get a bad liver, over-active liver and you get diabetes because pancreas it not looked after. You get leukaemia because the spleen is not looked after. You get high-blood pressure because the kidneys are in trouble. As the heat of the liver ascends you get asthma. You all know that the brain is like a spongy matter, sort of sponge, and in a way, coagulates. Same thing happens to kidneys when the heat goes to the kidneys. They cannot pass the urine. The urine circulates in the body and in the blood. Also, it causes constipation.\n\nSo heat makes - is the symptom of disease and coolness is the symptom of a prevalence [unsure].\nSo, they have experimented with helium gas and when they gave heat to helium, they found out that all the molecules were fighting with each other. And when they cooled it then they found all the molecules were collective.\n\nNow, the third type of diseases are psychosomatic, combination of both. But, those who are psychosomatic, they have more problem with the psyche than with the physical. I'll explain to you about cancer, it is a psychosomatic according to us. All these viruses are the dead plants or dead animals, maybe microscopic, which have gone out of the circulation of evolution. They reside in the area which we call as Collective Subconscious.\nDoctors have reached a certain understanding about it, little certain understanding, that they say there are putting 53 and 58 [proteins] which triggers the cancer. They also say that this cancer is caused to a person when he goes into some sort of a shock or someting and this attack comes from, triggering comes from the area which was built within us since our creation. This is the same area which I'm telling you, is the Collective Subconscious where everything that is dead is there. So there are people, also humans beings, who are dead and hanging around there, dead souls.\n\nNow, I will tell you something which you may never have heard with medical science. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the complete picture in any case about that.\n\nThere is a soul which is made of all the elements, which is attached in loops on the back side of our body, in all the seven centres plus the sacrum bone where it resides. It makes seven loops. As I told them because after Realization you can see many loops like a round, round thing in loops, and you see them like chakras and one into another, many of them, sometimes together, sometimes only one. Also, you can see a little spark like a comma, that is the Chaitanya, that is the vibration. Now, I have told them that these are the dead souls hanging around.\n\nNow, this soul is reflected on our cells or in the receptor in it. Recently, very recently in America, they have now pictured the receptor of a cell. It exactly looks like the one you see there, after Realization in the air, exactly! But when another soul sits on the being then it is reflected on the cells \xe2\x80\x93 dead soul, another dead soul. It affects the soul, it affects then because it is reflected in the cell, it also affects the reflection in the receptor. Then this soul, this new soul which is there - it might get attached to anyone of the centres or to all of them, depends on - affects the cells also.\n\nAnd they create all these dopamine series which causes epilepsy, mental problems, also cancer, also AIDS also all these things.\nSo, if they are viruses, then it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad. I mean only one portion can be affected but it can travel from one to another. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s a human possession then it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult.\n\nSo, now with Sahaja Yoga to cure the diseases which you are giving Me here [Shri Mataji reads a paper]. Out of it, I'll give it out to you is:\nHypertension can be caused by both of them.\nHeart disease could be also from the brain.\nEpilepsy definitely from the left side.\nMigraine or sick headaches could be from both sides.\nOsteo?\nSahaja Yogi: Osteoarthritis.\nShri Mataji: What is that?\nSahaja Yogi: It's pain in the bones.\nShri Mataji: All these bone diseases it looks like, what you call arthritis?\nSahaja Yogi: Similar.\nShri Mataji: It is this also is psychosomatic.\nLeukaemia is definitely psychosomatic. Tumours are psychosomatic.\nWomen diseases: fibrosis, menopause. Just think, menopause is not a disease, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s a normal thing.\n\nInflammation of the pancreas could be also psychosomatic.\nColitis need not be, need not be. It can be somatic also. No, actually, colitis is left side. It's left side, sorry.\nWhat isreticulum arthritis [unsure]?\nSciatica could be both, could be psychosomatic could be somatic.\nAll mental diseases are left sided, absolutely. Schizophrenia absolutely. Alcoholism is created by the right side creating a left-sided problem.\nArthritis is psychosomatic.\nVaricosity is right-sided.\nNow bad habits like drugs, addiction, smoking, homosexuality and all kinds of perverted sex, too much indulging into sex is all due to psychosomatic or left sided, absolutely left sided.\n\nSee, drug addiction, smoking creates left-sided problems because one feels guilty. But we can say that perverted sex habits and flirting of the eyes, and what else is, and AIDS, and what you call too much of sex, or rigidity and also interest in- I said perverted sex it's all right - all this is due to left side. It is some sort of a possession.\nInfantile paralysis [Polio] is left-sided, same thing, multiple sclerosis absolutely, this is left, this centre [Shri Mataji shows a chakra on the chart]. We cured, the other day, one lady of multiple sclerosis in about ten minutes and she started walking so fast.\nNeurosis could be from both the sides. Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s also from the same. [Shri Mataji shows the same chakra same chakra]. Left side.\nRheumatism is the Nabhi, Left Nabhi, left side.\nMuscular dystrophy also left side.\n\nStroke could be, depends on if it is on the left-hand side [of the brain], then it is from the somatic side. If it is on the right-hand side [of the brain], then it is from the left side.\n\nThen there is Yuppie\xe2\x80\x99s disease. Yuppie\xe2\x80\x99s disease is where, this is neuro, this is neuro, Yuppie\xe2\x80\x99s disease is where you are very hard working, extremely futuristic and you use your conscious mind too much, studying too much also. Then the conscious mind becomes absolutely paralyzed. You are walking alright and suddenly you are conscious that you are walking, you're just paralyzed. I 've told about Yuppie\xe2\x80\x99s disease about eight years back in America, that it will come. But they did not listen to Me. Now it is a very, very serious disease, very serious. And it's fast spreading, very fast spreading. I told them about AIDS about, I think, fourteen years back. They laughed at Me. Now they are in it.\n\nDiabetes is partly, very partly we should say, left, mostly right..\n\nCancer is like this: you see, this is the centre [SM makes two moving exactly superposed circles with two fingers of left hand and two fingers of right hand] and the energy goes through it. But when you move one circle too much, to left or right, eespecially to the right, when you use too much a circle, so the two circles are no longer rightly superposed, then exhaustion takes place. So, you are vulnerable. And suddenly happens from the left side, it [the circle] breaks. And the connection with the whole is lost. These proteins like 53, 58, are very ego-oriented and arbitrary. Whatever cell they touch, that becomes malignant. Thus malignancy sets in.\n\nSo women suffer from breast cancer. The centre of the heart is the Mother's centre. When the motherhood of a woman is challenged, say the husband is a flirt and keeps her insecure, or if she's very much insecure from her side also, then this centre gets tarnished. This centre produces antibodies to fight the diseases in the sternum bone till the age of twelve years. Then they are distributed all over. Whenever there is fear the sternum bone shakes and it is like a remote control that sends messages to all the antibodies to fight. If you can establish the security of such a lady through Kundalini awakening, nourishing her centre here [Heart], then her cancer can be cured. When they are in very advance stages they do not have that will- power left. Then it's better to remove the breast and then establish your security.\n\nAlready there are diseases which are caused by the lethargic organs.\n\nWhen heart is lethargic one gets angina. When the left Vishuddhi catches you feel very guilty and then there's a block and the blood cannot flow to the head, then it has to go to the heart and such a heart becomes tired and lethargic.\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga we have two types of organs: one is lethargic and the other is over active.\n\nLooking at the photographs, there are also vibrations. The doctors should first of all establish themselves properly and protect themselves, then they can also learn how to cure others.\n\nBut in the beginning, you can use the photographs which have the vibrations in them, to find out how to cure the different centres. They are of three types: left side, right side, and both sides-psychosomatic.\n\nBut, as I said, psychosomatic must be dealt as first on the left side.\n\nSome children suffer from hyper activity. Diabetes also comes from the same reason as for children. At the time when the mother is pregnant she should not work very hard. She should take rest more. She should not think too much but read something soothing, something nice. Best is to meditate.\n\nAt that time if the mother is over-active and thinking of futuristic things, children are born with these diseases. Or if she's hectic the child may get leukemia because the spleen is used for all emergencies because it produces red blood corpuscles. But if you are hectic, panicked all the time, rushing about then the poor spleen cannot understand. It becomes erratic and crazy. It could happen to children or adults.\n\nWhen something triggers from the left side and there's sudden shock, may be sadness, accident anything, it triggers leukemia, as well as for the children.\n\nBut the worst thing which is very difficult for anyone to understand is that there are negative forces working. They work through negativity. They work through some false guru, or parapsychology or mesmerism, any things like that. All these things are done through putting some sort of a dead soul on your soul. So, one has to be very clear.\n\nFor this [Realisation] you cannot charge money because it is a living process of evolution.\n\nAnything living: for example you sow a seed. You don't pay money to Mother Earth. She does it. It is built in the seed as well as Mother Earth. We also take all the living processes for granted without thinking about it. There's no obligation.\n\nBut all these horrible people are money-oriented. They have no purity of heart or purity of eyes. They are interested in women, men or all kinds of dirty things. The worst of these things is that they are not able to explain how they do it. They cannot relate it to medical science or any science.\n\nNow they try to do marketing of Ayurveda. It's another trick.\n\nSahaja Yogis know about it. Firstly, it's not needed to have any guru for that, you can always get it in the market. But all these medicines are made out of absolutely fresh leaves, fresh roots, everything fresh, that only grows in India. For example\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga we do some Hatha Yoga exercises whenever necessary, very few. When there is a chakra damaged because of some physical problem, we try to give that particular Hatha Yoga exercise.\n\nBut the way people do Hatha Yoga is to take all the medicines at once and without knowing what they take. In Hatha -- Ha and Tha both the Nadis have to be used. But nowadays its only Ha [right side] used. This can cause a great imbalance within you. People who do this can become extremely dry, hot tempered and may divorce his wife or leave his children.\n\nNow the women who are very concerned, over right-sided, very left-sided, also they cannot go this way. And they have so many problems otherwise.\n\nSo that means that we have to be in the centre and Kundalini should be fixed permanently with that All-Pervading Power and flow all the time within you.\n\nBut apart from physical, mental and emotional life, you have the Spiritual life, which is much more miraculous, which is very blissful and when you understand how this power of Love looks after everything, you are amazed.\n\nThey all talked about this. That was...\n\n...\n\nH.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi\n\n"
