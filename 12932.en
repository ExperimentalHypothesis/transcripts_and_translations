Sometimes please My people, without understanding, what is the reality they motivate and then they start misusing that but then it becomes a curse on them. So one should keep one’s  worship Bhakti (devotion) absolutely accurate, that’s the best way. All right. Mother is laughing for something. It is very sad to see a lady being torchered like this. But in those days it was so but not now. All she went, she has gone in the history of a greatSati and all these powers are on the right side like Savitri Gayatri all of them are, some of them are on the left side. They became powers within us. So their sacrifices have created powers within us.
