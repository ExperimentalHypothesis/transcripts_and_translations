Evening Program, Vienna, Austria 1990-07-21

Shanta Mavshi: Shri Mataji wants that I should explain the meaning of this song to you all.

I have already explained to the students who were learning. This song is mainly to say that you may call God by different names, but He is one and the same. So you may call Him Ram, you may call Him Bhrama, you may call Him Kana or Mahadev. Kana is Krishna, Shri Krishna and Mahadev is Lord Shankara's name is Mahadev, Parasnaath. Parasnaath is the name of Mahaviras, that is those who follow Jainism. They may call Him by the name of Parasnaath.

Shri Mataji: And he has a Kundalini on top of His head. Parasnaath was one of the first, the first, the [unclear]. And this one was the last.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes.So and also some people even call Him by the name of Brahma, but all this is in one and that is Sarkala Brahma.

Shri Mataji: He is the Paramchaitanya, completely. [unclear] self, itself.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes, [unclear]. Now Bhaganabhe, the Kahavatana, that is this external forms of worship may be different.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi/marathi] Different utensils are made [unclear]

Shanta Mavshi: but the mud is the same.

Shri Mataji: Mud is the same. Shanta Mavshi: Yes, and you may see it in different shapes. The shapes are different, but the material is the same.

Shri Mataji: It's the ruptika.

Shanta Mavshi: And, So if we divide God into so many forms, it is in our own, because of our own imagination. Yes. You are undivided. The God within you, which dwells within you, is one. Undivided.

Shri Mataji: Enjoy himself.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: The one who is enjoying himself is the Rama, means if you also say.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes. The followers of Rama are the type who enjoy within themselves. And the followers of Rahimah are those who are kind to others. Compassion. Kindness and compassion for others is the quality of those. Rahimah. Yes.

Shri Mataji: Quality of Rahimah.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So those who follow should have that.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes. Those who follow Rahimah should have the quality of being kind and compassionate to others. Karma philosophy of Gita is for those who worship Shri Krishna.

Shri Mataji: The karma becoming akarma. Once you become surrendered to Shri Krishna and He does everything, you don't do anything. So this is the karma philosophy of Shri Krishna. That you surrender yourself to Him, so you don't do anything. The one who does like that are the ones who follow Shri Krishna should do that.

Shanta Mavshi: Then Mahadeva, [unclear].

Shri Mataji: If you worship Shiva, then you should just ask for nirvana, for realization and nothing else. Shanta Mavshi: Then the last is Paraseh. Paraseh is to see. Paraseh.

Shri Mataji: Parashnath is the deity. In the [unclear] of Jainese. And the Parashnath has got the Kundalini behind him. So he is the master of Kundalini. So Paraseh Rupa. Paraseh Rupa means the one who changes the form. He is the Paraseh. Paraseh is the stone which converts everything into gold.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes, that I have explained to them.

Shri Mataji: Paraseh means the transformation. The one who transforms your, your... Yourself, you can say, but Rupa actually means your...

Shanta Mavshi: Your whole being is transformed.

Shri Mataji: Your being. Your being is transformed. The one whole being which is transformed, the one who once, who calls themselves as the disciple of Parashnath, should be able to transform the Rupa of the [unclear]. So they are Paras. Paras means the Paras stone is the one which, if you touch to anything, it is a... What is it called in English? It becomes gold.

Shanta Mavshi: It is a [unclear]. It is called [unclear].

Shri Mataji: It is [unclear]. So if you, Paras means [touch stone?]. Yes. So the one who, who is the one who is following Parashnath, should be able to transform people. Brahma [unknown] Brahmari. The one who can recognize the Brahma, means the Chaitanya, is the Brahma. [hindi/marathi]

Shanta Mavshi: Anandagana.

Shri Mataji: Anandagana is the cloud of joy.

Shanta Mavshi: It is the name of the poet also. Yes.

Shri Mataji: Also the poet's name. Yes. So he said, this is how you have to, you have to sort of, this is a Muranglapa. You must achieve. This is the way you should achieve your cloud of joy.

Shanta Mavshi: Chaitanya-mana.

Shri Mataji: Which is Chaitanya-maya and nikarma, means there is no karmas there. It is Chaitanya-maya, nikarma.

Means it is without any karma, action. So you achieve that. It's beautiful. Put it in Anandagana.

Shanta Mavshi: Anandagana.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful, I mean such a thing is. Absolute truth.

Shanta Mavshi: Philosophy is really beautiful. The whole philosophy in this, highest.

Shri Mataji: Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga.

Shanta Mavshi: That's why I chose it for this. And it is in Rag [Paddhik?].

Shri Mataji: Yes. [unknown] Take it off, please. You want to sing some song now?

Yogi: The Children have a song. They have a special song for you too.

Shri Mataji: The children from France. Alright. You want to [unclear]? You see I told them that they should make some songs on the pop style. Because you see it's very popular and if you can make nice songs on Sahaja Yoga on pop style also it can go on the stages and we can impress people much more by that you see. And there are some very good songs also. So this one Mr. [unclear] if you know him from Canada, he's also making some very beautiful songs like that. And I'm sure these songs once they become popular Sahaja Yoga will spread much faster because these Indian songs are all right for Maharashtra. And now pop music is even popular in India also. So you see to popularize the music is better to compose songs in pop music also. If you people can try some will be good idea. So that we could have some pop music and in that we sing about Sahaja Yoga because after all we have to communicate and these are the days when there's a demand. So one should do it.

So this is something is a big venture and I think it will all work out very well. Real pop style should be.

Shanta Mavshi: We are trying our best to save classical music from popularization.

Shri Mataji: You see if Sahaja Yoga spread is classical music will spread.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You see these people can you imagine we could not teach one sound to these English people. But how they have learnt it through the Omkara. Because the Atma is awakened. It can just feel the classical music in no time. But first to awaken that we have to go through this method.

Shanta Mavshi: Yes. To spread Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Very powerful at this. Powerful. We must accept the power of the song. That's why people like it. You see and we should use it now. I think there's no harm about that. Only thing is once they become Sahaja Yogis they are all going to sing, Amhi Bi Gadhalo Before that we have to bring them now. And it's very assertive song, very assurance song that we are the light.

It's a fact. So why not say it? All right, so let's have one. What about you? Where is he? Are you going to give some song?

Yogi: Of course.

Shri Mataji: With the group. I told that we'll have some music program. You should have arranged.

Yogi: Sorry

Shri Mataji, but the [unclear] is not here. I mean there are so many people still in... In Praga, in Praga.

Shri Mataji: Why is it missing?

Yogi: In Budapest.

Shri Mataji: All right, so now let's have a collective song May God bless you all. So tomorrow again my tour starts. Continuous. But it was a nice rest here. So I am again going on my tour.

Continuous. It was such a nice relief to come here and rest and enjoy your company. May God bless you all. But you all have to now move out to other countries and try to see that you establish Sahaja Yoga properly. Be kind to them, be nice to them. And also there are oppositions from other people, no doubt. But you have to be very patient with them and try to tell them that you haven't found anything so far. Why don't you find out what is the truth? Why don't you find it out? If you are kind to them they might accept your invitation.

So I hope all of you will take the responsibility as such to go around and help people. And specially women I think because they are much more free than men are, men are working. Those who are free can go around and can really spread Sahaja Yoga. In any case I am coming back for Ganesha Puja which I hope this time you will have all your [unclear] ready, all your music ready, everything in a big way. And we are really going to enjoy Ganesha Puja this time. I feel one thing about Sahaja Yogis that there are some Sahaja Yogis who are very active. And I find some Sahaja Yogis only come to receive me at the airport. That's all. They are like tourists, you see. Just come for the receiving at the airport or for something.

This is not the way. You must know you have to work for Sahaja Yoga. If you don't work for Sahaja Yoga you cannot progress. It's like one door is open, one window is open. But if you don't open the other window there cannot be any circulation, there cannot be any freshness and you cannot growth. Now I have seen those people who have really done any work for Sahaja Yoga have gone all out, attended all the programs, everything with dedication and have gone very fast. All such people who are just [unclear] will be very late or maybe completely discarded. Or could be that they may not have any saying the matter. So as it is I think it is very important that we should value our self-respect, our self-knowledge, our self-realization. I need not tell you this because you know that you have got your self-realization and I feel you give it embarrass to say this.

But I have seen this tendency in many people and I am amazed that after getting all these blessings, after knowing that this is the truth, after knowing that we are born in these important times, after knowing that we are chosen people, after knowing that we have got realization, even then they take it lightly as something like a pastime is very wrong. So what I know about is that there are about few people who are really doing work of Sahaja Yoga, running about, organizing everything. The rest of them are just like visitors and that is a very wrong attitude, very wrong attitude. See there is not much sacrifice in general. Nobody has to sacrifice anything. On the contrary you all are blessed, thousand time blessed, you've got everything. But what have you done for that? What have you given for Sahaja Yoga? What have you given for God? This work.

What have you done for Him? It has been only one sided thing that we have received all the blessings and I received letters, somebody sick you must cure, somebody is not well, do this, do that. That's all. It's all one sided. But why?
