Dance and Talk

Shri Mataji: Such talents, such mastery of Mrs Kanan on what we call the "bhawas" means the emotions, the way she expressed her emotions ...She is really a master if she was in India people would have really knew that such a great artist is being sent to NewZealand.It should not have been done :)
And a little girl I must say for a rage, she is so dynamic, so rhythmic and so perfect. All these dances I know very well because I have been seen dancing from the very childhood of mine I should say...The perfection they have achieved is really remarkable ...I don't know how far you have understood the different moods have shown if in one after the other ...How she has gone from one mood to another mood. It's very difficult If you see the expressions on the face hands everything...It's a very difficult dance and also the dance that you saw of "Jattiswaram" Also is a very vigorous dance. All these are extremely beautifully manifested and I haven't seen such a group of mother and daughter doing such good work so far ...May God Bless them. I am so very happy to be here to see all this. Moreover, I would say that all the Sahaja yogis should try to learn from them ...That such a little girl how she has dedicated herself to her mother's rt and how she has learnt from her... And how both of them are so dedicated ...Let us see now how many of you can really take to it and practice it and understand it...Its also so spiritual so joy-giving ...the Marathi music that you heard. You must be surprised because in the south Shivaji's younger son was sung there ...He was given an area of Thanjavur as a present and He wrote everything in Marathi language and did all this what you call ...Bharatnatyam which is south Indian style of dancing ...So the Marathi Dance is actually in the style of south India and he also has a very big library in Thanjavur...I being there ...I have been able to see all these things the beautiful things he has done ... So that we can see that in India we have so many types of dancings the first one is an Odyssey dance...Odyssey dance is a dance you should say is performed ...I feel that it is a combination of Kathak and Bharatnatyam ...Because it has the more...... feet are more bent than the Bharatnatyam i should say ...Or the body is more bent ...than the Bharata Natyam but the music is North Indian sung in a north Indian way and mostly in the Hindi language...It is very beautiful ...I have seen some very great musicians and also the dancers many times...Many a time I have seen them and this has been revived ...Thi dance has been revived but the beauty of this performance I feel that I have never felt one artist doing both ...It is very surprising she has done it ...I have only seen one Pawar (Mr and Mrs Pawar) where she doesn't d odyssey but she does it with Kathak...Kathak and Odissi she does ...KAthak and Odyssey (also the Jaipur Gharana ) she is from Jaipur Gharana ...
She is a very versatile lady I must say this ....very versatile ...I thought she must be Bengali from the name but I am surprised that Maharashtrians you see...especially are not good at dancing because It was not regarded as a dance to be learnt by Girls and nobody allowed us to learn dancing in childhood ...But Music of course ...The music they were very good ...but dancing was not allowed but slowly I think this came into the heads of the Maharashtrians also that its a great art and we should practice because you can see here how this the brother of Shivaji himself did all kinds of things and there is another very nice style of dancing here is "stillllana"09:47 which is actually taken from Tarana from the north from the Kathak and its footwork is something like kathak only so the way he actually integrated shows even a Maharashtrian can have a great sense of music. Now we have seen such beautiful dancing and such nice bhaktas (devotees) and the especially the last one is the "shant rasa " that we have saw ...In which "shant " is the peaceful one...Then she is talking about the "muni's" (the one the yogis are ) how they are peaceful and she has shown how they are peaceful Surprisingly there one hand at the top of the head and one hand on the nabhi chakra suggesting of the Kundalini and it is though they do not know but it is very innately built on the spiritual aspect of life ...All these dancings have to suggest that we have a higher life and a greater life than what we see it today or the mundane life the reality lies beyond all these illusions that we have ...I am more charmed by the fact that in a place like Newzealand they should really perform such beautiful dance and keep to it you have to go on practising otherwise you lose the art So it is all creditable and all my admiration for them ...May God bless all of them ...May God bless you ...Thank you!
[Then there is a small conversation with the artists which is not audible as there is no mike used ]
