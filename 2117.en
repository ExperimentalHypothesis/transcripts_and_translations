Public Program. Genoa (Italy), 18 June 1996.

(Shri Mataji is greeted by an authority from Genoa, and receives books about Christopher Columbus as a present).

I bow to all the seekers of Truth and Peace. When we talk of peace, we must know by talking we cannot create peace. At a human level, with this human awareness, we have so many complications. We have to evolve little more to achieve our selfhood. Every religion has talked about self-knowledge. If we do not know ourselves, how can we know anything else? For this, as you have been already told, there is a Power in the triangular bone, which is known as Sacrum. That means that Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone. In India we knew about it thousands of years back, no doubt. But it was kept a secret, and was given by one person to one person. Till the 12th century, nobody even talked about it to general public. Then in the 16th century there were many saints who talked about it. Even Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to know yourself if you want to know God.

But self-knowledge is something which is not imaginary, it is not mental. We live in a mental world, and I must tell you very humbly that this so-called mind is a myth. It has been created by us through our conditionings and our ego. But beyond this mind is the realm of reality. Unless and until you reach that state of reality, we cannot find peace within ourselves. If there is no peace within, what’s the use of talking about peace? But it’s a very simple thing to understand, that human awareness is not the perfect, absolute truth. Because somebody says: “This is the truth,” another says: “This is the truth,” another says: “That is the truth.” Is not absolute! And so all the quarrels and fights start on this point. But when you know the absolute truth, then all of you will feel, will know the same.

Now as you see I’m sitting before you, there is no difference of opinion. In the same way, if you see the truth, then there will be no difference of opinion. You have been already told about the power which resides in the triangular bone, which is your individual Mother. She knows everything about you, she knows what have you been doing, what wrong things you have done. She also knows what are your aspirations for [the] future. Is like a tape recorder of your being. When it rises, pierces through these centres, ultimately from the last centre, it becomes one with the all-pervading power of Divine Love.

So there’s....the truth about yourself is this, that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit. And the another truth is, that there is a all-pervading power of Divine Love which does all the living work. Now this Divine Power has been described in most of the scriptures. It can be called by many names, but we see all these flowers, we take them for granted, it’s a miracle. We never even think, what a miracle it is. So many living things are going on in this world, we never even think about them, we take it for granted. Who does this? That is done by this all-pervading power. So now, after this human state, one has to evolve to a higher state of spirituality, of becoming the Spirit. This has to be, otherwise this world will collapse. Human life will collapse.

These centres that are within you, when they go into jeopardy, then get you get diseases. All physical, mental, and emotional, even spiritual problems are coming from these centres within us. So when this Kundalini rises, she nourishes all these centres, she integrates them, not only that, but she enlightens them. Then she becomes one with this, connected with this all-pervading power, and you become a powerful person of Divine Love. Now how the peace is established, is like this that we are all the time thinking about future or about the past. We cannot be in the present. So one thought rises and falls, another thought rises and falls, and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts all the time. But when this Kundalini rises, what she does is first of all she sucks in those thoughts and also makes them (here Mother seems to refer to the ego and superego balloons) elongated so a space is created. And you reach a state which we call as thoughtless awareness. You are aware, you’re absolutely aware but there’s no thought. If you want to think you can, but you become master of your thoughts. Thus, peace is established within you. For example, if you are standing in the ocean and there are waves, you are afraid of them. But supposing you get into a boat then you can watch these waves and enjoy them. But in case you learn how to swim, you can jump and bring out many people from the ocean of fear. Same thing happens when you evolve, you become first thoughtlessly aware, and then you become doubtlessly aware. As a result of this awakening, your Spirit comes into your attention. That means it enlightens your attention. You develop tremendous compassion, but this compassion can act. You may feel very sorry for a person who’s sick, but if you have got your self-realisation, you can cure that person. As I told you, this is the last breakthrough of your evolution.

Of course you can’t pay for it, because it’s a living process. When you put a seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts. How much do we pay to the Mother Earth? Is your right to have this realisation, is your birthright. All arrangements are made within you. You must actually forgive yourself, completely, also not to think: “I’ve done this wrong, that wrong.” Also you have to forgive everyone else. Because whether you forgive or don’t forgive, logically you don’t do anything. You become like a saint, I should say. But you don’t give up your family, you don’t give up your house or anything! The transformation comes within. It is the actualisation of baptism, when you say you are born again. It’s not giving (?) certificate that you are born again, but it’s actual happening to you. It is the actualisation of becoming. Is not just talk. And which is so simple.

I have been to Genoa before twice, but couldn’t do much. I don’t know why but today, after I think two, three years, you people have become so aware! I’m so much enamoured to see all of you here, to receive your self-realisation. As I told you, it’s just like a seed planted in the Mother Earth.: grows by itself, spontaneously, Sahaj. It will take hardly ten minutes for you to get your self-realisation. Those who do not want, of course I cannot force on you. But be confident that all of you are going to get it. Don’t in any way feel guilty. By feeling guilty you spoil the centre on the left hand side here (Shri Mataji touches Her left shoulder), and as a result you might get spondylitis, you might get angina, or you may get very lethargic or else (?). So whatever you have done wrong, is done, finished! This idea is very self-destructive to say that: “I’m guilty, I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done that wrong.” You have to have respect for yourself, because you are a human being on the threshold of your last breakthrough.

So may God bless you all, and let us see how you are going to get your realisation.

Of course I’ll wait for about 15 seconds, if somebody wants to leave can leave the hall, but everybody has to get it. So first we, you have to forgive everyone. Is not difficult, you just have to say: “I forgive everyone,” that’s all. The second thing is that you have to forgive yourself. I would request you to take out your shoes if possible, will be very helpful – it’s this Mother Earth is the one, she sucks in all the problems we have within us of a gross nature. Need not take out your socks. I would request you (...) to be seated, is better to be seated, that’s all. Now you have to put both your hands like this towards Me. As you know these five, six, and seven (Shri Mataji indicates the five fingers and the other two points on the hand corresponding to the chakras) are seven centres represented. On the left side, means the left sympathetic nervous system centres, and right side with the right sympathetic.

So what will happen to you, is that you will feel the cool breeze on your fingertips first, and then it will start moving upward. Also you’ll feel the cool breeze coming out your of fontanel bone area which was soft bone in your childhood. You’ll feel thoughtless and peaceful. Then only you have to learn how to use them (your hands). In the Bible it is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. When this happens, you’ll feel very much better, peaceful, happier, you might even get cured. But this is a collective happening. So, you must know that after getting this, you should try to know all about it by coming to our centres.

Of course you don’t have to pay anything for this subtle knowledge. Only thing you have to give little time for the cleansing process sometimes. This will ensure your peace, it will ensure your physical fitness, it will ensure your happiness in the family, but it will ensure you joy. Joy is singular, is not like happiness and unhappiness, is an experience.

Shri Mataji speaks aside: “They already got it” (meaning the self-realisation).

Now, you have to close your eyes for a while, you can take out your spectacles if you like. Now please don’t doubt yourself, please don’t doubt. And don’t think about what wrong you have done in the past. You have to be in the present.

Now. Close your eyes please, and now, please put your right hand on top of the fontanel bone area. You can bend your head, it will help you more. Now just see if there’s a cool or a hot breeze like (?) vibrations coming out of our fontanel bone area. Some of you can get it very close to your head, and some of you little further, but don’t put your hand on top of your head.

Now. Put your right hand towards Me, bend your head and see with the left hand, if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please, bend your heads. Please, bend your heads. Now, if it is hot, that means you have not forgiven yourself or forgiven others, so please do that now.

Now. Please have the left hand towards Me again once for all, and again see, bend your heads, and see if there’s a cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please don’t doubt, please don’t doubt. Put your both the hands towards Me, and don’t think. Just don’t think. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this, and push back your head, and ask a simple question three times. The question is – you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji – Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? The another question you can ask: Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Divine Love? Three times.

Now please take down your hands. All those who are feeling cool or hot breeze on their fingertips, or on their palm, or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. The whole of Genoa!

May God bless you all.

I live very close to Genoa, you are all welcome to come and see Me. If you have any problems, you can write to Me. Now just enjoy, that’s all I have to say. (Then Guido explains that Shri Mataji has said that She feels a lot of vibrations arriving on the stage, and that everybody has their mind in silence.) Is a great discovery that so many real seekers are living in Genoa. Now you have grown, you have become a self-realised personality, but the seed has to grow into a tree. For which you have to give very little time to yourself.

(...) This is from a village in India they have picked up a song. You can clap, will help you, clap songs (...?) (The bhajan group start singing Mahamaya Mahakali).
