Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Rahuri (India)
Talk Language: Marathi | Translation (Marathi to English) - VERIFIED

One’s own behaviour should be such that there should be no falsehood in it. Staying within limits (maryada), staying pure, not gossiping , not showing ego, staying disciplined. And should be absolutely proficient in SahajaYoga . I am sitting here to tell you about it all. Down to the most nitty gritty, I am here to tell you all. In London, I have had many such deep discussions, and they have made about 84 recordings of them. They are all in English; you should translate them all. You should listen to them all. Whatever there is to know, unknown or secret, I am going to tell it all to you. But you should be able to digest it all ... .although you could still understand that I(Mataji) is this and that(Who Mataji represents),which In Fact was a tough understanding.

Otherwise, it was going to be difficult. This too, is very difficult. But this you have understood, digested and  imbibed it, this is a very big deed on your part. In the past, even sadhus and saints got  realised with great difficulty. Our Gagangad Maharaj, he told people that he  started to feel vibrations after thousands of years of meditation, and Shri Mataji has so easily given to you all realisation for free. He used some very angry language with a few of the sahaja yogis - “Why has Shri Mataji given you these vibrations? What are you going to give her in return? Are you going to give your life for her?” And I mean, in 25 years of penance, he has given realisation only to one person. And after that he has given up saying that the person was useless. And people come from here and there, from jungles ,some from the Himalayas, some after 12 years, some after 14 years - “Mother, we will come after 12-14 years”. I say to them - “Do I have to make pickles out of you?” “No Mother, they are all evil people; they will not understand any of this. You are a Mother. You please do the hard work. You are the Mother of the world. We will come later.” For you, I am going to do this with you while you are here and living a normal social life ,just where you are sitting. You don't have to change anything. Whatever little (the audio is garbled for a second) might be there. What tradition should be called is like a ladder. A ladder that has no base, on which you can never get stability to stand steadily, that cannot be a ladder. Hence, while dropping no tradition that in itself is perpetual, wherever you are and however you are in your homes, in your normal life, this blessed event takes place. And you can see the beautiful manifestation of this love.

The other revolution is that till today everyone has been giving all these big speeches. “You all are brothers together. You should say brothers and sisters.” Once the election is done, those brothers and sisters are left to one side, and someone else comes in their place. Sahajayoga is not like that. An internalised union gets created. A love develops within people, and a loving feeling develops. Now within all that, someone will come in who will try and find some sort of a defect. That something definitely will be found that is not right. Some small insignificant thing will be made into an issue, and then talk about it - why did this not happen? Why did that not happen? Such a person will go out of Sahaja Yoga if he doesn't get rectified. He will get 2 or 3 chances. But after that, he will go out. If anyone finds some such issue, and starts some gossip - tell this here, gossip that there, pitting one person against the other - then I will condemn that person out of Sahayoga. He will go out. I have already said so. Now that Sahajayogis have been formed, they are realised, you have got the nectar and the basic subtlety of it all. And if now, if after all that, you still start some vile deeds, then where can I position you? I cannot seat you with the animals, because animals are not like that. Once they know the master, they stick with the master. So where, pray tell me, should I seat such people? So... I will seat them in the same row as the devils (rakshasas). I don't know where else to put such Sahaja Yogis. So, please do not behave like this.

Sahaja Yoga is obtained through a lot of past penance, from pure and good deeds done in the past. You have got this because of your own pure past deeds. Don't waste it. What are you going to get from doing so? What benefit do you get from this behaviour? Making up some insignificant issue, continually gossipping, increasing hostilities, affecting personal relationships, or creating conflicts between others... How is all this going to benefit you? If you see such a person, you should shut your ears to that person. You should say - “I am sorry, dear.” No one should speak out against someone else in Sahaja Yoga. If there is something, talk to me. I have my attention on each and everyone. You don’t have any need to go and correct anyone yourself. And again, I have even said that if someone says something against me, or against Sahaja Yoga, and if you don’t want to listen to that, then you absolutely don’t have to. Because, as has been written in the Devi Mahatmya, one shouldn’t be listening to the a-bhaktas (those who are unbelievers). That too is a sin. You should want to stay pure. Now it is OK to debate whether Shri Mataji said this or that, but if you are going to stay silent, and listen to them, then you should know that the devils will make it hard for you. This sharpness is an attribute that is required in Sahaja Yoga. This is not a task for crybabies. Sharpness is required. If you have to tell some people off, you should be able to. If the need arises, you should be able to stand up and speak out. And you should be able to say that if you see falsity somewhere, then you should say that, as Shri Mataji has said, this is falsehood, why are you doing all this? Just going along making all these speeches,You cannot reach God by doing this. What is the point of doing all this drama? If you don't speak, then your kids will. My granddaughter, she is one who is realised. She was born like that, extremely powerful. And they had gone to see these Lama people in Ladakh with her parents. Now they are not realised, her parents. My daughter is not a realised soul. Now both of them, they fell at the feet of this Lama. Now my granddaughter... She did not like this. She is all of 5 years old. She went and stood like this. “What is all this - you are wearing a toga and you have shaved your head.. And now you are having everyone touch your feet. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Are you at least a realised soul yourself?”. Even the Lama himself was shocked. So her mother scolded her saying she shouldnt say such things. So she said back that there is no need to fall at this person’s feet. Why are you doing this? 

If a 5-year old girl has this radiant power in her, then imagine how much radiance should reside in you. But they are born powerful. They are very great beings. Now just like that, my other granddaughter, the elder one... once I was called as a chief guest to one of these brahmarshiraman events [ceremonial events in the Ramakrishna school of spirituality]. So there were a fair few Sahaja Yogis there as well. And she was sitting there in the front row. And all these people from the Ramakrishna Ashram, all these pompous people - all of them 6 feet tall, wearing togas and their only dharma was eating continuously. They came and sat near me. And this person was their president, and I was the chief guest. I sat somehow next to them. And they were emitting such heat. So hot. She couldn't bear it. She stood up. She calls me “Naani” (granny). She says: “Naani, ask this person wearing maxis to run away. He is emitting such heat. First, you have to ask him to go away from here; he is just throwing out such heat everywhere. All of us are feeling his heat.” And all the Sahaja Yogis were clapping. This president couldn't understand who she was referring to - “the one wearing maxis”. This is what she thought of him. All the others were praising him as a Yoganandji [someone who has obtained a union with god] or a maharaj and so and so forth. A fraud has to be told off. But our Sahajayogis are a bit too gentle “Oh dear, how should we say it?” No, it shouldn't be like that. You should be absolutely clear and direct in saying it. I am a woman and I say so much, then imagine how you should be speaking out. Once you start talking, then at least I will have some time off from doing so. 

In 1970, in the Jehangir Hall, I had taken each and everyone’s names and called them all out. From this end to that. Now it is all coming out, of course. Now all of these people, they all came and were saying: “Mataji, what are you doing?”. I asked them what happened? “You are saying all such things to them.” So, what will they do? “They will kill you”. I said, let them try. If they do so, I am going to hit them hard and see what they can do about it. When I was hit, I took in on purpose. Now at least let them come in front of me. Their hands will be trembling in fear. Let them come, let's see who can dare to do so - heroes!!! They haven’t spoken one word against me. And in each speech, I take a good dig at them . One should have such courage in one’s self. You are my children. You should have this heroic courage!. “Oh, but how should we talk? They will not like it. One should speak only in nice decent manners.” (Shri Mataji’s tone is sarcastic for that last sentence.)

That is why I have said: Satyamvade, Priyamvade! One should speak the truth, and should speak lovingly. A question was asked during the time of Krishna. How can one be truthful and loving? If one talks the truth, it more often than not cannot be lovingly said. Usually this never happens. So Krishna said: Satyamvade, Hitamvade, Priyamvade! (Satyamvade - speak the truth. Hitamvade - speak what is beneficial to others. Priyamvade - speak lovingly) If you speak keeping in mind goodwill for others, then it will be truthful. And because it is with goodwill to others, it will also happen with love.

Now, if tomorrow, we are to say to someone that “Come. We will take you on a trip.” Then for some time, he will feel good about it. But after 10 years, he might say: “That highly evil person took me on a trip and brought about my downfall.” That is why one should only speak with goodwill to others. Jagruti (realisation) doesn't mean that you sit yourself in a corner. “Mataji, I sit everyday for your program. I sit in my house. I have kept your photo in a corner. Shyly. I have kept one photo of yours in my temple. Please come to my house to see.” So you have to use a microscope to see where Mataji’s photo has been kept. All the others are kept for everyone to see. All these rakshasas (devils). And somewhere in the corner, Mataji is there. “Oh, but no. That was from my father’s time, or from my grandfather’s time.” My dear, but they have passed now. So take it out now. Otherwise, why did you put fire to them (Indian rituals at the time of death). You should bring them back and put them also there on that wall with everyone else. At Least that would be better. Why have you put these devils on there? Don't you believe that they are devils? That's it then. 

So, in this regard, there is no reason to be diffident about it. And there is no need for this resigned attitude. Because this is a revolution. And a very big revolution it is. We are talking of an internal revolution here. So if someone starts spouting nonsense, then he should be told - “See, forgive us, but we are here to talk of love. And what nonsense are you talking to us about? How is this going to be beneficial to you?”

The other thing we have to achieve in this internal revolution, and you must have realised this by now, is that I want to bring about this internal revolution for the whole world. Those people from London, they said that we have been to India a few times now. But we have never been in contact with Indian people. If we do get in contact then only such people who are like us - they dance like us, they splurge like us. And in hell like us in Calcutta, or in Mumbai or in Delhi. Now where is the real Bharatiya (Indian)? Because if we see them in the villages, they are afraid of us, that is this a soldier who has come to meet us or who else is it. Now we have never been in touch with such people, and because of Sahaja Yoga that contact has now been made. So you should make some friends with them, talk to them, meet them, take them around here for some trips. They have come from those far lands with a will to meet you. Especially in Rahuri. Some people have come especially for Rahuri. You will be surprised. I told them that if you want to go to a village, then come to Rahuri. So just for that, many of these people have come after taking some time off on leave. So, just like that, this internal revolution within oneself, within society,within one’s country, and internationally has to happen through Sahaja Yoga.

Now on a third point, this internal revolution happens. Is with Nature. Even with Nature you have a union. Now I started from Wardha. It was very cold in Wardha. Now along the way in the car, after some time they asked is this towards the south or to the north. I said it is towards the south. “Oh but it is going to be pretty hot there.” I said:” So let's go and see how hot it is going to be. We will see; something will work out.” And ever since we have come here, it has been nice and cool here. Everyone is enjoying themselves. What exactly have you seen of nature? So many have said that in all areas where we had spread the vibrated wheat, it did not rot or was not infected. One may say so, or maybe two, but what if everyone is saying the same thing. That we got increased quantities of wheat, that it was not infected, the taste is so much nicer, that it has these special quantities in it. What this means is that you have even given realisation to nature. Till now, you were receiving from nature. Now, nature will receive something from man.

So, see! How wondrous it has turned out to be. That after evolving from nature, it is the vibrations from man that will be given back to nature. There is no other way out. So, imagine how big a task you have started, and how big a task this is that you are soldiers for. You should realise this, and you should be proud of yourself. And we should live with the dignity that we are something special. Hence, do not think about these shallow deeds . A person who has some dignity within himself, does not behave  in a shallow manner. He doesn't get swayed because of difficult situations. He has his own dignity; his own reputation. He is a reputed person and that can be seen by everyone. Now in Mumbai, I have this one very simple person. He comes from Kalwa which is even beyond Vaitarna. His name is Patil. He has a small farm there. But he was present with his kids, his wife for each and every program of mine. And he has established a big centre there with my name emblazoned in big letters that can be seen by everyone who is passing by on a train. Now I myself asked one day about my name appearing out there. They told me it was Patil’s house. So I said I am going to have to visit him one day. So he has done this massive piece of work there. So I asked him, poor fellow... “Patil, you are coming every single time. How expensive must this be for you?” “Nothing doing Shri Mataji, we are all better now because of your blessings.” I asked him what happened. He said: “Earlier we had some very infertile land earlier, and couldn't really farm here. It was just there. One day, after we took realisation, one Sindhi (community ) came to meet me. He asked me to give him that land on rent. I asked him why. He replied that he would pay me a monthly rent and that all he would do would be to take the soil which would get him some nice income. So, Shri Mataji, we have now started getting some nice income... and this is all because of your blessings . So my kids have started going to school. Those who were dumb have started coming first in class.”

Now, this couldn't work out if it was limited to one person. If Patil had just left it like it was, then there wouldn't have been any progress. But one should not try and put a value to it. That one should practice Sahaja Yoga because such benefits accrue. It should be understood that once you take to Sahaja Yoga, these things happen automatically. It is very difficult for a person to attain a peace of mind. And this thought process should be changed. So when you speak, people should realise that you are something else. Now a simple thing. I said that in Mumbai, I will not take money from illegal sources (the black market). Whether we get land or not. Why do we need land? I have enough land in the hearts of my disciples. If I get land ok, if I don't get land, that too is fine. The work carries on. So, they said you won't get the land. Now I have found a solution to that, and we are going to have a centre where we will have to not give a single paisa of black marketed money. I will tell you details about that later, but I am just informing you now. In such a manner, man should only keep to the truth. Too much wealth is no good, too much property is no good. If you keep to the central path, then you are fine. Not too much or too little wealth. The river flows in the middle. 

Now, many people say... one communist friend of mine. This was an experience in itself. I was travelling on the train, there was this childhood friend of mine who had turned to communism. She is nice, very well behaved. Now my father had stood for elections from Congress, and her father was of the Hindu Marg [a particular kind of political ideology in India following Hinduism]. So I was studying then in Lahore. So she said: “I will stand with you because I cannot support my father. I don't agree with this Hindu Mahasabha. Now because your father is with the Congress, I will be with him.” Now she is from a very nice household. Very prosperous, but now she is Communist. Now, Bogdaun was sitting in a train compartment. And this is where she was sitting too. So she asked him why she was travelling to Rahuri. So many foreigners, why are you going to Rahuri? She couldn't understand. He said that our Guru is there, She is called Mataji. That she is the Devi. Whatever he could, he tried to explain to her. Now she got angry that who is this BhonduMaharaj who is out to fleece these people? [BhonduMaharaj: a fraud]. So she came running along with these people to meet this person.. Me. And they (the foreigners) said they would help her meet me. And what to see that it was her!! So I met her and she hugged me. She said that it was almost like she had met a Mother. That after so many days.. After 20 years, she got to meet me, and that she had heard so much about me.. Felt so proud about me etc etc. All that she said.. Now after that, she started talking about her beloved Communism. That the poor need to eat. Now this is their patent. It is their patent indeed. It's all properly ingrained in them, they have learnt it all. So, all this from the days of yore that if they do not have food to eat, how can they think of getting God? So she took this patent out for a discussion. I asked her how many such people existed in India that didn't have food to eat. No food.. Now Ok, they may not have cars. But how many don't have food to eat? It is contrary these days now. And I have also seen that just by giving money to people, that doesn't give them any benefits. It never benefits them. In fact, if you just distribute money, that is not Lakshmi (prosperity), it is just money. People will definitely take to bad activities. 

My husband was the Chairman of the Shipping Corporation. So the big thing he did was to increase the drivers’ salaries to 1000 rupees. So what a big thing it was. This was talked of all over Mumbai. Waah Waah!! That he has brought up those who are completely downtrodden. Within 5 months all these supposed downtrodden people showed results. All their wives came crying to me - “Mataji, why did you give money to our husbands? They have now kept women. And they drink and beat us. All the kids have had to drop out of school and they are all sitting at home.” What this means is that until a person gets realisation, they cannot digest prosperity. People only see money; let me ask how people who don't have money go on trips, how do they have money to eat tobacco? And no money to eat food?

How many people exist in our country that do not even have enough money to even just eat food? Someone should tell those communist people - Why do you feed yourself by fooling people? And people have made a huge investment out of this. It is said that even here, in our Mumbai also, some buildings have been built by beggars. Entire buildings!!! Even on Marine drive there are three to four buildings owned by these beggars!! And the beggars are demanding: “Are you going to give me or not?” It has come to this. Then.. oh it has become more expensive, so please increase the allowance. Why? They want to drink liquor. Of course, this doesn’t mean that rich  should live as they please; that is absolutely not the case. In fact, the rich have so many  troubles. So much trouble that their children behave like deluded people. This prosperity gets finished in the third generation. If this wealth has no door, no shelter (i.e. no stability or sense of charity), no form of Lakshmi then it will disappear in the third generation. This is definite! Why pay attention to these great fools? Be in the center. What do you need such excessive wealth for? Then... to keep this excess wealth, you lie, do this, do that, indulge into the black market.Just lose your head completely in it. Why do you want this trouble and bother day and night like this? One should remain in the middle ground of satisfaction..

But if there is a Sahajayogi like this , then it is not possible for anyone to believe in Sahajayoga. If a Sahaja Yogi says I want a big car. Now that I have a big car, I want a helicopter. Now that I have a helicopter, I want a big airplane. People will say: “This person has not benefited from Sahaja yoga.” It doesn’t matter how good a speech someone like this may make about Sahaja Yoga. It becomes obvious to everyone. Therefore, a sahaja yogi  should be a satisfied soul. And that can only happen if you all pray saying: “Shri Mataji, give us contentment, satisfaction and fulfilment. You will get whatever you ask for. If you want dissatisfaction (a-Trupti), it can also be given. But you should not want dissatisfaction. However,  you don’t feel anything bad if you behave like dissatisfied people. 

In Sahaja Yoga a person needs to have a balanced character - both intellect and mind should be balanced. I mean... if there is a foolish person... I am not saying educated, because even an educated person can be foolish. But he should be enlightened. Even an uneducated person can talk exceptionally beautifully on Sahaja Yoga. And even the most learned can interpret something like a donkey. Hence you should be enlightened. And many may think what enlightened means, they should have intensity. As well there has to be a softness of love. Such a person should have the warmth of love such that if someone is sad, his tears should flow instantly . Sahajayoga will not benefit from having dry people, but from having  people who genuinely care about others .This will truly benefit Sahaja Yoga. Now,why should this care reside in the heart? You should understand this because it leaves an impression. And everyone must be treated with utmost care and you should care about the smallest issue (of sahaja yogis) This meticulous care creates an impression of such a person.

But no... Otherwise finding faults like this person is like this or that... or complaints with his dressing, or this person did that and something happened. In fact, as you already know we have a varied group of people who have come into Sahajayoga. When I went to Singapore, there was a person who got his realisation with ease in Sahajayoga. He was a terrible drunkard, smoker and womaniser. All sorts of these things. But because he had wealth (good karmas) from his previous life... When he got realisation, such a fragrance spread everywhere. Despite his extremely good behaviour in previous lives, there seemed to have been absolutely no benefit in this life. So, thinking that all those good deeds did not bring him any benefit, he thought to give it all up and took to all these vices. All these bad things. All of that was driven out. All these things dropped off and he became a very genuine sahaja yogi. He is Muslim by religion. Hence, many people say: “That person is not good. He is a crook. Then how is he (a Sahaja Yogi) ?” I said: “Do not talk like this in front of me .Once someone has bathed and become clean, do we say he is still dirty?” It changes you radically as this is a living process, not a dead one. Just like, if we have built a house already, we cannot then improve the foundation of that house. However, human beings are living things and in them this is a living process. Just as if a tree gets  infested... even if it is in its roots, we can still remove the infestation. Similarly, in Sahajayoga. We can radically and thoroughly clean ourselves and remove it. But you have to be prepared for it. The person who has transformed is at a much higher position and the one who finds faults in this person is down at a very lowly state. Sahaja yoga is a churning and you need to stay at the top of this churning. The butter that I have put in that churning, you should keep on sticking to it. If you move away from it you are done for. Absolutely do not let it go. Don’t do such things. Everyone should latch on to each other. just stick (be together). Everyone should stick together and work together, praising each other. Just today, one person from Usalwadi (a town) came  and I was very pleased when he told me this. I say, if  you want to really please me then talk about such things. He said: “Mataji, just as Bhagiratha (a saint) brought Ganga to this earth for salvation of his brothers and sisters.., our Dhumal Patil is the same. After listening to this, my heart swelled up with joy. Waah Waah! In a similar way, keep praising each other. Look at each other with love and cherish each other with love. He is so good, he is so good... This is what makes the Mother very happy. This is what makes me joyous, content.

Once Gavin Brown visited me and said something very loving to me. It so happened that in his house many programs used to happen also. He spent a lot. Once it so happened that it was night time and everyone said these people will have dinner. However, I was not aware that he had made food for all of them. There were around a hundred people. I thought, when they go away slowly, then we can have food. Later, by 9 pm most of them left, leaving a few. 10 to 12 people remained. So I asked them to bring the food out. His face fell. In the morning with anguish he asked me why I asked everyone to go. He said: “We had cooked a lot of  food for all of them.” In my heart I felt... look at this. These are my real children.

One should learn to give. Miserliness should be left behind. If someone has miserliness on their mind, then they should be told they have holes in their head. Decency can not then exist. People should say... what a gentleman he is, truly a gentleman. Nowadays, we rarely see such decent people. People do remark to me that: “Such decent people. Where have you brought so many decent people from, Mataji? Where did you find such nice people?”. You need to be truly gentle and noble. So you can carry yourself respectfully. You should remain happy about your own qualities. These are called virtues. Yes, we are truly in our own ocean of joy and you get real happiness when you do this. One shouldn't have to shout it out from the rooftops. They will say: “You are useless. You didn't make any money.” You should reply saying: “We are happy in the richness of our lives in spite of our poverty.” You will find a new dimension in your own language. There are many people amongst you who have a radiance on their faces. The radiance has shown on your faces. If one becomes a saint, every one easily recognises that person. And you all are saints. Even if you wear any type of clothes; you don’t need to shout out on the streets .It is obvious and clearly evident that you are a saint. Do you doubt that a flower is indeed a flower? It cannot hide its fragrance. If kasturi (musk) is hidden and covered it will still be known that it is there. It doesn’t need to be verified. We all have this kasturi within us. And will give it to everyone. And why shouldn’t you? Each one of these fools have built very big ashrams and what have we done when we have become so enlightened? Give this a thought today when you get home. How many people have we given realisation and how many people have we told about Sahaja yoga. Most people think that Sahaja Yoga is a side issue.Yes, I am a sahaja yogi. So, that’s it. These people are called armchair politicians. They think they are Sahaja yogis on an easy chair. That’s it. At the most we can also attend when Mataji will come for a Sahaja yoga program. And even when you come you just say, Mataji we have come and now will be leaving. Is such a big task going to be done by these half hearted people. Anyway, the other thing I want to know is , what other work do you do? What else have you earned? Now really, put your hand on your heart and ask yourself, since coming to Sahaja yoga how much knowledge you have got and how much have you gained? Then why don't others deserve this? Shouldn’t you give them? Or do you only want to be happy on your own? I should not say this in Rahuri as people have done a lot of work in Rahuri. Despite this, more work should happen. And keep on going. It is so because I tell you Rahuri is our legacy. Even though you have rights over me, similarly I also have more rights upon you. Then it should be remembered that this village of Rahuri is going to cover the entire world. Taking this into consideration, spread this work as far as you can and it will spread and expand all over the world and also people will visit here as a holy place. These are my blessings to you all . 

Now let's meditate for some time . Everyone here is fond of Ganpati. Then think in your mind:  “Mother, are you Ganpati? And with full faith in your heart that Mataji is Lord Ganesha. In fact I am lord Ganesha. Think about this and establish this truth in your mind.

[Mataji is asking everyone to meditate now]

Stop all your thinking and enter into thoughtless awareness. Sink into its depth and experience this. If you wish to ask for anything then ask now. If you wish for anything... strength... ask for it now. All of you close your eyes and sit still. You will get thoughtless-ness.

Now the first question is why should you all humble down in front of me? We will answer this later. Second question is, You (Shri Mataji) are an incarnation. How, what’s the evidence? So far all incarnations whilst they were alive... no one recognised them. Jesus Christ was the real (sakshat) incarnation of Lord Ganesha. No one recognised him. He was crucified but he had told that he will resurrect and it was already prophesied that he will resurrect. When people saw him resurrect with their open eyes, only then they could believe. Not when he was living. By the time they recognised, he had already left. For all incarnations who came before me, similar sad stories happened. No one ever realised this and all incarnations ended. Humans have remained where they were as before. Since so many eras (yugas),,you should have had rebirth. You should meet your spirit. Your yoga should happen. These are all things that are already written. How all these happenings will materialise is also written. We don’t read Adi Shankaracharya or Upanishads (Hindu scriptures). Now the Kundalini energy within you will be awakened and get realisation. This has been announced by Saint Dnyaneshwar. The Bible has said that the Holy Ghost will come in the form of Adishakti who will comfort you and will destroy all the delusions about sins, good karmas and virtues and re-establish them. Even this has been described. Not exactly as me though; but in female form. Even Christ has said that you will be forgiven if you say something against him, but it will never be forgiven if anything has been said about the Adishakti form. In Kundalini shastra (science) specifically Adi Shankaracharya has described that without the blessings of the Divine mother (Jagadamba), the kundalini will not rise. After a lot of penance, few Gurus may be able to give realisation. But without Mother’s blessings this work will not prosper. There even is a description about how and where this kundalini lies and after being seen by the divine mother, this kundalini has to rise. Now the question arises here whether Shri Mataji does this work and whether really this kundalini rises or not? That you have yourself seen with open eyes and experienced that if you come near my feet the kundalini starts to flow. She rises with your power too but she will not move as much and won’t vibrate as deeply. First thing is that God created human beings with a desire that humans should recognise God. Then, humans were bestowed with everything they asked for. But a lot of chaos took place and the humans called out to the lord.  Then the lord himself appeared, but no one recognised him. Because they lived like normal ordinary human beings, no one could recognise them. Now finally, this task has fallen into my lap. And even if Krishna said so to Arjun: “sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja”. This means that you leave everything aside and believe in me. And Christ has said: “I am the light. I am the path.” He has said so. But then everyone ended up crucifying him. But then I am smart. I don’t ever say that I am an incarnation. But now that you have directly asked me this question, because I am one, so I have confessed to it. [the audience claps] Not just that, but all the incarnations till date - they have all been my Shaktis (my powers). Now if you understand this, this is an occasion to bring it all to a  completion. 

But even then, the confession is because at least then you should take this up as an experience. If you aren't even going to take an experience of this and then comment on why we should become humble in nature.... Here there is no need for humility. Yesterday, I told everyone not to fall at my feet, and that ended up angering people. If I ask them to do so, then they ask me why we should become humble. If I say don’t do so, then they say you didn't give us darshan [an audience]. There is absolutely no reason to come and fall at my feet. What you should understand from this is that I am not looking to gain anything from you. Just think about it simply - what should we get for Mataji? Is there something worth giving? What can be given? If we are in front of Her, then She doesn’t take any money. She says not to fall at Her feet. Absolutely don’t do so. Until you get your realisation, you should absolutely not approve of my sayings. But that also doesn’t mean that you should become a wall. I am talking for your own good. You should think about what good is going to happen to Her because of us? It’s not like I am standing for any election. By god’s grace, my husband is well to do. I have my daughters, my granddaughters. I am happy in my own life. There is nothing there to it. 

What can you give me? “Mataji works for us day in and day out – what can we give Her?” There is nothing you can give.  Now, what is there to be taken? When you are not well, you come to me. I don’t ask whether you got your realization or not. I just cure you. But if you open a hospital, I have nothing to do with it. If someone does not stand to gain anything from you, but you still receive help from that person, then the individual at least should be a decent person! At the very least! However, people don’t believe anyone can truly be good. Truly a good person.  People don’t believe someone can be genuinely good, because deep down, they themselves do not have a clean heart. Everyone thinks: “This woman has some hidden agenda. Something or the other behind her actions! Otherwise, why would she come here to Rahuri? Maybe she wants something from the councillor. There must be an underlying motive.” This means, they themselves have a self-serving intent. And therefore, they believe that there will be a bad intent here as well.

Then there are even more extremely subtle types (of thinking). Some people feel inadequate/ unworthy. As a result, they cannot believe that God incarnate is sitting here in person, right before them. They cannot believe it.  They feel, “I am nobody, so how is it possible? If I were special, maybe then... but I am not. So how is it possible? This is absolutely impossible! How can it be?” This reflects their own feeling of inadequacy. Shabri did not have this feeling of inadequacy. She knew that her devotion would bring Shri Ram to her in-person. She recognized Shri Ram.  She described him as such. Welcomed him. When you don’t harbour feelings of unworthiness about yourselves and instead think, “Why not? We are in Kaliyuga, searching for God. God will definitely appear before us”. This attitude will help you realize you don’t need to give me anything. What does your humility in my presence offer me? What is this humility... What exactly am I asking of you? At the most, take off your caps! In Marathi, “Topi Ghalne” has a different meaning altogether, isn’t it? While here, simply remove those black threads. What else am I asking of you? Neither am I taking these black threads home with me, nor am I going to set up a business with these!  You offer “venni, phani” (specific offerings) even to deities made of stone. But how many of you got flowers for me? “We did not even get flowers for Mataji, but we came here."  You should get something ... (this is an incomplete sentence. The tone is such that Shri Mataji does not expect anyone to get anything for HER). You did not get flowers because it was necessary for you to pay attention to my talk. It is all my doing – in one way or the other. Don’t feel bad that you did not even get a single flower. Doesn’t matter. “We are here to meet Shree Mataji after so many days. She is like our Mother. Just for that – something, as a token when we meet”. Did I feel bad about it? I did not say anything, not even to get a Tulsi leaf! Not even that. Once I see your heart full of love, I don’t need anything. And you know that in your heart! You know that Mataji only needs your heart full of love.  All I have to do is to look at your sparkling eyes and I know! Therefore, explain to everyone that Mataji does not need anything from you. Also, ask these two doctors sitting here if I have cured cancer or not. They will not lie. They have come from a foreign country. Note down their names, ask them.

Many diseases have been cured. You have witnessed the kundalini moving in the presence of Mataji with your own eyes. It is written (in the scriptures) that the Kundalini reverberates only in the presence of the Goddess. It is written that She is the Mokshadaayini (the one who bestows liberation). Only the Adi shakti can give moksha (liberation). This is what is stated in the Shastras (the scriptures). This proves that Mataji is indeed the Adishakti. There are many proofs. You should choose to seek those out. Everything happens through my desire! I desire; therefore, it manifests. Even if you manage to simply move the kundalini through your desire, I am willing to concede/ I will acknowledge your powers. Otherwise, it is simply jumping like frogs (talking big) ... this can happen and that can happen, but the kundalini does not even budge! Tell those people, “You raise one kundalini for us”. Then we will discuss. Further, I have awakened the energy for so many people. That too is true. So many people have been transformed, this has never happened during any incarnation till date. This is also a monumental task. Every incarnation worked out on different aspects. All of them have done their bit in preparation for Sahaja Yoga. Every incarnation had their merits in their era. And that all this will happen in Kaliyuga – this too is the truth.

Therefore, explain to people that this work has been done. That it happened in an extraordinary way. Instantly, and in many dimensions. Once the all-pervading power manifested within us, we started working on the chakras of other people. And this happened. This really took place within us; our kundalini was awakened. This is a true happening and we have witnessed it. Explain it to people. And if it did not cause us any harm, we only benefited from it, then why hesitate? What is the issue?

When a bull sits in the middle of the road, no matter what you do, the bull does not get up. It has only one remedy. Do you know what it is? Let me tell you if you don’t know.  Give pepper “dhuni” (smoke) near its nose. The bull gets up and starts walking. If you meet such (obstinate) people, don’t pay attention or waste your time explaining. Just tell them to go home and take pepper “dhuni” and say: “We will meet you next time” Don’t waste your energy on such obstinate people. What they exhibit is this massive ego. This is stupidity! Ego doesn’t affect children so much, but I have seen it affect the elderly. Ego continues to grow, and it becomes a bit pig-headed... what gets in their mind! Sometimes, people behave like animals! I don’t understand their behavior; exactly where are they with their heads? The foreigners, in particular, are so full of ego! There are children present, so I cannot describe their foolishness- such foolish people! They are so vile. While the older people here are mature and wise, the elderly people there are like big donkeys! Donkeys without tails. They do such foolish things; they act just like donkeys. I mean, even donkeys have some sense! Incredibly foolish people! This ego that makes you foolish, makes you act like a monkey... please bring this ego down. And know the swa-bhaav (the self), Ego... that is now spreading in India. It was not there in the past. This is because we now have education, don’t we... If this education is going to lead us to this kind of stupidity, then it is better not to have this kind of education either. I cannot even begin to describe the stupidity of people there. Imagine an 80-year-old woman writing a love letter to an eighteen-year-old boy! [unclear audio] And it gets properly published in the newspaper! What will you say about such people! And blatantly! Blatantly - this kind of foolishness! It gets even worse, but I gave a mild example.  And thinking of oneself as a 16-year-old girl or thinking of oneself as a 25-year-old boy, is something of a speciality in the elderly there. I don’t know what to talk to them about. I feel so ashamed about it! Such stupid elderly people there! Don’t let that ego penetrate here. If this ego makes you think like a monkey, ok... that is one thing. But as long as you don’t end up behaving like owls, you might say you achieved something (Mother is being very sarcastic in her tone).

Such is the nature of Ego. However, one cannot simply let go of it. We push forth using this as a support. So, it doesn’t leave us. Therefore, take to Sahaja Yoga... and the ego will fade away. I don’t need anything from you. You gain what you seek from me. But still, you know how people are. So, I am telling you something I learnt in this lifetime. Whenever you talk about me, don’t say “Mataji is Adishakti”. Immediately people will react (their bhoots will surface). Instantly! So don’t say that. Say that she is just like us, a housewife. They will tend to understand it better if you say “Saheb (her husband) is a big officer, and their salary is good” then they will understand that (despite all comforts) Mataji works hard for us. But if you say Mataji is Adishakti, that’s it! They will think there is no end of it. Slowly, gently, bring them around. I understand how the human brain works – so why provoke it? Let us give realization to as many people as we can, any which way we can. Because after this, the incarnation will arrive with the “ekadasha rudra”, that is with 11 rudras, with 11 destructive powers. The incarnation will not come to give you realization, or talks. Nor will it not fall at your feet.  Do you know that knife that has an edge?  It will come with a cutting edge. Be prepared. It will remove everything. So, save as many as possible.

 And remember, you cannot give me anything. If you were to first keep this in mind, it will at once make you humble. Whatever you can gain from me, do so. The Ganga is flowing, take it. Make your lives joyful. I do have one purpose that I must tell you – it is very subtle, please try and understand it. All this work God has done, all the energy he created a human being with... He has only one desire that whatever He created, that creation must recognize God, must feel the Divinity. And this task is only going to be accomplished by this modern Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga has been started with the purpose of getting to know God and this is the only main task.

Time has come to manifest whatever /everything that has been said about spirituality, and it is best if as many people as possible can join this movement. There are many examples for this, many miracles have taken place.  I am not asking anything from you. I don’t want you to fall at my feet. I would be very thankful if you didn’t fall at my feet. This is the situation.

<some conversation ensues> It was a good question. Please ask more questions. People have questions. But how like you all I have become... this you have not seen at all, have you? I am just like you. Do you see any difference? If I stood before you with a sword in my hand (in the form of a Goddess), would you be sitting here? Would you get your realization? It is a very difficult thing for humans.

Someone is asking a question: Should we let Dr. Rustom say something?

Shri Mataji: Yes, let (him) speak. Let everyone talk a little bit. Does not matter.  Today we are all Sahaja Yogis sitting here. Is there anyone who has not received their self realization? If so, raise your hand. Who is new here?

<<men talking in the background>>

Shri Mataji: So, only one who has not received realization? Come to the program once or twice. Sit with your hands like this. I gave you realization, or have I not? Do you feel the cool breeze on your palms? Whom are you a devotee of? You don’t get it? Why? Do you fear I will steal something from you? Then, what is it? Which deity do you worship? What? Mine? You don’t worship anyone?

Man: No one.

Shri Mataji: Then who do you worship? Means you do not worship any deity. Don’t you believe in God? You believe. In God. Ok. Then straightway ask a question “Mataji are you God?” Keep your hands like this. Ask the question. It is a big (important) question. Ask. Go on... ask. There is no harm in asking this.

Man: Are you God?

Shri Mataji: Ask me the question “Mataji....”

Man: Mataji, are you God?

Shri Mataji: Again

Man Asks the same question again

Man: it came- on the Sahasrara.

Shri Mataji: It came, Vibrations are flowing.

Shri Mataji: Now see, what is (flowing) in your hands; you can say you got the answer. You should see that this has happened. Got realization. Done now? Did you get your answer? Good. Did you get the answer to your question? Tell them.

Man: You tell them, you share what just happened.

Shri Mataji: Do you feel the cool breeze in your hands?

Man: yes.

Shri Mataji: he was unable to get his realization before he asked a question.  Now he received an answer in the form of a cool breeze in his hands. The breeze did not flow before he asked the question. The question is profound.

Everything is peaceful now, sit for meditation. We have a doctor with us here. You have not spoken to anyone here. Listen to their experiences together. We have Dr. Rustom with us. He was a well-known doctor. He specializes in Psychology, started working extensively on psychoanalysis etc. He has achieved a specialisation in it. Originally an Indian, he lives in London and practices in Germany. He was a disciple of Jung. Jung, who was a great psychologist. He [Rustom] is his student. Therefore, he understands a lot about psychology. He has also documented his dreams. Whatever his dreams, he has written them all down. He will tell you about his dreams before he met me. He says ever since he started practicing Sahaja Yoga, everything else seems incomplete. He has thus become a big Sahaja yogi now. The difference between them and us is that these people are very deep people. Their seeking is also profound. Therefore, as soon as they got realization, they understood its value. We don’t see the greatness/value because our seeking is not so intense. That’s the little difference. There are about 300 such good people in London, highly educated and extremely learned. Listen to them. They will share their experiences in Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji talks to yogis: You tell them how you found me and also about ... Will you translate it?
