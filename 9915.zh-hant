崇拜和火祭的重要性

1983年6月18日法國巴黎

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:你好!我們正在等你來這兒。哦,我想我要穿上毛衣了。你好!我們正在等你來,等Christopher來這兒。他怎麼了?很好。他的頭怎麼了?

瑜伽士:換牛奶,母親。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:哦,Christopher,你回來了?哦哦哦......你要蓋住他的頭,天還挺冷的。好了好了好了,怎麼了?他在冥想。【嬰兒發出哼哼聲】不不不不【錫呂‧瑪塔吉輕輕搖晃著嬰兒】你必須一直把他貼近身邊。最好幫他蓋多點兒。好了,你去裡面多拿點什麼。我想你也要穿上毛衣什麼的,外面還挺冷。

瑜伽士:謝謝您,母親。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:在他頭部多蓋點兒。

瑜伽士:這是來自奧地利霎哈嘉瑜伽士的禮物,奧地利霎哈嘉瑜伽士送給法國霎哈嘉瑜伽士的禮物。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:啊哈,漂亮。

格雷瓜讀著海報上面的文字:“我看見天堂開啟,凝望著天堂中呈現的一匹白馬。”

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:譯成法語。

終於把我的毛衣帶來了。Jenny可以拿來。

格雷瓜:把毛衣給母親。

蜜雪兒·C:母親,我有一兩件禮物獻給您。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:再說一遍?

蜜雪兒·C:第一件是我們從盧昂給您帶的軟墊,您可以用來墊腳。還有這個城市徽章。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:哦,我看看,這是什麼?

蜜雪兒·C:盧昂市的徽章

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:那是什麼?

蜜雪兒·C:盧昂市的徽章

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:這些標記是什麼?

蜜雪兒·C:三朵百合花。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:百合花?

蜜雪兒·C:百合花。我覺得它就像古代法國的一朵蓮花。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:漂亮。非常感謝你。

蜜雪兒·C:不用謝,母親。

錫呂‧瑪塔吉:嗯,你可以保管一下嗎?謝謝你。

天還挺冷的,風要吹散雲層了。我一到這裡,天氣就玩把戲,你們看,它總是捉弄你。【笑聲】是的,最好給他蓋好。你也穿暖和一點兒,我希望你們都穿得足夠暖和。

我很高興能和這麼多霎哈嘉瑜伽士在一起。他們中許多是新來的,對我來說不是新來的,也許幾千年以前我已認識你們所有人了。【錫呂‧瑪塔吉笑著】你們坐在陽光下。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你們都要知道一件很簡單的事情:你們都是永恆的靈,凡不屬靈的都不是你們自己。

我們可以把靈比作太陽。太陽會被雲層覆蓋,太陽上會有些疊影,但此時此刻,太陽依然是太陽。你們不能照亮太陽,只有太陽能照亮它自己。當雲層散去,疊影移開,太陽便光芒四射、穿透大氣層。我們的靈體也一樣,被無知所遮蔽。只要遮蔽仍在,你們便看不見靈體。即使少量雲層消失,那疊影還是存在。一定要晴空萬里,才能看見穿透而來的靈性之光。我們有許多方法可以設法去除那些雲層。

首先也是最重要的是這樣一種假定,一種信念:你們是個靈,其餘的都是疊影。你們必須在自己的內在做出這樣的假設,在得到自覺以後,這應該變得很容易:你們已遠遠超越你們現在的所知,你們已大不相同。

所以,現在新的情況出現了,你們這種信心不是盲目的,而是由經驗所得。因此不要用你們的聰明去對抗這信心,不要試圖挑戰它。如果你們的聰明挑戰信心,而你們又聽信了你們的聰明頭腦,那麼你們便會再次下跌。

即使只是瞥見空中一顆星星,科學家們也會相信那顆星的存在。因此,同樣地,即使你們只在一瞬間感覺到你們的自覺,你們至少要相信,你們也是個靈。你們要緊緊抓著那個經驗,並將注意力保持在你們是個靈這一事實上,告訴你們的聰明不要再欺騙你。由此,你們可以不用再理會你們的聰明。

此時,你們的聰明便會開始為靈性追求而工作,這就是信心的意思。信心能生出純粹的智慧。現在,你們看見大部分雲層都已散去,但還有一些雲翳。所以你們要用聖靈之風來驅散浮雲。你們知道,利用風的方法有很多。

我希望義大利人能理解。

這風源於別處,源於聖靈,源於你們自己的靈量。而且,你們還有太初靈量的力量在你們面前,與之前的許多求道者相比,我必須說,你們已經十分幸運。

因為崇拜一些雕像(Vigraha),哪怕大地之母為這雕像注入了生命能量,人們都會有很大問題。首先,他們必須做一種所謂Sarvikalpa Samadhi的冥想,即你們必須凝神在雕像上,即“vigraha”,“vigraha”的意思是含有生命能量的雕像。然後持續凝視此雕像,並嘗試提升靈量。

靈量過去常常上升至額輪,但躍升至頂輪之上則是不可能的事兒,因為一個人必須從“有形相”走到“無形相”,而擺脫“有形相”走到“無形相”這一步是非常困難的。即使是專注於抽象或“無形相”上,也是另一件做不到的事兒,就像穆斯林所做的,或其他許多人嘗試做的那樣。

在這種情況下,化“無形相”為“有形相”就成為必要,如此一來,對你們來說就不再複雜了。一旦你們專注於有形,便能成為無形。就好像你們面前有一塊冰,一旦你們用手去觸摸它,冰便融化,你們便會感覺到冰的清涼。因此現在這個問題被輕易地解決了。

崇拜便是一件你們可以將有形激發為無形的事情。現在,你們的(輪穴)中心是能量中心,所有這些輪穴裡也有主導神祇安坐在那裡,祂們也是化為有形的無形。當你們做崇拜時,有形便化作無形的能量,然後此無形的能量開始流動,之後便涼風吹拂。就這樣,這些錯誤認同、靈體之上的疊影就被去除了。

你們不能思考崇拜,整件事情都是發生在超越思維的領域。因此,你們必須認識到,你們不能對崇拜作理性解釋。你們應該讓輪穴得到最大的好處。為此,你們必須完全地只專注於崇拜,以及涼風如何湧動。這涼風會來處理,會驅散所有浮雲。

所以你唯一要做的或唯一的方法就是專注于崇拜,靜觀。你是一個見證者 (Seer)。見證者有兩個意思,你只是看,只是看著,僅僅只是知曉,這就是見證者。沒有任何思維,沒有任何反應,只是自發自然地看見和吸收,這就是見證者。這是做崇拜的最佳方式。

對我來說,有時這是個負擔,因為你們與神祇之間應該有一定的對等性,必須要存在某種平衡。你們念誦所有口訣,神祇都被喚醒了,但你們就在那裡卻又不想吸收任何東西進入內心。於是,我就不得不儲存所有那些我體內產生的、額外的能量。所以,如果你們敞開心扉並無思慮地觀看崇拜那就會好很多。。

今天我們會把崇拜方法的次序對調,先做火祭(Havana),後做崇拜,這樣會更好些。因為通過火祭我們將喚起火元素,它會燒掉所有的邪惡。當你們為我洗蓮足時,你們在做同樣的事;當你們點火,也一樣。今天我們會先做火祭,後做崇拜,二者是一樣的。你們可以用火或水來崇拜我。

火的本質是發光(tejas)。你們做火祭時,所有錯誤,所有邪惡都會被燒為灰燼,之後,光芒會顯現在求道者的臉上、身上,當你們做火祭的同時,空氣中也會充滿美好的生命能量。所以,我認為最好是先做火祭,然後再做崇拜。

願神祝福你們所有人!

Of course, always we have to praise Ganesha before starting any puja, so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

Alexandre: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha "Atvatham Shirsham".
Shri Mataji: Atharva, Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.
Alexandre: Then we’ll say in French, or in English, I don’t know, up to You.
Shri Mataji: All right, say it in French.
Or better to translate it because there are other people.
Alexandre: OK.
Shri Mataji: First English and then French.
Alexandre: And first, in Sanskrit we don’t say, Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s all right, I can understand English all right.
[Laughter]
It’s all mantras for Me to understand.
Alexandre: Shri Ganesha. Om tawme wa sakchat, Shri Ganesha sakchat, Shri Adi Shalti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha
The holy mantra of Shri Mataji. [The three great mantras]
[Ganesha Atharvashirsha in English and in French]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Voice is very beautiful. It’s good. All right, now.
Right now we’ll be having the fire. It’s all right.

Shri Mataji: Now, how do you make it [inaudible]
Alexandre: There’s already some, it’s behind.
Camila, there’s some work for you to do.
Come along. You can look after the fire.
Let others see the fire.
Alexandre: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu?
Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?
Shri Mataji: Yes, Vishnu’s names.
Alexandre: 108 names of Vishnu?
Shri Mataji: It would be better Vishnu’s names.
Have you got 1000 names?
Alexandre: Not, 108 names.
Shri Mataji: Devi’s?
Alexandre: Devi’s we can go.
Marie: The Devi’s names Mother we have a translation in French
Alexandre: 108. Mother is asking for 1000. We have Lalita Sahasranama.
Shri Mataji: But who knows Sanskrit? It’s in Hindi?
Alexandre: It’s written in French.
Shri Mataji: All right, then it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: The vibrated Kumkum.
Shri Mataji: Now you put some water in it and put it to all the people, now.
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me, from all these places, one from each centre should come forward.

One from Britany.
These are too big, I think. You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, downward. The bigger ones.

Maria? The triangle on the three sides.
Marie: Where do they come Mother, for the havan?
Shri Mataji: One on top of another, this be better. Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why.

Sahaja Yogini: Would You like some tea or?
Shri Mataji: Yes, it would be nice
Sahaja Yogini: More than water, you don’t want water, yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, something like a [inaudible] paper like thing, lighter.
Is that the light thing? And have you got camphor with you? Something lighter to be, underneath.
You don’t have anything. Make it smaller, smaller here, yes.
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath. Not underneath, put it on top.
Covering this. Yes, put these on top.
Yes, like that, yes, that’s the right thing.

You have to keep a hole in between. Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the centre.

All right, now arrange on top of this. Now, this is all right. Please cover with this [inaudible]. I think there should be a platform first. There should be a platform first and then, in the centre there should be a platform.
Yes, make a platform there, yes, down here, yes, that’s it. And on the platform- just wait, Marcus, on the platform you put another thing. That’s better, yeah. Do you have some more with you? All right. Like that, yes.
To begin with that’s sufficient.
That’s all.

Alexandre: Mother we have Vishnu Sahasranama Stotram and Shri Lalita.
Shri Mataji: But it should be in Sanskrit.
Alexandre: No, there is, also here it’s written in...
Shri Mataji: You can read that.
Alexandre: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So.
Alexandre: This is Vishnu’s names.
Shri Mataji: You’d like to do 108, yes? What we’ll do, we can do 108 of the Goddess and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that’s the best.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. All right.

Shri Mataji: And one from Paris also should be there, a new person.
Alexandre: A new person yes.

Shri Mataji: From Paris, someone. 58:36
Shri Mataji: Children, please, you’d better now [inaudible].
Marie: Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Marie: We have the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.
Shri Mataji: Oh. Where?
Marie: Here.
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]
Now, can you put something for Me there?
Alexandre: You want to sit here, on the chair?
Shri Mataji: You tell them also; I’ll guide them better.
Some chair.
Vanessa you come here, you come and sit here, this side.
You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me.
I’m worried about it.
[Cut in the video] 59:53
Alexandre: Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother?
We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi-
Shri Mataji: Be careful about it. Don’t be too near. Little further, it’s moving all the time.
Now say the mantra.
Alexandre: Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi, the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji.
[Collective mantra]
Shri Swaha Swamini who is a principle of-
Shri Mataji: No, no. What’s the?
Alexandre: Swaha Swamini.
Shri Mataji: OK. Swa-ha.
Swaha is the quality of the, of the fire which consumes everything. Swa-ha.
[Collective mantra]

Shri Mataji: Now, after every name that he takes, you have to take the thing from your hand like this, and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire. But those who haven’t got these things in the hand should take up just their hand like that, thinking that they have it in their hand, and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire. And you all should say “Swaha”. Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.
Alexandre: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. First, Mother, it’s all right?
Shri Mataji: First the Devi.
Alexandre: First the Devi, sorry.
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Mata namaha
OM, Swaha
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Maharajni namaha
OM, Swaha...

Shri Mataji: Now we’ll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight. Again, you distribute the rice, distribute it.
Alexandre: Is it enough, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Alexandre: Is it enough, it should be made quickly, the names?
Shri Mataji: What’s the time now?
Alexandre: The time?
Marie: It’s 2 o’clock, Mother.
Alexandre: 2 pm. We have only to be at 6.30 in Paris later on. But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before You and we can give a practical session to the people. Explain them to [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Then you should come at 6 pm.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.

Shri Mataji: You see, these people want to be there only for their body.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: One fellow, he has got back pain.
Alexandre: Yes, something like that.
Shri Mataji: He’s the only one who had. You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him.
Alexandre: Yes, all right, Mother. We’ll give him a treatment. No problem. I think we can manage.
Shri Mataji: You would like to do 108 [inaudible]
Alexandre: Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother, on how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves.
Shri Mataji: So, I think, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. OK.
[Collective mantras]

Shri Mataji: OK. What you call the finishing part of it [inaudible]. For that you have to use some sort of a fruit. Last thing. Would you have something? What is the special fruit of France?
Alexandre: The special fruit of France? Apples!
Shri Mataji: Apples, or you should have...
Alexandre: Strawberries, cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!
Shri Mataji: Grape is the best.
[Laughter]
Alexandre: You have to bless it, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That’s the real thing. You just bring that.
That’s all. This is not sufficient.
You bring it here, bring it here.
So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now. This is the end of the puja, it’s finished. Throw all that in there. All the, all the remaining things are to be thrown.
Yes, put it.

Now, we have put today the grapes in it. That means the grapes will lose their capacity to ferment.
[Laughter]

That’s the best. Ah, the wind is blowing now. So, let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold. [Inaudible]
The main thing was to have the havan today
[Hindi].
Alexandre: Mother, the dinner is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Alexandre: The lunch is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Not ready, is it?
Alexandre: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.
Shri Mataji: So, we’ll finish the puja.
Alexandre: Yes, Mother.
