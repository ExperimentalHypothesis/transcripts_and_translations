1983年6月18日 講於巴黎

[Starts at 9:04]
Shri Mataji: Hello, so we were waiting for you to come here. So, I think, I’ll get my sweater. Hello, we were waiting for you to come, for Christopher to come here. How is he? Very good. What’s happened to his head?
Marie-Amélia: Changing of milk, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: So, Christopher you are back, here? Oh, oh, oh...
You must cover his head. It’s very cold still.
All right. All right. All right. What’s the matter?
He is in meditation. [Baby complains] No, no, no, no, no.
[Shri Mataji rocks the baby]
You must keep him close, all the time. Better cover him more. All right, you’ll get something more from inside. I think you also wear your sweater or something. It’s rather cold outside.
Marie-Amélia: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Just cover him much more on the head.
Gregoire: This is a present from the Austrian Sahaja Yogis, Austrian Sahaja Yogis to the French Sahaja Yogis.
Shri Mataji: Ah! It’s beautiful.
Gregoire reads the word on the poster: “And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse”. Shri Mataji: Translate it in French.
At last I was to bring My sweater. Geneviève can bring.
Gregoire: Sweater for Shri Mataji.

Michel C.: Mother I have a gift, two gifts for you.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Michel C.: First is from Rouen we offer You the cushion where your feet are settled. It’s from Rouen. And the "armours" [city coat of arms] of the town.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. What’s this?
Michel C.: The blazon of the town of Rouen.
Shri Mataji: What’s that?
Michel C.: The blazon of the city, of Rouen.
Shri Mataji: And what are these marks about?
Michel C.: Three lilies.
Shri Mataji: Lilies?
Michel C.: Lilies. I think it’s like a lotus in France, in old kingdom.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Thank you very much.
Michel C.: No thank you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: So, can you keep it? Thank you.

It’s quite cold still. The wind will blow away the clouds. As soon as I came out here, it plays, you see, it plays some tricks with you all the time.
[Laughter]
Yes, better have him covered. And you too wear something warm.
I hope you are all warm enough.

很高興看見這樣多的霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者,他們許多是新來的,但對我來說卻一點都不陌生,也許千年以前我已認識你們。

[Shri Mataji is laughing] You are sitting in the sun.

在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你們要知道一件很簡單的事情,你們都是永恆的靈,凡不屬靈的都不是你們自己。

我們可以太陽來作比喻,烏雲可以把太陽掩蓋,烏雲可以把太陽包裹起來,但太陽還是存在於那裡。你們不能照亮太陽,只有太陽能照亮它自己。如果一旦烏雲散去,沒有了遮蓋,太陽便能照耀天際。同樣我們的靈(Spirit)為無知所掩蓋,這個掩蓋仍在,我們便看不見靈體。即使只有幾朵烏雲,那障礙還是存在的。我們要有晴朗的天空,永恆的靈才能照耀。我們有許多方法可以去除那些烏雲。

首要的是我們的信心,我們要相信自己是個永恆的靈,其餘的都是施設(Superimposition)。你們要內在這樣相信。在得到自覺以後,這應該是不難的。你們要相信,你比你所知道的自己要多,你的真我是很不同的。

現在的情況已是不同,你們這種信心不是盲目的信心,而是從經驗得來的。因此你們的頭腦 (Intellect)不要對抗。如果你們的頭腦開始對抗,而你們又聽信它的話,你便會降回去。就好像科學家,即使只是驚鴻一瞥地看見一顆明星,他們也會相信那星是真正存在的。同樣,即使你只能在一瞬間感覺到你的自覺,你也至少要相信,你是個永恆的靈。你要繼續把注意力放在這個經驗上,告訴你的頭腦不要再欺騙你,這樣你便可以擺脫你的頭腦。

這時你的頭腦便會開始為追求成為永恆的靈而工作,這就是信心。信心能生出純潔的頭腦。你看見過烏雲的確是可以去除之後,即使還有些烏雲剩下來,你也知道可以用強風,即那聖靈的風驅散它。這風是從外面來的,它來自聖靈的力量,亦即是我們的靈量。同時你們還有太初靈量的力量在你們之前,和過去那些求道者比較起來,你們是十分幸運。

因為崇拜那些神像(Vigraha),崇拜那些母親大地所造的,含有能量的石像是會引起很大問題。這些人首先要做一種叫Sarvikalpa Samadhi的初步靜坐冥想,把注意力放在那個神像之上。神像的意思便是含有生命能量的塑像,然後不斷凝望此塑像,嘗試提昇靈量。通常這樣做只能使靈量上昇至寬恕輪,卻無法到達自覺輪,因為要超越這一步,我們要從「有形相」進到「無形相」,這一步是很難的,即使是把注意力放在抽象或「無形相」上都很難。回教和其他許多宗教都試圖這樣做。由於困難若此,所以「無形相」要化為「有形相」,這時便一點都不複雜了。只要你們把注意力放在有形之上,便能成為無形。就好像有一塊冰放在你們前面,你們用手去觸摸它,冰便融化,你們便會感覺到冰的清涼。

因此現在這個問題很簡單的便解決了。崇拜便是你們可以通過有形到達無形的方法。你們每一個能量中心之上,都有神祇駐守在那裡,祂們是無形而來的有形。當你們作崇拜時,有形便化作無形的能量,此無形的能量流動,便成為風,這時那些遮蓋靈體的烏雲障礙都得以去除。

在崇拜中,你們不要去思考分析,這些都是超越思維的。因此你們要知道,不能將崇拜理性化。你們應該讓輪穴得到最大的好處。要得到這些好處,你們崇拜時要專心,感應涼風的流動,涼風便會自動去除那些烏雲。所以你唯一要做的是要專心,好像是旁觀者那樣毫不執著的去靜觀一切。

你們都是些見者(Seer),見者有兩個意義。一是他只是靜觀,他便成為知識,其間沒有任何思想,沒有任何反應,只是靜觀,便能自然而然地吸收。有時,我會覺得是個負擔,因為你們與神祇之間應該有分際,要有平衡。

你們唸誦那些口訣,神祇都被你們喚醒了,但你們卻不願開放心靈去接收,於是變成我是唯一一個要把能量儲存起來的人。這些能量都是從我身體中釋放出來的。所以如果你們能開放心靈,不要思考,只是觀看,那就好得多了。今天我們會把次序對調,先作火祭(Havana),然後作崇拜,這樣會好些。因為火祭可以喚起火元素的力量,燒掉那些邪惡。當你們為我沐足時,也是同樣道理,你們做火祭也是同樣道理。

今天我們會先做火祭,然後作崇拜,二者是一樣的。你們可以通過火元素或水元素來崇拜我。火元素的本質是那焰光,作火祭時所有那些不潔,邪惡都會被燒為灰燼,你們的臉上,身體周圍都會發出光芒,同時周圍環境也會充滿美麗的能量。

So, I think best thing will be to do the havan first and then the puja.

May God bless you all!

Of course, always we have to praise Ganesha before starting any puja, so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

Alexandre: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha "Atvatham Shirsham".
Shri Mataji: Atharva, Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.
Alexandre: Then we’ll say in French, or in English, I don’t know, up to You.
Shri Mataji: All right, say it in French.
Or better to translate it because there are other people.
Alexandre: OK.
Shri Mataji: First English and then French.
Alexandre: And first, in Sanskrit we don’t say, Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s all right, I can understand English all right.
[Laughter]
It’s all mantras for Me to understand.
Alexandre: Shri Ganesha. Om tawme wa sakchat, Shri Ganesha sakchat, Shri Adi Shalti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha
The holy mantra of Shri Mataji. [The three great mantras]
[Ganesha Atharvashirsha in English and in French]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Voice is very beautiful. It’s good. All right, now.
Right now we’ll be having the fire. It’s all right.

Shri Mataji: Now, how do you make it [inaudible]
Alexandre: There’s already some, it’s behind.
Camila, there’s some work for you to do.
Come along. You can look after the fire.
Let others see the fire.
Alexandre: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu?
Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?
Shri Mataji: Yes, Vishnu’s names.
Alexandre: 108 names of Vishnu?
Shri Mataji: It would be better Vishnu’s names.
Have you got 1000 names?
Alexandre: Not, 108 names.
Shri Mataji: Devi’s?
Alexandre: Devi’s we can go.
Marie: The Devi’s names Mother we have a translation in French
Alexandre: 108. Mother is asking for 1000. We have Lalita Sahasranama.
Shri Mataji: But who knows Sanskrit? It’s in Hindi?
Alexandre: It’s written in French.
Shri Mataji: All right, then it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: The vibrated Kumkum.
Shri Mataji: Now you put some water in it and put it to all the people, now.
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me, from all these places, one from each centre should come forward.

One from Britany.
These are too big, I think. You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, downward. The bigger ones.

Maria? The triangle on the three sides.
Marie: Where do they come Mother, for the havan?
Shri Mataji: One on top of another, this be better. Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why.

Sahaja Yogini: Would You like some tea or?
Shri Mataji: Yes, it would be nice
Sahaja Yogini: More than water, you don’t want water, yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, something like a [inaudible] paper like thing, lighter.
Is that the light thing? And have you got camphor with you? Something lighter to be, underneath.
You don’t have anything. Make it smaller, smaller here, yes.
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath. Not underneath, put it on top.
Covering this. Yes, put these on top.
Yes, like that, yes, that’s the right thing.

You have to keep a hole in between. Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the centre.

All right, now arrange on top of this. Now, this is all right. Please cover with this [inaudible]. I think there should be a platform first. There should be a platform first and then, in the centre there should be a platform.
Yes, make a platform there, yes, down here, yes, that’s it. And on the platform- just wait, Marcus, on the platform you put another thing. That’s better, yeah. Do you have some more with you? All right. Like that, yes.
To begin with that’s sufficient.
That’s all.

Alexandre: Mother we have Vishnu Sahasranama Stotram and Shri Lalita.
Shri Mataji: But it should be in Sanskrit.
Alexandre: No, there is, also here it’s written in...
Shri Mataji: You can read that.
Alexandre: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So.
Alexandre: This is Vishnu’s names.
Shri Mataji: You’d like to do 108, yes? What we’ll do, we can do 108 of the Goddess and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that’s the best.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. All right.

Shri Mataji: And one from Paris also should be there, a new person.
Alexandre: A new person yes.

Shri Mataji: From Paris, someone. 58:36
Shri Mataji: Children, please, you’d better now [inaudible].
Marie: Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Marie: We have the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.
Shri Mataji: Oh. Where?
Marie: Here.
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]
Now, can you put something for Me there?
Alexandre: You want to sit here, on the chair?
Shri Mataji: You tell them also; I’ll guide them better.
Some chair.
Vanessa you come here, you come and sit here, this side.
You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me.
I’m worried about it.
[Cut in the video] 59:53
Alexandre: Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother?
We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi-
Shri Mataji: Be careful about it. Don’t be too near. Little further, it’s moving all the time.
Now say the mantra.
Alexandre: Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi, the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji.
[Collective mantra]
Shri Swaha Swamini who is a principle of-
Shri Mataji: No, no. What’s the?
Alexandre: Swaha Swamini.
Shri Mataji: OK. Swa-ha.
Swaha is the quality of the, of the fire which consumes everything. Swa-ha.
[Collective mantra]

Shri Mataji: Now, after every name that he takes, you have to take the thing from your hand like this, and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire. But those who haven’t got these things in the hand should take up just their hand like that, thinking that they have it in their hand, and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire. And you all should say “Swaha”. Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.
Alexandre: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. First, Mother, it’s all right?
Shri Mataji: First the Devi.
Alexandre: First the Devi, sorry.
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Mata namaha
OM, Swaha
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Maharajni namaha
OM, Swaha...

Shri Mataji: Now we’ll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight. Again, you distribute the rice, distribute it.
Alexandre: Is it enough, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Alexandre: Is it enough, it should be made quickly, the names?
Shri Mataji: What’s the time now?
Alexandre: The time?
Marie: It’s 2 o’clock, Mother.
Alexandre: 2 pm. We have only to be at 6.30 in Paris later on. But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before You and we can give a practical session to the people. Explain them to [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Then you should come at 6 pm.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.

Shri Mataji: You see, these people want to be there only for their body.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: One fellow, he has got back pain.
Alexandre: Yes, something like that.
Shri Mataji: He’s the only one who had. You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him.
Alexandre: Yes, all right, Mother. We’ll give him a treatment. No problem. I think we can manage.
Shri Mataji: You would like to do 108 [inaudible]
Alexandre: Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother, on how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves.
Shri Mataji: So, I think, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. OK.
[Collective mantras]

Shri Mataji: OK. What you call the finishing part of it [inaudible]. For that you have to use some sort of a fruit. Last thing. Would you have something? What is the special fruit of France?
Alexandre: The special fruit of France? Apples!
Shri Mataji: Apples, or you should have...
Alexandre: Strawberries, cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!
Shri Mataji: Grape is the best.
[Laughter]
Alexandre: You have to bless it, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That’s the real thing. You just bring that.
That’s all. This is not sufficient.
You bring it here, bring it here.
So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now. This is the end of the puja, it’s finished. Throw all that in there. All the, all the remaining things are to be thrown.
Yes, put it.

Now, we have put today the grapes in it. That means the grapes will lose their capacity to ferment.
[Laughter]

That’s the best. Ah, the wind is blowing now. So, let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold. [Inaudible]
The main thing was to have the havan today
[Hindi].
Alexandre: Mother, the dinner is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Alexandre: The lunch is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Not ready, is it?
Alexandre: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.
Shri Mataji: So, we’ll finish the puja.
Alexandre: Yes, Mother.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
