It was a great concert today and I'm sure you'll always remember this one.

The way it was all played so well, I have no words really to describe my joy. But all of you have started now appreciating classical Indian music is a very great thing for this great art. I had a fear that it might disappear one day because people do not have that depth to feel the beauty of this great music. But I'm happy to say that all these sahaja yogis all over the world enjoy classical music so much. I have to thank Mrs. Rajam, especially my daughter and Mr. Ramkumar Mishra for giving us such a nice, beautiful idea about how great is our music in our country. We have to spread it all over the world and let people see for themselves how soothing, comforting, relieving also how joy giving it is. I'm happy that she has made it possible to come, though she has to go somewhere else. The whole night she has kept awake and despite that she has played the whole thing with such concentration and with such creativity which is unimaginable. The daughter also is doing very well now. She has a little daughter of three months.

She has left her there and came away just to play for you. It is very kind of them. Also Mr. Ramkumar Mishra is such a young boy, I should say, but he plays so well and how he keeps the pace with the musician, he doesn't show off in any way, nor does he try to outpeak them. So beautiful we call it the Sangat. In the way he accompanies, accompaniment is really to be understood with what patience and balance he does it. I hope all this concert will also inspire you to learn classical Indian music and to show your appreciation by learning it as well. May God bless you all.
